0,Leofwine_draca,Quite routine,5,27 February 2018,"CREEP is another found footage horror flick from the team at Blumhouse Productions. I found it suffered somewhat for having no script; as believable as they are as actors, the guys on screen can't be expected to do all the work themselves and as such the dialogue often feels repetitive and low key. The story is a simple two-hander about a video blogger who answers a Craigslist advert to spend time with a man dying of cancer. It soon becomes a psychological battle of wills between the two characters. Nothing much happens here, other than a few very mildly creepy moments, and the only time it really hits home is at the powerful twist climax. Otherwise I found it quite routine.",Creep
1,SnoopyStyle,bland indie horror,5,21 June 2018,"Videographer Aaron (Patrick Brice) takes a job to film oddball Josef (Mark Duplass) living in a remote mountain cabin. Josef claims to be a cancer survivor and that this is a video for his unborn son. At first, Josef is simply an energetic oddball with fascinating stories. His awkwardness turns darker and darker. As Josef sleeps, Aaron takes a call coming into the house. It's Josef's sister. She warns Aaron to leave immediately.This is a two hander and let's face it, Aaron is a dud. He's mostly behind the camera but he isn't much even when he's on screen. Mark Duplass is pretty creepy but the intensity isn't there. That leaves the movie with little tension. Patrick Brice is directing and it may work better if Aaron is played by a woman. This is an indie horror with limited scares. It's a bad way to use found footage for a horror movie. By extending the timeline, this becomes a low intensity stalker movie rather than a scary horror. Even the big climatic scene has its own problem. Josef's shadow goes over Aaron who must be able to see him coming.",Creep
2,kosmasp,Boo,3,16 October 2014,"You could call it a character flaw and someone even suggested to me, that it was a nice ""character touch"". But having someone jump in front of the camera once is kind of stupid. Having him do it at least 6 times, is beyond ridiculous. Whatever the ""excuse"" for this behavior might be. Not to mention the other guy who falls for that stuff. The ending can be seen as powerful, but really: Why would he go there? There is no reason he would do so ... even with a camera filming it all. Something our bad guy supposedly did not know, but still managed to get another ""boo"" moment out of.It's actually a shame, because he plays it really great. Our villain is the main attraction and not the guy who is ""filming it all"" (yes found footage again, did I not mention that yet?). But he's also that impressive that he overshadows the other guy. So much so, that you don't really care about that guy, who's making money out of filming people (for whatever reason). Mostly not plausible, especially the way our ""sane"" guy acts. Shame then ...",Creep
3,gavin6942,Surprisingly Good For How Simple It Is,6,24 July 2015,"When a videographer answers a Craigslist ad for a one-day job in a remote mountain town, he finds his client is not at all what he initially seems.Initially, I was very skeptical that this would be very good. It seems to have a cast and crew of around ten people, which is not often enough to make a movie. And then it is found footage, which is by far the worst trend in horror today. Even more than zombies, which is hard to believe.There are moments that make no sense, because you might wonder why a camera would be on. That is a fault most found footage has. But you sort of have to accept that aspect. And then, it sort of gets better as it goes. Not because it's brilliant, but because the performances are rather effective. Scripted dialogue comes out sounding natural and ""the creep"" is just weird enough to be believable and disturbing.",Creep
4,BA_Harrison,"Peachfuzz, you say? Been nice knowing you pal (**backs away slowly to the door**).",5,24 July 2015,"Cash-strapped videographer Aaron (played by the film's director Patrick Brice) is offered $1000 for a day of filming, discretion appreciated. Travelling to a remote property in the mountains, Aaron meets his client Josef, who explains his requirements: as a cancer sufferer, Josef would like to create a video diary for his unborn son (who he has already named Buddy), and would like Aaron to document his every move during the day.Things start off strangely, Josef immediately stripping off to share a bath with an imaginary Buddy, but his behaviour becomes even more erratic and suspicious as the day goes on, with some particularly strange stuff involving a wolf mask. Having already accepted payment for the day, Aaron takes things in his stride, but alarm bells really start ringing when the time comes for him to go home and he cannot find his car keysI'm not the biggest fan of found footage horror, but was surprised to find myself drawn in by the unusual nature of Creep's antagonist Josef, who is, without a doubt, a very disturbing (and disturbed) individual. Although it's obvious from the outset that he's full of crap, blatantly lying about his illness, his bizarre behaviour and the mystery surrounding his real motives kept me watching.What a shame, then, that the film fails to live up to its early promise, any hope for a truly demented denouement dashed as Josef is revealed to be nothing more than your average common or garden obsessive homicidal nut-job.Aaron's actions throughout the film also undermine its effectiveness: I could get past the dubious notion that he would accept a job without any prior details, but his decision making skills thereafter prove increasingly questionable, the character failing to react in a logical fashion (only one call to the police, even with all that evidence-gimme a break!). There are also numerous scenes that will have the viewer questioning why Aaron would continue filming given the situation (a common complaint about found footage films).An over reliance on very silly jump scares (one of Josef's strange traits is to hide from Aaron and then jump out on him) soon gets tiresome, and a daft ending where Aaron makes one last really, really, really bad decision is the final nail in the coffin.",Creep
5,view_and_review,Two Actor Movie Doesn't Cut It,4,17 January 2016,"""Creep"" is a found footage film (FF film or FFF). One of the biggest problems of FFF's is making it seem natural to be filming whatever events are occurring. The most bogus and unwatchable FFF's are those in which it defies common sense and common practices to be filming; e.g. filming while running for your life, filming while investigating something when you may need both hands or filming when a close relation is being murdered. They avoid that the majority of the movie but not entirely.FFF's are like any other movie, there are good ones and bad ones. This is not one of the better ones. They saved a ton of money on this movie because there were only two actors, Aaron (Patrick Brice) and Joseph (Mark Duplass) (if you don't count the female voice on the other end of one of the phone calls). Having only two actors had it's advantages in that the camera was focused on one or the other the entire movie so there weren't a lot of characters for the one camera to follow. The disadvantage is that you have to watch the same two characters the entire movie.It was slightly interesting but just painfully slow, even as quirky and vibrant as Joseph was. There's not much known about either character. Aaron is a videographer that needs money and Joseph is a lying, conniving, I-don't-know-what. Really, at the end of it all we know nothing about Joseph except that he has some screws loose. This movie barely held my interest and it was only in hopes to see something happen. Not much of anything occurred the entire movie until the end and it was a rather tame ending.",Creep
6,evanston_dad,A PSA Against Answering Craigslist Ads,8,28 October 2015,"All promises to the contrary, the found footage horror genre is alive and well and will apparently never go away. I guess the idea of everyday people capturing moments of significance on random electronic devices is just too compelling to leave alone. We all want to believe that our lives matter, and what better way to prove that than to document them for the world to see? So when I watch yet another found footage film, I'm comparing it to all the other found footage films I've seen, hoping it brings something creative and new to the party. The bar is set pretty low, so it's not hard to be a stand-out example of the genre.Patrick Brice's effectively creepy ""Creep"" gets at least one major thing right: it gives its protagonist a plausible motive for keeping his camera running and trained on everything that transpires when anyone else would have ditched the camera and begun running for their lives. Brice himself plays that protagonist, a videographer who answers a personal ad to meet up with a stranger and film him for the day for an easy $1,000. When he first meets this guy (played excellently by Mark Duplass), he's perhaps weirded out a bit but not enough to abandon the job. After things go really wrong and the guy proves to be a nut, and potentially a dangerous one, he continues to film everything so that he'll have documented evidence.Lots of details about ""Creep"" don't really add up when you stop to think about them. Coming to the message boards afterwards made me realize how much of the film I took for granted when I should have been questioning. But I guess that's a testament to how well it's made, that in the middle of it I was agreeable to going along for the ride and didn't find the implausibilities egregious enough to take me out of the movie. Mark Duplass is really good in this film, totally convincing as a psycho. I'm not sure how much I like the big reveal at the end, but I'm used to horror movies having endings that let me down, so I care more about the journey than the destination. ""Creep"" delivers on that score.Grade: A-",Creep
7,morrison-dylan-fan,""" But I'm a creep, I'm a weirdo,What the hell am I doing here?,I don't belong here.""",7,6 October 2016,"Taking a look at Kim Newman's page in an old issue of British film mag Empire,I noticed that Newman gave a special mention to film. Which had received a very negative review in the wonderful British genre mag The Dark Side,this led to me deciding that if it was time to find out for myself how creepy this creep is.The plot:Taking a look at ads on Craigslist,film maker Aaron spots a wanted ad from Josef,asking for a film maker to do one day of filming with him at his log cabin home.Accepting the job,Aaron goes to meet Josef.Meeting Josef,Aaron is told that he is needed due to Josef dying of cancer and wanting to leave a video for his unborn child.Making sure to capture every moment requested,Aaron starts to see another side to the child-like innocence of Josef.View on the film:Whilst the jolts can be slightly disconcerting,co-writer/co-star (along with Mark Duplass) director Patrick Brice creeps a claustrophobic atmosphere over the film,as each hand held camera move traps Arron in the house. Nodding to the Blair Witch,Brice nicely balances the Found Footage shudders with a dark comedy Mumblecore edge,with the grainy appearance giving Arron & Josef's relationship a rustic mood.Starting as a film maker in the Mumblecore genre,the screenplay by Mark Duplass and Brice displays clear signs of their roots,by the limiting of just 2 characters allowing the writers to give Aaron and Josef chilling breathing space.Making it an intimate affair with just two characters,the writers impressively stop the title from drying up by using the Found Footage format to deliver chilling shots,which despite stretching things a bit, (I would have called the cops in minutes!) does allow for Josef to slither around Aaron,as he reveals himself to be a creep.",Creep
8,trashgang,nothing creepy at all,3,28 January 2016,"Thought this was going to be a scary ride sadly it wasn't. What we have are only two actors , the 'creep' was actor, director and writer so he surely knew what he wanted but trying to make a flick about a weirdo, a killer by following him with a camera and showing it like a found footage doesn't make a good flick. There's no moment that it ever was scary at all and there's no drip of blood to spot. Not that you need blood to make it scary (remember Halloween 1978) but you need to give it an atmosphere that gives you goosebumps. Henry, portrait of a serial killer (1986) was a good flick about serial killers but this one here was one boring ride. A lot of blah blah and only the last minutes things go a bit awry.

9,StevePulaski,Strips down to the minimum to offer maximum entertainment,9,29 June 2015,"The locations, the lack of many characters, the simple, unremarkable settings, and the lack of any special effects make Creep a film almost anybody could make, but its deceptively thoughtful writing and visceral, effective acting make it a film that few could really make well. Creep is far and beyond the most tantalizing and unsettling film of the year, taking mumblecore horror films to the next level with its pacing and muted aesthetics despite a threadbare plot and minimal action.We focus on Aaron (Patrick Brice), a videographer looking to make a quick buck via Craigslist. He takes a job offered by a man named Josef (Mark Duplass), who requires a simple video shoot throughout his spacious cabin. Josef tells Aaron early on that he has been diagnosed with terminal cancer that will kill him in the next three months and he won't be able to see the birth of his child. The video project involves Josef talking to his son and playfully interacting with him, such as engaging in a ""tubby time"" together in the bathtub.Josef's personality is loud and unpredictable; he believes in the miracles of life, as him and Aaron venture into the woods and get lost, in addition to Josef repeatedly scaring Aaron or revealing very personal and often disturbing stories about him. Throughout the film, Josef progressively becomes more and more off, but not in the blatant way films portray oddball characters. Josef's demands of Aaron don't grow more specific and haunting, but his general attitude and bipolar personality does, resulting in Aaron becoming concerned for his safety.Duplass, who may just be my favorite actor working today, is masterful here. Traditionally, Duplass takes on the role of a listless soul or a stubborn cad with little concern for the feelings of others. In Creep, Duplass inches his stubborn cad role just a tiny bit further into manipulative and unpredictable territory, becoming a haunting screen presence throughout the film. His character is just charismatic enough to believe and just mesmerizing in his ability to be persuasive that you can't take you eyes off of him. Duplass has played many roles and characters well, but this is the first time where he is the driving force behind a project that isn't his own in a directorial sense.Co-writer/producer/director Brice, however, shouldn't go unnoticed. With every manipulator comes the manipulated and, while delegated to the ostensibly thankless role of being on the losing side, Brice handles his role with conviction and a great deal of control. Brice never becomes too animated with his role nor too obsessed with conjuring up loud, thespian-esque fright or overblown reactions to things happening. He's collective and even-tempered throughout the entire film, even when things get dark.The real friend to Creep is its pacing, which is intense and consistently frightening. Brice and Duplass conduct this film in a way that flows like a stream of consciousness, never offering hefty, unrealistic plot points and simply go with the flow. This allows for a very naturalistic flow and pace to build, like many other mumblecore films. The film strips down all aesthetic flair and simply allows for pulsating tension, unsettling sequences, sprinkles of humor, and strong performances to carry the film.Consider Duplass's ability to haunt in the aforementioned ""tubby time"" scene, where Duplass sits in a bathtub, pretending to wash and play with his baby, going as far to nibble their imaginary toes and snuggle with them on his chest. The scene is incredibly unsettling because of Duplass's capability to leave us uneasy at his level of involvement with this personal project of his. That, combined with the minimalist directorial and aesthetic flair, and all you have left is a wave of unsettling fear.Creep is an immensely strong effort, and Brice makes a splash on the independent scene, releasing this and his other film The Overnight (soon to be seen by me) alongside one another. Brice makes the kind of splash Mark Duplass and his brother Jay made on the indie scene, following the release of their 2005 Sundance debut The Puffy Chair amidst a plethora of early short projects. This kind of work early on in a career is startling and makes me anxious for what's to come from yet another soul unafraid to strip his filmmaking tactics down to the bare minimum to, in turn, offer the maximum in entertainment.Starring: Patrick Brice and Mark Duplass. Directed by: Patrick Brice.",Creep
10,KineticSeoul,"Made with a shoestring budget, but it's totally worth it",8,18 October 2015,"I think this movie got a some hate because of it's shoestring budget. Despite that, I thought it was executed really well for one of those found footage movies. Sure, it has some jump scares...But it doesn't rely on those jump scares but kind of makes fun of it by not taking it seriously. I will say this film really isn't all that scary, but like the title it is pretty darn creepy. And it also has some cleverly executed suspense and build up. This film is also really innovative with it's dark humor. It doesn't seem forced or corny and just comes off natural. Uncomfortable, but the dark humor seemed natural. Sure there are some generic found footage elements in this, but it actually mocks that. Now the creepster in this movie is one of those guys that you probably encountered in real life. You know, one of those very talkative guys that is a bit socially awkward and there seems to be something off. I think that is what makes this film even creepier. It does have few parts that seemed to drag a bit. But when it comes to the accomplishment with the resources they had. This film is for the most part is unpredictable. It's actually pretty great because it actually inspires people that loves movies and likes to make films at homemade movies. This film will influence other movies in the future.8/10",Creep
11,FeastMode,my notes,1,25 July 2019,"Some of these ratings have been baffling me lately. i watched this movie and knew from basically 5 minutes in that this was going to be terrible. i watched most of it on fast speed, this movie is only an hour and 17 minutes long including credits, i finished it in like 50 minutes, and i was still bored and questioning why i was watching this. it's really weird and not in a good way. nothing happens. it's completely useless and could have been made by a film student with a $50 budget. horrible useless predictable jump scares throughout the movie. this isn't scary or creepy at all (1 viewing)",Creep
12,Edvis-1997,5,5,28 January 2021,"A bit overrated. It wasn't very good acting, that's for sure. For real, that's how maniac,serial killer,stalker would act, like this guy did. Plot was okay, he wanted to get his victim scared because that makes him happy and after that get rid of it. The only problem I see is that when you see any of Red flat, for example, when he wanted to be filmed in bath naked or go to forest alone with stranger you shouldn't do it and get from there ASAP. I wouldn't recommend to watch it because I found it a bit boring. Maybe two stories would fit better and could make it more interesting and violant to watch.",Creep
13,Pjtaylor-96-138044,Tubby time.,6,28 October 2020,"At least for its first half, 'Creep (2014)' is essentially just a piece of mostly improvised performance art from Mark Duplass that's reacted to, in an equally improvised manner, by his co-star and director Patrick Brice, who films the affair in a distinctly documentary style. This naturally lends an air of unpredictability and believability to proceedings, as Brice reacts in a totally unbiased fashion to the often odd things that Duplass says and does. This doesn't mean that the overall film is directionless, however; it comes together as a surprisingly complete whole, with only a couple of elements getting caught on their unique execution. The second half isn't as successful as the first because it devolves into much more laboured, plot-heavy and, frankly, generic fare. Its ultimate payoff is rather disturbing, though; in that sense, it sticks the landing. In general, the movie is more intriguing than it is entertaining. Its two-half approach leads to an off-balance pacing, and its general subtlety is more disquieting than distressing and, as such, takes its time to take hold. It's straightforwardly enjoyable on a few occasions, though. Plus, a few of its sequences are, indeed, quite creepy. In general, it's an engaging experience. Even isn't quite as impactful as it perhaps could have been, it's an interesting experiment that mostly pays off. 6/10",Creep
14,Thanos_Alfie,Awkward...,6,25 April 2020,"""Creep"" is a Thriller - Horror movie in which we watch a man accepting a job from an advertisement without knowing a lot about it except only that he will need a camera to film another person and some hours of his time. After meeting the other person and starting filming him, he is observing that the behavior of the other man is very strange and starts questioning everything happened so far.I have to admit that I had very low expectations from this movie but I was happily surprised by it. I am not saying that is a masterpiece but it is a good, creepy and strange horror movie which in many scenes will make you fell uncomfortable but I am sure that you won't stop it because you will want to know what will happen next. The interpretations of both Mark Duplass who played as Josef and Patrick Brice who played as Aaron were very good and I believe they succeeded both on their parts making us feel what they both characters were feeling. The direction which was made by Patrick Brice was good, with much of suspense and plenty of awkwardness.",Creep
15,jtindahouse,Brilliant,9,26 June 2015,"I love that feeling when you go into a movie with zero expectations and within the first 5 minutes you are captivated and know you are watching something great. That's exactly what happened here. The 'found footage' theme worked absolutely perfectly. It really added to the feeling of isolation and seclusion at the cabin and also worked extremely well for some of the scares.For a movie that literally only features two people (plus one other voice on the phone) there is never a single dull moment. I was enthralled from minute one right through to the perfectly executed ending. Director, writer and star (there really can't have been many people that worked on this) Patrick Brice does an exceptional job in all three aspects for his debut film. Mark Duplass is also exceptional in his role. He really nails the character and plays 'creepy' perfectly. The final video he sends to Brice's character is a truly masterful piece of acting on his part. I was thrilled to read this is only the first in a trilogy. Bring on the next two I say!",Creep
16,jadavix,A small classic,8,12 March 2018,"""Creep"" is a classic, one of the best horror movies of the new millennium. Mark Duplass is superb in his role of Josef, perhaps the titular ""creep"". The found footage thing gets a bad rap, but it has been done to superb effect before: consider ""Man Bites Dog"", ""Blair Witch Project"", ""Paranormal Activity"", and the short film ""Safe Haven"". ""Creep"" is another classic to add to this list.The film really only involves two actors, and I was surprised, in a sense, to hear that it is mostly improvised. Before watching ""Creep"", I would have had a hard time imagining improvisation working in a horror movie. It seems like you could all too easily stray from the fearsome undercurrent each scene is supposed to carry with it - or, you could try to make everything you say scary, and thus merely become ridiculous.It must have been a tightrope, but Duplass and Brice were more than up to the challenge.""Creep"" has possibly the most naturalistic acting seen in a found footage film since ""Blair Witch"".",Creep
17,GiraffeDoor,What found footage was made for.,9,13 February 2019,"If you are sick of found footage or even if you never liked it at all, please give this movie a chance.I usually hate improvisation in movies. It almost invariably provides the most excruciatingly messy and boring dialogue on film (like This is Spinal Tap and Confetti).But for whatever reason they made it work here. Perhaps it was a free plot structure or the limited number of characters but there is a rawness rarely seen in found footage but at the same time has such personality in both its main characters.Josef is such a vivid character that would get anyone on edge. Watching the first time I regretted that they didn't keep their cards closer to their chest with Josef's disquieting nature but now I see him as someone who always has something chilling to say.This got under my skin in way that is hard to do. More than some kind of incorporeal terror, getting trapped in Josef's terrible world really hits raw nerves in me.One of the very best horror movies ever that will reignite your faith the bottom of the barrel has not yet been scraped.",Creep
18,estebangonzalez10,Not a character I was interested spending time with.,4,21 July 2015,"""Tubby time.""It seems that I watched a different film from everyone else, because I found Creep to be extremely dull and at times painful to watch despite its short running time. This low budget found-footage film doesn't actually do anything new for the horror genre other than make it overly simple and minimalistic. This mumblecore experimental artistic film focuses exclusively on two characters: Aaron (Patrick Brice) and Josef (Mark Duplass). Aaron responds to a Craiglist ad for an 8 hour job in an isolated mountain town. All he has to do is film his client. Josef explains that he is dying and wants to leave his unborn son a video of him so that he gets to know him kind of like in that Michael Keaton film, My Life, he explains to Aaron. The very next thing he does is get in the tub and imagine he is bathing and playing with his son there. That incredibly stupid scene was the first personal warning for me. As much as I like Mark Duplass, his character here behaves in such an annoying way that I could barely stand him. There are like five scenes in which he jumps right in front of the screen to scare Aaron, and none of them work. These repetitive scenes get more annoying as the film moves forward to a very predictable finale. There isn't any doubt as to what Josef's true intentions are so not much comes as a surprise. Patrick Brice directs and stars in Creep and he also co-wrote the script with Mark Duplass who helped produce the film. It is basically a two man crew and probably one of the cheapest films ever to be made. That is why Brice deserves some credit because he has managed to make a film out of a fairly simple concept. It probably could've worked best as a short film because several of the scenes here felt repetitive and slow. Of course they wanted to make it longer so they could have more bizarre conversations with each other, but the dialogue didn't really work for me like in other mumblecore films. I didn't find it funny either as some of the jokes felt forced. A film like Creep relies almost exclusively on the dialogue because from a technical standpoint it can't offer much, but unfortunately I never found the interactions between both actors interesting at all. Creep isn't a film I'll be recommending to my friends despite the positive reviews it's been receiving. http://estebueno10.blogspot.com/",Creep

21,aidanratesmovies,It has its moments...,5,16 July 2020,"Original, admirable, but ultimately muttled and somewhat lacking- Creep seems like it has the potential to be an amazing horror film, but instead settles for average. I have to admit, I did warm up to the film more as it went on, but that isn't to excuse the slow pacing of more than half of it, and its largely forced jump scares. There isn't a whole lot of this movie that I would consider scary, just a lot of weird jump scare moments that pop out at you, seeming to make sure you are still paying attention. It was that reason that I found the film a bit lazy, which was disappointing, because as it got closer and closer to the end, I felt it was at its most interesting point. The unfolding of the character Josef, stalking Aaron in the later portions of the film were far more interesting and creepy to watch than anything it had to offer in the beginning. I understand it had to find a starting point, and I understand that Josef himself was meant to be an odd character, but I can't help but feel the combination of the two plot lines feels oddly uneven, and just wish a little more time was put into making it a more solid and consistent film. The writing in the film, or forced line delivery anyway, seems quite out of place, and very obvious, which really takes away from the whole factor of the film as well. That all being said, I did feel like the actors, namely Mark Duplass as Josef, worked best with what they had. I found the found footage angle for this type of film interesting, but somewhat lacking, and I actually did like quite a few of the shots in the film. Creep seems amateur, and a bit messy, but not a totally bad start. In the end, Creep has some to offer, but ultimately it isn't a very satisfying flick. Creep is not a bad film, but not one I would really want to watch again, and one I feel like could be made better if better filmmakers were involved.

22,Reviews_of_the_Dead,Solid Up Close and Personal Found-Footage Film,8,31 July 2021,"This film is one that I sought out, because I started doing year end lists for horror. I was late to the game, but the sequel was out so I figured I'd watch these back to back. I knew the buzz, so that was about it for that first viewing. I am now giving it a rewatch as part of the Summer Challenge Series for the Podcast Under the Stairs. Our synopsis is a young videographer answers an online ad for a one-day job in a remote town to record the last messages of a dying man. When he notices the man's odd behavior, he starts to question his intentions.Much like the synopsis states, we start with the videographer Aaron (Patrick Brice) as he heads to the cabin to meet with his subject. He is a little leery about it, but none the less goes up to the door. He knocks, but no one answers at first. He looks over the railing and sees an ax. Having gotten no answer, he goes back down to his car to call the number he has for contact. Someone then scares him by knocking on the window. It is Josef (Mark Duplass), the man who hired here. He convinces Aaron to come up to the house.There we learn what the job is supposed to be. Josef states he has cancer and his wife is pregnant. He wants to do like Michael Keaton did in My Life and record a diary to give to his unborn child. Josef just got back from a run, making sense why he didn't answer the door and he is going to get cleaned up. He has Aaron join him while he gets in the bath, one of the first weird things as Aaron films him in the tub. He acts how he would if he was going to bath his new child.Josef then wants to go on a hike to show Aaron something. There is an awkward scene of Aaron checking in a closet for a heavier jacket to find a wolf's head mask. It spooks him. Josef tells him a story about the mask involving his father and why he shouldn't be scared.They go for the hike where there is an odd rock formation that is shaped like a heart. Josef scares Aaron a couple of times while being on this excursion. There is a moment as well where Josef writes their initials and puts a heart around it. He asks if he is hungry and they go to a local diner that is supposed to have great pancakes. Once there, it seems like Josef has never been this to place before.It is dark when they get back to the house and Josef convinces Aaron to come in for a whiskey. Aaron reluctantly agrees. Josef becomes quite a bit different, not wanting this other man to leave. Aaron actually drugs his drink and answers Josef's phone. He learns that this guy isn't exactly who he seems to be. Also he can't find his car keys. This is just the beginning of the nightmare for Aaron.That is where I'm going to leave my recap for this movie as that gets you up to speed. What works here for me is the believability of this found footage film, as that is what it is. Aaron answers an ad and it seems easy enough. Josef seems off, but that could just be he is socially awkward. It is sweet and sad with the reason for hiring Aaron. It becomes a nightmare though when he keeps pressuring Aaron to stay. In reality, it still isn't, but we see little things that are cracks in Josef's story that change things.The character of Josef is where I want to delve a bit more and flesh out some of the things stated there. Like I've said, the reason to hire Aaron makes sense. He comes off at first like a weird guy. He keeps scaring him with different things. Part of this is that Aaron is on edge due to how things start off. It all makes sense for the reality. It is when he cracks the initials and shows him to this heart shaped rock it gets awkward. We then have things like Josef stating the diner they are going to have great pancakes, but when they're there, he doesn't seem to know the menu. Whenever get something like this, there is a logical explanation that disarms Aaron. It gets darker though when Josef tells a story about wearing the Peachfuzz mask and what he does with his wife to save their marriage. Josef is unreliable so we don't know what the truth is and what is a lie.This movie though wouldn't work without good acting. I think both performances here are on point. Aaron is our rational person. He is us. Being that this is a horror movie, we are seeing it and thinking why would you do these things? In reality, he doesn't know he is a horror movie. I've been pressured into things I don't want to do, because I see similarities between myself and Aaron. Brice does well in conveying that. The best performance though is Duplass. He plays this role of Josef so well. I feel bad for him at first and then more you get to know; the more uneasy he makes you. It is great to see where the character ends up.Then the last thing to go into would be the cinematography, effects and soundtrack. For the former, this is found footage and it works. It makes me feel like I'm right there with them. I do think there are times that some things are filmed that don't make sense. I can be forgiving here though as Aaron is a videographer and I wouldn't be surprised if they film some of this stuff by nature. There isn't a lot in the way of effects, but this is a psychological film. What we get looks good. I also wanted to commend the soundtrack as this is the sounds you would hear in the world. It adds to the sense of realism.So then in conclusion here, this is a solid film overall to me. I like that we have these two characters that feel real. We get to see someone like Josef who presents as one person, but the more we get to see; the more we realize it is a façade. I think that the acting brings them to life. The cinematography, effects and soundtrack all add to the sense of realism as well. For me, this is an above average movie and one that works on just an interesting level.My Rating: 7.5 out of 10.",Creep
23,framptonhollis,Excellent Horror Film,8,17 October 2015,"This is really one of the best horror films of recent memory. It keeps itself very clever and interesting throughout, and I was really surprised how much I ended up loving this movie! Of course, I expected it to be pretty good, but I did not expect to be so GREAT! It really is an excellent horror film, and the trailers just didn't give it justice, so, if you thought it looked really bad based entirely on the trailers, trust me, it is really good!The film is actually surprisingly funny! It starts off as a dark comedy, before turning to actual horror. Much of the comedy has to do with the absurdity of the antagonist (played by filmmaker/actor Mark Duplass). I mean, the guy awkwardly hugs our protagonist (played by the director, himself, Patrick Brice) when he first meets him. I don't know but, I highly doubt that some of these sequences are supposed to be taken 100% seriously.The movie also mocks found footage horror movies on some occasions, while still being an actual, successful found footage horror film. The main character makes some really idiotic decisions which the film actually kind of points out in its own clever way. It is a really, really smart film!But it isn't all fun and games, as I said it STARTS off as a comedy, but it dissolves into a horror film (even though there are still a few good laughs here and there). Mark Duplass' character seems to become less enjoyably absurd and awkward as creepy and a true sociopath. He is truly a disturbed individual, and one of the best and scariest parts of this movie!I really did not expect the movie to genuinely scare me like it ended up doing! It gets pretty disturbing on a more emotional level, rather than having bad jump scares (there are jump scares here and there, but they seem to be more for comedic purposes) and overly shaky camera movements to get some cheap scares, ""Creep"" is scariest when it has a disturbing silence to it.A truly great horror film.",Creep

Well after I watching I'd say the film wasn't all that great. I mean, there was some creepy things going on, I myself was tensing up every time the camera turned a corner or suddenly turned around & the guy Josef himself was a deranged creep with very & I mean very eccentric ways, but the premise just seemed a bit weak. There was not a bit of gore in the film, especially at the end, which I think was justifiable to have some gore in it. I also couldn't help but find the victims decisions to be completely dumb & dangerous! I mean, someone's after you why not disappear? Not to mention the part at the end, *Spoiler Alert* when he got out the car after agreeing to meet with him at the park, with his back turned, to the guy with the creepy wolf mask, who, like a ninja, crept up behind him & axed him to death right on the top of the head! Surely he would've heard the guy behind him, right? Pfft. No, of course not...Not to mention the unrealistically of the police not being helpful! The guy giving Josef the address to his house & of course him remaining in that said house & making the dumb decision to meet the creepy git! Damn!Like I said, the jump scares were good & the tension was there. But the villain getting away with it, was just a dumb cliché! It was alright to watch & better than than 1999's Blair Witch film, but this one could've been better.3/10",Creep

Then things get out of control.Looks like simple found footage, but the two psychological types and their relationship ring true, so this two-hander is well played and ends up with a tight climax. I can understand people complaining about the bad decisions, but they felt right for that character.The jump scares are just that - literal jump scares. And the actor playing the baddie varies his mood nicely. I saw him in The Lazarus Effect, but here he really shows his chops. Movies on this theme I usually find depressing, but this has clarity to it and, although the pace drags a little, it's enjoyable to watch.

26,gedikreverdi,It's creepy indeed,7,21 January 2021,"Aaron the charming guy showed up at the house at the top of the hill for the job and he was a weird guy. He said he's cancer and going to die in three months and wanted him to videotape his life so that his soon to be born son will be able to watch him. The bathtub scene was really creepy to watch and then the wolf mask. They went for a hike in the woods to see a heart shaped pool carved naturally in a rock by a waterfall. While they're having their pancakes it was really disturbing how he raped his wife (his sister in reality) with his wolf mask on because he found out in the computer that she's into animal porn and they both acted like nothing happened. They got back creepy house at the top of the hill, Aaron wanted to go but he wanted to commemorate the day with whiskey. Aaron being scared drugged his whiskey and they did bottom up. He fell asleep and his wife and in fact his sister called him and said to Aaron to exit the house because his brother had problems. After their scruffle the camera turned off and it was Aaron again telling he got back home and had his car towed. But he sent packages to his house which means he knew his address. He sent videos of him and a heart locket and inside were there the photos of the two and their initials were caved on the outside of the locket. I felt sorry for him after watching his last video telling how sad and lonely he's and wanted to meet him by the lake in public. Aaron came to the spot and waited him sitting on the bench facing the lake and Josef approached him from behind and killed him with an axe like Aaron confessed he's scared of the axe in front of the house when Josef asked if he thought he'd kill him with it. And then he said Aaron was his favorite because he was innocent. He was on the phone with another person for the job and he opened the cabinet containing his video tape collection with the names of the victims on them and the latest being Aaron with a heart drawn under his name. Josef's creepy murderous wolf love for Aaron was really disturbing to watch and the ending was too abrupt and shocking when he hit the axe in right in his head. I'll definitely watch the sequel soon although I am no so into found footage horror and I guess it kind of changed with this film.",Creep
27,meddlecore,"Worst Found Footage, Bruno Dumont Wannabe, Piece Of Crap Ever.",3,29 October 2016,"OK, so let's talk about Creep.First off, this film is just bad. I simply do not see what the hell other people see in this cheap, found footage, Bruno Dumont wannabe piece of crap. I mean, if you are going to go and emulate Dumont...why would you significantly lowball him. It just doesn't make sense.Perhaps, it was because I had randomly watched Wolf Creek, a couple days prior to this, that I hated it so much. I was actually expecting that Wolf Creek would play out more like this film...only to be blown away by it's extreme violence; realistic gore; and how long McLean was able to keep the shock-fest going for.The main characters in both films have over the top personalities- which are borderline laughable. However, Wolf Creek manages to win you over with it's extreme shock value and realistic special effects; whereas this film is neither creepy- nor tension-filled- is completely void of any gore/special effects, and totally fails to shock you for even the slightest moment.Basically, it fails in every facet where Wolf Creek shines. And seems to be a budget ripoff of it, at that.This film is wholly reliant upon cheap scares (think, a guy hiding around a corner, before jumping out in front of you and going ""AHHH!!!""). That is literally all this film has going for it.Nothing else happens in it, except for the ongoing stupidity of an unlikable hipster; and a few misplaced incest jokes.You end up sitting through the whole thing, expecting that something- ANYTHING- shocking will occur. But nothing ever comes to fruition. Something does, eventually, happen. But it so mild and unsatisfying...that it just makes you want to punch the director in the face.Personally, I was more disturbed by the fact that people actually found this film to be ""creepy"", than I was by anything presented in the actual film.Seriously, are there that many people in this world, who are so psychologically weak...that they were driven to anxiety or forcibly terrified by such a paltry ""horror"" offering?Cause that is some sh*t to be scared about...the future of humanity is grim...3 out of 10.",Creep

This creep is delightfully creepy, to the point that one gets that feeling of being embarrassed for the guy until his creepiness snaps back into normal, or almost normal. I also dig the strange setup for the ffing: the video for his unborn child. The story is that our hero, a struggling videographer answers an ad for a cameraman to shoot a film as a one-man crew.

This confirms to me that Mark Duplass is a phenomenal actor, as he puts in an excellent performance that was both engaging and off-the-charts creepy.And the filming locations - where was this filmed?! I need to go there and bask in the beautiful scenery, while trying to forget the disturbing film I saw one time that was filmed there.It was definitely a unique take on the hand-held camera horror movies and that uniqueness kept me on the edge of my seat.

31,dfa120374,"Dumb, Unbelievable, And Ridiculous",3,25 July 2016,"This is one of those films where it's very hard for me to fathom out how anyone could have thought it was really any good let alone enjoyable. I know everyone has their own ideas on what a good movie is and that not everyone shares the same opinion on films, but it's baffling to think how anyone could watch this rubbish and be entertained.The original idea for the movie isn't altogether that bad...a man answers a Craig's List advert (although that in itself should instantly set alarm bells going off) to document someone's story for a day for a substantial amount of money, but the man turns out to be some sort of psycho. Unfortunately the idea of the story is the only decent part of the film because everything else - including the film's execution - is pretty much ridiculous. Yes, people will (and can) do things for the sake of money, especially if it's only to be for one day, but as the events unfold throughout the day there is desperation for money and then there's just plain ignorance to what is happening.There are moments when you can actually forgive Aaron for being ""stupid"" at the start because of the advert & the story that Josef has led him to believe and you can actually give him the benefit of the doubt for those first few times. However, as the film wear's on, his actions become less forgivable because most people in that same situation would surely have been getting more & more agitated as well as suspicious about what is really happening, and they would have thought about getting the Hell out of that situation.Just when you don't think it could get any worse, we reach the ending. Not only is it totally unbelievable to think that anyone would do what Aaron did, but it takes naivety to a whole new level. I know people can be stupid in horror films, but this does take the biscuit.While there is the odd tense moment here and there, Creep is generally not really worth giving the time of day to.

33,SquigglyCrunch,A Very Different Horror Movie,7,16 May 2016,"Creep follows a cameraman, Aaron, who goes to film another man, Josef, for a day who has been diagnosed with brain cancer. Josef wants his unborn son to see the film so that he will have an idea of who his father was before he died. The plot doesn't really sound like that of a horror movie. It sounds more like a weird feel-good movie or something. And the majority of it isn't really all that scary. It's very different, actually. It's kind of creepy, and it takes time to build up the characters more than it does the horror. It's an interesting way of going about it, and it pulls it off pretty well. The characters are pretty good mostly. The main character, Aaron, is actually pretty relatable. Josef is also pretty well developed. He isn't very relatable or normal, but that's part of his character and he still feels like a real enough person. The movie is very good at throwing the audience for a loop and being unpredictable. I never had any idea what was going to happen next, but I wasn't really thinking about it either. I wasn't sitting in suspense and wondering what was going to happen next. Still, it wasn't predictable which is always a good thing in horror movies. I didn't really like the length of the movie. The idea wasn't necessarily spread thin, but there just wasn't much to it. It was a movie that just kind of happened, and I probably won't think about it much afterwards. That's not to say it's lower in quality, it's just forgettable. Overall Creep is pretty good. It's different, it's unpredictable, it's well-paced and the characters are good, but it's too short and forgettable, nor is it really scary/creepy enough. In the end I would recommend this movie, just don't expect to be terrified or anything.",Creep
34,phenomynouss,the joker (2014),9,18 April 2020,"The actor, Mark Duplass, is essentially creating an acting reel here. The film is highly minimalistic, taking the form of him as Josef hiring a videographer, Aaron, to film video for him to leave for his unborn child as he (claims) he is dying of brain cancer and may not live to see them grow up.
Over the course of the filming, he has a magnificent way of just subtly escalating himself, never overly drawing too much attention to the fact that he is a liar and everything he says is a lie. Everything he talks about and discusses circles back to talking about himself in some way, which would not seem unusual except for the fact that, as Aaron occasionally reminds him, this is not a film for and about him, this is (allegedly) a film for his unborn child.
It's all choreographed, as if it's not his first time opening up to someone else. The levels of discomfort and inappropriateness come in fits and spurts, which he easily tamps down as just his own oddball mannerisms. If you didn't already know this was a horror film, or if this were someone real, you would be easily deceived.
As for the film, some of it lags a bit, especially towards the end, and the actor/writer/director playing Aaron, Patrick Brice, is at best, functional, playing the Straight Man for Duplass to bounce off of.
Ultimately, it's exactly what the title says it is. It's a guy that is a creep. And when the climax of the film comes, the creep Josef has perfected a balance of discomfort all throughout the film to leave just enough reasonable doubt to make you question whether this guy is serious or just in a perpetual joke.",Creep

37,nitzanhavoc,"I'm not a fan of Found Footage, and the story here is far for impressive, but Mark Duplass's charcter and acting make this a truely terrifying film.",7,5 July 2018,"Let me start off by saying I am not at all a fan of the Found Footage sub-genre, or any other cinematographic project which is shot in first person view. The only reason I've decided to give Creep a try was that I ran out of Netflix English-speaking Horror and I like foreign films even less (nothing racist, heavens forbid, I simply find them more difficult to follow due to the sheer dependency on subtitles). That being said, I'm quite glad I did try out Creep, as it has some very memorable moments and features.First of all, the cast, by which I of course mean Mark Duplass as the creepy and unnerving Joseph. Some actors simply have certain physical and exterior features that when used right make them perfect for certain typecasts. Duplass is absolutely unforgettable as the neurotic and disturbed creep-type, always keeping you on the borderline between pity and sheer terror.The story itself is nice, though too full of holes for my liking (the ending in particular, which was completely unconvincing and forced, you'll know what I mean when you reach it). However, unlike most Found Footage films, Creep uses very little ""camera effects"" and does so delicately enough to not steal focus from the actual film. Add to that Duplass's amazing acting and on-the-spot role and you get a film that is scary enough to be enjoyed even by those who, like myself, prefer to avoid this sub-genre.All in all, I'd say this film is a must-watch for fans of the sub-genre and possibly rewarding enough for other Horror fans. My relatively high rating is absolutely due to Duplass, I can't stress enough how perfect he was for this part and how amazingly fitting his acting was.",Creep

If he was smart, he would have left a long time ago but he's either stupid or he needs the money (or both). To be honest, it was interesting in the beginning but the vast majority of their day was mostly boring. Creepy cause it's obvious that the guy is a creep but not scary. By the end of the day, I was really looking forward for something interesting to happen but all I saw were stupid decisions made by the filmmaker. First at the cabin and later in his own house. His response to an obviously scary and dangerous stalker is ridiculous. How dumb are you? As a found footage independent film, it's not the worst but as a horror movie it's also not great. I love horror movies that are plausible and scary. This one is plausible but definitely not scary! Although, I highly doubt a guy like that can kill so many people and not get caught plus, if he pays them a 1000 dollars for a day, he must be very rich.

He bounds on and off screen constantly, a blinding sunshine grin on his face and an effervescent attitude that consistently contradicts his supposedly dire diagnosis.As Aaron films Josef, he finds his subject's behavior more and more bizarre (the insanity of the pedophilic-overtoned bathtub scene sets the tone beautifully) until the videographer is merely hoping to leave Josef's cabin with a pulse. The film works precisely due to both actor's enthusiasm and the unnerving sense that literally anything could happen at any time (and often does).And Duplass has got to be the only actor out there who can make gyrating against a door in a wolf's mask both threatening and hysterically funny.Creep is a fresh, all-too-brief and wild ride that you'll not soon forget and even though the ending is a bit clichéd by now (we've seen it in this type of film hundreds of times before), Duplass' enthusiasm and mania make it seem eerily real.",Creep

Mark Duplass does a great job of making the dialogue and facial expressions creepy, yet so believable. His character is almost unnerving in how it seems like the everyday guy you see at the grocery store. Also Patrick Brice as the one who answers the ad for a single day job of videotaping this guy for a $1000 bucks does a really good job with adapting to the strangeness of what is going on. Oh, and since those two also wrote this, I am sure it kind of flowed for them as to what they were thinking as they wrote the story. Get used to those two, they are the only characters in the movie (minus a female voice on the phone). Yet they carried out the story well.

It's about an eccentric man who hires another man to videotape his story. From the first second the story is unhinged, which gives an eerie feeling to the interviewer, but also to the audience. How crazy is the lead actor? Or how dangerous? Where will it go? Or is he just weird?While watching the feeling grew onto us that this amateurish feeling was intentional. The movie grew into a psychological thriller that turned out to be improvised. Everything was minimalistic, based on a simple setting, few props and mostly conversations and facial expressions. The movie is viewed through the eyes of the interviewer who is also the cameraman (hand cam). His feelings are your feelings and it will take a while for the watcher to realize that what starts as weird, turned into terrifying and claustrophobic.The amateurish setting and acting are a blend of improvisation, perfect timing (which is the main ingredient of horror and comedy) and great hidden skill.

50,jackgdemoss,Terrifying in the most realistic sense,9,2 September 2018,"I see now that critics appreciated this film just as much as I did, but I had NO IDEA what I was getting into by selecting a random horror movie I had never heard of on Netflix. Creep takes every little broken piece of horror, polishes it up, and pastes it together into a beautiful and unique masterpiece. It is extremely disturbing and unsettling without once resorting to gore, which was a breath of fresh air. Be warned that the jump scares are severe but cheesy, but for good reason. Horror fans absolutely must see Creep.",Creep
51,baywoodarborist,Uncomfortable,6,11 July 2020,"Yeah, I couldn't give it a higher rating than 6 but there were some interesting ideas here.

I think they get you invested well enough in the character to stay with it. Good performance by the creep.",Creep
52,aprilsfriendorin,Weird and creepy documentary style movie,6,16 October 2018,"I've never been a fan of documentary style movies, but this is probably one of the better ones I've seen. Like the title, it will definitely creep you out. The movie is filled with uncomfortable and awkward moments that will creep you out in a psychological way, and I guarantee you'll groan at the main character's stupidity on more than one occasion. If you like horror/thriller movies and you can't decide what to watch, I'd recommend giving it a shot.",Creep
53,KoolCatReviews,Creep will make you cringe and then creep you out,7,9 April 2020,The movie is shot entirely from the view of Aaron's camera meaning we get plently of the handheld camera shots despite that the camera isn't too shakey and is in mostly good positions. A couple of clever editing techniques are used to get the best from film. With such a close film there is plently of time to build up character profiles. Josef's character had me feeling very cringy and unsettled. The horror does pick up later in the piece. A clever movie that builds up the tension mostly through our imaginations and other than some poor character decisions makes the story believable.,Creep

55,FKDZ,Frustratingly Naïve,3,8 August 2021,"I could just not place myself in this movie. The videographer seemed like incredibly fake. Like he was subdued by monotonous boredom.Mark Duplass is the best part of this movie, he gives an entertaining performance. But the script sits poorly with me.First off I'd say I was expecting a very different movie. Not as in your face as this one is. More mystery and tension like if someone is following you a.k.a. A creep. It's not like that most of the time.The creep, I found not disturbing enough. It's acted well. But it misses this off-putting edge, or maybe he has just a bit too much charisma.A main annoyance as well were the frequent, loud, and blatant predictable jump scares. I seemed like the movie relied on it just to keep you kind of tense. Without the jumps. A big part of the movie would be incredibly dull. Just nothing struck me that much, the creep has weird moments, but doesn't have a weird vibe... if that makes sense. In some films you notice when something is just not right with someone, how they walk, move their body, etc. But here the divide is too great between normal and psycho.Also, I'm not sure this movie benefitted that much from it being a found footage style of directing, a lot of the times I questioned why the person was filming. Even though its found footage, the style of directing contains a bunch of irrational close up zooms so we can't see anything and get jump scared easily.The protagonist..if you can call it that... is just a complete ''bleh''.. I can't even put it into words, but he's so incredibly boring and dull and doesn't seem to have a rational thought left in his brain. The entire world feels like its populated by just 2 people. There's no ''outside thinking''.The ending was probably the biggest letdown for me, I'd had hoped for something smarter.Sadly... I expected a bit more from this 3/10.",Creep
56,WubsTheFadger,Creep,7,21 January 2018,"Short and Simple Review by WubsTheFadgerThe story is fluid and graceful. The film keeps a sense of mystery and darkness that helps keep it tense. The beginning of the film is a little slow but it builds up to a great finale.The acting is okay. Patrick Brice and Mark Duplass both play their parts well.The pacing in the beginning is a little slow but then it picks up soon after. The runtime is short and sweet which is nice.Pros: Good story full of mystery and tension, great finale, okay acting, and a short runtimeCons: Slow pacing in the beginning, weak beginning story, and the acting can seem a little weakOverall Rating: 7.4",Creep

58,HorrorFan1984,Creep,8,29 June 2021,"Aaron agrees to follow and videotape the daily life of a strange and seemingly deranged man named Josef. He will soon realize that Josef is more than just a Creep...A videographer named Aaron agrees to film the last messages of a dying man after reviewing an ad in the paper. The man named Josef tells a tale of how h is a cancer survivor, but there is sadly a tumour the size of a baseball in his head that will kill him in a matter of months. As they film the life of Josef, Aaron realizes that Josef isn't necessarily the person he says he is. For example, they film scenes in the woods and Josef plans various jump scare moments to terrify Aaron.After Josef tells Aaron of a story where he raped his wife in an animalistic way, Aaron starts to get freaked out and motions to leave the cabin and Josef. After leaving, Aaron is plagued by nightmares of Josef and potential interactions with him. Eventually, he gets a box delivered to his home which contains a knife and a DVD disc. On the disc its Josef speaking to Aaron pretty much telling him to dig deeper into the box he sent him. When he does, he finds a locket with his picture in it. Aaron freaks out because the guy knows where he lives. Will Aaron survive this creepy stalker?I found Creep to be so uniquely interesting in the horror genre. Mark Duplass who played Josef (aka the creep) was amazing as the insane and needy Josef. The most intense parts of Creep was when Aaron went back home and was being stalked by Josef in his own house. There are so many scenes with Josef that make the viewer wonder if he wants to kill Aaron or has planned to kill Aaron from the start. When they are wandering through the woods alone, Josef asked Aaron ""When you first drove up and saw an axe sticking into a wooden stump ... was there a part of you that thought i would kill you with that axe?"". It was that kind of dialogue that terrified me as the audience. Also, as a POV type of film, there were a lot of jump scares that freaked me out. Aaron would angle his camera in one direction at one point, and the quickly pan over to Josef standing there creepily in another.Overall, Creep is a horror movie that should be seen by all fans of the genre. It made me jolt without any loud noises. The camera work by director and actor Patrick Bryce was extremely well done and built a ton of tension for the viewer. There was a realistic tone to the film which made it very frightening.8/10.",Creep

62,TheMovieDoctorful,Unlike Anything You've Ever Seen Before,8,6 September 2016,"""Creep"" is one of the most difficult movies to review because it's just so unique. The film only has two actors, (Patrick Brice and Mark Duplass, who also wrote and directed the film), no script and hardly even meets feature length at 1 hour and 17 minutes. The best thing I can say about ""Creep"" is that it's one of the most inspiring movies a young filmmaker can see. It proves that even with a minuscule budget and almost pathetically limited resources, with the right actors and writers, you can still make an incredibly disturbing, well acted and above all enthralling thriller. It's no ""Blair Witch Project"" but it's a damn impressive psychological horror any found footage fan needs to add to their watchlist.One thing I loved about ""Creep"" was its villain. The villain of creep isn't a sadistic demon or a ferocious werewolf or a towering, undead serial killer. Simply put, he's a very sad, very lonely and very sick man. Josef frightens and unsettles us, but as the film goes on, he tugs at our heartstrings, becoming a much more tragic and sympathetic figure. There is excellent symbolism in Josef's attachment to his wolf mask, fondly nicknamed ""Peachfuzz""; Josef himself is very much an animal inside who dreams of being a man. Of finding companionship. Friendship. Love. In many ways, it is the human appearance of Josef that is the real disguise, whereas the wolf ""Peachfuzz"" is his true self. While he tries to be human, to be loving and kind to his new friend Aaron, he ultimately has no idea what being ""human"" means, his primal nature and rage ultimately winning out. His character arc from genuinely sweet friend to violent, deranged stalker is as emotionally compelling as it is scary.The pacing of the film is excellent, it never stops being entertaining. The film can be funny, frightening, emotional and sometimes even all three at once. It doesn't waste its short 1 hour and 17 minute run time and there isn't a minute where it doesn't have your undivided attention.With only two actors, ""Creep"" must either sink or swim on their talent. Mark Duplass and Patrick Brice might as well be Michael Phelps. Brice nails Aaron's empathy and initial ""Good Samaritan"" attitude around Josef as well as his more (rightfully) paranoid and terrified demeanor later on. Duplass gives one of the best found footage performances I've seen as Josef; he's funny, he's tragic, he's terrifying, he's conflicted, he's unstable. Josef is a very complex character requiring an actor with extreme emotional range, but Mark Duplass more than fits the bill. He's particularly effective and chilling in the film's final scene. I must say that the film does tend to overuse jump scares. A LOT. Don't get me wrong, I have NOTHING against jump scares if used properly, in moderation and for a purpose. The problem is that the jump scares in ""Creep"" are the WORST kind; the harmless, ""trick"" jump scares. This is when you have something built up as frightening, we wait 3-7 seconds, and it turns out to be Josef harmlessly jumping out at Aaron to joke around with him. For such an intelligent and disturbing horror character study, they felt extremely out of place and childish and truly took me out of the film.This is much shorter than any of my other reviews but...What else can I really say? ""Creep"" is a phenomenally acted, well paced horror movie with a fascinating and investing villain and some unfortunate jump scares. Definitely worth a rent at least if you like found footage.",Creep
63,evans-j34,Boring!!!,2,5 August 2020,I liked the British film from 2004 called creep but this one with the same Title buy Netflix is absolute boring . I'd avoided it since I've had Netflix as I had a feeling it would be low grade. The only reason I gave it a chance is cause it's been given decent score review though I was worried on reading them oh no I wont like it as I realized it was a hand held follow me cam type film which I hate. The victim was a good actor and get the moral story at end but it was just boring & no way would I be that unsuspecting deciding to again go meet a wacko out of pity. I wont waste my time with the second one. Also when he phoned the cops just because he didnt know the guys last name doesnt matter he had his face on video to hand in. Really dont know how this got the score it did,Creep
64,MattBirk,A Redeeming Third Act,5,1 July 2015,"It felt like the makers of Creep were worried that people wouldn't find Josef creepy enough unless they forced a ton of creepy jabs down our throats. Instead, they chose the subtly of a bat to the face to get the point across that Josef is someone that is not right in the head. We can obviously tell very early on that something is off with Josef and we must then wait till the final act of the movie to see how it plays out. When instead they should have made it slightly less obvious and made the viewer question what truly is going on with Josef. That's not to say it was a complete failure, it wasn't, Josef is flat out manipulating and clearly hiding something sinister, and most of the time it works. And it really isn't until the final 1/3 of the movie that things start the get actually tense and unnerving. But the lead up to the bizarre ending was a bit tedious for me.I imagine the movie will be a minor hit with horror fans because of the plausibility of the premise, which is in fact quite scary. It's so simplistic that it could totally work, even if Josef seemed a bit out there. And that's probably why so many people will find Creep entertaining. And if you manage to sit through the first and second chapters of the movie, you will be rewarded with a pretty strange ending. The final third of the film really is the saving grace of the movie.",Creep
65,mungflesh,"Simple, clever and plenty of fun",8,26 August 2014,"If we contrast this movie with its great grand-pappy, Blair Witch, we see just how far the found footage genre has come, which is surprising, considering that around the time of Blair Witch, it didn't really feel like there was a lot of mileage in that particular sub genre.For me, Creep's greatest strength is the black humor. It's a seriously funny movie but never loses the tension that simmers under its surface. We've seen this kind of stalker idea many times before in conventional cinema of the nineties, such as Hand that Rocks the Cradle, The Fan and Cable Guy but this one really puts the viewer in the shoes of the one who is stalked.Mark Duplass puts in a legendary performance as Josef. The first time we see him on screen, it's kind of hard to imagine him as the Creep he is meant to be but as the movie draws to its conclusion, he nails it.It practically has ""cult classic"" stamped all over it.",Creep
66,Mara-Jade-Skywalker-23,Crap,1,28 November 2019,"When I planned on watching ""Creep"", I had great expectations for this film. I love found footage horror when it's done right; after all, ""The Blair Witch Project"", ""Lake Mungo"" and ""REC"" are three of my favorite horror films. And going into ""Creep"", I expected to be adding it to the list. The premise of a man accidently coming into the house of a psychopath or ""creep"" intrigued me, and found footage would be great for that. But my question now is: what went wrong?Well, for one thing, this movie features what are possibly the dumbest horror movie character. Patrick Brice stars as the main protagonist, Aaron. And while the performance is not terrible, the writing on part of Brice is certainly not good; because even though character makes dumb decision after dumb decision: it doesn't compare to the ending of the film, where after a chaotic night, Aaron decides to give Joseph (the creep) a second chance. And of course, he gets murdered, all because he's an idiot.Another point is that the film is simply not scary, Mark Duplass as the film's antagonist isn't scary. His performance is more along of trying to scary by making faces to the camera. And speaking of that, the movie mostly jump scares, and the attempts at psychological horror only come across as hilariously bad. And even though the film is just 78 minutes, it's never riveting. I'm either boggled at the stupidity of the character, annoyed at the constant jump scares, or yelling at the screen.So why this has an 89% on Rotten Tomatoes? Honestly, I'm not sure. Credit where credit's due, the film is shot well enough. The acting is not necessarily terrible. And the directing from Patrick Brice is probably competent part of this film. But as much as I love visuals and directing, the writing is far too much of a travesty to forgive.If you like ""Creep"", I don't care. But to me, this film is just plain old crap.",Creep
67,thelastblogontheleft,Mark Duplass Delivers Again,8,27 November 2016,"Oh man. I loved this movie so much. I'll admit that I will watch anything with Mark Duplass's name on it, whether he is acting or directing (he was not only one of two main characters in this movie but he helped write it with his co-star, Patrick Brice, and they improvised a large portion of the movie as well, which makes it extra impressive).Mark Duplass, for me, was instantly likable in this movie. You know the movie is going to take some kind of dark turn, but you honestly expect it will be anything but him — he is so open, warm, and genuine. There are some pretty funny moments that aren't really particularly humorous but you can't help but laugh at his raw enthusiasm. Honestly, I know he was intended to be the main character, but I thought Brice's role was weak in comparison. He had his moments, for sure, but overall he was forgettable next to Duplass.You start getting hints of Duplass's character, Josef, being a bit off almost immediately, and you want to just ignore it at first — tell yourself he's just an eccentric, rich dude — until you absolutely can't anymore. His unraveling is pretty disturbing to witness — with some serious second-hand embarrassment and uncomfortability at times — and he has some truly creepy moments (him guarding the door with the Peachfuzz mask on comes to mind, with his slow nod at the end *shudder*).Once Aaron (Brice's character) escapes, we then get to experience some pretty impressive dread and more second-hand awfulness as we watch him be stalked by Josef ooof. The thought of someone creeping around the outside of my house, peeking in the windows, keeping track of what I'm doing always SO unnerving. Josef then preys on Aaron's obvious humanity and compassion for a pretty shocking ending, and hearing Josef talking to the camera afterwards is chilling, to be honest.Ultimately, like I said, I loved it. It was technically a ""found footage"" style movie, but I feel like you don't notice it as much as you do with others since there's a) no running through the woods at night with the camera bouncing and falling, and b) no moments of ""dude you're fighting for your life WHY ARE YOU STILL FILMING). And, as I've mentioned before, I enjoy the style so no complaints there. The pacing was great, the story was simple but effective, and I can't say enough about Duplass's character being so simultaneously relatable and yet terrifying. A+ all around.",Creep
68,lovintennis,Clever but with stupid decisions,4,11 August 2017,"The story does a good job to realistically have the victim be creeped out by the killer from his odd story early on but why would you cave in to being invited back in to the house for a drink before you go on your way?

69,thisseatofmars,"Slow burn, cold twist.",7,19 October 2015,"Part of what makes ""Creep"" work is the creepiness of its lead, played by Cajun native Mark Duplass. Maybe it's his hooded eyes, lank hair, or Leno chin (maybe not that last one) but I can't imagine seeing Duplass in another production without this film's title 'creeping' to mind. (See what I did there? Yeah.) This film is noteworthy for two reasons: one, it's genuinely creepy and doesn't overdo the found footage quality (a sin 2012's ""The Bay"" commits,) and two, for its minimal resources. ""Creep,"" features only two actors (excluding the 30-second scene with ""woman on phone"") and there are no special effects, CGI, or sweet potato pie.That said, many parts of ""Creep"" drag on and on, and there are a few too many jumpscares (and some of them are Duplass himself literally hiding behind a corner and jumping out at the camera. Cheap!) Pacing issues aside, ""Creep"" is apparently the first of a trilogy, and I'm looking forward to the release of its sequels.",Creep

As they day goes on, Josef's behavior gets stranger and very uncomfortable.Unfortunately, this film had good potential and it had worked perfectly as a short in a anthology film, sadly in the half part of the movie all went down hill. I hate it when this happens as a good idea goes to waist.There are many ways of how this could have been solved,but we ended up with very moronic characters. But it's still fairly entertaining specially Duplass, he is honestly the best of this movie,he can create a dark but funny character at the same time.I do not understand why the character of Patrick Brice insisted on heeding Josef,anyone with common sense would do anything to be isolated from a person like Josef, i mean the amount of red flags Josef gives him is enough to run away, seeking his family and addressing authorities.

A character needs to en up in trouble by accident, or perhaps some lack of rational judgment, but if the character is a complete moron, then we don't care what happens to him.In this film, the character that gets in trouble is precisely the kind of moron I am talking about. He sticks around despite the fact that the random guy he met is acting like a mental patient. He proceeds to act like a moron to the very end of the film. And the villain is just too weird to be interesting. We have no clue what motivates him, we can't make sense of anything he does, and ultimately we end up being irritated because we feel we are being mistreated by the screenwriter who deliberately throws nonsense at us and provides no payoff for our investment in the film. At the end of the day, this is just random nonsense that does indeed get creepy at times, but never amounts to an enjoyable viewing experience.",Creep

The camera guy keeps making dumb decisions, and you'll be yelling at the screen for him to do the logical thing, but he doesn't. It's too far fetched to be plausible at all, and any normal person would be able to get out of the situation much easier.In the end it I found it more frustrating than frightening, which is a shame because the premise had good potential to be really creepy.If you want a good Duplass movie, watch Safety Not Guaranteed instead.",Creep
74,Krackoon,Nice Little Thriller.,7,27 June 2015,"'Creep' may start off a little slow for some hardcore horror fans, but it's a nice little gem of a film. It's more of a thriller than horror film, though.Going into the film, I knew it would only go as far as Mark Duplass took it, but surprisingly, the story managed to hold my interest. This isn't something you should expect from most horror films, so you should enjoy the very few horror films that manage to accomplish this feat. 'Creep' also managed to keep me guessing - I expected the usual 'Last Horror Film' storyline, where the killer simply wanted an accomplice/witness to his madness - which still would have been acceptable, but I am more than satisfied with the direction they took. It's a nice change of pace.Random Ramblings of a Madman: It's a slow burn, with a nice payoff. Mark Duplass's villain should be considered one of the more frightening, due to his innocence, trustworthiness, and likability. A horror film it's really not - unless you consider 'Fatal Attraction' a horror film. And if I knew Glenn Close were attracted to me, I'd certainly be horrified.",Creep

Mark Duplass is a blast to watch, playing so perfectly the charismatic psycho, making you keep till the end. The weirdness of his character helped to create some tense moments throught the film, especially those with Peachfuzz.
But, as almost any other films of the genre, Creep falls in the obvious clichés: stupid jumpscares (they seriously don't make any sense), the character keeps filming when he shouldn't, etc. And my complaints don't end there. Unlike Mark Duplass, Patrick Brice (also the director) just can't act, his character is extremely unbelievable because he makes the most odd decisions.

The only thing I knew about Creep was that it had a really good rotten tomatoes rating. I didn't read a plot synopsis, didn't know the cast, directed or really anything about this movie. I like watching movies like this because then I don't have any expectations going in. Creep, directed by Patrick Brice and starring Mark Duplass, follows Aaron who answers a sketchy craigslist ad for a one-day job to shoot a film. His client is a little weird and talkative, but Aaron realizes this man is not who he seems. It sounds generic and overdone, but Creep executes its premise in an original and memorable way. This guy, Josef, seems like a pretty normal guy. He's not a shady, mustachioed guy who drives a windowless white van, but he's also not ""too nice"" or ""too perfect."" Josef is just the guy in line behind you at McDonald's who's way too talkative and kinda aggravating. Paired with a standout performance by Mark Duplass makes him an incredibly memorable villain. The plot itself is also wildly unpredictable, which is far too uncommon in movies like this. You never know where this movie will go or what will happen next. It has so many tricks up its sleeve that it'll keep you on the edge of your seat, anticipating the next move that the movie will make. Creep is without a doubt one of the best found footage films in a long time, and it may be one of the best horror films of the year.",Creep
81,jmerlino,A Hell of a Performance,9,17 August 2020,"This movie is the ""My Dinner with Andre"" of horror.I saw this movie several weeks ago, and have been turning it over in my mind ever since. To me, that's something that makes a horror movie great.Are there plot holes? Sure. Are there parts that are a little implausible? You bet! But who cares when you've got Mark Duplass using his impeccable comedic timing to produce something that's darker than comedy, but wittier than most horror?Duplass carries this movie. No, strike that. Duplass IS this movie. His performance is the only thing that makes anything scary, and it works. His delivery. His mood shifts. His erratic behavior. All of it combines to create an air of menace without actually doing much of anything violent or such that you're not sure if he's really a bad guy or not. By the end, I had more or less concluded that he was, to the point where I found the closing scene somewhat anticlimactic, and I think it's supposed to be that way.This is a movie that subverts most horror expectations. The murder isn't scary. The victim isn't particularly sympathetic (Aaron is okay, but not an especially memorable character.) The jump scares are more comical than truly scary (though still startling) . All of the horror, all of the suspense comes from whether or not Josef is truly capable of doing what we IMAGINE he's going to do. Is he the serial killer we suspect, because this a horror movie and we expect things like serial killers, or is he just a weird eccentric with a penchant for freaking people out?By the time you're reasonably sure that he is, in fact, the bad guy, it almost doesn't matter any more.

In fact, Paranormal Activity is the ONLY good one out there. This movie was based on improv conversations and it shows. It is slow and doesn't build up. It is predictable and boring. It offers nothing to keep you scared (there are a few jump scares which I view as cheating anyway) My advice to the makers of this movie: write a good story instead of improv. You have to trick the audience. In this movie we knew who the ""creep"" was the entire time. There are a a couple small little twists, but they don't really make a difference in the story. The ""Peachfuzz"" mask is the scariest thing in this movie.",Creep

We watched it because it had a 6.2 rating. Reviewers don't seem to allow much room for really good movies when they continue to give mediocre films such high reviews. This movie was painful to watch and we realized this within about ten minutes. We wanted to see how it ended because of all the implications that there were twists. The first big problem is that there is no build up of suspense. The creep starts out immediately as a weirdo who made me feel uneasy. He was difficult to listen to. Both of us viewing this wanted to escape from him, but saw it through to the end. I don't understand reviewers who say he started as a nice guy. There were red flags all over the place that he was an oddball. I also don't understand the reviewers who are indicating that there is some kind of twist and that the movie doesn't go where you think it is going. It goes exactly where you think it is going. The cameraman is a person who doesn't listen to that inner voice warning him. Even though he isn't stupid, he can't bring himself to get out of Dodge when he has a good opportunity. He also tries to be compassionate at the end. This just wasn't a very good movie. It isn't because it's found footage that I didn't like it. It's because the story is poorly done. I stopped the movie several times to see how much longer it would go on. Always a bad sign! I like a good thriller or horror movie, but this gave me an uncomfortable feeling rather than scaring me. I couldn't wait to stop listening to the creep.",Creep

With limited, and accessible locales and only two actors, the filmmakers rely heavily on dialogue and plot. The dialogue seems to be true to the demographic that the movie's only two actors represent. But for my money, I just can't see one man being politely terrorized by another, especially someone easily a one foot shorter. I wanted to scream out to the videographer, ""man up""! But maybe that was part of the filmmaker's intent?Creep works for those who can relate to these characters, especially the wimpy videographer. For me, at the risk of sounding like an Internet tough guy, I would have given the little crazy dude sufficient incentive not to put on any wolf masks in my vicinity.

And it's not because the found- footage genre has run its course (I don't have a problem with F-F at all)It's one bad actor filming another bad actor, with a script that sounds like it's been written by a 17-year old film student. None of the ""twists"" seem to be in the slightest bit surprising. There's no real sense of dread emanating from the cartoonish villain. When the hero is warned to ""get out of the house"" you don't share his alarm. I'm not averse to a few jump- scares, but every one of these made me roll my eyes. Check out House of the Devil instead.

I nonchalantly decided I would throw on Creep thinking that it would be a campy Horror-Comedy ala Shaun, but instead what I got were the most aggressively uncomfortable minutes watching a film ever.The start of the film had me a bit bored and annoyed; rolling my eyes at the introduction we get with the 2 characters of the movie. At about 15 minutes in that annoyance transpired into confusion, 20 minutes I'm sentimental (wtf) and then 30 I'm paranoid, 40 minutes I'm literally sweating. The great thing about this film is that there is no exposition, the cameraman is a nice everyday guy that anybody could be or maybe was; slightly naive 20-something who is nice, financially challenged and needs cash, so the plot set up makes sense. What he says and how reacts to certain things that our ""creep"" does make sense. The dread builds cement being poored: thick and muddy and gets heavier as it falls. Oh my lord, they managed to make a post-modern art deco house look like a jungle gym for psychopaths. The little gestures and mindgames that Josef does to Aaron are super bonechilling; it's to the point where he gets himself into Aaron's head and has dreams about him. Trust me when I say this is heavy stuff; I LOVE horror movies and this really violated my sense of safety for a few days.

Although not a super scary film by any means, it was still unsettling and nerve racking. When Aaron was outside his house looking for Josef I couldn't help but to put my hands in front of my eyes and peak through. The best thing is nothing happened, the film is just creepy It doesn't try to do anything but creep you out and keep you on the edge of your set. Although creep is not perfect it still holds up as a very good film. If you are someone who wants their thrillers and horror films to have a bunch of unexpected twist and turns, this is not for you.

I mean, really, we are almost in 2016 and image stabilization is embedded on your toaster, so movie directors everywhere get the friggin grip already! Thankfully, this time we are only going to be bothered by it for a short few minutes at the beginning and here and there during the rest of the movie. So, if you are like me and hate shaky video just endure the first minutes because you are in for a great ride.The movie has two main characters, and that's all that is needed to make it work. And you already know from the synopsis that something fishy is going on. I don't usually do spoilers and I won't this time, but from the first minute you start watching this feature you are waiting for something to happen. Good enough, because what matters on this movie is not what happens but the ride to arrive to that expected destination.And what a ride that is! You will be scared (cliche way and otherwise, you'll see), you will feel that someone is weird, and you will smile and maybe laugh. You will get feelings for the characters, and you will arrive at the expected destination enjoying the ride.I fully recommend this movie for what it is: Good simple entertainment.",Creep
102,HorrorFreak1997,"frightening and hilarious, with an unspeakable amount of tension",9,13 September 2016,"Creep (2014) also known as Peachfuzz is directed by Patrick Brice and is a modern cult classic. it's a found footage film about a videographer named Aaron (director Patrick Brice) who responds to an add on craigslist for a one day job in a remote mountain town. upon arrival he becomes acquainted with our villain Josef played by Mark Duplass. Josef requests for Aaron to film him before he passes away from cancer so that his unborn son will have something to remember him by. eventually the relationship between the two men becomes more and more unsettling. things are revealed to not be as they seemed and Josef begins progressing into a very assertive and creepy person.the found footage aspect is used in an effective and plausible way. we get plenty of tension filled and unsettling scenes where the found footage style is used masterfully to really put us into the shoes of our main character and allows us to feel the fear that he feels. the director Patrick Brice's portrayal of Aaron does the film justice but isn't exactly standout. we do get a good sense of his vulnerability and willingness to help Josef even after some things become extremely creepy and weird. the real star of the film is of course Mark Duplass. his portrayal of Josef is nothing short of legendary. extremely chilling and convincing, he goes from weird and creepy assertive behaviour to being genuinely sincere and sometimes funny.the film does a great job of balancing humorous moments, excellent jump scares, seriously dark scenes of dialogue between the two characters and moments of suspense and tension. a potent and wonderful mix for a film with a tiny cast and a presumably small budget. Brice is not afraid to keep things simple and this movies thrives on simplicity. most of the film is just scenes of dialogue between these two men and it works so well in terms of building a realistic and believable story that the audience can be immersed in.this is one of the best found footage horror films of all time. as well as one of the best horror movies of all time, period. well worth the watch. it's been made public that this is the first film of a trilogy.

I don't understand why they still make movies like this where there is a dumb person with a video camera who self shoots their own death after a series of repeated mistakes. It's very unrealistic and predictable at this point. It is made in the same mold as Blair Witch, V/H/S, Devils Pass etc. except in this one, there is one guy with a camera recording everything at a psychopath's house. The psychopath, Mark Duplass, who i think is much better suited for comedy was exactly as the title says: He was very creepy. The film relies on shock horror, lots of scenes where things jump out at you. The opening scene, a college aged guy who drives a crap yellow car shows up at a cabin near a lake supposedly because he was informed of a film job there. The first 25 or so minutes of the movie we find out that Duplass' character, Josef has cancer and needs to make a video for his unborn son (wife is pregnant) before he dies of cancer. The bath scene was particularly disturbing. Aaron, the video taper, sees soon that this guy is not right mentally but he goes on ahead anyways (like they always do). There were several times where Josef purposely ran off and scared Aaron when he tried to find him. Soon we find out that the whole thing was a lie, he doesn't have a wife and doesn't have cancer. Aaron ends up escaping creepy Josef's cabin and makes it back to his house where conveniently he starts to get stalked by the creep. After finally calling the police to report Josef, Aaron realizes that he knows nothing about the stalker except for his first name(The cabin turned out to be just a rental). Josef breaks into Aaron's house and drops off a DVD near Aaron's bed (while Aaron is sleeping of course) that is a video of Josef trying to apologize for his behavior. In the video, Josef begs Aaron to come meet him so they can talk about their situation. So, in the most predictable ending ever, Aaron the idiot goes and sits on a bench where they were supposed to meet. Josef proceeds to sneak up behind him wearing a mask and chop him in the head with an axe, the same axe from the opening scene.3.5/10 I feel the same way about this movie as i do about most of the ""found footage"" films. They just don't work. Yeah, it's creepy and a few jump out of seat heart pounding scares but that's only because the main character was so dumb in the first place, this would never happen in real life and for me i like horror movies to be realistic so i can actually feel scared and can relate to it.

130,movieswithmitch,Creeps proves train hasn't quite left the found footage station just yet.,7,27 March 2014,"The found footage horror genre feels like a train that should have left the station a long time ago but sticks around waiting to see who else they can cram on board so they can squeeze a couple more bucks out of. Well, I'm glad that train stuck around to let ""Creep"" in, proving the genre isn't quite out of steam yet.It's not so much the found footage aspect that makes ""Creep"" successful but the creative infusion of the mumblecore genre that breathes some life and/or scary death into the film. ""Creep"" is a two-hander that is co-written and co-acted by Patrick Brice (who also serves as director) and mumblecore king Mark Duplass. Brice and Duplass are able to funnel the mumblecore's priority of character development and use of a more natural dialogue, or in this case, a very naturally unnerving dialogue, into the staples of a Jason Blum (Paranormal Activity) produced horror film. The combination of these three's efforts make for one, well, creepy film. Brice plays Aaron, a normal guy looking to make a little extra cash when he answers a craigslist ad that will pay him $1,000 for a days work to videotape a day in the life of Josef, played by Duplass. The shoot has Aaron driving to Josef's family cabin at a remote mountain town where instantly both we the audience and Aaron feel things aren't right. Josef greets Aaron with a loud sneaky surprise hello, and then, foregoing a handshake, straight to a stranger hug. That last sentence pretty much captures the film experience as you go back and forth from shocking jump scares and very unsettling interactions between the vulnerable Aaron and the assertively goofy Josef.Kudos to Mark Duplass for creating a character that is thoroughly terrifying but relatable enough and more importantly sympathetic enough to believably keep Aaron in a situation that just gets weirder and dangerously weirder. Scenes that include a naked bathing Josef giving a mimed bath to his unborn son, which he calls ""tubby time"", will long stay in my memory banks under the title 'frightening'. ""Creep"" excels by shifting gears from hilarious, to sad, to scary, to sometimes all of that at the same time. And to each their own, in the SXSW Q & A after the screening Duplass said it was great to watch as some of the audience would laugh at one part but others in the audience would wince in terror.While Duplass and Brice heaped praises on horror guru Blum, saying they helped them achieve effectiveness in a genre they've never attempted, I still had my qualms. The jump scares become all too repetitive hitting a mathematical equation that Duplass said Blum taught them. ""One jump scare every 10 minutes to keep them in the mood."" Another one of my horror pet peeves is when the holder of the hand held camera in a found footage film only see's what the lense sees. So when in an open room and the camera moves left so does the character's vision which results to something surprising them by jumping out to us on screen when all that character has to do is move their own head back and forth to keep informed on what's around them (thanks for letting me rant).The end which I won't get into has a few moments of 'you should have called the cops so much sooner', but that can't take away from intense ominous vibe that permeates. I dug ""Creep"", it's a film that is greatly helped by a very good actor who taps into his inner creep and gets under your skin.""This"" gets under your skin.1 Timothy 4:1",Creep

It's starts off innocently enough, and the plot is easy to follow. Then we meet Josef, who right away seems a little off-kilter, but I couldn't put my finger on why until later. As the plot moves on, I felt like I'd ventured into the dark side of YouTube, when you're looking for something normal and you end up stumbling upon all kinds of crazy stuff.

132,markusibbetson,Won't give you the creeps,2,12 August 2020,"This 'found footage' film is a waste of your time. Nothing happens for the majority of this film, leading up to an anticlimatic end.
One random dude pays another random dude to film him for the day and makes up BS stories about his life (he's dying of cancer, he's making a film for his unborn son, he put on a wolf mask and raped his wife). He develops and obssession with the guy filming him and briefly turns into a stalker, before luring the camera man out and burying an axe in his head.
Films done on hand held camera are getting very tired and this film adds absolutely nothing to the genre. In fact Creep being a 'found footage' film is almost entirely unnecessary and doesn't help the film in any way.
The characters in this film are two dimensional and woefully underdeveloped. The camera man spends 80% of the film behind the camera (obviously) and we learn practically nothing about the man, so it's hard to care about him. The guy being filmed makes up so much crap that we don't know what to believe. Near the end he sends one last video to his new 'BFF', where he admits he has problems and doesn't know how to deal with them, therapy doesn't seem to work and he claims he just needs someone to talk to. This is done in an attempt to make us feel sorry for him, but the ending to the film undoes this as it's revealed he actually enjoys being a stalker/murderer.
This film is a slow burner which fizzles out at the end. The stalker part of the film is too short and poorly done, making the whole film feel a bit pointless.
The stalker says he really cares about his camera man, but there is very little to make us care about this film.",Creep

135,Kubricksboy,Creepy? Yes. Horrifying? Not That Much.,7,13 August 2015,"Creep, Patrick Brice stellar first of the many to come is a found footage horror film, a film among the ranks of The Blair Witch Project in the genre. Creep celebrates the cardinal pleasures of a psychopath which are mostly stalking and murdering people.A mentally dysfunctional man (Joseph) hires a a man trying to make money(Aaron) through Craig list to document the last days of his life for his soon to be born son, or so he says to gain Aaron's sympathy. As the day progresses Aaron gradually discovers things Joseph through the bizarre conversations they have. Night falls and Aaron out of caution decides to leave, but he is forced to stay and in the hours which seemed endless to Aaron he finds out that Joseph is not at all what he initially seems. Aaron in light of the new findings desperately tries to leave the house against Joseph's will (this will, I think, is the reason he was named creep). After a while, when Aaron was trying to forget all that had happened to him he gets stalked by the Creep, stalked to unimaginable lengths.Patrick Brice who had both directed and acted in Creep does a fitting job in both the fields, the found footage cinematography makes the film seem realistic and real with a story like Creep would definitely have an immense effect on the audience, the Film also does not provide any background score since it needs none and that only adds to the realistic vibe which the film is already well endowed with. Mark Duplass who plays the Creep justifies his role in every possible way. He initially acts like a tumor-fighting father and as time flies he shows his true colors.

136,Dar_Sargent,Feels like a high school project,1,29 December 2019,"I went in hopeful for this movie. The bare-bones approach of just having 2 actors who mostly chitchat was promising; I figured this movie would be about compelling characters who build suspense without any fancy gimmicks. I was only right about one thing: instead of fancy gimmicks, this film uses lazy, zero-effort gimmicks.The story is simple: an amateur filmmaker is hired to tape a home movie of a weird guy named Josef. Josef claims that he has cancer and wants this movie to be a memento for his son, but it's obvious from the get-go that he's lying & has something to hide. It could've been a fine setup for a psychological tale about an interesting character.But instead, Josef isn't a character. He's just a vehicle for random ""crazy"" antics that feel like something from a youtube skit made by teenagers. He does idiotic things like putting on a wolf mask and growling while rubbing his butt against a door, or telling a lame ""Creative Writing 101"" story about his wife's sexual deviancy, or stealing a lock of the filmmaker's hair while he's asleep. It's the kind of thing that every wacky ""creepy"" character does in a lame comedy, except here it's actually played straight. In the second half of the film especially, he turns into a generic ""creepy gay stalker"" like something out of Family Guy. He also does lots and LOTS of cringe-inducing, meaningless """"""clever"""""" monologues, and they all sound like they were written by sheltered college freshmen who watch too much TV.This film is honestly really pathetic, because it's like someone tried to make a horror movie based on postmodern horror references in pop culture, instead of learning from actual horror films. I can't believe so many reviewers actually call this movie scary and ""deep."" Do all these people live under a rock? If you've viewed any media from the past twenty years, then this movie is just a third-rate imitation of things you've seen before.The other character, the filmmaker, really isn't a character at all. He's a boring nobody who's just there so Josef can screw around with him. That's right: the creators were so lazy, they could only create one gimmicky half-character, so our ""hero"" has exactly zero personality traits.Don't believe any of the hype you hear about this lazy time-waster. If you like cliches and unoriginal things with no subtlety, you'll enjoy this movie. The only good thing I can say about it is that it's mercifully short, at a little over 70 minutes.",Creep

I wouldn't say the movie is ""scary"" but they dialed up the creep factor to 11! The premise for this movie is very believable and it works excellently for a found footage film. The premise is a simple one. A struggling videographer answers an ambiguous add to film someone for a day at their cabin for $1000. When he meets his subject the guy seems a kinda weird but harmless. As the day progresses his subject's behavior gets increasingly odd. After a long and very awkward day of filming they head back to the cabin and have a few drinks at the subject's insistence. And it's at this point that his behavior goes from weird to seriously unhinged. That is act 1. Plenty of great stuff follows and it's not just some dude getting getting chased through the woods and shaky footage. This movie is way smarter than that.There are only 2 people in the movie. Both of the actors are brilliant and totally believable. The character's actions are clear and make sense, albeit one of them is insane. What I really enjoyed about this movie and what sets it apart from 99% of all other found footage films is that it is entirely plausible. I definitely recommend this movie!",Creep

It's a combination of horror, drama, and comedy that is so tightly wound that you never know what to expect from one moment to the next. The idea is simple: Responding to a Craigslist ad that sought a videographer for a one-day job, an unassuming man named Aaron (Patrick Brice) drives to rural California to film a dying man's final video message to his wife and as-of-yet unborn child. At least, that is why he believes he is taking the job. The real reason he was hired, was for reasons unknown, until the climatic ending of the film. There are multiple reasons why I enjoyed this movie, but one stood out more than the others; and that was the acting. Mark Duplass stars as the ""creep"" so to speak, and his performance gives me the creeps. As for Patrick Brice, he played a very convincing victim of the events that take place. Another thing this movie does very well, it manages to maintain its mysterious and surreal feel, but at the same time actually delivers laughs. It's not a comedy, but has a black comedy feel to it. Running under 80 minutes, which is clearly not a problem for the movie.

146,joyomi,Scary stalker,8,18 September 2016,"Creep is a entertaining horror with a manipulative stalker named ""Josef"". The movie is about a man named Aaron who picked up a job of filming Josef's day on Craiglist. We can tell that Josef is not all the way their mentally, and is way to clingy to Aaron, who soon becomes scared of Josef's weird manners. The Peachfuzz scene is actually pretty creepy, and there are a lot of jump scares in the movie. The actor who plays Josef is very good at conveying a insane stalker, and is unnerving to watch. I would say their is some dumb logic that Aaron uses that does not make a lot of sense, he is very gullible and passive. The movie definitely is creepy though, and Josef's story about raping his ""wife"" in the Peachfuzz mask is disturbing. The isolated house also adds to the atmosphere, and the camera work makes it feel like this could be real. I would recommend Creep to horror fans, the only negative in my opinion would be Aaron's reactions to some of the staking incidents, but still a very enjoyable movie.",Creep

151,furtherdownfilms,Creep - A special kind of found footage.,7,21 July 2015,"Creep - 2014 A Movie Review by Nathan FischerCreep is quite the little gem in a sea of found footage horror films. The acting is superb, the scares are effective, and the antagonist is truly creepy. I just wish the pacing was a little smoother. Its the simplest of plots. A free lance videographer(Aaron) gets a job to go film a man(Josef) in his everyday life for 8 hours for $1000.00. The strait forward plot is the films strongest aspect. You learn about both of these guys along the way, and they have a bizarre chemistry between them. Josef is a creep. That is no mystery right off the bat. But what kept me hooked was watching him try to contain his creepiness, but at the same time, slowly let is seep out. Mark Duplass plays Josef in a role that is deep, confusing, and real. You don't see many performances like this in found footage films. Aaron is played by Patrick Brice, who happens to be the writer and director of the film. His character has a little less to work with but he plays the part well. I wasn't always convinced that his actions in certain situations were believable. I mean, there are red flags all over the place and he still sticks with the guy. They do incorporate his trusting personality and nice guy attitude in to his actions. He's just a guy that feels bad for Josef and wants to give him the benefit of the doubt. The situation twists and turns through the whole film, and there are some genuine scares and creepy moments throughout. Although I was fine with the ending, I felt like it could have been more. But the suspense is so delightfully intense and the performances are so well fleshed out, that the pacing can be forgiven. This is a top notch found footage film that truly made my skin crawl.

All footage is shaky HAND HELD CAMERA. Probably 2 or 3 days of filming and an additional day of editing to put this together and sync in the audio.

166,leominosa,Effective and frighteningly plausible,8,29 August 2014,"Employing found footage in a way that actually makes sense in the context of the plot, Creep is the story of an increasingly awkward relationship between two men that feels frighteningly plausible.The film rests upon – and succeeds because of – Mark Duplass' excellent performance as the type of person we've all met at one time or another; someone a little bit too keen to be your friend, inspiring conflicting feelings of suspicion as to their motives and empathy with regard to their ill-judged attempts at social interaction. Seen through the eyes (or rather camera) of Aaron, the only other on-screen character (played by writer/director Patrick Brice), it's clear fairly early on that something isn't quite right, but should he be worried?Despite an occasional reliance on cynical jump scares (presumably included to ensure that the tension doesn't sag – the film is dialogue-heavy) the suspense ebbs and flows nicely and keeps you guessing as to where it will end up going. Thankfully, for a film that always feels like it's building up to something, the resolution is well-judged and perfectly executed.Overall this is a very impressive effort and marks Patrick Brice out as a filmmaker to keep an eye on.",Creep

We never get to see serial killers in such an intimate way, and Duplass brings this person to life so perfectly I think someone should keep an eye on him. Literally he's so deeply creepy and credible in this role that if I ran into him at The Grove or something I might not even go up to him and gush about the series because he seems too real, too close to this character.

177,rainbowijij,"It is a creepy movie, but just not creepy enough.",6,21 May 2016,"A movie about a cameraman taking a job to film the last days of another man who claimed to have brain cancer. Things didn't happen in an usual way and the whole idea of the movie is about a crazy man creeping the hell out of the cameraman.I personally think this is a very nice movie. The filming style is not rare though, the topic and the story line is actually quite fresh to me. I thought it was a story about a crazy murderer at the first 30 mins of the movie but ever since Aaron went back home things got exciting. I have no idea what would be going on next, it is good in a horror movie that audience cannot guess what is coming.I especially like how they build the character of Josef. He is a liar of course, but what is he lying about and what is he lying for? He covers a lie with another one, that is interesting because I couldn't stop thinking: what the hell does he want? The creepiest thing of this movie to me is that I couldn't figure out what does Josef want, when and how does he want it.The whole idea and the first half of the movie before Aaron went home was good. However the creeps in Aaron's home aren't being helpful. For example Josef creeps in and cut Aaron's hair, this may show he has an obsession with Aaron but it is not that creepy to me. It may also show that he is crazy but we all know that already! The tension of the creep built in Aaron's home is not enough, I would say it is going down. Sending video tapes and weird gifts in doesn't really creep the audiences out.But I do like the ending, especially the last video from Josef. I really believed him he was just a pathetic sick person. (I was yelling to the screen to tell Aaron don't go though. :P) I still have some questions in my mind, is Josef a psychopath or he is just a smart liar who likes to kill? I mean, is he really crazy? From his collection of the tapes of the people he killed, it seems like everything is planned... He doesn't seem like to have mental problem...It's a good movie after all, but I just think some of the creepy details are not creepy enough and they might be useless in helping to build the tension.",Creep
178,kejbra,Interesting and unpredictable,8,18 June 2016,"7,5 stars out of 10 (No spoilers). I enjoyed this movie and I liked how it was kind of short, like the older classic horror movie. I also really like how this movie is filmed and put together, it could have been filmed at any given time without changing the main plot. this movie could have been filmed in the 30's and instead of communicating by film they could communicate by letters. The movie is also very time less, it does not make any references to modern way of living, pop culture or brands, which means people watching this movie in 50 years will have no problem understanding it. Less is more in this case, and the idea behind this movie is also great. This movie touches on the purest basics of human psychology and ways of reaction, like being afraid, angry, lonely etc. There is no hocus pocus explanations for things in this movie, and the reactions are believable.The title of this movie is creep, and the title fits this movie perfect. I love the creativity, simplicity and style of this movie. However, the ending could have been a little better, though what happened is not unbelievable.This movie is interesting and unpredictable, its worth the time and it may be one of those movies that outlives many other more known horror movies. I even believe this movie may be better than other fresh horror movies being made these days like ""It follows"" and ""Hush"", time will tell.Watch this movie!",Creep

But, the moment Josef is introduced, we know that he has some sort of ulterior motive.The performance of Mark Duplass as Josef and director Patrick Brice as Aaron is outstanding and excel in a scene halfway through the movie, which I won't spoil but it's so incredibly disturbing that I could barely sleep that night.

195,DoomsdayDevice,"An unexpected yet inspiring gem, a better introduction to Mark Duplass as a filmmaker.",9,20 February 2020,"I had first seen this movie while sifting through the un-ending cavalcade of low budgeted and uninspired horror films on Netflix. I read the description and saw the rating which was less than favorable. I thought ""Wow, looks like another nothing movie!"". So naturally, with these kinds of films, my mind was drawn to it like an unfortunate soul who suffers from Stockholm's syndrome is drawn to a former abuser until I had finally decided to watch it not too long after.Fully expecting a schlocky, low effort found footage film, I was very pleasantly surprised when it turned out to be a weird indirect character study of a man with mental health issues. This film catches most of its audience off guard with either how good it really is, or how uncomfortable it may make you feel at any given moment without justice nor warning. After many viewings of this movie this is the conclusion I have come to:Creep is a subtle and unsettling tale of an unfortunately all to real story that may be more likely to actually happen in society today.This subtlety is very well done only in the way that an experienced filmmaker like Mark Duplass can conjure. From the beginning of the movie, nothing is screaming ""THIS IS EXPOSITION PAY ATTENTION TO THIS"" or ""THIS WILL BE REINCORPORATED LATER INTO THE FILM SO YOU BETTER LOOK AT IT NOW ARENT WE SO SMART?"" The little exposition we do get told at the beginning does not feel forced at all and in fact, it thickens the plot and re-enforces the characters motives.That, as well as wonderfully written lines like ""For a split second, when you saw that axe, did you think i was going to murder you with it?"" that gives off a very awkward yet unsettling tone complimented by the long silence before a response is given, things like this are wonderfully and meaningfully reincorporated later into the movie. This film handles itself nicely and is thankfully coherent all the way through.On top of the presentation of the film, this film also has a great script. When you have two people making a project start to finish like Mark and Patrick have done here, you can really make something amazing. You can smell the passion project aura this film gives off. Most of this is thanks to the script and the acting.The script for this movies features some of the best dialogue coming from Mark Duplass that I've ever seen. The dialogue is so well written that it gives characterization through Marks own words, but the script also gives great indirect characterization through marks actions. This makes for a well developed and likable antagonist. Unfortunately I cannot say the same for the protagonist.We dont know much about Patrick Brice's character other than that he's a videographer for hire.We get a bit of a deeper look into Patrick's character when the movie shifts location to his own house and thankfully it gives us a LITTLE more characterization but still not much. I cant really say i was ever rooting for him to escape the clutches of this psychopath because frankly hes just a cardboard man. When the antagonist is a million times more likable than your protagonist in your horror movie then it simply lowers the stakes and makes the climax less engaging.Before i wrap up, the ending to this movie did not shock me or leave me scared but, the scene had my stomach sinking the entire time with its eerie silence and ambiguity. Well played, Mark Duplass.All in all, this film flexes its muscles well. Its all wrapped up in a neat little bow of questionable validity. Thank god we have you, Mark Duplass.",Creep

200,street_trash,Creep (2014),8,2 June 2016,"(No spoilers)Creep (not to be mistaken with the 2004 horror with the same name, featuring a mash up of Gollum and Nosferatu) is a Blumhouse production and a found footage thriller from first time director Patrick Brice, that admirably serves its purpose in a swift running time of under 80 minutes. Yes, you heard me. A story in a film can successfully be told and an audience can be both entertained and chilled in that short amount of time, with no unnecessary fillers to make the movie longer. The term ""less is more"" is absolutely apparent in this film and it is executed brilliantly.The plot is incredibly simple. Brice plays Aaron, the man behind the camera who has answered an advert on Craigslist - $1,000 to drive up to a cabin in the woods in the middle of nowhere and follow Josef (Mark Duplass) around for the day and film him going about his day. Now, if you've seen more than 5 horror films in your life, you're probably thinking this sounds somewhat suspicious. And you wouldn't be wrong. Almost as soon as seemingly naive and carefree Aaron arrives to the cabin, Josef's aptly put ""creepy"" behaviour is evident from the get go. Josef goes on to explain some good and bad news - the good news is that his wife is expecting, however the bad news is he is dying of a terminal illness. The video footage Josef has requested Aaron film will later be viewed by his son as something his late father left behind. Initially it seems to be a heart-warming concept, however there's undoubtedly a lot more to it than that.As the plot moves on, Josef's behaviour continues to grow more erratic and the little humour in the film gets more unusual - you may find yourself laughing nervously at some scenes. And don't even get me started on Peachfuzz - I'll leave that to you to find out what I mean. For a film with only two people featuring in it (three if you count a very brief voice on the other end of a phone), it still remains refreshingly different and interesting. Aaron's character may aggravate you somewhat (or a lot - but hey, that's a horror film for you) throughout the film, with you constantly asking questions about his impractical actions (or lack of) - especially why on earth he trusted a total stranger's vague Craiglist's ad in the first place, however Duplass' enthusiasm and deranged performance make the entire thing seem eerily realistic. Having him stare at you into the camera while he's talking or generally acting bizarrely is sure to get to you feeling uneasy and to shy away from looking at the screen at times. Despite the occasional jump scare, this film is incredibly dialogue heavy, however don't be put off by that - the suspense flows nicely and keeps the viewer guessing what will happen next. The suspense continues to build up by the halfway mark of the film so much I personally was struggling to watch the film due to covering my face with my hand and peeking out of a gap in my fingers, also unable to shift the memory of the film later on.As previously mentioned, this is a relatively short film but with the strong combination of unbearable tension paired with sitting on the edge of your seat in fear, this will seem a lot longer than a mere 80 minutes. It goes to show that even with a small budget and very limited resources for a minimalistic film, an incredibly simple concept can be delivered and executed with precision. With the announcement of this being the first in a trilogy, I am excited to find out what lengths they will go to in the next installment. The deeply unnerving Creep is available to watch on Netflix - my suggestion would be to turn the lights out for this one - oh, and always be wary if you ever attempt to make a new friend again.",Creep
201,pablo-colangelo,Worth watching on a cold night alone at home,6,24 October 2015,"In my opinion this movie could have have a lot of potential if the budget was higher or maybe the script a little bit more revised. It's a movie made up from camera footage like Blair Witch Project. The format works well for this movie and a good thing about it is that it does not try to frighten the viewer with fast disgusting scenes or sudden increases of the volume. There's a lot of tension during the whole movie thanks to the excellent job of the main character, Joseph. It ranked it only 6 because I think that the beginning of the movie, the cabin part is a little bit long and boring. They should have exploited a little bit more the stalking.

He acts in such a way that reveals his intentions to the viewer in bold text. This could have been used perfectly to involve an incredible plot-twist. Instead, our beliefs at the beginning come true after the hour long wait.Aaron is brain-dead. Firstly, I would've dipped from the get-go: It's clear Josef is full of rubbish and he continuously asks creepy questions. The police phone call is very unrealistic as the evidence is very plausible. In this horror film the survival logic is nonsense.The axe to the head was brutally awesome but I could only concentrate on the fact that Aaron was dumb enough to not look around. Numerous parts of the film don't make sense to me. Somehow Josef gets film of his killing every time without being caught. His strategy for murdering the cameramen is awful. He had so many opportunities to kill Aaron and he keeps him on edge instead of tricking him into a false sense of safety. Maybe that's just because he is a psychopath but it's still annoying either way.This film relied on silly jump scares which were only scary a third of the time.

The tone is effective because you can bad feel things coming, yet they still manage to throw in good comedic relief at the same time.

And I look forward to the sequel.",Creep
206,NarcoNelly,Pretty Creepy,9,11 December 2015,"I wasn't originally intending to review this movie. I watched it one bored weeknight on Netflix about a month ago. When it was over, I didn't think too much about it. I thought it was a competent mumblecore-type found-footage film that suffers from many of the same weaknesses of movies in that general category. Why would he be filming right now? Why wouldn't Aaron just do x in this situation? Etc. etc.But I keep revisiting it in my mind, and certain scenes in particular. There is something insidious about this movie that is hard to articulate, and which sneaks up on me every once in a while when I am having a quiet moment alone in public in the middle of the day. This movie is a little different to me now that it has had time to marinate.This may be something that is very specific to me, but I once worked in criminal defense and in that capacity I dealt at length with many people who had serious mental health issues that were directly related to the heinous crimes they were accused of committing. I have spent endless hours talking to individuals who seem friendly and intelligent, though often a little odd, who I know are accused of slicing up someone's insides and burning the body, all in the name of banishing the devils or their mother. It is difficult to explain the feeling of observing a massive disconnect between someone's demeanor and the things that you know they have done. Killers with pronounced mental illness are not the way they are portrayed on television. But they are often similar to the way Josef's character is portrayed in this movie. Outwardly, seems quirky but friendly enough. You know (at a certain point) they have done something heinous, but it is easy to forget this when they fail to do anything unambiguously evil in your presence for a time. You empathize with them, and start to believe the things they say to you, before some tiny thing that's off in just the right way brings you crashing back to the weird reality that you are interacting with a person who has something inside them that you don't understand. It is not just Josef, however, that really ramps up the uneasy feeling I get from contemplating this movie. It's the entire structure. Found footage films that are low-budget and dialogue- heavy are more amenable to scattered plot lines that do not present the same linear progression typical of more polished or high-budget horror films. In Creep, stuff happens, then other stuff happens, then it ends in a really bizarre, almost serene way. There are very few questions that are definitively answered. Why did things happen the way they did? Why does Josef do what he does? I acknowledge the criticism from other reviewers that they feel left hanging with unanswered queries. And I am here to express that, at the end of the day, this frustration may be reflective of the unexpected experience of watching a movie that is much closer to the disorganized truth about being murdered than one might think. And that, my friends, is why this movie is capital-C Creepy. It's a bit of a slow burn, but worth it in the end. I believe, too, that this is intentional on the part of the filmmakers. I have seen plenty of movies that are similar on a superficial level, but where criticisms about cheap scares and weird scenes are a result of sloppiness or poor writing. I don't think that is the case here.",Creep
207,praybird,"My favorite ""found footage"" so far.",9,14 April 2016,"I watched it because the idea of Mark Duplass playing the part of The Creep got me really excited. I knew I was going to have fun watching Mark creeping the audience out. And the trailer gives you a hint that it's going to have some wicked disturbing sense of humor. I didn't expect the really scary ending. I found that ending great. It's well written. It's interesting to watch. It's psychological. The thing about the ""good guy"" Aaron ""stupidity"" is all over this board and people seem to be really angry about it. I can understand it. But this only speaks in favor of this little film, because people clearly were rooting for the guy and didn't want him to become the Creep's victim. But if you watch the film attentively and listen to everything that Josef says about Aaron or to him - you would understand - why Aaron is not leaving, when he should leave. It's easy to call a character ""stupid"" and just throw this word around, but only if think that films should be only about extremely smart people. Aaron is not the smartest guy in the room. He is also extremely lonesome and had a disturbing childhood. He has issues. He is victim by his nature. And The Creep sees it immediately. That is why Josef says ""Oh my god, oh my god. You have such a kind face. This is going to be amazing"". He says it because he sensed the victim and he is happy about it! And there is a psychological reason why certain people get themselves into trouble. This story is about that. This is the story about manipulation. It's very well written and disturbing and fun to watch. And Mark Duplass is hilarious and scary at the same time and, I want to see him playing more juicy parts like that.",Creep

210,martinhoffmann-21665,Did we all watch the same movie?,3,9 May 2020,"I just finished watching this movie and I was looking forward to find critics tearing it to shreds.
Apparently I must have watched a completely different movie because the horror masterpiece that most critics are describing has nothing to do with 'the creep'.
This movie has no twists at all, you can tell Josef is not mentally stable from pretty much the very beginning of the film, what's worse, Aaron, the guy hired to record the creep, has no survival instinct he's constantly getting himself into more danger. Instead of running away he stays in the house and looks for Josef. There's a point in the movie where Aaron gets a call from Joseph's sister, the sister asks him repeatedly where he is, yet Aaron apparently has no idea where the house is located even though he drove all the way up there.
There's a point later where Aaron hears strange noises coming from outside his house, keep in mind by this point in the movie he knows he's being stalked and followed by Joseph, still he decides to go outside and check on those sounds. It's not something a real human being would have done there's no logic to any of what Aaron does.
In a nutshell, this movie is really predictable, it has barely any tension and whatever tension it does have, this immediately lost because of all the cheap jump-scares they put in. I understand that to show that Joseph is quirky you make him jump once or twice in front of the camera, but he does this exact same thing about six times all throughout the movie and each passing time it gets more and more boring and predictable. I don't understand why people think this is some sort of masterpiece but it's just you to spend your time watching something more entertaining like paint drying.",Creep
211,Algerrish,Surprisingly Good,9,21 October 2016,"The found footage horror genre is trite in many aspects. Creep realizes the platform's potential, capitalizing on its intimacy and low-frills approach. With few scripted scenes, this entire movie feels entirely genuine, adding to the unsettling aura that Joseph projects. Aaron is off camera for the majority of the film, leaving the audience feeling very much as though this were a one man show. Whether you're looking for an independent aesthetic, or a good old- fashioned scare, Creep will deliver both. With an unmarked package with no return address.",Creep

214,harvey-devinhundredperce,An example of what found footage horror should be.,9,9 February 2017,"Creep is a subtle yet uncomfortable experience of a horror film, in the best way. Unlike other found footage there's little reliance on jump scares and gore and more of a building tension created through the conversation and actions of Mark Duplass' character. Some of his actions can seem harmless and yet hides an underlying creepiness which becomes more visible as the movie goes on. I was pleasantly surprised by the structure of this film and it will definitely keep your interest as long as you give it a chance. Best way to describe the feeling this movie emitted to me is a beginning of second hand embarrassment and uncomfortableness to pure creepiness and an unsettling atmosphere. Whether you're a fan of found footage or not, I believe you will love this, just don't expect many jump scares or much blood and gore.",Creep

I believe that had more charters had been introduced throughout the film it would of had a more surreal feel to it. Let me be clear on one thing, again, while this movie is awful, it is in fact creepy. The low rating is simply because of the lack of other characters and what appears to be some holes in the story line itself.",Creep

This movie perfectly parodies a bunch of cliches in horror and especially the found footage subgenre.I loved this movie and I am convinced that the vast majority of reviewers who hated it completely missed the point and looked at it very surface level.

It's very effective in terms of being unnerving and the acting is good throughout. There are some really creepy moments mixed in with some quite funny moments. The only negative was the slightly implausible ending, would you really go and meet Josef after what he had done to that point? I personally would have preferred the whole film to have stayed in the cabin rather than him escaping initially and going home. The tension had been built up well to that point and I think it would have worked better for it to have continued in the cabin during the night.Overall a good film 8/10",Creep

I was immediately intrigued by the fact that the craigslist responder was a legitimate cameraman: a simple and effective way to ensure the films quality aesthetic. The dynamic between Aaron and Josef is utterly fascinating. Especially if you're a people watcher. You fall in love with Josef's idiosyncratic persona, and you will remind yourself every 5 minutes that the cameraman is NOT Seth Rogen. Mesmerising performance from Mark Duplass (Who I'd only seen in The League which I'm not a major fan of) and sterling work from Patrick Brice.Very endearing film, had me enchanted and entirely freaked out at the same time.10/10 - FLAWLESS",Creep
230,kris-03204,Worth watching,6,4 November 2016,"Awkward. A simple and believable concept. We've probably all had a friend or associate that was a little odd, a little intense, a little socially inept. The plot starts off innocently enough. Aaron is an optimistic videographer that responds to an ad on craigslist to make a film for Josef. Suffering from a serious illness, Josef wants to make a video for his unborn child. Josef wants to demonstrate to his unborn 'buddy' what kind of person he really is. What a progression it is... Friendly, lighthearted, a little awkward, rather intense, very unsettling, extremely abnormal, somewhat terrifying... and then some. Certainly someone that lives up to the films title. The film always keeps you guessing where it's headed... There are several points you feel it's about to wind up and credits are set to roll before it reaches it's gripping conclusion.More jump-scares to keep you engaged rather than terrifying horror. Some moments that will make you laugh and cringe. Hardly a masterpiece, but worth a watch and perhaps a sequel that is apparently forthcoming.",Creep

Of coarse there were sometimes I thought Aaron made bad decisions and should have left while he could. But as stated in the film, Aaron was one special snowflake who always saw the best in people and who clearly needed the money (maybe a friend as well?). Creep is one of those horror movies you can't keep off your mind. And the ending is honestly one of the rawest, most genius endings I've ever seen.

From the beginning the cameraman is given strong hints that the Creep is false, unstable, untrustworthy or dangerous. The cameraman does not seem to possess any logic or survival instinct either. An example would be when he exits the bathroom to find that the drugged Joseph has left the place he was sleeping, he exits the building into the pitch black, unarmed, in an area that (he believes) Joseph knows particularly well. Logic would have him stay inside, armed, until it is light when he can make his escape with full visibility. He continues to use the camera to look around (I am aware it is a hand-held camera film but most of these have had some ounce of logic i.e. Blair Witch use of camera for light source) rather than defend himself. I won't elaborate on all the examples of failed logic but that is a sample. Overall would not recommend. There are greater horrors out there.",Creep

While there are a couple of 'creepy' moments, the film is neither subtle or clever enough to work the brand of queasy humour delivered in films like American Psycho.

Why didn't I continue watching the film after the 17 minutes line mark? I blew my load too early due to countless jumpscares. Like really, it got to the point where the killer had jumped in front of the camera (just for the sake of it) twice within three minutes. I´m sorry, but I just can´t pay attention to something as stupid as this. Jump scaring for horror is like tickling for laughs: it works if it´s mildly done, but it can get annoying pretty fast.

Creep is not boring, it is slow burning. It is not dull, it merely relies on more refined (and effective) techniques than jump scares.

I am not sure why I continued to watch it after a certain point(you will know when that is when it happens) but I guess morbid curiosity and time spent up to that point stand for something(although I stopped watching ""Shutter Island"" about 40 minutes in, glad that I had not paid to see it.) but then when the end came I just shook my head in disbelief. Their were a few ways they could have gone with this but chose the stupidest one they could come up with.

The ending was quite solid too, no music just the silence of death.Here are my criticisms though; the jumpscares personally ruined the movie for me. It made the movie feel cheap and at worst, obnoxious. I don't know if it was horror movie hyper-awareness or a personal disconnect but I found the protagnonist's decisions unrealistic, just 1 minute of the antagnosist's dialogue would've had me stepping on the gas to gtfo of there and I'm a shy, overcompensating person. I couldn't imagine anyone having so little intutition that they would stay in an extremely isolated cabin with a mega creepy guy that's constantly touching the subject of death and having literally no other presence in the house despite him claiming to have a wife. All the characters behaviour didn't feel realistic at all, it felt frustrating. If you don't mind all this feel free to watch but I won't be watching the second one. 5/10",Creep
262,lauren-37812,Suspenseful and psychological,8,16 June 2020,"I found Creep to be a very successful horror movie. Not for the few cheap jump-scares here and there, but for the suspenseful and unsettling tone. From the very first 5 minutes I was already hooked on watching it, which was a breath of fresh air as a lot of thrillers have a slow and boring beginning. The antagonist, Josef, was a multi-layered and overall disturbing, giving the movie both its title and an engrossing plot. The protagonist, Aaron, was relatable and likable (sometimes horror movie protagonists can be unlikable and you don't necessarily care too much about their wellbeing). Creep left me utterly unsettled and at the same time impressed that a movie like this doesn't need gore and paranormal activities to be terrifying. And best of all, Josef looks like a normal person (for about a minute or two), which makes it feel more realistic and paranoia-inducing because you feel like people like him do exist in real life and can look like everyone else, which is psychologically disturbing to say the least. Great film, good plot twist, and very riveting storyline. I definitely recommend it to people who love psychological thrillers or horror movies that don't contain blood and gore.",Creep
263,emilymiranda-15834,Don't waste your time,2,1 August 2020,"I've seen a lot of horror movies in my life, and this was by far one of the worst. It was weird and uncomfortable, yes. But a horror is scarier if the character does everything right and still meets their doom. When they walk into bad situations knowingly, it is just frustrating. The tension is contrived, annoying, and pointless because you know they are too dumb to survive anyway. I would rather watch the Kissing Booth than see this film again.",Creep

The plot thickens the further you go on and at the end it's just like ""no thanks"" but you watch the second one anyway.

If you lack the ability to suspend disbelief, this is not for you.

277,ashleigh-barr,Seriously pleasantly surprised at this hidden gem!,8,29 February 2016,"I found this on a well known streaming site and was drawn by the fact that the title and the accompanying images didn't match the film 'Creep' from back in 2004 which I saw when I was young and which has horrified me to the core to this day... I had a quick look at the movie description and came to IMDb to see what the reviews were from users (I find them more reliable to follow if trying to decide whether to watch something or not rather than reading critics reviews (unless the critic is Roger Ebert whose opinion I respect massively, although this film was released after he passed so I didn't bother looking at the critics reviews at all) The general consensus was good and although it was a home movie style film, I wanted to give it a go because people were saying it had something new and different. That it most certainly did. I was hooked from the moment it started and it had plenty of suspense and a huge sense of unease the whole time. I watched some of it from far across the room because I didn't want to be too close to the screen at the particularly tense moments, and there were plenty of them. The most refreshing part of this film is that the character holding the camera acts exactly as you would yourself in this situation. No walking around with no lights on shouting out into the darkness in this film, and therefore no need for me to shout at the screen in annoyance that the character is an airhead who thinks it's safe to walk around in the dark! Some say this is a sort of comedy- this I do not agree with, unless an awkward uneasy laugh that I found myself doing a couple of times counts at making this film a comedy... Excellent acting, good storyline, believable characters and if you are a horror fan, I think this is right up your street. I've recommended it to several people because it definitely shouldn't be missed and disappear into a horror film bargain bin!",Creep
278,thegraduate-336-305032,Almost great .... but not quite,8,10 January 2016,"I'm a fan of found footage movies - hell, one of my fave horrors of all time is Blair Witch. Unfortunately, the good ones are found only randomly: The Tunnel, Undocumented, The Sacrament..... and then there is CREEP, which is a modern day goody. Very simple idea: man is hired to film a random stranger for a day for $1000 - but things take a strange twist from the start, and just get darker as the film progresses. People complain CREEP is too slow, that it goes nowhere and is filled with plot holes. No, no, no - are people so much in a hurry nowadays that a movie needs to speed along at breakneck pace to be 'watchable'? The pace at which this film unfolds is what makes it work - the viewer gets time to notice things happening, the characters develop, and the feeling of unease builds - slow at first but gathers momentum as does the film. Whilst there are some blatant jump scares, there are some genuinely frightening moments as well which are nightmare inducing. The last 20 minutes are both tense and frustrating at the same time - but a good ending regardless. Well worth a watch for something old but told a different way.",Creep
279,ottodude555,Horror comedy in disguise,8,10 October 2015,"Easily the best thing about this film is the way it uses the cycle of tension and release. Specifically, it establishes the fact that yes, cheap jump scares will be used, but uses the process of establishing this to it's advantage. While many films establish the use of jump scares by boring fake-outs, ""Creep"" uses fake-outs as a joke- and makes it work! The release of tension from the jump scare, combined with Duplass's... Uh, interesting performance, makes a brand of humour I'd describe as almost cynical. Don't misunderstand, it's not a comedy, and if you go in expecting to laugh, you'll be disappointed, but if you go in expecting to never crack a grin, prepare to be pleasantly surprised. The best thing about it, is that it doesn't sacrifice scares for laughs. The tension's so high in certain scenes, you could literally pluck it like a guitar string and watch it vibrate. tl;dr: it's not the funniest movie in the world, and it's not the scariest movie, or the most thrilling, but it combines the three elements in a way I've never seen done before, and it's worth your time.",Creep

282,sparksp75,Creep is creepy.,8,23 June 2015,"I won't start by saying that Duplass did something unexpected with his character in this film, as he has always demonstrated a level of competency with his acting skills. This film just reiterates the point. The man portrays the deranged ""Joseph"" with a deftness akin to many of the greatest actors of all time. He is excellent at playing the cards close to the chest, and his unnerving performance will give viewers the willies. Many critics are so eager to dismiss any found footage type film as a dead-horse, however it is more a case of a filming style than a genre. This film demonstrates that the stylistic approach of found footage still has untapped potential to bring an interesting narrative to the table, served alongside horror's delicate, yet often and so easily botched, creepy vibe. I gave it 8/10 because it accomplished what it set out to do in the first place, which was creep me out. I wish the cameraman's character had been a little bit more intelligent and bold, hence the -2...however horror films very rarely provide characters that possess sufficient intelligence to navigate the traps of the antagonist to a degree where I, as the viewer, would agree with their decisions. That said, even the protagonist's mistakes are addressed, which certainly makes up for it.Well done, definitely worth a watch, and lives up to the title.",Creep

The movie was mostly predictable and there were like 2 cheap scares that were more stupid than anything.

284,intothechasm,Just another bad found footage film,3,9 September 2015,"At only 82 minutes long, it's surprising how much of a chore this movie was to watch. I saw this film on netflix and, while being skeptical, I thought it could possibly be an above average horror flick. Not anything groundbreaking, but still better than others. Sadly, what I didn't know before watching this film was that it was produced by Blumhouse. As Blumhouse is known for, this film is filled with a load of pointless jumpscares in order to 'scare its audience'. But, rather than scaring you, the jumpscares absolutely ruin the tension and are just used as a substitute for horrific ideas and visuals. Instead of having a slow build up and reveal of Mark Duplass's insane character and having it be three- dimensional, instead the atmosphere and tension are paper thin and every now and then it goes 'BOO!'. My main gripe with this film is Mark Duplass's character and how they try to slowly develop him over the course of the film but he just ends up being weird for the sake of being weird. While the movie makes it seem like he is supposed to be some sort of mysterious killer or something like that, his behavior just comes off as random rather than having some sort of purpose. He doesn't really have a personality, he is just whatever the script wants him to be at that point. The main character, while making some dumb decisions, is not as dumb as most horror movie protagonists. While I do not like this film at all, there were a few good things about the film. Some moments later in the film with the main character trying to escape the house are genuinely creepy. Also, there's a lot of potential to the story of this film, but it just falls flat on it's face. The setting is nice and while I respect the movie trying to just use one setting with only two characters, it came off to me at least that this was more to save money than to fulfill some artistic vision. Overall, I would recommend to stay away from this film. With bad writing and directing, no scares, and being boring as watching yarn for 82 minutes, this is most definitely typical found footage schlock.",Creep

I'm not a big fan of the ""documentary"" / reality style films and this one fails miserably. There is potential but it seems like the director ran out of money and just threw something together.

I loved the sense of comradery between Patrick and mark: I could tell they were two good friends that created this elaborate project together. I loved that it kept me wanting more as I knew something was going to come to an ""explosion"" but I enjoyed the ""ride"" along the way. It was brilliantly written and I love the simplicity in Patrick's acting. His acting was very simple but real and believable. Sometimes I think it's the hardest to play the simplest role.

Creep is a good movie for horror fans: it mocks the jumpscare aspect of common horror movies while it still manages to get you either way; it goes beyong the usual found footage, not killing its protagonista right after the violent cut on the video; it presents to us a serialç killer thats fairly interesting (and, as any good killer should, owns an alluring character and maintains a continuous sexual tension throughout the whole movie).

What makes it interesting is the fact that the killer isn't some vague, enigmatic character but is right in front of you through the whole movie. That being said you got to acknowledge that you never really get to know Josesp. Who is the guy really? Which of the things he tells Aaron are fiction and which are fact? The sublime portrayal by Mark Duplass of this complex and mysterious figure makes you hungry to learn the truth about this character. And you feel sorry for Aaron who tries to puncture this bubble.A significant turning moment in the movie is the phone call Aaron makes with Josefs sister. This is the only moment in the whole movie you are really sure you get to hear facts about the antagonist. After this moment the atmosphere changes drastically in a more dark one.The movie portrays the complexity of the interactions between two people who are are completely handed down to each other. Creep brings up emotions of anxiety and claustrophobia to his audience. You get a sharper look inside how it's got to be coping with a stalker who is completely obsessed with you and you can't get rid of.

305,omaha-41453,Creepy uncomfortable and Original - Not a horror movie,8,20 March 2018,"Ok so this movie in my opinion is a really good movie. (note i didn't say ""scary movie"") Now the reason i'm reviewing is because there were a lot of really good reviews and a lot of really negative reviews. So i'm here to hopefully show you both sides without giving any spoilers. I'll start with the bad:
If you don't like handheld camera movies then you wont like this movie because that is how the whole movie is filmed. If you don't like feeling uncomfortable or awkward then you wont like this movie. But honestly i don't like those things either but i loved this movie.If you are looking for a movie with twists at the end then this isn't your movie. If you are looking for a movie with demons, paranormal activity, ghosts, monsters, werewolves, vampires etc... then this is not your movie. This is just about a creepy guy. It is a straight forward movie that is supposed to make you feel uncomfortable. So the bad reviews I can tell are very very picky people when it comes to scary movies but as i said before don't go into this thinking of it as a scary movie. Think of it as a movie where if you were in that position you would be creeped out. Hence the title of the movie and first person point of view. I read a few reviews that complain that the first scene is too much of a close up on the guys face as he talks to the camera but i think what they are forgetting is that this is a movie about a guy using a handheld camera and i think the director wanted it to look more amateur than professional...obviously. So remember - this is meant to look amateurSome other reviews were upset that the main character had many opportunities to leave when it was getting too creepy but didn't. I actually laughed out loud at that only because isn't every person in horror movies usually an idiot? I mean what character has common sense in scary movies??? Ok so the good:
We normally watch scary movies because of suspense, jumpy scenes, twists, monsters and the thrill right? Well since this isn't a scary movie you get something a little different. I would say the reason i liked this movie is because it made me uncomfortable. I kept putting myself in the main characters shoes on what i would do or how i would handle these weird creepy things that goes on and it made it fun to watch at the same time of being so weirded out.When I say creepy by the way, i don't mean a cemetery at midnight or spiders. I mean creepy in Human form. We all know people can just be plain creepy. So picture a person you've crossed paths with before that has creeped you the eff out. Whether it was a stranger or someone you just got a really weird vibe from. Well that is this movie except the main character hangs out just a little bit longer than any of us normal people would and well i guess you'll see how much creepier they can get. I think this movie is super original. I was like all the people writing the negative reviews. I turned it on because i wanted to watch a jumpy horror movie. even though this wasn't the scariest movie ever - there still are jumpy parts, there is still the element of not knowing what is going to happen next, there definitely is a creep factor and the uncomfortable feeling you get while watching it. If you do decide to watch it - remember to watch it knowing it is meant to be amateur style filmed, not a horror movie, no twists, but is creepy, uncomfortable and original and i really think you will enjoy it!",Creep
306,aiaparishelena,Waste of time,1,24 September 2018,"Very poor acting and storyline. How in the world that this kind of film gone out in the public. It's not even worth a penny. It's like 2 social climber gradeschool kids trying to get an attention to the public. To the filmmaker and actor, please please stay away in the movie industry.",Creep
307,ashmitapd,"Well, that was something really creepy.",7,20 November 2018,"Enjoyed watching this movie, it's a short movie and with lots of creep jumps and suspense atmosphere. This movie creates tension and leave u with nightmare at the end. Watch it if u love horror and psychic movies.",Creep
308,jgittens-93831,STUPID,1,9 August 2018,"DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME !!!! This has to be the absolutely stupidest movie ever ! From the first 5 minutes to the end - Dear GOD .....an hour+ of our lives we'll ever get back. How in the Hell we ever made it though - other than the shear comical nature of the film..............SO sick of these fake ""best horror movie in a long time"" reviews. This is the poorest excuse ever for a scary movie...unless you are a snowflake. Geeeezzzzz",Creep
309,samanthaljones-28367,Not what you expect,4,30 September 2018,Starts off innocent enough although a bit weird and then it just gets weirder. It wasn't what I was expecting and it definitely didn't give me the creeps,Creep
