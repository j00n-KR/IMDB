0,Leofwine_draca,Shines a spotlight on social issues,5,20 December 2016,"LA HAINE is a well-regarded cinema verite-style French film that follows the misadventures of three youths over the course of a single day as they tangle with rival gangs, vengeful police, and various weird characters out on the streets. It's an entirely low budget production, shot in black and white, that's chiefly of note for being the film that helped propel Vincent Cassel to stardom. Certainly he burns up the screen here with his usual intensity and never disappoints.Otherwise, this is the kind of film that you can take or leave. The critics love it because it shines a spotlight on the social issues affecting France during the day: petty crime and poverty, racism in the police forces, integration, gang culture. I admit that it's a thematically interesting production and it certainly looks and feels distinctive, but I always find that films like this fail to draw me into the lives of the characters in a truly compelling way. I didn't like the leads even though the experiences they go through are typically intense. As such, LA HAINE is watchable but oddly uninvolving.",La Haine
1,SnoopyStyle,"a Jew, an Arab and an African",7,20 March 2016,"Three young friends are hanging out after the immigrant housing projects exploded against the police in a riot the night before. Vinz (Vincent Cassel) is a Jew and sees himself as a gangster. Saïd (Saïd Taghmaoui) is a loud-mouthed Arab. Hubert (Hubert Koundé) is a black boxer. Their friend Abdel was arrested and hospitalized after getting beaten by the police. Vinz has a gun and vows to kill a cop if Abdel dies. Rioters had looted a police station.This movie tries to take on some compelling modern issues. The problem is that the group of friends is so diverse. Instead of realism, the movie seems to be trying to be PC. The movie is missing the religious aspect of the fighting and basing it solely on social class. On the other hand, it tackles the police issue head on. Vinz really needs to be something other than a Jew. The rest is great.",La Haine
2,claudio_carvalho,Life in Black and White,8,25 April 2014,"When the youth Abdel goes to the hospital in coma due to a battering he receives at the police station, there are riots in the outskirts of Paris and one policeman loses his revolver. On the next morning, the Arab Said (Saïd Taghmaoui) summons his Jewish friend Vinz (Vincent Cassel) and they meet the black boxer Hubert (Hubert Koundé) in the slum where they live. Soon Vinz shows the missing gun that he found in the night before and he tells that if Abdel dies, he will revenge his friend killing a police officer. The trio of troublemaker and pothead friends head to the downtown of Paris where they spend the day asking for trouble. On the end of the long night, tragedy happens.The awarded ""La Haine"" is an impressive French movie that follows along 24 hours, the lives of three idle friends from a poor suburb of Paris that belong to a lost generation. I saw this movie in the 90's and today I have decided to see it again to compare the situations shown in the movie with what is recently happening in Brazil with several riots and it is amazing the similarities: lost youths with neither instruction nor job; unprepared and brutal police force; low quality of life in the slums or ghettos in the outskirts of the big cities (in Brazil, there are several slums also in the noble areas). The only difference is basically that France belongs to the First World and Brazil to the Third World; the rest is identical. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): ""O Ódio"" (""The Hate"")",La Haine
3,kosmasp,Circle of ... hate,10,18 June 2020,"This was released 25 years ago, but still feels relevant. Especially with what is going on in America (once again), with the killing of George Floyd. Now the movie does not concentrate on Black Lives Matter (the movement did not exist back then), but focuses on police brutality, a seemlingless inescapable path french youth in certain areas was facing (probably still are facing).The perfomances are quite stunning and while we do have the youth we concentrate on, there are some diverse views on how to act or where to go. The youth, the characters we follow are prisoners ... they are what society and circumstances made them. There are cultural references to movies for exmaple, be it Scarface ""World is yours"", Taxi Driver ""talking to me"" to name but two. The latter is not quoted correctly if the french translation of what is being said is to be believed. But that makes it better, many missquote movies or make them their own. Vincent Cassel is not spoofing De Niro, he makes it a short but powerful moment in the movie.And that is just the beginning. The three friends, different but yet with a core feeling of being sidelined, of not being heard, of being minimalized, is quite intriguing. You feel for them and yet it is very likely you will hate some of their actions. Instead of cancelling them though, how could we help them? The movie does not suggest solutions in that regard. It almost works like a documentary. A gritty, brutal one, that some may call bleak ...",La Haine
4,classicsoncall,"""...it's not how you fall that matters. It's how you land.""",10,1 December 2017,"After watching this film I reflected back on a whole host of films I've seen produced by Warner Brothers back in the Forties and Fifties, having to do with the subject of poverty and how that can lead to crime and lost lives. In a lot of cases, civic and moral dilemmas could often be resolved with right winning out over wrong in the end. In today's world, 'right' often comes up empty handed, and often there's a fine line between differentiating the good from the bad. In many cases, moral equivalency enters the picture, and we're left to distinguish between bad and less bad. It doesn't make for a hopeful situation.That's the sort of picture ""La Haine"" is. Translated, it means 'Hate', and that emotion is palpable throughout the story of three young men with no direction, no job, and nothing to do with themselves except kill time by hanging around in one section of the city or another. Being a French film, the city in this case is Paris, but not the Paris one sees in travel brochures. This story is set in an area of depressing housing projects where the chances of upward mobility doesn't exist, exacerbated by tensions between the police and a diverse population trying to make ends meet.The film is book-ended by an idea submitted as a conversation about a person falling from a high rise window. All the way down, the soon to be deceased person maintains a momentary positive attitude by repeating to himself, 'so far so good', with a corollary offered by the listener that 'it's not how you fall that matters, it's how you land'. This would appear to be good advice for the three principal characters, Said, Vinz and Hubert if they only had the temperament to look at their lives objectively and realize that no one was going to come to their rescue as victims of the projects. That they would have to do for themselves. But with those whose inner rage has ratcheted up to a boiling point, an inevitable hard landing is virtually assured.I thought this was a good film for what it was, even though it doesn't try to provide any answers. The answers, as most rational people know, lie within one's self, and there are many real life examples one can point to of people digging themselves out of a hole to become worthwhile and productive citizens. Unfortunately, many never figure it out, and 'so far, so good' almost never lasts.",La Haine
5,gavin6942,"Hate, French Style",7,8 January 2015,"After local youth Abdel (Abdel Ahmed Ghili) is beaten unconscious by police, a riot ensues on his estate during which a policeman loses his gun. The gun is found by Vinz (Vincent Cassel) who threatens he will kill a cop if Abdel dies.This film was written, co-edited, and directed by Mathieu Kassovitz, and championed by such folks as Jodie Foster (unusual but true). Powerfully done in black and white, it presents a slice of French life with a mix of race and class. In some ways the film (released in 1995) is prescient, because the class conflict was not well-known to Americans until after the 9/11 attacks.In a way, it could be seen as a companion piece to ""Kids"", which came out about the same time. Though they deal with different issues and different cultures, both strongly express what it means to be a youth who is struggling.",La Haine
6,dbdumonteil,the most important thing isn't the fall but the landing,8,2 May 2006,"""La Haine"", probably one of the most momentous French movies of the nineties caused a stir when it opened in 1995 so much so that it became a big social phenomenon. It heralded a genre: the ""film De Banlieue"" whose backdrop is high-risk French suburbs and in its wake, other movies emerged like ""Bye-Bye"" (1995) or ""ma 6-T Va Crack-Er"" (1997). ""La Haine"" remains Mathieu Kassovitz's best moment. Afterwards, he didn't cease to disappoint me. ""Assassin(s)"" (1997) left me uncomfortable and queasy and ""les Rivières Pourpres"" (2000) was an absolute turkey. I haven't seen ""Gothika"" (2003) but he shot it with the Hollywood presence on his back and I fear the worst.To better be immersed in his plan, Kassovitz shot his film in one of these high-risk French suburbs (I can't remember its name but you can check it in the ""filming locations"" rubric when you arrive on the page of the film on this site). This gives his movie an ultra-realist sensation which rings true. In the space of a day, his camera follows a threesome of ruffians. There's Vinz (Vincent Cassel) who acts the tough guy. He is proud of having stolen the gun of a cop and hopes to make good use of it. When he is asked to make an effort of reflection, he loses his temper. Hubert (Hubert Koundé) a pacifist who craves to get out of this daily hell but where to go? He also knows that hate breeds hate. It's both the catalyst of the riots and adds fuel to the fire in the incessant conflicts. And also Saïd (Saïd Thagmaouï), a brazen teenager. The three of them wander in their neighborhood and in Paris between visiting of friends, relationships with the riffraff, the police, arguments, reconciliations and foolish things. An ordinary day during which the trio appears as prisoners of their suburbs and have a life with no horizon. A day which will lead to the inevitable, marked out by the time which often appears on a black screen.Kassovitz did his best to create a stylish film and it paid off well. It was a good idea to have shot his film in a black and white cinematography because it bestows it with a very gritty aura; sometimes there's a documentary whiff which pervades the film. His camera work which commands admiration makes juxtapose travelings, static shots and circular movements according to the vibe a sequence could convey. It also helps to enhance the scenery which is perhaps the fourth main actor of the film after the trio. Overrall, his film is a hard-hitting assessment of a faltering universe (the high-risk suburbs) in which latent tensions and hate reign and it can awake at any time in violence. This hate in question which the inhabitants of these suburbs feel towards the cops is also smoldered in the cops and I wonder if Kassovitz indicts their sometimes intolerable demeanor, especially when some ruffians are kept in police custody. In the beginning of the film, the audience learns that a suspect, Abdel is in a coma at hospital because he was badly injured by the cops during questioning. When they learned this, the toughest guys of these suburbs sparked off a riot. In a way, the attitude of the police helps to fuel the hate and to separate farther the gap and the incomprehension between the inhabitants of these suburbs and the police. That said, Kassovitz doesn't generalize. Not all the cops are monstrous. Check the two sequences when in the first one, a policeman tries to make the riffraff understand in a sensible manner that they can't stay on the roof of a building and the second sequence when Vinz, Hubert and Saïd are in Paris and they ask their way to a policeman who guides them in a polite way.The actors were discerningly chosen and perfectly directed. It seems that Kassovitz fostered improvisation. It was the right method to confer his film with an authentic feeling. They deliver dialogs full of slang, coarse lines and sometimes they're inaudible so you'll have to be very attentive to catch what they say. However, this drawback isn't really irritating and was surely wanted by the director to reinforce the unique spontaneity of the film. With his build and his face of ruffian, Vincent Cassel was ideally cast as the stubborn Vinz while his two main partners are amazingly true to life. And there are some famous French actors who have cameos and who weren't afraid of having demeaning parts like Vincent Lindon, a drunkard or Zinedine Soualem, a sadistic cop.Kassovitz remains as objective as possible and doesn't offer solutions to solve these problems. More than ten years after it reached the streets, his films is still a topical one and the riots and violent incidents which broke out in high-risk suburbs in many French cities the last fall alas show that these tensions aren't alas ready to subside.",La Haine
7,Quinoa1984,best film of its year; pure urban horror filmed in unflinching and poetic eyes,10,5 September 2008,"Matthieu Kassovitz shot out a wad, so to speak, of the kind of ""issue"" movie that had brawn and balls and didn't back down from showing the truth on all sides, and how it's all ultimately ugly and screams for change to happen. How much the film might have changed things in the ghettos of Paris I'm not sure, and possibly it didn't do much. But as an act of cinematic awareness to a grim situation with bravura drama and humor and in the guise of a ""youth"" movie, it's completely captivating. What's strong about it is not just that Kassovitz wont turn away from the cyclical nature of violence between the young citizens brutalized and the cops 'battling' them back causing the ensuing riots, but that nobody is shown as being really right or wrong... Maybe that's not entirely true; La Haine was made for a purpose, through visionary direction and outstanding performances, which is to shed light on something that without any awareness would go on unabated. It's basically like Mean Streets meets Battle of Algiers, if that makes sense.Maybe the latter of those examples is a little extreme an example since it's a wider framework of history and terrorism, whereas this is a work about the little horrors with those who cross the wrong path with the wrong cops in heightened racial and ethnic tension, and is intense on a slightly different level. But it also is relentless in its pursuit of truth at the matter, or rather the filmmaker's heightened and suspenseful level of truth, and it hits the viewer like a gun across the cheeks. While at the same time this societal statement is made there's a real story going on about three young friends (Vincent Cassell, Hubert Kounde, Said Taghmaoui, all named with their characters), one of which carrying a gun he 'found' from one cop who lost it during a riot, and their travels and adventures over a day trying to get money, drugs, or just getting by the haze of bewilderment over their friend dying in a hospital from cops beating and Vinz's demand for revenge *if* he dies.La Haine is an impression of just a part of a city, as much as one can grab in a day's length of time in 'movie-time', but as well as comparisons to Mean Streets may lie there's also one perhaps for Do the Right Thing. Kassovitz isn't afraid to take a current event and turn it into the stuff of rousing character-driven drama with some semblance of plot (in this case the old 'if the gun is used in act then one act five' logic), but like Lee or Scorsese his black and white cinematography that follows these guys around with the verve to keep on a tracking shot or a specific close-up (in a half-ironic close-up Cassel talks to the mirror ala Travis Bickle, a little inspired through a whole other perspective) that speaks so much. And sometimes he'll put a strange but perfect detour in the structure, like the old man telling the story in the bathroom, or the sudden break for break dancing, or that one shot flying across the air from the window of the DJ. Sometimes it's docu-realistic, but then Kassovitz will throw that stylistic curve-ball reminding us this is in-your-face and with an attitude that would make the Clash raise an eyebrow or two.And along with Kassovitz hitting it way out of the park intellectually and emotionally as a filmmaker, his actors are all lock-in-step wonderful for their characters: Taghmaoui, who you might remember from Three Kings or Traitor, as the uppity and bad-joke telling Arab who has attitude to spare but is like a rough puppy at best; Kounde as the one with probably the most common sense as a guy who lost his gym to the riot and gets by smoking hash and trying to get (or talk) Cassel out of trouble; Cassel as the hot-head with something to prove to himself, or so he thinks, carrying the gun and not really knowing its implications. The three of them are not really very bad kids, but they're from the streets and know it well and know what they need to do to act right and behave around amid what is at points squalor (i.e. the subway bit with one after another homeless folks going by) and just rough gang stuff.They're even sensitive performances to a degree, which is important since La Haine, for all its toughness and rigor and occasional blasts of harsh violence, is a beautiful work of a Frenchman who knows what he's doing. It's made by the young and for the young, but it's also made for anyone looking for an example of what is both important and entertaining art after the French new-wave has come and gone. And, as with any great post-modern film, seeing it once isn't enough.",La Haine
8,sunwarrior13,A Great French Film,10,23 October 2012,"While to most outsiders Paris seems the very picture of beauty and civility, France has had a long and unfortunate history of intolerance toward outsiders, and this powerful drama from filmmaker Mathieu Kassovitz takes an unblinking look at a racially diverse group of young people trapped in the Parisian economic and social underclass.La Haine is a French black-and-white drama/suspense film written, co-edited, and directed by Kassovitz and it features Vincent Cassel, Hubert Koundé, Saïd Taghmaoui, Abdel Ahmed Ghili and Solo.Vinz, who is Jewish, Hubert, who is Black, and Said, who is Arabic, are young men from the lower rungs of the French economic ladder; they have no jobs, few prospects, and no productive way to spend their time. They hang out and wander the streets as a way of filling their days and are sometimes caught up in frequent skirmishes between the police and other disaffected youth. One day, a street riot breaks out after police seriously injure an Arab student; the three friends are arrested and questioned, and it is learned that a policeman lost a gun in the chaos. However, what they don't know is that Vinz picked it up and has it in his possession, and when Vinz, Hubert, and Said get into a scuffle with a group of racist skinheads, the circumstances seem poised for tragedy.La Haine is a Generation X film, whatever that means, but more mature and insightful than the American Gen X movies.Kassovitz's iconic film about race, violence, and class struggle is both rousing entertainment and brilliant film making.And he mines so much tension and pointed dialogue from a low budget and deceptively simple premise that you wonder why so much of current Hollywood's own social realism ends up shooting $50 million blanks.A great film indeed.",La Haine
9,hitchcockthelegend,How you fall doesn't matter. It's how you land!,9,20 July 2012,"La haine is written and directed by Mathieu Kassovitz. It stars Vincent Cassel, Hubert Koundé and Saïd Taghmaoui. Original music is by Assassin and cinematography by Pierre Aïm. When a local youth is beaten unconscious by the police, a riot ensues on his Parisian estate during which a policeman loses his gun. As tensions rise, the gun is found by Vinz (Cassel) who proclaims that he will kill a cop if the beaten youth dies.This is not Paris, surely? Where's all the beloved tourist sites and bohemian streets? Of course some way away from this Parisian suburb Paris thrives, but this is a real place, real heat and real hate. Shot in striking black and white, using firebrand young actors and giving them urban wit, angst and aggression, Kassovitz serves up a powder-keg of a movie. It's a portrait of a multiracial community thrust together by one act of police aggression, but the underlying themes of boredom, prejudice and the escalation of hate drip from every tension fuelled frame. The youth characterisations are rich and intelligently drawn (wonderfully performed by the three principals), but the outer edged characters impact greatly as well, even in the most unusual of places like a gents toilet. Layered over the top of it all is a vibrant rap and reggae soundtrack; perfect. Thematically we have seen it all before in cinema, in fact this feels like a composite of Spike Lee, Larry Clark, Martin Scorsese, John Singleton and Alan Clarke films, but it's still very much its own animal, a French concrete jungle where the heat is piercing but the sun can't be seen. As riots continue to blight parts of the world, La haine is still relevant and still packing a punch today. Incendary and grim for sure, but riveting and essential in the pantheon of urban decay cinema. 9/10",La Haine
10,lastliberal,Hate breeds hate!,9,17 November 2007,"Hubert (Hubert Koundé): Heard about the guy who fell off a skyscraper? On his way down past each floor, he kept saying to reassure himself: So far so good... so far so good... so far so good. How you fall doesn't matter. It's how you land! Society is in free fall. There have been at least 300 ""accodental"" deaths at the hands of the French police. The current President of France considers the minorities in France to be ""scum."" This is the story of three of these minority youth and 24 hours in their life after another was murdered by a French policeman.Mathieu Kassovitz (Crimson Rivers, Gothika) has directed a masterpiece showing the youth that are alienated from their parents with their love of rap music and American films, and a culture that is alienated from those in society that are consumed with their incomes, and cars, and fancy houses.The film stars three fantastic actors: Vincent Cassel (Ocean's Twelve & Thirteen, Crimson Rivers, Brotherhood of the Wolf), Hubert Koundé (The Constant Gardener), and Saïd Taghmaoui (The Kite Runner, Hildago). Watching 24 hours in their search for meaning was both funny and sad. Considering that they represent thousands all over the world makes you cry.The photography by Pierre Aïm was magnificent.""The peacemakers, those who are supposed to spread democracy and justice on behalf of our sate and self-satisfied societies, are spreading death, contempt, racism, and humiliation. They are creating a world of hate."" -- Costa Gravas This is an important film that will stand the test of time; a classic that will remind us of what we are doing; and a warning to change direction.",La Haine
11,grantss,"Powerful, thought-provoking drama",9,24 May 2018,"Vinz, Hubert and Said live in the poorer part of Paris and have to use all their street smarts to get by. After an incident in which the police assaulted a friend of theirs, tensions between police and young working-class men, such as themselves, escalate. Incensed at the potential death of his friend, Vinz is out for revenge.Powerful, thought-provoking drama. Shows a society in turmoil, slipping into anarchy, or fascism, depending on the perspective or who has the upper hand. Shows well how easily tensions can escalate and how rogue elements in either camp can fuel the escalation.Kudos to director Mathieu Kassovitz for telling the story in as unbiased a fashion as possible. The movie could easily have ended up being one massive anti-police rant but Kassowitz does a good job at highlighting the issues without ending too much in one camp. Yes, we only see the conflict from the side of the youths, but they are, for the most part, hardly angels themselves. Highly engaging as, even though the main characters are not perfect, you are interested in their lives and story. There is also a cloud of fatalism and inevitability hanging over them, heightening the danger and making you more invested.Incredibly powerful conclusion. Powerful for its message, and for its surprise value. Solid performances all round with Vincent Cassel, as Vinz, the best of the bunch.",La Haine

Don't you just HATE it when some arty Parisienne decides to remake KIDS without the sex, and REBEL WITHOUT A CAUSE with bad hair? Isn't it particularly galling that an American cable TV network prefers to show this pale fictional precursor of FRUITVALE STATION instead of the real thing? What's not to HATE about a flick shot on grainy 16mm black-and-white reels from Grandpa's attic with some random thugs forced to do ""community service"" in front of the camera?

13,morrison-dylan-fan,Stronger Than Hate.,8,6 October 2020,"Having heard about it years ago,this is a title I've been meaning to view for years,but somehow kept missing the chance to. After missing the one-off screening of the new 4K print at the local Odeon a few weeks ago,I was pleased to spot that it had returned,leading to me finding out how hateful things can get.View on the film:Setting the world on fire in a explosive opening shot,co-editor/(with Scott Stevenson) writer/director Mathieu Kassovitz & cinematographer Pierre Aim's decision to have the cast and crew spend three months living in the Parisian suburb of Chanteloup-les-Vignes (after several councils refused to allow the film to be shot in their territory) whilst filming in the location, brings out a visceral urban atmosphere, via the rough & ready camera diving into the the corners of the crumbling suburb.Originally made in colour but changed to black and white after production, the change in presentation allows Kassovitz to weld the Social-realism atmosphere with the fluidity of French New Wave stylisation, brilliantly twisted by Kass into hand-held long whip-pans and dolly zooms across the crime landscape.Picking up the pen after the death of Makome M'Bowole, who in 1993 was killed at point blank range while in police custody and handcuffed to a radiator, the screenplay by Kassovitz unleashes a urgent,ticking time bomb portrait of the suburbs, where the friendship of the trio is forged in the flickers of aggression and frustrated fury that covers the skyline.Running from the cops down the back streets, Hubert Kounde,Said Taghmaoui and Vincent Cassel give a mesmerising ensemble turn as friends Hubert,Said and Vinz,with the blistering pent-up anger they share bursting with a rugged friendship that is stronger than hate.",La Haine

It apes Spike Lee so much that I don't think it ever finds a voice of its own. Plus, its three protagonists, Vinz, Saïd and Hubert are all pretty despicable. Am I really to feel sorry for these guys when they've been insulting and assaulting every person they run into? Kind of reminds me of the American film Kids, too. Sure, the film is, I assume, steeped in honesty about its characters. But that doesn't mean I feel sorry for them in the end. The film is very well made, if a little self-conscious about its freshness. Doesn't surprise me much that director Kassovitz went on to make Gothika.",La Haine
15,deloudelouvain,One of the better French movies ever,9,16 May 2018,"If you've never seen La Haine then you definitely have to watch it. If you've seen it before you know that you will watch it again at some point. I must have seen it five times by now and I still love it as it was the first time. Most of my generation saw the movie when it came out and now this movie is passed on from generation to generation. It's a movie that is at it's best when you fully understand the French language, aspecially the street language ""verlan"", that means à l'envers or backwards, a language that's been spoken by mostly youth thugs in the suburbs. The movie itself is a view of the harsh life in the suburbs in France, a life without many opportunities nor things to do except hanging around with your mates in the ghetto. The hate towards the police is normal and justified as they are seen as pariah. The movie, shot in black and white, is a must watch, even with subtitles, it still works. Vincent Cassel in his early years, it's something to watch. Like the rest of the cast, it all works perfectly to create that special atmosphere from La Haine. The soundtrack is one of the cd's they I still enjoy, so many years later.",La Haine
16,Red-Barracuda,Social-realism with cinematic style,8,26 July 2011,"La haine characterised a 90's strand in French cinema where there was a focus on depicting contemporary social issues. A particular point of interest was the banlieue; this is the suburbs of Paris where the working classes were moved to from the 1950's onwards. These housing estates in the outer areas of the city were made up of high-rise blocks and the quality of accommodation was poor. This segregation of the working people from the higher income brackets led to an alienation that was felt especially in the younger generations who only knew this situation. La haine looks at three young men from this very context.After a riot the police lose a gun. This weapon falls into the hands of three young men from the ghetto. These guys represent three ethnic groups prevalent in the banlieue, one is Jewish, one is black and the third is Arabic. This gun gives them a sense of power which they ordinarily do not feel they have. They feel disenfranchised and seeing that France has rejected them they do not look to France for cultural icons; they look to America for this, particularly Hollywood films. This film looks at a highly-charged day in the life of these three young men. It considers what happens when you try to cage an animal. The animal will attempt to fight back. The French riots that happened a decade after this film was released are testimony to the wisdom of this lesson.Mathieu Kassovitz's film isn't just about gritty realism though, as despite the subject matter and urban drama genre, it's a very cinematic film. There are quite a few audacious camera moves and the influence of Martin Scorsese's Mean Streets in particular is hard to avoid. Like that film. there isn't really much of a story in La haine, so if this is what you need out of a film then it may disappoint. It's much more of a character and environment study. I guess it's where social-realism meets cinematic style.",La Haine
17,cherold,intense and brilliantly filmed,8,30 July 2020,"La Haine follows three young men navigating their slum in the aftermath of a riot. It is grim and intense with moments of humor, and stunningly, stylishly filmed in black and white.The three boys are distinct. One is eternally on the edge, especially once he acquires a gun that leaves him constantly at the edge of trouble. One is pretty smart and trying to keep everything in check. The other is in the middle, angry but neither out of control nor having a deep understanding of his life.The movie is episodic yet has a coherent narrative structure that pushes constantly forward.La Haine is an ""issues"" film, but it's not an ""answers"" film. The boys seem doomed, but they are also criminally minded. The police are also criminals, and there is a remarkably disturbing scene of cops torturing two of the boys that is hard to watch. The message of the movie seems to be, ""everything is terrible and what can be done?""The ending is ... man, that was intense. All of it comes together in a final two minutes that sears your heart.It's not an easy movie, but it is a brilliant one and well worth watching.",La Haine
18,ElMaruecan82,The French Disconnection...,9,5 October 2021,"It's the story of a trio that would sound like the opening of a 'bar' joke... but more striking than their ethnicity is the fact that they're preceded by the reputation of their 'milieu' and can't go anywhere without raising suspicious eyes from the good society drenched by all the TV news reports featuring apocalyptic sides of burning cars, riots and an unfortunate list of incidents of young thugs dead in police stations.Indeed, director Matthew Kassovitz show that these three young fellows never go unnoticed from the way they talk, the way they move, the way they behave, insult or retort to insults. They carry the mark of their 'Les Muguets' upbringing like a war wound. From an American perspective, ""La Haine"" (or ""Hate"") was after King but before Floyd, and still relevant after 25 years. One would label the film as the French answer to Spike Lee's ""Do The Right Thing"" or the urban Gen X-defining movie like ""Trainspotting"" one year later but while these comparaisons hold certain truths, while ""Hate"" might be about racism, about cop violence and the aimlessness of a generation that is entitled to feel like the sacrificial lambs of liberalism, ""Hate"" exposes issues that are very much specific to France.France is a country that has a problem with the very idea of a melting-pot and as today, it is the ""hot topic"" of the 2022 Presidency, and gloves aren't worn anymore when it comes to denounce the ethnic aspect of violence in French society. And if ""Hate"" was an antidote to such thoughts, it might have the reverse effect today. If anything this is a film to handle with care.The film centers on Vincent Cassel as Vinz, Said Taghmaoui (Said) and Hubert Koundé (Hubert) and apart from their diverging ethnicities, these kids have the same urban DNA albeit different personalities. Vinz is the loud-mouth and trigger-happy who emulates De Niro in front of his mirror, Hubert is a boxer and perhaps the closest to the voice of reason, blasé about the things of racism without ignoring the fundamental realities, and Said is the most easy-going one, the shortest and the one who doesn't want trouble. What unites these kids is the hazard of life, born in the same grey urban area deserted by education, visited by patrolling cars and without any visible life prospects whatsoever.Kassovitz establishes the film after one of these kids' friends was arrested and later transferred to a hospital, a sort of quietness after the storm. The young man is between life and death and when a policeman doesn't let the trio go visit him, his politness doesn't calm them and is regarded as a provocation. In fact anything from a stranger is perceived as a provocation. These boys grow up with such a sense of adversity that anyone who isn't family or friend is a potential enemy. Interestingly, Kassovitz doesn't insist on the ethnic element, except for Vinz' religion there's never the assumption that their background is the problem, if anything, it's the cause of the problem: racism and its own solution: a fraternal bond that doesn't exist within the confined walls of the neighboring city; Paris.The leitmotif of Kassovitz is a ticking sound combined with the famous joke of the man falling from the building (Steve McQueen told it in ""The Magnificent Seven"") with the laconic voice-over repeating ""so far, so good"", so in a way, we know there will be an incident and that the film isn't the kind to afford a happy ending and as it progresses toward its tragic conclusion, I could feel my nerves getting alert at the least provocation, thinking it might come from Vinz who brandishes his Smith & Wesson with such pride he's obviously waiting for the right moment.... But that would be too easy and I suspected maybe something else might happen. This is one of these movies where you don't know where it's heading but you know it's no good and the black-and-white choice is perfect not just because of the artistic look, but because it makes the transition from Les Muguets to Paris almost unnoticeable, even with the Eiffel tower in the background, these kids' life is as grim and desolate.In that 24-hour journey, there are many interesting scenes, one shows them listening to a little old man telling a funny story in a toilet and it's a relief to see Vinz finally smiling (the last shot of that scene had me dying laugh) and another scene where they try to approach a girl and then realize that they just don't have the right 'way' to talk and they just can't help it and it's rather heart-breaking because at that point, you realize the alienating effect of suburbs, they create a subculture that has its worth but can't find its application outside, at some points, you can tell, they're eager to get back to their home. Some scenes aren't as lighthearted and shed the light on the brutality from the police department, but they don't show cops as villains but rather ill-paid civil servants who got so tired of their own ordeals, they've mixed up everything and have lost the will to understand.There's a lot of anger and frustration in ""Hate"" and Kassovitz finds a clever way to translate them into stylish shots that sometimes betray his American influences, in the beginning, I felt he was trying to channel Lee or Scorsese but maybe because these kids were born with the cult of the U. S. A, cartoons, crime flicks, street art that it's only coherent that the film would adopt codes that offer the best medium of expression for this lost generation, the Gen-X of all Gen-Xes..That Said Taghmaoui found a better career in the U. S. A says a lot about France having a 'problem' with his immigrants, it's precisely their disapproval of the multiculturalism that emphasized the racial divisions and it's not getting any better.But, so far, so good...",La Haine
19,MOscarbradley,Very much a young person's film,8,27 November 2007,"Very much a young person's film both in style and temperament stunningly shot in wide screen monochrome by Pierre Aim and covering 24 hours in the lives of three friends from a Parisian housing estate in the aftermath of a riot in which a fourth member of their clan has been shot and seriously wounded by the police. Fundamental to events is a gun lost by the police and found by Vinz, one of the boys in question, who has vowed that if his friend dies he will kill 'a pig'.It's an exciting, visceral, nihilistic picture influenced by the likes of Scorcese and filmed with much the same documentary like precision that Pontecorvo applied to ""The Battle of Algiers"" and an influence in turn on the work of British directors like Shane Meadows. A pre-credit prologue in which we are told of a man falling to his death from a 50-storey building should alert us to the fact that no matter what the outcome it isn't likely to be a happy one for anyone concerned. Writer/director Mathieu Kassovitz has no illusions about happy endings and violence and the prospect of a sudden, early death figures large in the lives of the protagonists.It's not a great film; it's too much of a patchwork quilt of outside influences but it is brilliantly made, it's full of energy and it clearly marked out Kassovitz as a director worth watching.",La Haine
20,ThomasDrufke,The World is Yours,8,6 October 2019,"24 years later, a story about 24 hours in the life of three young men in France after riots and police brutality change their lives, still feels incredibly relevant. In fact, I wrote down in my notes that the film is ripe for a remake, whether that be a film or mini-series, it feels like time. Whether it's the unclear symbolism of the cow, it's comment on the power you feel with a gun, references to Taxi Driver, or other various homages, La Haine clearly has a lot on its mind, and I'm all here for it, right up to its final, brutal & devastating moments.

22,briancham1994,Hard-hitting social realism,9,23 April 2021,"I watched this soon after 400 Blows and the portrayal of Paris makes for an interesting comparison. If 400 Blows is about how society has failed children, then La haine is about how society has failed its teenagers and young adults. The protagonists of this film are played by very talented actors, who expertly convey the desperately aggressive poor suburban youth. This portrayal might have gone too far though, as their attempts to make a name for themselves leads to many moments which make them unsympathetic. Despite the hostility of their surroundings, it is still hard for me to connect with characters who would probably steal my car if I ever met them in real life. The nine stars are for the skillful atmosphere, with bleak cinematography, dirty mise-en-scene and talented actors contributing to a realistic portrayal of a society falling to its death. Its major weakness is its plot, as it seems like a lot of meandering that does not really go in any particular direction until the end.",La Haine
23,eddie_baggins,A heartfelt and relevant tale of injustice and humanity,8,19 May 2021,"An incendiary independent black and white offering from France that has managed to remain relevant and oft spoken about these 25 plus years on from initial release, Mathieu Kassovitz's personal and heartfelt La Haine (simply meaning The Hate) is a memorable exploration of social injustice and simmering tensions and a feat its filmmaker will always struggle too top.Following up his work here with some serious forgettable forays into Hollywood such as Gothika and Babylon A. D. and a spattering of other forgotten about foreign films, actor/director Kassovitz can always hang his hat on La Haine as a documentary like exploration of his home city and his own experiences as youth in the often boiling pot of emotions that exist in France's most well-known city.Never bothering with a straight forward narrative driver, as Kassovitz instead examines an event filled 24 hours in the lives of acquittances and Paris residents Vinz (Cassel), Hubert (Kounde) and Said (Taghmaoui), with the three teenagers full of anger and hostility following on from their involvement in a series of riots that sprung up in the wake of a police beating of a young man they all know.All three performers deliver feisty and energetic turns, particularly from the then 28 year old Vincent Cassel who brings Vinz to life with a verve and fierceness that held him in good stead for what has been so far an extremely consistent and intriguing career and as Kassovitz throws his three characters, actors and audiences into the thick of an unpredictable time and place we are drawn into a life like and confronting drama that unfortunately feels as though it could've been drawn straight from today's headlines.Initially upon release only a minor hit despite strong reviews and audience reactions, La Haine's ability to continue to be spoken about and affect modern day audiences has ensured its standing as one of the great examples of world cinema and one of the most memorable cinematic ventures France has ever produced, one that's power was so evident upon release with then Prime Minister Alain Juppé screening the film for his parliament, such was its effectiveness in exploring issues present then and still today in the country.Final Say -A searing independent offering that may be rough around the edges in parts but still full of power and importance, La Haine is a once in a blue moon type cinematic offering that remains relevant and needful to this day.4 missed trains out of 5.",La Haine
24,johnnyboyz,"No Hate for La Haine, just admiration and a palpable sense of improvement over time.",10,26 June 2008,"Why do people riot? Why do things become so pent up, that the only solution to the ill-feeling is a violent eruption of chaos and violence? In post-war Britain, probably the worst of what immediately preceded the events that unfold in ""La Haine"" occurred in 1981 and 2011, when communities and often entire cities burnt for several days with conflicting explanations as to why. Conclusions are often reached along racial; economic and moral grounds - might all play their own part?Commenting on 1981, John Tyndall lamented as to how it was inevitable that trouble would erupt when non-white citizens, often of a completely different temperament; character and cultural stock, were thrust into compact post-war urban areas not built for this purpose. The Prime Minister of the time, Margaret Thatcher, blamed in her memoir unemployment and the erosion of moral fibre brought about by 60's reform: personal pride and a sense of community had disappeared. Explaining away the nightmare of 2011, Laurie Penny deduced an austerity drive on the things that made life bearable (youth centres and jobseekers allowances) as being the catalyst for the trouble - that, and the incessant police harassment.France is not a place I can speak for with any tremendous authority - I imagine the deductions are largely the same. When, years ago, I first saw ""La Haine"", a 1995 guerrilla film starring amateurs and made by first timers, I found it kinetic and oddly enjoyable in the way an action film might be. Seeing it a second time, I was struck by how little I appreciated it first time as a piece told from a character's (Hubert) point of view as he worried for the future of one of his friends, who seemed to be heading the way of violence and criminality. Watching it years later; being able to appreciate its social commentaries, and the particularly fine lines the film treads between taking sides within these commentaries, has embedded it as one of my all-time favourite films.""La Haine"" unfolds in the wake of a night of severe rioting in a Parisian suburb, with characters Saïd (Saïd Taghmaoui); Vincent (Vincent Cassel) and the aforementioned Hubert (Hubert Koundé) being those whom the film follows. The three are Arabic; Jewish and black - deliberately epitomising the diversity of the banlieues. There is evident tension between the cops and the local kids, pre-eminently down to the fact a local boy named Abdul - a friend of the threesome - has been beaten so badly he is in hospital.Meanwhile, somebody somewhere on the estate has a policeman's gun which was lost amidst the chaos - things could blow up at any moment. Capturing the sense of a group fighting against the odds, Mathieu Kassovitz begins the piece with a character quoting from ""The Magnificent Seven"", while another character separately re-enacts scenes from ""Taxi Driver"", which of course ended in a bloody rampage when the lead becomes besotted with firearms.The film portrays a society tearing itself apart, confirming said notion through the use of Hubert's narration, although how accurate the warning shot has proven to be can only be answered by somebody living on the frontline of where it depicts. Perhaps unsubtly, Kassovitz interjects coverage of the crisis in Bosnia unfolding at the same time on a large television screen as the boys wait around at a shopping mall - it is no coincidence, with ""La Haine"" already all too keen to remind us that Paris is a melting pot of skinheads; middle class Le Pen voters; kids from the ghetto and metropolitan champagne-socialist types who, even when the problem lands flush at their feet, are clueless as to how to respond to it.But the film is far from a mere hatchet job - there is no feeling sorry for one's self, or providing the audience with soppy lectures on how it's all everybody else's fault. In the wake of the rioting; burning and generalised madness, it is the working man and the very people who live in the banlieues who suffer most: fire has gutted the gym Hubert owned, while another friend had his car torched overnight and so cannot go to work in order to live. There is a palpable sense that the rioting has only incensed the police further and very little political ground has been gained. Just who is the winner here?Writing for Sight and Sound in 1995, Keith Reader quotes Kassovitz that ""La Haine"" is meant to be 'understood' as an 'anti-police film', but the police are rarely portrayed as anything else other than people merely trying to do their job: the clearing of a rooftop picnic; guarding Abdul's hospital room, etc. Later on in central Paris, Saïd is stunned at how one policeman even refers to him as 'sir' when getting directions and a plain clothes officer back on the estate is more than helpful in his relationship with the boys. Nobody, however, could condone the behaviour of our leads when they gate-crash a gallery, nor indeed wish that anybody might escape the police pursuit which erupts in the wake of somebody taking aim at a cop car with a shotgun.The film still holds that 'kinetic' feel to it years later. That is despite the fact it is far from some kind of deliberately made entertainment - shootings and getaways occur, but they are not designed to put smiles on our faces. Like war films, we grimace at the sound of a gun, which may or may not be the point Kassovitz is trying to make: like Bosnia, Paris is a warzone, albeit only comparatively. When, however, the three lads are stuck in the centre of the city; Vincent begins to feel compelled to shoot a policeman and desperation sets in, the film cannot help but excrete a kind of rabid energy maybe akin to the final acts of a blockbuster. Unquestionably, the film is one of raw power and energy; at once terrifying and alarming - one which is startling every time it is viewed.",La Haine
25,leplatypus,« everything that glitters » with testosterone (vhs),10,2 January 2016,"This 2010 movie from Geraldine could be the feminine version of this movie as the two speaks about the life in a block suburb. Those two movies couldn't have been made before because those urban innovations hadn't been invented so far ! Sure the life over there seems alienating as there is nothing else except the buildings and in addition, the apartments are small ! To grow up there helps being uncomfortable and in each movie, Paris, the big real city with a past, an history, shops and everything else attracts like a magnet ! However, the big difference between the two movies is the gender feeling : Geraldine is soft, hopeful, constructive ! Here, the boys are like a wolf-pack : ready to bite every time, barking for everything The director doesn't want to stigmatize a community as the trio of friends counts a Muslim, a Jew and a black Christian. They all share a lack of family monitoring and just can't stand authority ! So even it's disturbing and sad, the movie tells a certain truth and is a rare opportunity to enter this new french territories and way of life. Kasowicz was inspired to build a excellent drama on this background as well as beautifully picturing this angular suburb. The trio of friends are excellent, very natural, especially for Cassel as he had surely a golden childhood",La Haine
26,TheMovieDiorama,La Haine incites provocative hatred within an uncompromising socioeconomic divide.,9,9 July 2019,"The inevitable rise in impoverished settlements to cater for France's unwanted incline of immigrants was a blistering event that catapulted French governmental bodies across the country in the 90s. The escalating friction between these trapped civilians and policing forces notoriously allowed documentation of blazing riots to take place. Vandalism, bodily harm and even death. Society free-falling into violence that would shake, not just the country, but the world. Kassovitz' monochromatic drama may just very well be the most naturally realistic drama ever put to film. Three young friends, born of differing descents and into immigrant families, struggle adjusting their temperament after a riot the previous day, where one of them yearns to avenge the hospitalisation of his friend.""Hatred breeds hatred"" calmly states Hubert, an Afro-French boxer who lusts for a more fortunate life. ""I know who I am and where I'm from!"" retorts Vinz, a Jewish immigrant accepting the circumstance that he finds himself in. ""Wow. what a speech! Half Moses, half Mickey Mouse."", a young impressionable Saïd jokes. Three seemingly variant individuals that are entangled in a societal decline that would bring them closer than ever. Kassovitz paints a potent portrait of 90s France. Racial discord, neglected housing projects and tainted egalitarianism. However, for this banlieue, it's too late. Its inhabitants respond with violence and cruelty, carrying an anti-policing theme throughout.Who's to blame for the mindless hostility? The immigrants living in poverty because their fantastical government placed them in a descending trap? Or the police for treating these civilians like scum? Whatever the answer, there is no denying that Kassovitz' vision is an eclectic exemplar of urban cinema. His ability to convey the festering hatred of both sides is breathtakingly effective. A monochromatic palette to represent the repressed opportunities that these families occupy themselves in. The long one take sequences depicting the arduous days that these people live, no wait, survive. The sprawling urban communities resembling colonies for its workers who are unable to seize any opportunity. ""The world is yours"" read many joyous billboards within Paris.However, what really elevates Kassovitz' vision, is the naturally realistic characters. These three friends, no matter how serrated their friendships might be, look out for each other. As we follow a mere twenty-four hours of their diminished lives, there are times when the ""main plot"" meanders. The beauty is, there isn't really a plot. The film is a window into a warped fantasy that is unfortunately becoming a reality. Vinz, Hubert and Saïd will simply have meaningless conversations that provide no narrative flow. But in doing so, it furthers their chemistry and our emotional attachment to their injudicious lives. All building up to that final microcosm that will leave you speechless. Perfectly portrayed by Cassel, Koundé and Taghmaoui, each harnessing a unique personality to differentiate their characters. Physically and emotionally exhuming transformative performances.Although they power the nail-biting narrative, it's the inclusion of minor scenes that provides a bold outline in Kassovitz' portrait of 90s France. Whether it be Vinz sneaking into various cinema screenings, coincidentally only showing films of excessive violence. Or an unexpected story about God, told by an old man in a public bathroom. Perhaps the neglectful treatment when in police custody. Maybe, that final impending shot. The point is, every scene, action and line of dialogue never felt out of place. Everything was perceived to be real. And you can tell, almost instantly from the first montage of riots, that this was a personal endeavour for Kassovitz, who he himself participated in such events.Almost exhuming a documentary aesthetic, La Haine is as as real as it gets. Despite a minor reservation on the occasional meandering, this is urban cinema executed to perfection. Controversial in nature, but anodyne in reality. ""It's not how you fall that matters. It's how you land.""",La Haine
27,SAMTHEBESTEST,French Cinema's Effective look on Social and Economic divisions is decelerated by speed breakers,6,27 July 2020,"La Haine (1995) :
Brief Review -French Cinema's Effective look on Social and Economic divisions is decelerated by speed breakers. Some sensitive and controversial topics from society haven't been attempted by Cinema world because of fear may be or lack of conviction. Long-festered topic like social and economic divisions was hot post 90s because of notable events happened in Paris in 1990. La Haine is highly concerning to this case and effective sends the message which was needed. It depicts 24 hours of lives of three friends after the violent riots took place in the city. It is about common people versus brutal cops and it is very much in realistic zone rather than dramatic one. There is no problem in the script looking at the final shot given but screenplay isn't tight and sticked to the matters. It adds so many unnecessary statements and useless scenes which haven't got anything to do with the topic hence losing the grip of the film. A film with 96 minutes runtime should keep it interesting for whole time at least thats what i believe and La Haine failed here. I checked the runtime bar couple of times during those 96 minutes. Otherwise i don't mind about other aspects of La Haine. Acting by Vincent Cassel, Hubert Kounde and Said Taghmaoui looked convincing and thier dialogues came out well despite heavy dose of abusive language. Screenplay like I said had flaws and cinematography was decent. Director Mathieu Kassovitz's conviction was right and praiseworthy but i would have been more happy if only he had made it little dramatic and engaging. It is not that i don't like slow paced films, i do but i care about the kind of touch and crafting to you give to the subject. La Haine could have easily been more powerful in Cinematic space and i might have called it a Classic then. For now, i say this is good and gutsy attempt but needed little more matured storytelling.RATING - 6/10*By - #samthebestest",La Haine

29,jzappa,High-Quality Delivery of a Story of Significant Cultural Importance,9,2 September 2008,"Since his hard-hitting debut, Mathieu Kassovitz seems to have become caught up in Hollywood and Hollywood-style action adventure projects, entirely unlike his debut. However, this entrance, La Haine, is an intense time-tabled portrait of three very identifiably characterized young friends in an impoverished multi-ethnic housing project in the aftermath of a great riot. Exceedingly powerful French flamethrower Vincent Cassel, who plays a Jew, is filled with rage. He sees himself as a gangster ready to win street cred by killing a cop, and molds himself after De Niro in Taxi Driver. Saïd Taghmaoui is a cheery and chatty Arab who attempts to work as peacemaker and tries to find a balance between his two friends' reaction to the world around them. Hubert Koundé is a black boxer and drug dealer. Most quiet and sensitive of the three, he sorrowfully contemplates the ghetto and the surrounding spawn of hate, wanting just to escape the degenerate atmosphere of brutality and hatred but lacks the resources. The three actors play characters who share their first names, which is an interesting touch because it is a quick and easy way for them to familiarize each other to the extent of being tightly bonded friends, as they address each other reflexively even in front of the camera. A friend of theirs has been brutalized by the police after a riot and lies in a coma. Vincent finds a cop's gun lost in the riot. He vows that if their friend dies from his injuries, he will use it to kill a cop.This sets off events that take the three down a foreboding and fatalistic path of destruction. Kassovitz plunges into his intentions by creating an innately realistic and unabashedly gritty capsule. Aside from being shot in stark black and white, which is almost reminiscent of Louis Malle's Elevator to the Gallows, his script does not work like conventional clockwork. The characters do not follow the story, but vice versa. After an intense chapter of the movie in which the three are profiled by police in central Paris, where they are clearly distinguishable as fish out of water, the film slows to their speed as they wander, sit and brood.As an American, I think La Haine is of significant cultural importance because just as foreigners see American films and develop the impression that we are all rich and surrounded by scenic and urban gloss and beauty, Americans see other cultures in the same misunderstood light, one of these cultures being French. This film distinguishes a substantial pocket of France that shares with the United States the racial unrest, white privilege, minority discrimination and profiling, and socially burdened rage instilled generationally and traditionally.",La Haine
30,Vartiainen,The trap that is woven from both outside and inside,8,26 June 2017,"The movie follows three young men in the suburbs of Paris. Violent riots have plagued the neighbourhood for days after a police officer shot another young man with immigrant background. And thus the movie becomes a story about the struggle of those that are trapped in the suburbs, with very few prospects and no way out of their second class dwellings.The movie is shot in a very stark manner, both visually and thematically. It is made clear that although these immigrants and their descendants were at least somewhat forced into the suburbs and it has not been made easy for them to get out, the boys themselves are also to be blamed. They're all grown men, albeit just barely, but none of them seem to have any plans, barely any education and only a bad attitude to sustain them from day to day. And this aimlessness is reflected in their rioting. They talk a lot about eye for an eye, but even they can admit - even if they will not say it aloud - that it won't solve anything. They're stuck. Not to say that the police are guiltless. Bad attitudes and learned habits plague both sides and set them against one another.The movie however doesn't offer all that many answers. Its central question is in the form of ""What?"", not ""Why?"" or ""How do we solve this?"". And that is also important. We need to understand the problem before we can go about solving it. And that is why this film was so relevant back on its day, and why it is still relevant over twenty years later. Because we are still struggling with these questions, these problems.La Haine is an important film. It in a very real manner showcases exactly how we are failing as a society and what there is to fix. Very good watch for all looking for grit, asphalt and lonely streets.",La Haine
31,Polaris_DiB,The French's answer to Spike Lee,6,17 May 2007,"""Hate"" is one of the two movies that have been recommended to me the most (the other, if you care, is Sansho the Bailiff). Criterion's recently release of it in region 1 finally allowed me to see it, and though it's well made and decently enough written, I can't say I'm a huge fan.""Hate"" is the French answer to Spike Lee, right down to the floaty camera and the constant emphasis on racial tension. It starts on a riot, then introduces three friends (one Arab, one Jew, and one black) the next day, then goes to a party where someone says, ""Did you hear about the pig (cop) that lost his gun last night?"", and from there the entire movie is spelled out to anyone familiar with this type of story.This movie is a social commentary on racism, class warfare, and ""hateful"" mentality, and it doesn't add much new to the mix except a cow (symbol of the character's misdirection) and a joke/theme about a man falling several stories to his death. The rest of it--the strange old man with the anecdote in the bathroom, the tracing of the gun as it changes hands but persists in remaining with the friends, the music, and the drawing up of the characters--are all tropes of what is becoming something of a recognizable sub-sub-genre within the already known ""Urban Drama"" sub-genre. And, like all those other films, this film isn't really interested as much in providing answers or clues as to what to do about humanity's tendency to hate as it is more interested in waxing poetic over it.Not to say it's that bad of a movie, and technically the world can use a thousand movies like it until people finally get the point. But really, for one like me pretty uninterested in the theme and more interested in the medium itself, this movie really doesn't have much more to offer.--PolarisDiB",La Haine
32,FilmCriticLalitRao,Some Frenchies are afraid of this film as it exposes negative side of France,8,20 July 2007,"France is slowly becoming a poor European country and many French people are not so happy with this film.If you pay a visit to any of the so called French cultural centers you will be surprised to find that this film will not be in the space meant for DVDs. Why is that so ? The decision to exclude La Haine from DVD space is due to the fact that France is the only nation in the world which relies heavily on its past glory.In our modern international world,it still talks of Moliere, Balzac etc knowing fully well that no one (at least French youth) is interested in them.France has nothing latest,recent,modern, contemporary to showcase to the whole world.French language books are always devoted to its writers,singers,new wave cinema etc.There is no chapter,no description of its immigrants,ghetto life and racism. Whatever that has been depicted in this film is the naked burning reality.Such was the impact of this film at the time of its release premier Alain Juppe had to call for a special screening to know what all the fuss was.One final word:three male leads:one Arab, one Jew and one Christian, isn't that bit intentional as well as obvious.May be Kassovitz wanted to reach as many communities as possible.",La Haine
33,MaxBorg89,French cinema at its most shocking!,10,22 February 2006,"Bold, violent, provocative, La Haine is a remarkable, mesmerizing achievement, a raw punch in the face. Few other movies are this socially relevant, and if you want to learn something valuable, I suggest you watch this film. It was made in 1995, but has lost none of its strength.The movie takes place in the Parisian suburbs, where three angry, confused and frustrated young men live. These three (Vincent Cassel, Hubert Koundé and Said Taghmaoui) have different ethnic and cultural backgrounds, and don't feel very French. They also don't have any idea of what they wanna do with their lives, unless it's got something to do with drugs, thefts or riots. Then one day, one of their friends, brutally beaten by the cops, ends up in a hospital, with little chance of survival. Life tries to go on normally, but Vinz (Cassel) wants to avenge his buddy. It's up to Hubert and Said to make sure a blood bath won't start...Writer/director Mathieu Kassovitz (also behind the first Crimson Rivers flick) gives a very realistic look on everyday life, which isn't always a joy. Despite some really funny moments (a dealer named Asterix, Cassel doing a Taxi Driver impression, the Tarantinoesque discussion about Tom & Jerry), this black and white milestone of French movie industry remains a very serious, brutal, unflinching film. The bleak ending is just the definitive proof of what the entire movie is trying to teach us: hate and violence will only cause more violence (this aspect makes La Haine quite similar to Spike Lee's Do The Right Thing).This movie should be shown to everyone, so that people can understand what doesn't work in our society.Films with a strong message keep being important even 20 years after their release. La Haine is such a film.",La Haine

Sound and fury are the only means for many communities to make themselves heard.This black-and-white chronicle of twenty-four hours in the life of a mixed-race young male trio from a run-down banlieue has resonated with me as a product of young rebellious creatives - sometimes random, sometimes explosive - a raw stubbornness that transcends countries, genres, politics.This visionary film elicits passion and provokes thought, and is that rare combination: a cult movie that is also a classic film.",La Haine

The cinematography proves to be a great treat for the eyes, displaying nice plays of pan and zoom at time and also genius camera angles, especially at the long shots. The scenes also prove to be really strong, although in essence they actually depict only simple and everyday life activities. Yet as a whole I feel that the movie didn't present a solid story. Yes the theme, proclaimed vividly in the title, gets to be ever present all throughout the movie. But between each scenes there seem to be less coherence and lack a bigger picture to connect them as a whole. Furthermore, the ending comes very much abruptly with the subject being stretched just prior to it coming. The acting overall feels very nice. The trio of Vincent Cassel, Hubert Kounde and Said Taghmaoui presented a very nice acting work. Their relationship seems very natural and fluid, especially with those long dialogs.

40,RainDogJr,"""that's why we're gonna be burnin' and a-lootin' tonight""",10,31 August 2011,"LA HAINE is a film that really needs to say something. That really needs to shout something. You can tell that since the beginning. When you get a series of black and white images of riots, with Bob Marley's ""Burnin' and Lootin'"" as the background music (a perfect choice, certainly), you know you're into some serious stuff. Indeed, this movie deals with strong stuff: it's about a group of three friends who live in the suburbs of Paris, France. The word ""suburbs"" is certainly highly associated with constant crime, drugs, and riots. Our characters are in the middle of all of this, influenced by all of this. I just love when movies succeed in the end in saying exactly what they wanted. Think in American HISTORY X for that sort of point. LA HAINE does that, and it's just great. Also, it is one of the most unique movies out there, since as a ""social drama"" it still brought to my mind a movie like Kevin Smith's CLERKS. Why? The reason is that here we have a lot of time the ""characters doing nothing"" kind of thing. We see some moments of an entire day of our three main characters. One can imagine we are seeing the most relevant moments of their day. The day is the day after a huge riot, which started because a police officer seriously damaged a young man during the course of an interrogation, sending him to the hospital. So, there's lots of tension, and the main thing is that Vincent Cassel's character (Vinz) says that if the man in the hospital dies (which is very probable), he will ""avenge"" him by killing a cop. I said we see the most relevant moments of the day of our characters. We see, for instance, how a kid from around there relates to Vinz stuff about a TV show and how Vinz fails when he tries to cut in a nice way the hair of his mate Said (Said Taghmaoui). Yes, the day of the three is sometimes just a pretty darn normal one, hence my thought in a movie like the one of Kevin Smith. For many moments we can forget, together with them, about all the existing tension. All of this is perfectly done, with a great tone of humor (I would use the word ""hilarious"" for the two moments I just mentioned), and a great, and very natural, interaction between the actors. This helps a lot to make of Vinz, Said and Hubert truly unforgettable characters. Is all great here, great filmmaking (look for that scene when Vinz sees a murder outside a bar) it's simply a must-see. Unforgettable stuff.",La Haine
41,bkrauser-81-311064,"""Things Fall Apart"" in La Haine",9,4 November 2013,"When I was in high school, read the book Things Fall Apart by Chinua Achebe in my English class. The novel follows the life of a Igbo tribesman and his kin as they adjust to the arrival of Christian missionaries and struggle with the impact of British colonial rule. It's a great book that illustrates Western cultures' largely grim history towards ""less civilized"" societies. Better still, Things Fall Apart is not liberal white guilt shrouded in anthropological verses; it's a book that attempts to accurately portray things as they were and as they eventually became. The main character Okonkwo isn't a mindless barbarian nor a noble tribesman but somewhere in-between. Hubert, Vinz and Said, the main characters of La Haine (1995) (roughly translates from French to Hate), are much like Okonkwo. They are not quite saints or sinners, just a gang of French kids with little to do but sit around and watch the world throw insult and injury at their banlieue.But let us start at the beginning; 10:38am. Said (Said Taghmaoui) a young man of Middle Eastern descent is standing outside of Vinz's (Vincent Cassel) house waiting for him to wake up. He calls out his name creating a ruckus Vinz's neighbors don't take too kindly to. As Vinz goes about his business getting ready there is a menorah behind him. They meet up with Hubert (Hubert Kounde) a young black man just trying to keep his nose clean especially since the last riot in the banlieue left many public buildings ransacked and his friends may have been involved. To top it all off, one of their friends Abdel was put into a coma while in police custody and Vinz vows to get revenge anyway he can.The precipitating macguffin is a lost police firearm that the trio get ahold of. Vinz would like to use it to kill a cop if Abdel dies and holsters it like a gangster wannabe. Through the gun, the audience travels with the young multi-ethnic men through nineteen hours in the life. The voice-over forebodingly divulges a tale; ""Heard about the guy who fell off a skyscraper? On his way down past each floor, he kept saying to reassure himself: So far so good... so far so good... so far so good. How you fall doesn't matter. It's how you land!"" Throughout the day the three have constant run-ins with police; some trying to keep the boys out of trouble, some just doing their jobs, and some abusing their power. It's easy to see how things will land.But to summarize La Haine as a story about men making bad decisions and getting punished for it would be selling the filmmakers short. The movie expands to explore the nature of violence and how it can inhabit minds. Furthermore it explores how poverty, and racism can coax violence from people. The characters are all minorities living in a country that is passively and symbolically racist towards them. They feed off of the violence depicted in popular entertainment and are incensed by the police brutality around them. Yet they have nowhere to release their frustrations. ""Hate breeds hate,"" the sensible Hubert explains as Vinz pumps himself up for possible homicide. It's important to note that much like the Projects of Chicago or New York, the banlieues of Paris are apportioned largely by differences in income distribution and extreme racial segregation. While Said and Vinz would under other circumstances be religiously in conflict, because of their minority status, they interact with the world at large in tandem.Like Things Fall Apart, La Haine follows the same tragic hero outline that certainly doesn't end with rays of sunshine. Still the raw acting talent exhibited by the cast, the stylish bare-bones directing by Matthieu Kassovitz and, above all biting social commentary, makes this film a must watch. I'll leave you with the first part of William Yeat's poem for which the title of Things Fall Apart is based off of which seems apropos:Turning and turning in the widening gyreThe falcon cannot hear the falconer;Things fall apart; the centre cannot hold;Mere anarchy is loosed upon the world,The blood-dimmed tide is loosed, and everywhereThe ceremony of innocence is drowned;The best lack all conviction, while the worstAre full of passionate intensity.http://theyservepopcorninhell.blogspot.com/",La Haine
42,Sergeant_Tibbs,"""La Haine""; Mathieu Kassovitz' stark social study of violence, fear and hatred, remains the powerful masterpiece it was in '95.",10,6 August 2007,"In 1995, Mathieu Kassovitz wrote and directed a film that showed the controversial truth; ""La Haine"", which translates to ""Hate"", a film deemed so important the then-prime minister Alain Juppé arranged a special screening and ordered his entire cabinet to watch the film. Kassovitz rightfully won the Best Director award at the Cannes festival for his film that had and still has a huge impact on French society. La Haine mixes ethnics to emphasise the overriding importance of solidarity against the police. In my opinion, the greatest film ever made. A cinematic phenomenon so close to my heart.It is the day after the riots on an underclass French estate (the film opens with real footage of riots with the suitable soundtrack of Bob Marley's Burnin' and Lootin'). A youth named Abdel had been caught and beaten by the police and is now in critical condition. One of his very best friends, Vinz (Jewish), had found a cop's weapon. He swears that if Abdel dies he will kill a cop. The majority of the film revolves around Vinz and his two other friends Hubert (Afro-Caribbean) and Saïd (North African) roaming around their ghetto and suburbs of Paris. Set just within 24 hours, this is just a glimpse of the chaos.There is an image in La Haine where Vinz (Vincent Cassel) imitates Travis Bickle (Taxi Driver) in the mirror; ""You talking' to me?"" and then points his fingers like a gun and fires. This is not an action he only does once as he repeats it twice during the film. But why? He has a gun. Is this preparation? Yes. Vinz has to prepare because he is scared. And he has to see what it looks like, to make sure it looks ""cool"", as when he does kill a cop, he will get an undeserved respect by his peers. There is another scene in which Vinz and Hubert bump into a cop while trying to run from this. Vinz' first instinct is to pull the gun on him, this shows that the first instinct has now become violence. The reaction to violence is fear (which is apparent in the cops face until Hubert knocks him out). Fear creates hate; or, the thought and idea of hate. Like the youths feel they are supposed to hate the cops. Vinz is the angriest central character, but when he had his chance, he hesitates; consequences are not forgotten. Cassel performs Vinz with brute force, not failing to portray his character for a second.Hubert (Hubert Koundé), the most subtle character in the film, remains quiet and gentle, although he is a boxer; or a fighter; for the majority of the film. He has a longing to escape. He has no idea who to trust. Everyone is a thug. This is the stereotype that has been created. But not even a thug wants this thought about them. He is always watching the hatred breed around him but never takes part. But when it comes to the cut, the action and reaction is always the same and he proves himself wrong. Koundé put a lot of effort into his role and earns his praise.Saïd (Saïd Taghmaoui); possibly the most vibrant character of the three, feels as if he has to be something, he hates change but he follows the crowd, he wants to be accepted. He appears to be everybody's friend as he constantly makes jokes. This is because his family is dead so Vinz and Hubert; and possibly Abdel but we don't know since we only ever hear about Abdel, so they are basically his family. But if they get into trouble they wouldn't hesitate to leave each other. It's every man for himself. Cassel, Koundé and Taghmaoui work so well together its as if they have known each other for years.The youths are stuck on the idea that the cops are there to stop them, and they refuse the idea that the cops are there in fact to protect them. And the youths express hatred with violence. Sexual intercourse is not an issue in this society as it is too dangerous to have a girlfriend, as it will spawn more violence, thus more hatred. La Haine does not offer solutions to all the racism but in fact, shows you in a detailed and mature manner.Starkly shot in black and white; La Haine has one of my favourite cinematography works. Kassovitz directional style is so inspirational, using rocketing zooms and smooth swerves to get the full view of the destruction. Popular hip hop music is used and heard throughout the film, none of it I would listen to unless I was watching La Haine. The film shows a side of France you can not find on a tourist map. Passion, dedication and effort was well put forward to La Haine. It punches you in the face with its sheer, raw intensity.The films most important quote is the one it opens and shuts with: - ""Heard about the guy who fell off a skyscraper? On his way down past each floor, he kept saying to reassure himself: So far so good... so far so good... so far so good. How you fall doesn't matter. It's how you land!"". This directly reflects the films content, structure and result. La Haine proves that hatred is in fact the strongest emotion. One of the greatest films of the 90s and of all-time; if there was one perfect film; it would be La Haine.10/10",La Haine
43,Takethispunch,Wow,10,5 January 2017,"The film depicts approximately 19 consecutive hours in the lives of three friends in their early twenties from immigrant families living in an impoverished multi-ethnic French housing project (a ZUP – zone d'urbanisation prioritaire) in the suburbs of Paris, in the aftermath of a riot. Vinz (Vincent Cassel), who is Jewish, is filled with rage. He sees himself as a gangster ready to win respect by killing a cop, manically practising the role of Travis Bickle from the film Taxi Driver in the mirror secretly. His attitude towards police, for instance, is a simplified, stylized blanket condemnation, even to individual policemen who make an effort to steer the trio clear of troublesome situations. Hubert (Hubert Koundé) is an Afro-French boxer and small-time drug dealer, the most mature of the three, whose gymnasium was burned in the riots. The quietest, most thoughtful and wisest of the three, he sadly contemplates the ghetto and the hate around him. He expresses the wish to simply leave this world of violence and hate behind him, but does not know how since he lacks the means to do so. Saïd – Sayid in some English subtitles – (Saïd Taghmaoui) is an Arab Maghrebi who inhabits the middle ground between his two friends' responses to their place in life.",La Haine
44,frankde-jong,"A very bleak view on living in a ""banlieu"" near Paris",8,25 July 2020,"""La haine"" (Hate) tells the story of youth in a poor neighborhood (i.e a ""banlieu"" near Paris) and their violent youth culture.The film has nothing to do with ""West side story"" (1961, Robert Wise), which is much more romantic. The closest comparison may be ""Do the right thing"" (1989, Spike Lee). ""Do the right thing"" portrays the 24 hours before a riot in New York, ""La haine"" portrays the 24 hours after a riot in Paris. Even ""Do the right thing"" however is, as a comedy, more lighthearted than the desperate world in ""La haine"". ""La haine"" feels like a bleak version of Italian neo realism 50 years later.""La haine"" has not a real plot. We follow the main characters Hubert (Hubert Koundé), Vinz (Vincent Kassel) and Saïd (Saïd Taghmaoui) during 24 hours. A significant part of this 24 hours is spent in boredom. The only real tension is represented by a police pistol that a cop has lost and Vinz has found. Is he going to use it? In this way this pistol is a metaphor for the ""banlieu"" as a social ticking time bomb. The ticking is also interwoven in the sountrack. Each time the time of day (or night) is given in an intertitle we hear the sound of a ticking clock.""La haine"" is filmed in black and white and this captures perfectly the bleak mood of the film. The film also contains a few interesting filmquotes. In the beginning of the film Vinz gives an imitation before the mirror of the famous ""Are you talking to me? "" performance of Robert de Niro in ""Taxi driver"" (1976, Martin Scorsese). Later in the film a teenager places his music amplifier before the open window and gives a ""stratching"" performance. It reminds of the music Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins) plays for his fellow inmates in ""The Shawshank redemption"" (1994, Frank Darabont).Finally, there are two features that are noteworthy about ""La haine"". In the first place the limited role of racism in the film. The three main characters are Black (Hubert), Jewish (Vinz) and Islamic (Saïd), but there is not a trace of racism among them. They are not fighting against a different group of the population (as in ""West side story"") but against the state as represented by the cops (called ""pigs"" in the slang of the neighborhood). In the second place women / girls play a very minor role in the film. Asked about this director Kassovitz reponded that he did not want to dilute the story with a romance. Giving this answer he might have tought about ""The West side story"", but of course a girl can play a different (more active) role than being the love interest of a boy.",La Haine
45,film-critic,How can a film made in the 90s still resonate in the 00s? Ask Kassovitz!,9,30 November 2009,"""La Haine"" is a political film. ""La Haine"" is a humanistic film about the realities of ghetto life. ""La Haine"" is a film about France, specifically the turmoil surrounding rebellion, honesty, and sacrifice. ""La Haine"" will anger you. It will make you cringe in your seat. It will make you question the values within your own community. That is why this film swept in 1995 when it was released, why other directors have attempted to recycle the story, and why even today - 14 years later - it still remains a relevant film, not just about French society, but a dedicated relevance towards American society as well. Director Mathieu Kassovitz has pulled this story directly from the headlines, taking the injustice of the police and the corruption of the streets and transforming it into the lives of three multi-national boys hell-bent on initiating revenge for the sake of their fallen friend. It is a dark story that uses drugs and violence off the scene to build the suspense within. Filmed in a stark black and white, Kassovitz takes away the glory, wealth, and American-ized culture of project life (see Baltimore's ""The Wire"") and allows us to experience one day in the life of these boys and their discovery of a gun.Like von Trier's ""Dear Wendy"", ""La Haine"" focuses on the gun, a rarity within the youth of the French projects, and builds this momentum that the unknown will eventually happen. This onset of violence, which has been haunting us throughout the film, a la ""Mean Streets"", finally comes face forward in our third act in a shock provoking scene that will rattle you each time ""La Haine"" visits your DVD player. Yet, this is just a small indication of what ""La Haine"" has to offer. Yes, it is a film about violence, it is a political film, and you better believe that it is a youth film, but there is something universal about this mid-90s film that continues to resonate with each viewing. For me, it rests powerfully on the actors. Vincent Cassel absolutely steals this film. From his opening dance, until the unique dilemma surrounding the skinhead, he proves throughout this film that he was passionate about the material. For those doubting the power of his ability, see his body language, emotion, and intensity behind his words - what Cassel does in this film is rare in today's Oscar-caliber films. I recently had the opportunity to watch his film, ""Eyes Wide Shut"" - again, another independent film in which he gave over 100% of his ability to bring to the screen a genuinely unique character. That is the ability of Vincent Cassell. Yet, in ""La Haine"", we have two other players that bring even more of a dynamic to this group. Hubert Kounde's performance of Hubert is jaw-dropping. There is this subtle level of intelligence that rounds out our group consisting of himself, the wild-card, and the jokester. Hubert shows that life in the ghettos of France are not just a status symbol, but instead merely abilities to get by. When selling drugs, the money doesn't go towards jewelery or cars, it goes back to his mother to pay the gas bill. In this scene alone, Hubert shows his humanity, while Kassovitz demonstrates the truth behind the scene. Said was equally as good, keeping up with the other two, but for myself, Hubert and Vinz were our stand out roles. They played against themselves so much, that the two of them became closer as the film progressed.Watching Criterion's release of this film, it is impressive how much they put together for this double-disc set. The interview with Jodie Foster is a bit long, but interesting. She talks about her first impressions of the film, and her excitement about bringing ""La Haine"" to the US of A. While it showed a different side to Paris, the universality of the message Kassovitz was trying to bring to the screen; youth's anger towards leaders, corruption within the police, and unnecessary casualties of protest is still relevant here today. Albeit, the language is different - the message is the same. Kassovitz's audio commentary is a political one, occasionally discussing how the scene was created and the shortfalls of creating a independent film, he talks in length to his experiences within the ghetto, and the truth behind the police in France (as well as its leaders). He also interestingly enough, talks about his influences on this film, and throughout his career. Obviously, you can see the Scorsese references throughout (see ""Taxi Driver""), but he talks in length about ""Mean Streets"", and how that film spoke to him more than any other big-budget Hollywood film he had seen. Included on the second disc are plenty of behind the scene moments as well as extended and deleted scenes that further demonstrate Kassovitz's ability, and how he transformed this color film, into a cinematic triumph.Overall, I love ""La Haine"", but be forewarned. This is not a ""sit-down-on-a-Saturday-with-some-friends-and-a-beer"" film. This is a thought-provoking slice of international cinema that demonstrates amazing actors in their craft, a film with a message, and a director who had little to work with, but used what he had with artistic talent. ""La Haine"" will remain with you long after the short credits roll, the shock of the ending will make you jump again and again (no matter the amount of times seen), and the discussion to follow remains a pivotal part to this film. I cannot watch this film back to back, but when I come across a need to experience cinema as it should be created, ""La Haine"" will be the first to come to mind. Impressive.Grade: ***** out of *****",La Haine
46,ElijahCSkuggs,"The ghetto, graffiti, and a gun.",8,4 May 2008,"An intense black and white look into the underbelly of Paris, three youths from the projects are the center of attention in this memorable French film called ""La Haine."" Taking place over 24 fateful hours, the youths, Vinz, a Jew (Vincent Cassell), Hubert, an African(Hubert Kounde), and Said, an Arab (Said Taghmaoui) all come from differing backgrounds, but the trio, as unlikable as they occasionally are, share a few common bonds: disdain for the police, marijuana, and girls.After riots scorch the projects, a friend of theirs is beaten by corrupt police and claims an explosive Vinz: if their friend dies, a cop dies in his place.The film is a very personal and vivid look into the poor and desperate side of Paris, and for all its worth, the film succeeds in drawing you in, making you shake your head, laugh a bit, and wonder what these youths actually want to accomplish.Like I mentioned earlier, the main characters aren't very likable.

I watched this when i was at the age of the characters in the movie back around the time the film was released here, and was amazed & startled by its rawness. I was just there at the right age for this in that era.There is little comparable to this movie. There have been many others films (especially from the US) centering on dejection, loss, frustration and anger in the urban youth in the estate projects/schemes, but no other film has been as confrontational and as realistic as this one. Probably doesn't matter where you come from, this film will resonate with so many across the globe.We have the France that is not the vineyards or high culture, but the real people on the ground from across national backgrounds. Our three leads are from differing faiths & ethnicities but it's no issue, they are loyal friends.The filming of watching these three leads in a post-riot day of reckoning is visually very stark. You are engrossed as you watch them battle their way through the day, although they're no angels themselves. Then there's the big moral conundrum: violent revenge.This is a film that can really make teach you a lot in your formative years. There are genuine criticisms to make of the film in areas, but the key points it is trying to relate, especially the one on revenge, overwhelm any concerns that critics may have.Even after a generation, it's as poignant as ever. It's a cliche to say ""more relevant now than ever"" but really there is always a time when a film like this has relevance to sections of society.A wonderful, hard hitting movie that I think is a genuine classic, and really I can't help recommend this enough.",La Haine

After a crazy riot that went last night, the teenagers spend their day messing around with everybody. The movie is full with cinematic techniques such as over the shoulder cameras moves, close ups, characters looking straight at the camera (not breaking the fourth wall, that's something different). A true cinematic masterpiece not only by story but also by cinematic expression. The most important moment of the film is when the teenagers ran into an old man in the toilets, the man starts telling them a story of his past in which the message is to not always go after your intentions, not always go after your ideology. Some things are worth to keep for yourself. Great performance, great director. Even though the movie is from 1995, it has a clear image of humanity's hate towards each other and how these things keep happening.",La Haine

54,avik-basu1889,Life in the Ghetto !!!,8,12 June 2015,"La Haine is a political film directed by Mathieu Kassovitz which deals with the constant riots in the projects of France. It focuses on three young boys living in the suburbs and follows them for a few hours during one particularly chaotic day when one of their friends, a protester by the name of Abdel gets critically assaulted by the police.Kassovitz successfully manages to capture the feel and the bleak nature of life in these projects. The conditions that the boys of the neighbourhoods grow up in are completely unsuitable for children and the violence and chaos existing all around them after a point engulf them all whether they like it or not. Gyms getting damaged, schools getting burnt down and constant fighting with the police are part and parcel of the lives in these ghettos. Vinz, Said and Hubert are boys who also during their lives have been exposed to this violence and as a result they have also become violent, although Hubert is the most sensible among them. They constantly feel the need to act like badasses just to prove that they are brave and bigshots, although they are all boys who are pretending to be something they are not. The direction is stylish. The film is in black and white. A reason for that might be to show the hopeless nature of life in these projects where colour as a symbol of hope has not entered. Mathieu Kassovitz uses fast zooms, Raging Bull-esque slow motion and some other techniques which work well.The screenplay for the most part works well and I remained engaged. But during the last 30 minutes the story sort of lost its way a bit and lost the intensity that made everything that came before very captivating and the climax felt a bit contrived.The acting is very good and every one looks natural and at ease in front of the camera. Vincent Cassel deserves a special mention.La Haine is a very good film depicting the hardships that come along with living in the ghetto. While it may not be perfect, it certainly does manage to provoke the viewer to think about the world at large.",La Haine
55,Bogey Man,Great achievement. One of the most unforgettable Euro movies of the 90's.,10,17 May 2002,"La Haine aka Hate is a story about three friends living near Paris in France (one Jew, one Arab and one black) who have nothing special in their lives and try to live a day at a time by drinking and having a good time and also working (at least the black character, who owns a boxing hall). Their friend, however, is captured by a police which tortures and maltreats him so badly that he is sent to a hospital in a critical condition. This makes the youth gangs in city including the three protagonists start a war against the police and authorities for the horrible wrongs they and their friend have suffered, and suddenly they notice the whole society is collapsing, and all there is is hate and need to revenge...Violence and mayhem is almost everywhere, including authorities which should do nothing but fight against it..This film is powerful and grim. Totally unforgettable is the last scene which at my first viewing time blew me away. It comes very suddenly and there are no warnings what will happen at the end of this film. The message is so important and these marks of the ""apocalypse"" can be found in our everyday life everywhere. The society is falling and it is ""spinning"" as the voice over says just before the end credits..The film brings into question such horrific facts as racism which should have passed away long times ago, but no. Racism is such a primitive, stupid and despisable cancer among people, that there is no hope of better future if individuals don't understand the real facts of life and right ways to live with each other. Hate feeds hate as the character Hubert says, and that is something that our stupid race has not learned.There is one very powerful scene just before the end scene and it deals with a skinhead and these three characters who could kill him right away and pay something back. It is very challenging scene and even Vinz, the most revenge seeking character, starts to see things different way after that. The whole point of La Haine is violence in all its forms. Why there is violence and why the hell it is used so often everywhere in every form? Don't we ever learn? These kind of films are important and so powerful that unfortunately people who should see them don't want to or they can't bacause it would be as a mirror for them..The film is also a comment on power used by police as they are pretty tough and hard in this film. Police think that they can use any methods in order to get some answers, or in order to have some fun..It certainly doesn't judge police as ""pigs"" or violent sadists in general, but it is a warning example of what must NOT happen anywhere ever, by police or by others. One has to see through the film and to its core in order to understand what it says. Otherwise there is no point in watching these kind of films. La Haine is that kind of a film that it should be seen by police and youths as well, because there are still possibilities to prevent things to go too far in our life and world we live in.The camera techniques used in this film are magnificent. Director/screenwriter Mathieu Kassovitz uses camera so smoothly and passionately and there are many similarities in techniques between this film and his more recent, Assassin(s). I am very happy for this young talent to have won the director's award at Cannes. These kind of talents deserve their prizes because there are so many stupid and worthless films which don't have nothing artistic in them and have nothing to say, and are just mindless and greedy entertainment. The black and white is very great element and the film strikes greatly without colors. The same case is with the Belgian classic Man Bites Dog, by Remy Belvaux, Benoit Poelvoorde and Andre Bonzel.
A great masterpiece in French modern cinema and recommended for the fans of intelligent and important cinema so seldom found from big studios or Hollywood (there are exceptions, of course) nowadays.10/10",La Haine

Except for their bravery, they rarely take the initiative to attack other people except the police, even if they are extremely extreme. disdainful. They also have a lot of cowardice in the face of the police pursuit, they are also fleeing, and when they are caught, they also try their best to suppress their emotions. Even after holding the gun against the little bastard's head and trembling and struggling, he still lowered the muzzle rationally. If there is no policeman in the end, the shot of the policeman is just a gesture of gestation and fantasy in his mind.

57,alainenglish,Vivid depiction of urban life,9,22 June 2007,"This is a gripping foreign-language picture famous for peering behind the tourist facade to show the real face of Paris. It is set in the suburbs and working class projects of the French capital, but in fact the tale feels familiar to almost any city: that of lost youths with no lives to look forward to striking back at the system that contains them.In fact the Paris depicted here has a lot in common with the likes of Glasgow or Edinburgh in Scotland: places of high culture that are also afflicted with a deep-rooted economic poverty and rampant inner-city violence. The explosive riots, the general alienation of the characters when they explore the rich end of the big city. There is also the intrusion, as there is in this country, of the nosey middle-class media types who patronise the working-class world by trying to document it on camera as a slice of 'real-life'. An fractious encounter between the locals of the suburbs and a group of TV journalists captures this exactly.I enjoyed the realism of the narrative, and the casual, natural banter of all of the actors. I don't know how much more (or how less) effective the film would be if shot in colour, but the black-and-white cinematography does the job and conveys the grittiness of the surroundings.There are no pleas for sympathy here or any sentimental twists designed to manipulate the viewer. People and events are depicted just as they are, and it is the raw simplicity of ""La Haine"" which makes it a compelling and highly watchable picture.",La Haine

I will give it full marks to it for being what it is, and I have no complaint whatsover. But people have made this what this was not intended to be.I will make it easy. Most of the film is only dialogues. Now, dialogue writing is a really tough job, specially when you have two hours at hand and that too without any major storyline. Scripting is really good. Though almost nothing happens during the entire screentime, it never feels stretched.Problem is when people call this a 'political commentry'. It's not a story about racism, or police torture or just anything. It's just about 24 hours in three men's life. Does this whole film have any hard hitting substory or just a single scene where conveys or suggests something. Does Vinz's fantasies have anything to do with the film. I know it tells more about the character , but, was it needed at first. It is a kind if film where there is no need to have a unique character.I would rate it as a really good film.

64,nicolechan916,An intense atmosphere and story with good acting.,7,12 October 2015,"I find it interesting that the film uses the names of most the actors as their character names. Perhaps by doing so, it adds more of an authentic feel to the film. The trio (Vincent, Hubert and Said) have good chemistry on screen, and what really ties them together is Said, as Vincent and Hubert are constantly butting heads; one the angel and the other the devil. Said plays the cheerful innocent young boy without much of a care and does not take sides with either, trying to maintain the peace. Vincent's expressions are really intense and though he does talk of violent acts, he does not engage in many. Hubert thinks of the bigger picture and with his calm demeanour is the image of morality in the film. The trio can be seen as gangsters by the way they walk and talk and the influence of American hood films is apparent here.This film is in black and white and that makes the atmosphere constant throughout. It has this bleak tone to it, and can even be seen as Expressionistic for both its visual style and narrative. The film expresses social issues in France at the time, and this film greatly portrays that. Set in a time when the citizens were conditioned to fear and despise the police, Kassovitz impressively shows both police brutality and sympathy.The cinematography is noticeably appreciable as well. There is this one scene, where I had to rewind to appreciate it some more. This is when Vinz is in the bathroom acting all macho, and testing out his toughness in front of the mirror. We are led to believe that we see him through the mirror, but then the camera should be in the reflection too, and it is not. That is truly ingenious.Though the film did keep me quite engaged, I just felt that it was a bit heavy for me, and that it wasn't leading anywhere. Then the ending came and it was just so unexpected that it left me feeling empty. Not sure how I feel about that.Read more movie reviews at: championangels.wordpress.com",La Haine

I mean, the title is literally just ""hate"".In some ways this is another one of those ""nothing"" films I happened to watch a few of all at once a few months ago and didn't really care much for, but this one has by far the most purpose to being structured that way out of any of them. You feel every bit of the anger and agonizing wait that the characters do, because the genius thing about this film is that those characters desperately want this to be a nothing film.They go around doing all the things they would normally do, but inevitably, all that rage is going to come out somehow, and man is it intense when almost every new scene makes you wonder if this'll be that moment.There's so many great shots in it too, and it's such a shame that this director hasn't really done anything else that's all that well known, but I couldn't possibly believe that that's just because he hasn't made anything else that's at least good.I guess the one thing I could maybe complain about is that the pacing may be a little slow in some scenes, but that could easily improve on a rewatch, and even if it doesn't, everything else is so perfect that it's that rare film that I feel like I don't even need to consider whether or not it deserves a 10/10.Jusqu'ici tout va bien...",La Haine

This is France's answer to Scorsese and Spike Lee. ""This is the story about a guy who falls off the top of a 50 storey building(or the Eiffel Tower),"" recounts one of the film's heros.""As he is falling, he is telling himself,'So far, everything is fine....so far, everything is fine' But in the end he has to land."" Kassovitz tells the story of that descent through 24 hours in the lives of three friends, a symbolic trio of Black, Arab and Jew. Hubert, Said and Vinz are homeboys for whom home is one of the countless suberbs outside Paris, The housing estates, shoe boxes or pigeon holes if you ask me. They are members of that singularly exclusive class which Presisent Chirac labelled les exclus: unemployed drifters who hang out, get high, steal the odd car, deal the odd deal. Their friend Abdel is on death's door after being beaten during a police interrogation, a night of rioting has ensued and now the cite is in a state of siege. And now it is Vinz not the Cops who have the gun, lost by one of the riot police during the insurgence. Stumbling upon it has transformed atimid teenager who ""feels like an ant lost in an intergalactic space"" into a swaggering Titan, rumescent with power, a rebel with, at last, a cause. This is black and white cinematography, bursting with rhythm, almost schizophrenic in its scope, this is La Haine and a hugely effecting film it is. Frozen in boredom and slow motion shots of Hubert hitting a punching bag, all gleaming sweat. An accelerated montage of the frantic mob backed by Bob Marley's music that turns banal televised violence into a massive mournful, comunal dance. the rappers do a different kind of dance, and the camera ups the tempo chasing jumps and pirouettes of such energy and artistry that seem to resurrect a thousand lost hopes. edgily it follows that the three friends who play, joke and provoke because although they are street wise, finally they are only boys and there jokes are about farting and sex. the gags dry up when the boys arrive in Paris. The city's famed charms are lost on them, they are hopelessly alien as the hordes of American tourists, scorned by the girls they try to pull and finally brutalized by a sadistic interrogation officer whose hard-on swells with every blow. The screen screen fills up with a terrible close-up of a face rabid with hatred. It is Vinz, tentatively, fondling the ever present gun, its a chrome-plated Smith and Wesson 44. Vinz is hallucinating about using it on the next cop he passes by. Vinz at the movies, holding up his face to raining images of violence, inviting them to drown him and at the same time empower him. Vinz and a recurring mirage: a lone cow grazing in the cite's concrete fields. In the end, it is Hubert - the trio's voice of reason, the mediator, the one with the most tolerance and faith and the greatest moral sense - who is most inhabited by hatred. the gun is in his hands.

There must be conviction in such words and the characters in ""La Haine"" seem to know they're in such dire circumstances, which are presented to us as almost inescapable for them.The french film, which took home the César Award for Best Film in 1995, succeeds in its sense of realism, almost appearing as a documentary with incredibly subtle camera-work that allows us to, not so much participate in but rather, feel shameful for unobtrusively playing witness to the crimes. The cinematography specifically is an absolute treat to the eye, with innovative shots and angles to seamlessly truck the story along in an engaging fashion.The grainy cinematography paints the inner city as a place of cold emptiness and savagery. Its beautiful from a distance, though embodying an ugliness at its core that its characters persistently find themselves in the middle of. The atmosphere's harsh lighting and expressionist style of cinematography bears a striking similarity to the classic noir film, ""The Third Man"", where the surroundings are so vibrant that they nearly become a character in itself.Director Kassovitz, in only his second feature, demonstrates a masterful understanding of space and shadows, creating feelings of distress, at times claustrophobia, and a general sense of uneasiness. He uses quick edits during violent scenes and shows a willingness to employ some longer shots during the film's quieter moments, which help let the surroundings and reality of it all sink in a bit for the viewer.

71,crculver,"Dealing with a side of French society that was hitherto ignored, this is a memorable film",8,17 July 2015,"Matthieu Kassowitz's LA HAINE (Hate) is a portrait of youth disenfranchisement and the ensuing rage set in the public housing projects outside Paris. Before this film was released, many foreign viewers knew only the well-dressed, white, reserved and educated France depicted in e.g. films of the 1960s New Wave. Even many French people were unaware of the darker undercurrents of their own society, as no film had dared to handle this subject matter before. LA HAINE was a bombshell. While shot in 1995, it remains entirely topical today, as riots have continued to make the news in recent years.LA HAINE follows one day in the lives of three young men of different ethnic backgrounds all born and raised in one particular housing project: the aggressive Jew Vinz (Vincent Cassell), the insecure, clownish Arab Saïd (Saïd Taghmaoui) and the more level-headed, pensive sub-Saharan African Hubert (Hubert Koundé). The film opens on a spring morning, in the aftermath of a riot which has rocked these youths' housing project. Some cars and buildings are destroyed, and the news reports that a police officer has lost his gun in the chaos of the night before. During the 24-hour period before the film's shocking ending, this trio tours the bittersweet environment of their housing project (violence and poverty on one hand, loving families on the other) and, in an effort to pick up money owed to them, they navigate the alien environment (rich, educated, white) of downtown Paris.This is not only a revelatory film in showing viewers a side of France they had never seen before, but it is also extremely entertaining. The performances by these relatively unexperienced actors are totally convincing, Vincent Cassell in particular. Kassowitz shuns his country's own film tradition and instead sculpts the action under inspiration from the USA. However, the ""urban"", ""hip-hop"" aesthetic he employs does not lower the film to the more vacuous Hollywood productions but instead is at the level of Spike Lee and Scorsese. The director's decision to print the film in black and white has imbued it with a gravitas that makes it timeless. That said, in spite of the fine acting and ethnographic detail, the plot itself is rather mundane, which holds me back from giving this a full five stars.",La Haine
72,danielharden,Hate breeds Hate,8,7 October 2016,"Have you heard of the story of the man falling from the skyscraper? As he falls he reassures himself repeating, ""So far so good... So far so good... So far so good."" But it's not the fall that matters. First time film maker Mathieu Kassovitz writes and directs the controversial tale of three residents of the French housing estate La Banlieues. These residents represent three different ethnic and religious backgrounds. We have Vinz, the aggressive young man of Jewish descent, Said, an Arabian man whose power comes from his graffiti vandalism. And Hubert, the boxer and voice of reason of African descent who may stand a chance of escaping the poverty and criminal lifestyle residents of La Banlieue resort to.The film is a-day-in-the-life of three La Banlieue residents. The narrative reflects this as it essentially is just three friends hanging out but engaging in criminal activity, anti social behaviour and being targets for police brutality. By having a-day-in-the-life narrative it brings a real sense of reality as events take place rather realistically while also acting as powerful statements about the state of France and the professionalism of French police at the time. Kassovitz perfectly creates scenes highlighting the disenfranchisement of youth, the class division, the anti youth bias of the media and conflict in France as well as the abuse of power from French law enforcement. Scenes like; the Opening, the interrogation scene and the unforgettable closing scene.Kassovitz's direction is fantastic as he portrays the isolation and alienation of the disenfranchised youth of La Banlieue. Specific moments that deserve mentioning is Hubert and DJ Killa scene. Kassovitz definitely earned his Canne film festival award for best director that year for this film. His writing is also great at creating characters that people can relate to and that feel real. This is also in part down to the great acting from leads, Vincent Cassel, Hubert Kounde and Said Taghmaoui. Their on screen chemistry feels extremely authentic and you believe that these three people from three different backgrounds but bonded under one political issue are able to become friends rather than breed the hate further.Overall, La Haine is a brilliantly directed, written and acted film about poverty, power and conflict in Paris and La Banlieue, highlighting that their is a problem that needs to be addressed. 20 years on and the issues in La Haine are still very much issues and so La Haine's messages and representations are still very accurate and relevant to this day. Kassovitz does a fantastic job with his debut as he tells the audience and French authorities to open their eyes as french society is falling, but it isn't the fall that matters.

78,ihrtfilms,shocking relevant and at times funny.,6,6 July 2010,"This is one of those high impact films that I remember watching when I was younger. I don't think I've seen it for at least 10yrs. I barely remember it, but I thought it was a lot more violent and shocking. Yet on a new viewing, I find it too be perhaps less shocking and full of humour. Despite the storyline of riots and violence, the three characters are just regular guys when it comes down to it, they are just caught up in far from perfect world. They are, between run-ins with the police very entertaining: Said trying to get his hair trimmed was hilarious, his voice raising ever higher as he panics about how much has been shaved: The three guys trying to steal a car, with the aid of a drunk passer by are fine and funny moments. But these lighter interludes are shattered by hints of dire things to come. The cops roughing up Said and Hubert is horrid to watch and as the film progresses you can feel a sense of doom coming closer. The encounter with the skinheads for me was the moment you know the ending was not going to be good and then boom. It takes a lot for me to physically feel something from a film, but as that gun fired into Vinz, I shivered. The ending alone is enough to put it into that high impact category, but as a whole it is a still relevant piece about social conditions and the suffering caused by them.More of my reviews at my site iheartfilms.weebly.com",La Haine
79,butchfilms,Good performances in this regular film,6,31 January 2009,"I thought this was going to be a better film because this movie sometimes gets in the top 250 IMDb but I think people give it a high rating because of its performances instead of the movie itself which is entertaining but just regular in my opinion.The performances of the three leading actors are really good who look like real housing project's teenagers with problems and confusions common of their age;the plot is good, I liked also that it was filmed in black and white. What I didn't like so much was how it was developed, sometimes it looked like a documentary, and there were parts that I found a little naive and boring.Vinz is a problematic teenager who lives in a housing project and has in his possession a gun and he is always saying to his closest friends that he wants to kill a cop in revenge because one of his friends was hurt very bad by one policeman.I recommend to watch this movie specially for the performances of Vincent Cassel and Saïd Taghmaoui.

80,Det_McNulty,"A Film Executed With Bare-Knuckled Force, Dynamically Examining How Hate Breeds Hate and Remaining Extremely Relevant For Today's Society",9,27 May 2007,"La Haine, when translated to English quite literally means ""hate"", and just from this title you know straight away the kind of film La Haine is. Inspired by other masterpieces such as, Do the Right Thing and Mean Streets, La Haine is a French film taking influence from American, urban cinema. Just like the two films I have previously mentioned, La Haine is a ferocious film, fuming with a controlled rage which will resonate for hours after your viewing. To this day, I can still vividly recollect my first-viewing of La Haine. I was completely taken-a-back by the experience and left in awe at what I had just viewed. Not only this, but I quickly realised I had watched one of the most poignant social-commentaries to hit modern cinema, a film which was so honest and reminiscent for today's society.Set within the space of a day, La Haine places the viewer inside the French ghettos. The film quickly centres itself around three protagonists who have little-to-nothing in prospects as they grow up on a working-class council estate. The film is set around the day after a huge riot, whereby the three teenagers and police become subjected to a boiling tension, after their friend was hospitalised from the police brutality of the riot the night before.La Haine is not a glamorous film, nor does endeavour to make its characters seem admirable; rather it puts a social-dilemma into a perspective which enables you to feel empathy for ""thugs"". La Haine pressurises the viewer undergo and endure a study of social-class, and how an environment has a significant affect on the way a person behaves in life and one's morals. The film requires you to concentrate on acknowledging why these young people behave in the way they do. Highlighting many social-dilemmas, La Haine does not stray away from depicting the deprivation of poverty-stricken ghettos. La Haine focuses on themes such as, corruption in law-enforcement, to a youth's attempt at rebelling against a flawed system. The film dwells over some of the most significantly relevant problems with today's youths.Filmed in its brutally prominent black-and-white, La Haine captures the authenticity of the urban life; bringing to light the brutality that many youths are subjected to. The black-and-white is also a wonderful metaphor for the variety of cultures combining together. The addition of Mathieu Kassovitz's gorgeously smooth camera movements captures the characters that are stuck inside an urban jungle. Ultimately, you automatically become part of the gritty environment, and an eyewitness to events which are simultaneously occurring across the globe. It is more than just ""comparatively apparent"" that Mathieu Kassovitz is horribly aware of society's decline. Plus, the confrontational editing used in La Haine is extensively affective. La Haine captures the bland and grim concrete jungle through Mathieu Kassovitz's knowledgeable vision.Just as the narrative is multi-dimensional, so are the fantastically crafted characters, which are all remarkably layered with their diverse emotions. The characters are all people you are able to pity, due to their situations in life. A Hollywood film would either make these characters appear as gangsters or despicable thugs, while La Haine makes its characters seem humane behind their thuggish appearances. Arguably these are not characters, but are instead a representation of the people that we are all surrounded by in our lives.Each character can be studied for the way in which they deal with situations and the way they feel towards the society who has deemed them of lower status. Personally, I have always felt Hubert (incredibly acted by Hubert Koundé) is the most interesting of the characters, because even when he is not delivering his lines and the camera is poised on his face, you know what he is thinking. Of the three protagonists, he is the one I consider the most sensible and mature, and is a person who feels disillusioned by the environment he is growing up around, and wants to move away from it to seek improved opportunities. As is suggested from the scene where Hubert's pregnant (subtly hinting a stereotypical portrayal of large families on a low income) mother is talking to him in the kitchen, quite possibly my favourite scene in the film.The film's centrepiece character is Vinz (brutally performed by Vincent Cassel), who is another highly interesting character, and evidently the most mentally-troubled of the film's three youths. Vincent Cassel captures the madness of his character with a remarkable ease, distancing himself from the other actors' characters. He captures the feeling of an oblivious youth without incentive, overwhelmed by his machismo, self-indulgence, anguish and rage. His intent is to be heard and not ignored, which his method of getting back on the life he has grown up in. This is a subjective view from Mathieu Kassovitz who clearly feels that the government is ignoring youths who are begging for the sympathy they deserve.Few films can hold such a strong amount of audacity and succeed in every single aspect of the piece. La Haine is bold, fearless, charismatic film-making at its best and reminds you just how dangerous society really is and a testament to excellence of French cinema.",La Haine
81,arturmachado-29588,Extremely advisable to all teenagers and young adults (and not only),7,11 August 2017,"24 hours in the lives of three young friends from the French suburbs after a violent riot the day before.Extremely advisable to all teenagers and young adults (and not only), because although the film does not have a conventional story line, being more a series of events over 24 hours, those events are things that could happen to anyone, to with which we can identify, and has a final with a deep message.It is true that the film offers no solution to the violence and problems it depicts on disadvantaged minorities and social classes, and the characters sometimes do not seem at all pleasant, but it does provide a glimpse into the human condition in how ""the social environment and behavior shape matching behavior"".I believe this is a movie that can touch the soul, a movie to reflect upon feelings and prejudices that have to be overcome if we are to have a more just and peaceful society.Truly recommendable watch.

83,PoppyTransfusion,Dedicated to the dead (major spoilers),10,6 November 2011,"The film opens with footage of actual Parisian riots and a dedication to those who died whilst the film was being made. The use of black & white photography makes the film more serious and documentary-like and more respectful to those dead whose lives the film fictionalises.The plot is very simple: a 20-hour period with 3 young disaffected men (Hubert, Said and Vinz) living in the Paris suburbs that are beset by riots after another young man (Abdel) was beaten into a coma by police. The men live in an area affected by low employment, poverty and deep distrust for the authorities. The time we spend with the characters is not without enjoyment or humour as they get into scrapes, fight amongst themselves and muse upon life and politics.Hubert is of West African origins and had boxing aspirations. He successfully campaigned for a gym on his housing estate. When we meet him his gym has been trashed by rioters and he has no intention to restore it. He is the most philosophic and reflective of the characters. He is the mouth piece for the film's main theme and title: 'if you'd been to school you would know that hatred breeds hatred'. Clearly Hubert has been to school but we learn he has also been to prison and though he longs to escape the confines of his environment he spends his time dealing in and smoking cannabis.Said is of Maghrebi origins and is the most amenable of the 3 spending his time thinking about girls, sex and defending his sister. He has dubious ways of making money and we meet one of his debtors, a sleazy man called Asterix, in a hilarious confrontation replete with guns and machismo. Said seems to be the fall guy and stooge of both Hubert and Vinz and others in their community. He is also a peacemaker whose anger is channelled into graffiti. It is he who graffitis an advert changing its slogan from 'the world is yours' to 'the world is ours', part symbol and part the political theme of the film that is gently woven throughout the drama.Vinz's origins are unclear but we learn he is Jewish. He is the most troubled of the three looking for fights with authority and warring with Hubert. Hubert suspects that Vinz was one of the rioters who trashed his gym and given Vinz's interest in killing a cop so that he can do time in prison and, therefore, earn some standing in the community, this seems a real possibility. But Vinz is not invincible (in spite of his name) and is unnerved by the cow he glimpses wandering around throughout the film. The cow is a symbol and foreshadowing of death.The film's mantra of 'life, so far, so good' we hear from Hubert in an opening story of a falling man who says over and over as he falls 'so far, so good'. But as Hubert notes it's not how you fall but how you land that matters, i.e. the consequences and the future not temporary living from hour to hour. For all their bravado and world weary cynicism the three are falling and when they land their bravado and survival instincts fail them as Vinz and then Hubert are shot in a final and fatal confrontation with the police.This film is beautifully shot; the use of black and white is stark and illuminating, giving the suburbs and its people gritty texture. Everyone is terrific in the film and the acting and dialogue seem spontaneous and natural. In fact the dialogue is so natural that one wonders how much, if any, was ad lib. I saw the film on release and several times since on DVD and it has improved with each watch. I cannot recommend this enough.",La Haine
84,Giz_Medium,"""Police violence and the rest of us""",9,2 November 2020,"History repeats itself, fiction gets back at reality and all of these others ready-made philosophies sometimes become to real to handle. reading the news on a monthly paper, and watching it as podcasts, I sometimes get a bit behind, and many of these hours get intertwined with watching or reading fiction, and there are times like last night get hard to distinguish. As a cop in cincinnati gets prosecuted for shooting a black man in the head for a traffic stop, I started watching la haine, a black & white movie set the day after a riot in a working class & migrant suburb of paris. Started after a kid from the neighborhood got sent to coma by a police beating during his custody, the story follows three young men in their day. dealing with police, with each other, with the city officials who want to calm the violence (although only the one of the rioters), but also their daily lives, in which the event of a boxing match brings them out to the city center of paris, and it's violence through more police brutality, strange interractions with white/upperclass french folks and also some nazis. the friend who recommanded it to me told me it was the only thing they knew of france politics and it also feels accurate, in the divide of french society and it's unwillingness to become inclusive outside of its assimilationist agenda. and refusal of that said assimilation is only met with the repression we see in the movie. as they say in the intro and ending, and still true twenty years later, we're still falling but it's not the fall that's important, but how we crash. we'll get there soon enough.",La Haine
85,bulleetz37235,Hate,9,11 October 2006,"It's the story of a man. He's falling from a skyscraper and all the way down as he passes each floor, he keeps saying to himself. ""So far so good, so far so good, so far so good."" how you fall doesn't matter. But it's how you land...And with this the premise is set with a trio of Parisian hoods bent on revenge for an unjustly beaten brother. Blinded by hate the three spiral in on each other looking for redemption. Each through different gains. Vinz (played by the superb Vincent Cassel) is the rough and tumble of the group, who has chanced on a loaded 44. magnum dropped by a police officer in one of the many riots taking place in their neighbourhood, which is by all correct definitions of the word - a war zone.With Sayid and Hubert in toe, he hatches his desire to gun down a cop with his own gun. To gain the highest of respect and to satisfy his rage which slowly builds throughout this one fateful day.It's quite a shattering picture. Shot in a brash black and white, and with plenty of referral to other movies.Example: Taxi Driver - Vinz in the mirror, fingers splayed like a gun... ""Are you talking to me?"" Scarface - A constant - The world is yours poster wherever they roam Raging Bull - Black n White, with boxing thrown in at some intervals. Cape Fear - Smoking cheekily in a cinema...but it ain't a thief. It's a great user of such pictures.

86,olliecurtis,A Gritty yet ineffective story,6,21 January 2021,"'Hate' is a story told in a violent manner. It is about violent people in a violent environment. But, for the first half of this film, the message didn't come across nearly as well as in the second half. One thing I do love about this film is the cinematography. It is absolutely beautiful. The acting is very good, the ending is very Scorsese-esque which can't be a bad thing. Yes it can be seen as a racially charged Taxi Driver (1976), but it has a lot more to say on how we are a product of our own environment.

87,hikerhetav,Make sure you land up meticulously before catching your seats.... watch it for sure!,8,10 July 2016,"Hate begets hate and ignorance leads to fatal. 'Hate' and 'ignorance' are two pillars of racism which we observe today while its foundation was laid far years ago. The main question arises while watching this story is, first, ""What exactly are we facing due to the effects of racism?"" and second, ""What urges us, we common people, to get trapped into the maze of racism?"" We have been living in the world of togetherness and unity with a motto of 'oneness for all', unknowingly of our society which is still diseased by the plague named 'racism'. We don't observe, while we are in our own peace, that someone superior to us is injecting a fluid in our hearts that is developing more and more hatred for the ones who are either of different casts or of different races. 'La Haine' translated as 'Hatred', directed by Mathieu Kasosvitz is very firm on the issue of racism and is by far the most occupied film ever made on the subject. The story set in the city of Paris is righteously motivated through its director and cast. Watching this, it rarely makes one feel numb and pity towards the crew; and it is as rough as it gets as emotional we feel in the end. I was stunned to see Vincent Cassel in his early days, how beautifully he has crafted his work in the form of acting. In ""Irreversible(2002)"", he was mature enough but less bold than in La Haine. Hubert and Said Taghmaoui have played their roles brilliantly. Said is another face to watch throughout the film if you enjoyed Vincent. Each of them being young, they have been so perfect and artistic, one may never find such acts in other French movies. Pierre Aim is another brain on whose shoulder, cinematography was staged. And guess, that leaves us spellbound to see very different angles of Paris. This is not all for we see this movie. We got to take something back after viewing this, we ought to apply positivity we gain from it. Because, ""the world is dying, the society around us is degrading and we are making it happen too soon.""",La Haine

90,aleksandarsarkic,A bit overrated,5,14 September 2017,"La Haine (Hate on English) is definitely one of the most known French movies from the 90s. Directed by then very young Matthieu Kassovitz it shows one day in the lives of three young people from Paris suburbs. Somehow La Haine is considered cult movie in my home country Serbia. It is popular even to this day. I think that young people from Belgrade suburbs start to identify themselves with the life of characters from the movie. It was very similar here for young people especially in the 90s but didn't changed a lot to this day. I have watched a lot of movies to my now 30 years but i always skipped La Haine and watched something else, i think that is just because the movie is popular within my country and i never trusted the taste of my fellow country-mans. And i was somehow right, i finally watched it and my impressions were half-half. I like the acting by Vincent Cassel and other actors, like the movie is recorded in black and white, but something is missing, there is no deepness in the movie, director didn't show the real reasons why the people are living in that hard conditions, we only see how they kill their time in the hood and some of their small committed crimes, and of course there is constant animosity between people from the hood and police, but maybe that's it, the feeling of emptiness is similar to hate.

91,meurernick,Other Countries Suffer from Police Brutality and Discrimination,7,2 October 2020,"First things first, I find it very intriguing that this was directed by Mathieu Kassovitz. The first thing I saw Kassovitz in, was Amélie, a very happy film to say the least. Little did I know, six years before that, he made this movie about police brutality and discrimination in France. Being from the United States, I usually do not hear about other countries' issues with the police. That may be me just not paying attention/looking in the right places, or a lack of coverage, but this opened my eyes. People in other countries deal with the same issues we deal with in the states. I think this movie was fascinating in it's symbolism of the policeman's gun. At one point, Saïd says to Vinz, ""with that piece, you're the big man in the projects"". It is a symbol of power. Also, the character change in Hubert was also very good. He started out as wanting nothing to do with the gun, to possibly being the last one to fire it in the movie.",La Haine
92,silva-w-pius,French version of Boyz N The Hood,8,11 August 2013,"Quiet possibly one of my favorite ever foreign language films and surely the rebirth of the French film industry that captivated millions around the world for so long. That's why I call this film; the French new wave part 2...To those outside France, it's the French version of Boyz N The Hood, to those in it and to myself, it's a unrestrained urban thriller that moves at such a ferocious pace, you often find yourself on the edge of your seat, clingy on to your arm rest for dear life. Mathieu Kassovitz effectively uses black and white to create art out of the all the crime and violence, mastering a fine tight rope between the rawness of a poor, urban backdrop and a piece of art work that would not look a bit out of place, if it were hung in a gallery next to painting by Picasso. Uncompromising in his attempt to tell a story loosely based on actual events, about riots that lasted for more than 10 years in the French capital, Kassovitz want to portray a story in a manner that makes the whole world stop, not only to serve as mere voyeurs, but instead to actually think.La Haine tells the story of three vastly different and conflicting characters; a Jew, an Arab and an African. That seems to come effortlessly together like a barber shop quartet. As they have to deal with the aftermath of events that lead to a young Arab teenager being beaten into a coma on the outskirts of a riot - Adding fuel to the ever growing, racial and political tension between the people in charge and the powerless individuals of the projects. While most of us feel safe watching violence, as long as it's on TV or film, as we are for the most part detached from what we are experiencing, but instead the aim of for this film, throughout the entire duration of the film, about a world that takes place in the course of one day, which is the time span in the film that seems to last a eternity, we are engrossed in the action throughout, so we are not comfortable or assured at all, instead we are almost bullied into reacting and reciprocate a feeling of tension, as is endured in the film between the cops and the residents of the project. But ultimately the underlying theme of the film is a sense of hopelessness, that is nothing will ever change! It's just a cycle. This is best represented during the opening monologue, and in the final few scenes, as a story is told and narrated, consisting of a man who jumps of a 50 story building, but to reassure himself he keeps repeating ""so far, So good, so far, So good"" as he hurtles to his death. This is used to show that this never ending cycle of violence and hate is never going to stop, soon enough resulting in society's demises. But no one seems to care. As long as they are surviving, they don't care when it's falling, but when it crashes, that's when they panic. Magnificent, awesome, a compulsive viewing! This is a poignant yet humorous reminder of the harsh reality of people living in the ghettos of France. Boyz N The Hood was a great film, but it is almost eclipsed by this masterpiece and that's saying allot. A must watch. 'The world is ours'",La Haine
93,Educhico,-,9,26 February 2021,"If the real footage in the beginning and the plot of a day in the life of these young men tries to root it in the real world, the movie itself questions the cinema language as a representation of reality to us.After Vinz has to run away, and hides himself at the movies, he lays down, completely numb to the violence being portrayed in the screen. We only hear the violence, while watching his indifferent reaction to it.And in the very next scene, we are the ones looking at the violence. Not gratuitous, not bloody, but violence nonetheless, the same type of violence that affected Abdel, the same violence that moves Vinz.
Deliberately, the director moves the camera to the position of the one watching, as if asking the audience if it's numb to it as well. Is it a reflection of our reality, or is it just a movie? ""The trick is to stop at the right moment"".As if reiterating that same point, Saïd is throughout the movie always pointing out fictional situations, that seem outrageous in their reality, that never happen here. In the end, he even stares directly at the camera, as if trying to break the fourth wall, closing his eyes, trying to break out of this reality, to escape the consequences.

Nothing is really that bad like the project kids like to think.

Because this film isn't just looking at the situation in Paris or in France it's asking what happens when a country ignores a whole mass of people. The answer is presented through our three lead characters, Vinz, Said and Hubert each from a different background but all living on the same estate in Paris. Neither of them are bad people, but with no one to guide them, the only things they are know are drugs and violence. The situation is exacerbated by the brutal actions of the police which further alienates the three from society. In fact it's kind of worrying when you think how many cities this film could be set in, London, New York, Los Angeles, Chicago, Berlin, Sydney, the list goes on.All of this is presented in just one day in the lives of these three, following a riot on their estate. Vinz is out for revenge while Hubert is trying to work his way out of the neighbourhood. The story is told more like a documentary but with some comic elements in a few places.

Virtually all people rated it a 5-star movie (the same as a 10-note movie) and said it was an impeccable masterpiece and, fail-safe. I decided to run after the movie searching to watch on YouTube (my computer is already Windows 7 and Windows 7 doesn't take more torrent) Since I didn't have it, I left it aside. I was even less willing to watch it because practically most of my friends said that it is a very dull film, a garbage superstimated by pseudo intellectual people who don't like The Shawshank Redemption or TLOTR.A while later, I found the full movie on YouTube and watched it. My expectations were high as hell, everyone spoke well of the film, he placed it among the ten favorite films, I was already telling me a real movie buff because I was watching a French film in black and white, subtitled.Overall, I found the film sensational, aesthetically awesome and technically hell yeah. But I didn't see so much specialty in acting, and it wasn't that I haven't written well, in my opinion. I couldn't find something so artistic and theatrical that would make it so good, just a personal preference. There are parts that I thought the camera was in the wrong place, and the character with forced acting. The character Hubert at the beginning of the film was very generic and without salt. Maybe I was in a bad mood when I watched it, but soon I will watch it again and maybe change my opinion.In the end, I would give this movie a solid 8/10, but that's not all they say. It is an excellent social criticism and gets more relevant with each passing year. Not to mention that the film is really well directed, cinematography is one of the most real I have ever seen, it is clear that making films outside the USA is much more difficult, especially with this attempt that had everything to go wrong, but it worked. Anyway, each with their opinion ...I know that a review like this generates discord, people saying that I am too stupid for a movie as clever and brilliant, and other things like that.",La Haine
103,KoalaBear33,Captures the ethnic friction in Paris,7,8 August 2013,"Just as relevant today as when it was made, La Haine (or Hate) captures the difficulties faced by disenfranchised youth in France. The news of rioting in France a couple of years ago made the film seem all too real. Looking back on the film, the film seems very prescient in foreshadowing the problems percolating beneath the surface in France. I imagine the economic slowdown since 2008 probably has made it even worse than what it was in the 90's.Powerful,gritty, and quite realistic portrait of contemporary France. The film is sort of a precursor to the rise of social realism in French films, with the Dardenne Brothers' works being the most successful example. The plot is a bit weak but the acting and the realism more than make up for it. Recommended for those who like social realism in films.",La Haine
104,Jozinek,An emotionally moving crime drama about a day in the life of 3 young men living in an urban hell.,9,27 March 2020,"Even days after watching this film, I still remember so much from it: the three main protagonists who share similarities (e.g. all 3 of them despise cops, referring to them as ""pigs"", they all live in extreme poverty and have a disdain for the media and the elite) as well as differences (Vinz is the most aggressive and even dreams of killing a cop, Saïd is like the child of the trio and Hubert is the most reasonable and knows where to draw the line, one time he stops Vinz from shooting a cop). Not to mention their tensions with the police, their dreadful living conditions in an almost dystopian area of Paris where crime is abundant and deadly riots have led to many places being burnt down and/or brutally vandalised (e.g. schools and a shopping mall).The atmosphere is also very well done: it's gloomy for the most part, and the black and white filter complement this. There's no soundtrack either which makes the film feel more realistic and raw. These aspects are perfect for a film that's going for a dark, gritty and realistic tone. Another thing about the black and white filter is that they could have an additional purpose other than complementing the dark atmosphere: perhaps it could be in reference to the old saying, ""the truth is black and white"" and therefore, by using this filter, the director is trying to use a visual metaphor about how his film is depicting the truth about impoverished youth in France and their relationship with the authorities. Honestly, you could interpret it in a variety of ways, same goes for other peculiar aspects of this film like Vinz' hallucinations of a cow: is he hallucinating because of his influence under drugs? Or because he is a simplistic idiot? Or maybe it's because his mental health is deteriorating? (After all, he's incredibly violent in a way that could even be deemed as unnatural). This film really makes you think, and I love that.I recommend this film to anyone studying French or for anyone who just wants to see a piece of good ol' cinematic art. However, I must add that for even those who know French fluently, watch it with subtitles, since the main characters talk in slang which can be very puzzling even for native speakers to understand at first without text.",La Haine
105,rex-10,I disagree with the comments of the other viewer,9,13 October 1998,"This is a powerful film.  Assuming as the previous commentor does, that this film demonstrates the American influence of ""life in a ghetto in Paris"" or gang life is somewhat arrogant.  Class struggle, gangs and the styles assumed by kids in Europe are not defined by the United States of America.One of the things that makes this film intriguing is the subtle uses of background props.  Consider the Escher poster in the background in one of the scenes.  This conveys a world turned upsidedown.  Early in the film we hear Vinz mention that he feels isolated and insignificant as an ant floating out in the universe.  Later we see the boys walking into the background while the camera keeps a poster of the World as seen from space in the foreground.  This is an ingenious representation visually of the idea we heard expressed earlier.There is some irony in that Jodie Foster helped bring this film to fruition. We see Vinz acting out the role of DeNiro from Taxi Driver in front of a mirror one scene.  This made me think of Jodie Foster's Army (a punk band from Phoenix) and Hinckly's assassination attempt on Reagan... are all these kids ""catcher in the rye"" types waiting for their chance to snap?  Not likely.  Regardless of these ramblings, it is a film worth seeing.",La Haine

Though I feel the characters are a little lacking, this being a film they made up as they went along, the cinematography is just brilliant if you take the time to think about it. This film gets such mixed reviews, some people love it, some people hate it. It's all just a matter of what you want to get out of a film. Some people watch films for the entertainment value, in which case you're better off watching something else, but others watch for more unique reasons. If you like to ponder the metaphorical resonances of a film, this is the one for you. If not, and you'd rather watch something for pure entertainment, maybe give La Haine a miss.

112,dodgee_69,Hard hitting French cinema,9,3 June 2005,"A hugely powerful film that encompasses everything you would expect from a film called ""hate"". Dealing with the tense situation between lawbreaker and law keeper, and based loosely on actual events, La Haine follows three young, bored lads on a what was suppose to be an average day, but turns into one they will always remember. Kassovitz directs the film with an incredible emphasis on realism (the whole crew moved into the Banlieue estate for months before shooting) and shows the world audience a completely different side to Paris - far from the rich vibrant colours and happy-go-lucky attitudes in films like Amelie (which Kassovitz also starred in).La Haine is a gritty ride, with no glamour, no colour, no over the top hyperbole - although the film was partially funded by US backers, and shows through the large amount of American influence throughout the film. But this was all part of the success of La Haine, which was able to play on already established French film making methods, deal with themes on a local, Parisian, level and also appeal to an international audience through use of the American influence - the boys discuss Disney cartoon characters and often wear American label clothes.From start to finish this is a truly captivating piece of cinema, with an ending that will leave you screaming for more, which deals with real issues such as the legitimacy of police work, racism and generally the amount of contempt we hold for each other. Kassovitz its truly in his element and i would struggle to think of a better film that deals with the realism of hatred between fellow men. A truly awesome film that should be seen by all film fans, and especially those who thinks that Paris is all about love stories, cobbled streets and cute little confectioners...",La Haine

Many people were scandalized by this film, stating it is too violent, too crude... neither is the case. It is one day in the lives of three teenagers in a dirty, dangerous suburb of Paris: Hubert (an African), Saïd (an Algerian), and Vincent (a Jew), and how they survive in a very hostile environment, where surviving for the next few minutes is the only thing you can look forward to. This is one of the greatest screenplays I have recently seen, and I think this film resembles many of the classics in many ways.

Then again, we humans are extremely imperfect, our every decision needs some form of prejudice or HIERARCHY-al-lise-ing meant. But this film should be, and is, put at NUMBER 1! At least for younger people. This is the simplest, jew boy, black boy, arab boy parable ON THE BEST DOPE EVER SMOKED. BEST SHOT EVER - look for Edith Piaf mixed with NWA (YES, f*#$ the police) FLYING OVER THE FRENCH GHETTO. Did I mention the BEST FILM SHOT EVER, (not counting the entire 'Russian Ark'). This film also takes the distinction of making Black and White film not only worthwhile, but the best choice. (Those that singularly prefer B&W are sentimental fools - ""when men were men, and film making was FAR MORE ELITIST than it is, even today"".) La Haine is the ONLY film to see before you die. Unless you are gay and then you'd better also see 'Brokeback Mountain' and if you are super gay, 'Prayers for Bobby'. No kidding, certainly no Homophobia, I loved those two films as well. But am I being far too influenced by 'Family Guy', persistent gay jokes? Probably not, Seth McFarlane DEFINITELY has something repressed there, and me, I was the classic, ""Gay guy with a straight guy hiding in the closet"", post modern freak show: 'Mum, I like Trannies.'

116,samsara761,Philosophy during the riots,8,16 July 2010,"French director Kassovitz was awarded the Palme D'or for Best Director at Cannes 1995, for this film. La Haine (released as Hate in the US) tells the story of a day in the lives of three youngsters, living in a council estate (banlieu) at the outskirts of Paris, in the aftermath of the beating of one of their friends by the police, which had lead to riots and confrontations with the armed forces. The film was shot in black and white, on a very low budget, using many non-professional actors. The scenes are mostly shot on location, in the Parisian suburb of Chanteloup-les-Vignes, with extended use of a hand-held camera, and plenty of stock footage of riots happened in the region in the 10 years preceding the film. The editing is adventurous and dramatic, and this provides a balanced and reliable point of view to the audience, even when the camera point of views are sometime incongruent.The setting of this film is a Parisian banlieu, a term loosely meaning suburb, but which in France assumes a different connotation, because the suburbs of Paris are normally inhabited by lower-income citizens,living in affordable blocks of flats and, in those areas, the social unrest is high, also because normally a high number of immigrants or naturalized citizens live there, almost in a ghetto situation. The movie rides the wave of the atmosphere of social unrest of the early 90's all over Europe, and especially France, Spain and Italy, and, undoubtedly, a lot of the its success arises from this situation. In those years, many so-called Social Centres appeared, and youngsters started to revolve around them, and be active in politics, especially of a left-wing orientation. And a certain type of socially-engaged art started to become stronger and more organized, and it gained consensus; however, the feature possesses high artistic merits, and its place amongst some of the greatest films is definitely deserved.",La Haine

However, it is an acting movie and quite an astounding one indeed. The one thing I noticed was that the actors used no character names but their own! An odd but very effective tool for making the intense and improvised dialogues more realistic. Furthermore the movie is entirely black & white erasing many of the emotion-enhancing colour effects and it takes place in the timespan of a single day. All of the above makes small but important add-ons to the overall impression and dark undertones throughout the picture.This movie is about hate. Its also about how kids of today act as individuals and in groups. Sometimes its all boredom but hey, that´s how it is. I guess the red line in this movie is about what hate does to us. The rookie policeman knows no hate. Watch him as he has to watch what he does not want to see. Try to pry into his mind. What will he become? What does the man in the public toilet really mean?See the movie through. See it one more time, then try to make up your mind about what you´ve seen. Do you feel sympathy or antipathy?

The film was supposed to be set in the aftermath of the Paris riots but for all the film portrayed it could have been after a bit of rain. There was no sense of anger, loss or hopelessness - just a bunch of young men moaning and brooding. These men were so unsympathetic I lost any kind of concern for them very early on. To me they just seemed a bunch of me, me,me victim-mentality that is all too common now. The dialogue was trying to be real and urban but it just came across as stilted. Anyway this film drones on and on without any plot twists, change of pace or building of tension. The obvious ""tragic"" ending couldn't have come soon enough for me.

Right on!The attitude of the outcasts may be correct and the film has great style but I always suspected this film was a liberal fantasy, it has taken ten years but recent history has shown it for what it is. The recent riots in France have shown that. Where were all the Jewish youths burning cars along with the Muslim youths? Nowhere it seems.I see since I first posted this 4 out of 5 people weren't happy about it. So what is the point of disagreement? Are Jewish youths in fact fighting the police in France and burning thousands of cars every year?

123,timothy_480,An original piece that pays tribute to its art form,8,2 November 2015,"The story of La Haine is not so clear from the outset. What is this film about, who are these people, what are the rules of their world and why? These are questions that I was asking myself for the first half hour of the film and then I realised that the film is not going to blatantly give me the answers as I'd expect. Instead it's going to slowly unravel them, intriguing me every so often and making me feel smart when I work something out. And that's exactly what happened. I found the story and plot to be fairly original in the sense that we haven't seen this type of story telling before this film. The shape of the dialogue could have been inspired by the likes of Tarantino but it stands on its own. Although the film can deal with brutal themes at times it is very comedic. There are little references to other films as well allowing the viewer to feel clever when they recognize them. The only issue with the story is that it is obviously a story for a specific audience. Not much context around the world of the characters is given making it difficult for westerners to feel sympathy for what the characters are going through because they simply don't understand the gravity of the situation.Technically, the film works okay. I understand the decision to make this film black and white but I don't think it needs it. It's not a subtle reference to the world of the film so it just feels like one of those wanky artistic decisions. Additionally, some of the shots could have been very beautiful but they simply weren't as they looked cheap. Perhaps the film makers were a little to ambitious and acting outside of what they could actually accomplish neatly. For the most part though the film looks and sounds like a documentary but this really works with the films gritty context.Acting: Exceptional.Overall, a nice independent film with an original concept of narrative structure and story telling techniques.",La Haine

126,cameronclan57,A film Scorcese would be proud of to make - Exceptional,10,20 July 2004,"La Haine for me was the pinnacle of how a film should be put over in it's true message of intent in a political sense. La Haine is a brutal, bold but simple film, which intelligently interweaves between three unique individuals.Highlighted throughout are the burdens and painful encounters with the much resented Police, but most of all themselves.The hatred that engulfs this film is found within one certain character 'Vinz' who breathes and speaks hatred everywhere he goes. The directors intention of this film was to give us the viewer a more prominent knowledge of the pain that many poor Parisians live in. Kassovitz does not want to confuse his viewer nor does he want to make us think simple thoughts of it. Instead he wants to make us think for ourself and let our imaginations see the anger and problems which face these people. In some peoples opinions La Haine is reminiscent to Spike Lee's 'Do the Right Thing', to me though La Haine is more. Lee's film is very one sided and although racial abuse comes from both sides the film does not give the viewer a concrete choice to follow. La Haine on the other hand shocks the audience into having no choice but to sympathize with Vinz and his peers. When you look around at their bleak and desolate existence you must think to yourself ""what would I do in their position?"". If you can see beyond the typical genre of mindless 'hood' films then you will come to realize that this film is a political statement that has the sole intention of changing this world. Once you have seen this film it is up to you to either carry on you're life not caring or actually feel some aspect of condolence for these people, if you do so then at least this film was not made in vain. While we interweave within each character we become manifested in the hatred and mental tiredness in which the films characters experience. La Haine gives a stark implication of how life really works for the less fortunate; Hubert had the chance to walk, Vinz was damn unlucky and Said was the helpless bystander. Vincent Cassel is vibrant and very believable as a man who is portrayed as a living time bomb. Hubert Kounde puts in an exceptional performance as a man intent on punching his way to freedom. Said Taghmaoui requires less ability in his role but he plays the character very well providing the balance between the other two characters. The finale to this film simply enhanced it's power over me as the viewer, intense and thought provoking it was. For this strong feeling I plead with you if La Haine has not yet been viewed by you make sure you watch it. It is brilliant masterpiece, which is amongst the most poignant films of it's nature to be brought to our screens. ""How you fall does not matter, it is how you land"" will always be something of a strong reminder that for some life is a never ending circle of pain and hate.",La Haine

French director Mathieu Kassovitz helped to escalate the growing problem of rioting through police brutality right up to the doorstep of leading men in the world of politics. The film has three main protagonist, all gelling their own unique personalities into the structure of the film to add a sense of diversity and interest. Following the routine lives of three disillusioned youths over the course of 24 hours, we are given a verite style insight into the social underclass of a Parisian housing estate or projects. This is a bold film that basically invites the viewer to watch just like Hubert describes as a ""drive by zoo"", and in return feel for the characters. The basic premise of this film is found within the tragedy a youth a few years before this film was made; a teenager who was beaten to his death in police custody helped to influence and propel this film's genesis. It is this event, which acts as the soul of the film, and is also the reason why it seems so real. Raging rap music by Cut Killer - Supreme NTM, allows us to see the inhabitants of the projects vent their anger at the loathed police, and the music also mirrors the personality of one particular individual; Vincent Cassel takes the role of Vinz, a French Jew who seems to be so exasperated all of the time we are simply waiting for him to explode. He is a vibrant character and practically epitomizes the term 'Hate'. When we see Vinz aim his Smith and Wesson in the face of a cop (simulating), he does it in such a cavalier fashion that we see just how screwed up his mind is by the social problems that suffocate him. His friend Said is quite the opposite of Vinz, while being quite a nonchalant character he does seem to accept his position in society with more composure and shrewdness - he doesn't go around flaunting a gun like his friend Vinz does. The final central character is Hubert, who is of African descent, and clearly being the wiser, more prudent of the three. Compared to Vinz and Said, Hubert's anger is inconspicuous, and he manages to channel his aggression. Vinz's hatred on the other hand is so perceptible that he usually brings trouble to his friends and Said never feels to intervene. The camera work of this film needs to be appreciated for it is quite stunning and every scene justifies its inclusion - to complement the hatred that is ever - present. The film culminates in the most provocative and powerful manner, where by the end of it you just know this film is on to something important. Kassovitz shows us that he is a rabid director and a dedicated man who simply wants to raise some serious questions. With it's Verlan dialect, daring, bold and imaginative cast and crew, this film delivers in the most fascinating depiction of police violence, ethnically diverse teenagers and social economic problems. I Strongly recommend this cinematic masterpiece of modern day film making.",La Haine

I have seen this movie over and over again, because it's just that good. the 3 characters (Vinz, Saïd and Hubert)act superb. even tough the movie is in black and white, it enhanced the movie. the main story of the film is just great, a real sub-urban style. furthermore it is a very powerful non-Hollywood film and that is an extra bonus. watch this movie and you'r hooked for life haha :).the ending is so powerful that you think: this movie is just to good to be true.i know my comment isn't very helpfull, but i wanted to give you all my opinion about the film.",La Haine
133,Mathias-4,"Stunning, visceral, seminal, brilliant.",10,22 November 1999,"This is a must-see film of the 90's. Although the themes of alienated youth, urban depression and violence have been tackled before, rarely has it been done with such style and assurance. As a directors first film it defies belief. From the opening, metaphysical parable, to the final, shocking gut-wrenching scene, this film oozes class. The performances are flawless, the sound-track superb and the set-piece scenes just blow you away (the fly-by shot though the estate with NWAs Fuck tha Police mixing with Je Ne Regrette Rien, or the break-dancers in the burnt-out warehouse). Funny, touching, and gripping by turns, the grainy black and white just adds to the mood. Films like this don't come around too often.",La Haine
134,hard2xplain,this concerns everyone,10,14 February 2002,"Moviemakers when filming French based films have traditionally tended to sentimentalise the people' through the celebration of les petits gens, the little people of Pagnol and Clair as well as more recently the fantastical Parisian wonderland environments of Amelie and Moulin Rouge. With La Haine, young director Mathieu Kassovitz took the flipside of this and gave an illustration of the awfulness of life in the depressed blue-collar areas of ParisLa Haine (Hate') begins after a night of rioting on a dismal housing estate on the northern outskirts of Paris and focuses on 24 hours in the lives of three close friends aged around 20. They are Vince (Vincent Cassel), an explosive working-class Jew, Hubert (Hubert Kounde), a handsome, soft-spoken black, and Said (Said Taghmaoui), a mercurial streetwise Arab. With little hopes or prospect of regular employment due to where they come from, the trio drift aimlessly, engaging in petty theft, and seething with aggressive resentment against an uncaring world. L'Avenir c'est nous (We Are the Future) is the ironic slogan on the estate's playground, but this is a film about people who believe they have no future.The quality of the performances from the 3 main actors, their conviction, the way they interact with one another and the vigour and fluency of Kassovitz's script and direction make this a very special movie indeed. Its full of action, detail, unexpected incidents and quirky humour. For instance, the boys have a bizarre encounter in a public lavatory in central Paris with a diminutive survivor of the Gulag that is as puzzling to them as it is to us.  Does the story the Gulag survivor tells them have a deeper meaning than on the surface? Of course it does, and importantly this film makes you think as to what the metaphor means. Throughout violence is always on the point of erupting. There are constant confrontations with a brutal, racist police force, and Vince has a 44 Magnum revolver that a plainclothes cop lost during the riots, which we know will eventually be used on someone. However none of this ever descends into mere gratuitous violence like so many Hollywood filmsLa Haine presents a state of affairs of the alienation faced by many young people in the projects' in France, and all over the world. It doesn't offer any solutions, though the point is forcibly made that in France, as elsewhere, parts of the police force are part of the problem rather than the solution. Of course, much of what we are shown is familiar to us from British and American films .The strength of the film is that it neither glamorises nor patronises its characters. They hate their life because it's boring, and they despise the society that's created it for them, together with parks, football fields and a few mod cons with which to comfort them. In particular, they hate the police, who hate them right back. The film's other major achievement is to show in a tangible and very expressive way how a cycle of distrust and anger is created on both sides of this awful divide, so that there is very little anyone can do about it. In other words violence and hate breeds more violence and hate.A criticism that could be levelled is that in the US / UK versions the sub-titles don't help, pushing what is very authentic dialogue into something more like cliché, as well as pointless miss-translations that occur. However this is just a minor thing, and does not and should not reflect at all on the film itself.This certainly is one of the greatest films of the 1990s. Its one of those rare films that you will think about for the days and weeks after  not solely about the film itself, but on wider issues such as society, poverty and racism.",La Haine

While 'Kids' focuses more on sexual irresponsibility and the AIDS crisis, 'La Haine' looks more at the class and race disparities, guns, and police violence.The acting of 'La Haine' is top notch. I don't speak French, so that's not a hard and fast judgement, but they were convincing, dynamic and fluid throughout. Then the minor characters, in contrast with the three main characters, were much more grounded and stable. That was an important piece to the puzzle. The three main men had to be fiery. The monologue of the old man was astounding.Then the ambiguous ending, absolutely killer, and Said's closed eyes say it all.Both 'Kids' and 'La Haine' are incredibly tragic time capsules.

140,jonathandavey101,about la Haine,9,19 June 2006,"Mateiu Cassovitz's Le Haine is shows the banleiue of France in an entirely new way, especially considering the recent trends in french cinema. Although influenced by Spike lees do the right thing the issue of racism isn't hugely elaborated on except by the nationalities of the three protagonists. The issue of police brutality is more important but shown in a less unbaised way than generally presumed as all three boys do do drugs and steal although this is presented as inconsequential. In my view the film largely focus's on the problems of kids from the banlieue being excluded from the rest of the country. This is shown by using wide angle and normal lenses in the banlieue and Paris, respectively. Several scenes hint that the boys themselves invite this treatment such as when they enter an art gallery and treated with respect until they begin shouting and smashing glasses. Another example would be there disastrous attempts to enter Astrix's house.I can't help but feel that the ending was almost too sudden and implausible as the particular cop (notre Darn) had so few interactions with vinz that it seems to demonize the police to a unrealistic degree.what makes this film is kassovitz seamless blending of realist(documentary) and anti realist techniques. The use of non actors, shooting on location and real footage give the film a sense of realism which is contrasted by using flashy kinetic camera movements, complicated tracks and focus pulls and stylish editing. This is very similar to city of god which uses all off these devices to show the criminal underworld of slums in Rio.Cassovitz also uses comedy to make serious points, my favourite example being the Grunwaski scene were an old man tells an amusing anecdote to demonstrate that the Paris ""Ghetto's"" were mearly estates compared to concentration camps or real guarded ghettos.All in all a great film but if you would like something with a little more plot watch ""Alice"" by Jan svankmeiyer.",La Haine

143,KaratCake,Best Foreign Film I've Ever Seen,10,28 November 2001,"I was recommended ""La Haine"" by a teenage rap producer in Montreal. Before this, I had never watched a black and white film before. The only black and white isht I've seen before that was ""the lil rascals"" back in the 80s. Anyhow, soon as the movie came on and I saw the black-n-white, I was halfway turned off and ready to turn off the vcr. The movie turned out to be my favorite reality film and in my top three ever list!The dialogue, the issues touched upon, the settings of the film, the camera work, the adventures.. just the whole setting, feel and story of the film made me kiss the TV. This was the exactly the type of film I was waiting for. I'm always a sucker for movies based on urban, smart/streetsmart youth.
1/4th of the way through the film, I forgot it was in black-n-white. Now I want to make movies in black and white! I love this film! I love this director! I love this writer. I'm going to watch this right now! If you love urban, gritty flicks (ala ""Kids"" or ""Gravesend"") with a little more of a mental aspect to it, then take it from Kae and get La Haine(Hate).

It's rare that a film like this is considered both genuine and a good example of it's art but La Haine is both.The plotline is compelling and realistic and neatly shows the way that inner city life has gone in the big cities in France as well as proving that despite the romance of Paris, it suffers from the same problems as any other major city.The characters are above all believable and the cast did a great job. The quality of acting is simply stunning from several actors and it would be a shame if it was simply dismissed as ""just another foreign art-house movie"" by audiences outside France.Above all the film whilst showing the influences of American films and society has a very clear sense of it's own identity and at no time does it feel like another US Ghetto film transposed to France. This is a major boon to the film and it stands out of the crowd for this, even though many people will dislike it because of this. It is, however, their loss.It's hard to recommend this film highly enough, but I should add that more than one viewing is required to get the best from La Haine.",La Haine

146,andyandyandypandy,a film that points out inner-city social fragmentation that can be appreciated worldwide,7,24 March 2007,"Mathieu Kassovitz's 'La Haine' is a film that deals with the major social concerns present in the French banlieues or suburbs, where social fragmentation in the society and hatred to a system that rejects the inhabitants have resulted in gangs of multi-ethnic youths. They fight each other for street cred or unite in their common hatred for the police system to take part in violent riots. The racist police are shown as a collective body representing the state, hating the youths right back in a vicious cycle of hate breeding hate.Kassovitz effectively captures the frustration of the youths and presents his own negative views of the police through his representation of them in the film. The film came out in 1995 at the same time as serious rioting in the banlieues in France. The film acts as a way of showing the serious issues in a way that prevents the government from just ignoring that they exist, which is what they had been doing, although Kassovitz said that he wasn't making a political movie.The film follows three youths, Vinz, an explosive Jew, Hubert, a thoughtful powerful black and Said, a streetwise Arab who represent the different cultures brought together by location and class. They reject French culture and look to America for their escapism through the film industry there and hip-hop/street culture. They even adapt their language to resemble black 'hood' language as they call each other 'homeys' and 'homeboys' regularly through the film. This is because they see themselves as being 'disowned' by France, their own country has pretended they don't exist and ignored the social problems present in the inner city areas. The result is environments that are like a separate country in the middle of big cities where the culture and motive of the inhabitants is very hostile to the outside. The proximity of this world to the financially successful, structured, policed areas breeds a hatred that may be subdued on the surface on both sides but inevitably overflows in outbursts of heavy violence, and the balance of peace is very fragile. At the beginning of the film we see the protesters being peaceable but making their points while the police are seen preparing for violence. Then we see a policeman throw a missile at the demonstrators kicking off the violent riot, so the police are shown by Kassovitz as being the perpetrators of the violence in the film.Mathieu uses the conflict between the police and the youths of the banlieues as a pointer to people in authority across the globe, as similar problems occur in most if not all major cities in one degree or another so the film is very relevant. A major reason for the films huge DVD sales in different countries was this relevance that people can associate and recognise with problems nearer to home.The film is cinema-verite as it aims to show a realistic portrayal of inner-city life, and it does this effectively. Kassovitz also uses some stylized touches in the film such as the Molotov cocktail hitting the world and blowing it up, which is imagery designed to symbolise the violence in the film, the image of the world means that this kind of violence and hate is a problem worldwide, a point I mentioned that this film is particularly relevant as a socio-political text throughout the globe.Kassovitz uses techniques used by Hitchcock in 'Vertigo' (the zoom in pull out shot) and Martin Scorsese with almost completely diegetic music reminiscent of 'Mean Streets', which is Kassovitz favourite film of all time. The film is filmed in black and white, which has been a feature of a few 90s French films. The effect of using black and white film stock is realism, but it also makes the film come across as 'arty'. I personally feel that the filming of this film in black and white was Kassovitz following a trend and seeing that people would view the film as being 'arty'. It is a little irritating and I much prefer colour film.All in all, this is a film from an era of French cinema that reflects the new freedom of directors to reject the previous romantic films that provided escapism for audiences and make films that highlight the darker, often shunned aside aspects of life. I feel that the film has some nice touches that reflect cultural interest across the world and that the actors really managed to immerse themselves into their roles in portraying believable frustrated youths. The film is a little tedious as not much happens, right up until the very end, but this reflects the lives of the youths, it is just time passing by doing nothing. If you're looking for a couple of hours of sheer escapism, don't choose this film, but if you are after some mental stimulation it's worth a look.",La Haine
147,ad_rock,The world is ours.,10,24 January 2002,"The film La Haine is considered to be one of the most controversial, powerful and innovative films of the 1990's. It won the Best Director award in the 1995 Cannes film festival and won film of the year (1996) at the Caesar awards. La Haine (which in French means 'hate') was considered innovative because it is part of a very underused style of French cinema called 'Un Cinema de Banlieue' or 'Cinema of the Suburbs' which depicts the grim reality of France's run-down suburbs. Other films from this genre include 'Etat des lieux' (1995), and 'Bye Bye' (1996).
It was considered different at the time because most French films from this period were either heritage films like 'Jean De Florette' (1985), 'Cyrano de Bergerac' (1990), and 'Manon des Sources' (1986). Or they were from the 'Cinema du Look' based on 'slick' visual style which includes such films as 'Diva' (1981), 'Nikita' (1990), and 'Subway' (1985).The cinematography in the film is very personal, and is shot almost in a documentary style, in that whenever a character or group of people moves the camera moves with them and when they stop the camera stops with them.There are also some outstanding shots in the film that continue the films theme of showing an horrific, real life situation but presenting it in an unreal way. The first of these shots is when a DJ opens his window turns his decks on and mixes Ice T's song 'Cop Killer' with old French records. As he is doing this, the camera goes over his shoulder and out of the window; it then flies over the entire estate as the music is playing in the background just to give the viewer a perspective of the dilapidated state of the estates. This is used to give the viewer a real understanding of why these people are constantly rioting against the police because they feel trapped in this urban jungle and that the police actually keep them down rather than help them.There is another shot where Vince and Hubert are standing on a raised level with the streets of Paris behind them. As they stand there the streets zoom in closer to the camera and they zoom out ever so slightly. This is a technique, which has been used many times in films, was pioneered by Steven Spielberg in the film 'Jaws'. Ever since that point it has been used by directors as a way of showing fear and tension in one shot. But typically Kassovitz inverts this theory and uses it as a way of showing how small and insignificant these characters become once they enter the big city. It is also another example of the film going against what Hollywood sets out as the norm.Another great example of the films theme of reality versus surrealism is in the way it is shot in black and white. If it were meant to have a documentary feel then it should surely be shot in color, but again Kassovitz goes against the rules of filming and shoots it in black and white to give it an unreal, dream like feel to the whole film. It also portrays the film as being straight and unrelenting, in his idea of the film as a metaphor for life, there is only black and white and no grey or colorful areas. It is also a wonderful way of making the projects in the Parisian suburbs seem even worse than they already are.The Mise-en-scene of the film plays an important part in reinforcing the traits and very individual characteristics of the main characters. The most important being Vince, the Paris native who believes himself to be from the streets and something of a rebel. His strange fixation with violence is only ever present when he is acting out violence; we see a great example of this when he is at home, in front of the mirror impersonating Robert De Niro's character from Taxi Driver. He acts out the scene in almost perfectly and at the end holds his hand up to the mirror and pulls the imaginary trigger, but we actually hear a gun shot go off. This is another hint towards Vince's delusion that his hand is a real gun and that he is some kind of thug. The same thing happens later on in the film when Vince points his hand at a cop and fires, in his mind he kills the cop but in reality nothing happens. Whenever Vince is confronted by real life opportunities to use the gun he backs out and realizes that he is nothing more than a normal man with a bad attitude.The editing in the film is kept quite simple, as to not detract from the documentary style of the camera work. However sometimes we see different speeds of fades and cuts and occasionally fades up from white instead of the usual black. This is to give a sense of surrealism and make the audience feel like this is a real life situation portrayed in an unreal 'Hollywood' way.The sound is also a very important part of the film as it gives more hints towards the influence of American Culture on the film and its inhabitants. During the scenes in Hubert's room we hear Barry White singing, which is a hint towards Hubert's wish for a calmer atmosphere, so he plays calmer music. The DJ mixes Ice T's Cop killer song with a lot of old French music which is another hint at the films apparent fusion between French and American culture. The scenes in the streets or in meeting places usually have hip-hop music playing, which is a sign of just how wide reaching American culture has become in its effect on French Popular culture.There are lots of hints towards American Culture and its influence on French Culture throughout the film. Indeed the way the film is shot is almost making fun of Hollywood's way of shooting real life situations in an 'entertaining' and 'easy to watch' way. In many ways it is Kassovitz's way of rebelling against Hollywood, by showing that he can do all the clever camera and editing techniques but accompany them with a strong script and identifiable characters.It clearly mocks Hollywood in a scene where Vince is constantly walking in and out of almost every film in the cinema complex because the films he watches are either riddled with clichés or just simply really bad. This is again Kassovitz trying to make the audience see just how unrealistic and bad some mainstream films can be. In doing so he has created a film that is everything some Hollywood films try to be, cutting edge, realistic yet surreal, humorous in a dark way and extremely powerful and poetic.",La Haine
148,oangeline,Impressioning movie,9,29 January 2003,"La Haine is a movie that is hard to forget.  I am not going to give you a whole summary, that is what the IMDB description above is for.  The last commentator who wrote about this movie called it superficial.  La Haine is an exact portrayal of some poor suburbs outside of Paris.  This movie speaks of real problems.  As a Franco-American who has spent a good chunk of my 18yr old life in Paris- I was very impressed how accurate the characters were. There are many cultural nuances, I think this is why I appreciate this film so much.  One of the characters is Jewish (Mathieu Kassovitz) and the other Arabic, whose family is from North Africa. My family is a Jewish Sephardic family from Algeria who moved to Paris after the war.  The expressions and stereotypes were right on target.  I loved how the director chose to mainly focus on the three peoples friendship, stressing each of their backgrounds.  It adds so much genuinity to the film.  TWhat striked me  was the joke's tagline ""Up till now, everythings fine"" -which is the characters' method and mentality to deal with poverty, and above all France's stinging racism, which is in a distinct league of its own.  Mathieu Kassovitz is brilliant.  This film is dolorously raw, real, yet hilarious.  Another excellent and very differnet movie with kassovitz is Amen.",La Haine

As if that wasn't bad enough, it's in black and white - despite what directors may tell you, this doesn't add poignancy or profundity, it is just lame. And more stupidly still, the (fixed) English subtitles are in white with no shaded background so you literally can't read them at all when the picture underneath is light.

I attempted to watch it without subtitles as my French is usually good enough to enjoy TV & film without, but I soon realised that I was missing too much due to the rapid fire slang and Parisian sub-cultural references. I would say that the English subtitles are a great help for following the story, but they do not really do an adequate job of conveying the linguistic style, grit and wit of the film. This is a shame because this film should be appreciated by as many people as possible! One thing I particularly liked is the use of the background as plot elements. The various tags and graffiti add to the pervasive aggression and irony for this apparently future-less group... look out for Vinz framed by a Perrier advert for example.I really do feel that this is a ""must see"" film and can't believe that there are people who reviewed it that couldn't see its merit.",La Haine

So prepare yourself to meet people with a different opinion on the problems portrayed in the movie. This is reality...",La Haine
155,Duncan Gunn,Beauty in Ugliness.,10,3 January 2000,"La Haine is a beautiful film. The acting is sublime and the setting poignant and real.

157,tesacque,So colorful,9,30 October 2006,"First thing, the sound and Photo quality is amazing ( the black and white give so much). The way of filming is also pretty interesting and sharp. The scenario is full of little stories who could also been seen as short movies in the movie. Of course some people would say that it's just another caricature of the french Banlieu, but I think that even if it's a little bit clichet, the atmosphere and the every hour reality is cleverly shown. The actors' play is lively and entertaining... The three different and complementary mentalities of the main characters gives a real balance all the way through. Just to say that I highly recommend that movie!1h30 well spent!",La Haine

159,MaximG,The best film I have ever seen,10,30 April 2002,"It's very easy to miss the point with a film such as ""La Haine"", as the comments on this page and the views of my friends clearly show.Vinz, Said, and Hubert all come off sympathetically; as wholly human, for all their flawsThe police do not come off sympathetically; aside from the cop who helps out Said.Whilst you may have anti-working class bias as a viewer, Mathieu Kassovitz as the FILM MAKER does not, and so implanting your own prejudices mars a beautiful film.The central strength of La Haine is that it is not purely polemical. It has polemic elements in its treatment of the police, but more it comes off as a fable for the new generation, a stark warning of ""a society in free-fall""; but ultimately only that, and not an overly moralising piece.
I love everything about this film, and if only more people had seen it",La Haine
160,RichGordonUK,Wonderful,10,9 July 2002,"This is a very powerful film enhanced by being filmed in black and white, telling a story which could be set in any 'housing project' across the world be it London, Liverpool, LA, Berlin.

161,tadziokoelb,An amazing psychosocial study,10,2 November 2002,"Easily one of the best films I have ever seen, La Haine is a revision of Do the Right Thing with the stakes raised to encompass far more than just the pressing issue of race: it is a hair-raising portrait of poverty, urbanism, and contemporary culture. The joke that opens the film, about a man falling from a tall building but hoping for the best, becomes a powerful metaphore for the future that awaits a society unable to face its problems. Brilliantly shot, brilliantly acted.",La Haine
162,alicattness,Simply phenomenal,10,2 June 2003,"Really truly full of both profundity and beauty while dealing with completely senseless violence of the paris ghetto.we watched the film for my french literature class and i simply fell in love with it from the opening credits with bob marley's song, Burnin' and Lootin' Tonight.every scene is completely significant. Kassovits ties every element together to produce an entirely significant film.To be honest, i dont live in the ghetto, i dont worry about my friends being shot and harassed by police; yet, the message in the movie is totally applicable to anyone's life.I am totally inspired by this movie to finally get started on making my own.  I really cannot understand how people didnt enjoy this movie on some level.after seeing it only once, it has offically become my favourite movie of all time!i am so glad that there are so many other people who have seen and appreciated at least one thing about it!",La Haine

164,broutcha,"So simple and so true.. Excellent movie, a must-watch.",9,12 February 2007,"This movie is definitely a must-see, at least for people fluent in french. M. Kassovitz pictures the everyday life of 3 average young guys living in the suburbs of Paris, at a time where the fights between the police and the youth are at their paroxysm. What's really good about this movie is how close to reality it takes you. The characters are simple, they could definitely be your average neighbor, i.e. not especially good-looking or smart or with any kind of hidden gift. The storyline itself honors that: sometimes we see nothing happening around the characters, nothing at all, for minutes. That's enough to make you feel how empty their day can be, but not too long to make you feel bored. The music is minimalist (when there is any music at all) and this fits perfectly.Altought it could seem difficult to get us interested with such realistic, everyday stuff, the plot actually holds us until the end. It's a journey, and we always want to see what's next, and we do get something new every minute. It's totally unpredictable, yet logical and realistic... The character development is excellent, we really get to know the main characters and discover their personality, dreams and fate.Go watch it!Sidenote : I'd mitigate my judgment if you don't speak french, though. The french spoken here not very academic :-) and the translations face the risk to lack some of the 'authenticity' that blesses this movie.",La Haine

166,pgryan,Incendiary... even more relevant since 2005 French riots...,10,16 February 2006,"Someone once said: If divinity can exist on the writtten page, Nabokov proves the existence of god. It's not hard to draw a similar conclusion about Matthieu Kassovitz's searing La Haine. Sublime, impassioned, magnificent; no list of adjectives can truly sum up the impact this film has on the viewer. Breathtaking from start to finish, every little detail makes your jaw drop. Of particular note is the turntable scene with the bird's eye view of the flats, an encounter with a diminutive storytelling gent in a restroom, and one gruesome scene which shows the Parisian police at their vicious worst.The film contains a strong moral message, but is in no way didactic. It's about a society in freefall; ""It's not the fall that kills you, it's the landing"". I felt one way of dissecting La Haine is to view the whole thing as a prelude to what comes after the final scene... i.e. the landing. Poverty, an alienated and disaffected youth. Ghettoisation, a subclass penned into ""les banlieus""; outbursts of nihilistic violence the only logical result. This film is like an eerie premonition of the riots that happened in the urban centres of France last year. Gangs of Moroccan, Algerian, wherever, youths wreak havoc on Western Europe; the question is what else can you expect from a caged and brutalised animal? La Haine raises unpleasant questions for the policymakers of the Western world. Over ten years after its release, those questions are no nearer to being answered.",La Haine
167,ctodd183,The best movie I have ever seen.,10,16 January 2009,"Ladies and gentlemen, this movie is a masterpiece.I first saw it in my High School French class, and even with kids passing notes and whispering in class, I was still moved. The acting is flawless. Not every line is completely verbatim, but that's what makes it so good. Each piece of dialect is real and passionate. What I found even more breathtaking was the shots. Each scene is artfully filmed, with certain characters placed on certain sides for a specific reason. Not to mention the ending, which is incredibly shocking and heart retching. I was left with my jaw on the floor.I urge everyone to see this movie. If you don't speak French, watch it with English subtitles. It's truly incredible.",La Haine
168,farzadb,One of the best (most important?) movies of the 90's,10,9 September 1999,"La Haine is a realistic and gut-wrenching look at life in a Paris suburb/ghetto. I have never been so bummed out at the end of a movie as I have at the end of this one. Every scene is tense and built up beautifully. I couldn't get myself to take a breath during the last sequence of the film.
Another brilliant touch is the use of French slang which adds another layer of realism to the story. The metaphors, the imagery, the use of language and music is all handled in an effective way to tell the very sad story of 3 friends as they try to survive another day in an unforgiving environment full of racism and violence.This is definitely one of the best films ever made to address  police brutality and racism to say nothing about life in a ghetto or trying to live outside of it where you're not accepted.

That is exactly the point, French youth (I mean the one that lives in such buildings) has nothing to do, and this reality, that is quite sad, is frightening to.Photography is great, story is really cool, music is good, and it could be a teenage movie like there are plenty in the USA, but it is more intelligent and sadder than that.A master piece from one of the greatest French director of the 90's.",La Haine

The film was such a fantastic portrayal of the projects in France. La Haine has the all the ingredients for a classic, it is funny, tragic and extremely hard hitting. It combines police brutally with every day life, and highlights the hopelessness that young people in the ""banlieus"" feel. Talking about this film, I have heard mixed reactions, but if you can relate to what is going on then it is, to coin a well used phrase, ""a must see movie"". 10/10 in my books!",La Haine
173,ral61,"A tough, honest and human film thankfully not drenched in sentimentality.",9,11 March 2000,"At first sight, La Haine seems a film very much of its time. But it manages to break out of this accusation by focusing on the emotions of its characters. Set the day AFTER a Parisian riot (unlike most other films, which lead up to a riot as a kinetic, cinematic climax), the three main characters deal with the hospitalization of a friend by the police in startlingly different ways, despite their common background of prejudice and disillusion. It's the play between the three that makes the film, as over the space of 24 hours the viewer comes to understand their frustration - almost siding with them in the battle - before the denouement brings home the reality of the actions of both sides - the authorities and the protagonists. Filled with too many 'Oh no' moments for comfort, it's not a film that will make you feel warm and happy, but it still evokes a sense of hope that tough, honest and above all human films can be made these days without being drenched in sentimentality.",La Haine
174,Cryptoprocta,This film has something that every film should have.,10,24 May 2000,"This film makes you sit down and watch. It grabs you and makes you feel you are there inside the characters minds. It describes ""ghetto life"" perfectly in the way that many films can't.

176,tom-robertson,"A truly great, contemporary French film, and still so relevant today",10,4 May 2006,"I was amazed when I saw La Haine: a brilliant film and possibly one of the best of the 90s. With its superb, pounding soundtrack, harsh, grainy, monochrome film, and terrific employment of verlan, it's a great representation of, and comment on, life in the banlieue. This film simply blew me away, documenting 24 shattering hours in the lives of three close friends; Said, Hubert and Vinz, each of different ethnic backgrounds, but each united in their resentment towards and dissatisfaction with the authorities. What amazed me even more was that now, it's over 10 years old, and even now is as timeless and relevant as ever: it really helped me to understand the relatively recent rioting in Paris, which began in suburbs much like this one. Overall this film is relevant, poignant, funny, real and quite possibly one of the best films ever made about the plight of urban youth, not just in France but in the rest of the world too.",La Haine
177,thecinephile1,nothing short of a masterpiece! No other film explores the depths of hatred and its concomitant inexorable descent to destruction in such a gripping and engaging,9,30 October 2019,"The film is set in a French project during the 1990s. The conflict of the story centers on an episode of Local police brutality against a young teenager named Abdel. After being viciously beaten and hospitalized while in police custody, Abdel languishes in a hospital, and his plight stirs the passions of his friends. The plot focuses particularly on Vinz, who vows to kill a police officer if his friend dies. So what makes this film so incredible? First off, the principal actors, Vincent Cassel, Saïd Taghmaoui, and Hubert Koundé, impeccably inhabit their roles and perfectly complement one another's performances. Beyond this, the filmmaking is superb with some of the best modern black-and-white cinematography I've ever seen. The editing is brilliantly stylistic and rhythmic. The film also contains fantastic writing and directing by Mathieu Kassovitz who ablely creates unexpected sympathy for the characters in their world as they repeatedly try to overcome the system. But in the end, there is only one place they can land. Overall I don't have any real criticisms that aren't just nitpicking, and I can't think of very many people to whom I wouldn't recommend this movie, so because of that and much more, I'm giving this film 10 out of 10 stars.",La Haine

Once they understood the project, they accepted the idea of the making of the movie. The movie has been made in color then post producted in Black & White, the deal was the movie in theater in Black & White, and if the movie wouldn't work in Theather, it would get released in color in home support.Hopefully it worked in theaters.I like this movie for many reasons, one of the few is the way Paris is in this movie, i'm always glad in the movie when they go to Paris and go away from where they leave.City Of God (La Cite De Dieu, Cidade de Deus) is a movie in the same kind of way in the sense as it shows you a side of Brazil (Rio) not very known.The credits at the end are short because the director wanted a quick lights on in the theater, for those who wonder.I recommend it to everyone.",La Haine

Not only does it bring the harsh reality about life in the french suburbs (les bonlieus)into light, it also contains a plot in which many of us younger and troubled youths can relate to.It is a film which depicts trouble, hatred (hence the title)and the struggles in life for the social under classes in society. Freedom is also represented with a certain brutality, which the film, through being shot in black and white, represents brilliantly (somewhat reminiscent of Schindler's List.)This also aids the film by using black and white as a metaphor for the situation of racism in France, which the film (I think) is intended to portray.I can not comment further on this other than to say it is A MUST SEE film,a beautiful film and one that has deserved all the critical acclaim and success it has received.",La Haine
184,Mat the masta,how can you sum up a film this beautiful & slick,10,10 April 2002,"I first saw this film in 1997, after seeing and reading reviews about it on tv and the net for a couple of years. I never thought a film could actually make you truly think about things around our world, not just how bad it can be in places like the projects set in the film. I could truly see this happening where I am from(Rochdale,Manchester,UK).The situation set in the film is a dark and nasty one. you watch 3 friends fall apart from the aftermath of a riot in a parisian project.a friend is near-fatally injured in police custody, which sparks a chain of events, part forced onto the 3 friends, part of self-inflicted.the acting is amazing. Vincent Cassel's performance is electrifying. his mentality is distorted with hate(hence the film name), but you truly feel he is not a bad seed. His problem is he can't see the wood for the trees, which Hubert tries to point out to him.Hubert is a character who has the potential to better his life, but he is trapped in his parisian project cell. he tries to guide vinz to a healthier and more productive way of thinking about life.said seems to be the one who doesn't want trouble, but it is thrust upon him. he sees the relationship between hubert and vinz, his 2 best friend, deteriorate, but doesn't know who to side with, or what to do about it.Mathieu Kassovitz made this film in a way that you feel for both the police and the the 3 friends. It is amazing to watch, as mathieu takes the simplest things, and makes them look classy(check out the DJ scene for a true example of what I mean). he uses black and white as to colour, and it doesn't look fake, or cheesy. in fact it enhances the film more than you could imagine. you won't sit there and wish he filmed it in colour by the end. the action, although relatively mild compared to todays film, is believable.speaking about the end, it is one of the most simplest and powerful endings I have seen in a film yet. the soundtrack is awesome too. who would have thought french hip-hop would sound so sweet.",La Haine

Black and white, one great freaking soundtrack, amazing amateur acting, a very real script, and just a blazing atmosphere set this movie apart from almost every indie film in the last 20 years. a mixture of race had to be done to achieve the mentality of youth in a ""ghetto"" culture like this. I grew up in Echo Park, Compton, and in a sprawling, nasty, dirty, section of Indianapolis when I was much younger. I know how these kids felt. I was a white boy screwing around with a couple of black kids smoking jays, causing a little bit of havoc, and just seeing what our city had to offer. Cops were rarely a problem, but I do know that race profiling is real. Even if you are white. Screw racist cops.The ending is one of the most abrupt and BEST endings I have ever seen.

190,sokak06,A masterpiece about class discrimination,8,22 March 2012,"I have always wanted to see this movie for so long. It was very successful on representing the modern resistance spirit which is shaped generally by the fear of being in isolation. This isolation isn't just the problem of our era but its consequents can never be seen so explicitly. The camera, colour and the character choices are very well chosen. The attitude of the director about the movie isn't precluding the enjoyment of watching a movie. This can be seen in the scenario which is realistic, humorous and unpredictable.The acting of all three actors is superb and very suitable for the ideas, conflicts and feelings of real mankind.The story isn't just containing a day and a night of a three friends but it certainly uncovers the nature of violence by a cop rifle which determines the criminal and guilt.At the end I must admit that the music was very beautiful and astonishing.The beginning with Bob Marley and the scene of Cut Killer in the neighborhood is unforgettable.

192,captaingrilli,Magical realism poetic movie,10,9 July 2013,"La haine is an excellent movie a great proof that the old poetic oneiric movie-making is still alive. all the scenes in the movie are pure poetry transmitting this mysteriousness behind their symbols. Mathieu Kassovitz faces deep themes concerning human identity in contrast with a degrading society fuelled by hate. the title haine actually means hate, throughout the movie we witness hateful actions, hate against the different, hate that flows like blood in our streets and our souls. The movie means to show that our society is auto destructive, in fact it starts with a spoken quote ""as a man is falling from a building he says to himself .so far so good, so far so good. the problem is not the fall, it's the impact to the ground:"". The director uses this idea and puts it in a metaphors which is the story . The story takes place in Paris's projects during an ordinary day in the life of three friends Vinz, Hubert and Said each with a different personalty that react in their own way facing Society. the plot's growth represents a time bomb, time after time events worsten till we arrive to the end when the bomb explodes...BOOOM!! Another theme in the movie is the contrast between dream and reality. the main characters face events out of the ordinary (cow sighting) that are opposed by reality surrounding them, reality brings them back to earth and their illusory beliefs such as the vengeance of Vinz and Hubert's desire to escape. the events that follow each other contain a great unofficial magical realism influence, After a whole day and a night pass away composed by a dreamy and mysterious atmosphere; the morning comes and the harsh reality hits back making the bomb explode with the sure death of Vinz and the presumable of Hubert that it is obscured by the ending. Behind Grumwalski's story another theme is hidden which is relativism; every belief and faith an individual has is completely useless cause this life does not believe in you, and it is a complete absurdity without sense.

193,marko-milojevic-kg,"""So far, so good""",10,9 June 2013,"I usually don't write reviews, but for this one I'll make exception because it caught my eye.Great film, as for the french cinema, so for the world. I guess I won't be able to say everything that's great about this film, but surely I will try.Mathieu Kassovitz is showing us one day in the life of three violent young men. One of them is Jewish (Vinz), one of them Arab (Saïd), and the third one is black (Hubert). They live in a very violent hood full of riots. They're strongly involved in the conflict with the police. They don't have any other interests, except to become a wannabe street heroes, although Hubert does some boxing at the gym that has been burnt somewhere in the beginning of the movie. La haine starts with the scene of riots on the streets of France. I'm not informed when and why these things were happening, but it doesn't matter, cause they can happen every moment, in every corner of the world. In fact, these things are happening at this exact moment in which I'm writing. Opening scene is perfectly followed by Bob Marley's ""Burnin' and Lootin"", a sweet reggae melody. You can see some irony here. Then, we learn, from the TV news, that some Arabian guy has been wounded by the hand of the police. We meet the characters and then the story flows like a water. Story itself contains several events happening in a chronological order at different times of day. It is very well composed so we can understand the characters and the problems they're dealing with. They are chasing their identities and personalities. They are trying to be something what they consider to be right. But they are slaves of the modern society, and the slaves of the occasions in which they are. They are immature, they don't think before they do, and worst of all, they are hiding the truth from themselves. This is a story about the hunt for identity, about youth that is lost in the chaos of modern society, so when they try to find themselves, they actually become part of that chaos. ""Heard about the guy who fell off a skyscraper? On his way down past each floor, he kept saying to reassure himself: So far so good... so far so good... so far so good. How you fall doesn't matter. It's how you land!"" They are falling, but they are lying to themselves on the way down, and when they touch the ground, it won't end happily.La haine (Hate) is simple, yet powerful name for movie. It fits perfectly with its main theme. Hate. Unreasonable hate. People who hate something or someone because their friends and idols do that, because it's popular, because they want to feel accepted by the group. It's not a problem in violence, it's a problem in its cause.Whole film is filled with the symbols. I noticed some of them, I read some of the messages, but I'm sure that there are many more that I will catch on the second watching.Episode with the old man in the toilet? Brilliant. Whole symbolic Grunwalski story about the pride and death and the way it was told. Tadek Lokcinski like a prophet here, totally steals the scene in a few minutes of his appearance. A strong moral behind the story, but the boys can't understand it yet. It will cost them, so they will learn it on the hard way.Paroles on the walls that we can see everywhere around the city. One of them ""The World is yours"" (Said corrected it to ""The World is ours"") is the main motto of these young men. They want to try everything, and they want it now, but they don't see the hole on the end of the road they went. This also may indicate Scarface, which contains similar messages.One more thing that I found interesting was the picture of the poet, Charles Baudelaire on the building at the end of the movie, and I am sure that this isn't randomly put there. Baudelaire wrote the poem called ""Le Tonneau de la Haine"" (The Cask of Hate) so there's an obvious connection.I like the fact that the characters have the same names as the actors that play them. Crime isn't glorified in this movie, neither is the law. Violence is strongly criticized, modern society isn't spared either. Nothing is exaggerated, this is pretty realistic picture of what's happening around and inside us. We can get to like the characters, but it would be wrong if we agreed with most of their deeds.Did we learn something from this movie? Well, we learned plenty of things. Paris, so as the world, isn't just a city of love, there are ""black and gray"" sides of it. It may be easy to tell, but not to do. Especially to pull the trigger and kill the face in front of you. Neither side of the conflict is absolutely right or absolutely wrong. Sometimes is better to swallow the pride. Batman is not so strong. Directing and camera work are great, acting too, dialogs are smooth and interesting even with the English subtitles, so I can only dream how much this is enjoyable for the French speaker. Soundtrack is one more great part of the film. I didn't write the flaws of the movie because when I watch some gem of the cinema like this one, I try to concentrate on the good parts of it, and as I said, La haine is full of them. And still, there are many things that I forgot to write, or missed while I was watching.10/10 I suggest it to everyone, don't be repelled by the bunch of kids who try to identify with the characters in this movie.",La Haine

195,oscarpye_jeary,Get this film Kidz,10,26 July 2004,"This is an excellent film and i would (and constantly do) recommend that everyone see this film. I saw this film 2 days after i'd seen Larry Clarks Kidz and the two are often compared since they came out at the same time and are both tragic tales about poor disillusioned youth. However i thought Kidz was utter cak compared to La Haine. La Haine had a better story, better characters and vitally a better director. La Haine, like all great films should be, is a work of art, written and directed by a man who'd decided that he wants to make every shot as good as it can be. I'm not one for gritty realism. The sort of dodgy hand held camera/ documentary look because i've seen it a thousand times an i can do it myself. Some claim that it gives the film more gravitas or that it makes the statement bolder but i can see no film that makes its statement bolder through great cinematography than La Haine. Its a nightmare shot like a dream. In Kidz i didn't care about the characters, was bored by the dialogue and wasn't particularly shocked or moved by the ending (and i thought it lingered for too long on many scenes) La Haine in contrast never lingered for too long on anything (apart from maybe the s**t man in the toilet), it was sharp, too the point and then onto the next scene. Similarly the characters where engrossing, each one already described to us before they'd uttered a word or left they're bed. The actors themselves where terrific, Said in particular who brought most of the needed comic relief and a perfect portrayal of the sort of cockly little street kid you encounter every day. The subtitles on the DVD and VHS versions are bad and although it's hardly something to tarnish the quality of the film it does frustrate at times especially the candid camera story and vince cutting said's hair. It would have been sensible to outline them or put them below the screen itself. despite risking sounding like a 12 year old, all i can say is that its a very cool film. The sound track is great, especially cut killer Djing out his window, and the sly little messages on posters and graffiti are poignant rather then preachy. A scene where Hubert is standing in front of a advertising board at a bus stop beneath the words 'potrait of a killer' only to reveal he's covering the words ' of thirst' on a badoit ad struck me particularly ...unfortunately the subtitlers on my DVD copy missed that altogether but they showed it on filmfour...However the film on the whole is fantastic cinema with every scene relevant and shot beautifully from the molotov cocktail at the start to said's distraught face at the end....kids....go see this film",La Haine

197,garyw2w,excellent in many ways,10,3 August 2005,"the movie digs out the basic human emotion--anger.the movie introduces a Jewish; an Arab and a black to us. it shows us only twenty hours of their lives in Paris. and that is enough to reveal all the racial and violent problems existing and all the potential dangers ridden in the society.Vinz is a sample of a kind of people who are sick of the system, have got passion and desires to change the situation, but lack of thinking and planning sometimes. Hupert thinks much more than Vinz, he is sick of the situation too, but he realizes that individuals are loose and it is not possible to change the reality with minor power, he'd rather choose to leave Paris to solve the situation for him. Said the Arab guy is a trouble maker, he doesn't think much about what is happening around him, he just lives the days.three guys are from different minority groups, having different personalities, all living in the bottom of the economic ladder.I like the music and dancing pieces in the movie too. and the style fits the beats of the movie.Hupert was mocking Vinz about not shooting any cops holding a gun in his hand, however, when he was given the gun and saw Vinz was shot by the cop, although was by accident, Hupert in the end, finally felt what Vinz felt about his friend's death. and felt the same rage from Vinz's within.",La Haine
198,mikael-ostberg,Intense and so very real! A Masterpiece!,10,14 June 2013,"""Reality"", would be the simplest word for me to describe the main theme of this movie. Surely it depicts social, economical and racial factors but furthermore this is an analysis of human behaviour in its rawest form. Hate, anguish and sadness all correlate and it is my belief that these emotions have never been so clearly shown in a picture. I believe that any respectable, may it be American or European politician has to have seen this movie. It is filled with truths that are nothing but extremely valuable. It is relatable in so many ways; may it be because of the acting or simply because of the ""heart aching"" storyline. Contrary to preceding reviews I feel it is important to emphasize the way this film focuses on feelings of injustice, ""HATE"", and the power embedded in them. It is my belief that this movie is the most relevant of them all when it comes to portraying present realities and I challenge anyone to state the contrary. It is not only agonizing but revolting. I am myself of french, Swedish and algerian origins. Watch this movie and learn.",La Haine

200,chrisdenial,Rude Awakening,10,9 April 2009,"What does one need to put a magnificent story into real act, to release a set of encrusted emotions and channel it to a vivacious flow? Passion? Love? A strong need to convey a message? Mattieu Kassovitz combined all those three plus a myriad of other motivation-driven tricks to embody the ambiance of a society torn by inner insecurity, grudge and hardly suppressed hatred. ""La Haine"" represents a 24 hours trip in the bowels of a modern decline fortified by volatile urge to express oneself, smothered in its formative stages by the uncompromising fist of a racist slogan: ""We don't need you, because you don't belong here..."" A truly heart-shattering, compelling and vivid effort, ""La Haine"" is a veritable apotheosis of suffering. Suffering inbred as a mental handicap of those of the 'cite', suffering as a result of deprivation, suffering in the midst of an isolated cesspit - a rake well of obtuse silence, suffering for the sake of suffering. For the will to refuse changing yourself, the brave stance in battling conformism results in tragedy. A tragedy expected that is. A tragedy as the only way to salvage what ""they"" have been stealing from you - the belief in the right to live and exist as a free person. Because in modern France slavery may be a term out-of-hand yet it has mutated rabidly into forms not less hideous and cruel as the affirmative alienation and deep resent that is aimed towards the immigrants and their spawn. Those who had a major role in building modern France of le tour d'Eiffel, the speed arrow train facilities, the outstanding port 'd'Marseille' has been treated as a subhuman breed for years. Kassovitz is extremely socially conscious and in the same time purely conscientious in his effort to picture the inevitable collision of the disaffected Arab, African, etc. youth born in France yet devoid of the right (and rather unwilling) to be accepted as a part of an arrogant, narcissistic and self-sufficient ""white pride"" society. Through their friendship and attitude towards the surrounding air of neglect and complacency Vinz, Hubert and Sayid evolve as a separate entity - a true embodiment of the stark denial, perennial mistrust and exasperation which are sifting through the ghetto concrete around the French ""problematic"" blocks. A spontaneous urge to draw the line between the French communes and American hoods which has always indulged vast media coverage thus turning to a sort of a dream vision medium where bling bling and crack cocaine co-exist and complement each other as if one could benefit and make a glorious living of dealing drugs while sporting all the landmarks of a true ""ghetto-blaster"" - fast cars, fast women, jewelry, a never-ending party time rises. The French 'banlieue' presents us with a whole lot of dramatically sobering reality - the ugly blocks of flats soaring high in the sky, crumbling and grey, stone-cold in their dumb silence - fearsome cages of a humbled spiritual leap into nothingness, the mosques - a place to reunite and seek God's advice on how to escape from the uncompromising void outside, the dim streets - veritable lairs of violence, petty crime and corruption and of course swarming around those prerequisites of a modern French suburb there is a motley crowd. One can sense its energy, a picture throbbing with vitality and pristine emotions. As if we stare at a wild animal caged in captivity by its civil-spoken master. The American ghetto image has been used for ages to cash in and idolize a vast array of show business entertainers while the French 'cite' with its ingenious combative spirit, reluctance to reform and profound resentment for the authorities has always stood as a thorn in the regime of power's flesh. Mattieu Kassovitz managed to capture the vibe of a modern French suburb and its mess of low-income housing and low self-esteemed tenants. I have watched ""La Haine"" probably on six or seven occasions and I am still able to perceive new striking details with each spin of the wheel. I strongly suggest that you read what others think of the movie in IMDb.com reviews repository. Many stressed exactly on the fact that watching ""La Haine"" again and again proves to be a reward experience. For beneath the surface of a simple yet tragic story one is about to discover easily a fathomless abyss of tragically enormous question marks and yet in the same time figure out a short set of simple answers.",La Haine
201,lutetia-1,Very actual,9,8 November 2005,"Given the time of shooting (1995), the movie shows a remarkable foreseeing given the actual situation in the major french suburban's. It is as if this movie is used as a guideline for the aggressiveness of the last week.If a 10 year old movie is so realistic for today's situation, it can only be a very good movie. And it is a very good movie. The acting is very realistic, the story is very realistic and the shootings in BW gives the movie something extra.I rate it a 9. The movie would have been a 10 if the artistic side of the movie had something in there that made it really special, i.e. some coloured effects to strenghten some scenes (like Sin City has). Worth watching especially at this time if only for trying to understand what's going on in the suburb's of the major European cities.",La Haine

La haine is a modern classic which i thought should have gotten the best foreign language film award at the Oscars and a best actor nod for Vincent cassel as vinz. It is tense, suspenseful, funny, emotional, vivid and real. It is a film with soul, dark and brutal but shines a light on socio-economic and racial issues in France.

I was watching it in media and i nearly fell asleep! Over all though the message it puts across is rather random, it doesn't set a good example of how you should act towards the police, and what you should do in a similar situation.

I just finished viewing it in an African Studies Meeting and I simply adored the acting and film style. I can relate to the characters because I was ONCE a bit of each of them. I can also very much relate to Hubert and his struggles. Growing up, I have gone from the horrid conditions of Africa, to the ghettos of Arkansas,USA and New Orleans, USA to the horrid slums of Haiti, Republica Dominica and Burkina Faso. I found myself in numerous criminal enterprises because the so called ""good"" people were too busy to aid us poor, starving, low class ghetto youth. I have since cleaned my act up and thankfully never been caught and imprisoned. I have experienced many sides of the French and American colonial aftermaths and I know it is a sad place to find oneself in.

208,mariahgreenarts,Personal analysis,9,28 September 2017,"La Haine1995's La Haine was all too familiar to the condition of today's society. Directed and written by Mathieu Kassovitz, taking personal pieces of past to the screen. The story based around three young men living in France struggling to find meaning in life and a way out of the issues they created still digging themselves deeper in unpleasant events. Identical to the youth in the U.S, we often find ourselves seeking fillers to fill voids. Not every decision made is in prime, but rather how we reciprocate to the issue is valuable. As the main characters, Vinz, Hubert, and Benoit advance through the story, dodging police and local gangs, the three press on through the cities of France, you discern the imbalance in personalities the characters put on. This imbalance is naturally what advanced the story forward, placing the young men in individual states of unease, making an urgency to resolve the issues placed in their course. Looking at Mathieu Kassovitz's film that has communicated on first hand relatable occurrences that effortlessly touch views minds. Being a millennial of current times, personally knowing how persuaded myself, as well as other youth can get when the pressure is up. La Haine's ending was a shake of disastrous, almost a warning, futurous look on the world if the youth do not revise their actions and think of the long term effects. Hubert: ""... How you fall doesn't matter. Its how you land!""",La Haine
209,edward-jost,Greatest film ever!,10,29 November 2008,"Really good film that I caught on accident after getting home from the pub. Vincent Caselle is great and the rest of the cast are superbly chosen. All in black and white plus subtitles but don't let this put you off (if this is the kind of thing that might put you off a film). Sound track is also grand.Very atmospheric of Paris during the riots. Bit of action, bit of comedy, plenty of drama. Bunch of lads on a skummy housing estate in Paris and a mate of theirs is duffed up by plod and then dies. This gets all the miss fits on the estate looking for a tear up with old bill. A boxing gym gets burnt down and these three lads end up in Paris and get in to a fight with some skinheads.Clearly their is more to the film than this but I needed to put 10 lines in to get my comment on the site and the main aim of this was to tell people they have to watch the film.If you like Vincent in this then you must watch Doberman.",La Haine
210,jukka-salmi,Viha- La Haine,10,3 February 2006,"This movie blow my mind. I first saw it when i was going to see anther movie but it was sold out. Already set my mind to go a movie, i purchased ticket to this La Haine -viha in finnish, without knowing anything about it than what the movie poster showed in the lobby of the movie theater.Powerful beginning with the riots in the streets, together with Bob Marleys song was very promising. Soon after the scene where Said opened his eyes and in a way wrapped us, the movie audience into to his world, in the suburbs of Paris. Just like that, simple effect and together with sound and puf, you're in the never neverland and the journey can begin.Throughout the movie, every single detail (yes, even the colorful cow in a movie otherwise black and white) seemed the get their place in this movie. Flawless storytelling, intense acting and mastery in directing this film by Mathieu Kassovitz is truly a modern masterpiece which value, i am sure, will grow as the years go by like a vintage wine.Unique storytelling also remembers to end the story well, this is often neglected in modern movies. You may have seen movies which are great but the ending spoils everything, but in La Haine this is also in good hands and when the subtitles goes by after the movie has ended, you literally still remain seated because it takes a while before you understand that you are not in the world of this movie, but your own.La Haine: my top 5 movies number 1.PS. the others are: Apocalypse now, Sideways, Lost In translation and American Beauty - i recommend warmly to see these movies!",La Haine
211,Christov013,great movie about social problems and how they're being dealt with,10,16 February 2006,"When the riots broke out last autumn in Paris..the first thing I thought about was this movie. I put on the TV and all the scenes reminded me off the best movie ever made in Europe, and the best on the subject...La Haine The first time I saw the movie in 2003, we was gonna watch it for school. At first I thought it was gonna be another french movie about a young french girl that got pregnant(we watched a lot of those in French lessons)...but what followed was probably the most defining 90 minutes in my life.When the movie started with the images of riots (real riots, old news footage) combined with Bob Marley's ""Burning and Looting"" I was getting fascinated about this movie, this had to be good. A lot of things were very recognizable, everyone knows a ""Said"", everyone knows a ""Hubert"" and at the time I was feeling like ""Vinz"". All the scenes influenced me and were very recognizable, the hanging around with friends, the way of talking, the arguments they used for their deeds...everything. The end shocked me and I couldn't really think anything else then ""I got to watch this movie again"", and the day after I bought a DVD of it.The movie tells the story of a black, Arab and Jewish guy who live in a housing project near Paris, the kind of neighborhood where most of the people don't have a job, where the youth bores itself and flirts with criminal behavior, where drugs are being sold and where an occasional riot starts (this happened from the 80's until recently from time to time). The movie follows them 24 hours after their friend Adbel got beat up by the police during the riots, where a cop lost his gun. Vinz (the Jewish guy) found the gun and swears that when Abdel dies he's gonna take vengeance by killing a police. With Vinz - not being the most stable nor the most smart and relaxed person - having a gun on him the three come in some hard situations, but also without the police gun they have enough problems during the 24 hours....I ain't gonna spoil anything, but this should be enough to make you wanting to watch this movie.After watching it a couple of times I realized that this was a story, I always thought it was a documentary, which is a big compliment to the whole crew I think. But still that didn't made the movie less strong, the greatest thing about it is that it isn't easy made, no clichés...when you watch an American movie on the subject there always is some form of exit for the main character or he dies in a way that makes you think he deserves it. So either way a character is portrayed as a nice guy or a total bad guy, who both have girl who want to get them out of troubles. This is where La Haine sets itself apart from other movies, it doesn't try to portray the characters as nice people, although you do feel sympathies for them. The best thing is the end, which sets the movie mostly apart and makes it more recognizable for the European crowd (I'm not gonna spoil it, but if it ended differently the movie wouldn't been so great) The way it is shot in black and white makes it look realer, makes it grimier, it portrays the banlieues as a place without an exit. That's what maybe sets the movie also apart, the black and white makes it look arty and grimy at the same time. Maybe the best is that it still doesn't look dated because of that.Another great thing is the soundtrack, all the songs that are used in the movie have a great effect on the images and visa versa. Bob Marley perfectly fits the riots, Isaac Hayes fits the hashish packing and smoking scenes, Zapp and Roger fits the break dance song perfectly and the Expression Direct fits the haunted car scene in inner city Paris perfect (if you can understand the lyrics). But what really sets this movie apart is the Cutkiller scene, this scene only made me wanted to get a set of SL1200's...The way the tension is build in the movie is great, most of the time the characters don't do anything, but you still feel the tension building, the hate growing, and when you maybe bored watching some scenes the first time (the ""candit-camera"" scene for instance and the ""eiffeltower"" scene), but afterwards they're like pieces of a puzzle falling into it's place. Some shots are brilliantly, the Taxi Driver imitation of Vinz at the beginning (when you already see that Vinz is losing it), the police interview shot with Said and Hubert, the discussion at the toilets, the way the characters are introduced, the subway shot...it's all eye candy.To make a conclusion, if you love hip hop and don't think the police as necessarily the representation of the good in society. of course when you love cinema it is also a good movie, but it really is a movie which has it own public: the youth. If your Dutch try to get hold of the 7 euro Freerecord shop version, but I can recommend the English 10 year anniversary more...the directors commentary, trailers and bonus material make this a really nice DVD. But I can understand why a lot of people don't like it, it doesn't offer solutions, it doesn't give an opinion on anything except the police, and of course you have to have a certain frame of mind to like the movie.",La Haine
