0,MartinHafer,But what if you don't particularly adore horses?!,5,29 January 2012,"I assume that there are two main groups of people--those who adore horses and think they are beautiful creatures as well as those, like me, who see them as a means of transportation or food (in a crunch--when beef isn't available). So, some see the film as magical--while others see it was incredibly empty. Unlike the Oscar folks (who have nominated it for Best Picture), I found the picture to be very episodic and I didn't particularly care for the characters--and some of this might be because I don't absolutely love horses (though I really have nothing against them).The film begins with the birth of a horse. A teen in a nearby farm has some sort of magical connection with the animal--which is darn fortuitous since his tenant farmer father ends up buying the beast. The horse and teen fall in love (no, not in the ""Equus"" way) but sadly the family is eventually forced to sell the horse because they simply cannot afford it. The horse is then bought by the military and is sent into WWI--where lots of death and carnage result in the horse bouncing from one owner to another until, as if by magic, it's reunited with the teen who loved him. Who really cares that 11,000,000 people were killed in the war--what really matters is a boy and his horsey.While this sounds like I hated the movie, I didn't. I liked the music, camera-work and way they recreated WWI--it was quite realistic. But with an Oscar nomination for the top honor, I found myself expecting so much more. The film's biggest deficit is that none of the characters were particularly likable or fully fleshed out--seeming awfully one-dimensional. Yes, it looked nice but I DON'T adore horses and thought the film was rather ponderous and episodic. Call me a horse-hater (I am really not) if you like--I just didn't connect with the film at all.",War Horse
1,TheLittleSongbird,Exceptional,10,15 January 2012,"Having seen War Horse just today with my family, I was just blown away at how wonderful the movie was. Steven Spielberg has been responsible for some of my childhood favourites such as ET, Jurassic Park, Jaws and Raiders of the Lost Ark, as well as Schindler's List and one of the compellingly real beginnings of all time in Saving Private Ryan. To me, he is a very talented director. War Horse may not be my favourite of his films, but it is one of his better ones in my opinions in recent years. The cinematography and scenery are truly gorgeous, and John Williams' music score(my favourite score of 2011) brings meaning to the terms beauty, epic and grandiose.I also loved the story. It was well-paced, especially at the start and compelling, yet also with Spielberg's unique magic touch. The spectacle itself is stirring especially the charge in No-Man's Land, which felt so real and intense without feeling too graphic. There is also a lot of poignancy. Joey's bolt through barbed wire consequently bringing two warring sides together stands out especially, but what really got me were the final scenes shot against a burning sunset, one of the most visually beautiful and emotionally poignant endings in recent memory to me.Spielberg does an outstanding job directing, the war scenes are authentic and harrowing without feeling too much so(they even include the consequences of desertion) and the poignant moments are so without being too mawkish. There's even a touch of humour particularly with the goose. As I said before though, War Horse still has the magic touch that makes the best of his movies so good. The script is genuinely heartfelt and effective, and the characters especially Albert, his parents, the grandfather and especially Joey are written in a way that makes you empathise with them. The script and characters in the war scenes manage not to be too clichéd, too one-sided or stereotypical as well.Acting is very good. Joey of course steals the show, he looks incredible and you identify with him every step of the way, and Jeremy Irvine is very convincing and passionate in his performance as Albert. Peter Mullan, Emily Watson and Niels Arestrup give affecting turns, and David Thewlis, Tom Hiddleston and Benedict Cumberbatch are also solid. Overall, an exceptional film, one of my favourites of the year that's for sure. 10/10 Bethany Cox",War Horse
2,bkoganbing,Joey,8,2 February 2015,"When you get right down to it War Horse is a reworking of Black Beauty on a much larger and more terrible stage, that of World War I. But Steven Spielberg does like to do entertainment on a grand scale and this boy and his horse story is both heart stirring and entertaining.As the horse named Joey is the star of the film it's not surprising that War Horse received no Oscar recognition in any of the acting categories. Besides for Best Picture, War Horse received 5 other Oscar nominations in technical categories, but not one of them brought home the statue for Spielberg.Young Jeremy Irvine gets the present of a lifetime when his amiable drunken father buys this championship race horse with the family savings. His mother takes to the acquisition of this horse the way Jack's mother took to Jack getting a handful of beans in Jack And The Beanstalk. But the horse becomes great friends with Irvine and actually takes to the plow.I'm sure that Joey longed for that plow when the horse is sold to the army. Irvine too goes off to war. The British think that cavalry will be the answer on the European western front, but they are soon disabused of that notion when the cavalry charge meets automatic weapons fire. It soon settles into the trench warfare that symbolized World War I on the French scene.After surviving the cavalry charge like Black Beauty, Joey goes through several situations and people, most of them not very good to him. The Germans use him to haul their heavy artillery as they did when they requisitioned French farm horses. No real care for the animals, they hauled until they died. A fate that this spirited animal was determined to avoid.If you know the plot of Black Beauty than you know what happens to Joey. Mr. Spielberg even with the violence of war has given us a nice family film and I recommend it highly.",War Horse
3,Leofwine_draca,Missed opportunity,5,28 November 2014,"I haven't read the acclaimed children's book by Michael Morpurgo on which this film is based, but I can't help but feel it's a missed opportunity. Like the later HARRY POTTER movies, it's a film which flies over the subject matter at speed, portraying multiple characters with their own little storyline and failing to connect the viewer with any of them on an emotional level.The film starts off with Peter Mullan playing another animal-hating character (after TYRANNOSAUR), and then suddenly we learn that the lead, Jeremy Irvine, has fallen in love with his horse. I didn't get that at all; there's no warmth in the screenplay, no reason for the care. Then things stir briefly for the war stuff, but it soon descends into the doldrums again. It picks up for a climax which should be emotionally devastating, but unfortunately it was one which left me cold inside.Part of the blame goes to Richard Curtis, for making his screenplay so mechanical, but the rest must go to Spielberg himself. Spielberg of late seems obsessed with crafting visually beautiful but ultimately hollow viewing experiences. Hell, I preferred the 1990s film adaptation of BLACK BEAUTY, even WITH Alan Cumming's unnecessary narration.",War Horse
4,SnoopyStyle,Steven Spielberg goes old timey,6,18 August 2013,"Farm boy Albert Narracott tries to enlist to fight in WWI after his horse Joey is sold to the calvary. The film follows the horse as he suffers through the war.Steven Spielberg directs this deliberate epic as we follow a horse from the farm to war and back to farm again. In between he encounters many different humans and that breaks up the story. Just as you get involved in one story, the horse leaves and a new story begins. It breaks up the pace and causes a real problem maintaining the tension.In many ways, this film feels like a relic from a by gone era. The action is big, but we don't see the grotesque blood splattering. People are killed but rarely take center stage. In one scene, a squad of mounted British soldier charge at German gun enplacements. In the next scene, only the horses charge out of the forest without their riders. We know most the riders have been killed, but Spielberg is choosing poetry over brutal authenticity. This isn't breaking any ground and isn't going to last in collective memory of the movie-going public about Spielberg.",War Horse
5,Hitchcoc,It's About the War,6,25 May 2012,"I agree that the plot is pretty sappy. If it wasn't so visually engaging I might have quit watching it. But what it does portray is a real image of war. If someone is going to be critical of the fact that horses were used in the war, it says that unless someone uses a subject you don't like, the movie isn't worth making. Yes it had all the elements of a sentimental movie. It would have really fit in well in the 1940's. Still, there is a thread running through it that allows us to root for the hero and hope that things can get better. Yes, we have some caricatures, but there were people who stood up against oppression. One even loses her life, which seemed quite a realistic result under the circumstances. The horses are horses. They don't transcend their species. They are driven by their instincts. Granted the horse in question does take on a bit of a supernatural presence. But he is the survivor horse, the one that doesn't die. That's what makes the story. This is not a great movie and it is very sentimental and totally unbelievable, but sappy stories were once the norm and we feel pretty good when it's over.",War Horse
6,Prismark10,War Horse,6,7 August 2020,"Steven Spielberg is a big fan of British directors such as Richard Attenborough, Carol Reed and Powell & Pressburger. In War Horse Spielberg is very much inspired by those directors as well as with a touch of John Ford with the orange hued sunset at the end of the movie.Taking Michael Morpurgo's novel which was turned into a stage play. Albert Narracott (Jeremy Irvine) forms a close friendship with Joey the horse his father bought at an auction to plough the field at their Devon farm.With the outbreak of World War 1. Financial burdens means that Joey is sold to a cavalry officer who promises Albert that the horse would be returned to him if they survive the war.The film follows Joey's fate as he is taken by the German army, adopted by a small girl in a French farm and then becomes trapped in no man's land.Technically, War Horse is an accomplished piece of film-making from Spielberg. It really is a master craftsman at the helm aided by his cinematographer Janusz Kaminski and a musical score from John Williams.It is emotionally stirring in places, yet it never quiet gels together. War Horse is a series of vignettes which charts Joey's journey throughout the first world war. The downside is that you are never invested in the characters as they are only with you for a short while. This includes Albert who tops and tails the movie.The anti war message from the book is lost. There are hints on the futility of war but the movie depicts the Germans here as more intelligent than the British when the first cavalry charge takes place.",War Horse
7,kosmasp,Playing Horse,6,3 May 2012,"Having a horse as your protagonist isn't easy. Just ask Mr. Spielberg himself (or read the article in the Empire Magazine where he elaborates on this). But it wouldn't be Spielberg if he couldn't handle it. He's also able to handle any comparisons to Ryan, by just avoiding shooting it the same way. And the cinematography is just plain superb in this! Even if you don't like the movie at all, you'll have to admit that. I liked the movie on the other hand, but not as much as the Academy apparently and other viewers here.I think the movie is too long (it not only feels like it, the running time would suggest I am right) and I am amazed that a seasoned director as Steven Spielberg would actually let his characters tell us what is going on on screen (considered a ""mistake"" by many). While I understand that I might be in the minority these are things that bother me in a large scale production such as this. The movie is good, but through these mistakes will not have a top spot in my list",War Horse
8,classicsoncall,"""Horses like this don't just appear from a fairy tale.""",9,19 May 2012,"Typically before I offer my own take on a film, I have a look at the positive and negative comments from a handful of other reviewers on this board, along with a selection from the most prolific authors category. Notably absent in the dozen or so postings I read was any mention of the animals used to film the picture. My impression was that the horses used to portray Joey and Topthorn were pretty remarkable animals. They were called on to do a wide ranging series of stunts and action sequences, and their performances were nothing short of extraordinary. Definitely more so than their human co-stars.While I found the direction and cinematography to be genuinely first rate, the thing that bothers me in stories like this is the magnitude of coincidence necessary to bring them to a successful conclusion. In fact, one of the characters made reference to the 'needle in a haystack' challenge of Albie (Jeremy Irvine) ever finding Joey again once they were separated at the start of the war. Could it happen across a foreign battlefield following multiple owners and a succession of enemy campaigns? Not only is Joey reunited with Albie at the finale, but the old Grand Pere (Niels Arestrup) is there as well, with his only explanation hinging on the battlefield survival of a miraculous horse. I can appreciate the attempt, but I also can understand how more than a handful of viewers would find this downright laughable.To put this in perspective, I did some quick research on the number of equine deaths in World War I, and though I couldn't come up with a single reliable figure, the estimates run into the hundreds of thousands. One shocking statistic I found had to do with the 1916 Battle of Verdun between French and German forces in which seven thousand horses died in a single day due to long range shelling on both sides. With those kinds of stats, the story of War Horse rises virtually to the impossible.The one thing I'd really like to find out was how the film makers engineered Joey's flight through the barb wire barricades and his hideous fall on the battlefield. Westerns from the Thirties and Forties were infamous for using trip wires, but I'm sure there was a more humane way to simulate it here, if it was even done with a live animal. This just brings me back to my initial comment about the animal talent used in the filming of the picture. Unlike Secretariat or Seabiscuit, these horses were doing a lot more than just running around a big old circle.",War Horse
9,lee_eisenberg,World War I is 100 years out,6,16 November 2018,"This past Sunday was the 100th anniversary of the armistice that ended the first global war, now known as World War I. That conflict that engulfed the planet for four years took the lives of an estimated 9 million combatants and 7 million civilians, not to mention those slaughtered in the Armenian Genocide and the people who later died as a result of the Spanish flu. There was officially no winner, and the only real result was that the empires of the Central Powers - Germany, Austria-Hungary, Bulgaria and the Ottoman Empire - dissolved, and other empires took over their former colonies (Armenia got reduced to a fraction of its former size, while the Palestinians, Yazidis and Kurds didn't even get their own countries). It resulted in a lost generation, while the reparations imposed on Germany led to Hitler's rise to power.Which brings us to Steven Spielberg's ""War Horse"". Around the time of its release I read a review which criticized its emphasis on the relation between the characters and the title equine amid a horrendous global war that senselessly took millions of lives. Now that I've gotten around to seeing it - for the centenary of the armistice - I got that feeling also. Is any war an appropriate setting for a look at the relations between to characters?Which is not to say that the movie doesn't have its upsides. It doesn't flinch in showing the horrors of the battlefield, as well as the filthy setting (I doubt that any movie can portray it 100% accurately). Another credit is that it shows South Asian troops in the British army, brief though that scene is; a criticism of last year's ""Dunkirk"" was that it depicted an all-white battalion, even though large numbers of Indian and Pakistani troops participated in the Dunkirk evacuation. The scene where the horse runs away from the tank reminded me of the end of ""Catch-22"", with the main character realizing that there's nothing to be gained from the war. The subsequent scene of the characters joining forces to help the horse gave me a feeling of the Christmas truce (when British and German troops stopped fighting for a few minutes and talked to each other, seeing each other as humans for a few brief moments).Basically, it's an OK movie, not a great one. ""Schindler's List"" it's not. It's OK seeing, if only once.",War Horse
10,jboothmillard,War Horse,8,26 January 2012,"From writer Richard Curtis (Blackadder, Four Weddings and a Funeral, Notting Hill), and director Steven Spielberg (Jaws, Raiders of the Lost Ark, E. T. the Extra-Terrestrial, Schindler's List, Saving Private Ryan), I saw the poster and assumed it might be a hit, and then I heard there were mixed opinions, but in fact it was a hit, and one I had to see. Basically, set in 1914, Dartmoor, Devon, England, farmer Ted Narracott (Neds' Peter Mullan) needs a horse to plough his fields, but he instead buys a thoroughbred, as he was bidding against his landlord Lyons (Harry Potter's David Thewlis), and Ted's wife Rose (Emily Watson) is dismayed by this. Their teenage son Albert (Jeremy Irvine) however, who witnessed the horse, named Joey, being born, has faith in the animal and that he can train him to plough and be ridden for other tasks, but it will be no easy task. As time goes by, and the time is running out for the ploughing to be done for payment, Joey does successfully manage to do it, he and Albert have become inseparable friends, but they are all devastated when the crops fail to grow properly in the harvest, and Ted is forced to sell him off. Albert promises Joey that they will be reunited, and the horse is shipped to France with the British Army, as the World War has started, and he will be used as a charging horse, ridden by Captain Nicholls (Tom Hiddleston) into battle. Led by Major Jamie Stewart (Sherlock's Benedict Cumberbatch) the British soldiers encounter a disastrous offensive, and in the battle Joey ends up captured by the Germans, and the horse grows attached to the black horse Topthorn as they pull ambulance wagons. German soldiers and brothers Gunther (David Kross) and Michael (Leonard Carow) are the ones who have Joey, and they take him to Italy where another battle occurs, and the brothers are shot, with Joey and Topthorn are left inside a windmill. They are found by young French girl Emilie (Celine Buckens) who lives on a farm with her Grandfather (The Diving Bell and the Butterfly's Niels Arestrup) and has brittle bones, which means she should not ride a horse, but she is allowed to on her birthday. While the two horses are again captured by Germans and it is 1918, Albert has enlisted in the British Army during the Second Battle of the Somme, being commanded by the son of Lyons, David (Robert Emms), they go into a dangerous gas attack along with bombings and guns blazing. The two horses manage to survive their years pulling German military equipment, but Topthorn does eventually succumb to exhaustion and dies in the battlefield, but Joey runs for his life through the trenches, into no-man's land, until he runs into and gets tangled up in barbed wire. The bombing and firing has stopped on the battlefield, and the British soldiers see there is something moving on it, and when they know it is a horse Geordie soldier Colin (Toby Kebbell) ignores his orders to stay and goes to help the animal, and German soldier Peter (Hinnerk Schönemann) comes out as well to give him a hand. They ignore their countries' rivalry to help the poor horse, and after a coin flip to see who gets to look after the horse the British take Joey in, but he is very badly injured that they are saying he may need to be put out of his misery. We see that Albert has survived the gas attack, but he has been temporarily blinded, so he has bandages to cover his eyes, but he is told about a ""miracle horse"", and he recognises this may be his friend, and with his owl whistle he stops them shooting the horse for euthanasia. Joey is proved to be Albert's horse by his distinctive marks that he identifies from memory, and when his eye sight is restored, and the horse is cared back to health, Albert finds out the horse will be auctioned to high bidders, but Albert does not win, it is Emilie's Grandfather that wins. He planned to take the horse home as Emilie has died and he wanted him back for the sake of her memory, and even with pleading Albert looks like he won't get his friend back, but Joey goes to him, and the old man allows him to go with his rightful owner, Ted and Rose are surprised and happy to see Joey returned home as well. Irvine gives a good heartfelt performance as the young man who cares for the thoroughbred, and all the supporting actors like Cumberbatch, Hiddleston and Arestrup do their parts very well also, but of course the star horse of the title is the character you most empathise with. Of course the whole film isn't from the perspective of Joey the horse, there are the scenes of fighting and battle that really compel you with the explosions and soldiers charging, there are some great landscape sequences and great sweeping camera-work, Spielberg makes sure not to be too schmaltzy and as usual to get your emotions going, a most worthwhile First World War drama. It was nominated the Oscars for Best Art Direction, Best Cinematography, Best Music, Original Score for John Williams, Best Sound Editing, Best Sound Mixing, and Best Motion Picture of the Year, it was nominated the BAFTAs for Best Cinematography, Best Original Music, Best Production Design, Best Sound, and Best Special Visual Effects, and it was nominated the Golden Globes for Best Motion Picture - Drama, and Best Original Score.

12,tavm,Steven Spielberg's War Horse is another of his masterpieces,10,12 January 2012,"Just watched this Steven Spielberg-directed movie with my movie theatre-working friend today. It tells the story of a horse named Joey, his early trials in being trained by a young man named Albert before being sold to the Army during World War I. From there, Joey gets in several adventures with others before...Oh, watch the movie. All I'll say now is Spielberg has made a very touching and intense drama which is perfectly accompanied by another magnificent score by John Williams who as always is perfectly matched with this great director especially considering their nearly 40 years of collaboration. Really, all I'll say now is don't miss War Horse.",War Horse
13,edwagreen,"They Requisition Horses, Don't They? ***",8,25 December 2012,"What's the big fuss regarding this movie. It is essentially a war story, in this case, World War 1 with Joey the Horse. Naturally, a Spielberg movie wouldn't be complete without the music coming from John Williams and the photography from Janusz Kaminski.To me, this movie is ""National Velvet"" in World War 1 mode. A boy who enlists literally follows the horse he gave up throughout Europe during the first world war. It's really about the exploits of the horse. Both sides seemed to be quite difficult in their handling of horses. Of course, the scene where Joey is set free by both an English and German soldier just shows that human understanding can even take place during war-time.The beginning of the film was far better when a drunken father purchases Joey instead of a horse for plowing. It showed the dedication of his son in trying to train the horse for the plow. I feel that the film went down with the coming of war, of course, since when is any war really good?",War Horse
14,hitchcockthelegend,"Walk on Joey, walk on.",9,7 December 2012,"War Horse is directed by Steven Spielberg and adapted to screenplay by Richard Curtis and Lee Hall from the novel of the same name written by Michael Morpurgo. It stars Jeremy Irvine, Peter Mullan, David Thewlis, Tom Hiddlestone, Benedict Cumberbatch, Emily Watson, Toby Kebbell, Niels Arestrup and Celine Buckens. Music is scored by John Williams and cinematography by Janusz Kaminski. 1914 England and Albert Narracott (Irvine) forms a friendship with a horse his father has purchased to plough the family farm. Naming the horse Joey, and with training and bond in place, Albert is devastated when financial problems in the family mean Joey is sold into the British cavalry. As World War 1 rages, Joey winds up in different ownership, but are Albert and Joey fated to ever be together again?Sentiment gets banded around a lot in film fan circles like it's a dirty word, yet those using it the most are at a loss to explain just what exactly is wrong with sentiment in film? All the basic emotions available to the human being are called upon by film makers, they are used to illicit a prescribed response from the viewer, but when it's sentiment it's a bad thing. This notion is ridiculous, almost as ridiculous as the notion that film makers make films purely to try and win an Oscar! But that again is something I have yet had explained to me properly, this whole Oscar Bait concept. Really it's laughable, and using sentimentality and Oscar Bait as a core basis for hating on a film is as lazy as it gets.There are big days and small days, which will it be?War Horse is rich in sentiment, and it's crafted by one of the masters of such emotion. It finds Steven Spielberg on top family film making form, a return to the type of heart tugging story telling not seen from The Beard since he introduced Elliot's alien pal into our lives. In the same year that he dabbled in new techno trickery with Tintin, Spielberg offers up the flip side with War Horse, it's very old school, and while he homages his directing heroes of old, he showcases his own skills behind the camera, a Spielberg stamp so often ignored by his sentimental hating detractors. A shot in the reflection of a horses eye, a segue from a knitting pattern into our protagonists busying away on the farm, the deft use of a windmill sail or crane shots capturing the death and devastation of war, Spielberg isn't all about tinkering with the tear ducts. Credit, too, the skill with which he films the equine stars, big characters with big characteristics that leave the viewer in no doubt what these magnificent beasts are feeling.It's also a treat of a film for the eyes and ears, a Blu-ray must in fact. Kaminski's photography is at times simply stunning, particularly for the sequences at the Devon farm, while Williams' score swirls around the pictures on screen before seeping into the ear drums and finding its way into the heart. Where the film fails is that the humans are merely observers to the story, serving only as pop up characters in vignettes. Even Albert, the key human character, is absent for far too long. Yes we understand it's primarily about the horse, the title kind of gives that away! But there's a key friendship between man and beast, from foal to finale, that warranted us knowing what Albert was up to as Joey traverses the battlefields of the war. The horse focus also means many from the impressive cast list are wasted, but there's enough from the likes of Hiddlestone, Arestrup, Kebbell and Cumberbatch to compliment the fine ground work laid by Mullan and Watson.Yep, there's some minor flaws and those averse to Spielberg's twanging of the heart strings should have the good sense to stay away in the first place. But at a time when the world is in a mess, a Spielberg film of friendship and hope is good medicine. His ability to easily shift from the horrors of the Somme to something tender in no man's land is unerring in its double impact value. To hold us enthralled as we follow a horse of big heart as it impacts so greatly on those it comes into contact with, is no small feat. Yes, it's sentimental, but really what is wrong with that? A beautiful and moving film made in the grandest of old school epic traditions. 9/10",War Horse
15,Doylenf,"An absorbing, entertaining obstacle course for a splendid boy and horse story...",7,27 December 2011,"WAR HORSE conjures up feelings I had when I first read BLACK BEAUTY years ago, the saga of a horse who went from owner to owner amid a series of mostly unhappy circumstances. The difference here is the background (World War I), the luscious farm scenes that start the tale, the colorful faces of the village folk, and at the center of the tale, an earnest and good-looking lad (Jeremy Irvine) who adapts the horse and must turn it into a plow horse so his family can retain their farm.And when the war comes, the grim scenes of battle offer a stark contrast to the sentimental scenes at the start, as the horse proves himself to be a fine specimen until he is caught in a barbed wire situation that requires the assistance of British and German soldiers to put aside the war while they free him from suffering and pain.The usual bombastic score that John Williams gave many of Spielberg's action films is missing here. Instead, there are delicate melodies played brilliantly on flute for the lighter moments and impressive richer sounds for the dramatic highlights. It's a lovely piece of craftsmanship.So is the film, which shows a high level of craftsmanship throughout, the settings and costumes realistic, the performances beyond reproach, and the sentimental happy ending so welcome after all the audience has been through with the brave war horse. Credit must go to Steven Spielberg for his detailed direction.By all means, one of the best Spielberg films to come along in a long time. Jeremy Irvine is perfectly cast in the leading role and all of the supporting players are well cast, particularly Emily Watson, David Thewlis, Peter Mullan, Neil Arestrup and Benedict Cumberbatch.Solid entertainment, it holds the interest throughout despite its length.",War Horse
16,LeonLouisRicci,Childhood Fantasy of Pulp Proportion,6,17 July 2012,"The films of Steven Spielberg are of varying importance and some are vastly overrated. This one falls in the trenches of the less impressive and more standard. By old school traditional Hollywood, days gone by standard. One cannot fail to be overwhelmed by the homage and deliberate attempt to reflect some of the most famous scenes in the most famous movies. The style, presentation, and obvious retro feel and look of the movie are purposeful and unashamed. This was the intent and your feeling about this movie will depend on your longing for those wonderful days of yesteryear. When an animal could have a series of films (Rin Tin Tin, Francis, Lassie) without apology and nothing more of a purpose than to entertain, uplift, and make you feel good.War Horse is a rather shallow story despite its scope and the amount of mileage and owners our beloved ""Joey"" (the horse) experiences. No one he encounters seems to be other than a plot device to lead him from one set piece to another. There is never real deep involvement as it all wants to rush us through the grandeur and the gallantry of it all. So it flatly finalizes with a complete circle from farm to fighting to farm with a rather artificial array of action that is like a childhood fantasy of pulp proportion. Maybe that is exactly what it is suppose to be. Nothing profound just perfunctory, just an afternoon at the bijou.",War Horse
17,CinemaSerf,"It's not trying to be the book, or the play - it's succeeding at being a good film...",7,24 February 2021,"Cynics need not apply. This film - and indeed the whole ""War Horse"" story - is a sentimentally charged fountain of serendipitous events that require you to suspend any sense of realism and just let your senses find their own way through the next 2½ hours. We start with an auction where a young colt is bought at by a poverty-stricken farmer (Peter Mullen). Now he was supposed to buy a working horse to help plough their inhospitable and rocky farm. Instead, he substantially overpays for a thoroughbred (""Joey"") - an independently minded, athlete of an horse that has never been ridden, let alone dragged a plough around for a living! The son of the household, ""Albert"" (Jeremy Irvine) determines to try and befriend the horse and so creates an enduring bond. That, despite a separation forced on them by the atrocities of the Great War that sees ""Joey"" sold to Tom Hiddleston before being captured by the Bosche, befriended by a young girl and her grandfather and finally extricated from the carnage of no-man's land by a rare and poignant bit of Christmas Day-style co-operation. Of course, the story is far fetched but it is none the less effective for that. The story of the horse has a continuing thread all of it's own, but then so do each of the people whose life he touches. The ghastliness of war is writ large, as is the prevailing determination of Steven Spielberg to somehow humanise the inhumane - by using an equine actor. It's effective too, for the most part. Irvine is good looking, charming and well cast, as is Toby Kebbell who appears towards the end. The production is of the highest standard, the photography and effects impressive, and the dlalogue refreshingly allows the visuals to do most of the work - a clever and potent abridgement of Peter Morpurgo's original. There really is nothing not to like with this. It is splendid big screen cinema at it's best and well worth a cinema outing if you get a chance.",War Horse

Yet interspersed with the cheesy made- for-kids moments are some pretty horrific war scenes. Therein lies Steven Spielberg's error: you can't have a Disney war movie. Meant to be emotional, the emotion is contrived (mostly through the music). I found it hard to care about the horse, especially as you have thousands of soldiers dying on either side, and we are expected to care more about the well being of a horse.Overly long: takes a while to get moving, and then just meanders.In addition, it is historically and militarily inaccurate (which is unusual for Spielberg, as he directed Saving Private Ryan and produced the superb series Band of Brothers).Performances are so-so. In keeping with the Disney feel, most performances feel patronising and trite. No standouts.On the plus side, the production values are excellent. Cinematography and special effects are great (as you would expect from Spielberg).",War Horse

21,Boba_Fett1138,The horses were the highlights and I'm not even a horse person. So perhaps that tells you something about this movie.,6,8 January 2012,"Sentimental or rather said over-sentimental is about the most used word you will hear or read, in reference to this movie. I however could handle the sentimentalism of this movie for most part (though it gets pretty bad toward the end) but that however does not mean I was very fond of the movie as well.Really my biggest complaint about the movie remains its storytelling. The story itself was perhaps also not that good and suitable enough to begin with but the storytelling just doesn't make things much better. It's needlessly messy and convoluted because it attempts to use the horse as its main character and lets everything in the movie evolves around him. However the movie constantly makes you wonder why it does this. First of all; a horse is just a horse and this is a horse like every other. It's not like the horse can talk or has any super powers, yet every character in the movie seems to be highly affected by his presence and all fall in love with it at first sight. But the movie never really gives you enough reasons to explain why- and what it is exactly that makes this horse so special. And second of all; no matter how good the animal training for these horses used were, you still need good, solid human characters as well, to help capture the movie its heart and drama. This is something the movie seems to be lacking.The horse switches owners constantly, throughout the entire movie. Like a Forrest Gump of the 1910's he's galloping his way through a war struck Europe and every time he changes hands, it tells you a new story, from a different WW I involved perspective. This is an approach, that I am convinced off, works out better on paper than in a movie. I am sure that the novel, this movie is based on, is good but within a movie this approach does not work out too well. It makes the movie needlessly long and every time you start to get into a certain story or character, it's over already. It starts to make you feel detached from all of the events and emotions of the movie, after a while. It would had been fine if Jeremy Irvine's character had been present throughout the entire movie and the movie would had followed his entire story as well, instead of focusing on the story of the horse alone.But don't worry, there still is plenty to like about this movie. It by no means is an horrible one and it also never becomes dreadful to watch, in any way.I for instances was really impressed with the horses, used in this movie. Animals are always hard to work with for film-makers but the animal were superbly trained it seemed. Their interaction with the other characters and the timing was spot on. It probably was the most impressive thing about this movie.But of course also technically and visually there is very little wrong with this movie. It's tightly made, with obviously a large budget behind it. It's a great looking period piece, with also every so often, some spectacular looking war moments. The cinematography by Janusz Kaminski is also simply stunning. It's one of those movies you could pause at any moment and the images you see will look just like a painting.The movie is also featuring a finally true good John Williams musical score again. For a while it seemed like he had lost it but with this movie he showed he still is at the top of his game, despite the fact he is almost 80 now.Not an horrible movie by any means and still real skillfully made but I think and feel this will be one of those Spielberg's most will forget about in 20 years, or so, from now.6/10 http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",War Horse

Steven Spielberg's epic homage to John Ford (with distinct echoes of HOW GREEN WAS MY VALLEY) is on full display in his wonderful approach to the vastly popular story & play about the WWI parable about the unparalleled passion of an adolescent farm boy (newcomer Irvine) and his magnificent horse – only to be literally separated by the emerging European conflict unleashed. The wonderful, beautiful horse is the true star 'emoting' capably and manipulating the viewers' heartstrings in the process brilliantly with its adventures abroad while its master attempts to reunite despite the worldwide calamity. With expert cinematography by longtime collaborative force Janusz Kiminski (with truly gorgeous sequences) and a wonderful ensemble Spielberg capably creates an instant classic with masterpiece filmmaking and an excellent adaptation of Michael Morpurgo's novel by Lee Hall and Richard Curtis. One of the year's very best films!",War Horse
23,neil-476,Excellent - moving and harrowing,9,20 January 2012,"English author Michael Morpurgo wrote War Horse as a children's book, an anti-war story using the then little-known matter of the number of horses used to death in World War I as its subject matter, and told from the horse's point of view. The National Theatre in London had the rather bizarre idea of adapting this book for the stage, which they did using puppets in one of the most astonishingly effective pieces of stagecraft in the history of theatre - if you are anywhere near a theatre presenting War Horse then I urge you to go and see it, no matter how many months ahead you have to book - it will blow you away. The stage show, of course, no matter how far ahead it is sold out, will only reach thousands: Spielberg's film version, based on the show as much as the book, will reach millions. And deservedly so.Although this is not a perfect film, it is extremely good: I only have two criticisms, one technical and one artistic (and that one may not actually be a criticism at all). The technical point is that, in the early section set in Devon, there are a couple of moments when Spielberg's longstanding cinematographer Janusz Kaminski lets him down, when you can see multiple shadows cast by the lighting set up. And, artistically, although this is essentially a sentimental piece, it never quite has the heart-wrenching immediacy of the stage show.It is a gorgeous looking film, both in the bucolic early section in rural England and then in the spectacular but appalling war sections. And, notwithstanding the fact that it is relatively tame in terms of how graphically war is displayed (as contrasted with Saving Private Ryan, for instance), the section where Joey is running through No Man's Land joins the abandonment of David in AI as two of the most harrowing pieces of cinema I have ever seen.I'm not going to sing the praises of individual elements. I'll just say - go and see it. I saw it in a crowded cinema with a predominantly older audience, and they applauded at the end: not something which happens often.",War Horse
24,evanston_dad,A Stinking Pile of Horse Manure,2,1 June 2012,"A woeful movie that possibly challenges ""Amistad"" as Steven Spielberg's very worst film.""War Horse"" is an episodic tale of a -- you guessed it -- horse and its journey through the hell of World War I. Because the film spends no more than a few minutes on each set of characters the horse comes across, and because a horse is a rather uninteresting main character, the film has no narrative momentum, a fact that is not helped by its running time of 2:30.Spielberg's version of WWI is so simplistic that my three-year-old could have understood this film, leaving those of us who don't need to be treated like we're imbeciles by a movie director feeling grumpy that we're being so condescended to. The horse is maybe meant to symbolize something, but whatever that something might be, Spielberg is so thuddingly literal that it becomes actually insulting to think the horrors of the Great War can be encapsulated by the story of whether or not a young boy is ever reunited with his pet.Just to make sure we know how we're supposed to feel at every turn of the way, all of the good characters are gentle and kind and love horses, and all of the bad characters are gruff and smoke cigarettes and are mean to horses. That may give you some kind of indication as to the type of film you're in for.Grade: F",War Horse
25,ferguson-6,The Soldier that He is,7,28 December 2011,"Greetings again from the darkness. In the opening sequence of ""Saving Private Ryan"", director Steven Spielberg provided us with one of the most horrific and terrifyingly realistic and violent examples of war ever shown on screen. Here, he takes a much different approach. Though the bulk of the movie takes place during World War I, Spielberg manages to withhold the brutal atrocities, while never once losing the impact and fear experienced by the soldiers. And while it's uncertain whether this approach makes for a better film, it is obviously a more accessible and uplifting story because of it.Based on the children's book by Michael Morpurgo, and of course on the hugely successful stage runs in both London and New York, this movie is really the story of an unbreakable bond between a sincere farm boy named Albert (newcomer Jeremy Irvine) and a majestic horse named Joey. We witness the early bonding and training sessions between the two, which allows us to swallow some of the more improbable coincidences later in the story. When the war breaks out, Albert's dad (Peter Mullan) sells the horse to the cavalry so that he can save the farm by paying the landlord (David Thewlis). Fortunately, Captain Nicholls (Tom Hiddleston) agrees to keep Joey as his personal horse and return him to Albert after the war.War is unpredictable, and Joey gets passed from the British to the Germans to a French farmer's daughter, back to the Germans and back to the British. Along the way, we witness what a remarkable creature the horse is. Were he a man, he would be a most decorated officer. Instead, we witness how little value the military places on animals ... even the beautiful ones. There are numerous scenes that make will make you uncomfortable with the cruelty shown, but just as many that will make you smile with joy. The already famous scene that features Joey's unfortunate conflict with barbed wire and fence posts will have you squirming in your seat, while also scratching your head in wonderment.Though many of the events and sequences are a bit of a stretch to believe (the time-out in No Man's Land), the one thing you will never doubt is the beauty of the film. It's epic nature recalls ""Doctor Zhivago"" or ""Lawrence of Arabia"" (though not at the overall level of either of those films), and the photography reminds me of John Ford's best work. Off the top of my head, I would say it is the most beautifully photographed movie since Terrence Malick's ""Days of Heaven"" in 1978. Spielberg's long time DP Janusz Kaminski is at his best here and will surely be recognized for his cinematography by the Academy.Many of the British actors are recognizable (Emily Watson, Benedict Cumberbatch, Toby Kebbell, Eddie Marsan, David Kross), but it's key that Spielberg cast no ""movie stars"", only quality actors. The stars of the film and the story are the horse and the visuals. It should also be noted that the great John Williams delivers another perfect score ... one that would run away with the Oscar in many years.No need to be frightened off because the story is based during World War I. It's not for the youngest of kids, but this is an uplifting, sentimental and emotional movie for most everyone. It is peak Spielberg working with sentiments and subject matter with which he so excels.",War Horse
26,anaconda-40658,Well Ridden Horse.,9,25 February 2016,"War Horse (2011): Dir: Steven Spielberg / Cast: Jeremy Irvine, Emily Watson, Peter Mullan, David Thewlis, Tom Hiddleston: Steven Spielberg's magnificent tribute to animals that put their trust in humans only to be betrayed to the sins of war. This is a different viewpoint of war as seen previously in his film Saving Private Ryan, which regarded the toils of humanity and the unforgiving wages of war. Jeremy Irvine plays the young owner who raises the horse, Joey after being bought by his drunken father. Joey was intended as a plough horse but ultimately shifts from one owner to another after being sold to a soldier by the father. Irvine also goes off to war vowing to bring his horse back. How this resolves is one of the great sequences in the film. Peter Mullan plays his father whose drunken state causes misjudgement as when he uses all of his property rent to buy a horse that is deemed unfit to do the job he has in mind. He fought in the war, which is an element that brings realization as to why he feels two steps behind. Emily Watson plays his wife and Irvine's mother who loves her husband and encourages her son but feels frustrated. There are many interesting characters surface to own the horse such as two brothers in war, and a daughter and her uncle who are oppressed by the Germans. David Thewlis is unfortunately cardboard as the businessman out to possess Mullan's property. Another great epic from Spielberg including a tense scene where the horse is faced with a tank and trapped by barb wire wondering whether he will hear that familiar peaceful whistle again.

27,phd_travel,Absolutely wonderful - a powerhouse of war and emotion,10,5 January 2012,"See this one on the big screen - it's stunning and emotionally breath taking. The premise is a young boy (Albert) rears a horse (Joey), and follows it to World War I. You'll soon realize it's so much more than a story about a boy and his horse - it's actually one of the best war movies in years.I saw the play and was really impressed by the emotional impact and the epic sweep that was conveyed on a stage. So I was really curious to see how a movie and particularly Spielberg could enlarge on the play and he did better than I hoped for. The story is so good that it really carried through and this movie is one of the most gripping emotionally on screen for years. I can understand why Spielberg was in such a rush to make this movie even before it's Broadway run had ended.There are some things that are brought to life by the movie that just can't be shown on stage. The beauty of the countryside in England and France is one of them as the cinematography is perfect. The battle scenes are very exciting and gripping without being gory. The trenches and the wasteland of WWI battlefields are visually spot on. In fact it's one of the best films showing WWI battles. Here, Spielberg did a good job of balancing horror of war without being graphic like in Saving Private Ryan or the Iwo Jima movies. So it's suitable for the family too.It's hard to get animals to behave on film - so by whatever combination of effects and the real animal they managed to get it done and the results are magical. So much better than watching animation for kids.There is an expansion of storyline and characters from the play. Sympathetic characters who come across Joey the horse are added from Germany and France. The only fault I think was adding a couple of extra obstacles (the second auction and the French grandfather) after Albert found Joey that wasn't in the play - I think it diluted the climax of the movie. The cast is well chosen all round - from the superb Emily Watson to newcomer Jeremy Irvine as Albert who does a good job at being moving without being over emotional. It's good the accents of the multinational characters aren't too heavy so most can understand what they are saying. There are so many touching moments from parting to rescue that can move one to tears (over a horse). The anti war message is very effective because it shows the impact of war from so many perspectives human and animal. There are no individual villains - it's the war itself that is everyone's enemy.It's an unforgettable movie that took a long path from novel to play to the screen. It should be seen by all more than once.",War Horse
28,gradyharp,Perhaps we need more stories like this just now,10,5 April 2012,"There are many detractors for this very long (146 minutes) film, complaining that it is too emotional, too melodramatic, too 'Lassie Come Home', to over the top as a tearjerker, too Steven Spielberg and John Williams, et cetera. Well, it has all those elements but depending on the emotional vulnerability of the viewer the film can easily become a catharsis during this period of time when very little makes sense and the need for positive input into matters of the heart has rarely been more keen. Not having seen the stage play based on the book of the same name by acclaimed children's writer Michael Morpurgo, adapted for stage by Nick Stafford, this viewer is at a disadvantage in judging the story alone as here it is enhanced by gorgeous cinematography and amazingly realistic battle scenes. Lee Hall and Richard Curtis created the screenplay and seem to have allowed a proscenium stage story to expand into the spaces a play can only describe, and Steven Spielberg has taken it from there.The time of the story in set in Devon, England. To his wife Rose's (Emily Watson) dismay war injured and silenced farmer Ted Narracott (Peter Mullan) buys a thoroughbred horse rather than a plough animal that might save their leased farm form landowner Lyons (David Thewlis), but when his teenaged son Albert (Jeremy Irvine) trains the horse and calls him Joey, the two becoming inseparable, Albert does indeed manage to train Joey how to plough fields. When his harvest fails due to rain, Ted has to sell Joey to an army captain (Tom Hiddleston) who takes the horse into the battlefields of World War I the British cavalry and he is shipped to France. After a disastrous offensive he is captured by the Germans and changes hands twice more before he is found, caught in the barbed wire in No Man's Land four years later and freed in a scene between a British soldier and a German soldier that is one of the most memorable scenes in the film. Joey is returned behind British lines where Albert, now a private, has been temporarily blinded by gas, but still recognizes his beloved Joey. However, as the Armistice is declared Joey is set to be auctioned off. The results of the final auction seals the fate of the extraordinary lad and horse relationship in a most touching way.There are many, many cameo roles in the film that though brief are extremely well delivered: Niels Arestrup is the wise grandfather to the young Emilie (Celine Buckens) who rescues Joey for a while; Toby Kebbell is excellent as Geordie Soldier as is David Kross as the kind German soldier Gunther whose younger brother Friedrich (Nicolas Bro) he protects, and Hinnerk Schönemann shines as the German solder who helps rescue Joey from the barbed wire in No Man's Land. Leonard Carow, Matt Milne, Robert Emms, and Eddie Marsan are likewise memorable.The breathtaking cinematography is by Janusz Kaminski and the at times lugubrious musical score is by longtime Spielberg associate, composer John Williams. The story aims for the heart and finds its mark - and there is nothing wrong with that. Perhaps this film is much needed right now. Grady Harp",War Horse

31,JamesHitchcock,"Can Rival ""Schindler's List"" in Quality",9,1 March 2012,"Michael Morpurgo's ""War Horse"" is, like Anna Sewell's ""Black Beauty"", a novel for children told from the viewpoint of a horse, in this case a horse which serves on both sides during World War I. The book was later adapted for the stage, becoming one of the recent success stories of the London theatre, and coming to the attention of Steven Spielberg.The early scenes are set in Devon during the years leading up to the outbreak of war, and tell how the horse, Joey, is acquired by the farming Narracott family. Although these scenes do not deal with the war directly, they are of crucial importance to the film's main theme for two reasons. Firstly, they show the close relationship which grows up between Joey and the family's teenage son, Albert. Secondly, they introduce the film's anti-war theme. We learn that Albert's father, Ted, fought in the Boer War and was decorated for bravery after being wounded in action, but has always refused to take any credit for what he did, arguing that killing people should never be a matter for pride. Ted's regimental pennant will play an important role in later scenes.The remainder of the film follows Joey's fortunes throughout the war as he serves first as the mount of a British cavalry officer, then, after a brief period as the pet of a French farmer and his granddaughter Emilie, pulling heavy guns for the German artillery. Although armies during the First World War were still heavily dependent upon horses, on the Western Front at least they were largely used as draught animals. (On the Eastern Front mounted cavalry still played an important role). The story is not told entirely from Joey's viewpoint, but also from the viewpoints of those humans- Albert, Emilie and her grandfather, two young German soldiers named Gunther and Michael- with whom he comes into contact.Although the film was made by one of America's most famous directors, it is officially regarded as a British picture and does not include any American actors; to his credit Spielberg resisted the temptation to use America's entry into the war in 1917 as an excuse to modify Morpurgo's plot so as to include a role for a big Hollywood name. Indeed, there are no really big British names in the film, apart from David Thewlis in the minor role of Ted's landlord and Emily Watson in the rather larger one of Albert's mother Rose. The French and German roles are filled by actors of those respective nationalities, although all the dialogue is in English. The film is really an example of ensemble acting with no one role dominating the film; even Albert, probably the most important character, is absent from the action for a lengthy period in the middle of the film. (The young newcomer Jeremy Irvine is excellent in that role).As I said, the film has an anti-war theme, although this message is not rammed down the viewer's throat. We do see the loss and suffering- to both men and animals- caused by war, but perhaps its most eloquent statement is about how war makes enemies of those who have no cause to hate one another and who, under other circumstances, might even be friends; Gunther and Michael, for example, are executed by their own former comrades for attempted desertion. A key scene comes when Joey escapes and runs into no-man's land where he gets entangled in barbed wire. Two soldiers- Colin, an Englishman and Peter, a German- both set out to rescue him, and the two find a mutual respect based upon their joint enterprise. Two men who, by all the rules of war, should be trying to kill one another, put aside the enmity of their two countries to save the life of a horse. (Ownership of the horse is finally decided by the toss of a coin).In the past I have not always been Spielberg's greatest admirer; his action-adventure films, although often well-made in themselves, can be little more than old-style B-movies writ large, whereas his attempts at seriousness (""The Color Purple"", ""Saving Private Ryan"", etc) can often seem slow-moving and ponderous. At his best, however, he is capable of making excellent films, in particular ""Schindler's List"". With its well-staged action sequences, its fine contributions from its ensemble cast, its message of hope and its powerful emotions which never descend into mere sentimentality, Spielberg has, with ""War Horse"", at long last produced something which can rival ""Schindler's List"" in quality. 9/10",War Horse
32,lasttimeisaw,War Horse,7,29 February 2012,"Saw Spielberg's latest WWI epic film in the cinema, although I'm not qualified as an animal zealot, I have yet seriously raised any pets (the most intimate contact is two goldfishes once I had at home). But film-wise, it is an overall solid work from Spielberg, far from his best, but still a magnificent viewing occurrence.All the elements packing up in the film are slightly deja-vu from Spielberg's oeuvre, the different episodes through which our protagonist horse progresses are patchily distributed, particularly the one centers on the French girl and her grandfather (Celine Buckens is annoyingly snobbish in her over-fabricated role, namely the rolling down of a tear through her cheek scene is loathsomely designed, which is also dramatically underscored in the trailer), which backfires with an incongruously dreamed-up sentiment against the gruesomeness of the warfare. The human race cast is generically on their routine route without any over-exposition, which escalates the horse Joey to distinguish itself as the default tearjerker here, and even though everything is fictional, I feel agonizing to witness animals to being coerced to labor heavily just to earn back some human tears, it is not a fair play as we could never procure any consensus from them. I give the film a 7/10 despite all these said disconcerting factors, cinematically speaking, Janusz Kaminski's fabulous cinematography (the final scene of the reunion of the solider and his family is picturesquely stunning) and John William's enchanting score is marvelous in its own stake, but with regard to Mr. Spielberg, as long as I admire THE ADVENTURES OF TIN TIN 2011, WAR HORSE fails to convince all cinema aficionados that he is back on his auteurish path, only a merchandise vendor in the business.",War Horse
33,sddavis63,A Spectacular Finish Makes A Somewhat Disappointing Movie Worthwhile,6,22 February 2012,"I have to concede that after close to two hours of what I thought was at best a mediocre movie the last half hour of ""War Horse"" turns into one of the most effective tug at your heart strings tear-jerkers that I've ever come across. For that reason alone I have to give it credit, because it left me with a good feeling, even though in general I was rather disappointed with the movie as a whole.My recurring thought during the whole thing was that this was Anna Sewell's ""Black Beauty"" translated into a wartime setting. (One assumes that Michael Morpurgo - who wrote the novel upon which this is based - must have been influenced by Sewell's earlier novel which most people have probably read as children.) Think about it. It basically follows the life of a horse from its birth through to its eventual reunion with the young man who raised it. Along the way, we follow the horse from owner to owner and adventure to adventure. It's ""Black Beauty"" - albeit with a much darker story, being set as it is with mostly the carnage of World War I as its backdrop.We watch Joey (the horse) as a newborn frolicking with its mother, and then as he develops a bond of loyalty and affection with Albert (Jeremy Irvine), the son of the man who bought him at auction. This takes up probably close to an hour of the movie. It's somewhat slow going and could probably have been cut fairly liberally without sacrificing much of the story. Facing the loss of his farm, Albert's father (Peter Mullan) has to sell Joey off to a young British officer about to go overseas to France in the opening days of the War. Joey's life as a war horse is hard. The officer who purchased him is killed, and Joey gets taken by the Germans, and then finally ends up in the care of a young French girl. Then, back to the Gemans to haul artillery before Joey finally escapes after a British tank attack, only to find himself in no man's land, getting hopelessly entangled in barbed wire as he obviously waits to die. There was nothing much here that really captured my attention until this point, although you get at least a hint of what life in the trenches (and military life in general) was like during the Great War.One of the more dramatic scenes of the movie revolves around Joey's rescue. A British soldier, hearing the horse in obvious pain, races out of the trench to try to save him. Unable to get the barbed wire off, he's joined by a German soldier who has wire cutters and working together they free Joey. This was an amazing scene - reminiscent of the famous soccer match that erupted between British and German soldiers during a Christmas Day truce. As the two soldiers from opposing sides work to free the horse, they talk, and they discover that they really aren't all that much different. If there was anything I liked about the whole tenor of the movie it was that it didn't fall into the trap of taking sides in the War. Both the Germans and the British were people - and there were good people on both sides.Joey's rescue from the barbed wire leads him back to the British lines, and that incredibly emotional last part, as Albert (who by this time has enlisted - partly, one assumes, in the hopes of finding his horse) and Joey are reunited, but still have to overcome a few obstacles to stay together. The end of the movie is brilliantly played by the actors, brilliantly written by Lee Hall and Richard Curtis and brilliantly filmed by director Steven Spielberg. Finally back in England, with a dark orange sky as the incredibly effective backdrop, Albert and Joey return to the family farm, and Albert and his father - who had never really understood each other, partly because Albert's father had been a veteran of the Boer War and had experienced the horrors of war that Albert could never understand - suddenly come together, not merely as father and son, but as men with a shared experience.That incredible last half hour doesn't overcome all of the problems of pacing and story that were quite evident in the first two hours, and, yes, it is quite frankly too much of a military rip-off of ""Black Beauty."" But that incredible last half hour (which I have to confess brought a couple of tears to my eyes) does make you feel that this was worth watching! (6/10)",War Horse
34,Hellmant,"Classic Spielberg: nostalgic, epic and touching!",8,21 February 2012,"'WAR HORSE': Four Stars (Out of Five) Steven Spielberg directed this sentimental World War I drama about a horse's journey sold in to the cavalry. The film stars Jeremy Irvine, Peter Mullan and Emily Watson and was written by Lee Hall and Richard Curtis (based on the novel by Michael Morpurgo). It was nominated for six Academy Awards including best picture. The movie is classic Spielberg: nostalgic, epic and touching. Probably not worthy of best picture nomination status but a pretty well done film all the same.The film follows a thoroughbred foal from it's birth in Devon, England through it's passing of several different hands throughout World War I. It's most affectionately admired by a young boy named Albert Narracott (Irvine) who witnesses it being born. When his father Ted (Mullan) purchases it at an auction and brings it home Albert is thrilled but his mother Rose (Watson) is not, due to the fact that the horse is near worthless to the family and the work that needs to be done on their farm. Albert gives it his best to train it to be a good plough horse and his love for it grows even further as his efforts are somewhat successful. So his heart is torn even more when Ted sells the horse to a cavalry officer, in order to make overdue rent, as World War I begins. We watch as the horse then has several different adventures throughout the war.The movie has been criticized for it's over sentimentality but for me the film still worked. It is extremely slow paced but comforting at the same time. I found it very moving but even more so nostalgic with a somewhat classic feel in many ways. The film is heart breaking at times but also incredibly sweeping and grand throughout. If you're a fan of Spielberg or war films it definitely shouldn't disappoint. Not one of Spielberg's best (or the year's) but still a very good film.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V98a86sRto",War Horse
35,thesar-2,The Horse Wanderer,4,15 January 2012,"Maybe I don't have a heart as big as a horse's, but I think I have something else that is! Badum-ching! Anyways, I guess I just didn't have as much sympathy for this War Horse (4/10 Stars) as some might.For one, as grand and as beautiful as the movie was shot, thanks, Mr. Spielberg!, I never connected with Mr. Ed. Everyone kept calling him ""a miracle horse"" and I was given virtually no evidence of that. He just kept aimlessly wandering through a war-torn Europe while meeting several individuals who saw something in him that the director failed to show me. Thanks, Mr. Spielberg!I take that back, he did some supernatural things: he managed to make a joke when being trained to jump, he taught his hottie horsefriend what the humans were trying to do when they wanted to put a harness on her and when said lover was being recruited to haul a weapon of minimal destruction, Mr. Ed decided to step in and take the position while having some horsey sense on what the humans were trying to accomplish.Other than that, he was just a horse. Nothing special. I guess we just have to take what his human counterparts said for truth: he's something special.I was trained in journalism: Show, don't tell. Sadly, they didn't show me hardly anything to grasp on. They just told a very long story of point A: boy's beloved pet being sold and his coincidental journey home during WWI.Heck, here's more words, verses them showing me anything: in the finale (Sorry, Spoiler Alert!) the horse is getting ready to be shot because he's injured. And after a (not really, but again, they told us it's a) dramatic save from the boy's original master, immediately, his wounds will be treated ""like the soldier he is."" Whatthehell? What did this horse actually do, or the boy, for that matter, for Mr. Ed to receive special treatment?Speaking of that climax, I did have a little fun. In the final act, the horse has roughly 15-16 moments where I wanted to scream the clichéd slo-mo and cartoonish ""NOOOOO!"" when he might be kept from his master. It was hilarious after awhile. I mean, Mr. Spielberg treated the horse like his other World War epic's hero: Oskar Schindler from Schindler's List. You tell me who's the real hero, Jew-saving Oskar or Mr. Ed, without laughing out loud.I'll say it again, the scenery was crisp and beautiful – no shaking away a Best Cinematography Nod, the score was gorgeous and the acting was adequate. But the story was all over the place and I had to stop a few times to wonder what this movie was really about. It finally just boiled down to, like I said: the horse's journey from Point A to Point B and a million backdrops, a lot that were hilariously corny – such as the ""enemy"" that wanted to help SuperHorse and threw a dozen wire cutters to aid in the freedom of the boring horse.Oh, and when did everyone in Europe speak English? I'm sure Germans would've preferred their native tongueah, never mind, this was a toned down War movie. SEE: when deserters get punished, it's hidden from our eyes. Lame.",War Horse
36,cherold,"Powerful movie about the destructiveness of war, with Spielbergian gloss",9,25 February 2017,"In the beginning, War Horse looks like a rather standard boy-and-his-pet movie, as a young man takes charge of and falls in love with a horse. This takes place in lovely farmland with picturesque people. It's good, especially Emily Watson as the mom, but it's not ultimately what the movie is.When the horse is sold to a soldier at the beginning of world war I, it becomes clear that this is a movie not about a boy's love for his horse but about the ways in which war destroys everything it touches. This is not a war between good and evil, but instead a war between human beings who have been born in one country or another. No one even seems to understand what the fight is about; they just fight because they are told to.The horse, Joey, finds himself on both sides of the conflict, and his story becomes the tale of the people whose lives briefly intersect with his. It is a way to tell a story in breadth, although for some the approach is too episodic.As of now, this is the last time Spielberg really showed off his visual flair. At first, the movie is just scenic, but as it moves into war, there are stunning sequences, like soldiers riding through a wheat field or a terrible act synchronized to the turn of a windmill blade, that remind you of Spielberg's films of the previous century.Well worth watching.",War Horse
37,Robert_duder,A visual spectacle and a beautiful story,10,18 February 2012,"What a great year...we got to end 2011 with not one but two terrific films but the master himself Mr. Steven Spielberg. The first...animated but no less brilliant (Adventures of Tin Tin) and this terrific, beautiful, and heartwarming story, Warhorse. A film should not be judged by style alone and I don't judge this film just by style but it is a stunningly beautiful film. Some of the natural scenery, the grittiness of war without being gory or twisted, and just the entire setting of the film will draw you in and make you feel that you are there in this time, with this family, or that family, but always following the incredible journey of this powerful and brave Horse. The film makers including Spielberg hold back nothing in developing each character and each step of this horses journey. You will fall in love with so many of the characters and the war scenes will literally leave you on the edge of your seat. It is heart wrenching, beautiful, and just a really uplifting story. When the dust has settled from parts that will leave you breathless it doesn't fail to make you smile.Jeremy Irvine is perfect as Albert. His character reminds me of the good old Disney heroes from the great live action days like Old Yeller and the like and that is a compliment. He's fun and emotional and just really easy to draw yourself too. Most importantly he loves his horse. His parents are played by Peter Mullan and Emily Watson and they are both truly outstanding. Niels Arestrup and Celine Buckens plays Grandfather and Granddaughter who become Joey's (the horse) caretakers. They are both excellent in their role and you quickly become attached to their characters. Buckens gives a really great performance as a sick young girl whose Grandfather cares for her more than anything else in the world. I wish I could mention every character and actor in the film because they all have great performances although sometimes very brief. But the brilliance of the film is that no matter how small the role you will really appreciate every character and the part they play in the journey.You can't say much about Steven Spielberg's work. The man is a genius and a master of his craft. There is no doubt he knows exactly the right shots and style and cinematography. If you watched the whole film on silent you'd be stunned at the scenery. From a depression era farmhouse to both sides of the world war one battlefield and back again the journey is something to behold. This horse, the focus of the film, will take you through such a gambit of emotions and you will lose hope and have it all rush back all at once. This is simply a beautiful film and certain to be an instant classic. 10/10",War Horse
38,Lejink,Go on my son,8,6 December 2014,"It would be very easy to knock this big-budget Spielberg feature as fantastical, in terms of the succession of coincidences in its narrative and, of course, sentimentality in the director's time-honoured heart-wringing fashion, but it would be hard to imagine anyone with a love of animals, never mind horses, not being affected by this sweeping drama depicting the life of a young horse and its interaction with its various owners throughout its remarkable life.Thus, after some beautiful scene-setting photography of a golden-hued pre-First World War English countryside, we see the birth of a young foal, witnessed on a farm by the young son of its later first owner, a taciturn but determined tenant farmer, who we later discover is a Boer War veteran with a distinguished war record he refuses to discuss with anyone. The colt grows up under the tutelage of the young son and from an early age shows spirit and courage, forming what will be a lifelong bond with its first master.From there, circumstances, particularly the onset of the Great War, see it fall into the fleeting ownership of, by turns, an understanding young Army officer, two young German brother conscripts, an elderly occupied Dutch farmer and his orphaned grand-daughter, a caring horse-minder in the German army before, in the type of random coincidence it seems only Spielberg can get away with, the horse's story comes magically full circle in an emotionally charged climax on Armistice Day in 1918.All the various episodes in the horse's life emphasise the beauty, intelligence and character of the beast as it interacts with its owners. Some of the scenes of the privations the war-horse endures are heart-rendingly real-seeming (sending my upset wife out of the room at one point) especially after its big bid for freedom at the height of the fighting on a hellish battlefield sees it excruciatingly tangled in barbed wire and apparently doomed to die in agony, but somehow circumstances conspire to keep Joey and the story alive.With a succession of carefully and authentically staged big scenes, Spielberg engages the emotions of the viewer throughout. The carnage and futility of the war in the trenches is effectively depicted and if, the human characters seem almost clichéd and the story too unreal to be true at almost every turn, I'd say to anyone viewing it to just suspend disbelief, remember ""Lassie Come Home"" and have a handkerchief or three ready at your side.You will certainly need them.",War Horse
39,MLDinTN,"if an animal is involved, I love it",7,15 December 2012,"This movie is above average, but there are some things that hold it back. Namely, the story takes place during World War I and it is shot almost Disney like. It was a lot more brutal than shown. The other part I didn't like was having the German soldiers speak English. There should have been subtitles. The commander would yell in German, then everyone would speak English.But after overlooking all that, the movie is a touching story about a horse, Joey, surviving against all odds to be reunited with his master. The horse is captured several times, at times driven to the brink of death, and even finds a home with a young girl. And then he gets tangled in barb wire, which was awful to watch. But, like I said in the beginning, it's given a Disney ending.FINAL VERDICT: Good story, very scenic, and the horse comes out on top.",War Horse
40,g-bodyl,Vintage Spielberg!,10,11 June 2013,"War Horse is really powerful film that is Steven Spielberg at his best and it shows how extraordinary he is as an director. Even though this film takes place during World War One and there are some battle scenes, this is not a war film. This film is about the relationship between a boy and a horse. This film reminds me of Spielberg's Schindler's List because both movies focus on the people(or animals) who survived, not the millions who died.This film, based of the award-winning play and best-selling novel, is about how Mr. Narracott drunkingly buys a horse named Joey to plow their field and how the son, Albert falls in love with it. But once the Great War starts, Joey is needed for the military and over the course of the war, Joey and Albert goes against odds to find each other.This film features some fine British actors who did fantastic such as David Thewlis, Emily Watson, Tom Hiddleston, and rising star Benedict Cumberbatch. But, I must single out Jeremy Irvine because this is first major film and he hit all the sweet spots as the guy who loves his horse dearly.Overall, this is another excellent film by Spielberg. It features excellent, vast cinematography and a sweeping, rousing score by John Williams. This film will play with your emotions especially in those final minutes of the movie. Whilst not a war film, there are some pretty hefty war scenes. I did like a scene where a German and a British soldier come together to help Joey when he needed it. This is my pick that should have won Best Picture at the Oscars. I rate this film 10/10.",War Horse

42,lesleyharris30,"A Visual Delight, albeit Light on Character Arch,",7,8 May 2016,"War Horse is a good movie with a reasonably well developed storyline and a talented cast. The film is very stunning, a spectacle for your eyes, Steven Spielberg really did not hold back, it's very light on CGI, putting in as much psychical, real set pieces as possible, making it look beautiful because of how life-like it all is. However, it was really lacking in character development, we learn very little about these people before the adventure begins, there is basic points about them revealed, of course, but it never gets in depth enough, making us lack compassion for anyone other than the horse. It was also not as exciting as it could have been, the 12A rating being the issue, it holds back on conveying the real struggles of this war in order to remain kid friendly, if it had merely raised up to 15A it could have been very thrilling, delivering its potential more. It may have its flaws, but War Horse is a stunning two and a half hours, with a beautiful, sweet relationship between a man and his horse, do not go out of your way to see it, but it is worth the watch if you are looking for a good drama or war film.

45,vincentlynch-moonoi,Truly remarkable film,9,27 January 2012,"First a word about my ratings. I only give a ""10"" to one film -- ""Gone With The Wind"" -- in part for the scope of its story, the acting, and its technical aspects, which were way ahead of their time in 1939. I only give ""9""s to a handful of films, such as ""Ben-Hur"" and ""Dr. Zhivago"". And now, I give a ""9"" to ""War Horse"". I do understand why some would give it a significantly lower ratings. It has no ""movie star""...and even today, power movie stars are what most often lure movie-goers into theaters.I went to this film expecting to enjoy it, because it's rare that I don't enjoy a Steven Spielberg film. But I didn't expect to come out of the film raving about...or with tears in my eyes even after getting in my car. For the most part, people won't recognize most of the actors in this film. Some will know David Thewlis, and I enjoyed seeing David Kross (who was so good in ""The Reader""). But this is a film about superb acting, not famous actors. The photography and special effects were superb.Some complain that the plot is not logical -- that a boy raises a horse, which is then sent into World War I, the horse survives a number of brutal battles and dragging huge cannon through deep mud, and then, even after being temporarily blinded by a gas attack, the boy (now a soldier) finds his horse and saves its life. Okay, that's not realistic. But frankly, most films aren't very real. Real stories aren't interesting. This is fiction...but it's a great story!

46,tabuno,Uneven Performance,7,18 January 2019,"2 January 2012. This family oriented, feel bad and good movie in the spirit of Spielberg presented in mixed, uneven tone. Beginning in a rather comedic, light-hearted fashion, the movie descended into a more Saving Private Ryan (1998) mood even as it retained oddly its G-rated violence factor until midway through the movie and then more authentically reverted to a PG-13 violence depiction even though at least two earlier scenes were emotionally stunted by the overt exclusion of the more darker scenes of violence. The movie editing was also mixed in that important several character developments and plot lines were omitted leaving the audience to jump in time with important gaps in the storyline. Even the dramatic high point in the movie seemed counter-intuitive from how the War Horse was trained and the feel-good nature towards the end seemed to be less than consistent in tone with the absence of an important female character. The glossy, immersive experience occurred at various times that also didn't seem consistent throughout the movie and the black and white characters seemed to be somewhat at odds with the more seemingly balanced characters found in such movies as Secretariat (2010).",War Horse
47,paulclaassen,Another great Spielberg war movie.,6,6 June 2018,"Nominated for 70 awards (including 6 Oscar nominations) this is a masterpiece. 'War Horse' is an amazing story of loyalty and friendship - between man and horse, and between horse and horse. The cinematography and photography is fantastic. It was engaging to see how the horse got passed on from one person to the next, and how they fell in love with him, and the effect he had on them. Steven Spielberg has a reputation for directing child stars, but I must admit newbie Celine Buckens, who played Emilie, was really bad and unconvincing. Fair enough, it was her first role, but still. I also found it annoying for the Germans to speak English with German accents. They should have spoken German, with English subtitles. I understand Spielberg wanted to make an all-English language film, but this rendered a lot of scenes unconvincing.Spielberg's war scenes are incredible and disturbing. A particular scene of the horse getting tangled in barb wire was especially disturbing. Then there was a fantastic scene where the enemy came together to save a horse. Truly inspiring. The film does get a bit sentimental at times, but in general this was really awesome!",War Horse
48,zkonedog,If Forrest Gump Were A Horse,8,10 March 2017,"If you've ever seen the movie ""Forrest Gump"", you are familiar with the concept of ""the journey"" being more than ""the resolution"" in film-making. Steven Spielberg's ""War Horse"" is based on a similar concept...only instead of a bench-sitting, story-telling Southerner, this time the journeyer is of the equestrian variety.For a basic plot summary, ""War Horse"" is a conglomeration of tales surrounding a rather remarkable horse. Raised by a young boy as a plow horse in an Irish farm, the horse eventually finds itself in the thick of World War I, where it changes hands on a number of occasions, building drama along the way.At its core, ""War Horse"" is two things:First, it is a World War I period piece, which it succeeds at just fine. The battle scenes are intense, the time period looks/feels about right, and the impact of the war on the surrounding territories is a nice addition that usually isn't covered in these sorts of flicks.Primarily, though, ""War Horse"" is a human-centered drama that tells its story through the travels of the horse. Every person who comes into contact with the horse has an interesting backstory of their own, and Spielberg does a good job of fleshing them all out and still keeping them relevant in the end.The only reason this isn't a five-star film is because some of the situations the horse encounters fall (at least in my opinion) widely beyond the realm of possibility (in favor of high drama, of course).Overall, ""War Horse"" is a solid film that will attract a wide variety of audiences. Whether you prefer action/adventure, romance, human drama, animal tales, or war stories, this movie has something you will enjoy. The film can also be enjoyed by all but the youngest of children (as the war scenes are not too graphic as to scare off grade-schoolers).",War Horse

Contrary to many people, I think this movie is not just the story of a horse nor is it focused for people who are fond of horses. It spite of that, it uses the story of a particular horse to focus on a subject we rarely think about: the horse's indispensable help to humans. The horse was essential to our society over the centuries, both at peace and at war. He has been man's best friend, much more useful and important than the dog itself, and the film shows this very well, just like the affective bond that can be built between man and animal. I also liked the way the trenches and the war scenario was rebuilt. Everything seemed quite realistic and according to the historical truth, so I was able to ignore any hypothetical inaccuracies in the details. Jeremy Irvine did very well on the main human character, perfectly up to the challenge, as well as most of the supporting cast.

50,leplatypus,"They shoot horses, don't they (tv)",4,5 January 2013,"Well, it's what I expected it to be, ie, a minor opus from the maestro. Yet, it begins well: with a spectacular British landscape and a gripping look upon a hardworking rural family, it was like Spielberg was doing Tolkien. I was thus amazed of how the greatest director alive was going back to roots, to soil. Then, the war comes and we leave this shire to face horror and desolation through the lives of all protagonists: the British, the french, the Germans, either civilians or soldiers. The link between each sequence comes from the horse, which is tied to the different master the fate sends it. Thus, if the story is great and totally fitted for Spielberg (a hopeful tale set in war, the bravery of the common man), I was nor mesmerized nor moved as his previous movies. I don't really think that it was the horse factor because the animal offers great imagery: his run wilds, his mirroring eyes. For me, the problem comes from Williams' score which fails to give a strong theme for the horse (yet so vital as it doesn't speak) and a poor casting because all the little roles remain like this: no one transcend the few minutes allowed to bring massive emotion. I must add that I'm also a bit tired to see Spielberg doing war movies and I'm sure a lot of the magic is lost by the fact that everyone speaks English, no matter the nationality.So, it's a bit long and a bit dull. Sadly, the ending is the same vein: beautifully shot with sunlight, I really don't understand why the horse can't rejoice with the family",War Horse
51,howard.schumann,Symbolic of the purity and innocence we have lost,9,31 December 2011,"The old Lie; Dulce et Decorum est Pro patria mori."" (It is sweet and right to die for your country) - Wilfred OwenIn Steven Spielberg's War Horse, you will not find sexual addictions, murderous cults, criminal sociopaths, not even a single vampire. You will, however, find a compelling story of one boy's incredible bonding with a high-spirited half-thoroughbred who becomes trapped in the nightmare of the First World War. Based on the 1982 children's novel by Michael Morpurgo and the 2007 stage play by Nick Stafford and adapted for the screen by Lee Hall and Richard Curtis, War Horse features the acting debut of Jeremy Irvine as Albert Narracott, a sensitive youth from Devonshire, England who raises and trains the horse he names Joey and, even after they are separated, never gives up hope that they will one day be reunited. . Superbly shot by cinematographer, Janusz Kaminski, the film opens on a farm in Devon, England. Albert (Irvine) is a farm boy whose father Ted (Peter Mullan), a heavy drinker, buys an Irish horse at an auction as a message to his landlord (David Thewlis) who is also bidding. The horse is described as ""miraculous"" because of his speed, stamina, and physical beauty. The price, however, is steep, and unless the horse can plow the rocky fields, the family will lose the horse as well as all of their property to the avaricious landlord. No one including his father and mother Rose (Emily Watson) believe that it can be done, but Albert perseveres through sheer determination and an uncanny ability to communicate with Joey. In 1914, however, when Britain declares war on Germany, his father is forced to sell Joey to the British cavalry. A broken hearted Albert vows to enlist when he is of age to find Joey and bring him home. Sent to France, Joey passes through several hands including the kindhearted English Captain Nicholls (Tom Hiddleston) who vows to look after the horse. However, in a scene of extraordinary power, hard charging British soldiers attack a German camp, thinking they will overcome them easily with a surprise raid, but are met with heavy resistance from German cannons and hundreds of men are killed including Captain Nicholls.After a brief stint pulling an ambulance, Joey connects with a black stallion named Topthorn. Both find a small degree of comfort in the home of young Emilie (Celine Buckens) and her grandfather (Niels Arestrup) but it is short lived. Emilie is captured while riding Joey and he and the stallion are taken away by German soldiers. In another powerful sequence, when Joey is speeding away from a danger zone, he is cornered by a German tank but makes his escape by leaping over the tank. Sadly, however, he is caught in a barbed wire fence between the British and German trenches and becomes hopelessly entangled until a German with a wire cutter comes forward to help a British soldier free the suffering horse. Underlined by the soaring tones of John Williams score, War Horse can at times be saccharine, manipulative, and predictable, yet it is ultimately irresistible and a film that connects us to our essential humanity, evoking a simpler time when values were more important than box office and where entire families could watch a film together. Like the donkey in Bresson's ""Au hazard Balthazar"", the fictional horse stands as a symbol for the purity and innocence we have lost, and serves to remind us that real horses have been brutalized in wars throughout history from Alexander the Great to the 20th century, and continue to suffer today from those who profit from their sacrifice.",War Horse
52,Turfseer,"Spielberg's impressive World War I anti-war canvas, could have been a half hour shorter",7,3 January 2012,"As with most Spielberg films, the eye catching visuals, usually outweigh the dramatics. That includes 'War Horse', originally a short children's novel, later turned into a superb stage play involving life-sized puppets. 'War Horse' is full of masterful visual scenes that are up there with some of the classic scenes in cinematic history.The two scenes that really stick in my mind are the cavalry charge and Joey's solo run through the battlefield. It's a real twist when Spielberg has the British instead of the Germans as the aggressors, leading a cavalry charge on seemingly unsuspecting German troops. What Spielberg suggests here is that in the 'pointless' war that was World War I, even the 'good guys' could be just as 'bad' as the 'bad guys'. Not only do the British come off as bloodthirsty but also incompetent, as obviously they have been provided with faulty intelligence and end up roundly defeated when they and their horses run into a nest of German machine gunners. As the camera pulls back, the full horror of the war is depicted not in shots of bloody soldiers but in the massacre of gentle cavalry horses.The horror of the war becomes even more 'up close and personal', when Spielberg focuses on the fate of Joey, the horse raised in the English countryside by Albert Narracott, the young teenage protagonist, who later loses his beloved steed to the Army, after his father is forced to sell the graceful animal, to save the family farm. With minimal CGI effects, we follow Joey as he runs riderless on the battlefield, dodging countless explosions from both artillery and sniper fire. When Joey ends up tangled in barbed wire, man's inhumanity to man is illustrated through the suffering of an innocent equine. But Spielberg also believes in a message of hope, for Joey is soon to be extricated from his wiry imprisonment, by a German and British soldier, who come out of their trenches, after a momentary truce is declared.It would be impossible to evaluate 'War Horse' without also referring to the stage play which the film is primarily based on. In the stage play, Joey's father, Ted, is pitted against his own brother and their conflict feels much more elemental, than the toothless rivalry between the father and his landlord, as depicted in the film. The film's screenwriters also failed to utilize an assortment of local gentry, characters in the community which add to the verisimilitude of an English village on the eve of World War I. I also recall that the stage play had some wonderful songs sung by the colorful locals—there were a couple of particularly moving musical scenes, when the men go off to war and especially when Albert returns with Joey, after the Armistice is declared.Spielberg's other mistake is to hit us over the head with his anti-war theme. The brilliant and detailed battle scenes are not enough for Spielberg; he's got to throw in two unnecessary subplots to drive his point home further. Those include the two young German deserters who meet an untimely end by way of firing squad and a French grandfather and sickly daughter, who briefly hide Joey and another war horse, Topthorn, from German soldiers, who eventually discover them and haul them off for further unwelcome battle service.Spielberg wisely duplicates the dramatic and emotional reunion between Albert and Joey found in the novel and stage play. In the play, Albert makes a triumphant return with Joey to his village and is celebrated in song by his community. In the film, however, there's the unnecessary diversion of the French grandfather purchasing Joey, before changing his mind and giving Joey back to Albert. Some may find that the grandfather's act of great generosity is an effective wrap up for 'War Horse', but for me, the true climax occurs when Albert finds Joey and prevents him from being put down.Finally, Albert's reunion with his father in the film, is not as moving or dramatic as what happens on stage. Unfortunately, 'Ted' is such a morose character in the film, that we hardly can care when he bonds with his son at film's end. Likewise, Jeremy Irvine, doesn't quite have the gravitas to pull off the role of Albert as Seth Numrich did, in the Broadway production at the Vivian Beaumont Theater in New York.'War Horse' is about one half hour too long. But this is Spielberg, and who's going to tell the ""maestro"", that his fine film needs a little bit of judicious editing? Nonetheless, 'War Horse' is still an impressive achievement especially in regards to some brilliant cinematography and staging of battle scenes, which relied little on artificial, computer generated special effects.",War Horse

Yet that is exactly what this motion picture has done. Directed by none other than Steven Spielberg, this film tells the story of an extraordinary Horse called 'Joey' which is born on an Irish Farm and raised by Albert Narracott (Jeremy Irvine). Despite the need of a work horse for the struggling farm, his father Ted Narracott (Peter Mullan) nevertheless goes head over-heels in debt to purchase a Throughbread. Struggling to stay ahead of the landlord (David Thewlis) the family does it's level best to stay out of debt. However, times are what they are and eventually Joey is soon purchased by the army and travels across the sea where he participates in the human slaughter called World War I. Trading hands several times, Tony encounters English owners, German soldiers as well as French civilians only to find himself wallowing in trench warfare and rolls of barbed wire.

54,freemantle_uk,My Lovely Horse,8,25 January 2012,"World War II has been put to film a number of times in many different countries, but there are not nearly enough World War I films. Steven Spielberg set out to redress the balance giving us War Horse, an adaptation of a children's book and the play of the same name.Albert Narracott (Jeremy Irvine) is a young man living in Dartmoor in 1914. His father (Peter Mullan) buys a thoroughbred horse when he should have plough because of his rift with his landlord (David Thewlis). Albert is able to break in the horse who he names Joey and he shows to be a very special horse, strong, determined, loyal and intelligence. But when World War I breaks out, Joey is sold to a British office, Captain Nicholls (Tom Hiddleston) and during the course of the conflict the horse see all aspects, from a Calvary horse, in rural civilian life for a French girl suffering Hollywood's disease (i.e. they say she is dying but seems perfectly healthy), as a German work horse and in no man's land.Spielberg has a good track record making historical films with Schindler's List, Saving Private Ryan and Empire of the Sun. War Horse is a solid film rather then being a great film. It is a film that is rich in period detail, showing the brutal nature of World War I, from the effects of chemical warfare and you feel the muddy, dirty environment as horses pull a giant artillery battery up a hill and Spielberg knows how to make a mundane scene of a horse ploughing a field exciting and emotional (it must be the most boring village in the world for watching a horse ploughing to be considered entertainment). But at the same time there are also some problems, particularly Spielberg's reliance on cutesy humour, from a goose who chases people to a scene in the trenches. I would not be surprise if Richard Curtis was partially responsible. The film is too long and many scenes could have been shorten or cut, particularly in the beginning. I think the relationship and love between Albert and Joey could have easily have been done in half the time.It was a great idea of using a horse to show the horrors of war and the different perspectives of war. It is a great opportunity to show that they are good guys and bad guys on both sides of the war. There is some success in that in the German army privates are show to be decent caring people to the horse, but the officer core and sergeants were very harsh and cruel. Compare it to the British officers who are noble, if a little arrogant or cocky, but there are hints in one of the officers that behind his eagerness that in reality he was scared of the prospect of going to war for the first time. I would have wanted to see more of a mixed picture within all sides of the war and try to give more depth to the characters.There is a great cast in War Horse, we have emerging talent like Hiddleston and Benedict Cumberbatch who in their small roles show they are going to be big actors (well more so), new talent like Irvine who was excellent, playing his character like Sam and Frodo from Lord of the Rings and Celine Buckens where the humour works best. Emily Watson was also brilliant as Albert's mother and it great to see in a big film. And of course Joey the horse shows a lot of promise as an animal performer.John Williams also supplies Mr. Spielberg with another great score, fitting for the film and Janusz Kaminski continues with great camera work, from the bright work of Devon in the summer to more grey and dull view of the front line of the war.War Horse is a solid piece of filmmaking. It is typical Oscar bait but it still works as a film and Spielberg is able to make us care for Joey.7.5/10.",War Horse

If you're a fifteen - year - old who enjoys mucking - out stables you may find this on - off romance between boy and horse entertaining,but for those built of sterner stuff boredom sets in before Joey sets hoof on the continent. ""War horse"" starts in a never - never England with villages redolent of ""Greyfriars Bobby"" or,dare I say it,""Lassie"",whose style seems to have been an inspiration. Carrot - crunching extras with the requisite RADA ""country"" accent veering between Cornish and Norfolk and all stations in between attend an auction where Joey is bought by a drunken tenant farmer for whom it appears to be love at first sight.The initial passion seems to evaporate quite quickly when the farmer discovers what every other village idiot could have told him:Joey is not a plough horse.With shaking hands he is about to blow Joey's brains out(he couldn't have sold him?)when his son interposes his body twixt father and horse - thus beginning a lifelong romance. Taking to the plough as to the manner born,Joey saves the farmer from bankruptcy until a storm ruins the crops.In a splendid deus ex machina war is declared and with almost indecent haste the farmer sells Joey to the military,showing a marked lack of gratitude. Now I like horses as much as the next man,but by now I was all horseyed out,and Joey's odyssey across the wartorn plains of Europe became,frankly,a gallop too far. After some pretty trite ""all men are brothers"" stuff,""Warhorse"" finishes up with a Walt Disney sunset;All it required was for ""When you wish upon a star"" to come on the soundtrack and my cup would have runneth over.

56,PWNYCNY,Horses fought too.,10,17 January 2012,"I was expecting this movie to be just another extravagant sentimental potboiler. Wow, was I surprised. This is a great movie. The title says the movie is about a horse, but it's really about a lot more than that. The horse plays a central role but the humans figure in the story too, in a big way. The cinematography is outstanding; it really conveys the bleak, gory nature of war. The movie alludes to the Battle of the Somme which is one of the costliest battles in history in terms of the sheer number of lives lost. At times the movie does lapse into sentimentality but in general the story proceeds at a fast pace (pun intended). The performances of the horses in this movie are impressive. They are stars in their own right. If the movie accomplishes nothing else, it shows that war is hard on animals too, and like the humans, they are victims too; there was never a horse that wanted to go to war. That any horses survived at all in the war is amazing. Anyway, this movie is well worth watching.",War Horse
57,meeza,A horse of a movie!,9,5 February 2012,"Wanna horse around? I finally did when I giddied up and gave Steven Spielberg's ""War Horse"" a cinematic ride, and boy was it worth it. The latest Spielberg offering stars newcomer Jeremy Irvine as Albert Narracott, a British teenager in the early 1940's who is the proud owner of a horse named Joey whom he cherishes like life itself. Upon the start of World War II, Albert's father Ted is forced to sell the strong stallion to the English cavalry in order to save the farm, in more ways than one. Brokenhearted Albert eventually enlists in the war in order to find his Joey. Spielberg's maestro direction in depicting the bravery and perseverance of Joey as he rides through various adventures with different British, German, and French characters throughout World War II is yet another emotional gift Spielberg has brought us to love the movies; the legend has not lost his auteur touch. Richard Curtis and Lee Hall's moving ""War Horse"" script should have been moved into Academy Award's Best Adapted Screenplay nominee list. Even though it got snubbed there, I must say that ""War Horse"" did garner a few Oscar nominations including a well-deserved Best Picture nomination; even though it's not going to be a horse race this year with the heavily-favorite and brilliant ""The Artist"" expected to take the big Oscar prize. OK, time to get back on the ""War Horse"". Young Irvine did saddle up quite impressively with a nice performance as Albert. Other solid acting performances were turned out by Peter Mullan as Albert's dad Ted, Emily Watson as Albert's mom Rose, and Tom Hiddleston as a British noble serviceman Captain Nichols. Janusz Kaminski's cinematography was quite the picturesque vision. The legendary John Williams keeps scoring movie score points with yet another classic movie score to a Spielberg movie. ""War Horse"" is a brilliant film that requires for you to bring a horse of a handkerchief to wipe out the plethora of tears that will be rolling down from your eyes upon seeing the movie; and if you don't shed a tear, then you might want to see your doctor to check your heartbeat (even you, tough guys).

58,drqshadow-reviews,"Easy, Sentimental and Dull Through-and-Through",4,22 June 2015,"Essentially a Benji movie, starring a horse, set in the trenches of World War I. Horse is raised by a loving master, horse overcomes the odds to save the family farm, horse is sold into service, horse endures a magical journey through the pages of history. Deep down, there's clearly an emotional, colorful, ageless story just begging to be told, but not like this. Time and time again, director Steven Spielberg takes the easy route, opting to embrace the storybook-courageous, squishy human aspects of the animal itself, at the expense of his dry, boring, two-legged supporting cast. The spotlight shines for so long, so brightly upon the beast, that I half expected him to throw on a British uniform and bark out a dazzling rally cry to his fellow troops as the war draws to a close. Sentimental to a fault, tame and regurgitated and downright boring, it's a real strikeout for the normally-reliable Spielberg. Better versions of the same story have been told in half the time, with a fraction of the budget.",War Horse
59,GiraffeDoor,Looks great at least.,6,26 March 2019,"Your standard Spielberg blockbuster: spectacular to look at with an adequate script.Not subtle with its mournful approach to war, it can drive up passions if you let it but its quite overlong.But unforgivably, it's all in English! This movie should have at least three languages in it but the French and Germans speak English to each other! I HATE that!People like Morpurgo because he presents an agreeably flag waving vision of war, indicating its brutality in a way, padded enough for your children while still keeping it maudlin and not actually suggesting that war is something misguided.If you can get over how much this movie pats itself on the back for showing the universality of the war experience no matter what side (indeed species) you are, it's fun enough but maybe take a long bathroom break because it goes on a while without much variation.",War Horse
60,CubsandCulture,They found the right horse(s) and the right boy. Classic Spielberg,10,23 November 2019,"Spielberg can be sentimental and optimistic to a fault. Trying to provide a heart warming tale while using the Great War as a backdrop very well could have been one of those times. The film is often close to becoming cloyingly sentimental. Th ending especially can feel like Spielberg at his most forced Spielbergian if one is not in the right frame of mind. But if one takes this film in the earnest spirit it is intended it is a emotive coming of age tale that deftly handles its various threads.A lot of the work of buying into this film is because of Joey. The horse(s) that play him are really expressive and Spielberg, and his editor, coax engaging ""performances"" from them. The film is at its core a twin coming of age tale-of Joey and Albert-and it is impressive the amount of emotion the equine story contains. Now Irvine is also very good as Albert; he captures the sort of innocent earnestness this film requires. He just *looks* the part as well. The interplay between the boy and his horse is why this film exists and they nailed that dynamic.The film is decidedly and proudly old fashioned. The production values are top notch, with the cinematography being especially lovely. I appreciate that Spielberg knew how to have the impact of the war scenes without showing a lot of the violence directly. As a matter of tone he finds a nice balance between capturing the coming of age story and the horrors of war.This may be Spielberg's enjoyable film this century.",War Horse
61,estebangonzalez10,"10 Stars for the Horse, 6 for the Film",6,12 February 2012,"¨Separated by war. Tested by battle. Bound by friendship. ¨ War Horse might be about a miraculous and beautiful horse, but the movie has nothing miraculous about it. It's a well filmed movie, but the story and the performances are very melodramatic at times. The scenery is gorgeous, but the pacing is slow for a two and a half hour long movie. The Academy seemed to like this Steven Spielberg film more than I did since it received six Oscar nominations, including Best Picture, but despite the excellent performance from the horse (or should I say horses?) this won't be among my favorite films of the year. Of course it has the typical Spielberg narrative that has made him such a lovable director, but I felt it was way too melodramatic at times. War Horse is based on the novel written by Michael Morpurgo, while the screenplay was adapted by Lee Hall (Billy Elliot) and Richard Curtis (Notting Hill, Bridget Jones's Diary, and Love Actually). The main protagonist of the story is this beautiful horse (played in the most part by the same horse from Seabiscuit), but the rest of the cast in this film are far from memorable. The War scenes really didn't impact me at all in the way that Spielberg did in Saving Private Ryan, but I guess he couldn't go that far if he wanted to make a family film. It does have some strong scenes however that might be difficult to watch (like when the horse gets caught up in the barb wires). War Horse is a good movie, but far from memorable and one I wouldn't enjoy watching again.The story takes place during 1914 in a small English town named Devon where a young teen named Albert (Jeremy Irvine) is seen watching the birth of a foal. That foal grows up to be a beautiful strong horse and is taken to an auction to be sold. Devon's father, a farmer named Ted (Peter Mullan) is mesmerized by the animal and decides to buy it despite it not being a plough horse, but a thoroughbred. Devon is happy about his father's decision, although his mother, Rose (Emily Watson) is upset because Ted has spent more money than they can afford on an animal that won't help them in the far. To make matters worse, their landlord (David Thewlis) wants his rent money and demands after the harvest season or else he will take the land away from them. Devon tells his parents not to worry, that he will train the horse and teach it how to plough. Together Devon and the horse, which he names Joey, accomplish the impossible and plough the land in time for the harvest. However, a heavy rain ruins the harvest and everything is lost for Ted and his family. In order to pay the rent he is forced to sell the horse to a soldier, Captain Nicholls (Tom Hiddleston) since the country is at the brisk of war against Germany. That is how Joey begins his transition from one owner to the next, and from one band to another, after the English are defeated in a battle and the horse is taken by the Germans. Whoever his owner may be they will soon find out that he is no ordinary horse.The cast is perhaps one of the weakest links about this movie. I didn't find the performances very memorable and the drama seemed really forced at times. The best actor by far was the horse. Since the horse switches from one owner to another, there are several characters and different stories and some work better than others. The movie begins very slow, but once the war begins the story picks up at times. The final thirty minutes are really intense and do lift the movie, but it's too bad it takes so long to pick up. The beginning is really slow and melodramatic and I feared the worst for this film, but thankfully it does get much better and the ending saves the movie. Even the performance from Jeremy Irvine seems to pick up in the second half (I really hated it in the first part). Tom Hiddleston's role wasn't very attractive either, I didn't enjoy his performance, it seemed too forced. My favorite character in this movie was Emilie, a young girl that lived alone with her grandfather who finds the horse in a windmill. She was played by Celine Buckens and her role was hilarious. She has some funny lines, but as most characters she isn't in this movie for too long. The barbwire scene was also pretty memorable and I loved the way the scene was resolved in such a comedic matter. If only War could be avoided in the same way. In conclusion we learn a lot from this miraculous horse and how animals too suffer in middle of men's wars and differences. Too bad the pacing and the narrative was a little off, but the film is still worth a watch.http://estebueno10.blogspot.com",War Horse
62,juneebuggy,"Put off watching this for ages because you know, boy-horse-war =that can't end well but there was no need to be afraid",9,21 February 2015,"Yup this was super good. I'd put off watching it for ages because I just thought it was going to be too horrible, with a horse and a young man in the trenches of WW1. I mean you just know that's not going to end well. What I hadn't expected here was the lightheartedness, especially in the opening scenes in England with the cheeky young colt, a butt pinching goose and a very Disney-esque feel on the farm. In fact the whole movie has a very childlike quality to it despite the subject matter.I'm assuming this is because (to my surprise) War Horse is based on a children's book, you know one of those Scholastic ones you read at about age 10. The story is told from the horses (Joey's) point of view and follows his adventures from England through being sold into the Calvary and throughout the first World War. Touching on all the people he meets and inspires during his adventures.Interestingly you never see anyone actually getting killed here, you know it happens sure, in the background or with long shots but the carnage is never shown. There's even very little blood and only one scene I had a tough time with as Joey runs through No Mans Land, bombs exploding around him and gets tangled up in barbed wire. That was tough but resolved when a soldier from each side crosses over to help him, so yeah, nice.This was a really great movie, cinematography, sets, actors etc. All I can say is don't be afraid of it and Benedict Cumberbatch has a small role. 11/25/14",War Horse

The story is then predictably sentimental and melodramatic to appeal to its target juvenile audiences. This film was appropriately helmed by the acknowledged expert in directing films for young audiences, Steven Spielberg.""War Horse"" is about an elegant brown stallion named Joey by the teenage boy who raised him, Albert Naracott. When war broke out between Britain and Germany, Joey was sold by Albert's father to the army, as Albert tearfully promises they will see each other again one day. From there, we follow Joey's intense experiences, both bad and good, in and out of the line of battle. Will Joey and Albert ever be reunited in the end? I think you all know the answer to that.The photography is the best feature of this film as the camera captures the dramatic vistas in both peace and war times in the British countryside. Spielberg also reminds us of his proficiency with war scenes, as he had shown us before in films like ""Empire of the Sun,"" ""Schindler's List"" and ""Saving Private Ryan."" Joey has some spectacular scenes as he gallops through the battlefield and through the trenches. Spielberg really knows how to amaze us with technically fantastic shots, without losing the emotion and heart of the story.

65,peterp-450-298716,A horse called Rintintin,5,2 January 2014,"This is a pleasant family film in which every member of the family will find a piece they'll love most . The kids can dream about the adventurous part and the bond of friendship between a person and an animal . The women will be sobbing with all the sentimental and gooey stuff in this film while their handkerchief will get moister as the end nears . The tougher men of the family can set up for some authentic WWI footage.The look and feel of this movie took me back to movies like ""Old Yeller"". It looks sometimes like a painting. I had the feeling that it was not always filmed outside . The storyline is much like Forrest Gump , only that this time a horse is the subject that runs through history and all sorts of situations. A comparison with Lassie is obvious cause Joey behaves like a trained collie . At one moment i expected him to go sit on his butt like a real dog.The characters have a wide spectrum of feelings and personality . Joey is obviously highly intelligent an extremely loyal. Everyone would love to have such a horse hopping around in the garden. Not only does he express infinite love for Albert , but he's also that strong to plow an entire field full of stumps and boulders in one night. Albert is the lucky boy who's friends with this wonder horse . It is a simple , extremely boring and never aging man . For his age , I think he has an unhealthy interest in horses. instead of chasing girls and hang out with friends, he only talks and thinks about his horse. Like someone noticed on IMDb : "" I guess one day he would like to settle down with Joey the Horse , get married with Joey the Horse and have kids with Joey the Horse . His character is so utterly one dimensional and bland . "" . Peter Mullan I thought was brilliant again in his role as the hardworking farmer who bought Joey on an auction right under the nose of his landowner.I think Mullan is one hell of an actor since I've seen him in "" Tyrannosaur "". Emily Watson played convincingly the bossy wife and David Thewlis played an unkind version of a harsh landowner and I often hoped that he would be trampled under the feet of Joey .As mentioned earlier , the film shows the adventurous life of Joey . From the pasture where he was born , to the farm where he needs to work hard, into the British army who loses Joey in a failed attack and he falls in the hands of the Germans. Then he ends up with a French girl and her grandfather ( peak of dullness in the whole movie ) . Then again back in the hands of the Germans and eventually he gets tangled in barbed wire right in the middle of the battlefield . The end is so incredibly predictable with the obligatory moment when Albert and Joey meet again and return home to embrace his mother and eventually the father.Terribly corny and sentimental film material in a heap , but filmed in a masterful way . The symbolic nature of the film is not hard to guess . The beauty of a deep-rooted friendship in contrast with the horrible hateful war in the background . This WWI was realistically portrayed on screen even though it seemed like a fairly clean war here . No blood spattered around, not even a drop. No ripped bodies. No hideous looking casualties caused by the gas attacks . In reality it was not a pretty picture. But all in all I thought it was pretty entertaining to watch and not boring at all. Although the moment when Joey got entangled in barbed wire was too ridiculous for words. I rather think that they would have used him as a practice target. For me, the moment when five cutters flew through the air to make him loose was a humorous slapstick moment .Conclusion : A Walt Disney fairy tale with many war sentiment and heartbreaking melodramatic , but picturesquely portrayed. Not the best of Spielberg , but it certainly was not that bad and awful.More reviews at meningvanfilmfreak.blogspot.be",War Horse
66,AudioFileZ,The Bond Between Man and Beast,9,9 January 2012,"This holiday season I've seen two movies which couldn't be more different except they both portrayed the almost spiritual bond which often occurs between man and animals. I'm referring to Dolphin Tale and War Horse. Both manage to capture the best part of the human condition as related to being connected to animals with amazing abilities. I feel entertained and moved by both of these films.War Horse, unlike Dolphin Tale, isn't AFAIK based on any true story. It would be hard for it to as it demands a bit of suspension which allows it to work as a ""Old Yeller"" type of heart-warming movie. Trading a bit of believability isn't a problem as Spielberg has, in spite of showing the horrors of war, managed to deliver a very uplifting tale. Against every imaginable odd, a boy and his beloved horse survive all the horrors life's hardships and, even more dramatic, the slaughter of the first world war.Special nods must go to the cinematographer as this is one unbelievably beautifully photographed film. The European countrysides, the amazing charging battle scenes, and the ending sunset blazing sky scene reminds me of the Technicolor richness of ""Gone With the Wind"" and that's the highest compliment I can give. The actors who play Joey and Emily must be applauded for giving superlative performances. What's left is the horse itself which turns in such an amazing performance it makes me want to go out and buy a horse!!!If you love animals you must see this film. If you just want to experience a good story of humanity against the ghastliness of war go see it. Finally, if you just want to lose your worries for a couple of hours and be entertained go see this film. War Horse works on many levels and only real ""stick in the mud"" types will walk out without smiles. Bravo Mr. Spielberg!",War Horse
67,Samiam3,"Good, not Great",7,9 April 2012,"One problem that some film makers run into (especially successful ones) is that when they get too old, they don't try as hard. With War Horse, Steven Spielberg takes an epic war tale and plays it a little bit, well, safe.The horse, is certainly the star in this well shot, well edited, well composed motion picture. As a depiction of the great war, War Horse is a little bit, bloodless. The film gets too comfortable in the PG-13 zone, meaning that the battle scenes lack the bloodshed, drama, and the horror that helped define Spielberg's better films (namely Saving Private Ryan). Watching War Horse, you get the feeling that Spielberg is quite desperately trying to cut around the blood probably for the sake of a younger audience. This effect sort of dampens the dramatic potential here.The other problem with War Horse is that it begins and it ends from one lead characters point of view, but in between, it is very much an ensemble feature. We get to see the war in snap shots as this magnificent horse ends up in various different peoples hands (across three different armies). The amount of time we spend away from the principle character (slightly underplayed by Jeremy Irving), means that he never becomes fully formed to us. He has a beginning and an end, but no middle.So War Horse is a little weak as a story, but nevertheless, the movie does pull through. Spielberg, for better or worse, has a good sense of classic movie making, and while his style is ageing a bit, he is always a pleasure to watch. That's the best I can say for War Horse, without being a great. film, it is a pleasure to watch.",War Horse

The weaker among you will certainly cry.Apparently the British had not learned anything since the Crimean War, as they sent cavalry with swords against German machine guns. The results were predictable, and the horse changes hands.One of the most fascinating parts of the film was when Colin and Peter worked together to free the horse.

69,jadepietro,Horsing Around with Reality,7,17 December 2011,"This film is recommended.A no-so-perfect blending of Steven Spielberg's favorite subjects merge effectively into his latest epic adventure, War Horse. The film is a parable on life and death, a basic war movie, a children's tale and period story, a film about the unconditional love between a boy and his pet. His themes remain constant: courage against adversity, the bonds of friendship and family ties, nostalgic memories of the past, an innocent's childlike view of the world, a triumph of love conquering all.While I admired much of the technical artistry of the film, I was underwhelmed with the final results. War Horse still boasts a solid pedigree. First a beloved children's book about a boy and his horse, then a Tony-awarding drama with marvelous stagecraft and innovative puppetry substituting for the real equine creatures, and now a heart-warming movie for the whole family. And that's the main problem for me...War is not meant to be that pleasant a subject for all ages!Its plot is rather simple: Albert owns and loves his pet horse, Joey. His horse is sold to the cavalry during World War I and he decides to enlist in the army to bring Joey back home. The boy and the horse see the casualties of war on the front-line and their paths will eventually cross amid the death and destruction of those they encounter along the journey.War Horse is an extremely well made film that unabashedly manipulates its audience, getting those tear ducts to work overtime. Rather than showing an accurate no-holds-barred view of warfare,Spielberg chooses to coat his film with a schmaltzy thick syrup of saccharine goo, allowing his film to drip with excessive sentimentality when it should be more hard-edged and truthful.As in the book and play, absurd and ironic coincidences and chance meetings are laid on mighty thick. In this film adaptation, the interweaving of its characters and their ownership of the horse over the four year period of the war rambles on. Less time is spent building the relationship of the boy to his parents and their rocky marriage. The father is made far too likable and pathetic while the mum is strong and stoic. These stereotypes become living clichés. Their farmhouse, too rustic and studio-worn, seems ersatz. Other scenes that are added to the film tend to weigh down the initial story and do nothing to create a realistic view of those times and places. Overall, there is a generic reaction to the almost gentrified surroundings and the film's over-saturated use of unreal Technicolored red-orange skies and muddy earth tones don't help matters. War Horse sanitizes the brutality of war to keep its PG-13 rating. Lives are lost and so are many opportunities to confront the savageness of war. Blood is spilled, but nary one drop on the battlefield. Violence occurs, but is seen mostly off-camera. Bodies and carcasses are neatly composed reminders of the price of war, but the direct tragedy of their death is rarely shown. The end result seems strangely synthetic, coming from the same director of the powerful and brutally honest Saving Private Ryan, one of the greatest war films ever made.But this time, Spielberg's approach seems to be resistant to any hint of authenticity in his film. In fact, nothing seems real, especially the film's glorified depiction of World War I. The use of subtitles in French and German would have given the film a more realistic complexity, although having everyone speak English makes the film more profitable in its mass audience appeal. And perhaps, that is his ultimate aim: to make a crowd-pleasing uplifting fable for everyone to enjoy. And, on that issue, I take umbrage.However, there is one segment in the film where Spielberg uses his directorial skills to the fullest potential: Joey's encounter with a tank that leads to his wild gallop through the barbed wired fields of battle and into the trenches. In that portion, the photography, editing, and music are perfectly in sync with the story and its images of the horrors of war. In that moment, War Horse gallops bravely forward and does not shy away from war's cruelty, which it tends to do countless times throughout the film. It confronts the true savage face of combat head-on and shows what the film might have been if Spielberg would have reined in his temptation to heighten the melodramatics.Still, War Horse is first-class filmmaking. It vividly entertains its audience and its central story of the friendship between a boy and his pet still resonates to the child in us all. Both horse and boy ( newcomer Jeremy Irvine ) perform very well and completely hold your interest. The sound effects, picturesque scenery, and film editing are also particularly impressive, although John Williams' grandiose score becomes too intrusive and overwrought at times. Yet the film remains a bit of an enigma, a worthy but slightly disappointing effort, partly due to all of the major talent involved and my high level of anticipation. Just like the film's proud steed, the noble and stately War Horse takes its serious subject in its stride. Maybe a bit too much for its own good, and that of this moviegoer.

70,RatedVforVinny,Overtly Sentimental.,5,15 December 2018,"I think the highly accomplished stage play would have been much more dynamic than the movie spin-off. Directed by Oscar minded Steven Spielberg, 'War Horse' is drenched with tear-jerking sentimentality. Still the battle scenes are well handled and the opening cavalry charge was pretty exciting. The subject matter is of great interest to me but 'War Horse' takes the safe turn, in every direction and with no surprises. If ever there was a film made simply for the award ceremonies, well look no further than this.",War Horse
71,p-stepien,Verging on outdated cinema,5,13 June 2012,"During the First World War a young English boy called Albert (Jeremy Irvine) falls in love with a horse he names Joey, only for the horse to be taken away once his family falls into debt and is forced to sell off their most prized possession. The horse ultimately falls under the care of Captain Nicholls (Tom Hiddleston), who treats the animal with the ultimate respect he can afford. The war however holds no prisoners and the horse ends up in the hands of the Germans, after its new owner is killed in battle. Various turns of events have Joey go from person to person and be part of key events in their lives, both tragic and beautiful (but mostly the first).Spielberg punches back with a visual spectacle, where he endeavours to employ all his best tricks with a skillful mix of drama and humour. Nonetheless his end result is a movie of immense charm, but one that is capsized by the over-reliance on worn out clichés, which make ""War Horse"" painfully predictable and at times unwantonly funny or even bordering on ridiculous. The melodrama has too much corn on its cob and even though Spielberg manages to touch several emotional cords he ultimately fails to bestow credibility to an overdrawn drama.There are several captivating and well-worked scenes, while some shots are absolutely brilliant (e.g. death by firing squad in front of a decrepit windmill, which is both emotionally poignant and stunningly captured). Nonetheless by the time the spectacle draws to its close the false notes start to heavily burden the overall satisfaction level to cause feelings of dissatisfaction and ultimate disappointment.And why do all people in Spielberg movies speak English (German language is English language with a German accent, French is English with a French accent and so on)... I honestly think we're past that phase in filmmaking and postman is way past its expiration date.",War Horse
72,raulfaust,War Hope,8,18 May 2012,"A man buys a horse that seems to be useless for anything, and his son (Albert) makes friends with the horse, naming him Joey. The kid achieves to tame the strong horse into a speedy racer. After that, English army buys the horse from his dad, giving him no choice, so he had to go to war as well. War scenes are strong and you feel very sorry so many people are dying for nothing. Joey, the horse, survives after all the obstacles he had to face throughout the confrontations. Jeremy Irvine, thought with no experience, gives a great performance to thrill the spectator every time he says something about Joey. One beautiful scene is when soldiers from enemy countries help each other to let the poor horse go from the barbwire; it's a great scene to show that NOBODY wins with war, they only lose. Story is very entertaining and 146 minutes seems to pass in a matter of seconds-- going against many people that stated this is overlong. In the end, Joey and Albert come back home with life, and in a perfect photographed scene they hug their family celebrating they're alive after all-- which is the strongest scene in the entire picture, in my opinion. I have to confess I nearly cried in this scene, and it's not an usual thing for me. WATCH ""War Horse"" and you won't regret.",War Horse
73,rannynm,A Remarkable Film For Older Viewers,9,6 January 2012,"The acclaimed War Horse play and children's book is now on the big screen! War Horse is a heartwarming tale about a father who buys a horse for his son on a whim. His son, Albert played by Jeremy Irvine, develops an unbreakable bond his horse, Joey. However, World War I approaches, and Joey is drafted into the military. Will the two ever reunite?The movie has a charming story. When I interviewed the author of the children's book War Horse, Michael Morpurgo, he told me that his book shows how war does not only produce a severe effect on people, but with animals too, specifically horses. It is interesting watching director Steven Spielberg's translation of that theme onto film. One notable scene shows the horse, Joey, galloping fiercely through no man's land, but is forced to slow down after he is tangled in a bunch of wires. After intense war, both opposing sides come together to untangle the horse! I found it touching because it shows that it takes both sides to solve a problem, and when the movie shows both soldiers cutting the wires from the horse, I thought of it as a symbol like they were ending their conflicts between each other. The cinematographer, Janusz Kaminski, filmed the scene beautifully, which helped produce such an emotional effect on the audience.The cinematography in general is wonderful, especially when Kaminski zooms in the feet of the horses and the faces of the horses as they gallop across the vast fields. Most of the beauty of the movie comes from the horses, and I think the horse trainers did an impeccable job, particularly ZelieBullen since she trained the main horse, Joey. I recommend this movie to teens ages 13 and up. It is a pleasant family film because it is not too brutal, yet it still packs in all of the action and intensity of war. The movie is a bit slow in the beginning, so younger teens may get bored, but it quickly picks up the pace as the war begins. This is a moving tale to watch and will bring the entire family together for the holidays.Reviewed by Gabriella Chu, age 15, KIDS FIRST! Film Critic.

74,bob-rutzel-1,A Great Family Movie,10,14 April 2012,"Albert (Jeremy Irvine) trains a horse, names him Joey, loses him to the World War 1 effort in England, and vows to find Joey after the war. Joey ends up helping English and German soldiers and wins the respect and admiration of both sides. You are going to wish this was a true story. The horse is so smart you are reminded of Hidalgo in the true story by the same name and Bob the Horse in the Greening of Whitney Brown. You can see Joey's eyes surveying a situation and making a decision. You almost expect him to talk. I do not know if CGI was used within this but there were tons of horse trainers listed in the credits, and I could not get enough of this horse and maybe you will feel the same way too. There are two instances that will literally blow you away. A young farm girl, Emilie, (Celine Buckens) tries to get Joey to jump over a stick propped up by crates. Wait until you see how Joey handles that. The other instance is when Joey escapes from the Germans and is caught by barb wires and cannot move. He is between the German and English lines. Each side sees the horse in pain. What happens next will give you pause to believe there is hope for mankind after all. From time to time when Joey is passed between English and German soldiers you will be amazed at how much respect both sides had for the horses. Both sides constantly used the word Remarkable when talking about Joey. You wish there was no war and that all sides in any war had that respect for the other side, but this is life and, well, you knowMany of the actors are unknown to us, but they are all deserving of an Oscar as they couldn't have been any better and, this would be a tribute to them and to director Steven Spielberg.A more than pleasant aspect of this movie is that German and French characters spoke English. We didn't have to read sub-titles and in the back of our minds we knew, in reality, they spoke German and French. Having them speak English made for a more enjoyable movie and we were able to keep our eyes on the characters and not looking for and reading sub-titles. This is not an epic movie but it has almost all the parts to be one. The music was most appropriate. The cinematography is simply outstanding. The photography of the landscapes and war scenes is almost unreal. There are some landscape and sunset scenes which if you could take a still photo of, you would frame and hang on your wall. This is a complete and well-rounded story and it was over too soon for me. The whole family will enjoy this.Violence: Yes. Sex: No. Nudity: No. Language: No.",War Horse
75,Sergeant_Tibbs,Absolute trite.,3,10 July 2013,"It's been a good 10 years since I've been interested in a Steven Spielberg film, that last one being Minority Report, which is a fantastic sci-fi thriller I really like and have more nostalgia for than any Spielberg (Hook aside). Catch Me If You Can was okay, War Of The Worlds was awful, Munich wasn't my thing (though I'll give it another chance) and Indiana Jones 4 was a misfire. I'm not at all interested in seeing The Terminal and Tintin and I wanted to avoid War Horse too but unfortunately I had to sit through it. I expected it to be mediocre, but I didn't expect it to be this bad. It's absolute Spielberg parody. I didn't mind the film at first. It is an episodic film by nature of its Forrest Gump-esque material and the first two 'episodes' are okay, with Jeremy Irvine and Tom Hiddleston. The script is very contrived and the stage-like dialogue and mannerisms feel completely inappropriate for the potential of the screen but it was somewhat watchable for the first while as there were reasonable conflicts.Then the horse was transfered to Germans and Belgians and it turned into an exercise in absolute trite. With paper-thin clichéd characters simply exclaiming how they felt all the time, they were irritating. John Williams' score was in the background telling you how to feel and Janusz Kaminski's cinematography drenched the image in mists, never escaping the stage-like manner of the sets, making the image look flat and saturated. Jumping from uninteresting character to uninteresting character grew more tiresome the more characters we visited, especially as there's no reason to be compassionate for the horse besides him being an inherently innocent creature. It's pure contrived schmaltz and it's painful to watch as it takes itself so seriously. None of this film really works and the passable bits would be okay for an 80s TV movie. It's been 10 years since I've been excited for a Spielberg and I am excited for Lincoln. It's the last Oscar nominee of the year I have left to watch and I have to admit, War Horse has dampened my spirits a little bit as the worst Spielberg I've seen. Lets hope my trampled expectations result in pleasant surprise.3/10",War Horse
76,intelearts,496th Review: War Horse is good old-fashioned storytelling,8,20 March 2012,"One can argue that film is currently in flux - Hollywood is pushing for more social realism through films like Moneyball, the Descendants, and The Social Network, which is not bad per se, but we seeing some of the big name directors reacting against that in films like Hugo, the Artist, and War Horse.War Horse is unabashedly old-fashioned straight-up storytelling - it is an emotive and emotional piece that is designed to make up feel and to stir strong emotions - and to lose ourselves in a good historical drama. The plot is in the title, it is the story of Joey, a horse thoroughbred from a farm in Devon, who finds himself pushed into the hell of the birth of modern warfare in WWI. Spielberg uses both sentimentality and brusque images of trench warfare to contrast and heighten the emotions, and as always, with his commitment to war films, there is a degree of care in sets, costuming, and details that is immense. Special mention must be made also of the John Williams symphonic soundtrack - which has strong measures of Elgar and Vaughan-Williams in it, and is one of his most complex and complete scores.Where War Horse wins though is it is just a simple magnificent story magnificently told - the viewer is swept along by the scale and the humanity - and there are some who will not like that is it so romantic a film (in the strictest sense of being a large canvas), but it is a very satisfying and involving watch.All in all, if you like your film to move you and to be on a grand scale then the War Horse is a good watch indeed.",War Horse

That's the only complain I have about this film but nevertheless.Warhorse allows for a film to tell a great story without the use of C.G.I. over the top special effects or what have you. That's what missing about motion pictures most of the day is that the story gets push aside but Warhorse does restore the faith with films to focus on story telling an this one does a superb job.Even with a strong cast with Jermey Irvine, Emily Waston, Peter Mullan, Tom Hiddleston, Benedict Cumberbatch, Celine Buckens, Patrick Kennedy and others it only helps make the film much more a joy to watch because they each deserve well done performances in the film and goes to show how well Acting is suppose to be done.Music in the film also helps move the film along and when it's done by Mr.John Williams you will be given a wonderful piece of work because his music scores always deliver.So do yourself a favor and watch Warhorse it is a strong, emotional film with superb story telling about the struggles of War, Amazing well done music by Mr. Williams and well done acting by the cast.I give Warhorse an 8 out of 10",War Horse

Jeremy Irvine is the Perfect choice to play Albert and he does his part effortlessly & brings tears in eyes. It's rare to see an emotion so pure on screen. The young French girl Celine Buckens is delightful. Tom Hiddleston, Emily Watson and David Kross are good.

79,RNMorton,Poop,5,27 October 2013,"While there are elements of this that I sort of enjoyed and the basic concept of the movie could lead to fantastic places, I almost felt violated by the time we reached the closing credits. I've never been a big Spielberg guy, he's usually too gory and manipulative (with all regrets to Saving Private Ryan, including that one too), so I didn't have high expectations and accordingly wasn't that disappointed. What is it that distinguishes manipulation from a good story? I don't know, but as Judge Potter Stewart said (about obscenity) I know it when I see it. And I've never seen it more obviously than watching this dare I say it (like the lead comment) ""dreck"". So wonder horse raised by a boy in England gets drafted and ends up in WW1, boy goes over to find him with predictable results. I would say I could take this story and make a great movie out of it but it is so far from a good final product that I'll just say I could take this basic concept and make a much better movie from it.

81,TheUnknown837-1,This is sentimentalism at its very best!,8,6 January 2012,"""War Horse"" is the first live-action film that Steven Spielberg has made in three years, and although the wait was a long one, it was well worth it. For Mr. Spielberg, one of the very best of contemporary directors, has scored another winner to add to his more-than-impressive resume. The film critic of the New York Observer, Rex Reed once said that there were two sides to Steven Spielberg: the inner child, whimsical director and the serious-minded artist. Mr. Spielberg has shown the former in movies like ""E.T."", ""Raiders of the Lost Ark,"" and more recently, ""The Terminal"" and the latter in modern-day masterpieces like ""Schindler's List"" and ""Saving Private Ryan."" In ""War Horse,"" we get both.Despite some graphic violence, this is a movie that I recommend for audience members of all ages. But it's probably going to work best for adults who are still lucky enough to find their inner-child. ""War Horse"" is sometimes tough-going, violent, and a bit of a tear-jerker, but it's also a humanistic and sweepingly magical gem. It's set in early-20th century Europe, during the Great War. A farmer buys a spirited young colt at an auction, spending nearly all of his money simply to outbid and scorn his landowner, forgetting that he needs a plow horse to turn his soil. Instead, his son (Jeremy Irvine) takes it on himself to raise the horse. But alas, the war comes, and they are separated when the farmer has to sell the horse to the Army in order to pay off their rent. The rest of the movie follows the horse, and the people it comes into contact with, as the war erupts all over Europe.Now there is a weakness in the narrative written by Lee Hall and Richard Curtis, and this regards to their devotion to provide points-of-view of the people whom the horse interacts with. During its long trek to survive and get home, the war horse is picked up (and sometimes taken care of, and sometimes abused) by deserters, a peasant and his granddaughter, and soldiers from both the British and German armies. For some long stretches, the story breaks off from the horse to try and develop these additional human characters, half of whom, unfortunately, are not that interesting to deserve so much attention. Whereas it would have made a much more solid narrative to keep with the horse from the word go. That is why a battle scene, reminiscent of ""Saving Private Ryan"" in which the horse is absent and the humans play first-fiddle, seems to interrupt the flow.Thankfully, in this 146-minute movie, the horse does get most of the screen time to himself, although I would have preferred he gotten all of it. And here is where the movie really shines. Unlike other movies where the animal plays center stage, the horse does not all of a sudden become abnormally intelligent or anthropomorphic. He doesn't figure out how to set traps or do much of anything except try to escape danger and find his way home. And yet at the same time, the animal is not portrayed as a dumb, hopeless brute. A best summary of this would be one of the most splendid moments in the movie, where the horse is cornered in a battlefield, with a war tank trying to get through. Unable to escape, the horse obeys its instincts and bounds onto the roof of the tank, jumping over it, and fleeing into the countryside. And in a moment like this, and so expertly-directed, the spirit of the audience soars. Also, the relationship between the horse and Mr. Irving, as his owner, is very sweet and sentimental. Not sentimental in a sappy, sugary and fantasy-world way, but in an authentically heart-warming manner. As a result, it really does matter not only if both of them survive the war, but if they will meet up again at the end.""War Horse"" is well-acted, beautifully photographed by Oscar-winner Janusz Kaminski, and features another fantastic musical score by the always-reliable John Williams. But the real credit goes to Steven Spielberg as both director and the man who can find his inner-child. As director, he still demonstrates his profound gift at getting his camera in just the right place, toggling his frames in just the way that they need to be, and knowing when and where to place a locked-down shot as opposed to a traveling one. But, as he has demonstrated for so many years, his real gift is finding the magic that is treasured and adored by a child, and combining both of these together in a way that really works. That way being, so that anybody who can remember what it was like to be a child, and has fond memories of those times, can find their spirits soaring with joy. This is sentimentalism at its very best.Leave it to Steven Spielberg to make one of the year's best movies.",War Horse
82,brchthethird,"The story of a boy and his horse - touching, but overly sentimental",6,8 February 2015,"Steven Spielberg has a certain type of film he makes really well, a sentimental one, and WAR HORSE is a perfect example of that for better or worse. The story follows a horse from birth, auction, and through WWI as he goes through a succession of owners. He might be the luckiest horse I've ever seen (or the unluckiest, depending on how you look at it). Through it all, he shows determination and manages to get through everything that life throws at him. Of course, this film suffers from what a lot of animal-centric films suffer from: the main character has a lack of agency in their own story. There is little reason to care about what happens to this horse beyond human compassion for animals. And since this film aims to be somewhat realistic, meaning no voices or internal monologue (like BLACK BEAUTY), you don't get a sense of what is going through its head outside of the physical performance. That leaves the character development to the human cast and, due to the nature of the story, we don't really get to spend that much time with any of them before they are jettisoned so that we can move on to the next chapter in the horse's life. There were several recognizable character actors (some distractingly so), but none of them are really given much to do. They take a backseat to the horse at the center of the story who, as I've previously mentioned, isn't too much of a character. Stuff happens to him, but that's it. The only two moments that brought genuine emotion out in me were a scene in which a horse is put down, and the scene in which Joey (the main horse) is reunited with his first owner. Everything else beyond that felt overly staged, contrived or there because of necessity to the plot. Outside of the story, though, everything else was spectacular. Reuniting with his cinematographer from SAVING PRIVATE RYAN, Steven Spielberg crafted some beautiful images staged some excellent battle sequences. Given the PG-13 rating, it's a bit toned down from what he did previously but nonetheless just as effective. And of course the acting was all very good, even if most of the cast were just playing filler characters. I even liked John Williams' score which complemented the film very nicely. Overall, I could take or leave the sappy nature of the story, but Steven Spielberg has made such a beautiful film that it is possible to overlook some of the other faults. It's not his greatest work, but it makes for a decent, non-challenging watch.",War Horse
83,proud_luddite,Sometimes good but too much sentiment,6,9 January 2021,"The film tells the tale of a horse and all the people moved by his presence. His tale begins in an English farm and continues into other countries during World War I.Director Steven Spielberg shows his usual deft hand here particularly with the battle scenes. The story is also interesting for showing the humanness of German soldiers (aka the ""enemy"") and how they are equally moved by the horse.There are some moments that just seem too implausible for a war. This might have worked for the acclaimed theatre play on which this film is partially based. Live theatre has a way of allowing viewers to suspend into make-believe. This is less easy to do in film.Just as Spielberg can be a brilliant director, he can also overwhelm with too much sentimentality. His best films can be sugar-coated (E.T.) where it can work well for some but be cringeworthy for others. Even his ""adult"" films (Schindler's List, Saving Private Ryan) have sentimentality at the end that devalue the great work in the films before those moments.This film includes music by frequent Spielberg collaborator John Williams. Together, they can create sentimental magic or become schlockmeisters. They do more of the latter in ""War Horse"". When the music blends with scenes of silhouettes against beautiful sunsets, one almost expects to hear a choir of happy children shouting ""Ya just gotta BELIEEEEEVE!!!!""",War Horse
84,Joxerlives,The Great War spelled out through the experiences of an animal,8,7 September 2014,"Watched this in an open air screening of this film in Histon, Cambridgeshire. Pretty damn wonderful and people actually stood up and clapped at the end. I was always cynical about the depiction of the UK (and Europe in general) before 1914, the Edwardian age was not a time of prosperity and tolerance but of creeping nationalist extremism, colonial exploitation and grinding poverty for the working classes(although it pales in comparison with the Victorian era, the European's a potato famine, neglect of the poor etc). It's a nice touch that the landlord's son turns out to be a good decent man on the battlefield, not that his father is actually a villain, he's just a ruthless capitalist. I would have loved a scene where we have a flashback to the Boer War and we find that one man stopped to help his wounded fellow soldiers and the other walked over them to take the enemy position and saved countless lives in the long term. The depiction of British society pre-1914 was interesting, it was by no means a golden age and whilst it was horrific the Great War would sweep away many of the inequalities of Edwardian society. Tom Hiddleston as the cavalry officer who takes care of Joey is great, appearing for all the world like the stereotypical upper class villain but actually extremely heroic, the scene where we witness the end of an era as the cavalry versus machine guns is heartrending, you're so glad his friend with the soft cap survives. The tale of the 2 brothers is awfully conflicting, you can only think it would have been better if they had been killed/wounded in action rather than shot as deserters together (all credit to Steven Spielberg for the masterful shot with the windmill sails obscuring their execution). Interesting how we have the gradual evolution of the war from Napoleonic style cavalry charges (their end signified by the sabre plunged into the ground in 1914) to the mechanized hell of tanks, mud and artillery we see by 1918, Joey jumping the tank and the scene with him being caught in the barbed wire showing that humanity still prevails in the most extreme of circumstances. Not that this film shy's away from the horror of the Great War, the sequences where the troops are enveloped by gas or take out a machine gun nest with grenades, shooting the enemy soldiers manning it, shows the brutal reality of trench combat, kill or be killed, walk past the dead or dying for the sake of the greater good. I'm surprised they missed a scene where they bayonet someone? By the time we get to 1918 your heart is in your mouth, seeing the snowflakes and knowing that the war will end at 11am 11th November 1918 and just praying that the characters will live to see the Armstice. The ending cannot fail to raise a tear, Johnny comes marching home to his mother and father's arms with his warhorse as silent witness is a scene which is always great (Celia Emrie magnificent as ever). Just wish the belligerent goose was there to see it all. The real tragedy of it all is the little French girl and her grandfather, you hope that they will both survive the war but he does and she doesn't, it really brought a tear to my eye, you so wanted her and the hero to get together and live happily ever after but they don't, the Great War robbed so many of their loved ones whether deserving or not, it's as though Heidi were killed in the Franco-Prussian War. I would also liked to have known what happened to the German private who took care of Joey and his companion during their wartime service. All told a wonderful film and one that bears repeated viewing.",War Horse
85,classicalsteve,Forced Melodrama Compromises Otherwise Compelling Film,7,21 April 2012,"At the forefront of a compelling movie are the characters and a gripping storyline, and War Horse certainly has both. At the same time, all or at least most of the crucial events need to be believable if the film is to escalate into the higher echelons. Unfortunately, War Horse juxtaposes between the starkly real and forced sentimentality. While some episodes were edge-of-your seat mesmerizing, other parts felt like the storytellers were forcing the issue. Particularly at two or three of the most vital scenes of the film, ""oh you can't be serious"" brought the movie out of its believability and into overt melodrama, such as in ""Sleepless in Seattle"" and ""Forrest Gump"". The film could have been a genuinely profound statement of survival and redemption if it hadn't lowered its standards in a few places, particularly at the end. Instead, it tries to make the audience merely feel good, which is at odds with so much of the rest of film.The main thrust is the tried-and-true formula of two kindred spirits attempting to be re-united; in this case a boy and his beloved horse. A family only a couple of generations removed from a medieval-like existence in Northern England are on the brink of starvation and eviction when the drunkard father bids for a horse. Only the amount is about 3 to 4 times the horse's worth. And worse yet, he outbid his own landlord who is owed several months back rent. This beginning worked fine for me as it sets up the ideas of bad judgment and desperation. Somehow they have to make their animal bring a return on their investment by using it to plow their barren fields, or they'll be out in the snowy streets. How this unfolds works, more and less, until mother-nature destroys their plans. In the meantime, the boy Albert bonds with the horse as only young adults and horses can, as we have seen in other stories like ""the Black Stallion"" and ""National Velvet"". The bonding was a bit forced and at one point I knew immediately one element of their relationship would be recapitulated later. But even given that I was willing to run with it. However, one problem with cliché is ultimately it's boring.Next, the boy wakes up one morning to find the stable empty. He races to town where his horse has been sold to a regiment in the British Army about to embark in the conflict known then as the Great War, now called World War I. The horse has been sold for near its asking price to a young colonel. At this point, I felt the film had disrobed its cloak of sentimentality and the real story begins. The horse also befriends another black stallion owned by another young officer, and the two become almost like the animal-equivalent of Tom Sawyer and Huck Finn engaging in unimaginable adventures.What makes War Horse interesting from this point forward, and ultimately saves it as a film, is that we follow the horse and his friend as the main characters of the story. We experience the war literally through the horses' eyes as it travels to the European Continent, fights in battles, changes hands, finding enemies and friends on both sides. The horses even find an alley or two among the Germans. At one point, we know a bond has developed between the two horses. Several times, the horses are employed to assist in the transportation of decidedly 20th-century technology; the old technology helping out the new. Another quite compelling moment involves the main horse trapped in the middle of so-called No-Mand's Land between the English and German trenches. These episodes were so un-cliché that I was riveted at every moment.However, about 3/4's through the story, the young Albert re-appears, now as a low-rank soldier in the conflict. And here, for me, it began to go downhill. Of course, we as the audience desire the horse and the boy to be re-united. But how this plays out seemed just too convenient to be believable. At one moment when it appears all is lost, the story took an obvious favorable turn and I didn't buy it. I found myself shaking my head and saying ""oh brother"". I wished I could have grabbed the script and given the work a better ending. Unfortunately, the ending rang more of a cliché you might find in a Harlequinn Romance than a compelling story about a horse during World War I.Still, there are many good things in War Horse, and much to praise, but it also made the entire experience feel like the film didn't know which way it wanted to travel, a sentimental ""feel good"" paved street or the much more profound dirt road of thwarted desires because of human conflict. Which makes its obvious weakness all the more frustrating. When Claude Rains says ""Round up the usual suspects"" in ""Casablanca"" or the boy in ""Empire of the Sun"" is finally re-united with his parents, you never once think it was contrived, that the writers forced the story into a particular direction. It all feels natural. The ending of War Horse was disappointing because so many other aspects lacked the cooked-up feel of the end. For this reason endings are not always easy, and finding the ending which is both satisfying and natural makes the difference between a good film and a great one. This one could have been great but ranks as only merely good. Darn.",War Horse
86,Andy-296,"Sentimental but well made, entertaining",8,24 November 2013,"This sentimental (though just short of mawkish) movie, directed by Steven Spielberg, is about a horse from a farm in the English countryside which is sent to the front lines in France at the beginning of World War I. Much more things happen, and its young owner, Albert (Jeremy Irvine), itself a soldier in the conflict, will try to get reunited to his beloved horse. Well made, entertaining. Perhaps the film's best scene has the British troops charging over the Germans in a forest. The photography showing the pretty countryside of England and France helps a lot. Emily Watson and Peter Mullan appear as the parents of Albert. Other known actors also appear in the film, including Benedict Cumberlatch and Niels Arestrup as a French farmer who takes care of the horse.",War Horse
87,adamscastlevania2,An impossible film to dislike,9,19 April 2015,"(88%) Spielberg does what Spielberg does so well in creating a big crowd pleaser with tons and tons of heart. With more than a touch of Black beauty this shows with great power the plight of animals during wartime. What sets this apart a little differently from quite a lot of modern big films is the sheer simplicity in its storytelling which by and large works very well in what is a very simple plot that benefits from its near black and white structure. The best aspect for me is the fact that the horse is the main focus almost for the entire film meaning you really do feel for the animal. The human characters do come and go throughout, which highlights an issue of there being a touch too many of them, but that's a minor issue in what is a really well made, very watchable hit.",War Horse

All the goody two shoes stuff in it simply doesn't happen either in bad wars or good war movies. Indeed, the early farm scenes in England have something of a surreal,thatched cottage Disney quality to them. Having said that, this is a very well done film. The photography is original and often stunning and the WWI battlefield scenes are probably the best I've seen. Spielberg is a master and you do not expect the ordinary from him. This is far from from an ordinary film. Decide before you start watching whether you want to see a fairy tale or a war movie. It can be either one.I favour the fairy tale.

90,cultfilmfan,War Horse,10,3 January 2012,"War Horse is based on the novel of the same name by Michael Morpurgo and also before this film version the novel was also a stage play. The film takes place just slightly before the first world war and focuses on a teenager named Albert, whose father at the market auction has just purchased a horse. Albert, is fascinated by this horse and soon tries to train it and when he discovers that the horse will obey his commands and has become quite attached to him, he befriends it and calls it Joey. World War I then breaks out and Albert's father who is in desperate need for money, sells Joey to one of the English soldiers going to fight in the war and Albert hopes that one day he will be reacquainted with his beloved horse and the rest of the film takes place in the trenches and battlefields of the war as well as some other people and places the story and it's characters will introduce to us. Overall, I thought War Horse was a fantastic film. Everything about it from in front of and behind the camera was done to the best of everyone's abilities and it was performed and executed beautifully. The story itself is a very heartwarming one filled with moments of inspiration and joy as well as also moments of sadness, but I think most people will come out of the theatre feeling really good about what they just saw because of how inspirational and heartwarming the film is. It takes place during war, yes, but it doesn't focus all it's time and energy on the brutality of war. We do lose characters and they are killed due to the war, but the film is not concerned about violence, or gore, but instead about telling a story about a friendship between a young man and his horse that will shine through and give hope to the both of them during a very trying and difficult period, which not only gives them hope, but some of the others in the war as well and us the audience watching it. Without giving too much away we also see that these soldiers in the war have no pride, or glory in being in the war, or having to kill others, but are simply doing so, either because they had to, or for the duty of their country. They do not object, but you can see into their eyes and souls and see that the horrific and violent parts are certainly not for them and if they had any way out of it, that they would certainly take it. An interesting perspective on a story that deals with war. One that we are not always as accustomed to in the movies. The performances are mostly done here by relatively unknown actors, but they all do an excellent job here. I also have to give credit to the many animals used in the film as well as the people who trained them because they do a great job as well and in some scenes you almost wonder how they pulled it off. The direction is very good here and everything looks and feels authentic to the time period and the cinematography of the film is also very good by showing us the bleak and dirty trenches of the war battlefields and at other times beautiful shots of the English countryside and sunsets and natural beauty such as that. Both times it works and it is a very good looking film. The film is a bit longer, but I felt that it had a really good pace to it and found it quite entertaining and involving the whole way through. I really enjoyed this story about friendship, survival, love and human nature that instead of showing the bleak and cynical, instead gives us something to cheer and feel good about. It definitely gave me something to think about after I saw it and I would say that I felt pretty good and my mood uplifted after seeing this film. The movie does contain some war violence, but none of it is overly graphic, so I would say that this is a perfect film for the whole family to enjoy with something for everybody in it. This is one of the finest achievements of 2011 and also one of the best films of last year.",War Horse
91,Quietb-1,Super horse tale,8,31 December 2011,"They will need a horse trailer to haul home the awards. Steven Spielberg doesn't do anything in a small way. Here he opens up a novel and play into an epic movie.Perhaps he will only get nominations for Best Director and Best Picture but there are a slew of technical and creative awards that will be won. Cinematography for sure. Costume Design, Art Direction, Set Design and of course the John Williams Score seem likely.The movie is too long and drags a bit when the horse is not on screen. Some of the situations were derivative of the animated horse story ""Spirit: Stallion of the Cimarron"". The war violence makes it unsuitable for younger children.It doesn't pack quite as much of the emotional wallop as some of the other Spielberg films that deal with human aspects of war. It is beautiful to watch and deserves the applause it receives at the fade-out. See it.",War Horse
92,agmoldham,Not quite as emotional as I expected,5,26 February 2012,"Prior to seeing War Horse I had been told that it was a very emotional film and definitely one where you'd be in tears.The film tells the story of a horse that (unsurprisingly) gets involved in the 1st world war. Prior to the war the horse is brought up by a young man Albert Narracott (Jeremy Irvine) who loves the horse through many adventures. When the horse joins the war effort against his wishes, Albert joins up in an attempt to be reunited with the horse. Personally I found the film reasonably entertaining, but I never felt any great empathy for the horse. Consequently it wasn't really a weepy film from my point of view. This is definitely one of Spielberg's better recent films, but not quite scaling the heights of his early career. Worth a watch though!",War Horse
93,Danusha_Goska,"Beautiful, Profound, Recommended",9,27 December 2011,"""War Horse"" is a visually beautiful, profound film. It uses a very sentimental, crowd-pleasing story about a boy and his horse to depict the horrors of war. Without the crowd-pleasing story, the war scenes would be almost unbearable to watch. If you love horses, you will float out of the theater on a river of your own tears. I'm not a horse person, but I cried. Audience members clapped out loud at the screening I attended. Albert Narracott is a farm boy from Devon. Joey is his horse. Joey is sold into the army for World War I. Albert is heartbroken. The story follows Joey, the horse, and his war experiences. Albert re-enters the story later. Joey's war experiences are horrific. There are scenes in this movie that are as bleak as anything I've seen in a war movie. The author of the book on which the film is based estimated that ten million horses were destroyed in World War One. The film depicts some of that carnage. This film's brilliance and gift is that it forces audiences to confront the horror of war from a new perspective. Perhaps we have grown callous to human suffering in war. ""War Horse"" shows us how war destroys animals, as well as people. Of the many stand-out scenes, two are worth mentioning. Joey breaks free of his captors and runs through a no-man's-land of trenches and barbed wire. This magnificent animal struggling and trapped in a man-made hell – it's hard to watch. Later, one British soldier and one German soldier, Colin and Peter, work together to free Joey from the barbed wire. Just thinking of this scene brings tears. The scene speaks loudly about how humans choose war, even though they don't have to. It evokes historical events, like the Christmas truce of 1914, when British and German troops left their trenches, sang ""Silent Night"" to each other, played football, and chose against war, at least for a few hours. ""War Horse"" is beautiful to look at. You see all the craftsmanship – Steven Spielberg's direction and Janusz Kaminski's cinematography – on screen. There's almost no computer-generated images, and you can tell. ""War Horse"" is one of those rare movies that one can recommend to almost any movie-goer.",War Horse
94,ajs-10,As good as they say?... I think so...,9,18 January 2012,"Ever since I first saw 'Jaws', 'Close Encounters of the Third Kind' and E.T.' I have been a fan of the work of Steven Spielberg. He is an excellent storyteller and I love the look and feel of his films, particularly those made for a broader audience. After the disappointment I felt after seeing 'Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull' (I hadn't seen 'The Adventures of Tintin: The Secret of the Unicorn' at the time of writing so couldn't comment on that one), it was with a little trepidation that I entered the cinema to see his latest offering. I shouldn't have worried; the critics had given it a warm reception and I have to say they were right. With 'War Horse' Spielberg hits all the right notes! I will give you my thoughts on it after this brief summary.We start before the outbreak of World War I, young Albert lives with his parents Ted and Rose on a small farm on Dartmoor (that's in Devon, England for those that don't know). Ted has always been a drinker and one day he comes back from the local horse auction with a thoroughbred colt. Rose is not best pleased but Albert promises to break him and that he will even get him to plough their field. This he does, but as war breaks out Ted has to sell the horse, called Joey by the way, to the army. Albert is heartbroken not only because he is losing his beloved horse, but also because he's too young to volunteer so he can be with him. He vows that they will be together again as they part company. We now follow Joey and his trials and tribulations in the war. He ends up seeing things from both the British and German side and even spends some time in the care of some French civilians. I will not say any more here because I really don't want to give the game away or have the Spoiler Police riding after me again.Beautifully shot with some quite stunning scenes; I really love the cinematography on this one. This is all backed up with a really great score by John Williams, he has collaborated with Spielberg for many years and I think this is one of his finest pieces of work to date. As for performances, well nobody put a foot wrong; Jeremy Irvine did a great job as Albert Narracott, as did Peter Mullan as Ted and Emily Watson as Rose. Also worthy of note were Niels Arestrup as Grandfather, David Thewlis as Lyons, Tom Hiddleston as Captain Nicholls, Benedict Cumberbatch as Maj. Jamie Stewart and Celine Buckens as Emilie. Finally, of course, I cannot end this section without a mention for the horses that portrayed Joey in the movie; they all did a tremendous job, as did their trainers.Before seeing this film I had talked to several people about it; many of which stated that they couldn't watch a film like that in the cinema, it would be too upsetting. I admit, yes, there are some upsetting moments in the film, but I didn't find it all that bad. I may have reacted differently watching it at home alone, but I don't think that would have affected my enjoyment of it in any way. There are many plusses in this film that outweigh the few minuses; yes, it's a bit on the sentimental side, but it's still a beautifully made sprawling epic and well worth a look (IMO) Recommended.My score: 8.6/10.IMDb Score: 7.4/10 (based on 9,616 votes when this review was written).Rotten Tomatoes 'Tomatometer' Score: 78/100 (based on 188 reviews counted at the time of going to press).Rotten Tomatoes 'Audience' Score: 76/100 (based on 23,610 user ratings counted at the time of going to press).",War Horse
95,itamarscomix,Hollywood of Yesteryear Reborn,7,18 February 2012,"The cynic in me was warring with my inner child while watching War Horse, shouting at him to not enjoy it. But I did. It's true that a film like War Horse seems to have no room in today's film industry; its sense of aesthetics and naive optimism feel like they belong in the 40's and 50's. And indeed, there's very little about War Horse that feels like it belongs in the 21st century - the dialog and cinematography feel dated to begin with. The fact that the viewer is still able to suspend disbelief and enjoy it is a testament to Spielberg's unique talent and his knack for the melodramatic - he successfully revived the magic of old Hollywood, and for the first time since Jurassic Park managed to create an old-fashioned adventure story that defies cynicism and is truly grandiose and impressive.War Horse isn't all nostalgia, though; it's subtle, but it manages to be relevant and make its own statement in-between. While the film adheres to a pretty naive and old-fashioned sense of morality, it doesn't go for the black and white morals that usually go with it; the film does make an interesting statement about war, and about the loss people suffer during wars, all the while delivering a solid history lesson for the kid. Indeed - War Horse is a family movie in the fullest sense of the words, because it can be watched by the entire family and have added value for the children too. The term 'family movie' usually refers to a children's movie, and War Horse is anything but, but I can't imagine any sound parent objecting in any way to what it has to say.War Horse's biggest flaw, as several reviewers mentioned before, it lack of emotional connection to the main characters. Indeed, Albie is probably the weakest, flattest character in the entire film; and his connection to his horse doesn't really work either, as we don't get to feel much for the horse as a character, it doesn't work as a 'A Boy and his X' type story. I felt more sympathy for some of the other characters, like Albie's father (an abusive alcoholic in the source material, mind you) or the ones played by Benedict Cumberbatch and Niels Arestrup. If you take it as an allegory and a statement about war and human nature, as I took it and as I think Spielberg intended it, it all works quite well.",War Horse
96,witster18,"alright, I'm gonna call out every reviewer who scored this under 5...",7,25 March 2012,"Why?Because, even if you want to nit-pick, 4rth grade bully your way into a negative review, you just can't pass ""this movie is terrible"" onto people who haven't seen it; not and call yourself a fan of film.These are probably the same hoodlums scoring ""Take Me Home Tonight"" and ""Transformers 2"" above the 6point-mark. Another average story executed extremely well, ""Hugo"", was received with much more praise and critical acclaim. For me, both were good, but I found ""War Horse"" to be more exciting, and no less the visual spectacle.This movie isn't perfect, but I always know a movie is going to be good when people say stuff like ""It's unrealistic"", or ""It's full of cliché's"", or whatever lame excuse they can think of to NOT like a film. It's an instant ""I need to watch it moment"". And, I was rewarded YET AGAIN. Thank You uneducated film-viewers and young adults who haven't been fortunate enough to look back at what REAL films look like, and what ""real"" films do. You know,.. tell a realistically paced story, take some time and effort(without just folding and calling in the geek squad) to make it look really good, AND keep it period correct. Spielberg attached his Executive Producer name to ""Tin Tin"" and ""Super-8"", and then proceeded to make a low-key, children's book PG movie about the struggles of war, AND he surpassed his understudies! And then we have to come on here to IMDb and see countless reviews at 1 or 2/10!!! ARE you KIDDING ME? Come on IMDb members! You can do better than that! .This isn't a great movie, but it IS a good one.Every great story has unbelievable moments. If they didn't have them - they wouldn't be great now would they?And enough with the foreigners speaking English arguments!!! We're the country that can't appreciate a foreign film because of subtitles, REMEMBER! We are the reason directors like Spielberg feel like they need to ""dumb it up"". That's why films like ""Twilight Samurai"", and ""A Very Long Engagement"" are relative unknowns to American audiences - because most Americans don't have the patience to read subtitles or appreciate ANYTHING made from outside of the country(that's NOT sold at walmart anyway). The ease of understanding for the target audience is probably another reason Spielberg did this. He can't win either way with nit-pick reviewers - that's how I see it.Jean-Pierre Jeunet used/stole(if you will) certain shots and ideas from Spielberg's ""Saving Private Ryan"" in Jeunet's great film, ""A Very Long Engagement"", and then not-so-coincidentally but somewhat ironically, Spielberg stole some ideas BACK for ""War Horse"". We're talking about two of the better director's who are cinematographer's first, on the entire planet, and any attacks at the look of this film(as with the 'look' of just about any the two have made) are as ridiculous as not liking the idea of drawing inspiration from others. For me, the look alone of the film dismisses any low score. Any review under 5 should be stricken from the record, and the reviewer noted as an untrustworthy source. I'll read a review that says 5 or 6 and try to appreciate what they have to say, but if you rated this film a 1 or a 2, well, I feel sorry for you. On the bright side, you won't have to wait long for another CGI-infested, emotionless popcorn-fest to hit your local theater.A lot of care and effort went into this production. Now, whether or not you can appreciate it, that's up to you.71/100You'll like this if you liked:Saving Private Ryan(better), A Very Long Engagement(better), The Black Stallion(better), Hidalgo(not as good), or Flags of Our Father's(not as good).",War Horse

Edited well, the film has a very good flow and there's pretty much not anything to complain about (which, for me, is somewhat rare!).

99,jdkraus,Stunning and beautiful entertainment by Spielberg and his team!,9,1 January 2012,"Steven Spielberg, the master filmmaker of our time brings us another professionally executed achievement. ""War Horse"" is a simple story about a boy who raises a horse named Joey, only to lose it for the battlefields of WWI. Slightly along the lines of ""Black Beauty,"" the film follows Joey as he struggles to survive the horrors of war as well as encounter new people who temporarily become his owners. The relationship between Joey and the people he meets throughout the picture is what really sells this film. With these friendships, there comes witty humor, tragedy, a lot of sentimentality, and some compelling scenes. All of these are ingredients for an epic, family oriented feat. Unlike the blood and gore-fest ""Saving Private Ryan,"" Spielberg's focus is on this horse's incredible journey, which makes a much better movie. The cast is mostly decent. Being honest, I felt Jeremy Irvine as the boy Albert went overboard with emotion, making his performance seem more like a soap opera than a movie. Overall though, Emily Watson, Niels Arestrup, David Thewlis, and Tom Hiddleston make a nice supporting cast. But who's the driving force? The horse. He conveys such emotion with his eyes that my concern lies with him versus with the people. When he's hurt, I feel his pain. When he's happy, I'm giddy. When has there ever been an animal in cinema that has created such a feeling? I have not experienced it until I saw this movie!The other thing I have to praise about this movie is Janusz Kaminski's cinematography. Winner of 2 Oscars (both of which for Spielberg movies), he deserves a third one for this. The camera angles/movement, composition, and lighting deliver this movie as an epic masterwork. Whether it is the beautiful landscape shots, the gritty battle scenes, or even the aesthetic close ups, it is flawless. The ending scene in particular pays homage to the old John Ford films and ""Gone with the Wind."" John Williams score delivers one of his finest works here. It is very present during the feature. Some may call this bombastic, but it actually heightens the movie's emotional impact rather than blending into the background. Williams is a genius when it comes to playing with emotions, and his brilliance certainly comes to work in this film. The other technical aspects: sound, sets, props, and costumes, mesh together well. ""War Horse"" is another master achievement by Spielberg and his team, but it is not his best. As mentioned earlier, I was not very impressed with Jeremy Irvine's performance; much of this has to deal with his thick accent. It felt out of place. The ending could have been better, too. It was predictable; there needed to be a surprise. In addition, everyone speaks English in this movie. This includes the Germans and the French. I can see this as a shortcut to avoid subtitles, but it makes the movie feel less real. The Germans should be speaking their native language. I doubt many of them knew English during WWI. Okay, now I'm getting nit-picky. ""War Horse,"" is a very good, entertaining movie that is both stunning and beautiful to watch. 9/10",War Horse
100,Likes_Ninjas90,"It summaries everything we've come to know about Spielberg's career: it's beautiful, moving and intense but also embarrassingly corny and sentimental",6,21 December 2011,"Prior to the start of the First World War, a boy named Albert (Jeremy Irvine) is playing with his horse Joey on an open field, until it is taken away to be sold on the markets. Albert's father Ted (Peter Mullan) bids on the horse at an auction and buys it back, even though he can't afford it. This is to the distress of his wife Rose (Emily Watson), who is worried they won't be able to keep their land. They can keep their property only if Albert can train Joey to till the soil for them. When the First World War outbreaks, the horse is sold to the military and travels across the battlefields. It also manages to find its way onto the property of a Frenchman (Niels Arestrup) and his granddaughter Emilie (Celine Buckens). As he initially too young to enlist, Albert must wait a few years to try to recapture his horse. There are some scenes in War Horse that I will never forget and a few I'd like to. In two hours and twenty minutes, it summaries everything we've come to know about Spielberg's career: it's beautiful, moving and intense but also embarrassingly corny and sentimental. He's adapted the story from a play, which itself was based on a children's novel by Michael Morpurgo. Yet too often here does Spielberg compromise his own cinematic vision of hell. Spielberg is forever fixated on the idea of 'the lost child'. Children in danger, separated from their families, have formed the staples of each of his narratives. It regularly leads him into narcissistic traps of cheap sentiment and emotion. Why is one of the most distinguishable filmmakers in history incapable of taking a risk? It is a frustrating question because there are few directors who are as knowledgeable about cinematic formalism as Spielberg. Watching this film on the silver screen for the scale alone is a pleasure. Spielberg reuses a lot of the same aesthetic techniques from Saving Private Ryan (1998) to stunning effect. The early scenes are widely shot on open green hills and reflect the freedom of childhood and stability. Yet the interior of Albert's house, where his parents have discussions about their future, are dark and moody, with faint light pouring in through the windows. There is a separation between the adult and child life. These two worlds collide when Spielberg contrasts the high saturation of the early scenes with the thick, heavy mud of the battlefield, showing that is no safe ground here for man or child. Spielberg is also fascinated by modernity and invention as an extension of the unknown and its crippling effect on the natural world. These are interesting themes and the film soars when it finds clear, interesting visual ways of addressing them. This includes one of the most extraordinary battle scenes I can remember since Saving Private Ryan. Soldiers rise up from their trenches, attempting to cross into 'No Man's Land', as they are rapidly cut down by machine gun fire. It is a familiar scenario but rarely has it been captured with this much realism or authenticity. Also distinctive is that we have never seen machine gun batteries, soldiers and tanks, photographed like they are here. It is an alienating experience because these instruments of war are framed with such tight close-ups that they seem foreign to us. There is a shot after Albert crosses the lines that has haunted me. He sees a soldier lying dead on the ground and his face is covered by a heavy gas mask that makes him appear alien-like. Equally moving is when we see the British cavalry charging towards enemy lines and the horses pulling huge artillery cannons up the hills. These scenes are reflective of the stranglehold modern inventions have over all that is natural in contemporary warfare. For many of these touching qualities Spielberg's narrative is surprisingly undisciplined. Characters disappear for long stretches, or in the case of two brothers, they never return at all. I was pleased that Spielberg touched on a German perspective but there's a lack of balance in how much time some characters have and an impatience to draw the threads together through a contrived deus ex machina. For every soul crushing scene there is one that is overly sentimental. Spielberg's technique is to play with tone so he can make us smile at one moment and then maximise our wincing. There are 'nice', 'pleasant' scenes here of geese chasing men by the ankles and the little French girl Emilie trying to train Joey. These are harmless alone and sometimes funny but it spoils the opportunity for something darker, more cautionary and truthful. The film is often flat-out cringing when it focuses on Albert because he doesn't seem like a real boy, with real problems but more of an avenue for Spielberg to channel forced emotions. He runs along hills, whispering to his horse that they'll be together. His whole performance is artificial, existing more on a cue with John Williams rising score, than a natural embodiment. Watson is far more believable, terrific as the hard, long-suffering mother. After seeing War Horse, I thought back to Peter Weir's WWI film Gallipoli (1981) and its troubling mid-frame conclusion. Comparing the two films, one is restrained, moderate and in touch with the reality of war. The other is, at its end, another Hollywood fantasy.",War Horse

That is true talent, especially if both movies are really good. The Adventures of Tintin was hilarious and almost too much fun. War Horse, which got 6 Oscar nominations, was just as good.Based on the Broadway play, a farmer adopts a horse. From there the farmer's son(played by Jeremy Irvine) develops a close relationship with it, and once it is sold off, he promises that they will meet again. The rest of the film chronicles this horse as he goes from owner to owner, and battle to battle.Keep in mind, War Horse is a commitment. Clocking in at over 2 hours and 20 minutes, it requires you to hang in there. And that is just what I did. War Horse is a really good film with terrific cinematography and war sequences that will take your breath away. It's a really good film that is right up there with TheAdventures of Tintin.That said, it's not quite perfect. It is way too long. But at it's heart you know that Spielberg was born to direct this. War Horse is E.T. combined with Saving Private Ryan, two of Spielberg's finest works of art. Although I can't quite call it one of Spielberg's best, I will say that it is one 2011's best films.A-",War Horse

103,virek213,Spielberg Goes Back To World War I,10,26 December 2011,"Since his films have accumulated somewhere in the neighborhood of $7.5 billion overall, and following the Oscar wins as Best Director in 1993 for SCHINDLER'S LIST, and 1998 for SAVING PRIVATE RYAN, director Steven Spielberg can pretty much make any film he wants, and not worry about whether it has commercial potential or not. Such is the case with his epic World War I drama WAR HORSE.Based on Michael Morpurgo's book of the same name, and set in England and mainland Europe during the period of 1914 through 1918, the years of World War I, WAR HORSE stars Jeremy Irvine as a young English lad who trains a seemingly unsuited-for-farming horse that his well-meaning but doddering father (Peter Mullan), much to the chagrin of his mother (Emily Watson), picked up at an auction in their hometown of Devon. Irvine manages to train this horse to be a solid plowing animal and also learns to ride it with sureness and dispatchthat is, until World War I breaks out, and he has to hand over the horse to the English army, which needs every able-bodied man and animal possible (this being before motor vehicles and airplanes came into being in warfare). The rest of the film depicts this war horse's journeys throughout war-torn France, as it alternately comes into possession of a young French girl (Celine Buckens), and then, ironically, into the hands of a well-meaning and more humane German soldier (David Kross). Irvine is finally reunited with his long-lost companion after he has become an enlisted English soldier and almost been killed in a gas attack during some intense trench warfare.It is very tempting to think that Spielberg took on this project because it involved the interaction of animals with humans, but that would have been extremely obvious (not to mention dubious and manipulative as well). Besides, anyone who knows anything about Spielberg's cinematic output knows that so many of his films have tended to be set in the past, like the World War II settings of SCHINDLER'S LIST and SAVING PRIVATE RYAN; the America of the 1830s for the 1997 film AMISTAD; and the America of the 1960s for 2002's CATCH ME IF YOU CAN. In WAR HORSE, Spielberg goes back close to a full century to World War I, which was supposed to be the War To End All Wars; and while what he depicts in the situations involving either Irvine, the horse itself, or both of them is not as graphic or heartbreaking as what he showed in SCHINDLER'S LIST or PRIVATE RYAN, he is still true to the historical fact of the earlier war, with its depiction of cavalry troops, trenches, and the first-ever use of chemical weaponry in war, where thousands of troops on either side were killed or burned by it.There are unavoidable, albeit unintentional, references to other past films that are among the director's favorites, such as the depiction of Irvine's English homestead, reminiscent of John Ford's 1952 classic THE QUIET MAN and Stanley Kubrick's 1975 18th century period piece BARRY LYNDON; and the scenes of World War I echo those of Kubrick's 1957 classic PATHS OF GLORY (the scenes in the trenches), and Lewis Milestone's 1930 World War I epic ALL QUIET ON THE WESTERN FRONT. Spielberg is wise enough, however, to let those references slip in via the storyline itself and not by his direction, which is as good as anything he has done throughout his career. More than just a depiction of war, family, and human/animal interaction, WAR HORSE is, at its heart, clearly a human drama of the first order, a triumph of the human spirit, in which humanity's best comes out to balance off its worst traits. John Williams' music score, with its combination of British and Irish influences, is one of his best as well; and the largely unknown English cast (excepting Watson) is excellent as well. In the end, War Horse can be counted as a triumph for Spielberg, especially since it is with material that no one ever expected of him. It is also easily one of the best films of 2011.",War Horse
104,roedyg,Disappointing,6,26 November 2014,"This is the story of a pair of horses as they move from owner to owner in the time of WWI. The main protagonist Albert Narracott is a handsome boy who has only one attribute. He loves his horse. He has no interest in anything or anyone else. Nobody considers this peculiar. He is so one-dimensional, he is monumentally boring.Benedict Cumberbatch does an cameo as the eccentric Maj. Jamie Stewart whom I mistook for a Prussian general.But the rest of the people in the movie might as well have been computer generated. They march. They get covered in mud. They shoot. They die. They are like animated tin soldiers.There is smoke, mud, a cast of thousands, explosions and more smoke, more mud, more casts of thousands and more explosions. It is a miserable depressing slog, not something you would submit to voluntarily.The inseparable pair of horses were identified as male early on, then female. Spielberg never lets you get a look to discover the true story. The horses run, leap, rear, drag heavy loads, feign injuries, fall: about everything you could imagine a horse could do. That photography is very good. That would be the main reason to view the movie.",War Horse
105,griffolyon12,A Miraculous Horse,10,26 December 2011,"How does war affect individuals? Civilians caught in the midst of infantry, soldiers embroiled in battle, and the horses that lead the Calvary? War Horse is the story of a horse named Joey, sold into the British Army at the start of World War I. What director Steven Spielberg does is weave a tapestry of war from Joey's point-of-view.Throughout the flick, Joey changes masters multiple times due to the horrors and atrocities of war, the only constant in all of these scenes is Joey, and Spielberg manages to convey what Joey is thinking or feeling through the camera movement and juxtaposition of shots. Through breathtaking scope, solid acting from the rounded cast of character actors, and the exquisitely realized, highly kinetic action sequences that is Spielberg's forte, War Horse gallops across the screen with verve.Where the flick works best is the vignette's of each person that Joey deals with across his journey: from the British boy who raised him, to the British Calvary, to the German Army, all the way to a French farm girl and her grandfather. War Horse is an examination of war and how compassion survives within toughest times. The compassion that the individuals who meet Joey show for the horse, often saving his life, to the compassion between the individuals that Joey meets and how they feel for one another. Ultimately, war is ugly business that those involved are not fighting for their country's victory, but to keep themselves alive as well as those that they love, shown by two German brothers who desert the German Army to ensure that they stay together.Simply put, War Horse is compassion. Throughout all of mankind, one of the most overwhelming bonds that exists is the love of a pet, a dog, a cat, or even a horse. People remember them, love them, treat them as if they're human, and will fight to ensure their safety. Even years later, they hold those animals in their hearts, and are united with others due to compassion that all share for the animals that they once loved or still love.I give War Horse a 10 out of 10!",War Horse
106,asda-man,Lark rise to Horseford,9,29 January 2012,"Steven Spielberg certainly seems to be on form in his ripe old age. The poor chap must be about 120 years old, but his possible dementia certainly hasn't affected his latest eagerly awaited ""War Horse"" which is a graceful cinematic masterpiece. It puzzles me how this film only has a mere 7.3 rating with its incredible cinematography and touching screenplay. ""War Horse"" really is a film that everyone can appreciate. Although their were some small children, probably about 7 or 8 years old who would probably have found it very boring. It's important to note that just because a horse is in it, it isn't a film small children will be able to appreciate. Especially with some of the distressing imagery that some might find inappropriate to put a child through.However, for anyone in the age of double figures ""War Horse"" should be a triumph. It instantly hits hard with its graceful cinematography of the wide, clean, open fields, which is then later contrasted with the wide shots of the battle field where things don't look quite so pretty. If ""War Horse"" should win any Oscars (I want ""The Artist"" to win them all!) then it should definitely win ""Best Cinematography"" with its gorgeous and often breath-taking shots that make this a must see at the cinema. The lighting was also impressive, especially in the final scene with its beautiful golden shading. There's no denying that ""War Horse"" is a visual KFC feast! I was a little bit worried about its lengthy running time of 2hrs 20 minutes because I was afraid of getting a hard arse (the seats at my very local cinema are quite offensive to the buttock) and was also afraid that it might get a bit boring. Fortunately the second part of my worries was not a problem at all. ""War Horse"" galloped along majestically throughout, leaving me never to feel bored as their was always something very meaningful and beautiful going on. I was having a wonderful time anyway and so didn't particularly want it to come to an end! Unfortunately my arse didn't have such a nice time.It's an epic story of a horse starting in the fields with a young man, in a town where everyone talks like someone from ""Lark Rise To Candleford"" who ends up going off to the war and surviving all kinds of violence and distress, and touching people (as well as the audience) along the way. And although sometimes it did seem to dwell on things that weren't that important (such as the 2 German boys running away) it was still enthralling to watch. ""War Horse"" grips you by the reigns and doesn't let go, especially with its emotionally charged scenes that may squeeze out a tear from your precious eye.And although ""War Horse"" doesn't deserve the Oscars as much as ""The Artist"" it is still a masterpiece in its own right. Any film that has you gripped for over 2 hours has to be of some credit. It's a cinematic triumph full of breath-taking directing and cinematography. Combined with a script that can be a little too naive and sentimental at times, but largely entertains and moves. The horse is also an incredible actor, standing out from a slightly undeserving cast. If you get the chance to see ""War Horse"" I strongly urge you to see it at the cinema. It's a beautiful and rare treat that should keep you thorough-bredly entertained.",War Horse
107,cinematic_aficionado,Moving and beautifully made,7,14 January 2012,"""War Horse"" by definition is an unusual sort of story since the main protagonist is, well, a horse. Frankly I could not think of a better craftsman to bring this to the big screen other than Steven Spielberg.For the first few minutes from the opening scene the audience will have no hard time connecting to the film where there is a sequence of beautiful scenes involving the new born horse, despite the absence of human dialogue. The new life is then taken to its first home, in the midst of opposition from the owners' family, and is put to training where it will display its strong personality and make no secret of its dislikes.Shortly after the horse will be separated from its beloved Albert and for the rest of the film the audience is taken on a journey involving the horse, its frequently changing owners and the experience of war. This horse is like no other and regardless of whose hands it falls on, it somehow has the power to transform the human relationships and affect them whereby once is no longer in their possession nothing remains the same. As the story develops, human interaction and dialogue plays undoubtedly a part in moving the story forward but nonetheless we should make no mistake as to distinguish who the most pivotal character is: Joey (the horse). Spielberg deserves top directorial marks for achieving for a non-human to carry the weight of a film.War begins, and the war horse finds itself out of England where at some point it is taken as a war prisoner. Once more this extraordinary creature which in times of peace influenced human relationships, in a time of war it helped bring back humanity to humans. There is a brilliant scene involving a truce form a battle whereby a German and an English soldier work together to help free this extraordinary being from a lock in.The several beautiful scenes, the warmth in performances and its old cinema atmosphere will bring out plenty emotion from the viewers. The rather sticky storytelling does no favours to elevate this achievement of a film to one Spielberg's greatest works. I would expect it to be favoured amongst younger audiences or the more childlike amongst the rest of us.",War Horse
108,billygoat1071,Look Like The Nineties,8,6 March 2012,"Watching War Horse feels like watching a movie from the nineties. It somewhat recaptures the tone with its classic music score and outstanding cinematography. It's one of those films about an animal that has a personality and cared by everyone. It's an obsolete type of film and at some point it's a bit nostalgic. Spielberg still has his great elements in drama films. It's not as powerful as his other dramas but it succeeds to be a great film.The beginning of the movie is the true reminiscence of the nineties. Although, it's a bit sappy. The relationship between Albert and Joey is one of the core of this film but I think the war scenes are more compelling than their love story. Where there's tragedies happen and care for the horse. The film just keeps moving to the horse's journey.The performances were good though. Jeremy Irvine somehow plays a generic kid who loves his pet. But he's good enough. Better when it goes to Tom Hiddleston who has more depth than anyone in the film. The filmmaking is the reason why this film is so great. The cinematography creates a beautiful picture to all scenes. Steven Spielberg uses his trademarks in dramas where emotions and thrills go at the same time.War Horse is great even though it's an obsolete type of film. It's about a horse who gets cared by the people he bumped in to. This is probably better than the animal films we get these days where there are sick sea creatures. War Horses has enough heart to show on screen. Seriously, it's like watching a film from two decades ago and it's not a problem. Spielberg still has his touch in dramas. The cinematography just makes it better.",War Horse

110,dragokin,so sorry about the horse,3,26 December 2015,"It is my impression that with time Steven Spielberg tends to make movies similar to those he enjoyed in his youth. In War Horse we see some nice cinematographic moments which reminded me of the first westerns filmed in color. Also it starts with a Dickens-like situation.The rest, however, will be pure gold for the people of the future, living in the times where the animals would get more rights than today, for example to vote or hold a bank account.I understand War Horse is children's book turned theater play turned movie, but i still can't ignore the fact that we've been looking a a horse's destiny. At the same time millions died for apparently no reason. I mean, if we WWI was a heroic deed, this sacrifice was futile because we've had WWII a couple of decades later.I might be harsh with this movie, because it has a decent script and a and photography that is beautiful at times, but it is my opinion...",War Horse
111,TheSquiss,"If you have children, take them. If you don't, don't bother.",4,16 June 2012,"I know I should love this film but it just didn't work for me. I'm a huge admirer of Spielberg's work and his output is phenomenal but War Horse doesn't rank highly amongst his successes. Don't be too concerned, though, if you already have a ticket. It is far better than his worst (War of the Worlds, The Lost World etc.) but as animal films go, he's a great deal better when using a rubber shark. When the name Spielberg sits above a title, I expect ground-breaking, heart-stopping brilliance. I want Schindler's List, ET or, at the very least Minority Report. Instead I watched the equine version of Free Willy.I look forward to a long film I can immerse myself in and a three hour epic like The Lord of the Rings trilogy is a joyous occasion but War Horse, at a mere two and a half hours, is overlong and had a similar effect on me as the pizza I ate afterwards, which tasted pretty good but was cold. It doesn't matter how good the ingredients are if the overall product that I pay for is substandard.The cast is mostly good. There are warm performances from the likes of Tom Hiddleston and Emily Watson, a cameo from Benedict Cumberbatch that left me wanting more and the presence of Peter Mulan is always a highlight, though he has little more to do in War Horse than look sorrowful and impotent. As you'd expect from Team Spielberg, it is well shot and the children on screen come out of it well.And those are the principal good points. Far less than one would expect from the man Empire readers voted the greatest filmmaker of all time.What really grated was that it was all so obvious. Nothing surprised me. There were no shocks, no surprises and nothing to keep me guessing. It was painting by numbers with film to keep the family happy on their once-a-month family outing. Everything happened too easily and was simply resolved. Even the comedy moment with the wire cutters was obvious and a pointless gimmick as though the director had suddenly doubted he had our attention. His doubts were on the money but the solution was flawed.Even some of the shots were obvious and stagey. The film punctuated with tableaux that were cheesy in Gone With the Wind and are now frankly awful. One such tableau has the family and horse positioned for effect against a sunset and yet they are lit from the front! What is Spielberg playing at? Most unforgivable, though, is the principal (human) character of Albert, played by Jeremy Irvine. If his is a faithful portrayal of the boy from the book, what on earth did the readers find to like about a boy that whinges and sulks, even when he goes to war. And what possessed the director who introduced the world to Henry Thomas, Drew Barrymore and Christian Bale to plonk on screen a boy who would come second in an acting contest with Andie McDowell? I'm sure Spielberg was disappointed when he realized he'd been overlooked by the academy again for best director despite War Horse being nominated as best film, but he has no right to be surprised. Of the six nominations it has garnered, I'll be stunned if it takes a single Oscar. Of course it will make its money back and with half-term looming it will be a family favourite for parents in need of a break, but I can't help thinking it would have worked better with a smaller budget and as a 90 minute BBC adaptation for a rainy Sunday afternoon.After this presentation, Spielberg's report card should read, Capable of so much more. Must do better.Bring on Lincoln and a much-needed return to form! Another film review from The Squiss. For more reviews from The Squiss subscribe to my blog at www.thesquiss.co.uk",War Horse
112,davidgee,Shamelessly schmaltzy but stunning,8,19 January 2012,"Steven Spielberg gives us his most shamelessly sentimental movie since E.T.. But, with sweeping landscapes and stunning battlefield scenes (slightly ""sanitized"" to keep the 12A rating), WARHORSE has much of the majestic feel of a David Lean epic. The early scenes in Devon and at the windmill in France would have benefited from some pruning, and moving the Battle of the Somme from 1916 to the last weeks of the war is a bit of liberty. Some critics have dismissed the film for daring to concentrate on a horse amid the terrible human carnage that was World War One, but the horse was the focus of the original book and play, and Spielberg takes pains to keep his 'performing' horses at the centre of the story.WARHORSE was not written as a companion piece to ALL QUIET ON THE WESTERN FRONT, it's in the tradition of BLACK BEAUTY and NATIONAL VELVET. Yes, it's schmaltzy, almost maudlin, but it makes the point (okay, an obvious one) that war is savage to both men and beasts. Only the most stony-hearted cynic could fail to be moved by this beautifully crafted tale.",War Horse
113,lagudafuad,"a drama true and true, that only if you are cut out for such movies you won't be disappointed.",6,14 January 2012,"I have seen many cool movies and War Horse is one but as for interest and fun while watching that may be on the shaky side.My opinion of this movie is that Spielberg may not have put his all into the movie, having to sit through 2 hrs 15 mins, you start to get bored after going half way, and then the interest starts again towards the end.Based on a children's book of the same name, War Horse has something that catches my attention which is the set.The set, was so well detailed you'll actually believe this is World War 1, the script too has to be given credit as we get to travel on both sides of the battle, feeling joy, pain, loss and tragedy.The story is simple, in Devon (England) a young boy named Albert Narracott (Jeremy Irvine), befriends a horse named Joey. During the War in 1914, Albert's father, Ted (Peter Mullan), sells the animal to the cavalry.What follows are series of fortunate and unfortunate events in which Joey sees the war from nearly every angle. He'll gallop under the noble Captain Nicholls (Tom Hiddleston), haul artillery for the Germans, brighten the days of an orphaned French girl (Celine Buckens) and end up stranded between sides in No Man's Land. Joey reflects the times and peoples that me met during his travels.The movie is what you make of it but you have to be proud of the cinematography, it was a masterpiece if am allowed to say so, the camera angles and some of the shots were so well done you have to dip your hat in appreciation, it was done by Academy Award winner for best cinematographer in Schindler's List and Saving Private Ryan (also Spielberg films) Janusz Kamiński, who works with Spielberg on some of his greats including The Adventures of Tintin.All in all, war horse is a drama true and true, that only if you are cut out for such movies you won't be disappointed.",War Horse
114,LloydBayer,Not his Best. Not his Worst.,7,29 January 2012,"A motion picture can be successful in two ways. Commercial success― through box-office returns and popularity of the masses, or critical success― panned by critics for its excellence and relevance as an art form. Sometimes both ways. Having said that, Steven Spielberg is one of few directors who almost always manages to bridge the gap, or in other words, have viewers from both sides of the fence join hands in unanimous reception of the film. Let me emphasize the words 'almost always', as this film is an exception.Adapted from a bedtime storybook of the same name, this epic tale begins when Albert Narracott (Jeremy Irvine ) has to train a thoroughbred colt he calls Joey, to plough through land rented by his father. With the rent overdue and behind on the harvest, Albert's father sells Joey to Captain Nicholls (Tom Hiddleston), an officer of the British cavalry division, just as World War I is breaking out. Through tragic twists and turns of fate, Joey changes hands (and sides) from the British cavalry to the German army, then to a frail young French girl, then again into the German heavy artillery division, until he is found almost shred to pieces. Meanwhile, Albert has enlisted in the war and although fighting on the frontlines, never gives up hope of being reunited with his horse. As we have seen before, Spielberg is not a director to sugar-coat war movies. However, going in with that expectation will be frivolous for most viewers, as this movie is unlike any other that bears a Spielberg insignia. Although a huge chunk of the plot revolves round the war, it actually focuses on Joey's trail and not detailed battles or intense war sequences. This also explains the juvenile classification of PG-13. In this regard, fans of Saving Private Ryan or any other action junkie may find this movie lacks the standard intensity of a Spielberg release. Instead, what you do find is a high feel-good factor through various facets of the plot. This is kneaded into the story through a perfect blend of tragedy, coincidence and even luck. Some parts of the film are almost a fairytale, but without the magic touches we have come love about this director. The film's heart-warming moments are, without doubt, the rendition of a strong bond between man and his most domesticated yet noble beast. As such, these moments can only be compared to those last seen in that 1979 classic, ""The Black Stallion"".Performances are memorable from Jeremy Irvine in the lead, Emily Watson as Albert's mother and Peter Mullan as his drunk and foolish father. Celine Buckens is a standout as the young French girl Emilie, with some comic moments in the film. Well done for an introductory role. Even with good performance from a huge array of actors, this is thoroughly a director's movie. Sweeping through the English and European countryside, cinematography is not only gorgeous, it hearkens back to old school movies. Production design also gives an epic feel to the story, especially during the wartime periods. For what its worth, this film is no where near his masterpiece, ""Schindler's List"", but it confidently strides towards art instead of pop-corn entertainment. As a critic, I appreciate the finer elements that constitute the making of this movie and the intention behind its making. As a Spielberg fan, I see this veteran in a new light and it amazes me that he is still evolving as a director when there is no need to, given the passion and power put into everything he has made thus far. That said, and with objectivity in the closet, I also feel this is Spielberg doing a movie like a tyrant, inconsiderate of the fence between the two ways this film is received.",War Horse

But with ""War Horse"" I felt Steven Spielberg is back as a director who once brought us 'E.T."" which I believe is one of the iconic movies of all time.'War Horse"" is based on a children's novel where a young lad from England raises a horse which gets sold to the British cavalry during World War I. Then the story emanates through the travel of the horse through different hands till the end of the war when the horse gets trapped in the barbed wire in no man's land. The film is shot in a bit old fashion with the attention given to the vintage details. The horrific shots of the war and the finale are especially the most impressive and show the ingenuity of Spielberg's direction. The shots somehow reminded me of the war scenes and brutality of war from ""All Quiet on the Western Front"" and the evening shots of the finale reminded me of ""Gone with the Wind."" The story is seen through the travel of the horse named Joey and the emotions of the characters that gets along the story just keep you glued for the next two hours. The real beauty of the film lies on the beautiful narration, simplicity, shots, and the sentiments which come vividly on the screen and at instances, the film becomes poignant with deaths and torment every character goes through.

116,kdnor2011,Beautiful and Emortional Film,8,23 February 2012,"Whenever Steven Spielberg releases two films in a year, one of them will usually be a blockbuster simply meant to entertain, and the other will be his ""Oscar"" movie. 1993 we had Jurassic Park and Shindler's List. 2005 had War of the Worlds and Munich, and 2011 had TinTin and this. And pretty much every time I always prefer the blockbuster, and this is the case for here.There isn't really anything wrong with War Horse, it just doesn't have as much rewatch value as Spielberg's blockbusters. And it isn't as strong as something like Shindler's List of the Color Purple. It's a story where we follow the horse, and while the horse is a great character, I feel the movie's human characters aren't as strong. Some of them are really good, some we don't spend enough time with to get invested.It looks great, the direction and cinematography are phenomenal, with great production value. The action scenes are beautifully shot, no shaky cam with plenty of visual flair. The acting is really good, and it can get very emotional at times. It's the relationship between the horse and Albert that carries the film, if you don't believe it, then you probably won't care for this movie. But I did and near the end I was on the verge of tears.War Horse is somewhere in the middle of Steven Spielberg's filmography. It doesn't have the rewatch value of a lot of his blockbusters, nor is it as emotionally investing as some of his other Oscar movies. But it's so well directed, acted and shot with a great chemistry between the horse and the boy that it's still a great film.",War Horse
117,Mike_Devine,More like a WWI era family drama,6,20 June 2021,"The Great War is often overlooked by filmmakers when compared with the flashier World War II. In 'War Horse,' we see a different shade of the story of the original global conflict - one that plays out more like a family drama than a traditional combat-themed action film.Of course, the star of the show is Joey the thoroughbred - an underdog who learns to overcome the odds despite his perceived inferiority compared to other bigger, bulkier workhorses. The bond developed between Joey and a young farmer's son named Albert (Jeremy Irvine) is the central one documented over the course of Steven Spielberg's film, but it's not the only one, as the story unfolds around Joey as things progress and his surroundings change.Aside from having an A-list director at the helm, 'War Horse' benefits from compelling cinematography and a moving soundtrack. We also get to see earlier performances from some of Marvel's finest - Tom Hiddleston and Benedict Cumberbatch - not to mention Emily Watson as a tough, needle-wielding mom who isn't afraid to defend her family.Still, it's not without its problems. 'War Horse' glosses over many of the horrors of WWI, instead making it seem like things were not as bad as they were in reality. It's also somewhat cheesy at parts, which stands out in a bad way considering the serious reality of the film. Basically, it comes off as being schlocky and overproduced.'War Horse' isn't the most memorable story, but it gets points for trying something new given how many times Hollywood has gone back to the ""war well.""",War Horse

119,kgprophet,Warrrr Horrrse - a nice woody title,6,20 January 2012,"This is one of those films where I question how objective I can be when I follow movie-making so closely. By now, it is easy for me to identify the Spielberg 'formula', and the Kaminski shooting 'template'. So walking into the theatre, I expected some Spielberg-isms, and grandiose cinematography. About 80% of the cinematography is beautiful, which surprised me. A good deal of the homestead footage shot on the exterior locations in England are harshly lit, and mismatched angles with multiple shadows that frankly looked like amateur hour. A little shocking when your cinematographer has won two Oscars. Expectations are high as usual for the music by John Williams, and I found it merely perfunctory. His score for Tintin was far more memorable. For horse aficionados, there are the obligatory horse-and-boy bonding moments, with the obligatory triumphant music. But going back to my problem when watching a Spielberg film, I know his touches so well that for the most part the momentum felt mechanical. I felt as though I was watching a Disney children's film. Like Old Yeller. The characters were mostly very simplified, the dialogue spoken at a level appropriate for a 6 year old. Nothing wrong with that, but then the target audience, the young kids, are thrown into battle. Sure, there is no blood or gore, but that only feels like a cheat, especially for the adults in the audience.One thing the film has going for it is a well worn story that can still tug at your heart strings. There is the iconic shot of the boy riding the horse in the sunset that taken out of context is purely stereotypical and feels like a Hallmark moment. But a willing audience member can be engulfed in the emotion of the moment and find some attachment to the material. I was only along for the ride a little over half the time. And yes at one point in the film someone says aloud ""War Horse"", as if Spielberg felt it was obligatory like everything else.",War Horse
120,buckikris,Steven Spielberg Does It Again.,10,23 April 2012,"I rented this movie the other night and I am so glad I did. I love Steven Spielberg, in fact when it comes to directing I think he's a genius. When this movie came out; I thought it would be boring and I honestly didn't want to see it. I was so wrong, it's anything but boring, it's a great story that leaves a great feeling with you at the end of the movie. The story takes place about a year before World War 1 begins. Aman goes to a market to buy a horse for plowing, but buys a thoroughbred instead. As soon as he gets home he hears about it from his wife, telling him the horse is useless and will leave them broke. The son of the family falls in love with the horse and names it, I can't think of the name but my mind is stuck on Petey, and I know it's not it. The boy tells his parents he will train it to plow the fields, but please don't sell it or shoot it. It took him awhile but he knew there is something special about him. As soon as the war begins, the military rounds up all the horses for battle, including his. When he finds out what his dad did, he is very upset and tries to stop it, but it's too late. He does everything to try to keep from getting separated from his friend, he even tried to sign up for military service 2 years early but was denied. The story shows how they were used as in the war effort and how they were worked to death when the Germans caught some of the English soldiers and confiscated the horses. This movie is very moving and yes it does have some sad parts in it, but everyone should see this movie and not just because Spielberg did it. It's a great story about a horse and the bond it has with it's owner and not even The war could separate them. THX, Kris L. CocKayne",War Horse
121,nickmesafilms,War Horse (2011) - Steven Spielberg Has Totally Knocked the Ball Out of the Park!,9,15 January 2012,"Based on both a children's novel and stage adaptation of the same name, ""War Horse"" is one of 2011's most thrilling war dramas, but at it's heart, it's a powerful friendship story between human and animal. The movie is set before and during World War I, where a young man named Albert finds a lost horse, named Joey, and decides to take him in, to help save his family for the loss of their farm. Throughout the years, Albert gives Joey the training, care, and respect he needs. But when his beloved horse is sold to the calvary, Albert enlists into service in WWI, on a hopeful journey to get his best friend back. Director Steven Spielberg brings yet another masterpiece that will join his other great accomplishments. It's no surprise that I'm a huge fan of Steven Spielberg, and he, once again, makes another well-made motion picture. With a fabulous directing duty that will reward him with an Oscar nomination, Spielberg makes a well-made, beautiful friendship story, similar to that of Spielberg's ""E.T."". The whole movie felt like a breath of fresh air, and it's perfectly enjoyable, and it's worth watching. I really enjoyed how this movie combines the classic war genre, with the friendship story formula. The beautiful screenplay by Richard Curtis and Lee Hall is quite unique, the cinematography by Janusz Kaminski is super breathtaking, the editing by Michael Kahn is just perfect, and John Williams created one of the most memorable and excellent music scores ever seen on film. Also, the brilliant cast of Emily Watson, Peter Mullan, Niels Arestrup, David Thewlis, Tom Hiddleston, and Jeremy Irvine, in a unforgettable scene-stealing performance as Albert, really make the movie for what it is. The battle sequences are top-notch, the sense of war is real, the friendship scenes are beautifully touching, and the finale is a perfect heart-warmer for all audiences. Steven Spielberg never disappoints, and delivers one of the best pieces of movie-making ever seen on screen. Out of all the brilliant films that Steven Spielberg has created, ""War Horse"" is truly one of my favorites, and I hope that this movie has a nomination for Best Picture of 2011. ""War Horse"", in my review, ""a beautiful journey of friendship"".",War Horse
122,Ramascreen,Underwhelming,4,21 December 2011,"Beautifully shot, yes! Wonderful story, absolutely! Plus it's a war  movie that you can take your family to, but,.. WAR HORSE is  underwhelming, it gets lost in trying too hard to be a tearjerker so  much so that I hardly feel its emotional power. You can definitely  label WAR HORSE as the feel-good movie of the year, but it's nothing  short of formulaic  I'm a die hard fan of John Williams, what a brilliant composer! And his  music for this film is probably the biggest reason why I was looking  forward to WAR HORSE and it doesn't disappoint. His new music is as  memorable as his previous scores in the past. The film however just  doesn't work for me, even with the gorgeous cinematography by Janusz  Kaminski. The fact that it's made by Spielberg, certainly would still  attract audiences, but just don't expect it to be like Saving Private  Ryan or Empire Of The Sun, because WAR HORSE is not on that same level.  I do admire whatever method the production applied to train the horse  for this film, and I'm sure they used more than just one horse for the  character Joey. There are certain scenes that might make animal lovers  everywhere cringe because of what those scenes required the horse to  seemingly do. In the story, the horse Joey encounters several human  characters, besides Albert, through its unexpected journey and sadly  the film doesn't allow us enough chance to get to deeply know those  human characters There is a point where Joey is so crushed by  excruciating grief that he starts to run like the wind and it even  doesn't care which way it's going, it doesn't care about living and  dying either, and that tells you the film's intention all along, to  make Joey have some kind of human-like personality, this happens when  you deal with movies that have animals as their lead stars, which goes  back to formulaic. So that aspect would resonate with audiences who  love films like Babe. I just feel the film doesn't challenge itself and  it leaves me with an indifferent afterthought.  WAR HORSE has its funny and heartfelt moments, the themes are  empowering and liberating, they exude strength and loyalty, there is no  denying, in addition to a very hopeful ending but it plays it safe and  it's not one of my favorite Spielberg films.",War Horse
123,dvc5159,"A horse with many names, but with only one true friend.",8,8 February 2012,"I remember the first time I saw a horse, it was at a fair at the local race track many years ago, and I was amazed, I won't lie to you. It is a child-like wonder to be amazed and be at awe at a magnificent creature, such speed it gallops by! Such strength it displays!Steven Spielberg's ""War Horse"" reminded me of that day, and more. It is a fictional tale set during WWI, and it is meant for kids and their families to watch and be at awe at this magnificent animal. ""War Horse"" was written by Lee Hall and Richard Curtis based on Michael Morpurgo's children novel - so any expectations of it being as grisly as Spielberg's own ""Saving Private Ryan"" should be removed. Historical fact is dismissed in favor of interesting characters and pure first-rate storytelling.There are many joys to behold in this film. It is first of all a true epic film with a production value of the highest caliber. There are exquisitely detailed sets and production designed locations, with the dirt and grit from the battlefields and the homely, pleasant countryside backdrop and farmhouses. Costumes are designed meticulously and then worn my hundreds of real non-CGI extras for use in said sets. Epic battle sequences with thundering sound effects. Sweeping, lush and simply beautiful cinematography by Janusz Kaminski which captures those memorable emotional moments. Yet another beautiful and excellent music score by the legendary John Williams that stirs the emotions.Yes, there are all trademark Spielberg fare. Yet despite his large reputation, Spielberg is often criticized for manipulating emotions using the very techniques mentioned above. At times it will get distracting but ""War Horse"" makes them work. In fact Spielberg deliberately made this film to be as accessible to children and their families as possible. This is the kind of movie that parents and/or grandparents will take their children/grandchildren to see for a wonderful family outing at the movies, back in the past, of course. ""Lassie"" and ""Old Yeller"" come to mind. I'd say ""War Horse"" is the perfect modern-day companion for those two.Spielberg has assembled a fine and powerful British cast - Peter Mullan, Emily Watson, Tom Hiddleston and David Thewlis... but the heart of the movie belongs to one: Jeremy Irvine, being the young and innocent farm boy who loves his beloved companion. Irvine is perfectly cast in the role and we feel for him as he gets upset over the selling of his friend.Hall and Curtis wisely decided to treat the horse as a character by itself and developed it not just by its own actions but by also its supporting characters. As we are introduced to new characters as the horse ventures from one place to another, the people that encounter him both change him and are changed by him. You will rarely see this type of character development in a mainstream film these days. An exceptional scene is where the horse is stuck in between no man's land on the battlefield, and both a British and a German soldier work together to free the horse, while at the same time breaking the ice between each other. I am instantly reminded of the classic war films of the past where such a moment develops characters on both sides, making them more sympathetic, so it is sad that they have to end it soon and return to their sides to fight against another.There are many references to Spielberg's idols as well. Some of the epic sequences are structured similarly to Akira Kurosawa's epics. The very final scene of the movie, which contains mesmerizing cinematography, echoes that of John Ford. It is nice to see a master paying homage to his own masters.Like many war films of the past, this one contains a common flaw - that is, foreign characters speaking English. Not just the Germans, but a French girl and her grandfather also. I agree that it is distracting and they should speak their native language, but then I remembered that this was meant to be for families and that some children will be hard pressed into reading subtitles for two and a half hours. So I'll let Spielberg off. Besides, I didn't complain about ""Schindler's List"" being in English throughout, but it's just my opinion.And the PG-13 rating? Justified. I am quite surprised to see that there the epic battle sequences contain a startlingly intense and realistic atmosphere throughout, with the exception of gore and blood all over the place. Apart from that and the fact that there are dead bodies seen everywhere in the aftermath (both horses and humans) - everything else stays well within the PG-13 limit. Steven Spielberg has entertained us with his many classics, with ""E.T."" being a quintessential family film. Now he has made another, ""War Horse"", which can be enjoyed by kids with their parents or grandparents along for the ride. This is the kind of vintage Spielberg movie magic that we go to the movies for, to be enthralled and to be entertained. Spielberg has done it again. Great stuff. You are a good parent if you take your kids to see this instead of ""Alvin and the Chipmunks"" or other mindless candy like that.Overall: 83%",War Horse
124,Rockwell_Cronenberg,Everything wrong with Spielberg.,1,8 January 2012,"My hatred for Steven Spielberg has been made no secret by me over the years and when it comes to an example as to why, nothing in his career works as well as War Horse. This is a film loaded to the brim with all of the nauseating cheese and sentimentality that makes me shudder whenever I see his name attached to a film. Almost from the start you can just taste the gooey sweetness pouring off the screen and it never really stops.There are a few moments that tease that maybe there's going to be a little more to it, but those are wiped away quickly. The premise in itself is relatively laughable, as we follow a horse that inexplicably travels through many different sides of the first World War, from the farm where it's born to the front lines of both sides of the battle between the English and French and boy is this just the perfect excuse for us to be riddled with cliché after cliché. Some clichés in films work for a reason; Warrior was loaded with them but the sincerity of it's characters made the emotions feel real for me.Then there are others don't work and here you can find just about every wartime move imaginable; from the cocky leader that's secretly terrified of dying to the young boy who lies about his age in order to enlist, each time our horse encounters a new character we are treated to another dose of this tripe. Hell, there's even a terminally ill little girl for those who don't think the manipulative war clichés are enough. It's Spielberg doing what he does ""best"", throwing on cheese after cheese to a disgusting degree.There's even the dreadfully glossy cinematography from Janusz Kaminski and the hilariously sensational score from John Williams. It's all so superficial and forced, all leading to the final act where every new scene features one revolting move after the next. Two opposing soldiers meet in the middle of No Man's Land to cut the horse loose from wires, a mother and son embrace after the war while the sun sets behind them. Jesus Christ.For fear of spoiling the film for some people who actually think this might give them some sort of quality viewing I won't describe the worst offender of them all, but the climax is one of the most laughably sentimental and ridiculous scenes I've witnessed this year, if not in the history of cinema. It's pathetic. This film is the epitome of everything that makes me loathe Spielberg.Despite everything that's wrong with how Spielberg handles the material, the clichés and sentimentality of it all isn't where the problems begin, and it might not even be where they are at their most substantial. While that was probably my main issue with the film, I honestly found faults in just about everything that was going on here.I do feel that it kind of pours on cliché after cliché in a way that feels forced and manipulative, but I also have a lot of problems with just the artificiality of it all in general. From the way that it's shot to the way the sets are designed, it all felt very staged to me and very much like I was watching a filmed version of the play. For something depicting a war it felt claustrophobic in a lot of ways.I also think that the characters were all clichés themselves, because the writing doesn't give them time to develop into whole human beings before it quickly jumps to another one. I just don't think any of the characters were very well established. Actually, in writing this I'm thinking that a lot of my problems lie more with the writing than with the directing, although I do think there are a lot of moments where things come together in a very sappy and artificial way.",War Horse
125,jackasstrange,Well intentioned but badly crafted film that unfortunately adds nothing but an empty feeling.,6,16 February 2014,"Like almost every Spielberg work, 'War Horse' brings a nostalgic feeling of what used to be the filmmaking before all the 'evolution' we had with technology. And yes, in fact, Spielberg used(and over- used) a well-known formula of bringing success to his films. The same used in the 'old' days, that started with the enormous box-office success 'Gone with the Wind' and a few filmmakers still using them even nowadays(Spielberg among them).War Worse is a dull, empty and emotionally impossible to connect with. The character development is bad, when it happens, I mean, the main characters don't do nothing worth of our care about them. But Spielberg want us to care about them somehow, and even tries to use our human side through an annoying and suggestive John Williams score. Is really veteran stuff here, but I would like to add that people care much less for these things than they used to do like about ten years ago. Character development needs to be at least convincing. And a convincing story with a character that we can care for, isn't asking too much, is it?And the horse...well, the story is about him. But since he does nothing worth of my care about him, I find his presence empty. The scene which he offers himself to carry the canon, saving the other horse, was something that I would expect from a Disney animated film, and not from a supposedly serious one. I am not sure what Spielberg tried to do, but it was totally out of place.The cinematography is cute, though: old-school techniques used in this film,that some may appreciate. I hope. But the film as a whole is just superficial. Empty. You won't lose nothing by skipping this film 6.5/10.",War Horse

127,Chris_Pandolfi,The Tale of the Mighty Steed,8,23 December 2011,"""War Horse"" must have been a tremendous challenge for director Steven Spielberg, as the film is a balancing act between two of his well-established styles, namely overt sentimentalism and horrific depictions of war. On paper, this sounds like a recipe for disaster. On screen, it comes across beautifully. Don't ask me how he made it work, because I have absolutely no idea. All I know is, like Spielberg's own ""E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial,"" this is one of those rare films that can positively and without a hint of facetiousness be described using clichéd terms such as ""crowd pleaser"" and ""tearjerker."" I cannot deny that these are innately manipulative. But then again, that's sort of how stories are. Besides, we obviously enjoy being manipulated to a degree. If we didn't, there would be no reason to go to the movies at all.Based on Michael Morpurgo's 1982 novel and its 2007 stage adaptation, the film takes place in early twentieth-century Europe, mostly during World War I. It begins, however, in the years just prior. The opening scene sets the tone; in the pastures of Devon, England, a mare gives birth to a colt while a teenage boy named Albert Narracott (Jeremy Irvine) watches from a distance in wonderment. A short time later, Albert's father, a shellshocked drunk named Ted (Peter Mullan), purchases the colt at auction. He couldn't really afford it, but his rival bidder was the mean-spirited Lyons (David Thewlis), who just happens to own the farmland Ted and his family have leased. Of course, everyone around Ted thinks he has made a mistake. The horse is spirited and not at all suitable for pulling a plow.Ted's wife, Rose (Emily Watson), is also upset by the purchase, fearing it will ruin the family financially. Albert, on the other hand, immediately bonds with the horse, which he names Joey. He becomes convinced that Joey can be trained to work the fields, which will allow his family to plant their crops and earn enough money to pay their rent, which has already been extended. Although there are a few well written scenes showing Joey proving his worth as a farm animal, this is quickly overshadowed by the outbreak of war, at which point Joey is sold to the cavalry. As he's being led away from the village during an almost jubilant procession, Albert ties his father's army ribbon to Joey's reins and tearfully promises him that, come hell or high water, they will find each other again.And so begins Joey's extraordinary journey as a war horse, one that will carry through the next four years. He will be shipped to France, promoted as the horse for Captain Nicholls of the British Army (Tom Hiddleston), turned into a corpse transporter for the German Army, aid two young German soldiers (David Kross and Leonard Carow) as they attempt to escape, find his way into the home of a sickly French girl (Celine Buckens) and her overprotective grandfather (Niels Arestrup), and finally be captured by the Germans and forced to pull heavy machinery with dozens of other horses. Even with intense sequences of people being shot and stabbed in the heat of battle, this is singlehandedly the most heartbreaking scene of the entire film. These animals are battered, bloody, and exhausted. A few will collapse and instantly get a bullet in the head, adding to the piles of dead horse bodies littering the sides of the road.That some of the film is deeply unpleasant, there can be no argument. But you know Spielberg: Even in the darkest times, there's always a glimmer of hope. And blast it all, isn't that why we love him so much? That he's able to see the good in every situation, and that he believes in happy endings? Spielberg is the kind of filmmaker who has steadfastly retained that childlike sense of wonder and optimism, and there's absolutely nothing wrong with that. In fact, it might even be healthy. Cynical writers and directors have made countless great films, but really, how often do we need to be reminded that life is difficult? I think we're better off being reminded that, in spite of life's harshness, the capacity for happiness exists.On that note, I'm not interested in an argument over how implausible the story is. For a few minutes, I found myself trying to logically analyze a climactic scene in which Joey is freed from a tangled mass of barbed wire; the circumstances, not to mention the opposing ideologies of Joey's saviors, would make such a thing next to impossible. But then I came to my senses – this is a movie that works on the emotions, not the brain. I wouldn't have had it any other way. We tend to be a bit caviler with genre labels like buddy film and love story, which is a shame because, in doing so, they eventually lose their power. ""War Horse"" is the most profound kind of buddy film and love story, and it makes absolutely no difference that one character is human while the other is not. It's a celebration of the bonds we make – and hopefully, of the bonds we share for the rest of our lives.-- Chris Pandolfi (www.atatheaternearyou.net)",War Horse
128,jose-cruz53,Better than one would expect,8,24 October 2012,"I have read several critical reviews of this simple film. It is true that Steven Spielberg, despite having directed many films, some of which were highly successful, was never able to produce a first rate masterpiece, such as Kubrick's 2001, as an example or George Lucas's Star Wars, as another example. Instead, Spielberg managed to produce several superb films, but not quite masterpieces, such as Schindler's list and Raiders of the Lost Ark. This one doesn't attain the same weights as these two films, but still is quite excellent. I guess that a 7.2 is too low a score for this film, it deserved something around 7.5-8.0.The execution and pacing is nothing short of perfect, as with all Spielberg's films. The main problems of this film are the rather clichéd characters and the forced emotionalism, characteristic of his films. However, if one does turn his brain off, he/she will be able to enjoy it.

130,werefox08,A Lesson From Stephen,9,21 February 2013,"It is quite extraordinary the amount of IMDb reviewers who say this is sentimental. It actually IS sentimental..in places. The story here is not only about sentimentality. Thousands of years ago --before the Neanderthals--man domesticated several types of species. Horses, cats and dogs ETC. Now- 3/4 of Western society own at least one dog. Now...just suppose a bad man shot your dog (mans best fiend). Would you feel happy ? Probably not. Then you will know the strong bond between many animals and there owners. I am trying to keep it simple here...but it is far more complex. Anyway, well done Stephen Spielberg for making an emotional and brilliant movie. The young of to-day like those stupid films about Lords and Rings...and silly Potter films. The age of brilliant movies was the 70s (ask Jodie Foster), now we have CGI nonsense. The time was...when the script was all important. Now it is all about phoney ""äction"".

131,Ryan_MYeah,"With the emotional, exceptionally developed, and sometimes funny War Horse, Spielberg's back at the top of his game.",10,26 November 2011,"I finally got to attend an early screening of War Horse, one of my most anticipated movies of the year, and from one of my favorite directors, Steven Spielberg.A horse is born in Devon in the 1910's, and is sold at auction to a farmer by the name of Norracott. The horse is brought to the farm, and is raised and trained by the farmer's son, Albert (Played by newcomer Jeremy Irvine). Albert develops a strong friendship with the horse, and names him Joey. But at the start of World War 1, the Norracott family is forced to lease Joey to the army, Albert promising that the two will be together again. From this point, the story becomes focused on Joey's miraculous journey through the war, as well as the lives he touches, including Emily, a young French girl who lives with her caring grandfather.In all honesty, though a few might find something flawed about War Horse, I would personally have to nit pick to find something I truly didn't like about it. That's just me, but that's my story, and I'm sticking to it.A story like this one, without proper execution, could have easily been a watery mess, but Steven Spielberg is where it all comes down to. Some may find the sentimentality to be a bit forced, but I actually think that Spielberg turns it into something much more genuine. His keen sense of honest emotion is a key driving force to this movie. He easily balances between touching development to Joey's story, exciting war scenes, as well as the occasional humorous sprinkles (A gag involving wire cutters is particularly hilarious). The third act is especially powerful in how it utilizes all of these traits (I even noticed quite a number of people crying during the ending at my screening).Another thing I've always prided Spielberg on (in some films more than others) is how he is able to utilize such a well formed cast, a cast which accomplishes just about everything that is needed of them, even if none of them really stand out amongst each other.And on top of all that emotion and talent, as always, Spielberg has enlisted only the top notch technicians to craft his film. The editing by the legendary Michael Kahn is right on the money. The movie is beautifully shot by DP legend Janusz Kaminski. The costumes by Joanna Johnston and production design by Rick Carter (the latter of 2009's Avatar) are quite lovely, and the beautiful, and sometimes epic score by the great John Williams fits the film perfectly.War Horse won't open in wide release until Christmas Day, but I'll be eagerly urging people to go see it once it finally opens. As far as I'm concerned, there's no way this movie will be leaving my list of my top five favorite movies of the year.**** out of ****",War Horse
132,williampsamuel,A Very Different War Movie,9,6 May 2020,"For his latest production, Stephen Spielberg has chosen to tell the tale of a boy and his horse- and the First World War. Think Black Stallion meets All Quiet on the Western Front. It may seem jarring to put the tender story of the bond between man and animal against the chaos and carnage of trench warfare. But Spielberg has successfully blended these elements to create a film that is heartfelt, charming, and often exciting, if occasionally sappy, with an emotional pull on par with the classic Homeward Bound.The story follows a young thoroughbred, Joey, who is bought by a poor farmer against his better judgment, then raised and trained by his son Albert (Jeremy Irvine). After circumstances force the family to part with Joey, the horse follows a long and strange journey which will take him across Europe, bring him into contact with the best and worst of humanity, and see him serve on both sides of the war. But all the while, Albert has not forgotten his horse, nor has Joey forgotten his master. I doubt that it gives anything away to say that they will meet again.War Horse is very well acted and directed throughout. Peter Mullen and Emily Watson are charming and have delightful chemistry as Albert's hardworking parents, and based on his performance here, I expect to see a lot more of Jeremy Irvine in the coming years. The supporting cast is also solid, with most actors being quite convincing in their roles. And the horses are magnificent. I don't know how many horses were used to play Joey, but all of them are gorgeous and impeccably trained. Despite being a Texan, I must admit I don't have much experience with horses, but I would be glad to own any animal as intelligent, loyal, and resourceful as Joey.Production values are equally stellar. All locations are superbly detailed, whether they be a quaint English farm or the barbed wire and shell hole maze of no-man's land. The photography and sound are first rate, and the explosions and battle scenes are as spectacular as befitting the director of Saving Private Ryan. The first shot of the front lines was especially impressive. The camera pulls upward from the German trench line to reveal a wasteland of wire and craters as far as the eye can see, illuminated by shell bursts and flashes of gunfire. Most serious war movies don't contain visuals on this scale, and to see something like this in a movie that's really about a horse is quite exceptional.One of the film's other major strengths is that there is little to no attempt made to humanize the animal. We never hear what Joey is thinking, either directly or in narration. He doesn't blink or stomp his hoof on cue in response to a question, or gives a laughing whinny when someone tells a joke. Aside from a couple of long glances that seemed a bit purposeful for a horse, the movie doesn't try to give Joey human thoughts or emotions. His natural cunning and charisma are enough to entrance audiences.Another important part of War Horse's success is the emotional pull and sense of investment it creates in the audience. We like and care about the people and horses on the screen, to the point that we feel we have a stake in their outcome. So even a minor conflict like whether Joey and Albert can plow a field creates keen interest. And later, when the events in the film take on life and death importance, you will likely find yourself choking up. I did, and I'm certainly not the most sentimental of movie goers.However, while the film's emotional drama is one of its main strengths, it can also become one of its biggest weaknesses. At times War Horse becomes too sentimental for its own good, and threatens to collapse into the realm of melodrama. And I understand why some critics have complained that it seems rather trivial for the film to focus on a horse when millions of young men are dying, although I would counter that the film does not shy away from the human cost of war.For me, the most serious problem with War Horse is that I simply could not suspend disbelief at one scene late in the film. I find it highly unlikely that by this point in the war the plight of a horse would inspire hardened veterans to take the actions they take, but I concede that this scene was necessary to set up the climax. And I suppose if it is possible for a horse to survive four years in a war where most horses lasted a month or two at most, then perhaps the events that conspire in no-man's land aren't entirely impossible.Despite some real flaws, War Horse is still excellent entertainment for viewers of most ages. It has a compelling story, a talented cast, top notch production values, and a powerful emotional resonance. It is everything you would expect from Steven Spielberg, and it is one of the best movies in theatres this season.",War Horse
133,badajoz-1,Fifties TV Animal Sniffler crossed with So So World War One Mud,6,18 January 2012,"Six is generous for a so so entertaining film that has no real middle (not heart - it has plenty of that!). It is the story of a thoroughbred horse that is bought on a whim to work a farm and gets sold to the Army for World War One. The horse then passes through various hands before returning (with dollops of schmalz) back to his original owner on the Devonshire farm. The book and play presumably set the horse Joey at the centre and the horse talked to the audience. The film as a realistic rather than animated version does not do this and suffers as a result, because it keeps switching awkwardly between the main characters and the horse and their passing intertwining fates. Sentimentality is not kept at bay, but it is not that that kills the film. Turning, or attempting to turn, the story into an epic is what kills it. Witness the warm, bucolic, rural, working class Edwardian golden age on Dartmoor before all hell breaks loose on the Western Front. Cliché ridden to death - that only someone like James Stewart could have rescued. Some of the best work is on the opening bits of WW1, when Spielberg dismisses the clichés of ageing class ridden buffers in charge of the cavalry, and sees professional, young, non-racist,intelligent officers lead their men into the Forest of Death only to be mown down by the technological change wrought by the machine gun - cue interesting image of men on horses riding into the woods to be replaced by only horses riding past the guns! However, after a painful pulling of huge artillery pieces up a slope to fire directly on Ypres, Spielberg goes for the terribly clichéd end battle scene - the Somme. But it is supposed to be 1918. I thought March or May, but no, the month is hidden because we are closing on the Armistice. So British soldiers go into action to be mown down by a lone machine gun, when we are on the brink of victory in a more fluid type of warfare - there should be a creeping barrage and blasted German positions, but no, we get well built German trenches, watery No Mans Land, as if it were still 1916 or 1917. So the myths go on. I could just about take the little armistice in No Mans Land to free Joey from the barbed wire (especially the gag with the wire cutters) but again we have to suffer the Spielbergian literalness, where everything is spelled out in huge capital letters. The end with 'Gone With The Wind' sunsets - 'I'll never be hungry again!' et al - is just the icing on a very over baked cake. Sorry!",War Horse
134,D_Burke,"""War Horse"" Goes Ahead Hell For Leather",9,21 November 2011,"I will admit that I am not a big fan of movies with horses in them. It's not that I hate horses. I don't. I like horses as much as I like dogs, for instance. It's just that stories about horses tend not to interest me as much. If you've read ""Black Beauty"", then you know how stories with horses as the central character go, right?Well, when put into the capable storytelling hands of Steven Spielberg, ""War Horse"" is far more than just a story about a horse. Of course, the similarities to ""Black Beauty"", ""National Velvet"" (1946), ""Seabiscuit"" (2003), and other horse stories are there. However, putting a horse in the middle of World War I and seeing if he'll survive will give you more than just a cute or feel-good story.It starts off like every story about a horse tends to do, with a young horse being deemed unfit for just about anything by skeptical humans. A poor Irish farmhand, Ted Narracott (Peter Mullan), buys the horse at an auction for far more than he can afford not because he believes in its ability, but to spite his landlord Lyons (David Thewlis).Ted's wife Rose (Emily Watson, playing an unusually small role) is mad at him for buying it, but his son Albert (Jeremy Irvine) spends all his time training it, even giving it the name Joey. The neighbors think Joey is not strong enough to plow a field, but as you might expect, he does with Albert's encouragement.Admittedly, this first part of the film is slightly predictable, but its strength is showing how a hard task like plowing a field is not done simply by uttering the phrase ""Never give up"", which Albert fortunately never does. If you're watching it and doubting that the horse can accomplish this arduous task, then its a good scene.The story really picks up, and becomes far less predictable, when Ted sells Joey to an Irish military officer who is on his way to fight in (what we know now as) World War I. From here, the horse goes from battle to battle, and from owner to owner in a variety of ways, some far more gruesome than others.Spielberg fortunately spares this film from being a kid's movie, as movies about horses generally are, by showing the ugliness of war similar to the way he did World War II in ""Saving Private Ryan"" (1998). While that film was rated R and ""War Horse"" is PG-13, Spielberg still manages to make war look gruesome, if not quite as bloody. Especially in the final scenes on the front lines, war looks far from pretty.Yet through all the film's message on war's brutality, what makes ""War Horse"" stand out is its emphasis on the humanization of every person with whom the horse comes in contact. Through a series of events, the horse is taken into the care of people from Ireland, England, Germany, and France. Every person caring for the horse shows their own humanity, and further accentuates the inhumanity of war.The World War I setting is even more important in this case, because horses really have no nationality. If a horse is from Ireland, a German soldier is not so quick to shoot it.While this film has an all European cast and an American director, one major disadvantage lies in the fact that everyone in the movie speaks English through the movie. When German and French people spoke English, it was difficult to distinguish who was what nationality sometimes. It may not have been Spielberg's fault. After all, there's still this misconception in Hollywood that American audiences don't want to read subtitles.Anyone with that myopic viewpoint should see ""Joyeux Noel"" (2003), which also takes place during World War I. It doesn't matter how long you read the bottom of the screen. Try not to be moved by that film.Regardless, ""War Horse"" is a war movie, but it's so much more than that. It's also more than just a horse movie, or a movie about overcoming the odds. It's about how a love of animals and nature can bring down enemy lines with greater impact than bullets and bombs. A scene where an Irish and German soldier work together to free this horse from a barbed wire fence emphasizes this point more than a flowery speech ever could.There are other truly moving scenes in the film that even brought a few tears to my eyes as I watched it. So I guess you could say that I've warmed up to horse films. It may be true, but it's just a good film in general.",War Horse
135,doorsscorpywag,Never mind a Horse you are having a Giraffe Spielberg,1,8 January 2012,True it was made by Hollywood's most cheese laden director BUT..... This film is one of the most nauseating portrayals of the 1st World War ever. A story of a boy and his horse which has magical powers in that after being sold to the Army it can survive 4 years on the Western Front pulling heavy guns after going over to the Germans then with half a ton of barbed wire stuck to it charge across No Man's Land to the very spot the kid who raised him was recovering from a gas attack. Utterly ridiculous. Once again with Spielberg huge amounts of people die but we are supposed to care about Joey the bloody wonder horse. I know it's from a kids book but this truly IS childish rubbish with as much sense of wonder as an episode of Emmerdale Farm. If he had thrown in a German Velociraptor attack or a British Tripod it might have gotten a second star from me but NO! All we got was cheese on top of sentimental schmaltz about some daft horse in the ocean of suffering that was the trenches of WW1.

136,Maleplatypus,"A kind of Lassie, but with a horse",7,27 December 2013,"This is not a movie as good as other ones by Mr. Spielberg. Don't get me wrong here. He knows how to combine movie elements into an experience that brings out emotions (even the cheap ones) form anybody, even the ""toughest guys"". And that is mostly why we consider him a good director. But, this is not one of his best works. Too much Lassie in it. For me, this is a movie for end-of-year-and-such-holidays time, when families usually gather around the TV and watch family movies (with an inevitable happy ending and an occasional tear from the most sentimental individuals). There's no message or moral here and nothing to write home about. Nothing we did not watch more than several times before; only this one had a bigger budget. And Mr. Spielberg's name behind. Everything is so polished, measured, all the details in place and so on. Too much, I must say. No art, though. Nothing like Schindler's list that is. Summary: just another movie. No more, no less. A ""product"". There's obviously some safety in going average when lacking inspiration. Definitely one of the weakest links in Mr. Spielberg's portfolio. Lukewarm, so to say. But nice to watch surrounded by a family.",War Horse

Made according to a famous novel, and the film irresistibly reminds me of Lassie, only here it's a horse, not a dog. As the title of the film itself says, we follow the adventures of a horse, from its birth until the end of the First World War. On this great and incredible journey, through the horse we meet many characters who come into contact with the animal and follow the course of the war. The cast is great, but almost no character gets enough time to get to know him and empathize with him. The horse is the only main character here, and everyone else is a minor. Anyway with the beautiful music we still get some impressive shots.",War Horse
138,asifahsankhan,"Beautiful cinematography, story, and meaningful characters - the trifecta of filmmaking.",9,11 June 2018,"If The Adventures of Tintin harkens back to Spielberg's Raiders for inspiration, one could look for precedents for War Horse in E.T. and Saving Private Ryan. It would be truer, though, to say that in War Horse Spielberg harkens back to an earlier cinematic age, creating something more like a Golden Age Cinema epic than any film I've seen in years, the one other notable example being Baz Luhrmann's Australia.Like Australia, War Horse combines the rugged, sprawling beauty of a classic Western with epic wartime saga. Based on the 1982 children's novel by British author Michael Morpurgo as well as the award-winning 2007 stage play, War Horse is a World War I-era tale about an English farm lad named Albert (Jeremy Irvine) who forms a powerful bond with a Thoroughbred horse named Joey that his erratic father Ted (Peter Mullan) impulsively buys at auction.The family can't afford such a fancy animal, and Joey isn't the right sort of animal for farm labor anyway - but Albert's determination and the horse's heart overcome formidable obstacles, and for awhile the future looks brighter. But then Albert's father is obliged to sell Joey to a British officer heading overseas, and Albert, not yet old enough to volunteer, is parted from his beloved beast.The handling of this episode is typical of one of the aspects of War Horse I most appreciate. When an upper-class British officer takes a poor farm boy's beloved horse, convention dictates that the officer be arrogant, cruel, or at least indifferent to the boy's pain. Instead, this officer is an utterly decent and sensitive chap - one who apologizes to the boy, acknowledges that the horse is worth far more than he's able to pay, and gives his word to give the horse back upon his return if he is able to do so.Although it's probably no spoiler to say that the officer's promise doesn't pan out, he does prove his good intentions by going above and beyond the call of duty to keep the boy apprised of Joey's condition. This is typical of the film's humanism, which extends also to Germans, both officers and young boys in uniform.The first World War was a fairly pointless war, but War Horse honors the way that men on all sides shared a common commitment to the same rules of engagement, and a common humanity deeper than their political and military cross purposes. Not that there isn't brutality and horror too - both toward humans and toward animals - though not necessarily too intensely depicted for children who have reached double digits. Still, War Horse doesn't reduce men, or war, to the lowest common denominator.There is a wonderful scene, reminiscent of the 1914 Christmas truce depicted in Joyeux Noel, in which soldiers on opposite sides must come together for a common humanitarian purpose. What is wonderful about the scene is not only why they come together, but how they interact. Even more moving is a later scene in which a supporting character who has almost as much reason to love Joey as Albert makes a supremely difficult sacrifice, one that costs him in a way even more than Albert giving up Joey.Likewise, I appreciate the loyalty mixed with the fury of Joey's mother Rose (Emily Watson) at her weak, drink-prone husband Ted. Though she rightly blames him for bringing the family to the brink of ruin, she simultaneously defends him to their son, putting her husband's weakness in the context of the horrors he faced in the Boer War, and the strength he has shown in not breaking completely. Rose's response to her husband, when he shamefacedly confesses his fear of the day when she will no longer love him, is one of the most beautiful and terrible things I've ever heard: ""I may hate you more,"" she tells him, ""but I'll never love you less.""For all its gorgeous cinematography and humane themes, War Horse isn't entirely satisfying. The novel told the story from Joey's point of view. A writer can take us inside an animal's head; a live-action film can't do that (except through voiceovers, a risky move). Spielberg doesn't try. Joey is a magnificent, intelligent animal (a little too intelligent at times, as when he comes to the aid of another horse with whom he has bonded), but in the end his liquid gaze is as impenetrable as any animal's. We can feel for him, but he doesn't provide the emotional center that a human protagonist would do.Somehow, though, the sum of the parts are more than the whole. I appreciate the film for its bits and pieces, and for its consummate craft. I appreciate its empathy, its celebration of goodness in all different sorts of people, even in very flawed people. It is a film of a kind we don't see any more, sadly.",War Horse
139,Tcarts76,Much better than I thought.,7,14 September 2012,"I saw previews for this movie and I have to say I really did not want to like it, But I kinda did. The beginning, I started to yawn. The story started to come together too much like one of those corny Disney movies from the 1970's, I seriously almost thought Darby O'Gill and the little people were going to pop out any moment. So right out of the gate I was thinking I was right to be reluctant to like it. As it progressed through WWI, I have to say that the twists really made it become an interesting story. I do think there was a bit of the cheesy moments here and there but not too bad. The only thing that disappointed me was when it came to some of the WWI trench warfare scenes. They were great, but I kept thinking to myself,I wish they would have just made a good WWI movie instead of one about a darn horse but I guess they had to draw in female viewers as well.",War Horse

It will take you through all these emotions. You will fall in love with the horse and love when it loves and cry when it is in pain. A story whereby love conquers all.

141,Fields201,Very Rare Event: I Saw This With My Mother,10,2 January 2012,"I don't go to the movies with my parents very often, especially my mom. The last movie I saw with her was that last Indiana Jones flick and before that was Peter Jackson's King Kong. Problem with movies these days is that it's hard to find a movie that I know both me and that parent would enjoy. Heck, the last movie I saw with my dad was the last Rambo that came out!So thankfully, this was a movie my mom wanted to see and boy did we enjoy it! My mom was crying throughout most of the movie because she was thinking about her friend's horse: Kacy. So I guess this movie is personal with her. The story mainly focuses on the horse's relationship with young Albert, and then the trials and tribulations the horse had to go through during the war. I like how that is the main focus, and not constantly shoving down our throats of this bond between man and animal. In fact, young Albert disappears for most of the story as the horse goes through this journey in the war, showing us the different perspectives of people during the war. I thought the film did a great job putting us in there without the use of 3D. You see, Hollywood, when you give us a good story, we don't need 3D for us to feel like we are there. If we are engrossed in your storytelling and the characters that you give us, we will feel like we are there on our own. Good directing also applies to this fundamental, and Steven Spielberg never lost his touch.There were a few moments that I really, really liked in this film. I liked every moment but there were a few that stood out to me like the scene where the horse was caught in some barbed wire. An American troop braves out from the trenches with the risk of being shot at to help this poor animal, and once he got there, a German is right behind him. Instead of firing on him, they both worked together to get the poor animal out and afterward acknowledging that they would have a hard time shooting each other. It reminded me of the old ""Silent Night, Holy Night"" story when Americans and Germans ate together and because of their bond, they had a hard time fighting each other.It's moments like these that make War Horse such a great film. To the hardship under Professor Lupin in the beginning to the Gone With The Wind-like ending, I couldn't find too much fault with War Horse. It's the best film I've seen in a while, and helped my mom and I reflect on some of the pets we lost in the past. We had a good cry.",War Horse

Hence any details presented, by eliminating my expectations of something as realistic as possible, instead savoring all that are simple yet heartwarming in their own way, I manage to award it 6 stars -- for just being an okay piece of work (there are other movies about animals intended for children but way better than this). The scene of the horse running around in a place where no animal will dare to step foot in is just so fake. Not the best Oscar 2012 choice for me.",War Horse
143,seaview1,The Nobility of WAR HORSE,8,24 February 2012,"The courage of a horse and its bond with a young man amid the horrors of war serves as the backdrop to a saga of loyalty and survival in Warhorse, Steven Spielberg's take on World War I and its effect on a British family. Adapted from a novel and inspired by the stage play of the same name, this is old fashioned filmmaking that could have easily been made 50 years ago back when epic war dramas like Lawrence of Arabia and Dr. Zhivago ruled the screens.A teenage boy, Albert (Jeremy Irvine), and a colt, Joey, form a bond amid the English countryside. Albert's mother (Emily Watson) worries over the house being repossessed as his father (Peter Mullan), an alcoholic and war veteran, struggles to harvest crops from the harsh land. Threatened with eviction, Joey is sold to the army to assist in the fighting in Europe during World War I. Heartbroken, Albert vows to find Joey and be reunited. We can see early on that Joey is a special horse who is smart and brave whether he submits to being a plow horse, outracing a motor car, or lugging German war machines up a mountain. As the years pass from 1914-1918 and the war amasses its destructive toll on men and animals on both sides, Joey's ownership changes hands, but through it all, he finds a succession of kind souls to watch over him. When Albert joins the battle, an unlikely series of events will bring him closer to Joey.Joey is an allegory to slavery as he is being sold as a commodity to hard labor and taken as property by either side in the war. The story is primarily told through his eyes, and each set of people Joey encounters has a personal story: the British officer who makes a promise to bring Joey back to his rightful owner, a young German soldier who dotes protectively over his brother, or a German farm girl who is cared for by her grandfather. In wartime, making friends and losing them is a way of life, and Joey is no different whether it is a human or fellow mare. Some common themes emerge from all these people, namely their affection for Joey and the toll that war exacts on loved ones.Production values are superior especially the vivid cinematography by Janusz Kaminski who employs color schemes especially at the end that emulate the palettes of Gone with the Wind. Irvine is ideally cast as the son who refuses to give up on his horse and friend.There are not a lot of the trademark Spielberg moments that you expect; Clint Eastwood could have been the director without much difference. There are memorable scenes that resonate including a tragic charge by British cavalry on a German position and an auction with an army 'band of brothers' pitching in for a worthy cause. Then there is the harrowing, desperate escape by Joey that culminates in him getting tangled in barbed wire in No Man's Land and help coming from an unlikely source which results in a most unusual standoff. Such scenes may seem clichéd but register nonetheless.The ending does have an emotional payoff, but there are some missed opportunities along the way. There are relationships that could have been developed more like Albert's father who is a one dimensional character but has suffered trauma from a previous war. The possibility of romance for Albert during a race between Joey and a car carrying a pretty girl never develops. Spielberg also meant this as an antiwar film as in the scenes of brutal trench warfare where Albert witnesses his own comrades die, but such scenes are relatively brief and do not linger like his World War II saga, Saving Private Ryan.Warhorse is about the bringing together of a family torn apart by war. It's about the common humanity that unites strangers. It's also about a boy turned man and his love for his horse.",War Horse
144,Come-and-Review,Do not underestimate this.,8,8 September 2015,"When I read through reviews and find ratings such as 1/10 I understand that most of people simply didn't get this movie. I mean, it's not a Christopher Nolan-like complicate movie, I don't mean that people are stupid. More that they feel too smart to understand the meaning of these kind of movies, and get a cold behavior about them. This, just as the legend of 1900 (Another underestimated movie, directed by Giuseppe Tornatore) are part of that branch of movies that I can call ""Modern fables"". They're not meant to be either dark or shocking, or whatever, they're intended to be touching. I cried at the end of both these movies, I won't consider that a sentimentalistic weakness.Every Review I read agreed that this movie had great visuals. I agree with that as well. There's a huge amount of minor cast members like Tom HIdllestone or Benedict Cumberbatch now more popular thanks to other works, but most of the characters appear briefly. The stories that tie in each other help give a realistic historical background in a 360° focusing, ultimately though the chain of events is unrealistic it gave out all the different perspectives we could have about world war one. John Williams' score is at its finest. 'nuff said. Ultimately I suggest to not give your opinion basing off reviews of the film, but by watching yourself the film and judge it basing off your feelings.

Some years ago I found that I had no interest at all in his films. I find his focus on adolescence suspect and I feel his talents are perversely over-rated. Why is he not able to use his alleged talents to tell an honest story about the reality of life, about the beauty of life? Why is he personally trapped in childhood fantasies layered over some of the most detailed and creative violence in film today? There is something not in balance about this Spielberg, something suspicious about his character. The trailer from the film is beautiful, it seemed so interesting...and then it was revealed to be a Spielberg film I lost all interest. I know for all the great photography and staging that it would be yet another story so phony and so contrived, and so I lost interest. A great fantasy contains elements of reality.

147,Kakueke,Refreshing Sentimentality,9,7 April 2012,"""War Horse"" is a wonderful movie. Not too many movies are able to entertain and, at the same time, depict at length the cruel and exploitative mistreatment of animals in war, and it stands out for this. But it is the storyline that is the strongest point. Take it from someone who does not accept sentimentality from typical modern ""character"" movies like ""Godfather II"" or ""Pulp Fiction."" I'm into nice people, not sleazy ones. For me, the sentimentality of ""War Horse"" works, all the way. The viewer is removed from overcomplicated, convoluted movies of the Hollywood of today to a simpler world. In spite of the horrors of the Great War, ""War Horse"" is a movie of optimism and hope. Albert Narracott is a boy who lives in Devon, England, before World War I. His father Ted overpays for a thoroughbred horse to be used as a plough animal, and young Albert becomes close to the horse, ""Joey."" When the crop from a ploughing job is destroyed by the weather, Ted is forced to sell ""Joey"" off to the armed forces, but Albert, who himself later goes into the military, hopes to get Joey back some day.Joey's circle of experiences during WWI are great and terrible. The throwback world of a century ago that is presented still receives, for its war scenes, the modern fast, furious, and overdone treatment characterizing modern action movies. Then there is an exaggerated sequence in which Joey is entangled with barbed wire over a long haul, and dubiously survives. But that is compensated by the beauty of the countryside of northeastern France and the warmth of the characters in the movie. Admittedly, sometimes I got confused with accents as emitted here. Joey's sojourn with a young French girl and her grandfather is touching, but does his not sound like a German rather than French accent? Similarly, Albert's mother seems to have an Irish accent, and their home and some of the surroundings seem to evoke Ireland more than England. But you know it is England with the local folks' support for their country when the war breaks out. What was particularly pleasurable to watch during ""War Horse"" was the depiction of the high level of civility and respect for human feelings, setting aside the general plight of animals in war. For example, there is the sensitivity of War Horse's new owner — Captain Nicholls — toward Albert. He promises to care for the horse and return him after the war to Albert, who so loved the horse. Later, the officer feels compelled to write Albert about how wonderful Joey is looking. Much more transpires before we reach the ending, which is really moving, highly evocative. The wonderfully sympathetic scenes between horse and humans are in stark contrast to the crassness and lack of sensitivity in today's society.""War Horse"" is enjoyable, moving, and visually beautiful in its depiction of the strong bonds that can develop between humans and horses, even during times of turmoil and war.

In a good movie, the actors carry the audience along with the strength of their performances, with a director skilled in using his toolbox. But, in this movie, the plot points are so farfetched that it is alienating. It's as if Spielberg is not only directing the actors, the crew, the horses and the geese, but the paying viewers as well.

150,dharmendrasingh,Brown Beauty,8,23 January 2012,"Spielberg's film is his vision of Michael Morpurgo's beloved book, which must surely now be essential reading for all kids, if it wasn't before.Superficially it's about a horse named Joey and a boy called Albert, who become inseparable through a series of unfortunate events – World War I being one of them. A closer look reveals a story of such overwhelming humanity that I was bowled over. Spielberg was the only director for this film because he knows what it means to be a child.Whether or not it is apparent in the book, there's no doubt this is a war film, one that ranks with Spielberg's 'Saving Private Ryan' and 'Schindler's List'. Emily Watson's character utters a line about the refusal of being proud of killing, which is the line one might use to summarise the film's point. Because Spielberg is Jewish, this line is pregnant with meaning. It's his noble way of saying that, despite the suffering received by his kin, he is willing to forgive their oppressors.There's a scene where Joey is trapped by barbed-wire in no man's land and is freed by the combined effort of an Englishman and a German, who put aside their differences under the name of human decency. The scene is breathtaking, and it's the sort which no-one does better than Spielberg.Long-time collaborator John Williams provides a moving score, regardless of its resemblance to the one he composed for 'Saving Private Ryan'. Director of Photography Janusz Kaminski reminds us of the beauty of our rural regions by photographing the Devonshire countryside with reverence.Jeremy Irvine, Peter Mullan, David Thewlis, Benedict Cumberbatch, Niels Arestrup and Tom Hiddleston form the principal cast and are wonderful.

151,julian-mumford,A very old fashioned English story,6,27 July 2012,"Steven Spielberg has taken Michael Morpurgo's original novel and subsequent stage hit and crafted a thoroughly old fashioned family film.We meet Albert (Irvine), Rose (Watson) and Ted (Mullan) struggling Devonshire tenant farmers just before the First World war. Living in bucolic splendour all is well with the world apart from a lack of income to pay the impatient and thoroughly unpleasant local landlord, Lyons (Thewlis).Ted is a good man but is too friendly with the bottle, leading him to buy a horse at auction, totally unsuited to his needs but allowing him to outbid Lyons, a small but ultimately expensive victory.Albert takes to ""Joey"", training and loving him in equal measure.Misfortune will take Joey away as the world is engulfed in the European conflict, Albert promising to find him again at some future time.The story then follows, not Albert but Joey as he is cast adrift in the maelstrom of wartime Europe. Passing through various ""owners"" good and bad, we see the horrors of the First World war, effectively from the perspective of the horse and his adventures.As a story device, this is somewhat flawed as whilst we can clearly care for our four legged hero, his conversation skills are limited and therefore we can only rely on his interaction with other diverse characters. Certainly it takes a while for the story to progress beyond the early set up.Spielberg has rendered a soft glow on many sequences which even though shot on location have the feeling of a movie set. Music by John Williams is whimsical in many places and geese feature heavily in earlier sequences, adding humour where dread might be more appropriate.Thrills and battle sequences are PG-13 friendly, despite that limitation notable sequences show the directors experience and flourishes. The battle sequence and gallop through the trenches are standouts, this after all is the director that bought us ""Saving Private Ryan"".Peter Mullan and Emily Watson do well with their roles, bearing in mind we see an England that only exists in American Film makers minds. Irvine is rather bland, although to be fair the story is really not about him. Coincidences and improbability pile on top of each other in an uncomfortable way and there is a feeling that film just does not hang together quite as well as it should. More a sequence of chapters or vignettes, rather than a satisfying whole.There are occasions when sentimentality just gets in the way. WW1 opposing trenches clicking and whistling to each other is an awkward sequence, as is the exchange in No-Man's land.However, there are shots that remind us what Spielberg is capable of. Cavalry hiding in a field of crops, waiting for the order to charge, is beautifully rendered. Also providing Benedict Cumberbatch a chance to show off his ""posh voice"".CGI is eschewed wherever possible, this is old school film-making, easily earning the tag of ""they don't make them like this anymore"". Whilst the director is arguably not on top form, mid level Spielberg is still better than most.Summary A very old fashioned English story then, filtered through American eyes with variable results. Technically accomplished as you would expect but not as enjoyable as you might have hoped.Recommended as family fare, though animal lovers should be wary, despite the ""no animals were harmed during the making of this film"" confirmation.http://julesmoviereviews.blogspot.co.nz/",War Horse
152,Gloede_The_Saint,"I was laughing at it, not with it. And no, though it might appear so, it's not a parody.",4,29 January 2012,"If you looked at the poster/tagline/previews and thought to yourself ""this looks absolutely ridiculous"" - just stay away. I can ensure you it's far worse than you think, the fact that you already find what's essentially an inter-species romance to look rather iffy has already proved it isn't for you.The lead is 21, seemingly playing a teenager, at least that's what I hope he's trying to play. In reality he acts like an 8 year old, and not a real one, but one of the caricatured ""cute"" ones we get in classic B-movies and commercials. Googli eyed with the whole ""awwww, can we keep him, can we keep him"" attitude. He has delivered almost every line like he's just about to cry. Like the little kid clinging to his dog, only that the kid looks like a grown man, well the pretty boy version of one anyways.The love between them them just becomes so banal, and beyond preposterous. If I tried to find a logical explanation my language would get quite crude and dirty and I'd probably not be allowed to make another IMDb comment again, so I'll just drop that.Though the lead is obviously the films weakest link he's really not alone. Everyone are beyond caricatured, all sense is thrown out the window and the manipulative music is so in your face and constant that I can hardly find the words. I often found myself laughing, I just couldn't help myself. Seemed like Spielberg was parodying myself. Couldn't believe some of the stuff he actually put into this movie.Luckily the lead disappears after what to me seemed like several hours, and sadly he comes back, but in his absence the movie does pick up a bit. It's still quite poor, and feature a lot of just plain pathetic sequences, but at least the big manchild was gone. Here we actually get some scenes which in some ways work decently enough. Still overly sentimental of course, but slightly less ridiculous.The visuals, on the other hand are quite great. Spielberg is, if anything, a very skilled craftman, so when almost everything else fails he has that fail-safe. I must also say that the animals in this film acted incredibly well, better than any of the humans. However misguided making them act like they were essentially humans was, they did it quite well.I'm not even going to comment on everyone speak English, we're used to it, no big deal. It doesn't help anything, but it was the thing I minded the least. I feel a bit sorry for Spielberg. He plays all the strings, and sometimes the forceful music almost works, but then you remember how dumb what's going on actually is, and it all just falls flat.By far the worst Spielberg I have seen, and I'll never comprehend what people saw in this.",War Horse

7.2 on IMDB.
72% on Metacritic.
94% of google users liked this movie.I passed on this movie many, many times over the years. Finally I watched it today on Netflix.When the story gets to the war part, I noticed how well made the war parts were made and then I checked who had directed this movie, and then it all made sense - Steven Spielberg.The story is beautiful and was written well and depicted well. Who would even come up with a friendship story about a man and a horse during a world war? The ending was great. I would only change two things in this story: 1) to introduce a little bit of romance, even if just at the end, e.g. by making the young girl around the same age as the protagonist and get them both to share the horse; and 2) to have the protagonist show 10x more emotion when it comes to his love and friendship for the horse. The story evoked several emotions from the viewer, but could have evoked way more intense emotions. If my suggestions had been implemented maybe it would have won at last one Oscar (best picture?).The cinematography of the war was great and no complaints from me. Good work Janusz Kaminski. He should have won the Oscar for his great work.This movie was nominated for 6 Oscars and lost to a garbage movie (The Artist); shocking. I have lost faith in the Academy. This movie deserved at least best cinematography and or best picture.Characters - satisfactory but overall totally forgettable performances. Maybe this is another reason why this film failed to win even a single Oscar - because all the actors gave ""decent"" performances which were immediately forgettable. The only memorable performance was by Céline Buckens (the young girl), and maybe by Benedict Cumberbatch (the Major), Niels Arestrup (grandpa), and Emily Watson (mom).Length - this movie is really about 2 1/4 hrs. I appreciated the extra length and made me appreciate and enjoy the movie even more.Conclusion: a Steven Spielberg movie. What else do you need to know that it is a good film? This movie depicts a beautiful story of love and friendship between two species. It has Great War cinematography. Even a pinch of comedy. Satisfactory ending. Definitely a great film to give a chance and I recommend it.10/10",War Horse
154,littlemartinarocena,A Very Pretty Movie,7,26 December 2011,"John Williams score - wall to wall - reminds us this is a Steven Spielberg film. The Spielberg from ""Always"" not the Spielberg from ""Munich"" To say the film is a sentimental boy and horse tale kinds of says it all but, to be honest, not quite all. The battle scenes, WWI this time, are from the same man (men) who gave us those glorious first 45 minutes of ""Saving Private Ryan"" The display of means is staggering. ""Paths Of Glory"" and ""Pride Of The Marines"" came to mind. Our hero, played by Jeremy Irvine, reminded me of young heroes in Disney movies, Tommy Kirk for instance. He's pretty and harmless. But the horse, well the horse is a whole other story. Brilliant performance. I think the Academy should be seriously considering an animal category.

156,bjones,Take a young girl,6,5 January 2012,"I went in knowing what the film was supposed to be about. From the trailers I expected that the film would be an attractive looking production. I tried to have no other expectations, threw on my suspension of disbelief cloak and just allowed the Steven Spielberg film to play itself out.I didn't dislike the film but, at the same time, I didn't love it as much as I hoped I would. On the other hand, some of the others I saw the film with - females - appeared to love it. The film is based on a children's book about a horse (name of Joey); which does explain some of it. It's made in a very emotionally obvious way, seeming to actually reach out, straining to pluck your heart-strings from across the room. The characters were flat and one dimensional, in spite of an impressive cast of familiar faces. The characters seemed to be randomly injected into the story at odd intervals in ways to compliment the horse as it grows to maturity and goes off to join the army; and, oh, for the edification of other reviewers, the horse wasn't ""conscripted"" it was sold into servitude by it's owner to pay for his misdeeds.The characters ran the gamut from the man who originally buys the horse, Peter Mullan as a hard drinking farmer type named Ted Narracott. In rather predictable fashion he is, of course, too addled and intoxicated to do anything of value with the horse he buys as much to spite David Thewlis (as Lyons) as for any other reason. That leaves an important task for his son to tackle. The son is played by Jeremy Irvine as Albert Narracott in a rather unimpressive way. If it weren't for some of the other actors the film would have been a much bigger disappointment. The list of those positives begins with Emily Watson as Rose Narracott, Mullan's wife and Irvine's mother. She was good, but her role seemed to be the dramatic equivalent of a straight-man, injecting necessary lines of dialog to prop up the story; the characterization of Mullan's alcoholism painted as much by her great performance as his.Then there is the always watchable Tom Hiddleston as Captain Nicholls, the man who buys the animal into the service. Next came David Kross as Gunther, a German soldier who tries to do good by the horse but ends up in terminal trouble himself. Next was a kindly but bumbling grandfather; ably played the veteran actor Niels Arestrup, who takes a liking to the horse because his adorable granddaughter, played by Celine Buckens as Emilie.Perhaps the best part of the film was a very impressive scene where the horse escapes from the Nordic side of the battle line but gets himself trapped in the battlefield's no-mans-land. I'll interject at this point that this film is visually stunning, with magnificent work behind the camera by the great Janusz Kaminski.. But he is given a visually rich canvas to witness. The sets and costuming are top notch as is the special effects, so all-important in a war film, and all of that was backed by a great musical score. The production values were so great in those scenes it made me sorry it wasn't a straightforward story involving the first world war.Dragging the story to a place where it was positioned to get the animal back to the simple-minded Albert felt overly contrived. The one bright spot in that segment was Eddie Marsan as Sgt. Fry. He sealed the return of the horse to it's rightful owner, Albert and there were few dry eyes in the audience.I was tempted to say it's a ""chick flick"", but in the end it felt much more like a vehicle aimed at tween girls.By Bruce L.

157,eryui,Well done but obvious.,6,20 January 2012,"Spielberg of course is a great director, and this movie doesn't do exception. It's very well done, in every aspect. But...Spielberg made many great movie and he has accustomed us to some deeper feeling in his works. Often moving, exciting or funny and so on, but it's exactly this that i missed in this one. The emotion. After i have been used to a standard like Schindler's List, Munich, Catch Me If You Can, Minority Report, Empire of the Sun, Indiana Jones, Jurassic Park and so on, before to watch a new movie, I do know i'll see a really well done movie but also i do know i'll feel some deeper emotions. This movie didn't delivered just that to me, a really emotion. I mean there are scenes trying to give you this feeling (overall moving) but in this movie they were clearly forced and predictable; nothing really new and original(a part the main actor - a horse - animals that i do love too).Not less, this movie is watchable of course, overall for a young audience, but from Spielberg i was expecting something with a stronger emotion and less childish (also I can understand he made it for a family target), more original seen his previous works. Not just a single message upon the bravery and love between some animals and men, always using the same assumption, the the ugly of the war. Just, the same of the same, like he did through the eyes of a children in ""The Empire of the Sun"" but at that time it was a new; now we are already accustomed. 6+/10",War Horse
158,JohnLeeT,A Beautiful Film Anchored By An Outstanding Performance by Emily Watson,9,22 October 2013,"This motion picture is excellent and a wonderful story with a great director. With all that said, there is one powerfully moving performance that is truly the centerpiece of the film and which stands out: The incredible work of Emily Watson as the mother, Rose. She is the heart and soul of the movie and it is her ability to draw an audience in to the emotions and feelings of her character that mesmerizes us. The famous director wanted her his film because he knew this would be the case and it is a bit of a shame she was not given more screen time to work her magic. It would have made the film a stronger anti-war statement and enhanced the overall impact of the film. However, the scenes that include Watson certainly capture our hearts and touch our souls in ways that no other actor working today are capable of doing. Often with this actor, no words are needed and her magnificent eyes say more than any dialog could ever convey in a million feet of celluloid. Emily Watson is simply superb and this film serves as another showcase for her stunning artistic gifts and an example of how a single performance of astonishing magnetism and beauty can breathe intimacy and realism into a giant Hollywood production. What a lovely, overwhelming gift this Ms. Emily Watson is to audiences. Her work not only make us experience life in new ways, she puts us in touch with our own feelings in ways we never dreamed possible.",War Horse
159,bdgill12,"Final Two Acts Are Great, First Act Not So Much",7,21 December 2011,"War Horse tells the story of World War I through the experiences of a very special horse. We open with an introduction to Albert Narracott (Jeremy Irvine) and his beloved horse, Joey (worst horse name ever). After Albert's father, Ted (Peter Mullan), foolishly purchases Joey, Albert trains the horse and teaches him to pull a plow despite not being the sort of work horse the family so desperately needs. The two are inseparable until the day comes that Ted is short on the rent and has to sell Joey to a British cavalry officer (Tom Hiddleston) who swears to take care of Joey and bring him back when the war is over. But war is an ugly affair, of course, and soon Joey sets off on a years-long journey that will see him change hands a half-dozen times and come close to death a hundred more while bringing him closer to being reunited with Albert than either man or beast could ever imagine. What I enjoyed most about War Horse is exactly what I would have expected to be my least favorite part: the horse. Spielberg does a magnificent job of creating and honing the film's tone to emphasize the horse properly without allowing that narrative to become tiresome. What I mean is, I think it is very easy in an animal-focused film to focus on said animal so much that it becomes difficult for the audience to relate. Instead, Spielberg uses the horse to shine a light on the lives of the people he comes in contact with and in doing so, allows for more opportunities for the audience to get invested (this works to varying degrees but more on that in a moment). As Joey moves from place to place, we are introduced to a litany of characters, most of whom are caught in some sad state of affairs, and all of whom are impacted in one way or another by the horse. It is a very intriguing and unique concept and one that Spielberg works well within.As War Horse progresses, it gets stronger and hits its stride when Joey comes into the possession of a sickly French girl (Celine Buckens) and her grandfather (Niels Arestrup). Buckens is a real delight and her character plays well to the whimsy of the film's lighter moments, providing one last breath of fresh air before War Horse truly delves into the darkness that is war. But while Joey finds himself in more and more dire situations, the film itself comes together nicely and it seemed to me that at this point, Spielberg found a comfortable groove that is missing in the early goings. In the third act we are treated to a series of scenes that reek of Spielberg in the very best sense of the word and display the true heart of the film. One sequence in particular, in which a British soldier and a German soldier meet on the field between their foxholes to come to Joey's aid, is one that, in my mind, belongs on the Spielberg highlight reel. Indeed, there is an awful lot to like about War Horse in the final two acts.What I did not enjoy about this film was that blasted first act. Early on, it is unclear whether War Horse intends to be a family-friendly, holiday movie or a hard-hitting war drama. In one scene a goose is chasing an unwanted guest through the Narracott's yard and in the next we're hit hard with the sobering reality of life below the poverty line. Later, Spielberg blunts the brutality of war in order to secure a PG-13 rating (which I understand) and then follows that up with the non- explicit but no less depressing execution of two young soldiers. In addition, I didn't care for the shot selection in the first act, a shocking criticism considering I don't believe I have ever questioned Spielberg's work with the camera before. His persistent close-up of the plow as Joey pulls, for example, comes across as cheap and distracting and left me scratching my head. But perhaps the film's biggest issue in the early stages is the performance of Irvine. I wouldn't go so far as to say his portrayal is unwatchable but that terminology wouldn't be too far off. Irvine had very little cinematic experience coming into War Horse and like the film, he gets better as he goes. But if I'm being completely honest, his work in the first act made me cringe more than once. I thought he was terrible.All told, what you have with War Horse is a good film that is being treated as a great film because of its final act. If the audience in my theater is any indication, this is a film that has the power to invoke real emotion, enough to make you forget the lackluster first third. I won't argue that Spielberg didn't know how to blend the family-oriented portions of this film with the harsher realities of war contained in other parts but I would say that he tried too hard to reach out to everyone rather than focusing in on a target audience. A PG family film would have brought a ton of cash and an R-rated serious look at war through the eyes of the horse would have undoubtedly garnered serious award consideration. And hey, it's entirely possible that he'll be able to get both by splitting the difference; that combination just didn't quite work for me.

The German and Allies releasing the horse from the barbed wire and talking about who could own it. The likelihood of Albert and Joey reuniting was too much, especially whilst Albert couldn't see. Also the ribbon making it through the whole war and back to Albert. Too much for me. Made it hard to enjoy. Overall the depiction of WW1 was accurate to what I've learnt - especially the absolute destruction of the British calvary by the machine guns.

162,LilyDaleLady,I'm genuinely sorry I can't recommend or like this one,2,26 December 2011,"For the record, I'm a sappy horse lover, & I desperately wanted to like, nay love, this film but I have to give it two stars. Based on a children's novel by Michael Morpurgo, I never heard of ""War Horse"" until the Broadway production. Magnificent life-size horse puppets were so eerily realistic and moving that THEY actually moved me to tears. This was before I had an inkling that Spielberg had optioned the story and was making a film of it.Spielberg has pulled out every stop here -- the movie is shot on real film and looks it, lush and expensive. The battle scenes are detailed and exciting. There is a skillful cast of respected British actors. But it's entirely without real heart and soul.Without the exciting puppetry (that undoubtedly drew Spielberg to the material as it did me), the only way to save this would have been some kind of thoughtful retelling of the material. And once you get past the swelling music, the golden sunsets and manipulated emotional level, frankly this feels empty. ""The Black Stallion"" -- from 1979 -- is a much more fantastical story, without historical precedent or realism, and yet I never watch it without sobbing like a baby, because it touches something deep and human and universal. ""War Horse"" simply does not. It feels like a calculated bid for an Oscar nomination.Being released along with ""TinTin"" at the same Christmas slot, my impression was that the first big mistake Spielberg made was to go realistic with the story. The play worked because it is NOT realistic. Frankly, I think he should have used animation for the horse story -- made it more symbolic and expressionistic -- and filmed TinTin straight up as an ""Indiana Jones""- type adventure.I was also struck, from almost the start of the film, that Spielberg honestly knows (and cares) NOTHING about horses and that lack of genuine interest plagues the film. The first part of the film, set in an English village, has the Narracott family -- apparently the dumbest and most incompetent tenant farmers in British history -- who irrationally decide to buy a thoroughbred for plowing. Strangely, they seem not to have owned ANY horse prior to this. How did they plow the farm BEFORE Joey? Mr. Narracott spends 30 quid on Joey (I believe this would be about $150 US, as it was valued in 1914) -- that amount of money would have easily bought Joey AND some old plowhorse.And why is Mr. Narracott about 60-65 years old, with a 14 year old son? People married young back then -- Albert is more the age of his grandchild. How on earth did the father think he'd run a good-sized farm, when he's handicapped? and has no plow horse? (Note: nobody apparently had ever heard of mules back then -- much cheaper than a thoroughbred!) Since he spends his life savings on Joey, Mr. Narracott now has NO RENT MONEY....why did he do this? He doesn't even like or WANT the horse! He has no use for such a horse! He's put his entire family in danger of going hungry and/or being evicted for a horse he dislikes. Then he gambles what's left of his future that this slightly built yearling can plow up a huge, rocky field.Of course the horse does so, with considerable anguish and suffering -- in one day, because nobody remotely considered doing it a bit at a time. The Narracotts are so mentally challenged as a FAMILY, none of them consider FIRST going through the field and REMOVING the giant ROCKS, but prefer to make it as hard as possible for the horse. When they amazingly DO NOT KILL the horse with this abusive behavior, it then rains, washing away the entire crop (of turnips, no less). While all this happens, the village folk -- who have no work or farms of their own to run -- stand around IN THE RAIN watching! Literally, they have no more sense than to stand in the rain in their good clothes. Naturally, NOT ONE OF THEM -- all presumably village tenant farmers -- has a spare horse or mule, or even the decency to pitch in and help a CRIPPLED MAN and his 14 year old boy. Nice town. Glad I don't live there. Note: by 1914, if they had CARS, they had TRACTORS.After this segment, there was nothing about the war scenes or Joey's unlikely survival against all odds, that moved me or made me feel anything for the characters. Jeremy Irvine, as Albert (the boy) is especially weak, and he doesn't look 14 (he also looks identical at 18, whereas we all know that boys change VERY rapidly in physique in those 4 years).At the end, when Joey and Albert return from war....well, they apparently take a wrong turn and end up in WYOMING. Because suddenly there are western-like expanses of land, and big golden sunsets and vistas that go on forever. Frankly, it's not Devonshire, England.Among the many subplots -- where Joey is handed along by one unbelievably kind and decent person to another, literally the nicest warring folks in history -- one set in a French farmhouse, with the world's most annoying kid with the world's lamest fake French accent, is a real low point. Later, we hear the little girl has died -- old movie disease, since she looks healthy as, well, a horse -- we just feel relief we don't have to hear her fake French accent again (I was afraid she'd resurface somewhat older, as a romantic partner for Albert).Sorry, I can't buy one frame of this film. A big disappointment. If you do get a chance to view some of the puppetry from the theatrical play, don't miss it -- THAT is magnificent. But the film, just third rate.",War Horse

I can see some appeal for youngsters - they are more prone to having their feelings manipulated.It wasn't till the end of the movie that I checked out all the details and that's when I discovered it was directed by Spielberg. I should have guessed!!! An over sentimental load of rubbish with a totally unrealistic and unbelievable story line. If you are a fan of Spielberg's popular movies then this may appeal to you. Personally I'm not one of his fans - save for the 'B' movie Duel from the early 70's which was unique for its day.I've given this a rating of three - for the acting by the horses and the wonderful cinematography.

 The brutality on the animals towards the last hour or so was so unbearable yet realistic that you can not but clap when it all ends well our protagonist finally meets his friend Joey at the end after series of grueling experiences over a span of few years. Spielberg has never been so emotional in war movies thus far and you actually love the emotions.It is perhaps an emotional roller coaster of two and half hours through different countries, different stages of the war and differential treatments to the animals.
 The cinematography is brilliant.The same is about the actors.But the real show stopper is the brown beauty- the Horse Joey.You will definitely be a better human being after finishing this movie.Go and watch it if you have not yet done so.Another treasure in the famous trove of Master Spielberg.",War Horse
166,fred-houpt,Mediocre and mostly improbable horse tale,5,2 January 2012,"I quite enjoy most of Spielberg's films. From the trailers I had moderate expectations that he would deliver good entertainment value, which is why we go to the cinema in the first place. I am not familiar with the novel that this film is based on and know nothing of the play version. I know a few facts about WW1. The operative word that kept going through my mind in the film was ""improbable"". It is a given that at some point in most films you are requested to surrender your belief that the images are realistic representations of some story. In this case WW1 is a fairly well known event so if you place your drama in the midst of it you had better get it right.The drama begins in Devon just before the war, where an impoverished and semi drunken farmer bids an enormous amount of money for a horse that would be put to use behind a plow. While most level headed men would have purchased a stocky draft animal that was well suited to hauling a plow over rough terrain, this farmer inexplicably buys a horse far beyond his purse and his choice is a thoroughbred, unbroken racing horse. His young son has had eyes on this horse for several years, don't you know and throws his body into saving the horse from his fathers wrath. Eventually his father has to sell the horse to pay for the rent on the farm. The horse is bought up by the British Army and is shipped off to France and Belgium to help in the war effort. The young lad is too young to go fight in the war just yet but don't you know that he'll be there just as soon as he possibly can. And in the back of his mind he is hoping against all odds to find his horse. And at the end of the film, again against the highest of all odds he finds his horse. A more impossibly silly story in Spielberg's output is rarely found. The horse is taken over by several different people who for short periods of time take care of it. In the midst of the carnage of a full scale front line bombardment it survives being entwined in layers of barbed wire, while a plucky and perhaps insane British soldier decides to wander out under cover of a white flag to try and relieve the horse of it's sufferings. Don't you know that the horse is down closer to the German lines and a brave and perhaps equally foolish German soldier wanders out to watch what the British soldier is going to do with the horse. At this point, I'd have to say that it's all down hill and into a Disney-like wrap up.The battle scenes are very loud (I had to plug my ears) but there is very little gratuitous blood and gore, that lots of his films are rich with. No head exploding, blood flying everywhere like in Saving Private Ryan. This seems to have been toned down for a younger audience appeal, maybe? The problems with the film are obvious. The first 2/3's of the film are slow, ponderous, quiet, overly dramatic but without any direction to a climax. The war is depicted for what it was, horrific and led by supremely inept leadership on both sides. This is really a side bar, because this is a horse movie. That we watch British Cavalry ride off with sabres flashing, as if they were fighting Napoleon, only to be mowed down in a slaughtering hail of bullets from machine guns, is really the only major display of insanity that the witless leadership brought down on themselves. That they fought trench war fare and were killed or maimed by gas is given just a passing glance. The war in this film is a distraction and at the point where it looms large on the screen you've forgotten exactly where this film was supposed to be going. Oh yes, the horse.A quick glance at Wikipedia tells me that at least 480,000 horses died on the British side alone. That this film wants us to zoom in on the travails of just one of them in the midst of maybe a million others, is far fetched and a stretch too far. Would we be as swept up in the glorious drama (these are words used by other reviewers) if some heart broken bloke had his dog overseas and in the trenches and somehow he finds it in the middle of hell? It is preposterous. This part of the film reminds me of two other occasions where a major Hollywood film puts men at risk of the trenches with someone trying to keep a sharp eye open for a close friend or relative, the premise being that they've given a promise to someone back home that they'd bring them back alive. It was covered in ""Legends of the fall"" where the brother dies and it is covered in ""Passchendaele"" where the main lead gets himself killed. Those were more believable front line stories than War Horse.I found the dialogue unmoving, the visual images overly beautiful, the plot predictable in the midst of a muddy sea of improbabilities. And for God's sake, Spielberg has the German soldiers speaking English but as they are led away in a march, the officer leading them away counts off in German. Give me a break. Consistency be damned. The music was predictable John Williams fare. All in all I was let down and found the first 2/3's of the film tedious and too slow. I would hardly use the words ""stunning"", ""enthralling"", or ""exceptional"". Surprising let down from a real master.",War Horse

169,DJRMewzique,Another monumental Spielberg accomplishment.,9,3 January 2012,"I knew I was in trouble when the horse began to successfully plough a field and I began to tear up.""War Horse,"" the latest offering from cinematic genius Steven Spielberg, and a Golden Globe nominee for Best Drama, may seem like an act of tedium in theory....it's a two and a half hour movie about a horse...but the end result with stay with you long after the credit role.Basically a collection of vignettes showing the horrors of war through the eyes of a horse, ""War Horse,"" based on the 1982 book by Michael Morpurgo and Nick Stafford's 2007 UK stage adaptation, is also about the basic love between a boy and his steed. Newcomer Jeremy Irvine, a young stud himself, takes on the role of Albert Narracott, a boy who raises a young horse to save his father's reputation and farm before desperation leads the horse to be sold to the British Army at the onset of World War I, never to be forgotten by the young Albert who vows to one day bring the horse home.Through excellent performances all around by an extraordinarily diverse cast including Oscar-nominated Emily Watson (""Hilary and Jackie,"" ""Breaking the Waves""), Niels Arestrup (""Diving Bell and the Butterfly""), Tom Hiddleston (""Thor""), Benedict Cumberbatch (""Sherlock"") and David Kross (""The Reader""), the real star of this film is the horse himself. A magnificent animal who, through all the hardships and torture of war, perseveres to bring humanity amidst destruction.Yes, the film runs a little long and yes, there are elements that are hardly a work of brilliance in the way they are brought full circle, but these details hardly detract from the extraordinary journey of a magnificent stallion and the touching emotion of the love of a boy and his horse.Yep, I knew I was in trouble when the horse began to successfully plough a field and I began to tear up...as I knew I better keep the tissues handy.",War Horse
170,joncha,A children's movie,6,20 August 2020,"This movie has the simplicity of an After School Special on TV. Despite the marketing campaign that implied a blood-and-guts action drama, it is really a children's movie, based on a novel for young readers. Like all youth-and-special friend horse stories, there is an exaggerated closeness of communication between human and animal, and an incredible series of circumstances that reunite youth and horse at the conclusion. The First World War is portrayed in all its patriotic fervor but without a lot of bloodshed or enmity between the opposing armies. Both German and British troops have young men who are horse-lovers and others who couldn't care less about the well-being of the animals. The battle scenes are bloodless but still provide enough of the horrors of trench warfare for a young viewer to get the message.",War Horse
171,DunkelheitVZ,Beautiful sunsets don't make a good movie,5,15 June 2013,"This movie is a puzzle made of stories, all held together by one horse. There is no character development at all, because with the exception of the boy, no one is on screen for longer than 20 minutes. The film should be sticked in Wikipedia as an example of cliché. The music is cliché, you know how the story will end, you know how all the little stories end. Most of the movie is unbelievable. Maybe a 10 year old could enjoy the movie or someone who really loves horses like their own children. Other than that, you can have a look at the movie on a rainy day, but it won't stick. Perhaps you can sell it as an homage to the beginning of animal movies, but I won't buy it. I won't ever have a look at this movie a second time. Watching beg, this movie even raises the question: How many good movies did Spielberg really make lately?",War Horse
172,MRavenwood,"Too ""Lassie"" for Adults; Too ""Platoon"" for Kids.",5,16 December 2011,"The first half hour of War Horse is so golly-gee and baby-ish that it's silly. It turns into a different film in Act II, but doesn't improve. The director daftly chose to present a very violent war with men slashed with sabers, blown to bits, burned with mustard gas, and mowed down like grass by the terrible Maxim guns, but no blood. It's so P.C. to eliminate the blood, but the violence is really loud and violent, so I don't get who wins? The story very predictably plods along with this ""miraculous"" horse being relayed from one loving caretaker to another. Emotionally, they do ""get you"" with some great tear-jerker scenes, but I just can't figure out how they are going to market this. What age of kid wants to see a depressing movie about a boy losing his horse? What adult wants to see a predictable, kid-like horse movie with no mojo to it? Animal lovers, especially horse owners may have a hard time with a few scenes, but don't worry! A scene where a live, but injured horse is crushed by a tank is ... not shown. Huh? that's right. It's edited out. The scene makes no sense, but at least it's P.C. If you want to watch a brilliant horse movie, see Secretariat instead. I guess your mileage may vary, but I wanted to warn people that this must not be thought of as family fare for smaller kids. Too violent, long, and emotionally intense for young viewers. I wouldn't watch it again nor recommend it.",War Horse
173,Mobithailand,Rather corny - especially the Germans and French speak English in phony accents.,6,22 April 2016,"'War Horse' is directed by no lesser personage than the great Steven Spielberg. I had read much about this movie prior to watching it, most of which was very positive. There were those who criticised the movie for being a bit too much of a 'cheesy' tearjerker, deliberately playing on the emotions of the audience, but that sounded fine by me as there's nothing I like better than a good cry! Now don't get me wrong – War Horse is a good movie and by and large, I enjoyed watching it, but I did feel a little letdown, considering all the hype and the pedigree of its director. Frankly, it was rather corny. The film follows the fortunes of a horse, from its early days in Devon to the battlefields of France, but it wasn't the story matter that I found corny; it was the way that story was told that to me, was full of stereotypes, hackneyed clichés and dialogue that went out decades ago. It was bad enough with the stereotypes down in the west country – from evil landowner, to crippled, alcoholic father, to long suffering wife and mother, to introverted horse-loving son, to unsympathetic, mocking friends and, of course, to the brave and oh so valiant horse, who continually surmounts the insurmountable to save his skin. I'm afraid it got even worse in the French battlefields. Whether they were British 'Tommys' - you know the type -'salt of the earth', ""Dick Van Dykish"" rank and file, cockney 'cannon fodder'; or whether they were 'hooray henry' officers, one an' all were all teeth-jarring stereotypes. But at least they spoke their own language. As the story progresses, our equine hero is captured and put work by the evil enemy 'Hun', lo and behold we are astonished to find that every member of the German army speaks perfect English – albeit some of them had painfully trite German accents. Similarly, the poor, suffering French Grandfather and his cute, starving, horse-loving granddaughter, (shades of Dicken's 'Old Curiosity Shop'), who both spoke English with such broad French accents that I could hardly understand a word they were saying. (Also shades of ""'Allo 'Allo"" for my British readers). I thought that this business of having 'the enemy' speak English in war movies went out in the 1970's. Excellent war movies such as 'The Longest Day' and 'From Here to Eternity' used subtitles to make the Germans and Japanese credible people, rather than foreign stereotypes. Does Mr Spielberg think that the standard of literacy has fallen to such an extent that he can't trust his audiences to read English subtitles?Overall, it was quite an enjoyable romp, but to the extent that it also had pretensions to be a serious commentary on the horrors of the 2nd World War, I'm afraid to this reviewer, it fell woefully short. Sure, some of the battle scenes were horrifyingly realistic and spectacular, and some of the special effects with the horse were riveting – especially when the poor thing was entrapped from head to foot in barbed wire – but overall, I have to say I was a bit disappointed. Mind you, it did succeed in extracting a tear or so from me in the closing, weepy scenes.I can understand why The War Horse would make a thoroughly enjoyable book, and I can even imagine it being a great stage musical – which I understand it is. But to this reviewer, the celluloid version somehow lacked that 'special something' that is essential in a great movie.",War Horse
174,kaaber-2,I was led to expect sentimental -,8,30 April 2012,"and I got it too, in spades, but somehow I didn't mind at all. This picture-perfect epic of Spielberg's managed to reconnect me with that pristine film & story-telling experience of my childhood when all critical defences were down. I swallowed ""War Horse"" hook, line and sinker, and I'm not in the least ashamed of it.As for the story-telling, I've always been fascinated by (I think they're called) portmanteau films in which an object connects various human destinies in a slice-of-life manner. I can vaguely recall ""tales of Manhattan"" where a dress coat connects some four or five tragedies, a German film (of which the title escapes me) where it's a Volkswagen, a Danish film (Eight Chords) in which it's a gramophone record, and Ophul's French ""Un Carnet du bal"" in which it's a dance card.In ""War Horse"", Joey does the trick. And I'm not even tremendously fond of horses, but I'm always susceptible to World War I stories. Moreover, I was elated to find the excellent Danish actor Nicolas Bro cast as a German groom.There's also a special irony in my response to this film; up till now, I've tended to think that Spielberg would be better if he more strictly refrained from sloppy sentiment, for which reason my favourite Spielberg is ""Empire of the Sun"" which avoids the usual maudlin moments from Spielberg (and also ""Schindler's List"" which steers clear of sentiment until the last twenty minutes and then goes all in. And along comes ""War Horse"" and completely captivates me. Only goes to show.The only reason I've only given it 8 stars is because I missed the first 40 minutes.",War Horse
175,FilmFanatic03,Are you serious?,6,18 February 2012,"First of all, I want to acknowledge the amazing job done with the technical side of the film. The whole look was polished and beautiful. The scenery and even the war settings were amazing to look at. Also the horse was amazing, I loved it and he definitely steals the show (even though Joey is a stupid name for a horse) However, did the film move me? no. I found it so hard to believe that after four years Albert would still care about trying to find the horse, there is a war to fight and all he can think about is his childhood horse? I know it's based on a children's book but the film seemed to try to ""grow it up"" but even so I don't understand how this is entertaining for children. Also the film focuses about 60% on the horse and only 40% on the boy, but because the focus is mainly on a character who can't talk you focus on the people he is with and they are mainly bland and also he encounters many people so you don't get a chance to know them. It seemed quite rushed and I think it would have been more interesting if they followed Albert more. The film should have either been just about the horse and the boy on the farm and how their relationship goes or more about the action and the war. It was like two rushed films in one. It was close to perfection, and it has potential, but at the end of the day...the characters weren't that interesting to care about and the over enthusiasm of Albert over his horse (during the war) was unrealistic in my opinion. This is a great afternoon film when there is nothing to do, but not a cinematic motion picture. Are they serious that a war film can be a soldier who instead should be focusing on fighting for his country he instead long for a horse who realistically may have forgotten about him? I'm quite disappointed in Spielberg, where was the suspense and excitement that he injected into ""Jaws"" or ""Raisers of the Lost Ark""? It wasn't a bad film at all, just bland. I may enjoy it on an afternoon in, but not enough to rave about it.",War Horse

177,skullislandsurferdotcom,A Horse and His Boy... And Girl,4,26 December 2011,"In 1979's THE BLACK STALLION, it took only the first glance by a kid and a horse to build a connection that would carry through the entire film. That kind of emotional synergy is not only lacking in this old school epic directed by Steven Spielberg, but is practically nonexistent.We begin with a horse that, after being auctioned and sold to a poor farmer who spent more than it's worth, is tamed by his son to plow the fields: even though it's not built for this kind of work. Spielberg spends too much attention on the dusky skyline, the searing soundtrack, and the gorgeous scenery that the characters seem like props in the background.When World War I breaks out, the horse is sold – along with a black horse that seems its counterpart – and we're handed off to a new owner: a young British soldier equally entranced as the father and son. The battles scenes are filmed wonderfully, the camera rolling with the action as bombs blast like they're right behind us – but once again, the characters get lost in the visual spectacle.But it's when the horses find harbor in a small French farm, hidden by a wise old man (Niels Arestrup) and his beautiful granddaughter (Celine Buckens), that the only real connection occurs. In one suspenseful scene, the girl hides the mares as German officers arrive to take what they need, and we finally have a human story.Meanwhile, the farmer's son, and supposedly the main protagonist, is thrown back into the movie as a soldier in the front lines And although his battle scenes are somewhat intense, where's the plot we paid for? If this were about the young girl and the creature she risked her life to protect, it would have been a much better, more meaningful film.Yet the main problem is the horse itself – although being an extremely talented ""actor,"" as a character with so many captivated owners, the relationship with its original family means very little by the end.For More Reviews: www.cultfilmfreaks.com",War Horse

179,miss_lady_ice-853-608700,A Good Example of Hollywood's Destruction,5,8 March 2012,"First of all, I'd like to say that the stage adaptation of the novel, which this is partly based on, is nothing like this schmaltz. Perhaps the novel is schmaltzy, I haven't read it, but PLEASE don't be put off seeing the stage version because of this simplistic rendering.The way Hollywood makes films, you'd think that the population of America all had the sensibilities of a small child. I am sure there are many Americans who must feel patronised by films like this. War Horse received a 12A here but the film was clearly designed for kiddies.The Devon village is like some yucky bucolic. No-one actually has a convincing Devon accent,although the father is probably most convincing out of the ""residents"". Albert (Jeremy Irvine) looks like he's at the farm on a photo shoot. It all looks like a bunch of Londoners who have never been to the West Country. Notably they keep having to mention it's Devon, as you'll probably have forgotten.In the play, the father is a drunk who enters the auction for Joey because he's trying to out-do his brother. In this film, it's because he wants to bet against his landlord. Why would anyone think that was a good idea?! The father comes across as a village idiot rather than a thoughtless drunk as he is in the play. Oh, and in this film he's a war hero and he only drinks to rid himself of the pain! Really subtle! What was so good about the play was that it was unsentimental. The horse changes owner many times, journeying through the war and somehow surviving. In the play,you genuinely fear for the horse's safety. In this film, he's Super Horse, charging round the battlefields to a background of exploding grenades.Also, for those who complained that the French and German characters are speaking English, in the play they speak their native language. They are also portrayed without mawkish sentiment and stereotyping. I am sick of the Jolly Good German stereotype.However, in a 140 minute film, there are bound to be some saving graces. The grandfather (Niels Arstrup) is written as a stereotypical cuddly grandad but Arstrup manages to give him some dignity and provides some moving scenes.What about Benedict Cumberbatch and Tom Hiddleston, the only actors you might have heard of? Hiddleston is good in his part but the part is very small. Cumberbatch is barely there at all, whereas in the play he pops up quite a lot. Anybody who is seeing the film purely for these actors will be disappointed at their short screen time.Spielberg shows zero understanding of the story- he should have left it to Britain. The horse is quite cute and well-trained but he's not a star.I wondered who wrote the script, seeing as it was so disgustingly mawkish. Screenplay was of course by Richard Curtis, which explains everything. You'd think this film was a Nicholas Sparks novel from the screenplay.Although it is fun to watch the horse leaping about, the film is intermittently entertaining rather than powerfully emotive as it is on stage.",War Horse
180,TroyeEvans,"Spielberg Still Stands - ""War Horse"" Among the Best of the Year",7,8 January 2012,"I must admit that Spielberg has playing some of his old tricks again in ""War Horse"", but after all these years they still work like a charm and a wonderful motion picture is the outcome. This will be another Spielberg classic to remember in years to come.Back in old days of ""Saving Private Ryan"", it was Tom Hanks saving Private Ryan. This time it is a horse. ""War Horse"" tells the story of a destined encounter, and a later breathtaking journey across beautifully displayed landscapes. It is a story about the bravery of a young man who embarks on an odyssey to look for his lost horse.This is indeed a war movie, and is definitely one of the greatest and most memorable ones I have seen about War World I (since most films go for WWII). But it is not only about the raging war of course. You'd expect more than that from one of the all-time favorite directors. And I can ensure you ""War Horse"" does not disappoint. It may not be as touching and tears-generating as the good old ""ET"" and ""Saving Private Ryan"", but it is certainly an excellent addition to Spielberg's career.Aside from the story, the cinematography is incredible, and it has to be one of the best of the year. The score is also surprisingly good. I was pretty worried that this would somehow get ""snubbed"" by the Academy with all the strong frontrunners going on right now but I am quite affirmative now that this has the potential and chances to grab a number of nods.Go watch ""War Horse"" if you've always enjoyed Spielberg's movies.

This is not a story told from the horse's perspective as in the classic story ""Black Beauty,"" but simply a boring story that follows a horse through the war. It's a road trip, with the horse moving from one ""owner"" or handler to the other. None of the people the horse encounters are interesting or on screen long enough for us to care about them. If we're supposed to care about the horse, then have the horse narrate the film to show us what he's feeling. I honestly couldn't believe how boring this movie was.

This film fell into that crevasse at times but manages to climb (most of the way) back out. Joey (the warhorse himself) is separated from his human friend Albert and sold to a soldier in the British army at the start of WWI. Joey traverses the battlefield on both sides of the fight, spending time as a german mount, and eventually back as a British one. He is saved from constant danger by his ingenuity and skill, the kindness of a few humans, and his horse friend, Topthorn. When both horses are in the hands of the germans, they are put to work dragging tanks up steep hills. Topthorn has a bad leg, and Joey offers himself for the labor, to spare the other horse. This moment rang false to me. I can accept a friendship between horses and humans, the intelligence of a well-bred horse, and the loyalty of Joey to Albert. However, a moment of altruism from the horse feels hollow and deeply unrealistic, and staggers away from any compelling emotional integrity.",War Horse
183,georgep53,"Idealism v Horror in ""War Horse""",7,4 February 2012,"""War Horse"" is the kind of film that used to be a staple of Hollywood: inspirational, larger-than-life and reaffirming of home and hearth. Given Steven Spielberg's penchant for grandiose themes it isn't hard to see the appeal of Michael Murpurgo's World War I novel in which the tumultuous events of that tragic era are seen through the eyes of a ""miracle"" horse named Joey who bewitches nearly everyone he encounters. It's a marvelous film to watch for its visual splendor, John Williams' score and the fine performances of the ensemble cast headed by Jeremy Irvine as a boy, Albert, who is the first to be captivated by a foal he encounters in the English countryside. Emily Watson is very good as Albert's mother Rose who doesn't think Joey is a suitable animal for the hard, grinding, physical labor required of life on their poor family farm. Albert's father, Ted, nicely played by Peter Mullan, drinks too much and is haunted by memories of his experiences in the Boer War. Niels Arestrup is good as the grandfather of a young, frail girl who discovers Joey in a barn when the story shifts to wartime France. She longs to ride Joey despite her grandfathers' reservations. Arestrup had a very similar role in 2011's ""Sarah's Key"" as a protector of a young Jewish girl fleeing Nazi persecution. Before I saw ""War Horse"" I was unaware of the staggering number of horses that died during the First World War. Given the scale of the human tragedy from that war it was easy to reduce to a historical footnote the impact on animals who were drafted into the service of the relentless, pitiless war machines employed by both sides. ""War Horse"" is good storytelling and familiar territory for Spielberg with its young idealist trying to come to terms with an adult world that seems hell bent on self-destruction.",War Horse
184,BJBatimdb,Snore Horse,2,3 February 2012,"That's it. Steven Spielberg needs to stop making movies RIGHT NOW before we all forget how ET and Jaws and Close Encounters shaped a generation of young film fans in a GOOD way.War Horse is the most tired, clichéd, derivative, predictable, laughable, emotionally-empty piece of film-making I have seen in a very very long time.It's National Velvet without the great script but with a Grand National that lasts for four years; it's Gone With the Wind without Scarlett O'Hara or Rhett Butler; it's Driving Miss Daisy without the gritty realism.Like poor George Lucas, Steven Spielberg is apparently too famous now for anyone he works with to him to tell him when he's wasting money on set pieces and scenery, instead of spending it on character development and emotional truth.I don't object to a bit of emotional manipulation and certainly expected to have my tear-ducts mined. Things started well when I found that during a very short hiatus from my nearest cinema, ticket prices had gone up to almost £9. Lucky I'd taken plenty of tissues, in anticipation of a marvellous cry. I got one out as soon as the film started, just to be on the safe side. But it stayed dry. I didn't even snivel.And the reason was that I felt utterly detached from the story and the characters. Of course, Spielberg plucks furiously at every heart-string like an irritating toddler on a forbidden guitar. The result is a tuneless cacophony of increasingly desperate appeals for emotion, which only made me dig in my mulish heels.The horses were outstanding, and horses normally guarantee a good old weep from me just for being so Ahhhh, let alone being injured, maltreated and gunned down. But I was so annoyed by the film that I couldn't even shed a decent tear! What a swizz.I know this is from a children's book, and that explains a lot of the dull, episodic nature of the film, but it is the filmmaker's job to ADAPT a book for screen to hopefully stay true to the heart and the spirit of the story, rather than be a slave to every word. War Horse is so literal that we (and Joey the horse) are whisked from owner to owner, for no other apparent reason than to show that some Germans like horses, and so do little girls. Each episode is so brief and/or so badly written that we have hardly established characterization before Joey is off to another new home. Situations that should be heart-rending are instead predictable and trite. While I'm opposed on principle to animals talking in movies, I think this may have been a film that could have worked better with a horsey voice-over, or even with a thorough rewrite, even if it was at the risk of alienating those who loved the book.The film is very miscast and the characters are clichés, while the situations are totally unbelievable. From the strapping, straight-toothed Dartmoor farm boy and his drunken father and his hardworking mother and their evil, rich laughing landlord etc etc etc, to training a young horse in five minutes to do what would actually take weeks, if not months. The film lost credibility hand over fist, culminating in a glaring anachronism of a dirt-poor farmer drinking from a jolly market-stall mug with cows on it.Like all his movies from Schindler's List onwards, Spielberg simply can't end a movie any more. Either he rambles on for half an hour past the perfect end-point, or he tries so hard to squeeze emotion out of his audience that things come full circle and become simply ridiculous. I won't spoil the ending because Steven Spoilberg has already done it for us. Suffice to say, I laughed out loud.HOWEVER There are two AMAZING scenes in War Horse - in a field of tall grass and of Joey running across Nomansland - both totally original reminders of how great Spielberg used to be. I give the movie a star for each of those and NOT A TWINKLE MORE!",War Horse
185,cadfile,War Horse is a film about war that doesn't splash blood on the kids,8,25 December 2011,"There has been a trend in war films of late for extreme realism. For example in Steven Spielberg's ""Saving Private Ryan"" the film opens with a long scene of fighting during the D-Day landings with all the blood and guts on full display. In Spielberg's new film ""War Horse"" he seems to go back the other way, back to the old days when war movies were sweeping epics and the main characters barely were scratched in savage fighting. As an adult I enjoy the more realistic war films but I can appreciate ""War Horse"" for still showing the carnage of war without splattering my kids face with blood and guts.Like any good children's story we spend quite a bit of time getting to know the star of the movie - ""Joey"" the horse and his human trainer Albert. We watch them bond and experience the trials and tribulations of farm life before World War I. Also like children's stories with animals as the main character, Joey is given anthropomorphic actions that show up at different times to give the horse more character. This anthropomorphism works without being obvious like adding Jar Jar Binks to the Star Wars mythology for the toy sales.The war scenes were as realistic as possible without showing actual deaths or gallons of blood spraying all over the place. I would be concerned if this wasn't a children's story but it is a decent introduction into what war is really about. When people are killed the scene is either a long shot with not much detail, something passes in front of the camera at the exact moment of the shot, or the death is not shown at all but the scene plays out that lets you know a death happened.Most of the human cast consisted of little known or unknown British actors which works since the story is strictly British. They also used French actors for the French parts and German for the German parts.David Kross, Emily Watson, and Benedict Cumberbatch were the only people I had heard of before and I really liked Watson's take on Albert's mother Rose. The rest of the cast did a good job.The rest of the elements were well done. The war scenes were technically well done and the locations in the film looked beautiful.This is a great family film where you don't have to worry too much about what your children will see.",War Horse
186,intern-88,Making a fairytale of the First World War,7,6 June 2012,"While one can hardly disregard the man's influence on modern cinema, it's easy to take Steven Spielberg for granted. Having produced some of the most iconic films of the mainstream format we rarely think of him as a distinctive auteur, yet there is nevertheless an inimitable richness and charm to his work which is wholly his own.Adapted from Michael Morpurgo's award-winning children's novel, War Horse is a film that straddles the two forms in which Spielberg is most comfortable. Part war film, part family blockbuster, it is a compelling and delightfully syrupy epic, that warms the heart in a way only Spielberg can.It tells the story of Devonshire lad, Albert Narracott (Jeremy Irvine), and his trusty horse, Joey, who are torn apart by the outbreak of the First World War. With the rent due and a malevolent landlord on his back, Albert's father (Peter Mullan) sells Joey to an army cavalryman (Tom Hiddlestone), and Albert enlists in order to find his equine paramour and bring him home safely. Over the next four years, Joey gallops his way across both sides of the conflict providing us with a panoramic view of the war and the people caught up in it. It is a nostalgia piece through and through, full of mustachioed army captains and regurgitated clichés about the plucky wartime spirit. This combined with the disturbingly romantic boy-horse bond that underpins the narrative, makes it all feel faintly ridiculous. But despite all this, it somehow comes off.This is largely due to Spielberg's refusal to pull any punches when it comes to depicting the harsh reality of warfare. While this is, of course, a family film and he is forced to play the game and shield anything too gory from young eyes, he doesn't sanitise the content. In the battle sequences, the camera is often high up, and far enough away that we don't see any blood splatter or severed limbs, but the panning aerial shots showing a throng of soldiers dropping like flies under machine-gun fire are devastating nonetheless.However, even after the toughest of scenes, the film retains its gooey centre. As Joey journeys across war-torn France, we are shown a series of interlinked vignettes depicting the tragedy of war and the humanity that survives in spite of conflict. This is expressed through a slew of familiar characters, from the underage soldier, who lies about how old he is to get a slice of the glory, to the courageous general, who must march his men to certain death. But as banal as these appear at first, even the most cynical viewer won't be able to resist the relentless emotional torrent for long.The film feeds on the mythology surrounding the First World War, and places it in a vivid and rigorously detailed epic setting. There are very few left who lived through the so-called Great War, but we have all, in a sense, grown up with it and have been led to associate it with a wistful heroism and tragic nobility. This is unashamedly indulged here. Even the historic Christmas Truce football match is transposed into a scene in which an English and a German soldier meet in no-man's land to cut Joey free of some barbed wire.While this film does little more than turn the First World War into a fairytale, it is nevertheless a moving and enjoyable watch. Admittedly, the story of Joey the war horse is about as believable as that of E.T.: The Extra-Terrestrial, but if you leave your cynicism at the door, War Horse may just surprise you.",War Horse
187,mistarkus,Pleasant,7,28 November 2011,"War Horse is a pleasant, sometimes poignant, typical, well done Hollywood experience. Uniquely focuses on the horse, Joey, more so than any of the other human characters. We follow Joey on his journey as he touches on the different people that come into his life during World War I. The characters are so drawn to Joey that they can not help but to so desperately desire to continue to possess the mythological horse. The filmmaker is able to tell stories with a lot of heart and we do care for all these characters even the ones with smaller roles (the people) but especially for the main character, Joey the horse.The time period (World War I) is a refreshing one and unique as far as war movies. The time period has not been overly played-out as opposed to World War II movies. The distinctive aspects of that war that changed all wars are somewhat explored such as the immobile stalemate of trench warfare, the horrors of it and the fraternization of the enemy combatants.One of the best aspects is the dazzling cinematography that takes advantage of the lush green lands of England or Ireland. Beautiful camera shots and sets transport us to cottages and windmills immersed in vast green meadows that seem so warm, quaint, and peaceful.You feel for the horse and witness the horse (or multiple horses) actually acting. You can almost see altered facial expressions in the horse and you can penetrate deep emotions in the horses eye. The training of these horses to ""act"" seems like a remarkable feat and it is but it doesn't make a remarkable movie.Despite having an old fashion flavor by both employing a wide lens camera shot, which permits a focus on many characters set against an expansive vista in a single shot, and the slower more immersing pacing, War Horse did not have an epic feel that might be hoped for or expected. It was a war movie, but it barely scratched the surface of the ideas of that war nor was it a truly epic, amazing adventure with the horse. Keeping it within the proper time frame and within the parameter of the PG-13 rating created an accessible experience for most people including children but was a bit too much within the bounds of typical Hollywood. However, it was still a nice, pleasant, family film best seen and recommended to be seen in the theater in order to capture the beautiful cinematography and style.",War Horse
188,Reel_starz,The human side of war,8,29 December 2011,"Steven Spielberg has been called many things: ""boy wonder"", ""visionary"", ""hack"". But even Spielberg's detractors – and there are many – have to admit that, regardless of whether the film-maker caters to the masses or indulges in sentimentality, he is a master of the medium. If recent offerings like Minority Report and Munich proved that he is willing to explore darker, more adult fare, then War Horse reminds us that the director has not lost the uncanny ability to charm and shock audiences that catapulted him to stardom in the 1970s. Indeed, this sprawling, old-fashioned tale of a farm boy and his beloved horse feels much like a fusion of E.T. and Saving Private Ryan, two movies that, while seemingly polar opposites, exemplify the childlike sincerity that has defined much of Spielberg's career. Heartrending, triumphant and visually magnificent, War Horse provides a glimpse of a cinematic wunderkind at his best.The movie follows a horse named Joey as he develops a close friendship with a naïve teenage boy, only to be sold off to the British army for usage in World War I (the last major war to use cavalry) and subsequently passed between numerous different owners. It sounds straightforward and, for the most part, it is; Anna Sewell first wrote from the point of view of an animal over a century ago in Black Beauty, a novel to which War Horse bears a striking resemblance. In fact, the first half hour or so isn't much different from typical animal movies like Old Yeller and My Dog Skip: the boy, Albert, acquires Joey, his pet, despite the reservations of his parents; they slowly yet surely form a bond as strong as that between any two humans; the animal helps its human friend confront a major dilemma – in this case, the impending seizure of the family's farm; due to unexpected circumstances, the human is tragically forced to part with his pet. However, while most movies end there, this is only the beginning of War Horse, and, although the first act is compelling enough, not until Joey and Albert separate does the movie really kick into high gear. Sweeping from peaceful, rustic farms to grimy, death-ridden trenches, the film drifts along, leisurely yet never sluggish, inviting viewers to absorb the scenery, a rich tapestry of landscapes so relentlessly, overwhelmingly gorgeous that they feel dream-like, though thankfully, it never succumbs to the idle self-indulgence that plagued such visual extravaganzas as Terrence Malick's poetic-yet-inscrutable The Tree of Life. It's the kind of majestic, ambitious epic that hasn't graced movie theaters since, well, Saving Private Ryan.Of course, even the most far-reaching sagas have intimate moments mixed in with the larger-than-life heroics, and War Horse is no exception. As Joey navigates the numerous perils of World War I, we are introduced to a vast assortment of characters, including the goodhearted Captain Nicholls and the carefree girl, Emilie, not to mention Albert himself and his troubled parents. On paper, the human characters seem unremarkable, not particularly vivid or memorable, but thanks in large part to the uniformly strong cast, they feel alive, people with whom anyone can sympathize. Although the actors are secondary to the story and visuals, a couple of them still manage to shine: the only person with a substantial amount of screen time, Jeremy Irvine displays a wealth of promise (War Horse is his first feature film role), and he shares easy chemistry with his animal counterpart; Emily Watson instills Rose Narracott, Albert's mother, with a riveting mixture of fiery pragmatism and melancholic weariness; after his charismatic, coolly menacing turn as Loki in the gaudy Thor, Tom Hiddleston takes on the radically different role of Captain Nicholls, yet, despite the more easygoing nature of his character, he has no trouble commanding the audience's attention with his bizarrely expressive eyes and effortless poise; and lastly and most unexpectedly, first-time actress Celine Buckens practically leaps off the screen in her feisty, self-assured performance as the young Emilie. Nonetheless, as indicated by its title, the star of the film is the horse, and the way in which the film-makers coaxed various emotions – fear, desperation, anger, sorrow, pain – out of its animal performers is simply awe-inspiring. Despite not saying a word, Joey is as nuanced and captivating as any human.It may sound like hyperbole, but War Horse is truly unique in its portrayal of war, unlike any other movie in recent memory. Although lacking the gritty, devastating immediacy of Saving Private Ryan, Spielberg's latest has a power of its own, arising primarily from its brilliant imagery. Acclaimed cinematographer and long-time Spielberg collaborator Janusz Kaminski paints this strange, contradictory world as only a true master can, with each shot deftly crafting an atmosphere of stark beauty: soldiers mount their horses amid a sea of tall, yellow grass; casualties lie strewn across a ravaged battlefield (in a shot reminiscent of Gone With the Wind); gas envelops the silhouette of a single figure; flares explode above the head of a galloping horse; snow swirls around a cluster of battered men. Whereas most modern-day war movies rely on violence and gore to create a ""realistic"" portrait of war, the effectiveness of War Horse lies in images like those, and it could be argued that the absence of lurid details makes the film all the more potent. Whereas Saving Private Ryan explored the cruelty of war, War Horse searches for the hope that can be found amid the cruelty. As always, Spielberg treads the fine line between poignancy and melodrama, yet although it's hard not to wonder whether he could have delved a little deeper (the ending, while not unsatisfying, feels somewhat rushed), he shows much more restraint than his critics would be willing to admit. Free of pretension and cynicism, War Horse is a lyrical, compassionate story about the struggle to remain innocent amid senseless brutality that feels old-fashioned but never outdated. To the most influential director of his generation, welcome back.",War Horse

It was raw and real, and I could feel the horse's warmth. Watch this movie. My mother and father enjoyed it very much. It doesn't matter if it's sappy or if it's just like any other sappy horse movie, because it's actually not. The required field that this gave was feeling. I could feel the owner's happiness and I could feel the fear of everyone there. I give this a 7 because it was a very real story, but it could use some more differences from other movies like this.

193,comicman117,A Man and his Horse,8,17 January 2012,"War Horse (2011) directed by Steven Spielberg. Screenplay by Lee Hall and Richard Curtis, based off the book by Michael Morpurgo. Starring Emily Watson, David Thewlis, Peter Mullan, Niels Arestrup, and Jeremy Irvine.I don't how many movies I've seen where the character has a horse as a pet, that takes center stage (too many to count). Although I can't recall ever seeing a movie where the story is about the horse being involved in the war.Steven Spielberg's War Horse, just so happens to be that case.The plot involves a young man named Albert (Jeremy Irvine). One day his father brings home a horse (a thoroughbred foal to be exact), that he won at an auction. Albert becomes fascinated by the horse and names it Joey. Much of the time he spends with the horse, has him training it, eventually causing the Horse to push over a hillside field, planting it with wild turnips.A rainstorm comes and destroys the turnip field. Attempting to pay the rent, Ted (Albert's Father played by Peter Mullan) sells Joey to the Captain Nicholls (Tom Hiddleston), a Cavalry Officer, without informing Albert of doing it. Albert finds out, and rushes to enlist in the war, but is incapable of doing so because of his age. He is informed by Captain Nicholls that he will take care of Joey. The remaining part of the story centers around Albert's attempt to find Joey eventually successfully enlisting in the army, and also centering around a French Girl named Emile (Celine Buckens), who happens to have gotten a hold of Joey.From the trailer and the description, War Horse seems like another one of those wannabe Oscar Baiters. The music by John Williams would seem to imply that (it's extremely over dramatic, as expected). But the movie actually successfully succeeds in making you feel for it's characters. I was emotionally enthralled when Albert lost Joey, because I could actually feel for the characters, due to excellent development on their relationship.The direction is superb. Steven Spielberg isn't a legend for nothing. The way he directs some scenes are amazing, especially the battle scenes, which are amazingly well done. I never got dizzy or non-relaxed while watching War Horse. + The script is first rate. Adapting a children's novel by Michael Morpurgo, Lee Hall and Richard Curtis have written a screenplay that well develops it central characters, doesn't have any massive plot holes, and gives people a satisfying ending.The acting is pretty good. The cast mostly consists of British actors, and some Germans. The lead actor Jeremy Irvine does a pretty good job in playing his character (although maybe he shouldn't be so melodramatic all the time). Peter Mullan plays the father, and with that Scottish Accent of his he seems sort of out of place in this film, but he does a fine job playing his character. Emily Watson who plays the mother, does a superb job with her role, playing a female character who is extremely strong, and not just another female stereotype that some Hollywood films have been known to use. French actor Niels Arestrup plays Emile's Grandfather, and comes off in his portrayal as being a little clumsy at times but very strong willed.If there was one thing that I had to say that I didn't like about War Horse, it would be the obvious attempt to market this film towards the Academy Awards. Everything from the music, to the advertisement (which went as far as to point out the fact that the film had been nominated for a Golden Globe), and even some of the acting. But aside from that, War Horse is definitely worth your time. I suggest you check it out, before it leaves theaters.",War Horse
194,thegodfathersaga,'crowd pleaser' and 'Oscar bait',4,12 January 2012,"War Horse is one of my least favorite film of the year; everything about it screams 'crowd pleaser' and 'Oscar bait'. an epic adventure for audiences of all age, set in WW1, about a horse (an innocent, instinctive main character that the viewer is obliged to love) and his remarkable friendship with a courageous, guiltless young man fighting to save the family farm and to save his friend, the horse is taken on a wild journey through war changing and inspiring the lives of those he meet.. the film really seems like a medley of tear-jerking clichés, thrown together with poor fairytale quality, some pretty cool directing moments and annoying manipulated sentimentality. some of the cast are amazing talents that are hugely wasted in the cheesy script; ""a miracle horse!"" they say.. laughable fake French accent (it's really English but it's supposed to be French so you decide), golden sunsets, luxuriously over-the-top cinematography, the fact that under the beauty/symbolism of the horse -a great animal- there's really nothing human or universal to connect with; all of these serve as low points for the film..",War Horse
195,ticket_for_one,First great film of 2012.,9,14 January 2012,"Phar Lap, Seabiscuit and Hidalgo are films based on true stories. Special horses doing remarkable things. War Horse is a fictional tale about a special horse doing remarkable things. I loved it! Spielberg does it again. War Horse is based on a children's novel set before and during World War I, by British author Michael Morpurgo. Then it was made into a hugely successful stage play. Spielberg bought the rights and now we have the film. And based on what I've saw two days ago. War Horse is a strong contender for best picture in this awards season. War Horse is about a horse Joey (of course) born and raised on a farm before the 1st World War. Farm boy Albert (Jeremy Irvine) befriends the horse and forms a strong bond with Joey. Soon after, war breaks out and boy and horse become separated. Joey then goes on a series of adventures encountering different people along the way. He becomes a War Horse for the Germans then the British, in the trenches, then the Germans again. Everyone Joey comes across falls in love with him and creates the same bond Albert did with him on the farm. After 4 years apart Albert are reunited again. That's more or less the short of it. Performances are very good (with one exception) although at times felt quite staged. Peter Mullan, Emily Watson, Benedict Cumberpatch, Niels Arestrup, I could go on, all are great. But the Jeremy Irvine is brilliant as Albert. You really feel that he's connected to the horse. In every scene they're together in you'll believe Joey's his horse. Even the scenes where Albert is without the horse, dealing with parents especially his father and the harsh realities of war, Irvine shows great emotional range. Spielberg said he's a star in the making, like Christian Bale was in Empire of the Sun. He's definitely one to lookout for.Richard Curtis' adapted screenplay will pick up a few nominations. It's a very funny script as well as heartfelt. Set pieces in particular the battle scenes are brilliantly choreographed. Not Private Ryan brilliant but brilliant in the sense that this being a 12?, you still see the horror of war without showing too much blood and gore. If I have any negatives about War Horse is that it does drag slightly in the second act. Yeah there are some cringe worthy, sentimental moments but nothing to get the handkerchief out for. Great script, brilliantly acted and Spielberg's direction is solid and consistent as usual. Go see!",War Horse
196,Foux_du_Fafa,"Imperfect, though well shot and thought provoking",7,20 March 2012,"Prior to seeing ""War Horse"", I had read Michael Morpurgo's book. Even though it may be a children's novel, it has as much as much for an adult reader as there is for a young reader. Against the sombre backdrop of the First World War is the simply told, heart-warming story of a horse and his beloved young master - in short, a wonderful mix.I may be over-simplifying things, especially as the film is arguably more an adaptation of the London stage production, but the translation from page to screen does turn the story far more into an overall commentary on the First World War than the story of a horse and his young master; one such example would be the treatment of Joey the horse's health issues, which are not as widely covered in. As such, the film is not as involving as it could have been. None the less, it is still overall very emotionally effective, a reflective experience that really puts one's life into perspective and makes one really wonder what worth war is. What's more is that there is some absolutely fantastic cinematography, ranging from scenes of stunning horse rides across the Devon countryside to smoky battle shots (not to mention quick homages to previous epics, most notably a nod to ""Gone With the Wind"" at the end of the film). Though ultimately flawed, ""War Horse"" is still definitely worth a watch.",War Horse
197,trevor-mcinsley,Sit Boy... Good Horse,10,23 May 2013,"Honestly didn't think I would like this film when I went into it. I had heard a lot about it and figured it would just be a sappy, cliché, chick-flick... etc. Indeed it pretty much is all of those things and more. I still like it however and I was a tad confused as to why when so many people have pretty aptly branded it as 'Oscar bait'.I guess it is because I have watched so many WWI documentaries, read so much on the subject and been to so many museums. Basically there is nothing in this film which couldn't happen in real life and it should be looked at more as a collection of short stories strung together by a main plot. In fact, if you know your history then Saving Private Ryan is virtually the same thing but about WWII (with significantly less about horses of course). As with that film there is a lot of historical accuracy weaved throughout the plot. The stupidity of cavalry charges against machine guns in the early days of the war, the punishing treatment of horses, the bonds that some men formed with the animals as an escape from the horror all around them and the ultimate fate of a lot of these animals.I am not an animal lover. Be clear on that. I would sooner bludgeon a horse to death with its own severed genitalia and feast on its still warm corpse than I would go near a Ceasar salad.The fact that I like this film is not because I get all hot under the collar about horses. Frankly I have always found horse people to be a bit scary and weird anyway. No, I feel that this film ultimately just has good direction and a good story. It represents a collection of stories from the Great War which you do not have to look far in the history books for to find close facsimiles to.Ironically I think this film would be viewed in higher regard by more people if there were no film awards to earn and no film critics to appease. If people could just watch a film and either like it or dislike it without concerning themselves about what shiny piece of metal it won this week and what coveted something or other it earned the next...I lost you at the severed horse genitalia line didn't I?",War Horse
198,markdroulston,Bore Horse,3,12 January 2012,"What on earth has happened to Steven Spielberg? Despite large amounts of negativity surrounding War Horse, I was firmly of the opinion that anything the legendary director had to offer was worth taking a chance on and seeing in the cinema. Now I'm not so convinced.After not releasing a film since 2008's widely derided Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull, a film which even The Beard himself seems content to blame on best friend George Lucas, Spielberg has returned with two high profile releases in the last month. The Adventures of Tintin was underwhelming aside from a handful of spectacular set pieces, but with War Horse he delivers such a contrived, pathetically sappy piece of fluff that I honestly have a hard time deciding whether the films is meant to be taken seriously, or is in fact some kind of bizarre parody. Spielberg has always teetered into an over- reliance on sentimentality, yet in this latest film he turns the attempted heart string pulling up to eleven, and what we end up with is a completely phony and unauthentic set of vignettes all tied together by our hero: Joey the wonder horse. It feels like one of those 'truth is stranger than fiction' stories that you would never believe if it didn't really happen, with one key difference: this story isn't true. It didn't really happen. And so, I never believed in any of it for a second.War Horse takes the entire first act to build up the character of Joey, who we're told to believe is a special horse for some reason which is never really made clear. Perhaps 'told' is the wrong word to use. OK, we're beaten over the head with how special this horse is. Following the outbreak of World War I, Joey is sold to the military, in the care of Captain Nicholls (Tom Hiddleston), to be sent to the front to aid the war effort. Given that WWI is likely to remain the last time horses were widely used in combat, there is potentially interesting stuff here, but after a moderately engaging 20 minutes or so Joey winds up in the hands of two German army deserters. Odd choice, but perhaps Spielberg will allow something to develop here. No, 20 minutes later and our two Germans are out of the picture and this increasingly infuriating horse finds himself being taught how to jump by a young French girl. And so we go on, with stories beginning all over the place, only to be abandoned in quick succession. One thing is constant however, which no-one in the film seems to be aware of: this horse is a frighteningly bad omen, and each new person who comes across Joey and immediately falls for his plucky charm is living on borrowed time. But, luckily for Joey, after spreading misery and death throughout Europe there's always another poor soul waiting in the wings to take up the reins. I'll stress again, I just don't know how to take this seriously.War Horse is going to be remembered as one of the worst films in Spielberg's catalogue. It is a movie which abandons all logical cause and effect narrative in favour of simply having things happen without reason, in a glaringly deliberate attempt to enamour audiences to this horse. Spielberg tries to work audience emotions like a twisted puppet master, commanding us to feel on cue, but it is my sincere hope that viewers are smart enough to realise when they are being manipulated. I'm sure Spielberg still has interesting movies to make (fingers crossed for Lincoln later this year), but War Horse comes up lame from the opening scene, and I wish someone had the good sense to put it out of its misery with a bullet to the head.tinribs27.wordpress.com",War Horse

But i loved the war scenes and i loved the photography and the cinematography of this movie. They were excellent! the characters, well not so much. The characters were not introduced very well and it was very poor. I liked the plot of this movie but it did not really go well with the whole movie and all.

200,RoamingTigress,Brilliantly moving,10,3 January 2012,"I have seen so few movies that have affected me like War Horse had done. I believe the last movie which had made almost as big of an impact, was back in 1994 when The Lion King made a lasting impression on me. To say this movie had impressed me and become a new favourite of mine today, would be an understatement.Although regarded as many as being nothing but sap, I feel this could not be further from the truth. The story is a simple one and in my eyes, this is a good thing. Not every movie has to have a complex storyline to be effective. There is just so much heart in War Horse, which I feel is sadly lacking in too many movies, replaced by cheap CGI.The harsh realities of war for both man and beast were tastefully shown, and few can deny the outstanding cinematography from the rolling hills of the English countryside, to the stark No Man's Land. The expressions of the very well trained horses were beautifully captured. Who said animals are incapable of showing emotion? I also believe their human counterparts were very well played; both sides are shown to have suffered the terrible effects a war brings.In short, well done, Spielberg. Well done.If you haven't already, do consider reading the book the movie is based on by Michael Morpurgo and the stage play, which this movie had made me more excited about seeing in Toronto this upcoming April. All three takes on War Horse are no doubt in my mind, a fine tribute for the millions of horses that had sacrificed their lives in the war.Remember: they had no choice.",War Horse

I mean ET if you are 6 years old. But he is not a talented director; just a famous director that makes films from cookie cutter molds.I mean the acting is horrendous, maybe because the script is horrendous. the score is rubbish, so cliché. Is there any surprises in this film? the minute it started you already knew the ending. A lot of dead end characters one after the other, in a very disjointed narrative which has zero glue or arch to push it into the film genre of quality material. I felt nothing for any character, when they died it was like --Oh well. Someone said he was ticking Oscar boxes, if that is true he must have missed some of the relevant ones. Like good script and good directing. And let us not talk about mismatch cinematography. What is up with that sunset at the end? Looks richer than the view from Venus. Out of the blue (or red) comes this over dramatic scene of clichés at the end. What a tired non-creative piece of utter garbage. And it tells you something about the sincerity of reviewers and the Hollywood industry. What serious critique looks at this contrived, poorly written drivel and says it is good. Steven is over rated and the price for being overrated is that whatever he does wins Oscars. That has happened so often now, if there was any challenge to him to get better--well it is gone. Next time i see his name I will avoid. This is a lesson for those who betray the arts and accept accolades they do not deserve. they have sold out their art for the little trinkets their dishonest peers give them.",War Horse
202,fivecentscribe,Stop Horsing Around,4,18 June 2019,The beautiful cinematography can't stop the pretentious and over indulgent nature of this film wherein Spielberg settles for gross sentimentality all the while being too self-conscious as the director behind he camera.,War Horse
203,italo505,That Horse deserves an Oscar!,10,3 January 2013,"The story begins when a young boy named Albert Narracott (played by newcomer Jeremy Irvine) who takes on the care of an admirable horse he names Joey and struggles to keep this horse in spite of his family economic struggles.. One day Albert and his horse are put to the test when the landlord comes to collect the overdue rent or take the horse away from the Narracotts. Albert has to teach his horse to plow a field and get it ready for next harvest but, after a few times that the horse attempts to pull the plowing equipment through the dry soil, they fail terribly as everybody begins to walk away in disappointment. When everything seems to be a lost cause it suddenly begins to rain facilitating Albert and his horse to plow the field, and restoring the family's pride and honor.Unfortunately, the Narracotts are unable to come up with enough money for their mortgage (it sounds like the average American's story right here) and World War II is about to begin so they begin to look for horses to serve in the war. When Albert finds out about his father's intentions to sell his precious horse he runs over to town to stop this trade. His father is devastated as well but they're paying him top money for Joey and, during times of war, that's the best chance they will get to sell their horse. It's sad watching Albert being separated from Joey and, as much as he begs to join the infantry to be together with his noble horse, he's too young to join the military yet. From this point on the story takes us from one owner to another as the horse is first seen in a battlefield where his rider gets killed in combat; then we see him go behind enemy lines and meets another black horse, at first they challenge each other at first but they begin a ""friendship"" of sorts. Our horse (I should call him Joey, just to make it easier) always comes through for his friend and saves him many times from doing strenuous work that Joey's been used to doing before and, by doing so, saving his friend's life. Suddenly, I began seeing Joey, his friend and the other horses as equally engaging as their human counterparts. It's incredible but you can't help but care for whatever happens to this horse while the war develops, it's like you've become attached to him somehow and you fear for his life every step of the way.SPOILER ALERTS AHEAD There are some scenes in the movie that mad me question: how inhumane we humans can be? These noble animals are so loyal and smart that they deserve as much respect and admiration as any other soldier fighting WWI. There was a moment in the movie when Joey watches his friend, the black horse, die from exhaustion. It sparks something in Joey that cannot be describes in words, I just needed to watch on the screen and see Joey run run through the battlefield, taking barriers of barbwire along the way until he could run anymore. It was as if the war had finally claimed his life.Somewhere in the trenches there was also Albert, who had also joined the military and was fighting the war, always looking for his horse Joey. Albert, as his horse, also loses a friend in the line of combat and we get a glimpse of the nightmare that is the war in all of its gory and nightmarish nature as only a sensible Steven Spielberg could ever do. As I was watching the scenes of war it reminded me of Saving Private Ryan and the symbolism that it represents for the director whose own father was a war veteran himself. At the heart of War Horse, there is a scene that will have me crying along with most people in the audience that day. The scene finally reunites Albert and his best friend Joey after four years of war in one of the most heartbreaking scene I've ever recalled to see in film before. It's a reunion so touching that it brought tears to my eyes; a reunion of two friends broken up to be brought back together by destiny, against all the odds. It's a scene that I would have never thought it'd be so touching yet it was. Now I understand why the stage play, in which they use puppeteers to give the horse live on the stage every night, is such a hit as well as this movie is.",War Horse

A long, less than thrilling series of events takes the horse through multiple owners (all equally mesmerized by horsey charm) and don't you know it we end up back with the first farming family.

What this movie brings and ""1917"" lacks is the emotional intensity, beautiful soundtrack and a better storyline overall. This one has been made in 2011 and it has such good effects that I've seen it to compete with some recent made movies.All of the features stated above make of ""War Horse"" a must-see. If you are a fan of movies that are based on wars and more so, if you would like to see a title that it's even better than ""Dunkirk"" and ""1917"", then you really have to watch this movie.",War Horse
206,supernma,The Best Picture of 2011,10,5 January 2012,"""War Horse"" is not a movie for modern audiences, and would be best suited in 1939 alongside ""Gone with the Wind"" and ""The Wizard of Oz."" While watching it, I couldn't help but think of ""National Velvet"", ""Lassie Come Home"", or ""How Green Was My Valley"". The entire film, from its tone to its art direction is an homage to the old Hollywood studio film, something John Ford could have easily directed without losing any of his trademarks. It is this old fashioned, nostalgic style that ultimately makes the film one of the most endearing and spectacular films of the year.The cinematography is without a doubt the film's biggest achievement, featuring golden skies, sweeping green landscapes, and dark, murky battlefields. The entire film is nothing less than gorgeous, and adds a sense of wonder and magnificence that perfectly suits the material.Much has been said concerning the tone of the film, which switches between sentimentalist romanticism and gritty war drama, and I believe Spielberg balances the two perfectly, never missing a step in the rhythm of the film. Are some moments corny? Of course, because that is exactly what Spielberg was going for: a non-cynical, heartfelt wartime fairytale of a boy and his horse. This is not ""Saving Private Ryan"", just as it's not ""Free Willy"". It's a film that will please both older children and adults - something unoffensive, but does not hold back; something sappy, but without losing its sincerity -- a truly unique thing in today's hardened world.John William's score is also wonderful (one of his best in years), and is just enough to push you over that edge to cause a tear to stroll down your cheek, but is never overbearing or intrusive.Overall, while some may find the film to be nonsense or emotionally manipulative, I feel they are missing the point: ""War Horse"" is all the things films used to be - sweet, simple, and despite countless struggles and hardships, inevitably uplifting; it might just be the best film of 2011.",War Horse

208,stancym-1,Sentimental journey with anti-war theme underpinning,9,3 February 2012,"Reviewing it while the memory is fresh, just saw the film. This is a true family film and will also appeal to anyone who has or has had a close connection with a pet or animal friend.There are some plot developments with the horse that do force one to adopt ""the willing suspension of disbelief."" Things that just are not like real life, or logical. But the story is so sweet and beautiful, you don't really care.The film has a strong case to make against war. And indeed, most of the time the human as well as financial cost of war is NOT WORTH IT. When you think about World War 1, you really think of the waste of so many young men's lives. That's one of the points Spielberg is making. The author of the original book, Michael Morpurgo, is also making the point that thousands upon thousands of innocent horses suffered injury and illness, or starved, or were killed in battle during that war.War Horse borders on overly-sentimental, which is why it gets a 9 instead of a 10. But the cinematography is wonderful, the horse is amazing, the acting is fine, you are never bored, and we all need a story like this sometimes.Humans are seen at their best, most of the time.

But like some other viewers, it was a huge let down. As others have said, cliché-ridden stereotypes abound. The plot is unrealistic and the script atrocious. The outdoor shots look really fake with bad lighting and the performances were weak. Characters one dimensional and I think historically inaccurate (although I'd need to check this).The movie begs many questions: The ending was pathetic—why would the farmer pay such a huge amount and then walk away? They were going to shoot the horse one minute and yet it is in perfect health the next day. Bizarre. Did the father ever know his son stole his pennant? I am surprised by the positive reviews it has received but suspect that most of them were written by teenagers (as a kids/teen movie, it probably works) as this is certainly not a film for adults. Certainly the worst movie of 2011 and one of the worst I have seen. Over-hyped—a complete waste of time.",War Horse

Director Steven Spielberg, however, presents the story on an ""Epic"" scale which is all wrong. I kept thinking of ""The Fantastics"" done as ""Titanic"" while I was watching this movie. Because the story is so good, I kept wanting to watch it (on DVD). But after watching this film, what I really want to do is get tickets to the Broadway show.

The film was professionally made, it looked amazing, sounded great. Legendary composer, John Williams crafted an amazing and beautiful score. It was one of the best, I've heard in years.Jeremy Irvine delivers a very heartfelt and convincing performance, he's just great. The rest of the cast, Emily Watson, Peter Mullan, David Thewlis, Tom Hiddleston, etc were all great, as well. However the star of the film, The Horse was simply amazing, the facial expressions were all spot on. Its just great, how you see the movie, from a horse perspective. Steven Spielberg deserves a lot of praise for that, and I hoper he gets it.The cinematography is as good as it gets, its simply astounding. The film's cinematographer, Janusz Kamiński deserves all the praise he gets, an Oscar surely awaits him. The movie deserves all the technical praise, it gets. The editing is well done, the art direction is spectacular, the look of the film is quite breathtaking, at times.The film is uncompromisingly sentimental, and I wasn't annoyed by it. Because it worked so well, it made me care about the story, the characters, the horses. A good old fashion studio epic, I miss them and I'm happy Spielberg delivered one. There are a lot of powerful scenes in the movie, from which I cried. It was just so moving, it showed the true consequences of war. Some of the battle sequences were simply fantastic and astonishing.I am happy to see, Steven Spielberg in his top form. He showed, that he's still one of the best in the business and I hope to see more of him in the future. It may not be his best film, but it certainly a wonderful film to watch.

The highlight of the movie is the barbed wire scene of the horse. Though I did not like Spielberg's staunch insistence on happy ending which leaves a soft impression to such a superfluous and heavy handed movie based on the World War calamity! WAR HORSE is merely a mixed bag. The fashion in which plains, prairies, fields, and even horses are depicted is downright beautiful. But that's to be expected from a Spielberg film, who has all the money in the world to throw into his productions.

215,devcybiko,They just don't make them like that anymore,9,3 January 2012,"WEEKLY MOVIE REVIEW : WAR HORSE MINI-REVIEW : They just don't make them like that anymore RATING : See it in theaters (Rating System: ""See it in theaters,"" ""Wait for the instant download,"" ""Don't waste your time"")It's 1914 and young Albert Narracott (Jeremy Irvine, ""Live Bites"") is the son of turnip farmer Ted Narracott (Peter Mullan ""The Fixer""). His father makes a fool-hardy purchase of a thoroughbred horse (Joey) to be used as a plow horse. The animal is spirited and clearly unique amongst its peers for its beauty and strength. The landlord threatens to foreclose on the farm unless Ted brings in the turnip crop in the spring. Albert and Joey defy all odds and plow the rocky field to the cheers of on-looking villagers. However, the crop fails and to pay the rent, Ted has to sell Joey to the British army as the onset of WWI requires horses for the cavalry. Albert volunteers, but at the tender age of 14 he is turned down. Captain Nicholls (Tom Hiddleston, ""Midnight in Paris"") promises the boy he'll take care of Joey. But he can't keep his promise as he is killed in his first battle and Joey falls into the hands of the Germans. And we're off as Joey is passed from one owner to the next through the duration of the war.If you've ever seen the classic epic films of the 1930's and 1940's you'll get a sense of what you're in for when you go to see ""War Horse."" Think of John Wayne and Maureen O'Hara in ""The Quite Man,"" or ""Gone With the Wind."" The scenery is vast and lush. The story spans years. The characters grow through their interactions not only with each other but with the times they are in.Spielberg has a lot of experience filming battle scenes (""Saving Private Ryan"") and none of it is wasted here. The battle scenes, especially those involving the horses, are exquisite. One thing that is of interest is that we never see anyone actually killed. We see all the events leading up to the death, and the events immediately after, but I don't recall anyone being killed on-screen. Perhaps Spielberg was specifically trying to avoid a strong comparison to his earlier work.Joey, the horse, is painted as a beast with immense heart. In some other director's hands the horse would be a mere vehicle to tell a story. It is too often that an animal turns into a caricature: Either drawn too thinly to be empathized with, or so broadly such that it is a cartoon (see most Disney features from the seventies). But here, Joey is a fully developed heroic character. Joey cares about his owners as they also care about him. We come to recognize the sacrifices Joey makes in favor of those around him and we cheer in his successes and wither in the face of his perils.This is a coming-of-age story. In fact it is a collection of coming-of-age stories with Joey knitting them together as the thread of a quilt. We witness young Albert train Joey, then save the farm, then lose his beloved animal. Then Joey goes on to serve the Captain who puts too much trust in his friend and senior officer. Next he escapes with two German boys. And he tries to learn to jump fences with a little French girl. And so on.It is also the story of a loss of innocence, not so much for Albert and the other young people Joey's life touches, but for Europe and the entire world. The war starts in 1914 with the British cavalry charging, swords drawn, only to be faced with automatic guns. Then, as the war progresses (and Joey's journey progresses), we see ever more advanced military armaments: machine guns, mustard gas, and long range artillery. By the time the war is over in 1918, the state of the world has gone from quiet, warm and organic to cacophonous, cold, and mechanized.If I might have any complaint, and I have scarce few, it is that the ending to the story is also borrowed from the 1930's classics. Without spoiling it for you, I will only say that this part of the screenplay seemed to have been given the least amount of attention. I had a hard time suspending disbelief and accepting that these events could really have happened So, for a movie filmed in the classic style with all the action of ""Saving Private Ryan,"" and heartwarming animal love of ""Old Yeller,"" yet told with a certain eye toward the innocence of those early movies, I heartily recommend you ""see it in theaters.""",War Horse
216,Adam Frisch,Casting wrong and collaborations getting stale.,3,26 December 2011,"First off, I find Spielberg to be one of the greatest directors of our time, so his considerable talents and skills are not in question. However, I do feel he was out of tune on this one. The main problem is the film's casting. Jeremy Irvine lacks the skills to bring his character to life and we fail to see what motivates him. It could be a script problem as well, but nevertheless he doesn't work and we don't care for him. He's unfortunately cast for his sweet looks, when a boy we could actually relate to would have been much better. The German boy that later appears does a much better job in a shorter period - why couldn't they have found someone like that to play Albert? It goes on from there - many characters turn up but are miscast. There's a French farmer and his granddaughter where the granddaughter has one of the worst faux-French accents in cinema history and does a really bad job. Niels Arestrup, the veteran French character actor, also does the best he can but his character is written very two dimensionally. Film is littered with badly written, badly cast characters. DP Janusz Kaminski also has over the years turned into a great over-lighter and there are harsh rims and an artificial light feel all over this film when naturalism would have been much better. Top this off with a terrible John Williams score completely lacking in any theme or melody and only being page one standard saccharine Hollywood fare designed to hit the cues, well, like on cue. It's utterly boring.Spielberg needs to change the people he works with and mix it up, or else he gets sucked into these cheese-traps. He should get Michael Mann's casting agent, Hans Zimmer (who's not afraid to take chances) to score and get a new DP in and we'd get a much better movie out if it.",War Horse
217,angie_l,Relentless,8,30 September 2012,"Minor spoilers, the only major one will be noted at the end.This is one of the most depressing movies I have seen in a long time and I am not exactly sure how to rate it. I enjoyed it and found it very emotionally provoking. The war scenes were interesting and well conveyed. However, some time ago, I realized that Spielberg's movies are pure sentimentality, sap, goo designed to get an emotional response. Is Spielberg a master story teller or a con man manipulating us emotionally? As for now, I am knowingly lapping up the emotional goo. However, while the content of his movie's I now hold in question, Spielberg's skills as a director are undeniable. The movie is gorgeous to look at and many of the scenes are artfully directed especially to cut down on gore.The story follows the war horse, Joey. While I have seen reviews where the reviewer was disappointed that the story followed the horse and made us root for him to survive while humans died, I didn't see it that way. Sure, we root for the horse but we also root for the humans (though Joey might be a bad omen for any human that comes near). While the story is Joey's, he really is a vehicle to show the tragedies of war, how much war demands on its participants and how much it takes away. Joey is merely the link between all of the tragic human stories. I love animals and I think those who see animals as simply tools for humans might not like that the movie showed the animal sacrifice. The horses were used in battle, some times to the point of abuse and many were killed for a conflict that they have no comprehension of. I am not saying the horses lives are of more or equal value to the humans but I think they do hold value and suffer pain. So war is horrible in that it takes human lives and its misery is only upped by the fact that the death and horror also extended to animals.My biggest issue with the movie is that it is relentless. There are no really bad people. There are those who are just matter of fact and do what's necessary. Then there are the ones who are innately good, sometimes too good.. but hard times can bring out the best in people. Because so many are presented as so good, their awful fates cut even deeper. I literally got to the point that I was debating what bad thing was going to happen to the next person we came to know and was mourning them before it even happened. Even in the end, we don't really rejoice, you just wonder for the horse and humans how much damage is left behind.The movie is beautifully directed with a good story line that might be too depressing at times. However, the movie is about war and there is little happy to write or say about that and Spielberg hammered home that message.SPOILER: The thing that bugs me the most about the story line is that Tad buys Joey while looking for a plow horse. Not only is it irresponsible to place that work on the breed of Joey, it is also irresponsible to waste the family money that way. Tad, out of pride, out bids his landlord and then is ready to shoot the horse and eventually sells him as their misfortune grows, huh? Even more irresponsibility, he knowingly took a huge risk in buying Joey. If Joey had been bought by the landlord, he probably would have lived happily ever after in a stable never having to work a day of his life nor sold into the war.",War Horse

The acting in this film in really fantastic Jeremy Irvine is simply wonderful casting and needs more film roles which he does not seem to be getting at the moment which is a shame he deserves more acting work, Peter Mullan as Albert's father is beautifully understated and not overly dramatic just the right complexities for his performance, Emily Watson's performance was of great calmness and subtlety really touching and quite moving in fact it's a great performance! I could go on about the performances by Benedict Cumberbatch and Tom Hiddleston which are very nice and subtle but I must mention Celine Buckens and Niels Arestrup who play Emilie and her Grandfather who give the best performances of the entire film their section with the horses Joey and Topthorn is simply delightful and one of the few sections of the film which has lightness and happiness in it also a sense of joy in that section really lovely 10 minute section of the film I just think the film with it's harrowing subject matter is also extremely hopeful and full of courage, the last 5 minutes alone will have you in floods of tears which the first time I saw the film happened to me and every repeat viewing since I can't stop crying at the end just stunning work by Steven Spielberg! The score by John Williams is simply perfection for the movie you can't place the score anywhere else outside of the movie simply beautiful stunning flute solos and moving horn solos too and beautiful themes for Joey and Albert's relationship the battles and the heartbreak of the war and a stunning end credits suite to cap it all off just a perfect score I think John Williams quite liked this movie it shows when you listen to the beautiful precision of the stunning flute solos the care he gives to those solos is stunning! All in all the film beautifully tells the story of the first world war for a family audience and does not frighten children I do not think so anyway I think the film moves it's audience and breaks their heart and tears come flooding out of them it certainly did for me anyway!

221,Kane20,Review - War Horse,10,2 July 2012,"I went saw War Horse in the theater in January. I've never read the book that the movie is based on, but I was hoping to like the movie, and I ended up loving it. Steven Spielberg has released some good movies in the past; Indiana Jones (the original trilogy; the fourth was a bit weak), Jurassic Park, Schindler's List – just to name a few. He has declined a bit during the past few years. Now, he's risen back up triumphantly with War Horse. War Horse is entertainment for the heart and soul, and, in my opinion, definitely one of Spielberg's best films to date.War Horse is the story of an elegant brown stallion, set during the time of World War I. A farmer buys this horse, and his son, Albert Narracott (Jeremy Irvine), calls him Joey. Albert raises, trains, and develops a strong friendship with the horse. However, as WWI starts, Joey is sold into cavalry. At this point, Albert is too young to enlist in the army and therefore stay with Joey, so for a while, the movie focuses only on the experiences of the horse, in and out of the line of battle. Will they be reunited? (I think you know the answer to that – the movie is pretty predictable.) I won't give away anything else about the story, but there are emotions, tears, etc. (even a few laughs here and there) throughout the film.The story is not original, and it's pretty clichéd and predictable. However, it works very well. I personally found it overall to be interesting, entertaining, gripping, and emotional. The first forty-five minutes or so of the film are a bit slow, and it's the weakest part of the film. However, like I said, it does establish the essential relationships we need for the rest of the movie, particularly between Albert and Joey. After this first act ends and the second act begins, things start picking up – pace emotion, etc. – and it gets much better. John Williams has returned along with Spielberg, and has composed a very good score for the movie, as he always does.Visually, the film is amazing, too. The cinematography and visual and special effects are very good, and really contribute to the emotion and tone of the film. The landscapes are very good, and so are the war effects. There are some action scenes that get pretty violent and gory, and the effects are really good here too, but it's still not extreme enough to go above a PG-13 rating (I'm not saying that's a bad thing, though). A couple particular noteworthy examples of the great visuals are the opening and closing shots, especially the latter. And like I said above, these visuals really contribute strongly to the emotion, narrative, and tone of the film.Overall, I really enjoyed this film. I'm glad I saw it in the theater. Despite its predictability and unoriginality (for which it gets quite a bit of hate on IMDb), I really found the story to be compelling and emotional. Personally, I don't think a movie has to be original to be good, as long as it's structured well, properly paced, and has sufficient heart, character, story, and emotion to make it a worthwhile experience. The best case is when a movie touches my heart and soul in some way. A good example is The Shawshank Redemption - predictable and unoriginal, yet it really touched my heart and soul, and I found the story compelling, and I loved the movie. Ultimately, whether or not a movie is good is a matter of personal opinion, not fact. For me, personally, I have to personally have a positive overall experience. This movie meets all these criteria well, at least for me. War Horse touched my heart and soul very strongly.My Rating: **** (out of ****)For more reviews, visit my website: http://robertsreliablereviews.blogspot.com",War Horse
222,marsanobill,"Long, Mostly Boring, Might Work for Kids",4,3 January 2012,"Please beware: SPOILERS throughout. This movie bears all the marks of a thing intended to become a 'beloved children's classic' that should generate royalties for decades to come. Well I don't know how it worked out for the novelist who published the original tale in the 1980s but it definitely won't work for Spielberg in 2012. There is gorgeous stuff to look at--the opening-credits aerial tour of rural England, the terrible beauty of the cavalry charge and Joey the Horse's riveting bolt for freedom. But there is no actual story, just a series of loosely connected episodes, and there is no character development, just tons of gooey, high-fructose sentimentality. Albie, the hero, is a nice boring kid from beginning to sappy, totally implausible end; his parents barely exist, and the only other character is Joey the Horse. There's no romance, either. Actually I'm surprised that the scriptwriters, whose dependence on impossible coincidence is almost an addiction here, didn't think to match Albie up with the orphaned, perky, winsome, wise-beyond-her-years (and ultimately tiresome) French farm girl but-- in a moment of inattentiveness--they offed her off-screen. For kids this could be a tough thing to watch. The combat scenes are not gory--no cheap bloodbaths, they--and they are even more affecting because of their restraint.So all concerned can forget the 'beloved children's classic' nonsense. No one's going to see this a second time.",War Horse
223,dracher,This is the absolute love it or hate it movie.,1,27 March 2012,"I gave it one star because the most appropriate word was right along side.A film maker must wring tears out of the audience when appropriate, and yes, the film must make money, or it would soon spell the end of film making as we know it. Therefore tears must be squeezed out of the audience, and money squeezed out of their wallets, or the process would die. Yes, even Mr Spielberg (who by the way need not contend with any theatrical or other production of the book, but rather needs must make a film on its own merits and by his own creative process) needs tears and money to flow as a result of his work, for exactly the same reason.The film is a dud in my opinion. The story is badly told and the characters are barely believable; the trenches of the great ugly war are sanitised beyond belief and the usual theatrical conventions are dumbed down to kindergarten level at the lowest, and grade school level at their highest. The suspension of disbelief has been compromised as never before and the cinematography looks like the film equivalent of painting by numbers, but with digital enhancement. The ethnicity of the story, as conveyed by the film makers, reads more like a bubble pack mix of Little House on the Prairie and The Muppets, with a sprinkling of 1950 Walt Disney thrown in to further sweeten the mix. The DVD should find a place on the bottom shelf, along with the millions of cartoon versions of Cinderella and Magic Roundabout. The film is truly awful.",War Horse
224,Booboboo,"Awful acting, ridiculous clichés and distracted storytelling",2,5 February 2012,"As this is an Oscar nominee, a Dreamworks-product carrying the name Steven Spielberg and a big budget supposed blockbuster I had high expectations. But I have probably never been so disappointed by a movie ever before! The acting is awful. Not even a handful people play a convincing character, the main boy has just two boyish expressions and the rest of the crew are on the verge of a rofl every time they face the camera.The story is a lose collection of horsefilm clichés, standard competition between rich and poor, living in the countryside and enduring a war. Flat characters only. Virtually no surprises appear over two hours of obviously expensive film. Just one or two scenes seemed plausible, shortly after drowned in another sunset shot, orchestral music and epic fail faces.I am deeply sorry, but there is nothing good to say about this movie.",War Horse

My choice would've been to see ""The Grey"" and thank god we saw ""War Horse"".I've read a number of reviews on ""Rotten Tomatoes"" and on IMDb stating the movie tries to hard to pull at your heart strings, but doesn't. I'll tell you one thing, when we saw the movie in the theatre, there were three scenes where the entire audience, in unison, sighed in pity. I figure that if you can do that in a film, you have success! Movies sell emotion... and the entire audience bought it! I agree that some of the character developments of the horse were pushing it, but not to the extent that it took away from the movie. This is about as ""Forest Gump"" as you can get with a horse character... loved it!",War Horse
226,poeticanarquica,One of the best adventure films of a full inspired Spielberg,9,21 July 2018,"War Horse is simple. Don't have any kind of tramps, spin or turns in his plot, but is a great example of how Steven Spielberg is one of the best story tellers in the history of cinema. This movie is a powerful piece of feeling, and a prodigy of technical talent.War Horse is made it at the ""old school style"" with a marvelous photography, an amazing soundtrack, a camera that just work close to perfection; and all of this with no overdose of CGI like the films of nowadays.
I' ve seen all the movies os his director and im pretty sure that this one have THE BEST SHOT ever made by Spielberg:
The scene of the Horse running out by the battle field... Because is just AWESOME. And see this part of the movie could be a good reason that deserves watch his more of two hours, and all the respect and admiration for one director that made us love that horse, like if was yours. Beautiful film.",War Horse
227,arginnon,A true masterpiece from a true master,9,4 May 2012,"Hold your horses! I expected this movie to be a heart-warming, decent Spielberg movie, but as it turns out, War Horse is a lot more than that. It is beautifully shot, has fantastic music, the directing is terrific and all in all the movie is awesome. I could go on and on about how good this flick is, and I'll do just that in a moment, but first I gotta point out the few things that I, personally, didn't like.I don't think I'm a bad person, but up to this point I didn't really like horses, or any animal as a matter of fact. I think they're messy, they smell bad and I never saw the perks of riding a horse, since we don't use them as transport anymore. However, even if I don't like real-life horses that much, movie horses are damn wonderful. At first I was annoyed with the horse- centeredness of this film, but then the magic touched me and I let it warm up my hairy heart, which made me realize the movie wasn't about the horse itself, but its affect on the people. It proves that no matter which side you fight on, we are all humans. Cheesy as it may sound, it's not the less true.I wanted to talk about the bad things, didn't I? Well it seems like there are no bad things in this movie after all. You may only dislike it if you really loathe horses, and I don't think there are any people who'd be so heartless. Anyway, War Horse had so many moving scenes alongside the grand war moments, the cinematography was spectacular as well as the directing. Thank you, Steven Spielberg for this amazing experience. Oh, John Williams, you're the man!I thought I wouldn't see any actors I'd recognize in the film. Well Tom Hiddleston, Peter Mullan, Benedict Cumberbatch, David Thewlis, Eddie Marsan, Tobby Kebbel and Liam Cunningham were all pleasant surprises. (Although I did see Cumberbatch in the trailer and I knew Thewlis was gonna be in it.)I'd recommend it to anyone who likes a really good movie about war and bondage, and those who like Steven Spielberg.",War Horse
228,dalelawson-1,Poor protagonist with a strong supporting cast,6,13 February 2012,"War Horse (Dir. Steven Spielberg, 2012) has a very uneventful introduction lead by Jeremy Irvine, who plays the protagonist Albert Narracott. His acting ability is questionable from the first instance he appears on screen and it is a fair assessment to say that the horse provides a more engaging and emotive character than Albert.But, weak protagonist and slow start aside, War Horse does contain elements of alternate Spielberg movies that we know and love. This film provides a strong emotional attachment to the horse and, to some degree, strangely enough Albert. The sole reason being that these are the only two characters on screen for more than twenty minutes, forcing the audience to sympathise with them. By the end of the film, it is fair to say, that a lump was forming at the back of my throat, although no tears were shed due to the plots predictability. War Horse, however, did achieve an emotional response from me.While discussing emotional scenes within the film I should briefly mention an execution of two German deserters. Being a 12A, War Horse cannot show murder directly on camera. Spielberg expertly edits this execution scene, to meet the films desired rating, by utilising a windmill's rotating blades to briefly block the audience's view of the two German soldiers as they are killed. This shot was hauntingly spectacular. Another memorable scene within War Horse occurs three quarters of the way through, after the horse has become tangled in a large amount of barbed wire in no-mans land. This scene creates a great comical breather in an otherwise ominous film. A German soldier and a British solider attempt to free the horse from its cage, and both get into a reasonable and down-to-earth conversation, along with humorous contribution from their fellow soldiers in the trenches.Finally I cannot finish this review without mentioning the fantastic talents of Tom Hiddleston and Benedict Cumberbatch as a British Captain and Major. Their characters are two of the most important, in my opinion, as it is them that release the horse into war. Both actors play their parts fantastically, creating a captivating beginning to the World War I aspect of War Horse. A much needed entertainment after the first thirty minutes of slugging predictability.War Horse has a slow and tedious beginning but dramatically improves after the horse's involvement in World War I. Jeremy Irvine's acting ability lets the film down, even with the fantastic performances of Hiddleston, Cumberbatch, Arestrup and Mullan. But all in all, the film was entertaining and emotionally attaching, even with the mentioned faults. Another successful block-buster for Spielberg to add to his collection, even if it doesn't measure the likes of Jurassic Park (Dir. Steven Spielberg, 1993), E.T: The Extra-Terrestrial (Dir. Steven Spielberg, 1982) and Indiana Jones and the Raiders of the Lost Ark (Dir. Steven Spielberg, 1981).If you enjoyed this review check out my others at my blog: http://dalelawsonreviews.tumblr.com/",War Horse
229,fatsamuraireviews,The horse that would not quit,8,1 February 2012,"The trailer for this film lets you know you're in for an epic emotional journey. Surprisingly, it does not give away anything about the film. I went in thinking that I had seen all of the good parts. I was so wrong. This movie has so much more than just the surface story. There are elements of family, war, pain and hope. It's an intertwining of two stories during WWI: the horse's journey and that of the boy. It's an interesting study of the relationships the horse creates during the journey of the film. This movie is a green light film for its uplifting story about an indomitable spirit. Out of all of the horse movies I have seen this one is now my favorite.For more on this review go to http://fatsamuraireviews.blogspot.com/",War Horse
230,hughjman,Lovely as a children's movie; maybe too many mawkish coincidences for adults,7,29 June 2021,"My rating on this movie varies according to whether I view it as a children's movie or an adult film. As a movie for older children (say, 8 and up), I think it's lovely. I think it's a wonderful representation of the human-animal bond (which I'm a sucker for) and of devotion. BUT you should watch it before your child does, because there are some upsetting things. As an adult film, it's still lovely (again, depending if you're a sucker for the animal-human bond like I am) but in the last third there are a number of totally unbelievable coincidences and behaviors. I still enjoyed it, though.One haunting scene was the horse being scared to death and running wildly amid bullets, fires and bombs. I think it was a brilliantly different way to portray the horror of battle -- through the horse's eyes.I think it was a children's book. I don't know if the film was marketed for children or adults. But even if it's more for children, I was still very moved at some moments. So 9 for an older kids' movie, 7 for adults (especially those with pets they love).",War Horse
231,zeller-5,"weeeheeeheeeheee (all speak English, regardless of where we come from)",3,31 January 2012,"Oh my.Checking ""contains spoiler"" didn't really feel right. This movie is so predictable that I don't really want to call it a spoiler, unless the watcher is really simple-minded.But okay, to sum it up for everybody and save you some time:great score and beautiful images, amazing cinematography - everything else sucksAct 1: Horsey-Horse (let's call him that instead of Joey) is born on a lonesome field where everybody speaks island-English. Somehow-but-not-really-protagonist-boy is totally amazed by that horse. His drunk-ass dad makes a stupid decision to buy the fancy horse instead of a worker. Boy teaches fancy horse to plough (yes, ACTUALLY plough, not what you think) anyways and proves everybody wrong. Hooray for Horsey. 1914 - WAR! Horsey-Horse has to go be a war-horse, because the harvest failed and drunk-ass dad and his family had to make money somehow.Act 2: Soldier has bought Horsey from Boy and promises to bring him back. Horsey even makes friends (Black-Horsey). The British try to ambush the Germans (that speak English amongst one another for some reason), Soldier gets killed, because the Germans where expecting the 'ambush'. Horsey and Black-Horsey both get taken by 'ze jerr-mins'.Act 2.1: Horsey and Black-Horsey have to answer to the Germans now. Some weird sub-story about two German deserters is told, horses get left behind at some farm in France (where everybody speaks English amongst one another) and grand-pa and grand-daughter - aka people with french accents - enjoy Horsey and Black-Horsey for a while.Act 2.2: Horsey and Black Horsey get re-captured by the people with the German accents. English must have been THE language in the early 1900s. Must have been great not to need any translators. Europe - everybody speaks English with weird accents. Horsey manages to escape again, but Black-Horsey gets left behind. I spare you the dramatic crap wrapped around it.Act 2.3: Meanwhile, Somehow-but-not-really-protagonist-boy had joined the British army and fights in a trench. Good for him. Now guess what: You're thinking 'They didn't - seriously?' The answer is 'No, not yet' :) Horsey, who is now a German deserter, gets caught up in the middle of the British and the German trench. Barb-wire. Horsey is hurt and can't move. A German and a British soldier decide to free Horsey from the barb-wire. They get along, share some tools, free Horsey and throw a coin to decide who gets to keep him. They shake hands, good riddance, kill you later, my friend. At least the German wasn't called 'Hans'. They return to their trenches and suddenly the war is over.Act 3: Somehow-but-not-really-protagonist-Boy hurt his eyes in the field, so he's blind-folded and he can't see... One British soldier wants to kill Horsey, because he's of no use to them. A special whistle makes Horsey come to his original owner - he recognized him of course even though he was blind-folded - and everybody is happy to have the two re-united - But not for long! Horsey belongs to the British army now. French-accent-guy (Act 2.1) buys Horsey for an incredibly high price. And hands him back to his original owner because he realizes that those two belong together. Oh my f. god.Horsey and Somehow-but-not-really-protagonist-Boy (Albert, btw.) return home, everybody hugs, everybody is happy, movie is finally over.In short: I can't really grasp the targeted audience here. It's somehow for 14-year-old girls, but it's also kind of a war movie (in which everybody speaks English). Let's just say, it's probably for underachieving 17- to 20-year-old girls. Don't know if that was intended.'All quiet on the western front' meets toughness-enhanced 'Seabiscuit'.Reviewing my review before posting it, I realize that I can't think of anything plot-related that I missed...

232,SciFiSheriff,A modern epic with the feel of a vintage classic!,10,14 May 2012,"Movies about horses never really appeal to me which is the main reason why I didn't go see this movie. And yet again I am constantly reminded of that old saying, ""Never judge a book by the cover""...This is my review on War Horse.The plot goes like this; It's 1914. A faming family is on the brink of bankruptcy as the drunken farmer Ted Narracott comes home from market after spending all his money on a weak,unstable horse not suitable for ploughing. With Mrs Narracott breaking into deep distress their son Albert swears that he will look after and train the horse at all costs. During this time he grows deeply attached to the creature, communicating to him like he was a human being. When War suddenly breaks lose in Europe, The drunken depressed father has no choice but to sell the horse to a solider. although Albert is very distressed, he agrees to let his horse go to war and vows that he will meet him again. However, during the terror of war, the horse is passed on from person to person, each with there own views on the horse. But as the terror of war jeopardises the horse will he ever find a way home?War horse is based of the British novel of the same name and, since i have not read the novel, I cannot make comparisons. But how was it as a stand-alone film?Lets start with the acting. The farmer's son Albert is brilliantly played by Jeremy Irvine, and for his first sliver screen performance he makes an excellent job. He plays his part full of emotion and energy that is absent in most actors today. He plays some outstanding scenes with the leading horse and you REALLY feel the bond between them (He REALLY loves that horse). You don't see him as much as you would think but his performance is something spectacular. Other roles include British legends Benedict Cumberbatch and Tom Hiddleston who only have minor roles but are still absolutely stunning. They both share some fantastic quotes that are among the best in movie history. These include Cumberpatch's be brave speech. When you watch it, a burst of patriotism fills you body with a great feeling. Call me weird but that is how I felt.The story is a bottomless pit of depth, honour and good old fashioned storytelling. I was contently blown away by the awe-inspiring cinematography and camera angles truly did the film justice, bringing the film to life. Yes the film has it's slow parts especially halfway through but it is hard to mark down a film on something it needs to be in order to be great. For the most part, there isn't many battle scenes and when they do happen they aren't as wide scale as most films of this genre but I don't believe that is what Spielberg wanted; and it works for it's benefit. I will give it credit though- It was loud, fast paced and Adrenalin rushing which is all a battle scene needs to be. showing the true brutality of war, war horse really lives up to it's title as it really places the horse in the gruesome war it was as if it really happened. What could passably top great acting, story, duologue and cinematography? The Music. The soundtrack is written by the movie composing legend, John Williams, that brought us the Jurrassic park theme and the Star Wars Suite. But this soundtrack is by far his best work yet. Never once does the film disappoint in the musical department with scores ranging from bright and cheery to loud and booming. The main theme heard in the trailer is probably my favourite musical score to date- period.To round up, War horse is brilliantly directed by the master Steven Spielberg. Acting and story has never been so deep and beautiful, almost bringing a tear to the eye each time you watch. War horse has a feel-good ending that will stay with you for the rest of the week. War horse has got to be one of the best modern movies ever made and it gets my highest grade, a 10/10.",War Horse
233,UnknownRealmsDotNet,Stunning visuals can't save this lame horse,5,27 August 2012,"Spielberg's skill and some outstanding cinematography isn't enough to save this lame horse. And it is the story behind the problems. With a simplistic sentimentality, and heavy-handed construction, it is as if this was written for children. The thing is, stories of war aren't for children. And while the concept is great, most of the 'tales' of the people around this horse aren't very unique, interesting or even related to a general theme. The second act could almost be cut out of the film. It's a shame because the production values are top notch, and there are some truly memorable visual scenes (in the fields of wheat and the last shots of the film). Unfortunately, a film is more than just pretty pictures. It should be a good story as well.",War Horse

It doesn't really do it as a film aimed at adults and I'm pretty sure the audience the book was aimed at will get totally bored very quickly with the ponderous first half.",War Horse

This is a very touching, heartfelt movie. It's amazing how many lives this horse impacts, and how much he is cared about by so many different people.

It is moving, yet heart warming tale, and follows to the book very well.It is not only good in the sense of a story of courage and love, but also a shocking insight into the truth of World War 1. It just feels so realistic, and it looks like that as well. It's hard to describe how much has been put into the scenery, the uses of machinery and clothing etc... All is accurate to the time of The Great War.Character development is brilliant. (SPOILERS COMING UP) As the horse moves from owner to owner, every one of them is different, and special in their own way. even if they are on the screen for less than 5 minutes, we get an incredible insight into their lives. They express their own feelings for the horse, whether they be a good guy or a bad guy. This is on of the main things that makes this film so unique (MORE SPOILERS COMING UP) I have only one criticism, and that is that the start dragged on a little. But after a while, the story really gets going.Spielburg, you have one me over. This is right up there with my favourite films of all time, I just love it.

(I suspect the latter)I honestly Never in my life have spent so many minutes in tears watching a movie and I watch a Lot of movies. (Luckily I was alone!)It's hard to say anything specific about the movie without spoiling some of it, but suffice it to say that even the horse cannot be classified as the only hero of the movie. There are many heroes, and villains, and misguided and inspired characters coming and going in the film. The horse does remain the binding factor between the people. But the effect on me, the effect of the photography and the score and the story line, was this normal visceral effect that beloved brave noble beast stories always have on certain people. And for such people I believe this will have the most powerful such effect they have ever experienced in a movie theater.Obviously the scope is massive, but it's all used to story-effect here. Every production penny was well spent. I predict this film will leap up high and fast. It's no secret that there's a war in here (WWI), an up- front and bloody mess of a war.

Any complaints for this picture that come out are from a form of not being a fan of certain ways this film is. It does have cheesy elements at the start and gets more serious and touching throughout. Some of the scenes here, I will never forget and stand alone as classic moments on their own. It is deserving of any award nomination it gets.

The story line is simple but effective. Some reviewers didn't like it and it won't win a Nobel prize in literature, but it was about right for my son and I liked it. This movie shows the tragedy of war at a level that a normal 10 year old boy can digest. The action is Spielberg and very welcome. All the actors earn their big paychecks.

241,mayurdeepz,Visually stunning & unabashedly emotional,8,5 February 2012,"Continuing my trend of the Oscar mania, I review Stephen Spielberg's ""War Horse"". First of all for the one's who are not aware, the movie is based on a children's novel by Michael Morpurgo, published in 1982. And as some reports suggest, the film also uses elements of the critically acclaimed, award-winning stage adaptation that opened in London in 2007.WHAT WORKS : Beautiful, absolutely ravishing imagery of country sides, with lush green wide spreads punctuated with abundant dosage of emotional overdrive. A war ravaged gloom dawns upon, better part of the second half but not as much to elaborate on the gore of such acts, but as a tool to tell a story that constitutes the plight of animals of such times. And obviously a beautiful beast, the thoroughbred, the horse, who as the name suggests is the protagonist of the show. The movie works on many levels, with special mention to the look of it. Every frame is a carefully manicured garden, both posh in colour and rich in content. The camera work, much like any Spielberg production is compelling and shouts out loud that a lot of work has gone into achieving what they have. More so, when You consider an animal carrying the narrative through to the end. Not the first time and wont be the last. But as I have always believed, its the manner that determines the outcome. & in this instance, the journey of one Joey (the horse), is a story well told. Some of the negative reviews to a certain degree is justified but one should understand that a movie based on a celebrated children's book means its aimed at such viewers or by and large – the family. And as such, does a wonderful job with its straight forward linear, easy to comprehend story line. Pretty much sums up the reasons why A.I. did not fare as much as half of what E.T. did. On that front alone Spielberg's work should be given its due, for as many great thinkers and directors there maybe in contemporary cinema, his clarity of objective and the means to achieve them, is second to none.WHAT DOESN'T : As I must have mentioned above, War Horse has all the ingredients to be a critic's delight specially for the naysayers. As it has everything that can be debated when looked through a cynic's eyes. It is the beautifully grilled turkey on Your table at ""thanks giving"", the one that in all fairness cannot be enjoyed without using a knife and a fork on it. But it should be remembered for what it stands for : an epitome of the occasion. Nevertheless, I always try to treat a movie as someone who loves the art for what it is before anything else, and I say there are a few points that could be reviewed under a darker light. The beginning could have been more compelling with sometime spent on Albert's fascination for the horse. & the ending could have done without a fairy tale conclusion. No I am not saying a positive end is debatable, its the string that connects the culmination with the climax that I have a problem with. You ought to watch it to understand what I am referring to. But having said all that, these are extremely minor glitches.FINAL WORD : It is without a shred of doubt one of the year's best. The 3rd act before the climax will have You tears so be prepared for it. Steven Spielberg should be lauded for his efforts for staying away from the blood and the gore in his quest at achieving parallel acceptance. But then considering that was not his aim and the reason why this movie will not win the Best Picture is what makes this a fantastic palpable experience. Watch it for the breath taking frames of a stark disposition it offers through an abundant harvest that is ""life"", on one side and what we make of it through mistakes like ""war"", on the other.Read it here http://mayurdeep.com",War Horse

243,gareth-91,hmph,2,15 January 2012,"really irritating film. Too long. OK, so dad is an old war hero with PTSD, as Emily kindly explains to us - he just always looks like a bunny caught in the headlights. Handsome son is so good he makes me puke, no tit mags for him. Emily is as ever Mrs Stoic, is this the only role she plays - a gentle tearing-up. Bad land-owner is modern capitalist banker fat cat, who taunts people's weaknesses. Handsome boy's learning disabled friend keeps going in about how great friend is. They piled it on with a shovel, a trowel and then a spoon. There were no real people just caricatures of people. The army bloke who took the horse was quite sweet, he quite liked horses at least. I liked some of the German lads who were farm boys and good with horses. Liked the French grandpa and his granddaughter was charming, at least she had some spirit, probably looked at tit mags.The goose (or was it a duck) was nice - at least it had some character.The horses of course were lovely, but then horses are - apart from the ones that kick and bite. It felt a bit of a waste of my time all in all. Millions of boys being sent to their death by the dicks in charge, nothing changed there then. A good old war movie, and the point?",War Horse

A litmus test for an audiences boredom is when the mobiles start being turned on and you can see the lights of them flashing.I counted about 10 in the cinema I was in ,after about 45 minutes into the film.

245,fidraisle-1,I really wanted to like this film.,1,8 June 2014,"I'm what is known as an animal lover. More specifically, I love horses. ""Secretariat""? I cried buckets. ""Seabiscuit""? Ditto. I'd seen the magnificent puppetry involved in ""War Horse"" in the theatres in London, I was mesmerized by it (I have seen the examples of the puppetry, without seeing the play itself). So I braced myself when it came on Netflix. I knew I was going to cry my eyes out. Time and again, I thought of watching it, but I could not bring myself to put myself through the emotional turmoil. Last night, there was nothing on the terrestrial television channels, so my husband put on War Horse. Up front, I will say, the music is very good, as is the costuming (I study costuming, so that's usually my first complaint). The story? Not so good. I felt it jumped about too much to be enjoyable. (This might work in the theatre, but not so well in cinema). The relationship between Albert and Joey (really? JOEY? Could he not have come up with a better name than that?)I didn't buy at all. Clearly, this lad had no clue about horses (a bit odd, considering he was a farmer at the turn of the century). Having schooled a horse, I can tell you, the first thing you need, and that's to be smarter than the horse, and from the film, I don't feel that was the case. ""Oh I know what will be smart, I'll teach the horse to respond to a common bird call."" The poor horse (a nervous and hot blooded thouroughbred) would have been a nervous wreck within a week. A girl appears for no apparent reason. She gets mentioned again later, but as the rich chap who was squiring her around in his automobile couldn't remember her name, we don't know either. She should have been named Emily, to resonate with the French girl with a similar name, but no, we weren't given any information about her at all. To be blunt, this film was all ""fur coat and no knickers"", promised much, and delivered very little. I wanted to like it, I wanted to fall madly in love with it, I wanted to weep salt tears over it. All I felt when it was over was relief.",War Horse

I had no need to worry. The whole thing was beautifully handled and even the filming of the trenches and the front were carefully composed and lit. Joey the horse is the lead actor. And what an actor! What a handsome horse! He certainly stole the film. Some scenes stay with me. The race with the car, the friendship with the black horse, the Geordie regiment bagpipe player in the trench, the German soldiers helping the worn out horses drag those great guns up the slope. Joey bolting through the barbed-wire fencing. A friend I was with remarked afterwards that Roses of Picardy had not been written in 1914 and that the record it was being played on was from about three decades later. These are really small details in what appeared to me to be a meticulously researched film. I hope it has a world wide audience. It deserves one.",War Horse
247,jcsuperjake,"An entertaining film, however",7,28 December 2011,"I was quite entertained when I saw this movie. It was quite slow at parts though. I do not know if I was antsy or if it was the movies because I drank a lot of diet coke.War Horse is about a 'miraculous' horse, going from family to family in Britain, while they are at war. The first war that is, not the second. There were not many standouts in this movie, as it seemed like every five minutes, the horse would go to a different family. I do not remember a time when this movie did not have music playing in the background. I think the music played throughout he whole film. It was really good music too. Very well thought out and all. I do wanna say that if you are a horse lover and wanna go see this movie, well, lets just say you might be screaming at the movie screen, or gasping or crying. This movie can be tough for some viewers. The movie has some good humor, including a scene towards the end with a British soldier and a German. I was entertained by this movie, however, I did expect more from it.",War Horse
248,ryokan_wc,Joey wins big.,7,2 March 2012,"What caught my attention most was the title of the movie. War. Horse. Enough said, and my mind went wild with imagination. I saw little trailer and avoided reviews of the movie, but i knew this movie has been nominated for 7 awards. And directed by Steven S. So there came the expectation.In short, this movie is about the love and loyalty between a horse and its owner. At the beginning, i was introduced to the horse, Joey, and Joey was trained and cared by Albert (played by Jeremy I). Albert's father won the bid for the horse in which he thought the horse was special. But because his father could not pay rent, the horse was 'loaned' to the then English army to serve in the war.The plot thickened with the horse playing the lead role, and his life story traveled three-sixty. I felt like the horse was cursed, that whoever was with Joey suffered a misfortune. But in another perspective, we saw bravery and courage of those with Joey- like the man riding to his death, brothers in an escape attempt and a young, innocent girl. It was until Albert reached his legal age to serve in the army, he enlisted himself and began his quest in search of his beloved horse.This movie is pure drama, at its best. It has a strong cast and a great setting. Expecting it as a drama movie, there are times when my heart raced through the scenes, and there are times which the movie mellowed down for development.One of my favourite scenes of the movie was the war scene- explosions and gunfire. It was brilliantly captured and frankly, one of the best war scenes in movies. While war points at the weakness of man's humanity, this movie shed light on the power of a horse to unite two parties, even if it might mean temporary. A strong message.I thought, as a human-animal relationship story, that i would tear up at the end of the movie. But thankfully, i didn't. The movie was moving and it touched straight to the heart, but it was inspiring with a happy ending. The love and loyalty between Albert and Joey are difficult to be expressed in words here, that only in the movie do you really get to see them shine- even the eyes were not needed to recognize.",War Horse

250,nep983,War Horse,10,7 January 2012,I saw this film with my family and I was very excited as I entered the theater. The beginning of the film is a little slow but later on everything starts to speed up a little. The performances were good from the actors but nothing that deserves awards sadly. As this film is mostly about the horse Joey and his ordeals through WWI. Parts of the film were very emotional and also made me cry. Spoiler Alert Spoiler Alert STOP READING Please stop reading I don't want to ruin it for you The end of the film with the red sunset was beautiful and one of best scenes of the movie.Steven Speilburg has made a great and wonderful film that I highly recommend seeing.

251,henry_yan,Humanity amidst the carnage,10,30 December 2011,"There is a dearth of films about the First World War, and as a recreational history freak, I could never quite understand why the stories of that brutal period of human history were not brought to the big screen more often. Perhaps the box office does not take kindly to an era that seems so long ago.This is one of the most moving film I have seen in a long long time. Acclaimed director Steven Spielberg has painstakingly assembled an ensemble cast who delivered the most compelling performance of the year. Jeremy Irvine plays Albert, the farmboy who forms an immediate and instinctive relationship with the lead character of the story, a gorgeous thoroughbred whom he named ""Joey"". As his family fell on hard times, Albert's father was forced to sell Joey to a British Army officer, Captain Nicholls in preparation for frontline action in World War I. As the film progresses, Joey's ownership is passed from one person to another until it comes full circle back to Albert again.This film contains many heart wrenching scenes. To mention all would be unfair to the reader. However, the one scene which left me with a lump of my throat was the part when Joey was trapped in barbed wire in the middle of no-man's land. A British soldier, Collins, his compassion stirred by the sight of an animal in pain, goes against orders and goes over his trench (it's suicide to even lift your head up) to free Joey. What makes this scene outstanding was that a German soldier was equally moved by his compassion to move out of his line to free the horse. Throughout the rescue, the two supposed adversaries conversed like chums in a pub, united by their inner humanity to free a trapped animal. At the end of the rescue when ownership went to Collins at the coin toss, Collins called the German soldier ""Fritz"", who then replied ""my name is not Fritz, it's Peter"". It shows that amidst the brutality of war, at the ground, there is humanity on both sides. It was a very moving scene indeed.Hence, I would strongly urge you to see this film. It is a perfect tonic for the holiday, and a inspiration to what may be a troubled year ahead.",War Horse

It is not for the faint of heart or for people that can't handle tragedy about horses (did not give anything away).

254,Stoh80,"An exciting adventure, a heartfelt story",8,14 May 2012,"When I went to go see this film, I have to say I did not have very high expectations. Directed by Steven Spielberg and taking place in 1914, it is about a young English farm boy who befriends a horse whom he names Joey. I thought that it was going to be a somewhat cheesy, boring movie filled with clichés about the power of love and friendship. And, for the first 30 minutes, I was right. But, while the beginning was rather slow and uneventful, it was definitely worth it, as it set up what was to come next.When the family has to sell Joey to the British army to fight the war going on the European mainland, the movie takes on a whole new tone. Death and violence fill nearly every scene. To my knowledge, other than the classic All Quiet on the Western Front, not many movies go into depth about World War I the way War Horse did. It shows the way German, English, and French troops and civilians lived while the First World War raged on, without making one side the ""good guys"" and the other the ""bad guys."" I applaud the movie for getting the historical accuracies of this grim war right, while at the same time still making it interesting and relatable for someone who may not be a history buff.The music score, done by John Williams, was amazing and always matched with the mood of the scene. The cinematography was great, and the editing and camera angles worked to make the movie flow perfectly. The special effects, costumes of the actors, and setting/props were excellently done. As far as the technical aspect goes, I was engrossed the entire time, and not once did I feel like it was fake or cheaply done. Of course, as it was Spielberg, no expenses were spared in visually impressing the audience, and yet it never seemed too over-the-top.Overall, this was a pretty good movie, and I was happy that I went to see it. At over 2 hours, it was kind of long, but it didn't seem to drag on. The plot was very well executed, and though it began slow, it did not feel like as if there were any unnecessary scenes or characters making it stagnant. This is definitely a movie that you have to actively watch and become involved in, and casually watching it would not make it as satisfying. As both a heartfelt film and an exciting, violent war movie, it was very well done.",War Horse
255,TheHighVoltageMessiah,A Love Story,8,14 January 2012,"Steven Spielberg's ""War Horse"" begins with shots of ravishing beauty, gliding across the gold and green lushness of the countryside. But with the coming of the Great War, the colors fade. It becomes a film of muted browns and grays, well befitting life in the trenches.It is the story of a horse, Joey, swept up by the war. Yet it is equally the story of the humans he encounters. It is the story of the young man who trains him and is forced to see him sold away, the story of two boys who find their brotherly bond stronger than their orders and the threat of death. It tells of the compassion of an anguished German soldier whose duties are to tend horses that endure unspeakable labors. And in one of its most poignant sections, it shows a bright-eyed girl and her grandfather whose lives will be splintered by tragedy and ravaged by the war In one way or another, these characters – all of them good souls – are inescapably caught in the senseless, horrific conflict.Nonetheless, Spielberg has stated that his film is not a war film but a love story, an assertion that many will apply to the relationship between Joey and his first owner, Albert. But it is just as applicable to any episode mentioned above. Love is the uniting cord that weaves together this series of events. It is shown in the muck of the trenches by soldiers to each other as they struggle to survive the anarchy of battle or the swirling phantasm of gas. It is seen in the grandfather's fierce and devoted protection of his granddaughter. Also, it is evident that Albert's mother (played beautifully by Emily Watson) holds her husband close to her heart and still has some strength to have faith in him despite the mistakes of his past.War is ever in the background, even penetrating scenes where there is no sign of fighting. At the film's heart, however, is love, as Spielberg has said – love not just between human and horse but between human and human, love for the whole of mankind. No matter their side in the war, characters are depicted with the same amount of sympathy. It is a vast, all-encompassing love that extends to both man and beast, transcending the boundaries of the battlefield.",War Horse
256,vigihawk,"War Horse: 5 stars, 2 hankies",9,27 January 2012,"This is the combined comments of two military historians:Just saw War Horse. Nicely plotted, excellent characters/cast, beautifully filmed. Critics say that Spielberg manipulates the audience emotions. Well duh! Ya think? Sheesh. Anyway, it's likely the teariest hoss film since Smoky with Fred MacMurray (about the time I was born.) MUCH Western Front detail: I don't know a lot of WW I grunt rivet-counter stuff but saw nothing to fault. Especially liked a minor character, the savvy Indian NCO who scouted the Hun positions. Favorite line: ""Time spent on reconnaissance is seldom wasted."" That's straight out of the Brit Army Manual...As usual w/SS, it's too long at nearly 2.5 hrs. I kept looking at my watch, knowing that a plot point would occur at 45 minutes. The prewar stuff could've been condensed to 30 minutes w/out a problem. Took child bride on Friday. Concur in ratings. But they're guy sniffles in bandanas, not hankies. Some classic Spielberg touches: gritty battle field, an almost monochrome sunset scene and the snow. Only objections (besides not even one aeroplane) were no-mans land too narrow and cluttered and his flaming trees. Good effect, but how much can one tree burn?Heard that it took 15 trained horses--each-- to do all the stunts for the two equine stars.Browsed IMDb about the actors and cept for some minor parts in Harry Potter fliks whole bunch of unknowns, but they sure were good.SPOILERS FOLLOWThe Brit cavalry attacking the hunnish encampment from the wheat field meets 0.00 resistance until the Germans flee into the tree line....where there be Maxims. An outraged Hun officer berates the newly-captured Brit colonel: ""Did you think we would leave an open encampment undefended? What kind of people do you think we are?"" When in fact a skookum Hunnish Offizier would've had some Emma Gees between the camp and an obvious line of approach.The film viscerally demonstrates the wastage among horses. People don't know that in WW II the Heer was at least 40% horse-drawn so obviously it was moreso in Round One. Definitely not a date/chick flick in that regard.Also liked that the little French maiden and the redhead in the auto did not turn into some ticky-tacky romantic ending.",War Horse
257,Tricycle_Thief,Sentimental pulp. Slushy goop for the gullible.,1,23 January 2017,"It's a truism to say: 'Never let the facts spoil a good story' - but to ignore facts completely is to write fantasy, not fiction - this film is fantasy.And the best actor was the horse - should have been given an Oscar . . . .It started out well - just the first 10 minutes - but after that the story showed little recognition of reality in any form. It is a shallow fairy tale - not even one with any clear moral worthy of nearly two hours of woolly moralising.Early on, there was mention of 'The Imperial Yeomanry'- potentially a great 'seed' for the following story, but utterly wasted - and even at the end of the film its relevance remained undiscovered. The vagueness seems to suggest that either the author or screenwriter were rather out of their depth regarding the Second Boer War and just flailing around at a deeper story that tamped through the Great War. All we had as a thread was some barely seen pennant which miraculously stayed with the horse through the unfolding story, but which carried no weight in it. So much more could have been made of that angle.Situations were created simply in order to be resolved in a emotionally jerky way, but also to reinforce stereotypes and received wisdom about WW1.The British Cavalry charge is a nonsense - no army camp is defended by a row of machine guns behind them. Anyway, since the Boer Wars the British Cavalry was principally used for scouting and mobile skirmishing (mounted infantry) and used rifles - sword wielding cavalry charges was retained just for later gullible film directors.However, if you are gonna have B. Cumberbatch in the film you have to give him something grand and patently foolhardy to do.The Germans hardly ever shot deserters in the field in WW1: that was something that the British occasionally did but which usually involved a 'proper' Court Martial on both sides. In contrast, a horse, injured and trapped in No-Man's Land would more likely have been peremptorily shot.Towards the end of the film, 'Grandpere' buys the ""miracle horse"" - it being the same one his grand-daughter briefly ""owned"". Quite how he found out about it 40 minutes later in the film involves a big leap of faith - or willful blindness - by the audience . . . .The true stories about war horses are much more engaging - and sobering.",War Horse
258,fellow456,Possibly Spielberg's Worst Movie,4,10 March 2013,"Pros: Steven Spielberg. War movie.Cons: I don't mean the above in some sort of, ""That's all that needs to be said"" mentality. That's actually all that can be said. Only the above is still misleading. When I say ""Steven Spielberg,"" I mean that someone traveled back to the 1950's to find a Spielberg still in grade school who does not yet know how to identify good plots or scripts or make them into good movies, and then had him make this movie. And when I say ""war movie,"" I mean that if any war was in this movie, I guess that part ended up on the cutting room floor. When it finished, my roommate Jeff asked, ""Did I just watch a PG war movie?"" No, Jeff. Somehow, against all odds, this movie stumbled its way into a PG-13 rating. My guess is that the more severe rating was the result of, ""Contains no rainbows or lollipops. Allusions to violence and less happy places.""I'm sorry, but I need to take a moment here. The fact that Spielberg directed this movie is really hurting my heart. Since the 80's, if he wasn't making movies that will literally change your life upon watching (e.g. Saving Private Ryan, Schindler's List), he was at least making movies that were endlessly fun to watch (e.g. Indiana Jones, Jurassic Park). Seriously, look at his directing filmography. Seven of my forty favorite movies had Spielberg at the helm. And the rest (that I've seen) are at least highly rated, if not top rated. So why the hell did he make this movie? It's killing me. No matter how many times I check the IMDb page, his name is still right there, under ""director.""The horse is the character that you care about the most, which I guess is the point. The problem is that the previous statement really isn't saying much, and I actually worded it wrong. What I meant to say was, ""The horse is the only character that you care about at all."" The whole movie attempts to be one big stab at sentimentality, but it falls flat on its face, because sentiment is best saved for, you know, things that you care about.I'm pretty sure the only reason this movie got any positive press (and... *sigh*... an Oscar nomination) is because it's about a horse, which apparently gives it some sort of credibility. If you were to take the exact same plot, characters, script, and actors, but replace the horse with another, less traditionally revered animal, it almost certainly would be laughed out of every movie house in existence.Separated by war. Tested by battle. Bound by friendship... War Goat.Overall: The best that I can say for it is that I never really looked at the clock. But I'm pretty sure at this point that the main reason I never looked was because I was waiting with baited breath for this to turn into a Spielberg movie (i.e. a movie that I enjoy watching). Right up to the moment when the screen turned black for the closing credits, I was convinced that Spielberg was just toying with me, and that the good part of the movie was right around the corner. Then the closing credits came, followed by all those copyright things at the very end for things like Dolby sound and Technicolor, and then the screen went black, and then... Steven Spielberg forced me to disgrace him with a 4 out of 10. I actually think a movie about a goat would have at least been funny at parts.",War Horse

260,neighborlee,Triumphant showcase of bond between man and companion animal amidst the extremes of war,10,6 April 2012,"In full disclosure I must state out of the gate, that I wasn't looking forward to seeing this particular movie, given the feelings of loss I've experienced, so going into this movie carried some unsettling thoughts for me to say the least. Simply put, I've changed over the years, matured, become Vegan due to my love for animals , as my mother before me, and knew going in this was going to be a tear jerker for me, given I""d lost a very special canine months before to Epil-K9. He was a very special canine companion as many are to us, and hence leading into this review of War Horse, I will state one of the most poignant lines in the movie for me at least, was, ' It's a horse not a dog '.War is pretty for no one, sometimes its a necessity at least at our current state of evolution, yet sometimes innocents are hurt. This is a story ,centering yes around a horse but its so much more than that. It encapsulates family values, firmly entrenched in pride , love and enduring faith in outcomes of triumph; A story about the casualties of war, through the lens of a companion animal, in this case a horse, whereby spins a tale of hard work, sacrifice , great struggle and triumph, leading the audience through a journey of emotions as swift and varying as is the struggle of men and women, and yes horses too, as fate weaves through their lives. I've never seen war personally due mostly to my age, but age has no barrier to entry in this movie as relates to the heart it imparts to your soul, for showcasing the ravages war can extract; yet through hope , courage and enduring faith , the bond between man and animal made stronger . Through wonderful acting, period backdrops and props and a stunning score , accompanied by a wonderful script based on a thought provoking book, we have a journey very worth embarking on .War Horse won't break your heart,- it won't bring you to your knees enthralled by thunderous non stop action and special effects galore, but it will ask you to ponder two words as they relate to each other from the point of view of what really matters in life. Do we continue to engage the world from the lens of continued war and animal negligence , or do we follow a different path where man works together for common causes of hunger , technology and advancement, and treat other species whom share this planet with us with the same respect , as many religions teach us, that we ask and want for ourselves. This is a movie that celebrates what is wonderful and right about the immutable bond between human and companion animal, and isn't afraid to showcase it in ways that make us contemplate doing better.",War Horse
261,msmith5484,Spielberg's misplaced manipulation,4,18 January 2012,"Every film maker manipulates. They have a point of view they want the audience to share. Steven Spielberg has the ability to tell a story very well, but when he gets overly sentimental his films fail. Maybe this is an example of loving something too much. Instead of a whisper, he's screaming ""Feel this!!, Love this!!"" I don't need to be beaten over the head. Also, it seems like they were trying to make a movie that would appeal more to kids. Or maybe Spielberg doesn't trust the American audience, that's why all the actors spoke English except with vague German or French accents. The characters were fairly one-dimensional so I was never fully attached to any of them. I also didn't feel any of the tension that was supposed to be there either during the battle scenes or the auction scenes. And the scene with the British and German soldiers freeing Joey from the barbed-wire and developing a bond should have been so much more. The film looked beautiful for the most part, the colors were rich and full and looked like a Technicolor film at it's best, although there were times with the lighting, that you could tell someone was off camera with a reflector shining light on the actors faces. This could have been a truly great story of love, loss, honor and bravery, but got lost because Spielberg forgets to treat his audience like thinking adults and plays too much to the heart.",War Horse

263,rogapol,Donkey of a Flick,1,2 September 2012,"Unfortunately I wasted 2 and a half hours of my Saturday evening watching this tripe of a movie. Why on earth would Spielberg, a great movie director, want to spent millions of his and others hard earned dollars to bother making a movie about a horse.In reality horses don't seem to show too many facial expressions or have much body language and that was proof in War Horse. For example have you ever seen a how a horse reacts after winning an equestrian, winning a major horse race event or slogging it out in the field? I could see how Spielberg was trying to get the audience to connect with Mr Horse through a rather lame storyline, but I have to say it just didn't work for me. I tried to cry for the horse but ended up crying for all the wrong reasons.Don't waste your evening as I did, you'd be better served by watching E.T. on a commercial network than watching a commercial-less version of War Horse.",War Horse

265,ConDeuce,A Boy And His Horse...,7,31 December 2011,"""War Horse"" is a good, solid piece of movie making and since it's directed by Steven Spielberg, what more could anyone expect. It is another movie that people should see in a theater because one of the film's merits is its filmed scale. It's shot in a grand, epic style that we do not see very often anymore and on a home screen (regardless of the size or the stereo system) the effect will be lost. That said, ""War Horse"" is not a great film. It's essentially a ""boy-and-his-horse"" story set against the backdrop of World War I and while Spielberg certainly creates some brilliant sequences (horses pulling a massive German ""gun""), in the end, the movie doesn't ellicit the big, all-encompassing, emotional response that I think he intended (and from what I've read, the play accomplished). The main reason for it is (ironically) because of the horse. If they could give an Academy Award for best animal actor, this horse would win it easily. He was mightily impressive not only in the standard shots but in some reaction shots that were superb. He bonds with another black horse in the film and this relationship became one of the film's most touching aspects. But as good as he was, by focusing our emotions almost entirely on the horse, the other, deeper aspects of the film get pushed to the background. I think ""War Horse"" was supposed to be some kind of rumination on war and the toll it takes on people with the horse aspect acting as a symbol (or a metaphor?) but not intended as the focal point. Since the horse is the focal point in Spielberg's ""War Horse"", the other meanings are lost or at least pushed to the background that they don't resonate after the movie is over. Spielberg doesn't help things at all by staging yet another of his BIG emotional endings and in ""War Horse"" it feels particularly unnecessary. Why-oh-why does Spielberg feel the need to do this in what feels like every single one of his movies since ""E.T.""? As good and at times great as Spielberg is, he is not a sophisticated director who can handle subtle meanings. He's a good mimic but in the end, he always seems to fall back on schmaltz.My giving ""War Horse"" 7 out of 10 is for the film's grand scale, some good performances by the aforementioned horse as well as Jeremy Irvine as the boy Albert, Emily Watson (memorable in a role that could otherwise have been forgotten) and best of all, Tom Hiddleston as Captain Nicholls who takes the horse from Irvine's Albert and promises to take care of him. Hiddleston reminds me of those great British actors like Leslie Howard who were both strong, urbane and human.",War Horse

If you want sleaze, profanity, spurting blood, and big name actors, forget it. IMDb wants more lines in my review, so...I was really impressed by the way this great horse, Joey, is trained and handled, and the adventures he goes through.

267,lilmandecicco,Spielberg was just practicing before this....,10,14 January 2012,"War Horse did not have an all star cast, but what it did have was the richest and most original story for a movie that i ever witnessed. Before you watch this movie i must note that you can try and predict the ending but you will never guess what all actually ends up happening and i have seen all of the endings and this ending had me so shocked and surprised. The last twenty minutes is the whole ending and i'm so glad that Spielberg did not have any blood or gore or swearing or anything in War Horse because War Horse was not about war. It was about how far a bond with an animal can go. A war will certainly always test your limits, but to survive in it; well, you would have to have the right motivation and reason for being there. Albert Narracott had the perfect reason. He finally bonded love with something in his life and it was taken from him. For what? So that his family could make more money than they already had. If anything, this movie taught me how far a bond of love can go with an animal. On opposite sides of war and it still won't matter just as long as you love the animal that you are there to get. I knew, even two weeks before this movie came out in theaters, that I would just adore it, but I never knew that it would be such a masterpiece. Is it at all realistic to go into war just to get your horse back? Probably not, but this shows you how far love can go; no matter if war separates you or even if you're on opposite sides of the world.I don't think they used too much CGI because everything did look real, even the bombs shot up in the air. I may be wrong, but Spielberg did a fantastic job ensuring that this movie was done perfectly.",War Horse
268,mkc1218,"Timeless story, amazing and emotional film",9,16 January 2012,"***SPOILERS***War Horse – a simple story of friendship in an epically scaled film – is lyrically beautiful. The perpetually and poetically moving camera that is the hallmark of Spielberg's visual style is on proud display: sweeping crane shots, long tracking shots, pans and tilts from perfect anglesThis is the work of a man who has mastered like none before the cinematic power of individual shots and the milking of little moments that combine to make emotional sequences.Stylistically, it is THE classic Spielberg film.In terms of story, War Horse is reminiscent of the innocent cinema of another era, as so often other Spielberg films are. Based on the book and play of the same name, War Horse is the story of a boy's friendship with an animal who touches so many over the course of the film with his nobility, courage, selflessness, and spirit. It is a friendship unbroken by time, distance, and ordeal.The story and its themes are timeless. Placed on a big Hollywood canvas by a master director, the film is overwhelmingly and unabashedly emotional.There are few story surprises, no real unexpected twists or turns. And it ends exactly as you thought (hoped) it would; that's the promise the director and writers make to the audience. And quite frankly, that's the nature of man/animal friendship stories. You know what you're getting yourself into before the curtain rises. Set against the backdrop of world war, you have to anticipate good old-fashioned melodrama and happy endings.But that doesn't make the ride any less emotional. If you don't feel something stir inside you while watching War Horse, then see a psychologist. Or better yet, call an ambulance because you are likely dead.The film is masterful and affecting, done by a storyteller who has reached a new height in his craft.",War Horse

270,skipp-5,Make your own mind up,8,23 February 2013,"I saw this at the cinema when it first came out, and then recently purchased the blu-ray. I have also seen the play in London. So I amused myself with the reviews that appear to be either love it or hate it. Equally I noted, although not definite that the hates appear in the main to be from the US and the loves from the UK - although as I say, there are a lot of exceptions. Personally, I absolutely loved this film. It was thought provoking, and in my view extremely well filmed. I also love to learn from a film - I never realised for example, the stupidity of the British in WW1, thinking they could charge with horses and swords against the German machine guns. I also never realised the sheer number of horses slaughtered in WW1. For me the story was reminiscent of something Thomas Hardy may have written, and perhaps therein lies the problem - today's audience has been spoon fed on the craze for 3D with flying objects coming out of the screen and crazy special effects, yet this was a far more gentle film, aimed at the whole family. So I guess you will either love it or hate it, so if you have not seen it, get it out on Blu-ray (not DVD) and make up your own mind",War Horse
271,Filmy2020,Not all books should be made into films,4,12 April 2012,"There is not much good I can say about this film. It is by no means the worst film I have seen. There were parts of it that were captivating for a short while, but it was far from edge of your seat exciting. As for being a family movie, I felt it lacked an appropriate connection with the viewer to be the kind of film that tugs at your heart.The script tends to wave back and forth from dull to cheesy, which makes it difficult to find many of the characters likable or real.Admittedly, the horses in the film are beautiful, and horse enthusiasts may get some enjoyment purely from the animals.The absolute worst part of this film was the cinematography. I don't generally have issues with Spielberg films in this regard, but War Horse really missed the boat here. Many of the back drops looked fake (whether or not they actually were, I'm not sure). The colour filters, terrible outdoor lighting and constant underexposure of the film, even in happier upbeat moments of the film was a constant annoyance and frequently kept me from being completely engrossed in the story, as it was always in my consciousness that I was watching a screen.If you liked the original story, good for you.

There is nothing inherently wrong with being a film so heart-warmingly predictable that the lovey-dovey moments practically ooze out of the audience's preconceived notions of ""Christmas miracle"" and onto the peculiarly blue-eyed lead actor. Still, while watching War Horse something feels uncomfortably wrong. Whether this feeling is rooted within the several leads-- all of whom are more emotionally charged and, regrettably, more talented than Jeremy Irvine-- or in the fact that there is something very ""Hallmark"" about a Spielberg film at this point, I shall never know. Perhaps its the fact that Tom Hiddleston was on for hardly an eighteenth of the film. I don't think I'll be getting an answer very soon. None-the-less, as a whole the film was entertaining and a decent Christmas-feel-good. Worth a watch.",War Horse

The music, the story, the cinematography and the lines are all cheesy! This is considered a drama\war movie, well, watching it it did not feel like either! Not for a second I doubted that it will turn out okay for the boy and the horse and when you stop fighting and decide to free up a horse instead and have a very friendly conversation while doing it,it is kind of hard for the viewers to take the war seriously.

274,busterggi,You've seen it before or so you think,10,14 December 2011,"A friend & I caught a sneak preview last night - it was an amazing ride. I wouldn't have otherwise gone to see this film, its about a boy & his pet - seen this story a dozen times, nothing new right? Wrong!This is truly epic with multiple tightly interwoven subplots that give it a grand analogy feeling. You will love some of the characters and hate others but while there are heroes (in many ways) there are no villains - just people, no two alike, vividly delineated. You will be surprised, probably even shocked at some character's fates. This is not a predictable collection of clichés.The warfare itself is gut-wrenching brutally realistic despite the lack of actual gore, which wouldn't have added anything had it been shown. This is NOT for the little kiddies unless they watched 'Saving Private Ryan' for their 4th birthday. Even the corpse-eating rats are present and they aren't doing any cute musical numbers either.There were a lot of tears shed in the audience in sorrow & in joy and even a beat-up old man like me rode the emotional roller-coaster.Seriously, if you don't want to see another movie about a boy and his pet then see this film, its so much more than that, you'll be sorry if you miss it.",War Horse
275,Bascoda,Black Beauty does World War 1,8,25 December 2011,"Essentially, this film is a do-over of Black Beauty in a WW1 setting - that's your basic story line. People will view the film from two different perspectives, depending on how much they know about horses. Anyone who has ever owned, trained or spent a lot of time around horses will find that a healthy dose of the willful suspension of disbelief is not only helpful, but necessary to enjoying the movie. Getting a horse to agree to do what you want it do in real life is a lot different than what is shown in the movie. That's the downside. The upside is that people familiar with horses will more easily understand the intensity of the bond that can form between a person and a horse. There are some plot holes that require an additional helping of that same suspension of disbelief, but nothing so egregious that it will ruin anyone's overall enjoyment of the film.OK, those are the nit-picks. Now, on to the good stuff. The story is unashamedly sentimental, and a bit corny in spots. This is counterpointed by some pretty intense battle scenes. If nothing else, Mr. Spielberg sure knows how to stage a battle. Not quite as intense as the opening sequence in Saving Private Ryan, but equally impressive. No sides taken here: war itself is the bad guy. The scene where a British soldier and a German soldier named Peter cooperate to free the horse from barbed wire in no man's land has a basis in historical fact. There were documented instances of similar actions (none, to my knowledge, involving a horse) occurring more than once. The casting was excellent and the acting very good. Nothing exceptionally brilliant perhaps, but every character was eminently believable. Composer John Williams has created, as he usually does, a score that does precisely what a movie score is supposed to do: it punctuates and enhances the story line without being intrusive. The art direction and cinematography are superb. I have no idea what the competition will be like when Academy Award time rolls around, but I would bet on War Horse in both of those categories. This is one of those instances where words are inadequate, you have to see it. Overall, I'd say ""try it, you'll like it."" I intend to see it again, probably more than once.",War Horse
276,OzoFriendly,An excellent screen adaptation of an excellent book.,8,25 August 2017,"First off, I will say that I am perfectly happy to spend a couple of hours every once in a while having my emotional buttons pushed, and I'd suggest that no one can do that more reliably than Spielberg. I mention this only because no one should be in any doubt that, settling down to watch War Horse, that is precisely what will happen.I've read a couple of Morpurgo's books - he's very popular with my two girls - so I also know that the story would frame discomforting, even distressing, aspects of humanity in the context of an exciting and engaging story pitched at a young audience. I've no idea how much Sewell's Black Beauty influenced Morpurgo, but War Horse portrays the terrible ordeals animals suffered during WW1 with the same unflinching veracity.Spielberg (with John Williams very much in tow) takes it's audience from the mundane preamble to war in England, through the unspoiled fields of the first shocking skirmishes in France, to the appalling, desperate, deadly struggle between the trenches. There is no jingoism, no great heroism and no judgement. There is, as Kipling lamented, ""but to do or die"" and while War Horse is occasionally violent, it is neither gratuitously so, nor graphic.Unlike the book, which is told from the perspective of the horse, the movie focuses necessarily on the characters whose lives are touched by the horses and how profoundly they are affected by the war. These stories are poignant vignettes and the acting is generally excellent; I thought Tom Hiddleston and Niels Arestrup were particularly good. As protagonists, the horses of the story are granted a measure of anthropomorphism, and this quality is reassuringly restrained; I really liked how naturally the horses behaved in comprehensibly human ways without succumbing to uncanny-valley CGI.I am saddened that so many reviewers seem incensed that they have been manipulated watching this movie; I thought that was the idea. If and when I sit my girls down to watch War Horse, I certainly hope they are. As long as you can forgive the few minutes of excessive schmaltz Spielberg seems to think his audience demands at the end of his movies, War Horse is a very enjoyable and rewarding button-pusher.",War Horse

278,DeniseNY,"Visually Stunning with a Few Flaws, War Horse is a Must-See!",8,3 January 2012,"I had the pleasure of seeing War Horse this weekend and I enjoyed it very much! After reading other reviews, I was a bit hesitant as I was expecting a real cry-fest - and while it really tugs at the heart, I didn't find it as forced as others have said. But by all means, keep those tissues handy! War Horse is a period piece - an epic journey through war-torn Europe during WWI with an immense cast of extras and plenty of horses. The cinematography is incredible with dramatic, sweeping views of rural England as well as the brutal front lines of war. The war scenes themselves are realistic without being too graphic. The score is incredible and really ties the story together. As you watch War Horse, it seems that Spielberg is tipping his hat to the filmmakers of Old Hollywood. Think ""Black Beauty"" meets ""Gone with the Wind"".At the core of it all is the basic story of a boy and his horse. War Horse is an adaption of the best-selling children's novel of the same name by Michael Morpurgo. The first act of War Horse begins when Ted Narracott (Peter Mullan), a struggling farmer, comes home from the horse auction with a young thoroughbred instead of the heavy draft horse that he originally set out to purchase. Young Albert (Jeremy Irvine) falls in love with the horse whom he affectionately names ""Joey"" and a bond between boy and horse is born. Soon thereafter, WWI breaks out and their relationship is abruptly torn apart when Ted is forced to sell Joey to the cavalry in order to pay the rent.The next act follows the epic adventure of Joey as he travels through Europe during WWI. During the course of his journey, Joey experiences the war from both sides of the fence after he and his friend ""TopFlight"" are captured by the Germans during a failed British cavalry charge. As we follow Joey through his travels, he experiences joy, fear, cruelty and death as he touches the lives of the people he meets along the way. There are some rather grim scenes of war including blood and death that - while not graphic - many not be appropriate for youngsters. That being said, the scenes with Joey as he interacts with his friends and environment are amazing. Great attention was paid in giving Joey a real and tangible personality that the audience can see and feel. When Joey is happy, we are happy and laugh with him; when Joey is scared, we feel his fear and want to protect him; and when Joey is in pain, you can't help by cry for him. The best actor in the film is Joey and that is saying a lot as the acting by the main cast is quite good. Kudos to Spielberg for doing such a fantastic job of bringing Joey to life with such detail!The down-side of War Horse -if there has to be one- is Albert's journey. We don't meet up with him again until the last third of the film when we discover that he reached adulthood and is now a soldier in the British Army. Maybe it was a matter of time constraints, editing or maybe that's just how War Horse was written, but I feel that the we are denied a good piece of the story here as we don't get to experience Albert's plight as he reaches maturity, enlists in the army and sets out on his quest to find his beloved horse. I think seeing Joey and Albert's adventures unfold individually and then having them come together in the end would have had a greater impact on the overall feel of War Horse. I will admit that the film is predictable in a few spots and may be a little long in some areas, while other areas needed more attention (as noted above). Regardless, War Horse is entertaining and visually stunning. Well worth seeing and will certainly make a nice addition to anyone's DVD collection in the future! 8/10",War Horse
279,vctesse,"Oh, dear.",1,4 February 2012,"I knew that this couldn't be good when I'd heard that it was 2 hours and 40 minutes long because the book on which it was based was a nice little Young Adult novel clocking in at about 160 pages. Boy meets horse, boy loses horse, boy gets horse. But the whole story is told from the horse's viewpoint which was rather intriguing. Had the movie been done this way like say 'Babe' for instance where we view the action through the horse's eyes and hear his thoughts, it would have worked. The humans' conversation and actions could have been downplayed and we as the audience would easily be able to figure out what was going on. Instead we have this overpadded, overlong, overlit and very boring mess.Furthermore whole scenes were added that were not in the book and not necessary. And the young man was all wrong, bland and whiny. The part called for someone with real spunk. Jamie Bell comes to mind, but he's now too old. Do yourselves a favor and read the book.

I expected a gripping tail with excellent cinematography. I ended up sitting through over two hours of a boring show that did not seem to know where it wanted to go. One of the other reviewers summed it up nicely, stating that it seemed like Disney's attempt at a World War One movie. The only partially redeeming area of this movie was some of its cinematography. Unfortunately, the movie did not keep you engaged enough to truly appreciate the nicer looking scenes. In addition, many of the scenes seemed overly contrived. I found myself looking at my watch an hour and a half into the movie and being disappointed that I still had about an hour to go before the end. What frustrates me most about a movie such as this is that it will likely make out great when it comes to awards such as the Oscars solely based upon the name of the director; the movie did not excel in any area.I have to wonder how this movie is rating so high; if I was a pessimistic person, I would almost think that the movie studios must be hiring people go on sites such as this to boost the ratings of their shows.Save you money and your time.

284,CubeRic9000,Come for the horses,5,28 December 2011,"War Horse is the type of story where Steven Spielberg really shines. It has the potential for cinematic spectacle, the elementary emotional drama with convenient ebbs and flows, and the simplicity in narrative to reach audiences of all ages. The film's premise lies in a boy's love for his horse, and his longing to be reunited with it, after it has been taken away on war duty. The story however benefits from focusing not on the boy or any human character, but the horse itself, as we follow it throughout its life, as it personifies its own characteristic traits, and endeavours to survive at all costs. The horse, or more so horses, are the true stars of this film, and their beauty and strength is captured with genuine authenticity and grace. The cinematography achieves this through glorious shots that put you alongside, between, and above the horses, whilst at full gallop. They are breathtaking angles that take you in so close, that you feel the power of every stride, the tension on the muscles, and the thunderous sound of hooves smashing the ground. Aside from the cinematography deployed in the action sequences, the rest of film does not offer a lot. The performances achieve what's needed, and the story is straightforward and easy to understand. It does at times feel rushed as circumstances are almost pressed for time. For example new characters are regularly introduced throughout the horse's war time experiences, and each soldier or civilian garners an instant affinity with the horse. This feels somewhat questionable on the surface, but becomes a little comical, as each person who comes across the horse, falls for it, then has it taken away just as quickly, as if to keep the story moving on. It works on an imaginative level to represent somewhat of an aura with the horse, but the way characters are introduced and then dismissed from the film soon after, feels a bit like a production line.While I hoped for perhaps something more unique or less predictable, it doesn't really unfold with War Horse. It's a film that anyone could watch, as there is nothing really challenging here. It has all the essential ingredients that make a good family movie, from the likable characters, to the loyal and majestic horse. It has a grandiose score, sweeping landscape shots, and a colour thats easy on the eye, but by its close gets a little too fantastical. It shows triumph over adversity, picking its moments for some light situational humour, then wraps it all up with a feel good closure. The scenes of the film where the horses are at their most spectacular, really outshine anything else on offer here. They are the centre of this film, and as a consequence are put through what at times looked liked an extremely demanding role, that is somewhat questionable. But that aside, what is most evident is that the horses work harder than anyone in this, and at the very least deserve the pedestal Spielberg's film puts them on.",War Horse

My complaint is that I just didn't connect with the main character that well. You have to feel for the main character in order for a movie to work. That is not to say that his acting was poor, on the contrary, it was excellent. MAYBE A SPOILER!!!!!!! It is just that with all the sub stories about the horse, it just didn't give me enough of a chance to really care about any one of them. I love Spielberg, but I wouldn't sit through this movie a second time, ever.",War Horse

There's nothing too wrong with the movie as family flicks go, but it's just a bit too 'twee' and simplistic for adult minds. Some sections annoyed me - the French and German nationals talking to each other in accented English for example, and the speed at which some plot situations resolved themselves when hope seemed lost was just not believable. Trite, simplistic but good, honest and easy family fare. Not one of your best Mr. Spielberg.",War Horse
290,jokeco68,A horse as metaphor....,9,28 December 2011,"If there was ever an event in history marking where the old world met the new industrialized one it was the First World War and Spielberg spares little time emphasizing the clash as soon as Joey (the horse) reaches France. Suffice to say it is short and brutal although Spielberg,throughout, does not make the movie a gore fest such as 'Saving PrivateRyan'. What I was most struck by was that Joey was a fast, powerful wonder but he never did learn to jump. A recent review from Liam Lacey of the Globe and Mail claimed that Spielberg made the horse mythic in power, indestructible. Far from it, Liam Lacey, and you have completely missed the point. Joey never learned to jump clear of the obstacles, he was only mortal and he was terrified of technology, demonstrated with his meeting of the new war machine, the tank. It was through the truce of two cultures, the the abandonment of conflict and the co-operation towards a common goal that saves Joey from being ignored and lost. A great movie from Spielberg to be sure, it is nice to see that he now has the might and power to take the time to make a movie such as this one that does not go for the plain and simple and tries to convey a message that we need to recognize in this 21st century. Very commendable.",War Horse
291,sannelehmann,The worst film I have ever seen,1,27 June 2012,"This film is simply ridiculous from start to finish. I love movies and I love horses. To me the basic enjoyment of watching films is based in the simple concept of make believe. I need to as the viewer to believe in the characters, the setting, the story. I have to understand motives and be able to translate this into something, into a coherent vision. I have to be able to suspend my disbelief in order to allow the director to take me willingly into his world of make believe. This is exactly where War Horse fails miserably. I cannot believe that a poor family would even out of pride buy a thoroughbred instead of a plow horse, I cannot believe that a soldier would promise a young boy to take very good care of his horse and subsequently send him a drawing of that horse in the midst of war when people are dying all around him.I cannot be drawn into a movie that clearly is supposed to be a love story between a young man and his horse, underscored by the most sickening score ever to have been written by John Williams - if anyone can believe that at all.Every scene reeks of a kind of meta-awareness about itself - this is the scene where the bond between the horse and boy is established, this is the scene where the character of the father is revealed. Cancelling out any type of true emotion or pretense of make believe. For example the scene where the usually brilliant Emma Watson tells her son about the experiences of his father during the Boer war in South Africa. The scene is literally saying: This is the scene where the mother will reveal her love for her husband. I cannot remember a word of the dialog but only my sense of the self-awareness making the scene awkward and making me feel sorry for Emma Watson for having to read out such completely low-standard writing. When you are working with meta-awareness in order to create certain emotions you loose the make believe part. It is also extremely condescending - I feel I am being patronized by the film maker here. I throw this scene at you with a sickly girl living with her grandfather speaking out the most hideously written dialog ever and you are supposed to feel in a certain way.No! Mr. Spielberg - that is not the way it works!There is more make believe, truth and respect for the audience in the 3 min scene from Close Encounters where Dreyfuss builds that hill in his living room than there is in this entire film. 1 star - would have rated it even lower if possible.",War Horse
292,wildwing-1,"Not perfect, but wonderful",9,30 November 2011,"War Horse – 4 out of 5 starsTonight we went to an advance screening of Steven Spielberg's new movie War Horse. Having watched the trailer, I was excited to go see it and hopeful that it wasn't another horse-does- unrealistic things type of movie. For those who don't know, I grew up partially on a farm so I have a pretty good idea of what horses can and can't do, and how they think. Every time a horse came on screen, whether it was our equine star Joey or not, I immediately thought, ""No bad horse action! Please!"" My wish was answered 4 out of 5 times, but the few unrealistic incidents did make me take my rating down to 4 stars out of 5. Other than that, this movie is absolutely wonderful.Mr. Spielberg's eye for directing hasn't gotten any weaker over the years, that much is for sure. It's clear that he loves horses and shows them in a noble light that they well deserve. The cinematography by Janusz Kaminski is just stunning, not only the gorgeous opening long shots of England but also the horrors of the trench war in France. The ending scenes had my mouth hanging open in wonder, and it did make me mist up a bit. The casting was also fantastic; I watch a lot of movies and recognize a lot of B and character actors, and I didn't know a single person in this movie. I can't remember the last time that happened, but it really gave the film a ring of comfortable authenticity.Now on to the realistic horse problems. While they mostly dealt with the way horses really think, they did sometimes attribute human or dog mentality to them. Nothing as bad as, say, Mulan's or Rapunzel's horses in the Disney films, but a high-strung Thoroughbred learning to be harnessed and hooked to a plow and plowing an entire field in one day? Um or, when Joey steps in for his horse friend who is hurt oops. Or when he teaches the same friend that it's OK to wear a harness? Uh sorry guys, but even the smartest equine wouldn't do any of that. Even so, these scenes barely pulled me out of the movie; I kind of noticed them, groaned mentally, and went back to watching raptly. I was fascinated by some of the things that they got the horses to do and, in particular, one scene that could not have been done as shown. I can't wait to find out how they did it; you'll know it when you see it.The war scenes may be a bit intense for younger children, but there is no real on screen violence and very little blood, surprisingly enough. When people and animals are killed, it's either offscreen or blocked from view though you know what happened. I was very impressed by how they did it; when the British charge the German trenches it was as realistic as Saving Private Ryan but without all the blood, gore, and closeups of people killing each other. You hear lots of gunfire and see people fall, but there are no gaping wounds or fountains of blood. Also, my late grandfather fought in WWI so I found myself wondering if what I was seeing was anything like what he went through; I'm sure it's as close as I'll ever come to really knowing.A quick mention of the sound. I'm a big Civil War and slightly lesser WWII buff and have watched a lot of war movies, and this one had amazing sound effects for the bullets, cannons, and other noise of war. I was very impressed by the ""tearing linen"" sound of the shells overhead, and the booming metallic explosions of the German artillery. Very, very well done.The soundtrack was by John Williams; I need say no more, I'm sure.The story was a bit weak and predictable in places but since I didn't realize it until after the movie was over and I was thinking about it, I didn't give it any less of a rating for that. Nothing felt forced or coerced, and the entire film flowed smoothly and seamlessly. Some parts reminded me of other movies, specifically Black Beauty, Spirit: Stallion of the Cimmaron and Gone With the Wind in particular, but not to the point that it was obvious until after the film was over. If this movie looks of interest to you, I highly recommend it for both adults and children old enough to understand what the story is about.",War Horse
293,john-kim-howard,Consummately boring,4,15 April 2012,"Being a history buff I thought this movie may interest me. The history lesson doesn't happen. Instead we drag along endlessly in a, guess what, children's story. Complete with the horse being made emotionally anthropomorphic complete with heroic actions for his horse friend. I gave it a 4 rather then a 1 or 2 simply because it has the well done Spielberg landscape shots. The story line had me positively bored to tears. Perhaps because I'm not a horse lover I couldn't connect. Basically the entire movie is the horse, Joey, moving from English people, to German people, to French people, back to German people, and eventually back to English people. Everyone quickly recognizes what a truly special horse Joey is. In a nutshell, every action scene in the movie you will have seen in an advertisement.",War Horse
294,eldestjay,The Best of the Worst,7,11 December 2011,"Nothing is worse than a movie that is unsure of itself. War Horse is one of those movies. It can't decide whether it wants to be a family film, a romance/drama, or a graphic war film. I'm sorry, but without the proper amount of violence and gore, a war centered movie is usually not worth the watch! This holds true for the newest Spielberg flick. I walked into a pre-screening of this movie, expecting bad, but coming out both pleasantly surprised, and thoroughly annoyed. The pleasantness came from that fact that it made a very good family film. It was sweet, warming, and had a certain charm to it. However, the battle scenes appalled me. The graphics were flat, the cinematography was boring to say the least, and the actual fighting itself was atrocious. Not atrocious as in bloody decapitations, and mangled limbs; atrocious as in, none of that at all. Honestly, War Horse seemed like two separate films: A very warmhearted film for the fam, and a very awful war movie. Yes, as one may be able to tell, the main disappointments of this movie lie within the trenches of family-friendly combat. One might say ""This movie sucks."" and be completely justified. But if you prefer absolutely no realistic blood or violence within the orifices of an action warfare movie, then you might actually enjoy this film more than I did.Overall, the acting was stellar, the writing was good, and the inclusive story was mildly interesting. Nonetheless, War Horse was generally disappointing.",War Horse

I am firmly on the latter side and thoroughly enjoyed this movie which is based on a very good children's book by Michael Morpugo. Yes it is sentimental in parts,but what's wrong about that? On the other side it also brings home the horrors of trench warfare and the overall futility of WW1 which is nicely contrasted with Devon country life in the early 1900s. It is a superbly made film - would you expect anything else from Spielberg? and I agree with all the positive comments made in other reviews. A film that is sure become a classic.",War Horse
296,jackmronner,Beating a Dead War Horse,1,26 December 2011,"Despite being a Spielberg AND a horse fan, almost walked out of the theater on this one. ""Trojan Horse"" would have been a more apt title (tho' there were no surprises to be had in this one), since every aspect of the movie was wooden, especially the acting. It really seemed the work of an old ""B"" movie director; every emotion was a haymaker, telegraphed at that, that missed its mark every time (Please cry here). It seemed a pastiche of scenes we've seen in other movies. None of the actions of the characters seemed natural or even sensible (even a city boy knows you can't plow a field til you've removed the rocks! By all means shoot the horse your lives depend on when it shies from the collar the first time. Etc., etc). If it had succeeded in evoking any emotion in me I might call it mawkish or maudlin, but it never rose to that level. And a terrible screenplay to go along with the treacly, intrusive scoring. Tried, but failed to re-create similar films from the Golden Years, as he did so wonderfully with Indiana (heck, I was more touched by the monkey in ""Lost Ark"" than the horse here)",War Horse

298,filmcriticonfire,John Ford film in the era of Spielberg.,6,12 January 2012,"This is an emotional, feel good family flick, made to pull at heartstrings. The story, about a bond between a horse and a boy, starts out taking place in the British countryside, just prior to World War I. The bond between the horse and a boy named Albert Narrcott (Jeremy Irvine) starts out right at the very beginning of the film when he witnesses the horse being born on a neighboring farm. A few years later, The horse comes to auction. Albert's father, Ted (Peter Mullan) purchases the horse at the auction for far more than what he can afford. Ted, a well meaning drunkard sees something in the horse that no one else sees. Ted's intention of using the horse to plow his farm makes him the town laughing stock. Ted brings the horse home much to the dismay of his wife, Rose (Emma Watson.) Rose is worried that the horse will never learn how to work a plow, and demands that the horse be returned. Albert steps in and is steadfast that he can train the horse to plow the field; mother yields to her son. The landlord of the farm shows up and threatens to take the land away if Ted cannot produce a crop. Albert then proceeds to raise the horse (naming him Joey), teaching him to come when whistled for (important part of the story) and eventually teaches him how to take to the plow. Together Albert and Joey prove everybody wrong when they plow the field, saving it from being repossessed by the landlord.World War I breaks out, and the horse is sold by Ted to the British Army (as a lot of horses were in those days.) Albert is heartbroken when he loses his beloved horse, vowing that they will be reunited one day. The narrative of the story is then told through Joey's eyes, so to speak. Joey embarks on many adventures in the war, going to work for both the British and German Armies, and even happens upon a French girl and her grandfather in the process. Meanwhile, Albert is now of age and has joined the British Army. Joey becomes injured in the war and is rescued by a British and German Soldier who call a temporary truce to save him. The British Soldier takes Joey back to base to have his wounds cared for. One doesn't have to be a fortune teller to see what is going to happen next....in regards to weather or not Albert and Joey will be reunited.This film is about 60 years too late for its time. Back in the 1940s, cinema was highly censored. Films depicting war were censored so as to not ""frighten the masses"" to true nature of the horrors of war. Steven Spielberg has seemed to take a page right out of a John Ford movie when he directed this movie. The scenes on the farm in the British countryside almost appear as though they were filmed on a set, like films were made in the Golden Era. The score emphasizes on happy, feel good sounds of birds singing in the air, tied in with music meant to tug on one's emotions. When the The sequences of the Battle of Somme come, it is late in the film and they barely touch on the brutality of that actual event.When Spielberg directed ""Saving Private Ryan"" (1998) he was not bound by the censorship laws of yesteryear's. That film depicted how brutally ugly war can be and the battle sequences held no punches on the the blood and guts. ""War Horse"" seems to hide that WWI was a brutally ugly war, choosing instead to make the audience feel happy when in fact war should have the opposite effect. Horses WERE in fact used in WWI, but I doubt if there was ""feel good"" story behind any of them.While everyone likes to be inspired, which this film does by tugging at heartstrings, today's society is not living with blinders on like Joey the War Horse. Today's audience is not naive to the real horrors of war as Hollywood of the 1940s thought they were back then. Spielberg chose to take the safe route of making the audience feel good, instead of showing them what the real WWI was like.Im shocked that his picture is getting so much Oscar buzz. The acting is good, and the well cast. I will give Spielberg and his crew credit for cinematography, art direction, and musical score. But best picture? Maybe if you put this film a time machine and ship it back to 1945...",War Horse

Make no mistake: Spielberg is in top form...and watching this film is a true lesson from a Master filmmaker that novices like Michel Hazanavicius should watch repeated times.

One thing history has clearly shown is that Empire before 1904 was bustling, after 1919 it had all but failed. Germany did win, but the allied forces huckstered the Germans into failure. The biggest issue was unable to get the troops to do their duty in light of huge casualties. Very understandable war is for creeps. There was nothing okay from WW1 it led to WW2.This story tries to make a hero out of a horse. Wonderful, just what we need some farm animal to tell us war is okay.

We saw the movie when it opened on Christmas Day. We viewed it in a theater where practically every seat was occupied to watch the heroics of Joey, the amazing horse that became a survivor of The War to End All Wars in Europe. This movie provides a renewed opportunity to remember just how tragic the inhumane orders issued by a few powerful men created horror for animals and men. What's particularly meaningful in ""War Horse"" is how World War I forever impacted on the lives and the horses for both the Allies and the Germans. Horses are the stars of ""War Horse"" as they realistically take on human emotions. Thankfully, no horses were harmed during the filming and Joey, the hero, survives the War. This movie will be greatly enjoyed by history enthusiasts because of the realistic portrayal of World War I trench warfare and the strategic use of Infantry horses. Only one scene seemed an outlier, when an Allied and a German enter No Man's Land to rescue Joey. Although rare situations of cooperation probably occurred in World War I, the transactions probably didn't transpire in perfect English.

304,jpc8024,A flawed Spielberg masterpiece,7,2 January 2012,"WAR HORSE It was a book straight out of Scholastic Book Magazine, then it was a wonderful play, now it's a epic war picture directed by Steven Spielberg. I get the portrait and setting of the film whick takes place in Southern Rural England on a farm with a boy and his horse Joey, which is a dark brown stallion and then shifts to the frontlines of World War I and the battles. I enjoyed the beautiful sunset ending which brought some closure to the piece. The orchestrated music by John Williams was great. The actors who were in this were interesting. But they were just some parts of this movie that made me yawn a bit. The scene in which the battles began just got boring. The scene that was funny was the little girl teaching her horse how to gallop and go over a piece of barb wire. I also liked the scene where the townspeople were using pounds of money to sell horses from the stables because they were poor and hopeless. I did not like the father in this film. It's wrong to kill a animal. But the son judges his father not to kill Joey. The miracle of the story is the War Horse; Joey. The best part is when he gallops, struts and flies through a battle that's being taken place full of land mines and explosive grenades. 2 hours and 26 minutes later, the film holded my attention but not firmly. This must've been really hard material for a director like Steven Spielberg because the material is filled with complex emotion which can be a challenge for Spielberg rather than simple slick special effects gimmicks like Indiana Jones, E.T. or Jaws. ""War Horse"" is also a film that's less than brilliant then Patton or Pearl Harbor, if your a fan of the militia genre. The emotional ties and the feelings the characters go through are sentimentally human and just pure good quality film actors and actresses. The screenplay is a yarn. The editing is old-fashioned and the costumes are filled with coats, boots, dresses, hats. I didn't care for the costumes at all in this film. The art direction was too old and not techno enough. It's a period piece either that's going to excite you or bore you. I admit after the movie I was less enthusiastic about the picture and started talking to my movie buddie more about the other Spielberg movie: Adventures of Tin-Tin: Secret of the Unicorn which was wonderfully exciting and well worth the wait than talking about War Horse. ""War Horse"" is a yarny drama, for right now. I want to push myself to see it again because I know it will be up for awards this season and not out of the race for Globes yet.

I really liked this movie - I had no idea what the movie would show me, beside World War I and a horse, so when the the movie began I was pleasantly surprised. I though the movie showed a lot of honesty and both human and inhuman actions.People say that they couldn't identify with any of the characters. I really don't know how anyone could say that. Yes, the story is about how a guy becomes very close with the horse his father buys. And I can't see how anyone who has ever had a pet or just any relationship with a person cannot relate to this feeling or bond that they share. People care for things, even horses..Anyway - to the point - it is a very tragic story, as most war stories are, but it is a different kind of story. You follow a journey from start to ending and it has sorrow and happiness and loss. And no you don't have to like horses, I don't, and I enjoyed it.It moved me. I don't know how, but it might have been Jeremy Irvines amazing acting that made me weep a bit, but is was very, very good and honest.I will recommend it, but with that in mind, it is not an action movie, so if that's what you're looking for, then I suggest you watch ""The Avengers"" instead.",War Horse

309,collie-12,I Loved This Film--It's an Old School Three-Handkerchief Picture (But I Guess It's Not for Everyone),9,28 December 2011,"I saw this film on Christmas night, and I loved it; the friend I was with, not so much. Perhaps I loved it so because I love animals and animal stories, and this film is sort of an equine version of ""Lassie Come Home"" in some ways. I am also an Anglophile, and I have an interest in things dealing with the First World War as well. My friend again, not so much. In addition, I like long films. If I'm going to pay $9.50 to see a film, I want to get my money's worth; therefore, I didn't mind the fact that it ran nearly two and one half hours. I am not sure what my friend felt about the length because he didn't say and I didn't ask.I'll be the first to admit this film is very sentimental—but once again, that's alright by me. It was certainly lacking a great deal in the witty dialog department. My friend and I both like clever dialog, so that might have contributed to my friend's less than enthusiastic response. But witty dialog would have been out of place in this film, so lack of it is not a fault really. The film also offered very little comic relief, but that too would have been out of place in this film and so, in retrospect, is not a fault. Still, I can understand these criticisms.There are a couple points where I definitely take issue with my friend's criticism, however. He found the acting to be bad. I quite the contrary! I found all the actors incredibly believable and moving! He also said the film was predictable. While that might be true of the over-all tone perhaps, I thought the film provided quite a few little surprises that I never would have predicted. I will not reveal any of them here because I don't want to give spoilers that might keep potential viewers from reading this review. That said, I consider myself pretty good at recognizing formulaic plot devices so if I was surprised in places, I feel it safe to say most viewers will be too.The story literally kept me on the edge of my seat for a great deal of the picture—especially the last third of it. I found the cinematography to be quite beautiful with its green fields of Devon and its dark silhouettes set against magnificent orange skies. The costumes were also very well done, very historically correct. I likewise enjoyed John Williams' score. And although there is quite a lot of violence and death in this film—after all it is set in the First World War so what would you expect?—the violence is very discrete and tastefully done. You don't see anyone's guts spilling out before your eyes—no blood and gore. Personally that's a plus for me. It also makes the film quite suitable for viewers as young as nine or ten. Those younger than that will most likely fail to understand much of the film, but I'd hazard a guess that girls between the ages of ten and twenty, especially those who like horses, will like this film. I really could find no fault with it whatsoever. I do hate to sound sexist here, but I think this film might appeal more to women in general however. That's not to say men won't enjoy this film, but as a woman myself, I'm simply guessing that it will appeal more to women. Of course, that could probably be said of horses in general. I should also add that I'm a big fan of old movies from the 30s and 40s, so I like the fact that this film copies their style in so many ways. I see other reviewers here have compared it to ""Gone with the Wind"", ""All Quiet On the Western Front"" and the works of John Ford; and that's fine with me. It's great to be able to enjoy a new movie for the same reasons I enjoy the classics. Will I ten years from now include this picture among my all-time favorites? Probably not. Would I want to watch it again? Definitely yes! Is it a great film? Many viewers will probably say yes. Is it a good film? I don't see how anyone could say no. Would I recommend it to others? If you like animals stories and or sentimental dramas, emphatically yes! If not—well I'd still recommend you give it a try only be warned you might not 'love' this picture. Still you might like it.",War Horse

311,Al_Scarface_Capone,A Fantastic War Movie that Will Appeal to All Audiences,7,5 November 2011,"I was lucky enough to see War Horse in a special pre-screening last week, and I can safely say I will be seeing it again when its released on Christmas day. I went in with relatively low expectations, after watching the series of mediocre trailers, and walked out being able to safely say that War Horse is one of the best movies of the year, one of Steven Spielberg's best films, and, quite possibly, one of the best war films ever made, up there with my personal favorites The Thin Red Line, Apocalypse Now and Paths of Glory. Steven Spielberg had long said that he didn't want to make Saving Private Ryan again. He said he wanted War Horse to be a war movie that parents cant take their children to and teach them something about love and war, and in this respect I can say that he more than succeeded. Spielberg comes close to the clinical perfection of Private Ryan, but more importantly, from an emotional perspective, War Horse far exceeds Private Ryan. There are many people apt to cry at Private Ryan, but War Horse is more likely to cause tears at a similar level to, say, Schindler's List. More importantly, unlike either Schindler or Private Ryan, War Horse is unlikely to cause any sort of political or moral complaints. He never tempers the anti-war message with nationalist tripe. Rather, he plays war straight. War is evil, men are good. There are no sides in this movie. In fact, at various points throughout the film, he seems to directly reject Saving Private 's heroism is dying for country message.War Horse is based on the children's book and play of the same name. It is about a boy who's father, on a whim, buys a horse for his son that he knows will never be what is needed for the farm work it is purchased for. The boy forms an incredible bond with the horse. The first forty five minutes of the film is spent establishing the relationship between boy and horse. This part of the film is rather slow, but is necessary to establishing the film's central relationships, and is quickly made up for by the shift in pace as soon as the war begins. From the Scottish country side, after this important turning point in world history, War Horse shifts to France, where the titular horse is serving after being sold to the army. The boy is a year or two too young to follow his horse to Europe at this point, so for the next section, the film follows the horse only. From here on out, I will leave the plot a mystery, but it is gripping, thrilling, and very emotional.There are two scenes in War Horse that I think are worthy of further mention. The first is a charge across no man's land. For anyone not familiar with the bulk of World War I's combat, it consisted of months at a time of back and forth shooting between trenches, broken up by awful charges across no man's land, to take a few hundred yards of enemy territory. These charges, as short as they were, as a result of the machine gun, came with death tolls in the thousands or higher. War Horse contains one of these charges, and it is carried out with both taste, and near perfect artistry. It is just grisly enough to get the reality across, but not so grisly that it makes the movie impossible to show to younger audiences. In fact, this trench charge ranks up with Steven Spielberg's other famous World War battle scene, the beach landing in Saving Private Ryan. It doesn't quite make it, but it comes close.The other scene worthy of mention also occurs in the trenches, and reflects the other side of War Horse. The titular horse gets caught in the barbed wire in No Man's Land. The soldiers on either side spot it. No one knows what to do, as it is clear that its in incredible pain, but they know that leaving their respective trench would expose them to machine gun fire. Eventually two soldiers, one British, the other German both move to free the horse. The soldiers on both sides know what is going on, so no one fires a shot. This scene is unbelievably touching. The discussion they have (the German soldier happens to speak good English, explained adequately through a joke) will move even the most cynical of viewers, and gives a good idea of just what perspective War Horse takes to the act of war.There are a few small problems in War Horse that, in most films, I would take issue with, but I will forgive in this case as I feel that they are so necessary for this film to appeal to younger audiences. The German soldiers speak English to one another, a big pet peeve for me. I would have preferred for French characters to speak subtitled French and German characters to speak subtitled Germans, but I recognize that many younger viewers refuse to read subtitles. There are a few unnecessary jokes, but again, younger viewers will enjoy these. Spielberg, as always, has three different endings tacked onto the movie, in this case necessary to provide the cut and dry resolution younger viewers require. As I said, these are still problems, but they are, for better or worse, required to accomplish what Spielberg was trying to.I can say with absolute certainty that when Christmas rolls around, I will be dragging all my younger relatives to a screening of War Horse. I have never seen a movie so able to pull its punches enough to get a PG- 13 rating, but show enough to explain just what it is about war that makes it such an odious, disgusting, awful affair. In short, see War Horse as soon as you possibly can.",War Horse
312,aleph999,What happened to the great American directors?,1,5 March 2013,"A few days ago I watched Prometheus by Ridley Scott and barely managed to get to the end of that unbearably fake movie with its idiotic script. Now I had to endure this mushy B-rate melodramatic complacent trash by Spielberg. Not a drop of intelligence, originality, passion, what you will. Just a tiresome, miscast, aimless compilation of clichés. It is quite embarrassing, really. I felt ashamed for Mr Spielberg.Apparently all intelligent life has fled Hollywood, which was taken by storm by a bunch of CGI guys, and took refuge in TV series, some of which are actually written by adults for adults.On the other hand, there are some pretty nice sunsets.",War Horse
313,Spritedude23,Immensely Satisfying,8,24 January 2012,"This is not a movie to watch casually. That said, it is definitely a movie to watch, and emotionally invest in it, the payoff is incredible. Although the beginning lagged a bit (there could have easily been a good 15 minutes taken off of the running time), once the battle scenes picked up I became enthralled.Steven Spielberg hits home once again with this film, and John William's soundtrack is completely outstanding. And there is a slew of recognizable actors from David Thewlis (Remus Lupin in Harry Potter) to Eddie Marsan (Inspector Lestrade in Sherlock Holmes).Overall this movie was immensely satisfying, and moving in a couple parts.Eight solid stars.",War Horse
314,markc14,War Horse is sure to become an instant classic,9,9 December 2011,"Sure to become an instant classic, War Horse is a surprising return to 1930's style films where character development is key. Stylistically, it reminds me of Howard Hawks' Oscar-winning WWI masterpiece, Sergeant York. Although based on a novel, this film spotlights the actual use of cavalry during the Great War. After 1914, both sides largely abandoned this style of warfare in favor of tanks. The British continued to use mounted troops throughout the conflict. It appears to capture some real events in the Alsatian region of France and the Bloody Somme.While it has some amazingly accurate depictions of WWI combat, this movie is really about family, loyalty, the folly of war, and the special relationships we forge with some of God's creatures. Spielberg largely eschews fast-paced action to show us the heart of his human and animal characters. A beautiful score by John Williams and breathtaking cinematography by Janusz Kaminski cap off the very high production values of this movie. The audience at my screening was rapt in its attention throughout its entire 2.5 hour duration and quite a bit of sniffling could be heard during the moving finale. Highly recommended for the entire family.",War Horse
315,sixstringshowcase,A really moving and worthwhile War film with an awesome twist!,10,3 September 2018,"This was a great film, from start to finish. It tries to illustrate the toll of humans and their penchant for war. Using the horse makes it even more compelling. Also, showing that the horse doesn't take ""sides"" is profound! Every element of this film is enjoyable. It's sad, it's definitely sentimental, and it's also heart-warming. It's Seabiscuit with a war theme. And, also, great attention to detail of the Great War.",War Horse

I thought this would be an incredible combination; the trailer gave me chills and I thought I would need to bring a box of Kleenex to the movie theater. But then, I went to actually see the movie and the only tears that I (should have) shed were for the loss of the eight dollars that I paid to see this ridiculous drama. The only good acting in this movie comes from the horse. The script is silly, the dialogue is just awful, and the movie is devoid of a single great moment, which is hard to say about a film involving two passionate topics - the bond of man and horse and the horror of war.",War Horse
317,schapman74,An unexpected treat!,7,18 March 2012,"I'll be honest, I'm far from the biggest fan of Steven Spielberg here on the IMDb. I figured him more of a has-been than anything else, certainly as a director. The 2008 Indiana Jones is largely considered to be a right stinker, and War of the Worlds is another one that appeared to have disappointed just about everyone.But wow! Way to redeem yourself Mr. Spielberg. War Horse came as such a treat for me, and going into the credits, I had no idea who its director was. I'll admit that I was pleasantly surprised!War Horse, if given a chance, is a wonderful movie. It will move you, it will make you laugh, and it will put a lump in your throat. There are some absolutely delightful scenes, and there are also plenty of sequences where it will stress a subwoofer, for the bass heads out there.Recommended!",War Horse
318,mormonhippie,Not Another Horse Movie...,8,11 April 2012,"Even though it looks like it. Sure it has the whole ""Bond between man and animal"" thing going on, but it's a whole lot bigger then that. It's a wonderful story about courage in the face of seemingly insurmountable obstacles. About being brave when your first instinct is fear. About belonging and ownership. Joey is the horse, a diamond in the rough. He is inherently valuable, beautiful and precious. Almost everyone (on both sides of the war) who looks at him can see it.Throughout the story, this horse is continually placed in circumstances that he isn't ""fit"" for. He isn't a draft animal, he's afraid of loud noise, he's decidedly NOT a jumper. Yet he has to perform the part of a draft horse, he has to run toward shooting guns, and if he doesn't jump...I'll save THAT part for you to see. And by being the magnificent animal he is and in doing all of these things, things he is NOT ""supposed"" to do, he inspires the humans around him.In short, this was a superb, gripping and inspiring movie.Downside: From the very beginning, you can see where the story is going. A bi-product of being the type of movie that this is, the horse has multiple owners throughout the movie but You...the viewer...""Know"" its not going to turn out good for anyone of them.Because Joey...and Albert...belong...together!!! The WORLD MUST BE SET RIGHT!!!In addition to an ensemble of very talented and well cast actors, this movie contains Thomas William Hiddleston, an incredibly handsome and talented actor. I really wouldn't count this against the film except He's only in it for about 15 minutes and I reeaaallly wanted to look at him a bit longer.",War Horse
319,gfranceschini,"Exaggerated, cheesy but visually great",5,3 February 2012,"I really liked this film visually. The locations, shots' angles, colors and set design were great and made this movie one of the best film of the year.However, even if the storyline was beautiful and exciting, the flow of the narrative becomes boring and excessively dramatic. Everything is exaggerated and pushed over the top. As watching the film I felt like every single scene or crucial event was way too much dramatized, which led me to feel tired of what I was watching. Moreover, the relationship between the horse (Joey..what kind of name is that?) and Albert, a unique friendship which is absolutely beautiful and moving, becomes pathetic and cheesy. Albert's mad love for his horse is just not credible and absurd.As a Spielberg's film I was surprised by the acting: some characters (ex. the German soldier's younger brother) were such bad actors and the French little girl had such a fake french accent: I was more interested in her speaking than in her role in the film!!!This movie was great, but had those few problems... oh well Steven go back to your aliens and dinosaurs!",War Horse

No surprise, as it's a typical instant classic (pardon the oxymoron) Spielberg movie, complete with the epic John Williams soundtrack (should have won the Oscar, in my humble opinion). The storyline was great, and, despite being a war movie, avoided the stereotypical patriotic fervor, instead portraying the horse itself on both side, surviving the horrors of war. It had it's tear jerker moments, such as finding out Emily was dead, and it's grin moments, such as Joey's following Emily over the small fence rather than the larger, and was an all around great movie! It even avoided the common view in movies today that ""horses are for girls"" by making the secondary characters both male and female. The truth is, though, that the horse is the true star of this film, despite what the brief description on the movie's page implies. Once again, War Horse was an incredible movie, my favorite of 2011, despite Captain America, Thor, and other good movies.",War Horse

And I do not remember when I have been more disappointed. By mid-movie, I just wanted to leave but stayed until the bitter end, hoping for some redeeming story-telling.If you have already seen/read Black Beauty or Lassie Come Home, you know this story. Yes, Spielberg delivers some fantastic production values but the story is pure schlock. Did he forget to hire a quality screenwriter? Surely he can afford the best.Although I am willing to believe that no animals suffered physical injury, I do not think you can explain to a horse ""actor"" (who is not really a willing participant) that it is not in actual danger.The development of the human characters is almost non-existent. I read that Spielberg was so enthralled with this project that it was purchased, produced and distributed all in 12 months.

324,l-s-rosenblum,two hour wait for one very good scene,4,26 January 2012,"This is a typical overly sentimental movie that announces that a big scene is about to occur. Spielberg at his most melodramatic. From the salt of the earth family who are down on their luck to the pure of heart boy who raises and trains the horse, every cliché is on parade. So you get the story of how this horse came to join in WWI and the dramas that follow. Don't worry that there is no space left to lecture us on how WWI changes the nature of war and gentlemen are no longer suited for it. Watch the horse alternate between scenes of cruelty and kindness until a very fine scene 2 hours into this way too long movie where British and Germans need to come together to save the horse.Fine production values and many well constructed sets, but the movie is little more than Benji with a horse.",War Horse

Its good to know that not only men suffered in war, there were animals too that were used and killed. Unfortunately this movie was just too much and too cheesy. The horse was so good and helped his friends, carrying the gun and so on. It was so obvious what will happen during the movie and till the end. You know who will die and who will live and that it goes to a typical crappy Hollywood happy end. Horse movies like ""black beauty"" and ""the horse whisperer"" are much better and much more emotional. ""War horse"" didn't touch me at all. I just didn't care at all what was going on. The story about the horse might be good for 10 year old girls, but then the war scenes are to cruel. So there is a problem to find the right audience for this movie. I don't understand at all why it is nominated for 7 Oscars. Probably they didn't see it, they just thought that steven made it, so it should be good. And it is not.",War Horse

327,Quillmaster,I had more empathy for the Grand National,6,10 February 2012,"Oh dear... I must say having come back from watching this that I was hugely disappointed. I was expecting a lot more from Stephen Spielberg, and am having trouble comprehending that he was at all involved, other than a few moments of nice cinematography.I was expecting an emotional film where I'd connect with the horse as an entity in its own right, but this just didn't happen except for a brief moment when it runs through no mans land near the end of the film, which is painfully distant from the start.Near the beginning of the film, we're asked to accept that a farmer is willing to pay over the odds for a horse not fit for the task he's buying it for. This should then lead to the segment of the film where the central character becomes inseparable from the horse, but I failed to see any such bonding taking place. Indeed, for me at least, the whole film felt like a missed opportunity to make the horse a character that we could empathise with. Instead, the horse is strangely absent from a good portion of the film, and when we do see it, all we are really seeing is it being shuffled among new owners that it feels a waste of time getting to know.The film does redeem itself a little when it arrives at the Somme, with some spectacular depictions of the horror of trench warfare, and a heart warming moment when a soldier from both sides comes to the aid of the horse, but by this time all I really wanted was for the film to end.To think I was worried about seeing this film alone in case I became the spectacle of a grown man leaving the cinema in tears (I'm an emotional animal lover) is laughable. I felt more empathy for the Grand National. If you want to see a real tear jerker with exceptional animal acting, see the original ""Lassie Come Home"" with Roddy McDowell and Elizabeth Taylor. If you go to see ""Warhorse"" expecting an emotional epic, I think you'll be disappointed.",War Horse
328,Serenstars,Exceeded my expectations,9,29 May 2012,"I was extremely wary of watching this film due to the fact that I had read the book to my children when they were younger, and had also been to see the stage production at the National Theatre - both of which were superb. Reading a few negative reviews from the critics, I decided not to go and see War Horse when it went on general release, because I feared that it would be transformed into the usual Hollywood sap and the essence of the original story would somehow be lost. So it is only now on my monthly film subscription channel that I decided to watch it and I am so glad I did. It was much, much better than I was expecting. I honestly think some of the reviewers are missing the point entirely. Yes the story is rather corny and 'unbelievable' - but it is based on a children's book. It's not meant to be a historical account of the first World War, or some intense documentary account for adults. Michael Morpurgo writes books for children as a means of both entertaining and educating at the same time and in my opinion Spielberg has stayed absolutely true to that. So it's 'far fetched'. So what? Aren't a lot of children's stories, and that's what this is. To tell a story of war from the perspective of a horse obviously requires a suspension of belief - whether you are reading the book, watching the stage production or going to see the film, but once you get past that then you begin to see the many excellent things about this film - the wonderful cast, incredible cinematography, a sublime musical score and so on - movie making of the highest calibre.

330,irishguy122,Thought Provoking,7,20 May 2012,"Having seen 'War Horse' in the theater in London two years ago, I had high expectations for this film. And while it didn't blow me away, it certainly did make me think.While it superficially follows the journey of Albert and his horse Joey from their farm in Devon to war in France and back again, it is the host of characters, from both sides of the trenches, and their perspectives on the most tragic war in modern times that we meet along the way that really keep the movie ticking. While building the relationship between Joey and Albert at the beginning of the film, it does tend to drag on a bit. But once we reach the war, the battle scenes instantly snap you back in to focus, with the focus on the futility and stupidity of this tragic conflict. The British cavalry charge on the German camp stood out to me as an utterly brilliant scene, and it served to set the energetic pace for the rest of the film.An excellent cast performance, sweeping dramatic landscapes and a heart warming tale serve to earn this movie a rating of 7/10.",War Horse
331,anudeepraju,War Horse.......... is beyond film........it's an incredible adventure!!!!,10,12 February 2012,"Steven Spielberg has always enthralled audiences alike with fascinating tales through his films.War horse is yet another such masterpiece. It is the story of a horse(the real hero,Joey) and his master,Albert.Standing at the doorsteps of first world war,they are forced to a separation, but before giving away Joey ,Albert ties a pennant that was given to his father for his bravery.Joey is sold to the British armed forces and is deployed to France where it comes close to a black horse,Topthorn.In France,along with Topthorn,Joey undergoes military training under the command of Captain Nicholls.But in an attack of the British forces against the Germans Captain Nicholls is killed and Joey gets into the hands of Gunther a German soldier,who uses Joey to escape along with his brother,Michael to Italy.But later ,one night they are caught hiding in a windmill in a French countryside by the Germans and are executed.The horses next get into the hands of Emilie a girl who lives with her grandfather on the farm.Emilie suffers from brittle bones, and is not allowed to ride the horses for fear of falling. But when the German soldiers discover the horses they take it away.Here Joey and Topthorn undergo a lot of hardships and Topthorn succumbs out of exhaustion.In a deliberate attempt to escape,Joey gallops and enters into a no man's land and get's entangled in barbed wire.Saved by a British soldier Joey is brought back to the British Trenches, where he comes back to Albert.But soon it is decided only officers' horses will be shipped home, while Joey and the others are to be auctioned off to the highest bidder. The soldiers gather funds to help Albert buy Joey, but in the bid Emilie's grandfather bids and gets Joey for 100 pounds.Emilie has died, and after hearing about the miracle horse, her grandfather walked three days to get Joey back for the sake of Emilie's memory.Albert pleads with Emilie's grandfather for the horse, but the old man remains stoic in his auction win. As the grandfather walks away, Joey breaks free and goes to Albert. As he watches the horse and the young English soldier, the grandfather pulls the military pennant from his pocket and asks Albert if it means anything to him. When Albert tells the old man that it belongs to his father, the grandfather has a change of heart. First he gives Albert the campaign pennant, then moments later gives him Joey, saying it is what Emilie would have wanted. In the end Albert rides Joey back to his family's farm, hugs his parents, and returns the pennant to his father. Spielberg enthralls the viewers with a very simple story told in the most epic fashion possible.He blends those emotional lovely moments with the horrifying war scenes in the trench with utmost brilliance.He surely deserves kudos for his this work of masterpiece.With incredible cinematography and art direction that has every reason to justify the backdrop of World standing at the edge of war to the deep trenches on the war front.Even the score by John Willams is an important facet in transforming this film into an experience. Performances are also to be lauded,especially for newcomers Jeremy Irvine and Celine Buckens, and also for Emily Watson,Tom Hiddleston,Niels Arestrup and Peter Mullan.Oh yes Joey............If they were giving out equestrian Oscars, then this horse would surely be a strong contender for George Clooney or Jean DuJardin for that matter.Jokes apart .........the horse honestly is the show stealer.This surely is one of the best films of the year.",War Horse
332,theindustry,Very well made. A modern film reminiscent of the classics.,8,10 January 2012,"It is well understood from the first few scenes that the typical cliché of both war films and animal dramas will stain Spielberg's canvas, yet the film pushes forward, earning well-deserved praise. Quite a few scenes are captivating to say the least; as is the scene with the horse, Joey, forging through heavily barb-wired no man's land.'War Horse' surely reminisces the older WW1 films, and epic war films in general, such as Lawrence of Arabia, that drag on forever, yet do not fail to keep you enthralled with their stunning visuals and top-notch acting. Jeremy Irvine's performance was acceptable for an actor fairly new to the game, as were the performances of the gamut of child actors in the film, but honorable mentions must go to Emily Watson, Niels Arestrup, and Peter Mullan. The production did a wonderful job to give the horse Joey a deeper personified image, as if he were an actor. The same goes for the other horses in the film, who seem to converse amongst each other and reveal a chemistry shared between animal and animal, as well as animal and man. A wonderful job on the whole. Certainly Spielberg's finest work in recent months (yes, I don't think cowboys and aliens should ever mix).For what its worth, this picture will move you deeply, as it has done to many. 'War Horse' inspires anti-war sentiments, as Joey's endeavors help him sympathize with men on both sides of the trenches, and ultimately reminds us of the beauty of Earths beasts. Each one has its own character that strikes a chord with the audience, and this is undeniable.Enjoy!",War Horse
333,c-a-r-l-o-s,I really wanted to like this more...,6,26 December 2011,"...but it was a little too long in the 1st part. It was called War Horse, but it should have been called Farm Horse w/Some Sporadic War towards the end. The 1st hour sort of dragged longer than it needed, it did do a good job of introducing the horse (Joey?, really?), but you don't really find out why the dad bought him at all. I read another review and agree with it about the tone switching from light hearted to more serious tone too quickly instead of transitioning. The guy who played Loki in the Thor movie did the best while he had the horse. He was pretty likable, the rally speech you see in the preview before it gets good is done very well. I liked all 3 Indiana Jones and especially Saving Private Ryan, but I think Steven Spielberg kind of missed something in this one. I just don't know what. I'm a big fan of war movies and I like horses; I liked the horse in it but I just don't know what was missing from this one. It was overall better than awful, one of those movies you see once, like, and don't buy the DVD. Not a waste of time, though, it ended well.",War Horse

After reading the book i decided to watch the film. I think it followed the story-line as close as it possible can get. The animals looked realistic the sounds were realistic. I think one of the reasons it was like the book was because Michael Morpurgo helped. I think everybody who likes the book war horse should enjoy the film. I have watched all the things related to war horse : Theater Production , The musical, film and book. and I think the film is my second favorite out of these my favorite was the book. The thing about the movie was how it looked so real and the actors were so good.",War Horse

It told a story that was spread on so many different perspectives. I loved that we didn't have one hero that saved the day. It was a dark journey which a horse had to endure.Whilst it's hard to make light of such a horrible time during the war, there is beauty found in this movie. It was entertaining and witty in parts, not your average blood and guts movie. It made you feel like it wasnt straight out of ""Call Of Duty"".I really loved the fact it wasn't a bloodbath movie. I understand it was a brutal time, but it was great that the movie didn't throw it in your face.I thought I'd be emotional watching this, as anytime animals are a focal point in a movie it always seems to strike me hard, (Bambi....), but I didn't feel the need to hit the tissue box.My honest vote on this is a 7/10.",War Horse
337,mankell,Do I like it?,4,2 February 2012,"no, I do not, a film wonderful executed, great camera work and fine actors,, if one talks about the script , I really do not like it. There are only decent and good characters in it, very good English characters, very good French characters and surprisingly very good Germans. The main character, the horse, equipped with super natural powers,is of course the favorite of any animal loving person, mainly of course the English. So this is a film which did not move the American audience, I can't blame them, a very, very slow and boring film. I assume this is now another film which did not make any money after The Adventures of Tintin (2011), I have all my hope on Lincoln (2012).

338,bamacharm,A truly exceptional film about courage in both man and beast,10,29 December 2011,"This is a wonderful ""against all odds"" inspirational story about courage and relationships. A horse of truly amazing spirit touches the lives of so many during War I - including British soldiers, German soldiers, French civilians and even other horses. I cannot recall any foul language throughout the film. The background and drama are epic. Steven Spielberg will take you through many emotions from humor, to sadness, to tears of joy. The scenery is gorgeous, the acting splendid, and the performances by the animals is simply remarkable. The cinematography has to be the best I've seen in a film. The last scene alone is a masterpiece.Jeremy Irvine as ""Albert"" was particularly outstanding. I was also moved by the performance of French actor Niels Arestrup as the Grandfather and that of Celine Buckens who plays Emilie - his granddaughter. Of course, the War Horse -Joey- steals the show.I cannot give a film any higher recommendation than I give this one. You will be moved to tears. Everyone in the family will enjoy it and you'll be pleased that you ""participated"" because you will be fully invested in this story emotionally.",War Horse

I did not fall asleep during the movie, but staying awake through the torturous 2 hours and 40 minutes was a challenge. Everyone I was with fell asleep and it seemed like half the theater did as well- in the end they got more value for their money than I did. All I can say is I am happy I paid for another film and popped into this one afterward. I am amazed that this is being considered for Oscars, and even more amazed that there are so many positive reviews.... I mean, it's Spielberg, so of course it is going to have pleasing cinematography as well as an array of his favorite actors, but every single development of the film is so incredibly played out- i mean everything: from the opening shots to the closing credits it is painful cliché after painful cliché with the same played out actors playing the same played out roles.I'm sorry... I am so offended by this films warm reception that I can't even critique it properly... When I saw it I was sure that it had fallen flat on its ass and nobody would fall for it. It was like a Mad TV spoof of a Spielberg film. If you were thinking about watching War Horse, you might prefer drowning yourself.",War Horse
340,mmille10-697-57647,"decent, but boring",4,15 May 2012,"The story portrays a young man who instantly falls in love with a horse. His father buys it, also seeing something special in it. The family tries to use it to plow their field, but it turns out for naught. The horse is sold to a military officer at the beginning of WW I. The movie follows the horse through the war, encountering human characters in its travels.I agree with the other reviews in that this was a film adaptation of a play. The screenwriter and Spielberg took it too literally, using archetypes for most of the characters, with actors giving perfunctory performances, coming off wooden in the process. The script needed some work, too. Most of the relationships were contrived. The movie failed to make me care about most of them.It tried to use symbology, and some explicit messaging, to communicate with the audience, but did it badly, leaving it confused. It's possible for a film to use symbolic characters, but it needs to give the audience some clues that this is what it's doing, or else it'll miss the point. It seems to me the movie misses the opportunity by using stereotypes of the era, trying to seem historically accurate, focusing the audience on what it expects, rather than the message of the journey it tries to communicate. It seems to me the one ""character"" that has any development at all is the war itself.Still, the movie had its moments. It has a few charming scenes. The scenes of trench warfare were the most engaging. They had a sense of realism, but they didn't have the epic quality of ""Saving Private Ryan.""The ending was the best part, and I say that in all seriousness. It felt like *finally* SOMEBODY had figured out how to translate some aspect of the story into a movie! The cinematography in this one spot was very good, and the acting is the best in the film. It doesn't make up for the movie's flaws, but it leaves you feeling it wasn't a total waste. For this alone I gave it 4 stars instead of 3.To compare this movie with Private Ryan is a joke. That was a good Spielberg film. In my view, this was one of his worst. Still, it's a passable, decent film. It's not a total chore to sit through it.

I think it would have been so much better, if the Germans spoke German and the french french. It would have worked better (I think) and been more authentic. For example for me (I am danish and have not read the book) I had a bit of a hard time distinguish the french and the German accent from one another, and was confused for a long time whether the girl and the grandfather were German or french.

It uses many stereotypes to get into the Oscars and win some of the statues.Some of the basic ""ingredients"" used by the chef Spielberg:1. A horse in the leading role. 2. A War scenery. 3. Soldiers that stop fighting each other to save the wounded horse in the battlefield.(if it was Christmas they would have played football-soccer). 4. The temporary-blind soldier recognized the wounded horse and vice versa. 5. The ""Weathering Heights""-style ending scene! 6.

343,timgrn,Spielberg or Disney?,3,20 May 2012,"Wow, what an incredible let down this film was. I hardly know where to start but here goes. Horses and foals do not constantly whinny and wicker and generally make a noise all of the time. All males, young and old whether in the army or not had their hair cut VERY short, pudding basin style at that time. Thatch has NEVER been laid on shallow pitched roofs anywhere, the water wouldn't run off and it would rot very quickly. You cannot plough a field with huge gaps between the furrows and then somehow go back and fill them in, creating a perfectly ploughed field. You cannot plough ground that clearly has no soil on it. Soft pliable soil does not ever appear on a previously barren hard stony field even after a shower of rain. Chucking handfuls of some kind of seed into holes made with a stout stick will not ever produce the neat regimented rows of any crop that we saw on the 'Dartmoor' farm. The film sets looked just like film sets, the cottage was particularly poor, I think possibly the same set director / designer that 'designed' 'Larkrise' and 'Candleford' had been at work. Rubbish. The Old man and his 'Allo Allo' granddaughter seemed to be living in the mill vacated by Caractacus Potts and his family in Chitty Chitty Bang Bang. You CAN and often DO put a heavy horse collar on upside down and rotate it around a horses neck just under the jaw before settling it on the shoulder, I know, I've done it. One night of rain wouldn't uproot a field of turnips or anything else for that matter AND if they really had been uprooted fully developed as seemed to be the case in the film the rain would have done them a huge favour. Mills didn't tend to be unattended overnight, they were hugely valuable pieces of equipment and a miller would have been on site at all times. Aside from this small selection of hundreds of pretty daft technical / historical / factual errors the film was almost totally lacking in real passion or feeling. I was expecting to be hiding my watery eyes from my wife and family - I am very soft when it comes to animals - but I couldn't have cared less by the end. Really poor Mr Spielberg, my title might even be a bit of a slur on Disney.",War Horse
344,prometheus_prime,A truly epic movie.,9,9 December 2012,"With a large resume of great movies Spielberg hits it again and makes another wonderful epic movie. With great effects, cinematography and a amazing score made this movie very enjoyable. The characters all did a great heartfelt performance. However I think the real star of the film wasn't the child but the horse. Seeing the movie more from the perspective of the horse was very enjoyable. What Spielberg achieved from the performance of the horse he deserves a lot of praise for that. War horse was a very sentimental film without being too annoying it made you care about the horse and characters. Some of the scenes were very powerful and showed what some of the consequences of war can truly be. Spielberg is in top form with this movie showing he is still one of the best in the industry. The way he achieves the balance from heartfelt emotion, from the war seen through joey's eyes and the people met along the way, and the tragic problems the main characters face. The bond he showed with the horse and the separation and the reconnection at the end were especially moving. That pain and suffering to the excitement translated very well even with the devastation the war had caused. This is a perfect film to see with a family, the touching and beautiful depiction of the relationship between a boy and his horse, and the life of the countryside during a war. Being a war movie a lot of the blood and gore were skipped in favor of a real story that stirs up passion and deep emotion from the audience. With this being a solid family movie this is a must see.",War Horse
345,redskyfilming,"warhorse, war bore",2,10 January 2012,"I personally find it quite extraordinary that people say this is a wonderful achievement in movie making.This movie reminded of Tamara Drew with horses and a few action scenes thrown in. I love a movie that makes me weep and yes, i am a grown man. This movie did nothing for me and my wife when we watched it. Firstly, the dreadful CGI looking village and scenes took me away from something i really wanted to enjoy. The characters, especially the son who reared the horse were so one dimensional and the grandfather was quite frankly as good as a cardboard cutout. Secondly, the scene where the Indian scout has guaranteed his mission and informed the general what to do with his troops. Five minutes later they are shot to bits. Two minutes prior to this the general had uttered the comment "" it shows you what good recognizance can do""..great joke. The fighting scenes were all quite tame. Considering the troops all fixed their bayonets and the fact that this type of fighting was commonplace in world war 1, we saw not one bayonet kill. The aforementioned charge by the British cavalry saw some swinging blades and a few kills, but certainly no gore whatsoever. I for one applaud this to a point. However, this sort of tame fighting did not deserve any film certification except 'ideal for 10 year olds'. As the mini stories surrounding the fate of the horse continued to spill out, they became more boring. The old man and his daughter section was horrible. There is a scene in the movie ""Life Of Brian"" where the Romans invade a house trying to find various people hiding in the most ridiculous places such as baskets and behind a curtain. Certainly a classic scene that i was convinced would never be bettered in my lifetime...but hiding two bloody huge stallions in a girls bedroom as the Germans remark ""Vot Vos that noise""..absolutely hilarious. The script was appalling. As the girl rides over the hill the father chases after her when he hears cries for help. As he reaches the top of the hill, the girl is surrounded by a huge battalion of (very quiet) German troops trying to pull her from the horse ON THE OTHER SIDE OF A LAKE. How did she get there and in 30 seconds-remarkable achievement.Good jump. The two boys who were shot in the previous section were lucky to get out of the movie. All this may seem harsh, but c'mon...this is Spielberg. The man is obviously now on mortgage payment row and simply taking money for nothing. He is capable of far better than this, surely. On a closing note. The best scene in the movie was the meeting of the two troops from either side as they disentangle the wire from super horse. This was really funny. Don't know if it was meant to be, but i laughed out loud.""Another pair of wire cutters i suggest"". ""I speak English well"", the German corrects the Englishman for saying "" you speak English good"". Sounds like Britain today. As the old man turned up at the end of the movie looking like chef Anthony Wirrel Thompson back from a Tesco raid, he purchased the horse in memory of his daughter (what happened to her we have no idea-dead i suppose)only to hand the horse over to the young Brit and walk off into the distance. This brings us to the dreadful closing scenes as the young lad and Joe the horse (now back in Blighty) ride back to the farm with the sun creating a ridiculous glowing affect on all and sundry. Emily Watson smiles as if relieved that the movie is about to finish, while the grandfather has one of the most cringe worthy greetings ever recorded. Saving Private Ryan. Save Joe the Horse.

349,ibn-e-azhar,An Average Movie from a legendary Director.....,6,7 December 2012,"Steven Spielberg's name is enough for a movie to expect a lot and for most of the times his movies meets expectations. War Horse is an exception. It is based on a 1982 Novel for children which was later adopted for a theatrical performance in Britain. It is story of human-animal bond and tells how luck takes Joey-the horse from one place to another in the backdrop of World War-I.Steven Spielberg is a WW-II centric director and admitted that he was never interested in WW-I until the idea of War Horse came. His famous WW-II based movies, six in total include master pieces like ""Schindler's List"" (1993 Oscar) as well as ""Saving Private Rayn"".Keeping Spielberg's big name in mind ""War Horse"" fails to deliver. Since the original book was for the children so the simplicity of the movie itself makes it not a delightful experience for elder audience. Two awesome scenes from the movie include girl trying to train the horse and the climax scene with Joey entangled in barbed wire. Keeping in view the ""War"" genre of the movie in context, there is not much in the movie from the military aspect as well, except an average looking Battle of Somme Scene and the impressive British Horseback charge on Germans.On the sidelines, movie urges to know about animatronics and American Humane Association.Over all ""Sam's Movie Index"" rating is 62.(It's my own devised scale) Direction: 8/10, Story/Script:6/10, Cinematography:6/10, Music:6/10,Acting: 7/10,Editing: 6/10, Purposefulness: 6/10, Special Effects:6/10, Entertainment Value: 5/10, Overall Impact Value: 6/10TOTAL SCORE: 62/100",War Horse

The war scenes have been filmed in a sensitive and honest manner, there is no glorifying war here simply an illustration of a very human experience told through the life of the lead character the ""war horse"".

There are many new faces as well as some more well known actors such as Benedict Cumberbatch and David Thewlis. Jeremy Irvine plays the part of Albert brilliantly and gives a very convincing performance as a young farmers boy from Devon. His friendship with Joey the horse really is moving, and its Joeys dedication to Albert that really keeps the film going. You will really come to love him as he is raised by Albert, bought by a British cavalry officer (portrayed perfectly by Tom Hiddleston) and even captured by the Germans.

If this was meant for an adult audience it would have been great to press an R rating with battle scenes like in every other war movie. Some parts of this movie are so fluffy I felt like I was watching a cartoon. Soooo you're stuck between to graphic for children and not enough realism for adults.The acting is good but the script is choppy and you don't feel much connection with the characters because they are short lived.I just would have liked more out this movie.

There seems to be people who cannot embrace a work of great beauty. It seems to be the case now alas.This film is a Spielberg Masterpiece make absolutely no doubt about that. It is one of his top 5 films in my opinion.Where do I start about what is so special about this film ? The story is so well told. A book written for children about this lost period of time , World War One. A film that has gone out to try and educate children of this conflict and the horrible waste of Men and Horse surely has to be applauded on that one premise alone ? The fact the film has great acting all the way through with a cast of very highly regarded British talent who deliver spot on performances from Emily Watson as the fierce, protective guardian of "" her family"". To Mullins who plays the broken but ultimately loving Father who has lost his way in the World to Irvine who was perfect for this role and should have gained acting award nominations in my opinion to the other cast, all round superb.To the numerous, momentous scenes of sheer brilliance such as the cavalry charge with men and horses with swords finding machine guns facing them. To the panning back of the shot from Spielberg about the carnage of the attack with hundreds of men and horses dead and strewn on the battlefield.To the scenes of the horses as collateral damage , worth nothing more than a means to and end. To the changing of the warfare to the big guns, shown with a bravura scene of the men in their trenches faces being lit up with the shock and awe of experiencing a type of devastating warfare never been seen before. To the battle on the Somme with the utter carnage and hopelessness of it all.To the very moving scene with Joey and the Black horse dying having been through it all together for four years. To the technically superlative scenes of Joey running through the battlefields and the scene with the English and German solider coming together to help with their respect to the War Horse.To the scenes at the end with the reunion and then problems to be finally resolved by the kindly Grandfather.Lets not forget the end scenes with the gorgeous use of the natural light of the Devon sunset.

359,bmcd10,"The Epic, Most Emotional Film of the Year",10,2 January 2012,"What War Horse aimed to do is something that many films try to do every year: make you cry. Few films ever make the majority of the audience cry, and most films just fail miserably. But, War Horse not only happens to be one of those few films this year; it is one of the few films this century that has ever made the entire audience shed a tear. I personally believe that anyone who doesn't cry during this film is either comatose or cold-hearted. Spielberg has made a film as epic as Star Wars with the same emotional power as Titanic or, dare I say, Marly & Me (I mean, if you ever went to a screening of that film, you would see every single woman balling their eyes out at the end). Furthermore, the film has some pretty inspirational pieces to it.Richard Curtis is the screenwriter for this lovely film. This is definitely surprising occurrence since Curtis is primarily known for his Romantic Comedies, such as Love Actually, Bridget Jones's Diary, and Four Weddings and a Funeral. Mostly excellent films by the way, but there are no war/drama pictures in his resume. Most filmmakers who branch out of their typical genres usually fail, but we are fortunate enough to see one of them who didn't. As you may have already discovered, this film is centered around a horse. But it not only that, because we follow the horse and observe its surrounding plots. We experience a boy and his family, who raised the horse. Then, the Great War begins and Joey, the first name given to the horse, is sold to an officer in the British calvary. And not to give anything away, but Joey is given a couple more names by the end of the film.The film explores the topics of bravery and cowardice, as do all war films. However, I believe this film does have some original insights that I think many of you would find interesting or even inspiring. World War I films are certainly scarce in number (since there is more of an appeal towards WW2 films), but WW1 films are typically abundant with emotions and true feelings. The first world war is very unique in the way that it is possible to imagine each side being just as right and just as wrong as the other. In fact, this is one of the first wars where there was a general consensus among soldiers on both sides that they had no idea what they were fighting for. There is a scene in the film where a British soldier, a German soldier, and Joey interact without any thoughts of killing one another but rather helping one another. I just want to point out something that you might not know: scenes like that actually happened. There were occasional brief truces between the two sides where the soldiers would interact with each other in a civil way. I love WW1 movies for that exact reason; in the depths of human despair and peril, there is a slight flash of an optimistic light that shines through and inspires people to help and not to kill. As far as the awards go, War Horse should be nominated for a boatload of awards. I would personally be surprised if they won any of them (with the exception of John Williams, the composer, who will win Best Score), but they deserve to be nominated nonetheless. War Horse is truly a perfectly made film. It draws people's emotions so effectively and truly touches their hearts (Sorry for being cliché). I love this movie as should the majority of you.I highly recommend that you most definitely see this film",War Horse

And what I was expecting pretty much came true. I thoroughly enjoyed this movie and consider it to be another one of Spielberg's greats. There were only a few problems I had with the movie, but were easily forgiven. The first problem I had was that the first act of the movie moved a little on the slow side, and seemed to have some trouble creating audience investment through character development. And the second problem I had was that the acting wasn't always top notch, and the script contained some very weak and clichéd dialogue. Another thing that slightly bothered me but wasn't a real problem, was that the French and German characters were all speaking English. I understand why he chose to have everyone speak English but I would have just preferred to hear the true languages spoken. Other than those minor issues, I think the movie is pretty great. Once the war began in the film, it really took off for me and did not let up until the end. I think that Spielberg created some extremely masterful shots and scenes in this film that really stick in the viewer's mind. (ie: the shot of the soldier walking out into no man's land to help Joey). Also, i found the depiction of The Somme to be stunning; it literally left me breathless. As usual, the cinematography in this film was gorgeous, and the score by John Williams was one of his best yet. Overall, War Horse is a great film that has the power to sweep the viewer into the movie and get lost in the wonder of Spielberg's magic.",War Horse
361,bolbasor01,unfortunately not what I expected,5,14 June 2012,"The main reasons I watched this film was because of the Oscar nominations and the fact that it was directed by a master of film. Unfortunately I didn't really submerge into the film as much as I wanted to because the film does not allow you too. There is a main plot that branches into five other plots. In other words, one can divide this film into five other films with the same impact. Because of this, the film moves very quickly and does not allow you to really connect to the different,and extraordinary relationship between the horse and another character. Also, there are certain unneeded scenes that are places not as fillers but as tear puller(I guess), which do not really accomplish anything because of the wrong timing and lack of depth. The film does get better and interesting in the middle, mostly because I really enjoyed Saving Private Ryan and Spirit, and the film really reflects similar scenes from both films and I did not mind. I did enjoy certain techniques used in the film like the color and shades (lighting) of the film, which were very well executed. Also the score was interesting. I'm not going to say its a disappointment but I expected more.",War Horse

363,sonjarajic,Just like a light at the end of the tunnel...,10,3 February 2012,"One of a kind.Well, I hate those kind of lemonade-love-story-no-message-sending kinds of movies. And when I say this, trust me- War Horse is NOTHING like that. It's that touching, sad, beautiful kind of movie that sends a message to this world. It has a point and anybody who doesn't like it doesn't understand it. I drooled. I cried. Seriously. It touched me like nothing in a long time did. I'm not superficial, it wasn't because a horse died or because it's about a war, no for heaven's sake that sorts of things happen whether we wanted it or not. This is just a movie so we see it first- hand. But when we hear it in the news it doesn't sound that terrifying, doesn't it? I cried because it reminded me that there still is hope for us with people like that. Because of the goodness in it. First of all, we are all humans, whether we're Germans or English or from any other country in this world. We fight and kill our own brothers on what bases? Because some man that we've never even met told us so? Or because of issues of a man who sits behind a big wooden desk and therefore is better than all of us. There still is hope that goodness exists.There's an English soldier on one side. Horse in the middle and German on the other side. The war stands still, nothing is moving, everything seems like in peace for that one moment. In that moment they are not enemies, just two ordinary men trying to save a life of that noble, gorgeous creature. It is the only thing that is connecting those two men from the other sides. Horse and their own kindness. In that moment politic doesn't matter, neither is some stupid rule that says: I'm a German, you're French or English- we have to hate each other, only thing that does is saving a life.Well, I think that was enough of my philosophizing, but I'm just going to say that the crew was amazing, actors were awesome and Spielberg did a splendid job, he saw it like nobody else could and then presented it to us. Really phenomenal, i have none objections whatsoever.I recommend this movie to every one of you, especially those of you who lost hope. I hope this review helped. :)",War Horse
364,jpvbm,Who's the main character?,7,2 March 2013,"At tender age he was taken from his mother's company and sent to work on the fields, harvesting potatoes. Shortly after that he was forcibly enlisted to fight alongside the Brits at the great war, then captured by the Germans, put on excruciating forced labour, pulling heavy artillery pieces until he was able to escape, and, on crossing ""no man's land"", got injured by the barbed wire, and, finally, was reunited with his former master. No, this is no human slave of any sort, neither any subject of the British Empire. Actually, the character is a horse, as this movie depicts its wanderings through Europe during the war. One of Steven Spielberg's greatest virtues, as a director, is his capability to humanize everything he wants, ranging from animals even to extraterrestrials.Right from the beginning of the movie the horse displays emotions that are common to ourselves, thus creating that bond with the viewer I usually refer to. Curious as it may seem, the animal's fate is the main element of the story, and the humans are portrayed in a kind of incidental way. Even the leading human role, played by the young actor Jeremy Irvine, does not stand as a usual main character. He is almost absent during the entire middle term of the film, and his grievances are shown only to the point when it matters to his relation with the horse. But Steven Spielberg is such a great story teller that his argument works well and, on seeing ""War Horse"", we actually think about ourselves, about our own path on the wretched world we live in.War Horse is not a war movie. Here the belligerence serves as a painful background on which the story is told. So the war could be replaced with a separation, an illness, a famine or some misfortune of the sort. What is of real importance here are the constant changes we are submitted during our lives, and how diminute sometimes is our grip over our own destiny. Future, as this movie asserts, can occasionally play tricks on us, for better or for worse. The outright conclusion is that usual, but often forgotten, realization to responsibly enjoy good times as they happenThe movie went alright till almost it's very end. Here Spielberg committed a fault that is comprehensible, but difficult to forgive. Human experience has for long acquired the notion that life moves forward. For instance, it's natural that everyone, from a certain point onwards, begins to earn its own living. Being this simple notion applicable to almost anything else regarding our lives, we perceive Mr. Spielberg inverted that order. When the young Irvine accomplishes the trials leading to his adulthood (he survives the trenches), and is expected to get on with his life, he somewhat does the opposite way: he gets back to his mommy's arms. As stated, it's understandable, because the director's desire was to end the movie with a definite sense of safety, of shelter from the unpredictable. But life is unforeseeable, and keeps moving on. Therefore, it would have been a more according finish if the young man had followed the french bidder, taking the animal to the girl, thus binding the loose links established over the movie, and just 'moving on' from that point. It would have been uncertain, but more feasible. On the other hand stands Robert Zemeckis's ""Cast Away"" (2000), presenting us a much more credible finale, as Tom Hanks does not return to his sweetheart (although she more than hints she would accept), choosing to take the unknown path of knocking on a stranger's door.""War Horse"" is great entertainment.",War Horse
365,Ajaymib,What a beautiful movie,8,27 May 2016,"...yeah such a nice horse movie, shows the unfailing bond between a young lad and his horse.., the tenacity, strength, speed and courage of the horse. Didn't know that horses were so intelligent (or are they in actuality?) to be of sacrificing nature (one scene shows this quality of the horse).That scene in which an English and the German soldier lend a hand together to free the horse from the barbed wire in which it is stuck, is so pleasing to see. And i would say, the horse has been made quite lucky in the movie as it faces quite a tough time several times but manages to survive. anyone who sees it, immediately consider's him as so much likable...Beautiful picturization, beautiful location, beautiful story. Worth the watch.. and why not, its Steven Spielberg movie.",War Horse
366,mishrust,An Epic Tale,7,6 August 2021,"Such a grand story, told over various places over the first world war. Starting in England, this horse against all odds makes the owner proud. The horse gets into the war, I wont say how, except that its lumpy throat time.We see all sides of the war, from the French to the Germans and back to the British. Each side has a few characters who take special notice of this special horse.With a massive cast including Tom Hiddleston, Benedict Cumberbatch, Eddie Marson, Bruno Ganz, David Thewlis , Emma Watson and Peter Mullan, all play their roles exceptionally well and the direction is first class, as you might expect.If there is any downside to this film, its the heavy handed message of war and the perhaps unrealistic actions of the horse that pop up time and time again. Despite this, the overall feel is not artificial and you can easily be swept up by the range of the emotions by the dramatic plot.An underdog story of hope, dedication and fearlessness.",War Horse
367,dillett-2007,The dilemma when the Germans are more British than the British?,5,21 September 2012,"I resisted 'War Horse' for a considerable period of time. It reeked of cliché and melodrama from afar. But, disappointingly, it met every cliché I think I could possibly think of when I finally saw it. I was ready to be taken on a roller coaster tale of history, death, emotion and survival. However, although all these themes were throughout 'War Horse', they're so formulaic, so contrived, that all the emotion of John Williams' impressive musical score is all but lost. The beauty of the cinematography is quite undeniably of high-quality, there's no argument there. But if you want to see spectacular cinematography look no further than David Fincher's 'Girl With The Dragon Tattoo' or 'The Assassination of Jesse James by The Coward Robert Ford', at least they have a decent and compelling narrative accompanying the highest level of imagery. Let me note why the story disappointed me so. There is an unending line of characters that are introduced, provided with a story (of minor degrees) and then thoroughly disposed with once a particular lesson has been supposedly learn't. You see, through the horses 'adventure' through the field of battle he is owned or controlled by a variety of people, French, German and the English having lost his original owner and the protagonist of 'War Horse'. Some teach him how to pull, how to jump, how to be determined and trustworthy. Undoubtedly, Spielberg gets across what he's trying to evoke in these relationships - but I felt as I watched 'War Horse' Spielberg poking me saying 'look, look, he's tilted his head, he's learn't, he's learn't that he has to leave and say goodbye, doesn't that make you sad? C'mon Cry, cry for 'Spiely'.Well I say 'NO', you can't just throw a tough situation, some damaged characters, and ambitions into a story shake it up and call it a film. Nothing is learn't, the trials of one of the most decimating and destructive things that has ever occurred on our planet, our war with Germany, was 'barely' noted. Other than the odd extra clinging onto a bloody stump of a limb saying 'Nurse...nurse' with one eye covered with a bandage..........WE ALL KNOW HE'S JUST BENT HIS LEG AND THE REST OF HIS LIMB IS HIDDEN IN THE TABLE YOUR PROP GUY CUT A HOLE INTO! You- won't-get-a-way-with-it-------any-more. And the Germans.....It's like an awful parody. Even the German actors appear parodied. I felt like screaming to the screen 'WHY ARE YOU SPEAKING English? You're a Nazi, on the German front line, why are you SPEAKING IN THE LANGUAGE OF THE PEOPLE YOU'VE BEEN ORDERED TO KILL?!' Oh yes, but order the march into battle in German just to remind the audience that it wasn't the British who the British were fighting in the First World War........I know some people don't like subtitles. But COME ON, even George Lucas has the jump on you on this time Spielberg. I see why we have 'War Horse' - the image of a tormented world seen through the eyes of a child is classic Spielberg. That's what he does. But this has really done nothing but highlight the downward spectrum of his films. How did we come from 'E.T.' to this. You need to go away Steven, and take a long hard look at yourself, and think about what you have done...",War Horse
368,folk-rainbowfan,"Great War Movie, if you're 5 years old",8,28 December 2011,"I'm a huge Spielberg fan, but I think he could have done much better than this. The fact that he tried to make the movie and the story child friendly was quite unnecessary. The setting of the movie isn't child friendly at all, and although my 9 year old half brother saw it with me, it still could have been considered inappropriate even for him, and I know the rating is PG-13, but that makes no difference. Almost everything nowadays is rated R, all it requires is a little action, a little sex, and some not-so-nice language. However, there is no sex in this movie; hopefully, this doesn't spoil it for anyone, and it shouldn't, but if you're looking for sex, don't watch it. That being said, if there's absolutely no sex or anything like that present, why make the violence kid friendly? We need to see some blood, maybe some agony or grief, but we must certainly not augment what really happened in that time period, such as, we see the violence take place, and we know just how barbaric it really is, but aside from only a couple scenes of the movie, where's the rest of the story? Spielberg is essentially pulling a Pulp Fiction, but instead of going from chapter to chapter, going back and forth in time, he's bouncing between multiple characters, and when this happens, you tend to become frustrated with all the characters being introduced. This is the main argument I have about the movie. That being said, the movie was wonderful. The characters and plot could have been better, but the credit that is given in the movie is astounding. I could swear that the Germans in the movie were given more credit than anyone else in the film; however, their role was infamous. Despite this infamy, the Germans were also portrayed as ""not so evil"" or ""not so bad"" in some parts, which kind of relieves the viewer of the barbarity that is seen in textbooks and in the explosive rhetoric of some high school and college level instructors. But then again, we should see a lot more of the barbarity if we are to believe it, and be saddened by it; then again, the movie is rated PG-13. I was expecting Saving Private Ryan, and I wound up getting E.T. all over again, only this time during World War I. Do I highly recommend it? Yes. Would I recommend buying it when it comes out on DVD and/or Blu-ray? No. Hope this helps!",War Horse

And the book should be read too. Both are great. They were sad at times, but still great.And the movie is very much like the book.

370,chrisc-o,A safe movie.,5,1 May 2012,"Going into this review I've forgotten the names of all the characters except the horse, Joey, which goes to show how much work War Horse puts into their non-horse characters.War Horse is pretty much the definition of a safe, mediocre movie. Nothing unexpected happens, there's no deeper message, Joey lives and generic best friend character to the human protagonist who joins the military dies (then we, along with every other character, forgets he existed within a few seconds). It did have its good moments, including the thrilling scene where Joey runs through no-man's land. That being said all the horse drama is diluted by the fact that all the human characters are completely boring, lack any sense of being important (again, generic best friend character) and left totally undeveloped. Another thing that's annoying is they never shut up about how amazing the horse is. I understands its the premise of the movie, but every ten seconds it seems somebody is saying ""Look at this horse, this horse is amazing!"" If you don't want anything that will challenge you intellectually and you don't mind all the human characters being bland then go ahead and view it, you might actually cry when the other horse dies (the movie makes you feel more than you did when the human best friend dies). However if you're looking for something will a little depth and complexity you'll be sorely disappointed.",War Horse
371,Crazyfilmreviewer,Terrible Tripe,1,23 October 2012,"Wow where do i start with this garbage. The only things missing here in this film was if the horse went on to win a Nobel Prize for Peace, won a couple of Grand Nationals at Aintree then emigrated to the states to fight crime by taking on Chicago mobsters. How this film got nominated for 6 Oscars really says a lot about the selection process these days. This film is terrible. If they cut back a few of the war scenes then it could have been marketed for young teenage girls. Watched the film all the way through hoping it could turn its self around somehow. The part where Joey ( Warhorse ) saves the black horse from pulling artillery up a hill was the final straw for me. In summary - This film is stupid and you must be sort of mentally challenged in the head to even think this is any good.",War Horse

I generally do not like Steven Spielberg movies and I really don't like war movies. But I'm in a film group and this was one of our films for the coming session.I was hopeful when I saw Peter Mullan in the film - one of my favorite actors. But he is a secondary actor and not in this enough. Other actors would appear that I like but they felt like caricatures.But what really threw me was the look of the movie. The first act looks like a Disney movie. The colors are so saturated as to look unreal. Perhaps this is to set up a contrast for the third act (which I never even made it to but saw in a ""making of"" piece) but I did not feel like I was looking at a real turn of the century village. The irony is that this wasn't a set. There is a village that looks that charming. But, again, it wasn't the look of the village on its own, it was the deep, clean and crisp colors that didn't look quite right to me and made me feel like I was not watching a movie about this historical period.",War Horse

377,mairire,"Artificial, overwrought and overtly sentimental",6,25 December 2013,"There is approximately 15 minutes of this movie that are strong, emotional but not sentimental. And all 15 of them are inhabited by Tom Hiddleston and Benedict Cumberbatch. Way better performances than this movie deserves, masterful and real. The only part that doesn't drag and doesn't feel tepid. The movie is, however, exactly what I have expected, sentimental, too clean and over the top, war for kids. What I did not expect was disjointed story without the point, that comes into focus and delivers some true drama only in those 15 mentioned minutes. Just look at Hiddlestones face in those last moments we see him. No one bothered to decide if this was a kids movie about a brave horse, or true war drama. It fails in both respects. Spielberg likes clean universes (how did Private Ryan happen?) for his stories, he cleans them up until they feel sterile. For some stories it works. For most, it does not. This movie leaves you waiting for the true drama to start. The horse and the boy have never been in any kind of danger. The connection they had wasn't so much in the chemistry as it was spoken out. And that holds for mostly everyone facing Joey. It feels like without musical cues (straight out of 50s melodramas, and completely outdated) you would never know what you are supposed to feel. Not that it renders more than awww factor at any point.",War Horse

It was with dire impatience that my friend and me waited for this cinematographic torture to end, almost crying at the end... in desperation. Cans of mustard gas thrown from the screen into the audience would have been a welcome respite from this atrocity. Don't get me wrong - if someone loved Free Willy, they'll love this; and good for them. I however wouldn't recommend this to my most hated enemy. Personal opinion - as is the rest of this text. I thought Janusz Kaminski did his usual decent work with the camera, only to have it deformed and mangled in the editing computers by colour- contrast-crazy digital editors. The lighting in many scenes was completely out of character, often outright bad. (Do peasants have halogen beams growing in their gardens?) The dialogues were poor, to say the least. The acting was uneven - believable in places, almost drawing the viewer in - only to disappointingly dislocate any suspension of disbelief in the next scene. Perhaps the actors are not entirely to blame - it might be all they could manage with such poor script.The predictability of this film could only be matched by a third grade Nepalese Bollywood picture, which would prove much more entertaining - at least they don't take themselves as seriously. The ending was not dramatic, as was no doubt intended. It was ridiculous. To top this cake of despair oozing with emotional hogwash, John Williams delivers a score that only serves to highlight the gross negligence committed on the viewers' nerves.Mr Spielberg has created some decent films in the past, but God only knows what drove him to commit such a parody.

However, a film by Spielberg, over a rather unusual and sensitive theme seemed attractive enough. It was rather long but fell short of my expectations...I found the storyline rather shallow and had the impression that Spielberg tried to compensate this by visual atmospheres : a few nice and rather moving scenes of the English countryside and the battlefields as well as many lighting effects (horse running through the no man's land at night, Albert returning home over a sunset more reminiscent of Hawaii than of Dorset...). This was far, far away from the poetry and effects of E.T...I also found totally ridiculous to have the German and french characters speaking (rather grammatically good) English, albeit with a unique and quite strange accent.

And possibly the worst scene in this stupid movie is the scene of Tommy and Jerry flipping a coin to determine ownership of the horse after a silly encounter in no-man's land.

383,substance24,"A very well-made film, but slightly flawed.",8,25 December 2011,"To begin, this film is beautiful. Every shot is so achingly gorgeous it lets me remember why I love Steven Spielberg. There are many classic Spielberg shots and lighting techniques that fans will recognize, especially during the battle sequences. In addition, the score is wonderful, and was one of my favorite parts of the movie.As you probably already know, the story is told through the horse's (Joey's) eyes. He is raised from birth by a boy named Albert, is then sold to the British Army, and continues to be passed from one hand to the next. While the story flows well, and the transitions between vignettes are smoothly done, they don't leave much room for character development. Most notable is the story of the little French girl and her grandfather. Though I won't spoil it for anyone, I'll just say that it left me feeling unsatisfied, like the story hadn't gone anywhere.If the characters had been better written, or had been given more time to develop, I would care more for them. This is where I think the movie fails. It spends all its time trying to make the audience care for its equestrian hero, but doesn't allow very well-developed human anchors.That being said, there were moments that moved me. At several moments in the film, I thought about how I could see this being a Best Picture contender for this year's Academy Awards.

The settings and visuals were generally not that bad, with Benedict Cumberbatch and Emily Watson, probably the better known names in a large cast, making the best of a less than impressive, maybe even fanciful, script.

At times, this gave the movie a sentimental, nostalgic feel, but at others it makes scenes drag on in the midst of embarrassingly bad delivery from some of the cast. I'm really looking at Emily Watson (Rose) and Niels Arestrup (the French grandfather) here, but pretty much all the minor characters also suffer from this.I enjoyed War Horse more than most of the other films I watched this year, but it's still not that memorable.",War Horse
386,tubal_cains,Could have been so much more................,5,12 January 2012,"The main problem was that this seems to be neither a dramatic war film or an inspiring horse film. It results in a collage of separate scenes cobbled together to make a run of the mill ""family film"". I'm afraid it was that gooey stuff that's meant to be endearing but turns out shallow.Trying to build, cement and then end a relationship in 10 minutes didn't work, I hark back to the film The Yellow Rolls-Royce, the different events in different times worked because they didn't try to make them fit. These appear so transitory, except for the Albert Narracot character, make you wonder was it adding to the story? Considering the ill-fortune that seems to follow the horse around, who is called WARHORSE a couple of times near the end, for the hard of thinking in case we didn't get it,that I would think that they were sorry they met him.Too many incredible bits, I half expected the horse to start talking. The barbed wire scene was sad, and I mean sad as in cringeworthy, not an ounce of tension in what should have been a defining scene. Why did the French farmer pay all that money and then just say ""hey ho"". The baddies are only recognisable as baddies because they are wearing German uniforms, The real give away was the Devonian traits, one they are not nearly so intelligible as that, every Devonian pub has a subtitles machine for visitors, and two they are credited with way too much intelligence. The nod to reality being that the horse is quite clearly the mensa candidate in the initial scenes. All in all sloppy tosh Black beauty meets A year in Provence",War Horse

First of all, this was the best movie Steven Spielberg has made in so many years! The concept of horses was always overexposed and the reason to give a material that made people cry but in this movie, it was about 2 and a half hours, I watched it with my eyes wide open and enjoyed every second of it. Things happen unexpectedly, not in a cliché way. You will be stunned by the performance. The picture is fabulous. It's nominated for an award on that matter. The outline is taken from a book, which I've read before I saw the movie and I can say for the first time that the movie was far better than the book. The acting is great. The actors and actresses aren't very known pretty-faced people which makes the movie more special. Because you actually go see the film for it's appeal, not the people's. Let's see why I gave it a 10. 2 points I gave for the plot and the well-written screenplay. 3 points for the visual effects, the picture. 2 points for the director who planned each scene in such a way that it feels as if you were in the battle watching it lively. 2 points for the actors' stunning performance. 1 point for the unexpected events. It's a great movie. You should absolutely watch it. It also visualizes the social pressure and superiority of the high class society and the cruelty of the soldiers who thought they were the high class people for killing innocents.",War Horse

Steven Spielberg, undoubtedly known by one of the most influential film directors of all times brings a must see movie; in fact, this film is nominated for six Oscars; it has five winnings and another thirty-three nominations. This will make you shed tears of happiness and sadness all around. War Horse is a different kind of ""War Movie"" where unwavering love, friendship and loyalty transcends any barrier built by human race.Moreover, widescreen landscapes are replete with verdant fields in the old United Kingdom. Albert Narracott (Jeremy Irvine) as well as Rose Narracott (Emily Watson) and a big array of talented actors made this movie the blockbuster it is today. The cinematographic elements as well as Joey (horse) were incredibly outstanding and almost real.Joey It's a vivid example of how animals aren't just animals.

Ignore all the heartless, soulless, emotionless people who say this is just another cliché war movie, because it is NOT!! This is a thrilling, tear-jerking, incredible story of a horse's incredible journey to get home. You can clearly see the love between him and his owner. I saw this movie both the day it came out and the day after, and it made me both cry and smile both times! It is just one of those movies that you can watch over and over and it never gets old! This is NOT some stupid, sappy movie and is NOT a chick flick, it is incredible for people of all genders, not recommended for younger children though because of how sad and emotional and scary some parts may be to them. Again, don't pay attention to the reviews that say this movie is no good, I believe it is one of Spielberg's best! I think it should've won a golden globe...just saying ;) I HIGHLY recommend this movie for everyone (13 and older) as long as you're willing to get a little emotional and teary eyed (if you have a heart that is).

390,steele-linden,Animal suffering is a shame but what about the human suffering?,7,26 December 2011,"It's not as if War Horse sanitizes war—the carnage is graphically depicted, but there 's something strange and disconcerting about a story in which men come together and look out for the safety and welfare of an animal, however beautiful the horse in this case, when the suffering of human beings is gargantuan. Such empathy under such egregious conditions could seem all the more humane and humanistic, but it doesn't quite work, doesn't ring true or proper. It seems forced and sentimental. I'm told my comments are not long enough for this venue. I'm not sure I understand the point of such a limitation, and must say I don't see the wisdom of it. Most of the ""reviews"" here are quite wordy.",War Horse
391,EddardWinterhammer,More complex than it would seem.,8,2 April 2012,"I was ready to dislike this movie when I walked into the cinema, thinking it would just be a shamelessly cheesy movie about a boy fascinated with a horse. Still, I was curious about it, because of a few glowing reviews I had read, because of its Best Picture nomination at the Oscars, and because it came from Spielberg.The first scenes in this movie were indeed overly sentimental. I did not like the musical choices, which spoiled the magnificent images of the idyllic countryside, or the unsubtle relationship between Albert and his horse. Still, I felt there was potential in the elegant and vaguely sinister performance of David Thewlis as the landlord.Then, the horse left to war with a man whose face I felt I possibly recognized. A few scenes later, I was almost sure of his identity, and I was right indeed: this actor was Tom Hiddleston, whom I had seen in ""Thor"", and I had thought back then he was the best thing about that film by far. In fact, he doesn't have much to do here, but he allows Spielberg to lay the foundations for future events of the film. For example, the fight scenes he takes part in are choreographed in a very methodical way that gives the viewer a precise understanding of everything that is going on, and shows both Spielberg's mastery of film and the true horrors of war. Of course, this is only an introduction, and Spielberg ends up sprinkling this motif throughout the artwork.In the end, this is what I will remember of this film: it was neither too bold nor too shy about violence, and I felt Spielberg really made a point of recreating the war and emphasizing the emotional, physical and psychological ordeal it was. Even the horses share that experience in the movie : what I mean is, most war films are shown through the eyes of human characters, but this film deals with the point of view and feelings of the horses as well. Sometimes the film deliberately slows down to examine the casualties (human or animal), or the fears of a given character, and the emotions really come through even if the actors say nothing that could disclose their state of mind.It must also be said that, although Spielberg uses many different tones and presents many different ideas, the movie is very consistent overall. Many introspective parts of the movie feel like dreams and even acquire a mythical dimension. The way the characters behave with Joey often contributes to this feeling, and it forces you to view the film (and indeed, the conflict) in a whole different light. Still, I felt that at times, the poetry of the film was unwelcome, and realistic scenes sometimes became entirely symbolical without much transition. This is particularly true of the first scenes and the final scenes of the movie.On the whole, then, a movie that chooses to acknowledge that its subject is very emotional, and by doing so manages to transcend its inherent limitations and provide the viewer with a layered, beautiful cinematic survey of war.",War Horse
392,tphilpott,"""Warhorse"" (AKA ""Whatever: a melodrama"")",6,27 February 2012,"Warhorse is a very good filmfor the '90s. The characters are two dimensional, which is often the case with Spielberg films. I don't know what it is with this guy, but he has an annoying tendency to make incredibly formulaic films (exception: Shindler's List). The production is close to perfect, but all too often staged (rain with limited drops, etc.) which makes it lose the grittiness which is increasingly common in films of this century. There are pathetically emotive devices he uses, including the ploughing of the film for the first time with the over the top score. Yes, the score. The uninspired, patronizing scoreJohn Williams, a 20th century icon, the compose of Star Wars, now composing while asleep. Please go and enjoy your millions and just leave us alone, John. We'll survive, I promise.The characters. Awful development. Stephen, what were you thinking? I hope you don't actually think you deserve your nomination, as it will mean more of the same schlock. The landlord is so unlikable. The ""badness"" of the ""evil"" characters is so evident. People are rarely that simple and, when they are, they are just boring. ***spoiler alert*** This review contains a number of spoilers from hereon.Do we really care when the son, whom we have no yet properly grown to care for, is so tired that he is collapses next to the horse and the ploughed field? No, because it was too easy. The compulsory training sequence where he is outrunning the car with the horse is incredibly cheesy and predictable annoying. It was obvious that he would bump into the driver of the car again on the front lines, although a surprise the girl never came back into it, as the setup had been done.The whistling makes it obvious that he will have to summon the horse with it later on, although the way it was eventually done was far less dramatic then it could have been. The annoying officer who takes him on is too much of a goody two shoes. So dull and perfect. The best character is the father, who is incredibly flawed (thank God for one flawed character which almost has a third dimension). Characters from other countries with bad accents? Don't get me started. Why would they have trouble speaking in their own language? Cinematography? Yes, it was very good, but too good. The lighting often looked very artificial, even outdoors. In the medium shots, I felt like I was looking at the Sound of Music. I could go on with the 1+2+3 plot points in the storyline, the dull dialogue, etc. but I don't want to bore you too much.

The rest seemed like an over the top paean to Black Beauty: survival assured (Dad made it - whew! - had me holding my breath!), but not much joy. A 99.5% improvement in areas of dialogue/contrived situations would have helped, but still not my type of movie. Just discovered why these reviews are so wordy. Ten line minimum.

I had not seen any trailers as when i heard about the film being made and that Mr Spielberg himself would be directing it i wanted to go in with no expectations or knowledge about the film. And i have to say i really really enjoyed it. this is the type of film that i would call a real film. Something with a good fantastical story with moments that make you want to stand up and applause and moments you will want to cry (i did). Watch out though or the lead (humans) dodgy accent and moments of (very occasional) eye rolling dialog. The film can though stand on its own our legs though (pun intended) and you wont mind about the problems as you fall in love with the story and the world that Spielberg has portrayed so well time and time again.,War Horse
395,abundidi,A excellent story about a horse,10,9 December 2012,"I read some of the reviews, and I must say I was surprised that some people hated it. I loved it, and even shed some tears. I admit, I love a Spielberg movie. You know how it's going to end. Happy. I think that while the characters were not ""developed"" as someone critiqued,the story-line stuck to the main theme of the movie that the horse was miraculous. He plowed the field, beat a much bigger horse in a race, survived an attack of machine gun fire, helped young German deserters escape, gave comfort to a young ailing girl, pulled tanks and survived a horrendous run through barbed wire. Miraculous! I loved that the boy and his horse was reunited; I knew they would be because it was Spielberg. Like most good movies about animals, there was happy, torturous and tragic elements to this movie. Because it was Spielberg he started happy and ended happy, and I was extremely satisfied. The scene with the German and English soldiers working together to free Joey reminded me of ""All Quiet on the Western Front"" A moment where fighting stopped for humanity's reasons. True or not, it was hopeful. It was not as ""realistic"" as the video games kids play today, but it was wonderful to watch.

For all the reading I've done about the First World War, I found the battle scenes compelling, and to the best of my knowledge, painstakingly accurate. This could be one problem with the film for uninformed viewers--the nightmare of the First World War may be too hideously surreal to be taken as fact, but it was. In the Battle of the Somme, briefly portrayed in the film, the British lost over 50,000 casualties in six hours.The movie is really about the deep-reaching tragedy of the First World War, using the life of ""Joey"" as its vehicle, and despite whatever convenient plot turns the story may take, it brings us a bit closer to an horrific event in human history that we are on the verge of forgetting.",War Horse

When a saw this in theaters, I cried, I laughed, I bit my nails, I smiled, I gasped, I was inspired, and most of all, I was satisfied. This movie is so satisfying, because not everything you want to happen happens, but in the end it is a movie that leaves you in the theater, thinking, ""I WANT A HORSE!""

401,kellernail,Daring in Scope but Lacking In Substance,5,8 July 2021,"War horse is a film set during World War 1 that tells the story of a British cavalry horse and its journey throughout various battles and adventures in war torn France. Although the movie attempts, and occasionally achieves, heartfelt moments and themes of humanity in war it is severely hampered by a PG-13 rating and a rather unconvincing view of the war. Very early on in the story it becomes apparent that the movie is going to pull every punch when it comes to an accurate depiction of WW1. While it attempts to depict the horrors and atrocities of the war, much of its emotional impact is lost when the camera pans away from any and all bloodshed on several occasions. That being said, a hard R rating wouldn't necessarily fix every issue that I had with Warhorse. If the filmmakers were set on releasing a movie that appeals to a more general audience then I suppose they succeeded to some extent. The most glaring issue that I had was with movie's tone. The sappy and overwhelming earnest tone that the movie takes feels like it would belong more in a children's film rather than a Steven Spielberg directed war movie. Glimpses of the great movie that this could have been, had a more gritty and realistic approach been taken, do show through at times. Unfortunately, just as any momentum is made to this endeavor, the story redirects to relying upon painfully obvious cliches and story beats that have been used to grater effect in frankly better movies.What results from these aforementioned issues is a movie that is rather underwhelming and predictable. Some really strong performances and top notch cinematography are present, but they can't quite save the project from mediocrity. I would however tentatively recommend Warhorse to those with children who are old or mature enough to watch war movies but aren't quite ready for some of the more grisly movies of the genre. If viewed as a non threatening PG-13 family movie, Warhorse better achieves its desired effect. For anyone interested in a much more substantial movie about WW1, I'd recommend something like 1917.",War Horse

403,cheryl_lsk,One word: Disappointing,6,3 January 2012,"I went to the cinema with high hopes after seeing good reviews everywhere and a fairly high rating on IMDb coupled with the golden globe nomination. BUT after watching the show i think i'm being kind to have rated it a 6/10 out of respect for Spielberg, a few moments of beautiful horses and maybe.. just the effort taken to make this film (which makes it an even greater disappointment). I'll try my best to be as neutral as i can with regard to this film but do note my disdain.Firstly, there were just too many inconsistencies and hardly a climax in the film. I was looking for a ""Black Beauty"" or emotional undertone but i was left more confused and bored. In fact some people in the cinema laughed at certain parts of the show where laughter wasn't expected (the part where the German soldier was speaking in English to the English soldier and the English soldier remarked that he spoke great English-- that was so confusing i can't even... i mean did all the Germans speak English? then why did some in the background speak German? WHICH IS WHICH?) Another instance would be the soldiers who decide to give Albert ALL THEIR MONEY (im pretty sure i heard it correctly) to buy the horse? I'm pretty sure soldiers would not give all their money to a boy to buy just one horse (DID THEY EVEN KNOW ALBERT OR THE HORSE?) Anyway, i could go on forever but i was really just more disappointed then anything.Next, there was just NO emotional connection between the horse and the lead or anyone. Too many stories were happening at once and most had too little contact with the horse that their SUPPOSED connection just doesn't make sense. Furthermore, they just did rushed scenes between the lead and the horse that nothing concrete seemed establish anyway. The scenes they were in together were also fused with other unimportant plots (trying to till the field together to pay off the landowner as they're so poor, trying to show off to some girl who is expected to hold some significance but amount to naught etc) And to add on to that, the horse itself didn't really seem to be able to truly connect with the audience as it's more a 'miracle horse' being able to till/plough the field when not expected to and run really fast while being scared all other times. This is truly sad as the horse is a beauty but that was about it.Then, there are the multiple underlying plots that just don't seem to be fully developed. So many characters that have about ten minutes to build their story then just disappear. War seems to be of importance yet nothing concrete is really expressed through the film. Even the lead's character wasn't properly developed as he just appears in war one day out of nowhere.Lastly, being a horse lover myself, the brutality of the horses made me wince so much that my face was contorted in positions i never knew possible. Horses being tortured, trapped, falling to the ground and hitting stuff.... i couldn't stomach it. Maybe it was supposed to show the harsh reality of war horses but really, i just cross my fingers and hope no horses were harmed in the making of this show.The only pros was that i wished someone did better with the expression of this story and i really expected Spielberg to have been able to convey that. It seemed like he did nothing more than put his name on it. As a fan of his shows, this really was a great disappointment. The only parts i enjoyed were the times the horse was running on green fields but then again i would be better off watching a documentary as opposed to wasting my time on this. I am hardly harsh on films but the disappointment was too great on this one. I had deliberately left out more points that i was unhappy with just so that i would stop thinking about it and hopefully forget that i've ever watched this film and maybe have 2hrs of my life back.I know some people mentioned that this movie is more for kids, but take it from me, i like kids' movies and this is too hard to comprehend and too draggy for kids while too boring, predictable and frustrating for adults. Save your time and give Spielberg a chance by NOT watching this film. Wait for his next instead.",War Horse
404,carpesaxum,"A Legacy, Tarnished.",4,1 February 2012,"I am not usually one to review films in depth on IMDb. But having recently paid out to witness what was set to be an undoubtedly mesmerising on-screen adaptation of a truly great story, i think it only right that i voice my complaints.Firstly, where was the character development? I found myself so uninterested in the plight of any of the characters, including bizarrely, the horse itself, that i felt absolutely no emotion at what was to be the 'heart rendering' finale. It seemed as if there were scenes missing from almost every act of the film, in which the characters earned either our sympathy or empathy, because they certainly fell short of doing so.As for the cinematography, surely the Oscar nod is a joke against Spielberg and co? I hate to be a cynic, but it looked as it 90% of the film was shot around the same field. The endless use of sunrise/sunset was also incredibly tiresome.There were a few moments in the film that were almost offensive. Firstly, whoever knew the WW1 trenches to be so delightfully well kept and tidy? Not a dead body in sight. As for the 'protagonist' (who deserves the '-' based on the fact that his character is not worthy of the title).. Doesn't he respond well to treatment after being gassed?!! Dear me. If only all other soldiers were so lucky.And please, for the love of god, tell me who OK'd the scene with the boulder being sheared in half!? As far as i remember, that was the point at which i began to switch off and wonder if i had left it too long to catch the last showing of something, anything, else.I honestly wanted to enjoy this film. I really did. But what has been done to it is such a shame, I'll be sure to tell people to head to either a theatre or a bookstore if they ever want to know more about the tale.

With an unusual path it came along to the reunion of four, three men and a horse, at the end of the story. |P As the lights turn on and the cast shows, it is all too easy to tear as the director has envisioned. But one question I have to ask myself. Yes, it is a good reunion that seems to have melt the hearts of its audiences. Yet, are human held together just because the living are living and the gone are gone? As I ask my fellows in my Church the other day, what is the affinity that holds our fellowship?

""Ecstatic"". Well I have watched this movie today just because it was spielberg's & i got a strong trust for his choice of movies. The movie is Amazing. The way he portrayed the affection between albert & joey is impeccable. The movie starts just like any other animal oriented movie but will keep u glued & involved into the story as it progresses.One touching movie from him after A.I. Watch it if u got love for animals cos u will be overwhelmed & watch it if u don't love animals cos U will start loving 'em. I would say one hell of a movie worth watching.

412,trholbrook57,Great Story of the Power of the Heart and Soul of Man and Horse Joined Together Against Incredible Odds,9,13 December 2011,"""War Horse"" is one of those rare movie gems that take you on an emotional roller-coaster ride bringing you out on top for the most part. It shows just how mean and cruel this world can be and the power the human heart and soul have, especially joined collectively with that of others along with the strength of great animal, to overcome the bad and accomplish phenomenally good things. The cinematography is great, the music score wonderful, and the story incredible. This movie is a major hit with my teenagers. An integral part of the story is the horror of battlefield conflict and the loss and tragedy of war. As a parent, I must caution that the World War I battle scenes are graphically realistic but without too much gore. It isn't a family film for this reason. As long as you can handle the intense WWI battle scene realism, I highly recommend ""War Horse"" as a well done, quality movie very much worth seeing.",War Horse

This movie is passionate, poignant, intense and engaging. Unlike so many war movies, the violence does not alienate the audience, but there IS violence, so don't take children under 10 years of age. War and what it does to anyone or anything damaged by it is a profound subject. ""War Horse"" tells it well. This movie stayed with me long after I left the theater and it was hard to stop thinking about it.

This isn't another childish ""horsemovie"" for young girls who loves horses, this is art.Of course, this is a really great movie for those who loves horses too, but I don't think you have to love horses to watch this.It's been a pleasure watching this movie, and I will hopefully watch it again in the future.

416,hmlegendlife,War Horse is Good But Not Without Flaws,7,16 November 2011,"I was lucky to see an advanced screening of Steven Spielberg's War Horse last night, a film I was very hyped for. I must say I did not leave disappointed, but it still could have been better.The film was good. It was more exceptional than your average film released these days. The first part of the film was slow though, without anything major happening except one standout scene that involved the protagonist and his horse bonding with plowing. Besides one scene though, the bond between the protagonist and his horse isn't very convincing as to why he would love the horse so much.Once the horse is enlisted in the army (not a spoiler as it is shown in the preview), the film picks up a bit, though the film could have used a great battle sequence, we were given a mediocre one.The last third of the movie saved the film. The last third was emotional and features an almost-incredible action sequence. Let's just say it was exceptional filmmaking in the battle, but no Saving Private Ryan.Spielberg's direction with the script was great. The acting was positive in every role, though no single member was Oscar-worthy. The cinematography IS Oscar-Worthy, it was really beautiful. John Williams' score was a bit of a disappointment as it was good, but suffered from too much of a recurring theme which will probably eliminate him as an Oscar nominee such as Alan Silvestri's score for Cast Away and James Horner's score for The Perfect Storm.Overall, the movie is good and surprisingly a family film. The battle sequences were not graphic at all, nor were they really that violent. The movie was not tearful or that sad. It WAS NOT a tearjerker, which disappointed me. But, go see it and judge for yourself, because the film was good, and maybe you'll find it to be great.",War Horse
417,Mcfly42,Snore Horse,5,22 January 2012,"First, a 5 is generous. The horses were the best actors, seriously. Cant believe Spielberg put his name on this ""wish I was good enough to be a Hallmark after school special"". Germans with British accents, over the top Hollywood dumb down, and actors as flat as this iPad. One scene, when our brave lad hero knucklehead chucks a grenade into a machine gun nest then runs into the trenches finds the entire trench system devoid of the enemy, except dead (formerly heavily British dialected English speaking) Germans. Everyone's dead. From what? His one hand grenade? Perfect example of one of the many untied loose ends in the screenplay. Thank god it was only 4 hours long...seemed like. This flick is MS3K worthy right now. Funny, the wife and I kept expecting a Monty Python skit to break out every 15 minutes due to the sheer campiness of the acting and over eager story line. How is this junker NOT out on DVD already. Save your money unless you have zero expectations in film making.",War Horse

It takes an age to get going, such as it does...It's neither one thing or another, it's not a war film, it's not a love story and it's not an animal ""road movie"", it seems to fall somewhere in the middle for me. The biggest problem I had with it was the predictability of it all, it's very formulaic and there were no surprises whatsoever for me...plus, with the odd exception, it is just sooooo slushy all of the way through - I thought I was going to have to reach for my sick bag at points.It lacks any real punch at all in my opinion - possibly due to the 12A rating and wanting to attract a younger audience. It's a bit like Black Beauty in places (particularly for about the first hour!) and you can almost imagine the theme tune playing in the background.My wife loved it funnily enough but I found it incredibly dull. Could have been so much better!",War Horse
419,NeonVoiceBox,"Parent: Worth seeing, memorable, but misses the mark.",7,15 January 2012,"We (myself and daughter) were'nt sure what to think of this. It missed something but it is difficult to say what. We are however glad we saw it. Given the story line there was'nt a lot of room for character development so it was difficult to empathise too much with the main characters (not talking about the horse). Those who are animal lovers and more likely to invest the horse with human characteristics might get more from this. The horse is no lassie and it felt difficult (apart from one or two scenes) to get too involved in the horse's plight. On the plus side (this is a children's film) I think the younger audience will get a lot from this. As a parent, the film showed the human side of characters on both sides of the conflict. The action scenes were exceptionally well done in that it showed how awful and futile war can be (children do need to know this!) without the need for scenes from the abattoir. From an education point of view it was thought provoking and served to generate some discussion.",War Horse
420,strayxxdog,Sequel of Black Beauty...?,8,30 December 2011,"One of the most touching and amazing horse movies is Black Beauty. However, I found War Horse parallel to that movie.. So, it starts off with this horse and a guy and then they obviously start bonding. After, they are too poor to take care of the horse so they sell it and the horse goes through a lot, meeting new people. And of course, the main horse, Joey, has a friend which later on dies. Then somehow, the horse will return to its original owner. EXACT same plot as Black Beauty. Some of the parts were really pathetic but for those horse lovers and people that really love these animal movies, you will definitely enjoy it. Although none of the scenes will not make you cry or anything, it is still heartwarming. I have to say, this movie was very predictable. The first moment Joey got carried away, I whispered to my friend next to me ""Joey is going to end up with the boy again."" If you are expecting good actions then I do not recommend it. Just watch it for the ""horse"" stuff. I personally enjoyed it because I am a horse-lover myself. I would recommend it to some people but not all.",War Horse

The cinematography is excellent, the presentation of the the lead actors (the horses!) is done very well and the overall story is heart wrenching but beautiful. This is a movie you will probably have to watch twice, mainly because you will not see it clearly the first time due to your tears. It is not really a sad movie as such, but just grabs your emotion and tosses it around like a rag doll. The storyline is essentially simple but beautiful, and the way it has been presented is almost flawless. I say almost because some of the developments in the story could probably only have happened due to extreme occurrences of serendipity. It is a movie that has to be seen, and is best seen on a big screen with excellent sound for the best effect.",War Horse

Those men will leave VERY disappointed, this is no war movie. This is a female oriented sentimental movie about a horse and his various owners. Lovely cinematography reminiscent of Gone with the Wind at times. Plot drags and drags after the halfway point. First time in awhile I have almost fallen asleep during a film. Many young children became restless in the theater when the horse was not on screen or the war scenery/action was in progress. Do not take children nor husband/boyfriend to this, do take gal pays though as I'm sure a gaggle of women or women and their effeminate male friends would enjoy this.",War Horse
423,enemyofsanity,A Complete Waste of Time,1,7 January 2012,"This was possibly one of the worst films I've ever seen. I was taken to see it, so it wasn't my choice of movie. I thought it might be a painless hour or so and then it would be over, but it turned out to be much worse. If I could have walked out on it, I would have after the first 10 minutes.Seriously, how has this film scored such high reviews? I was eagerly waiting for the boy to find Joey again, not because I felt anything for the characters or the film itself, but simply so it would finally be over and I could get up, walk out, and forget I ever wasted my time on such a terrible piece of cinema. You know it's going to happen in the end, they'll be reunited and it will be a happily ever after ending, and I absolutely hate films with the end apparent from the start. For once can Hollywood actually make a realistic film? Not only did you know what was going to happen, it was dragged out towards the end in the most infuriating manner. Though perhaps that was just because I was so fed up with the rest of the movie and wanted nothing more than to leave.And what is their problem with subtitles? If you're going to have Germans in your film, and they're shouting in German in the background, put some effort in and actually make them SPEAK German. I'm absolutely sick of characters speaking in English, simply because an audience is obviously too dumb to be able to read a couple of lines of subtitles. The fact that actual languages are not used completely ruins any aspect of realism (not that this movie had a shred of it). Not to mention the atrocious German accents the actors feigned. This is one of the main reasons I hardly watch mainstream films anymore.I love a good war film, a gritty realistic war film with none of the usual clichés and no sappy romance thrown in for no apparent reason, just so the audience can feel good about something. There's not much to feel good about in war. But this was almost sickening. I was disgusted by the way the life of -one- solitary horse was played up, when millions and millions of people died in WW1. I was left with a sour taste afterwards.I don't usually write reviews, but I had to for this one. I feel like I have to stop people from wasting their time on this piece of crap. I want that two hours of my life back.",War Horse
424,juggertime,Horses Don't Understand English!,4,12 January 2012,"I didn't want to see this film... I didn't understand the hype that a horse movie was getting in the theatre either. It's a movie about a horse... a War Horse... But I watched it, and I'm reviewing it - and I'm sure that I'm going to make a few people mad when they read it - well so be it! There was one question in my mind that kept popping into my head while watching this, ""Do we like this film because it's a good film, or do we like it because it's a Spielberg film?"" That's the question that keeps circling in my mind when I see such rave reviews about this film. Here we have a movie about a horse that everybody thinks is special, who survives the war, and touches many lives in his adventures. Is this a story that is so groundbreaking? In my opinion, no. We've seen this before with other animal films and just because Spielberg directed it doesn't make it awesome.I will say that the story was pretty unique in places, and it showcased the first World War; which doesn't get a lot of play in film. But there are a lot of predictable elements in this picture that get a little tiresome as the film dredges on for two and a half hours! Quite frankly, it was just plain cheesy! And although I know there is an audience for that kind of movie making, I can't help but wonder why other great films get torn apart while this one gets praised when it's mediocre at best. And I'm going to come out and say that I hate it when films pretend like animals can understand English; HORSES DON'T SPEAK English! The fact that they try and push on us that this horse is so special is kind of insulting to story telling because it's too unbelievable. And I like unbelievable films normally - just not films that take it to this level; where EVERY person is smitten with this stupid horse... Maybe I'm missing something here...I could see younger and older audiences liking this film. My parents would probably love it; they're in their sixties... It's very reminiscent of the older films from the 1950's I found. Where the drama keeps coming, but you never feel like the horse is in any real danger. Or that everything is going to turn out fine in the end, where people just become saints at every turn. It's a nice thought, and perhaps I'm a little jaded in this modern age, but I found it a little placid for most of the film. I just can't help but expect MORE from the films that are coming out of Hollywood and getting reviews like this. And that goes for Spielberg too! The man has made so many classics, I can't help but think that this was not one of his stronger films. Perhaps people are enjoying it because it is such an uplifting film... I still can't help but expect more.I will say that the film is beautiful looking! Great lighting and backdrops. There are scenes that take place on the battlefield of WWI that have such an ambiance to them. It's dreary and scary - and really puts what the soldiers must have seen while fighting into perspective. The shots of the countryside were really nice too, great wide shots that shows off the beauty of the land. The cinematography was definitely a high point in this film where the acting and the story fell short - the look of the film certainly picked up the slack. I would venture to say that more films should take a lesson from this film from its overall visuals. Special effects and CGI are awesome - but having a base level of beauty for the backdrop of the film can really push the overall experience forward for the viewer. Well done War Horse! Overall I'm going to say that I didn't really like this movie. I was bored and frustrated that I had to wait so long for it to end. And I'm sure that there are people out there who love these fluffy films (Obviously, look at the ratings it's getting) - I don't. I just want a little more sustenance to my movies. I want movies that push the envelope just a little bit further. I want a movie that doesn't ride solely on the director instead of its own calibre. And I think one of the reasons that I'm disliking this movie as much as I am is because of the hype it's getting for something that is mediocre at best. It's NOT a great film, stop sucking up to Spielberg... And the problem is that I want to give it a higher score because I know that I'm going to irritate people, I want to give it a higher score because it IS uplifting while so much brings us down - but I can't, I just can't. I just didn't find this film to be THAT good. It could have been better, it should have been better - but it wasn't. And unless you're a horse/animal film lover - I really don't think this film is going to be attractive to you. So with all that being said (And I'm wearing a helmet for when people start throwing rocks at me) - I'm giving War Horse a 4 out of 10.",War Horse

One of my most favorite movie now. I can compare it to Titanic. I cried several times watching this. It is filled with passion, thrill, suspense and of course drama. You should definitively see this. Its not just about a horse in the war, it is about the human nature and how when we love something the god can work it out for us fortunately. Its about the simple nature of us that how we easily fall in love and start caring for somebody. It is not always a love story between a boy and girl and the god old proved portion of cinema. This movie proves it that any story with honest emotions and intention can win hearts. I think that there are not that much World War 1 movies and TV shows as there for the World War 2. May be because there was not that much technological advances in 1916 and it is very hard to amaze us today with that time ""slow"" stories. But this one is not about the guns and the bombs, it is simple act about a horse and its owner and how they get through the war for their ultimate destiny.",War Horse

I laughed, I cried and at the end I applauded. This is what movies are supposed to be like. It entertains, end of story. Too many people today like to pick apart the technical side of movies and therefore miss getting into the emotion of the film.

That's what I admire most about this film adaptation of an impossible play. Nothing is impossible in the kingdom of Steven Spielberg. Phenomenal action, appropriate humanity & sets that transport the viewer right to the scene. Warhorse may be too much for some children under 13. Especially young girls who are still in their ""horsey phase"" of adolescence. Make sure there are plenty of tissues around if you're a parent or guardian watching with youngsters.

While there are some obvious faults in it, I was pleasantly surprised. The fact that the plot moves along almost as a series of episodes had been criticised in one of these reviews but I thought it both made sense and allowed the film to keep moving at a reasonably quick pace. I felt that you did feel for the different people the horse comes into contact with as it moves from field, to farm, to army training and then through various different areas of the war. We are shown how many different groups of people can be effected and the different ways they suffer in, without seeing too much blood and guts.

After watching this movie i thought it was a wonderful adaption of how animals and human connect with each other. It connected different stories of different people with the same aim of friendship.

I have actively sought out bad movies previously in order to see just how bad they are, but this one is worse. By the end of the film my eyes were bleeding from sitting through the whole thing. The film's only redeeming feature was that it ended, but it sure took its sweet time about that. It is so bad that I wouldn't recommend it even to someone who likes to watch bad films, I think they would gain more enjoyment from being coiled up in barbed wire.There are no characters to identify with, the cinematography is appalling, the sets look very fake and the colours are over-dramatic, the musical score attempts to be emotionally manipulative and fails. One couple left the theatre half way through. I had faith it might get better so stuck it out, but I shouldn't have.There was a point where I was torn between excitement that the pain of watching the film would end if the horse died, and a genuine concern for the horse's wellbeing during the filming. Later I reassured myself with the knowledge that animal rights protesters would never allow the horse to endure the pain of watching this film.I can't believe this film currently scores 7.2 on IMDb, this has driven me to review it and hopefully drag it's score down to less than 2, where it belongs, as I felt like someone was jabbing needles into my eyes throughout the film.",War Horse

When making a multi-million dollar movie can't they afford some REAL local extras who speak with a proper Devon accent? (b) Why were there lots of conifer plantations on Dartmoor in a film set before/during WW1? These only started to be planted well after WW1. (c) Why was the Devon village made of Cotswold stone? There were plenty of Dartmoor villages that would have made perfect sets. (d) Why do we have to have what my wife and I call ""American deep"" music to portray pathos? It just doesn't add anything.

I wasn't drunk enough to make it past the horse training lessons that showed a painfully unbelievable boy-man whispering sweetly pleaful sentences into a pretty horse's ears. That unnecessary tripe was an insult to the bond that happens between a person and an animal when they work to make a few commands understood between them, and eventually communicate through a whole range of body and tone languages.Once the credibility of the film was so completely trashed in those early scenes, there was no point in watching any further.When movies like this get Oscar nominations, it turns the Academy Awards into a meaningless Hollywood cronies parade.",War Horse

437,Hammer2Fall,"Pleasing, warming tale of personal strength in the face of a nightmare setting.",8,5 December 2011,"If you're walking into War Horse expecting something the likes of Saving Private Ryan, viewer beware. This is a very different kind of war film, bloodless yet not without plentiful casualties, and sweeping while very intimate, ignoring the larger workings of The Great War and focusing entirely on Joey the horse and the lives he touches from one end of the war to the other. Joey is firmly the star - the movie's best scene features him racing wildly across the trenches in the midst of a bombastic firefight - and its his lively personality and interactions with the human costars that make the movie.The film begins with Joey's birth, where he immediately catches the eye of Albert (a sometimes disturbingly bright-eyed Jeremy Irvine). Through what's at first a drunken mistake by his father, Albert comes to own Joey, and the film's first act develops their friendship on the uphill road to teaching Joey how to pull a plow. Without the success of that relationship, the rest of the movie might fall flat on its face, but succeed it does, thanks largely to restrained attempts on Spielberg's part to try and make the horse more human. Never once does the film use the ""horse laugh"" to garner a cheap chuckle, for example; War Horse offers plenty of genuinely clever, funny moments without having to stoop to such clichés.Once Joey is sold to the British army in a desperate act to save Albert's family farm, the remainder of the film becomes a more episodic affair as Joey passes from one surrogate owner to another. Relying on earnest performance rather than name recognition (the two biggest name actors in the cast are Emily Watson and David Thewlis, and their parts are relatively brief), the spotlight shines on a number of faces recognizable depending upon your pop culture preferences; Tom Hiddleston of Thor fame, Benedict Cumberbatch of BBC's Sherlock, Eddie Marsan of Guy Ritchie's Sherlock Holmes, and even ""Hey, it's that one guy!"" actor and Ridley Scott look-alike Liam Cunningham. The standout of the bunch, the best human performance aside from Jeremy Irvine, is Niels Arestrup as a French farmer, whose young granddaughter happens upon Joey after a twist of fate lands him in their windmill.As a war film, War Horse prevails in its grayscale depiction of WWI. By telling the story through the eyes of an innocent animal and thus a casual observer, the film avoids painting the British and German armies in stark black and white, instead introducing us to the good guys on both sides of the conflict, culminating in an amusing encounter between a British soldier (RocknRolla's Toby Kebbell) and a German enlisted man attempting to free Joey from the mess of barbed wire in which he's become ensnared.While the film is a chaste PG-13, its hardly a clean war. Through creative editing that makes for some of the film's most haunting moments, Spielberg often shows the battle without showing the battle. Picture for a moment: a battalion on horseback charging toward an enemy encampment - followed immediately by the riderless horses racing past the enemy's line of machine guns. You never see a bullet hit or a spray of red, but with the power of your mind filling in the blanks, you never need to.War Horse stumbles only a few times, once regarding the pacing. Don't get me wrong, at 2 hours and 20 minutes, it's a breeze to sit through, but therein lies some of the problem. The film goes from the beginning of the war through the end, yet there's never any real sense that so much time has passed. I grant, however, that time by an animal's perception differs from a human's, so in this Joey's whirlwind tale is believable. Call it a nitpick.A mild SPOILER WARNING in this section: The other failing of the movie is a sequence toward the end in which a character from Joey's past returns, attempting something with motivations noble enough in his own eyes, but driven by an event only described in dialogue. The scene comes off as an errant attempt to tug the heartstrings one too many times without proper setup to do so, and the conclusion of the sequence borders on eye-rollingly predictable.On a technical level, War Horse is everything you've come to expect from Spielberg, even gaining forgiveness for the few seconds in which a CGI stunt-horse appears - the shots are brief and so well-composed that you forget it was there the moment the real horse seamlessly resurfaces. And what would a Spielberg movie be without the contributions of his hetero life-mate John Williams, offering yet another grand aural backdrop to the expert visuals? In storytelling, War Horse overcomes the threat of succumbing to sap and weaves a pleasing, warming tale of personal strength in the face of a nightmare setting. To the casual film-goer, it'll likely come off as schmaltz. But those that know better, know it's Spielberg schmaltz. And that's why it works.",War Horse

Lets take a look at a few of the absurdities:The horse is bought by a farmer who ""knowingly"" will not be able to pay the rent on his farm because of it. Then when the horse will not take the yoke he is about to shoot it... rather than sell it to pay his rent!The horse is trained by his son who chooses to plough uphill through rocks rather than remove them. Then the neighbours come over to ""watch"" rather than help remove them. The horse pulls right through a bolder, strong horse strong plough?Off to war where the cavalry do a surprise charge through a German camp, only to end up facing German machine gun fire set up on the edge of the forest pointing into their own camp?To a girl's farm where they manage to hide two horses in the upper bedroom with soldiers ransacking the place, and they don't make a sound... The old man gives her a saddle and she can instantly ride like a pro, but rides over a hill and across a river into the German army, which nobody heard coming!All I can say is wow, this really is a classic, critics' choice, full of horse stuff.",War Horse

While his ability to direct battles is top notch, it is his fascination with it that disturbs me. Perhaps if he had worn a uniform he'd realize there's nothing entertaining or glamorous about young men and women being killed in battle. And graphic depictions of people and animals suffering is not what I'd call an enjoyable day at the movies. If you're planning on seeing War Horse, save your money.

443,talentedjen,Sapfest with some good war scenes - wait for DVD,4,30 January 2012,"Warning: This is all spoilers. I went into this knowing it would be sappy, but the sap far exceeded my expectations. Where to start? 1. The young guy in the movie gushed so much over his horse that I expected him to marry it at the end. The disturbing war scenes were actually a relief after sitting through the ""We can do it, Joey! You're the best horse in the world!"" scenes at the beginning. 2. The people in Devon have nothing better to do than watch a kid plow a field? Also, it was pretty lucky for them that it rained right then (within minutes the rocky ground was soft, so plowing became a cinch). Conversely, rain is bad after you've planted your crops. 3. We follow Joey the horse through his World War I experiences, during which he changes hands several times. For some reason, the Germans and French (and possibly other nationalities?) speak perfect English at all times with little or no trace of an accent, so about mid-way through the movie I lost track of which army was abusing the horse. 4. Joey winds up getting injured in a ""no mans land,"" and a British doctor determines that the horse has tetanus and should be put down, as nothing can be done for him. Then Joey's owner turns up, identifies the horse as Joey, and tells the doctor that he loves Joey. Obviously, a medical professional's diagnosis is BS if there's somebody around who loves the patient and doesn't want him to die, as evident by the fact that Joey turns out just fine. Despite this (and many other) problems, the war scenes were done very well, the movie sheds light on the contribution and abuse of horses during WWI, and it has renewed interest in the welfare of horses today, so the movie itself wasn't a total waste of everybody's time.",War Horse

I have ridden a horse, fed a horse a carrot, and even brushed one horse's lovely hair; nevertheless amongst all these adventurous activities horses do not amuse me. Whatever the reason may be towards my dislike of this pony population, does not mean I can't enjoy a good horse movie. Unfortunately, War Horse is the exact opposite of such. I could rant and rave and pick apart every aspect of this movie that I disliked, but in the end that would only cause me to relive every torturous second. Instead I will keep it brief analyzing the first 5 laughable minutes. What makes War Horse such an unbelievingly bad movie is quite simple; it lacks any emotional depth. Within the first few beats, we the audience see a horse (Joey) and his mom (I don't know her name) hanging out in a field of grass. What's more exciting then that! Albert (Jeremy Irvine) who is watching this horsey display sure thinks so, especially when he tries to feed Joey an apple. With sickly sweet music overlaying Albert's delighted face as Joey refuses to take the treat, we the audience are supposed to feel a deep connection between this heartwarming? couple. The only problem is what in the hell makes it heartwarming?!. Compare War Horse to Seabiscuit or well, any story. Tobey Magquire does not immediately fall in love with his horsey companion. Why? There's no reason too! Seabiscut's a pain in the ass which consequently makes it a great movie because of its great reversal. A jockey and his horse once enemies become friends winning races and ultimately life. With war horse there is NO REVERVSAL. Albert immediately loves Joey with absolutely no reason as to...why.? What has Joey proved within that first 2 minutes that deserves music emulating an emotional Albert and therefore an emotional audience. Coincidently the rest of the movie follows the same pattern: manipulation through warm-felt music replacing any acceptable storyline as to why I am crying. Where's the Kleenex?",War Horse

I have great respect for the master filmmaker and expected a lot more. The movie has all the angles for a great classic but lacks the passion to enthrall the audience. I was entertained but not awed as most of his films do. A very technically sound film but a rather predictable and sentimental story. Great performance by the horse outshines others around should be in the best actor nominations. Loved the WWI scenes.

Enthusiastic son who bonds with the horse, has a rivalry with the land-owner's son over a girl (which is never further developed); 4. The evil land-owner, who has a rivalry with the alcholic war-hero father (over his ""plain"" wife?); 5.

Tommy and Jerry meet in no-mans-land and discover they are all just men fighting against their will; 8.

Germans haul up their howitzers to the top of a hill (distance of 50m) to shell the front lines (and present clear targets for counter battery fire); 3. English soldiers decide to dispense with all lessons gained over four years of warfare and have a good old fashioned slow walk to the machine gun equipped enemy (without assistance of a rolling barrage or gas masks).And the largest problem, everybody loves this ""miracle""-horse (this is an actual line from the film) despite the horse doing nothing special: 1. the horse is bought for 30 guineas and fails to save the farm, fails to jump a hedgerow (manages to plough a field, hurrah); 2. is bought by a cavalry officer who promptly gets shot; 3. switches allegiance, helps a German conscript save his brother and ends up getting them both shot; 4. befriends a black horse, which dies in a ditch; 5. befriends a french girl, who dies from a non-descript sickness; 6. runs into some barbed wire and has to be saved; 7. fails to save its owner who gets gassed and evacuated.All in all a good movie for horse lovers or small children who need a cliché introduction to the horrors of world war one (minus blood).For all others stay away and rent all quiet on the western front instead...",War Horse

There were many parts which i felt were anti-climatic and some scenes were over-exaggerated and dragged on. Many of the human characters were only glossed over as well and I feel they should've spent more time on them to accentuate the horse's experience.However, some parts of the movie were quite moving and it was amazing how well they have trained the horses to act.

I was expecting Spielberg at his best...I saw mediocre scripting, a disjointed plot, weak acting (except from Thewlis, Joey the horse, Celine Buckens, and Niels Arestrup).This movie was a series of many vignettes separated by time and geography. Totally unbelievable. Emily had Joey maybe two days and are we to believe the horse was her whole life as the grandfather said. The horse was encumbered by hundreds of strips of barbed and concertina wire and a dozen barricade poles in No Man's Land. When he was cut out but the Brit and German solider it was a few snip and move one pole...all done... he could walk.Because of its cinematography its a movie to watch twice (and only twice), the second time with displayed dialog on so you can understand what was said in all those accents amid the noise of war.",War Horse

The movie has lots of spectacular shots which make the examples for movie making classes as other works by Spielberg but I believe the story doesn't make space for a long feature film. It might be very entertaining for who interested in pet world but not majority such as Spielberg previous work. Using the known actors and actress could help to make the movie more attractive. However, this is the way usually Spielberg choose to get best performance from any actor. Lack of the having a dramatic point or considerable conflict in the story is one the week point of movie so that every things go on as expected and usually do not get worried about the main character (horse) that much. The rhythm of the action is almost the same on whole the time and it increase the boringness of the film.",War Horse
452,blackmarketkaty,Dreadful Dreck,1,28 November 2011,"Did I watch the same film that the other reviewers here watched? Because I found nothing but obvious Oscar bait. It was as if someone wrote a list of every possible tear-jerking story cliché and checked off as many as they could fit within time and budget constraints. Horses? Check! War? Check! Plucky youngsters? Check and check! Plucky youngsters fighting to save the farm! Plucky youngsters fighting to keep the horse! Plucky youngsters who were previously enemies now getting along! Plucky youngsters severely wounded but staying plucky! I could go on. Really, I could. But all that's necessary to say is that almost everything you expect to happen does.The cast is full of fantastic actors whose talent is disappointingly wasted in this film. I can't blame them, considering the schmaltzy script they had to work with (""It's a miracle horse!"" - somebody actually says that. Actually, I think every character says that?). Emily Watson's brow furrows expertly. David Thewlis sneers as required. Peter Mullan stares remorsefully with perfection. Benedict Cumberbatch's mustache should win its own Oscar, and if an Oscar could be won simply for tearful lip quivering, Jeremy Irvine would win it for sure. I only wish I could have taken any of it seriously. Actually, I found myself caring more about the father's pennant than the horse.Never have I seen such a display of dull writing, ham-fisted scripting, utterly scattered direction and overkill cinematography. It's no surprise they've evaded professional critics in screenings. I don't know who they've targeted everywhere else, but the audience at mine was largely seniors and veterans who all applauded it wildly. The younger audience members I saw did not seem to be so impressed. Some in my row were actually laughing quietly at all the wrong places.

453,ronmurp,"Black Beauty meets Gone with the Wind, and some action.",3,19 January 2012,"I suppose the good bits do justice to the title. It really got going with the introduction of Tom Hiddleston's and Benedict Cumberbatch's characters, portraying the naïveté of cavalry warfare in the face of the mechanisation of war.Before that it was essentially Black Beauty, or one of many other sentimentalist horse films. There was a break in the war, which allowed for more Black Beauty moments, and some pretty poor acting, as a young, innocent and physically fragile Emille overcomes protestations from her grandfather to avoid the dangers of riding - for a brief moment (she rode considerably well given her non-riding brittle boned life so far). But we are soon back into the reality of war as the Germans are waiting for her over the hill.We'll set aside how the horse, Joey (a name I thought more suitable to a budgie), was lucky enough to come across horse lovers so often, because without that convenience there would be no survival for Joey on the cards anyway.The trench scenes were reasonable enough, but given Spielberg's history we'd expect that. An opportunity of a light moment and some comedy occurs as the Brit and the Hun co-operate to free the horse from no mans land. But soon the grit of warfare is over, along with the war, and our human and equestrian heroes are reunited with a whistle and a failed dramatic parting of the crowd. The final auction was a total contrivance in the first place as an obvious and failed echo of Joey's beginnings; and the old dude's appearance, utter commitment to buying the horse, only to give him up so poorly, was a complete sham as a story and as a spectacle of acting. Apparently he'd travelled three days to buy this horse. That's odd. How did he know that this particular horse was being sold, or was even alive. Complete and utter contrived tripe.Finally, the Gone With the Wind sunsets were outrageous. You don't need to be a weatherman to spot some pretty standard cloudy British weather with a red filter on the lens, or post-production processing.

I feel that Steven Spielberg has borrowed more scenes from John ford than Milton Berle stole jokes. Many film goers leaving the theater spoke of Gone With the Wind and for myself ""The Searchers and ""How Green is my Valley""for comparitive scenes such as ANY scene at the gates of the farm involving characters coming and going out of scene,watch and take notice. As for the waste of the fine ensemble cast that is in the film, leave that to the writers and Mr. Spielberg who seem to treat these characters like disjointed marionettes. Don't get me wrong its not a bad film..just could have been Great if some thought was put to it. Showing the ravages of war without blood is silly at best. The Cavalry charge into the machine gun batteries with CGI riderless horses as the sign of devastation was mindblowing as these weapons would have wasted everything in their withering fire. Showing bodies flying through the air after a shell hits a trench was the closest thing to carnage from the bloodiest war in history. I know Mr. Spielberg has issues with this but be real..""Saving Prvt. Ryan"" was a master piece,cmon what happened! ""Black Beauty"" seems to keep popping into my mind in comparison to this film..yet with the War angle...what could have been great is just another formulaic Hollywood box office presentation from a director who has lost his edge!

461,rjfairman-writer,Poor Horse,6,1 February 2012,"After watching the moody, dynamic, explosive trailer for this film, I was expecting rather more than a big-budget, over-sentimental re- imagining of the Black Beauty franchise. I think if I'd been expecting a child-friendly, family film - which War Horse certainly is - I may have enjoyed it more. I knew I was in trouble during the early scenes of War Horse, observing that First World War Devonshire was shot in an unnervingly similar way to the idyllic Hobbiton scenes from Lord of the Rings.Another deception came with the cast. With such heavy-weight acting prowess at its disposal (the likes of Emily Watson, Tom Hiddleston, Benedict Cumberbatch and Eddie Marsan) one might expect some emotional depth and gritty dialogue to enjoy. There isn't any. Instead, we see our beloved thespians in banal scenes that serve as little more than extended cameos. To illustrate my point, there's a goose in the film - albeit a brilliant goose - who is given more of an opportunity to develop an on-screen presence.Filled with saccharine poignancy and tenderness, War Horse is bereft of the proper narrative structure and exposition to support such contrived, tear-jerking set pieces. That's the downfall of 'multi-story' films. And so, the audience is merely buffeted from one mawkish scene to another.There are several positives though and I don't wish to be too uncharitable. Firstly; because of the terrifically strong cast, the acting is sound. Even reactions that seem completely unrealistic can be forgiven because they are portrayed so well. Secondly; the 'horse acting' is amazing and often the most emotionally stirring. Thirdly and finally: it's Spielberg. There's a craft to his movies that imbues them with an inimitable, delightful quality and even though this movie has several flaws, his 'sheen' goes a long way to making up for them.",War Horse
462,auduskfm,"Good for animal lovers, I guess.",4,3 January 2012,"Note: if you want to hear anything good about this movie, skip to the last paragraph. I hate movies about animals. Usually. However, I had high hopes for War Horse, purely on the basis of the good things I had heard about it. But this movie disappointed me. Most (not all) of the scenes were covered in cheese. I found myself trying to keep from laughing out loud at scenes that were supposed to be moving. And every time somebody said the words 'miracle horse,' I did a face-palm. I also predicted the entire movie after watching the trailer for the first time. I thought that Spielberg might surprise me and make an original movie, but I was wrong. Also, people acted so weird towards that horse. I understand it's the miracle horse, and it's beautiful and all, but people just cut it so much slack the entire movie. Hundreds of thousands of horses died in WWI; but this horse, it was just too beautiful to die. At least, that was the mindset of nearly every person who came across it. Except for that one German officer. He wasn't very nice. Everybody else, though, treated it like the equine Messiah. It all was just too unbelievable. And how Albert found his beloved horse? Somebody mentioned a 'miracle horse' and he lit up like a Christmas tree. 'My old horse has been at war for four years, but no matter; this must be him.' And then he parted the crowd and whistled for his Joey (which I predicted, as well, right down to how the soldiers slowly backed up, showing the blinded Albert with his hands to his mouth). The genius horse didn't even come to him, but still- he knew. Amongst millions of horses it could be, he knew it was his. Queue tears. There were about three characters that I genuinely liked in this movie: Gunther- the young German soldier who ran off with the horses and his brother; Captain Nicholls- the guy who originally bought Joey from the Narracotts; and the big, black horse- Joey's friend/lover. Don't ask me why. All of the other characters were A) obnoxious, B) not in enough of the movie, C) way too creepy-obsessed with that 'miracle' horse, or D) a combination of the above. Still, I know I just gave this film a lot of crap, but it wasn't all bad. The scenes of war were great, and it gave me a new respect for all of the losses during WWI, on all sides. My favorite was probably the English storming of the unsuspecting German camp, and subsequent loss. Also, when the two AWOL German soldiers were killed. (If you haven't noticed, both scenes involve the deaths of two of my three favorite characters. I must be a masochist). The scenery was beautiful, like all Spielberg films, if not a little over-the-top (referring to the last scene when Albert comes home to his family. That sunset was unreal, and not in a good way). Pretty much the whole war aspect was good, and it reminded me that a lot of soldiers on the enemy side are still innocent young men. That was probably what moved me the most. But, ugh, the rest of the movie? Not my favorite. I can see why some people like it, though. If you get past all of the cheese, and you genuinely like the characters and the miracle horse, it would be a nice story. But I was right when I thought that animal movies are not for me.",War Horse

It is the textbook definition of an instant classic.For a film as miraculous as this, a mere Academy Award is not nearly enough to acknowledge the visionaries who conceived it.It's rare for a film like this to come along, so please take my word when I tell you that you need to experience this beautiful story.And let us all hope that Spielberg continues his endless string of imaginative and inspirational films, which is what makes him the best.Have fun at the movie!",War Horse
464,waitingfortheworms00,If Disney made a war movie.,2,26 December 2011,"Just returned from the theater from seeing the bomb. I have given it a 2 just for the WW1 content, which was what drew me to see the movie. The great Mr Spielberg should be ashamed for putting out this tripe. What was the demographic he was trying to reach? Ten year-old girls who love ponies? War movie aficionados? The two don't mix. The set-up is laborious. There were broad swaths of the storyline that took way to long for what they added to the movie. The war scenes were sanitized for the 10 year-old pony lovers in the audience. This movie reminded me of Cowboys and Aliens. Trying to incorporate two opposing genres and ending up failing at both miserably. SAVE YOUR MONEY !!!",War Horse
465,pagan-hare,Why Did He Bother?,2,24 January 2012,"I have always been an admirer of Steven Spielberg's but frankly I am wondering why he bothered making this film! My sister asked me to go with her last Friday to see this film, so I quickly finished the book so as not to spoil the end of it. Shouldn't have bothered as the film bore little or no resemblance to the book! Right from the start I was sat open mouthed at how Albert first meets Joey (the horse)...Then the missing Zoey! Then how 'nice' Albert's Dad was! And how Albert joined the war really blew my mind. In the book he joined the veterinary corp (as he knew he had a better chance of finding Joey...logical) and in the film he's a solider in the trenches!! (not so logical).I could go on how awful this was but it's too depressing to be honest! The film is also way too long. The book, as it was, would have made a film about 1hour 30 - 40 minutes long! This rubbish was over 2 hours long!!!My opinion of author Michael Morpurgo has gone down the plughole frankly because he gave this film his royal seal of approval...shame on you Mr Spielberg and shame on you Mr Morpurgo for allowing this travesty! You need to take a few leaves out of J. K. Rowlings book!!!I will not be recommending this film to family or friends!!!",War Horse
466,NickSauschuckMovieGuy11,A Horses Role In History,8,18 January 2012,"A movie to definitely see. If there was a modern day war movie that would mind boggle and touch the heart, its War Horse. the story of one horse and it's travels throughout the Great War. Each actor is fitting to their certain role. And not only that, Spielberg manages to capture the heartfelt moments and the nerve wracking ones as well through the most dynamic of ways. To say that War Horse is a movie about a horse is simply blatant. It's more. Its about the role of a horse in history. And how a string of events can lead to the most unexpected of heroes. In War Horse we see just that. The one thing that can show us the hero isn't always the young upcoming stars like Taylor Lautner, but more of the heartfelt animal that we bond with. Other than that of a human relationship/friendship. This is a story of never giving up. No matter what happens. And how through thick and thin, in times a war and havoc, that friendship maintains vitality and perseverance. So through this, War Horse is more than just a horse movie. It's a horse's role in history.",War Horse

It saddens me to report War Horse was truly awful. I think Steven King put this succinctly in his book On Writing: always tell the truth. War Horse did not tell the truth. The relentless drive to charm the audience was insulting and irritating beyond belief. The sweeping vistas with crescendo music were handled like an obese gymnast performing his tumble routine. Perhaps the editing software has a setting called 'epic' for times when the script seems a bit flat. Despite having some expertly crafted elements, it was all a bit meh.",War Horse

I cannot for the life of me fathom why this was nominated for an academy award. In some ways, I wish Spielberg would get out of the ""bildungsroman"" genre and tell a story that has something to do with his own life experience, something that doesn't feel like a yearning for youth remembered in a superficial and uninteresting way.

Then I found out where it came from that feeling nostalgic ...

471,Sunithaya,Worst cinematography since I remember,1,2 January 2012,"I guess the producers of this awfully corny movie chose their demographic very carefully. They knew it would not pass mustard ( or popcorn) with any film savvy audience. No disrespect to those who said it was the most wonderful movie they had ever seen. I went with my wife and 13 year old daughter. They both asked me if we could leave, I promptly obliged, something I don't remember ever doing. I am the type that can see 3 films in a row. I also teach film, so I will be using Mr. Spielberg's movie as a case study in what not to do. I honestly don't remember seeing worst cinematography since the early 40's Mexican exploitation films (that always featured horses!) . Double and triple shadows on exterior shots? Does this story happens in another planet with multiple suns and I totally missed that? Beautiful overcast skies which could have been used to light the scenes with soft light, instead actors in the foreground (including the horse), lit with horrible harsh light in the most amateurish fashion. 3 point lighting in the interior of barns? Light coming from opposite direction from where the source is supposed to be? Mr. Kaminski has certainly done a much better job in other films, including Spielberg's. So what happened here? The buck stops with the director, specially in a production that has been shot digitally with instant access to the shots. Was he absent? Worried about meeting distribution deadlines instead of storytelling. This movie is unacceptable by any modern standard, but the Hollywood machinery will try to sell any sap to an unsuspecting audience. I won't say much about the acting. Fairly decent actors that could have done a decent job in any well directed film reduced to grimacing masks and theatrical silent movie antics. It's a shame. This movie signals to me the end of Spielberg as a credible director, I now suspect he only lent his name for the excellent production of Tin Tin by Peter Jackson who has demonstrated consistently that he has the talent and the craft. this movie is not worth the popcorn, let alone a ""Golden Globe"", are you kidding?",War Horse
472,madderthanthemadhatter,"Somewhat ridiculous, unbelievable and a wasted opportunity",6,18 January 2012,"I have never written a review but I was so disappointed with this film. It looks beautiful and the music is awesome. But it's just so contrived and cheesy. I love a good tear jerker but my friend and I were actually laughing through most of it.I don't think anyone working on the film knows much about horses. They seem to think you can train them by getting them to copy humans. Then a horse will understand it's life in in danger and train his horsey mate the same way. Very bizarre.Also there seems to be a bit of a conflict between whether to show the horse as a participant in a war and the effect he has on people, or to stick to the book and tell the war as if from the horses point of view. There is a ridiculous moment where Joey decides to take the place of another horse in a difficult position and then turns to the camera with a 'knowing' look. I half expected him to wink.****Spoiler*****And how that Albert boy survived the war I do not know. He doesn't seem to have an ounce of sense.

The film delivers exactly what one goes to the movies for............an emotional experience. Yes, it could have been bloodier if viewed from a more realistic ""Hell of War"" perspective, but we all know what that looks like by now. There is no need to punch us with that right in the face. Spielberg sends us the message of pain and suffering yet spares us from the carnage. Bravo for that in these all too exposed times we live in. Take your family to see this film and view it for exactly what it is.

475,JBLinMaine,Great cinematography but not-so-great translation of the book,5,27 December 2011,"If I hadn't read the book, I would probably think it a better movie than I do. It's a beautiful picture and the horses were marvelous, but I couldn't help noticing what was missing and the unnecessary (and unhelpful) things that were added.There's no question that making the movie entirely from Joey's perspective (as the book was) would have been very difficult, and I expected the story to be shaded more heavily towards the humans.But it wasn't shaded: whole subplots were added and they were weighted with Spielberg's sentimentally heavy hand.I will praise one scene, however. When Captain Nichols is shot off Joey, all Joey knows is that he no longer has a rider on his back and, panicked by all the shooting, he keeps galloping. In the book, this moment stopped me in my tracks: sure, of course, Joey is a horse and would have no idea what happened, nor would it occur to him to even wonder about it given how panicked he was by the bullets whizzing by. I was curious how this moment would be handled cinematically and by the time the movie reached this point I was so annoyed by all the added story baggage that my hopes were not high. But it was done so perfectly I turned to my husband who had turned to me and we both whispered, ""Beautiful! They got it!"" If only that had not been a rare event. IMHO the recognition/reunion scene created for the movie (I had thought the book's version was visual enough but I guess I ain't no Spielberg) was not just botched up but so ponderous that I don't think I would have cared for it even if I had not read the book. Time & space do not permit other examples, but there are plenty.My husband noticed a modern red pickup truck in the background of an early scene which no doubt will show up in ""goofs"" lists, so he was happy to spot that.I gave it five out of ten stars because of the cinematography, the horses, and that one brilliantly translated scene.My advice: read the book. It's awesome.",War Horse

The lighting and camera work are majestic and the sunset scene at the end of the movie will remind you of the color used in Gone With The Wind. The story set-up is a little slow and the brief interlude with the French girl and grandfather seems a bit abbreviated to the point of ""why do it""? However, this is a Horse and Boy story surrounded by the savagery of WW1. The day of the cavalry is clearly over when you see a charge mowed down by machine guns. The German soldier even says to a British captive; ""what were you thinking of?"" My throat hurt by the end of the movie from having to stifle some sobbing. Yes, the scenes are set to extract that from you but it is OK because it is what you expect and Spielberg gives it to us on a grand scale. A great animal story, a great war story without the blood and a testament to some good old fashioned sentiment. If there is not a monument somewhere to the War Horses of WW 1, there sure should be.

477,SirchSalic,A great film for most people,8,13 January 2012,"War horse is a story about a horse's life as he goes through ww1. This film is like Forest Gump but with a horse. The horse goes through ww1 and tries to survive and you meet his multiple owners. The horse is really likable and so are his owners. There's a lot of memorable characters and most of them play an important role. However, the reason this film is so good is because of the way it's filmed. It's a basic story, but it's told really well. There's a lot of clever cinematography, and some good looking camera tricks, lighting, and good music. The movie has a lot of atmospheric moments with no dialog, and lets the beautiful scenery and music tell the story. Don't get me wrong though, War Horse has a good story and lovable characters. There's actually a lot of exciting moments too. Like the battle scenes, which are are grizzly and brutal without showing any blood. If I had to find a few faults, I would say that not all the characters are important and are just there to get the horse from point A to point B. These characters can be forgotten easily, but while they're on screen you care for them. Overall, War Hiorse is a good story told wonderfully. It has moments that are both sad and others that are uplifting. It might be too slow for some people, and they might find it boring, but if your not one of them you definitely need to see this movie.",War Horse
478,levilover247,"Absolute letdown, not for children or anyone who cares about animals, especially horses",2,28 December 2011,"As much as I really looked forward to watching this movie, I was completely let down by almost all aspects of the film. The acting in the beginning is almost humorous it was so bad, and I had to consciously remind myself that I was not watching a made-for-television or Hallmark film. I knew the story going into the theater, so I was aware of the fact there was going to be some depressing themes throughout the entire film, but what I didn't know is how ridiculous these scenes would be. Death after death, there is constant suffering for not only the people involved but the horses as well. The constant abuse and torture of the animals( being overworked, abused, shot, left to die) was too much and many of the people in attendance (including myself and my family) walked out after watching the extensive scene where Joey is running through a battlefield, jumps over trenches but SOMEHOW cant make it over the MULTIPLE barbed-wire fences and is at one point in time, flipped over and writhing in pain while wrapped in barbed wire, it was very hard to watch and actually made me and several other people sick, it was so drawn out. Being horse lovers ourselves, it was too much to watch. I am not naive in any way and I was expecting some death and some travesties, knowing that it was a war film, but it was way over the top. I also cannot see how anyone would be comfortable bringing their young children to this movie, it was not graphic in a bloody sense, but just emotionally disturbing. Though Joey and Albert do reunite safely at the end, the deaths of almost everyone else introduced really puts a damper on the entire story.If you are an animal lover, especially a horse lover, I would not recommend this movie to you at all, it can be described over all as:bad acting - unrealistic story - too graphic for children - depressingThe only plus was the beauty of the animal in itself.",War Horse

As disturbing as that was, I could at least justify it as having a point if the story truly was one of hope, perseverance, and triumph; however the trailer is a gross misrepresentation. There is no true meaning to this film other than sometimes dumb luck graces someone's life. The trailer has been artfully crafted to deceive, for example: The trailer shows a majestic horse triumphantly galloping across a WWI battlefield; however the next part of that scene that horse being cut to ribbons as it becomes completely entangled and engulfed in barbed wire! Do not see this film!!! It is a pointless movie that repeatedly depicts the the torture and suffering of horses; and it's being sold the public with deceit. Boycott theaters that show this film!!!

481,cjwilson231,"Cheesy, Over Dramatic, and one of the Best Films of 2011",9,31 December 2011,"War Horse, a Review In the world of Hollywood movie making, few names are quite as renowned as Steven Spielberg. He's brought us everything from light hearted comedies to horror-of-war films to science fiction, and now he's back to remind us all just how good he is. Thus, War Horse, and unapologetically corny, overly emotional, morally simplistic movie about a horse and his boy trying to find one another, and I'd be lying to you if I said it wasn't one of the best movies of the year.The plot follows a young boy named Albert, son of a poor Scottish farming family, and Joey, the horse his drunken father buys to plough their fields. The two form a fast bond until World War I breaks out and Joey is conscripted as a cavalry horse. As he leaves, Albert promises Joey that they'll find each other again.From there, the film becomes something like a series of short episodes in Joey's experience. We see a cavalry charge, a German march, farm life disrupted by war, the struggle of the soldiers in the trenches, and Joey the horse is the only unifying factor. I can think of one or two sub plots that could have stood a bit more expansion or closure, but overall every contained story feels rich and important.It would be foolish to say that this film stars anyone but the horse, but Joey is surrounded by such great actors that it would be idiotic not to mention them. Newcomer Jeremy Irvine has basically guaranteed himself a film career with his performance as Albert, and his father, played by long-time character actor Peter Mullan is a wonderfully tragic figure. Add to this all of the minor characters we see throughout the story, played by actors like Tom Hiddleston (Loki in ""Thor""), Benedict Cumberbatch (Holmes in BBC's ""Sherlock""), and David Thewlis (Remus Lupin of ""Harry Potter""), and you have got yourself one heck of a cast.The writing is overall great, with dialogue sounding natural, if somewhat overly dramatic, but that kind of defines the movie. I also enjoyed that it wasn't trying to shove some kind of message or idea into the movie. War Horse really just is about how awful war is, as seen from one of the lowest positions of that war. One side isn't better than the other, in fact both the English and the Germans are shown to have good men and bad in their ranks. Also, not to spoil anything, but there is a third act sequence involving a soldier from each side meeting in no-man's-land that is probably one of the most improbable and heart-warming scenes in the whole film.Above all of this, though, War Horse would still probably have been a cheep, cheesy drama flick had it not been for Steven Spielberg at the helm. In a movie like this, the cinematography, staging, and, for want of a better word, feel of the movie has to be just right. With a lesser director, it's quite easy to see this bombing, but Spielberg could practically do this sort of thing in his sleep by now. Shots are steady, lighting and effects are outstanding, the scenery ranges from gorgeous shots of the Scottish hills to battlefields just as hellish as those in ""Saving Private Ryan."" Plus, if all this wasn't enough, you've got one of the best scores John Williams has ever written grabbing at your emotions and pulling you along for the ride. Bare in mind, Williams has previously done music for everything from Star Wars to Schindler's List, and I can still call this one of his best efforts.When you boil it down to bare basics, War Horse is a simple, clear-cut, and almost unbearably cheesy drama about a horse and his boy, the kind of thing that is almost never done any more for the reason that it almost never works any more. Yet, against all odds, Spielberg makes it work. Grab the kids, bring a box of tissues for the last twenty minutes or so, and go see War Horse. You will not be disappointed.",War Horse

I have two of my own. I was sadly mistaken. This is a war movie with horses in it -- you do the math. The animal itself was a stunning horse to be sure. The people in the movie were not moving nor even that likable. We never got to ""know"" anyone and I did not feel like I wanted to know anyone. They were not ""bad"" people -- just meaningless. I understand as a horse person that I am more critical to horse behavior -- what is realistic and what is not -- and with a good movie I can suspend that. Not for this one!The main horse and horses around him were brutalized as they were for real in war. Sad fact but true. The ""heroics"" were so implausible that I couldn't get behind them -- the brutality however was real if not tame - I am sure it was that bad and worse.The parts of the story that were supposed to be ""moving"" had more ""cheesy-ness"" than a Papa Murphy's pizza -- very ""Gone with the Wind"" in parts. If they had been well done ""moving moments"" then surviving the brutality might have been worth it. I found myself with my head between my knees, my eyes tightly shut and my hands over my ears so I would not hear the horses' screams.I wish I had NOT seen this movie.

Look, it isn't bad. As my first review I wanted to make sure I didn't over or under-rate anything, so a six is slightly above average for me.The story was definitely solid enough and I enjoyed it.. something always just felt LACKING, though. The cinematography felt forced to me- there were some shots that should have been great, but something about them didn't seem right. The whole film also felt somewhat dumbed down.. it's not that a film like this needs gratuitous violence to be good, but it felt painfully censored. Something that really bugged me also was the flawless English of every German in the film. Are we living in an age where people are afraid of sub-titles? This isn't a children's movie, it doesn't have to be constantly in English! My other major gripe was we never learned enough about any characters to feel for them- it skipped from one scene to another without the audience ever having the chance to grow attached. I feel that this could have been a fantastic, thought provoking film about the futility of war with us attached and feeling for soldiers on both sides had it been given room to breathe, but instead what we got was a jagged mess that didn't really know what kind of movie it wanted to be.All that said, it was an enjoyable enough watch, though. The main horse was a beautiful animal that left even me wanting one as my own, the story itself was decent (though compressed) and I loved the fact that there was never any glaring CGI.

It started off a bit slow but I forgave it for that and still chomped away on my pop corn hoping that I wouldn't consume the whole bucket before any action got under way. Then it hit me and I slumped in my seat and my gut. The set designer for the farm had grabbed a illustration from a Beatrix Potter book and said ""build this"". It couldn't have looked more cheesy, if it was actually a real house they sure did a bang up job on making it look kitsch. I'm still not actually sure just what part of the population this film is targeted at, it seems to waver between being a kids movie and an adult drama without actually nailing it one way or the other. I would have thought with his experience Mr Spielberg would have at least got that sorted from the outset. Human characters are way under developed while their equine counterparts are so over developed I was expecting to see that one of them had been part of the script writing team in the closing credits. The whole film seems nothing more than a vehicle to inflate a horse to a level of a godlike creature to which us mere mortals will never rise to the levels of. By the time the war scenes had actually got underway I'd chomped my way through my bucket of popcorn, guzzled my drink and was in ""how the hell do I get out of here"" mode but I hung in trusting it would all come right though i wasn't sure how. I will say as far as set directing goes they did rather manage to nail The Somme Battlefield so you have to give them top marks for that. Now I was prepared to allow artistic license with some of it, like the tank scene, I mean just where the hell was that tank actually going? But when it came time for the razor wire scene, give me a break, they don't call it razor wire for nothing. Yeah yeah yeah I know it's a miracle horse, they sure got that right. You know all those yummy antibiotics we chomp away on, well in WW1 they hadn't been invented, most men injured died of infections, sorry I was forgetting it's a miracle horse as the human characters keep pointing out ad nausium. Okay so shoot me down with your ""but it's just a story"". well it either is or it isn't. If it's a fantasy let it be but don't try to wrap it up as reality to be flogged off to the masses. By the time we got to the Gone With the Wind ending I knew two things. Firstly i was just about ready to shoot any horse on sight just to prove they aren't divine and secondly knowing the teary eyed nature of the lady with me meant that i was going to get lucky that night. Perhaps that's Mr Spielbergs demographic for this film, the blokes looking for a legal aphrodisiac demographic.",War Horse
489,stefan-263-602656,Unbelievable. Literally.,1,11 January 2012,"before i get going, and so that you may not be lead to believe that i am on an anti-Spielberg crusade, let me clear something up first: i'm the guy who loved Hook! okay? are we straight now? alright, let's go then... at one point, every director must ask him or herself the seminal question: who cares? and, invariably, the answer must at least be: i do! that is a process seemingly absent from Mr. Spielberg's oeuvre as a director of late, not even to mention his work as a producer (terra nova anyone?) the trouble is that, for my money and ever since The Lost World: Jurassic Park, each and every one of the ordinary people he loves so much has been underdeveloped prototypes that count on our now-standardized assumptions to appear challenged by the extraordinary circumstances they find themselves in. it is incompetent at best and lazy at anticipated. worst, though, goes to careless, the state he now seems to have devolved to, spoiling a career built on thoughtful consideration of his self, now outsourced to our expectations of what a ""Spielberg movie"" is supposed to be.from The Sugarland Express to e.t. by way of Close Encounters, it was always evident to me that he took his supposed fun quite seriously. fully-fleshed characters were all there, painstakingly and brilliantly introduced for lasting flavor; their motivations were human and real so that we may allow ourselves to cheer them on without shame or reservation and their meaningfulness was made obvious by the audiences' tears which, in the words of Pauline Kael, were ""tokens of gratitude for the spell the picture had put on (them.)"" warhorse, for me, missed every single one of those opportunities... first of all, let me say this for the record: fade ins and outs are for people who don't know how to finish a scene. and for a director of this stature, in the first minutes of a grand epic, to use them not even to mark the passage of time, but to actually transition from daily moment to daily moment, while still in the expository section as we discover who we are dealing with, is of the weakest lack of confidence this side of The Terminal. in fact, the whole first act of this here slice of a lifetime movie could easily, but for the sweeping harmonies of Mr. John Williams' violins, pass for the director's cut of an over-ambitious Irish spring commercial. let us enumerate the people we meet in the first 15 minutes of this farce: the handsome young teen who falls in love with a horse. - the drunk father with a mysterious, but brave, past. - the dutiful wife whose quiet dignity passes for depth. - the mutton-chopped evil landlord threatening to evict. to call these characters cliché would do them honor. they are but prototypical cardboard cutouts whom able screenwriter Richard Curtis must have been forced to write to defuse a time bomb strapped to his pet turtle, for he was apparently convinced to assume that the audience would be so familiar with these templates that we would happily fill the gaping void left by their lack of motivation or character with what we could remember from Babe. after seeing such carelessness in this and Tintin in the same week, is it possible to conclude that the beard has lost his eye for casting, his ear for dialog and instinct for story?as we journey from English to french to German owners of what we are told is ""a fabulous beast,"" we are, once again, confronted by an American director who does not dare subtitle his foreigners, which is really sad. especially in this movie, in which each dialect lasts for less than 30 minutes, it would have added a sorely needed touch of realism to an otherwise already over-sweetened tale. may it be too forward to say that if you missed the too-subtle ""grand-pere"" or ""schnell!"" you might think all these people are English? not only that but from hot teen English boy to fragile little french girl to portly and sweet German underling, everyone who loves the horse is a raging stereotype of cute and cuddliness. it is also quasi-insulting that a bottle of medicine is all Spielberg seems to need these days to make us care for a little girl whose skeleton, we are told none too subtly, might collapse any second now. here, we are treated to a simple binary system: people who shoot horses: bad. people who love horses: good. but, you'll say, you're missing the point, this is not about them at all, this is about the horse! ah yes, the horse. does anyone care about horses this much that they are willing to take on faith that this one was so extraordinary as to inspire so many sacrifices from all who met it?! all this horse does is run, for 2 hours save for some human fighting in the 3rd act. which i wouldn't have had a problem with but for the fact that he runs for no reason! he is not trying to save anyone, bring a satchel full of secrets from one side to another or even find his original owner, all of which might have been good enough reasons to cheer him on. here, he runs for nothing! and let's talk about the only non-horse sequence of the film. it seems to only be there to break up the sentimentality with a ""see-what-i-can-do-with-war?"" moment from a director who has long-lost his conviction. are we supposed to believe that in the blue glow of early morning in a war during which 100s of 1000s of people were lost, soldiers regain their basic humanity thanks to one animal caught in barbed wire?! i'm upset because this is not adult filmmaking. this is simply doing something because one can.",War Horse

I have read some reviews and absolutely disagree with the term that ""they were great actors but wasted or not used resourcefully in the movie"". These actors have been some of the greatest actors I have ever seen in movie history. Not in every movie you see actors that you actually care if they live or die or that show an excellent demonstration of compassion, love and bravery than this movie. Steven has not lost his touch from his other works of art, such as Jaws, Jurassic Park, Schindler's List, and Saving Private Ryan. He still shows himself as the best in the industry, and I am very happy and honored to see that. This movie especially surprised me in that the music was composed by John Williams. Honestly I didn't really expect John to be making more music composure for movies, but am very thrilled that yet again he has done an amazing job with the movie's music. I think honestly that people who rate this movie as a poor 1 or 2 just don't have good judgement in film and hope with all my heart that this heart whelming story of the bond between a boy and his horse win at least 1, but lets face it, it would be amazing if it won more!",War Horse

Probably only Steven Spileberg could come close to pulling this off and in my eyes and in the moist and damp eyes of my wife and daughter (aged 10) he has been successful.It is a gloriously old fashioned romp of film with magnificent scenery and cinematography from the gods, from the vibrant fields and countryside of Devon to the Flanders fields and the mud and the destruction of the Somme.The film centres around Joey the horse and the people he meets, he somehow in the madness of conflict allows them to find their humanity, this happened then and it still happens now, organisations such as NOWZAD aiding serviceman bringing home their four legged (normally Dogs) companions from their tour of duty.I laughed and cried and cheered this magnificent beast, he is after all the star of the show (and the biggest star since Secretariat!), it pulls the heart strings unashamedly and maybe that is the problem with some of the critical reviews, just like Captain Nicholls and the other brave cavalry men, it's just not British to shed a tear! If you want to be cynical then yes you will probably want to pull this film apart but you know.... for once I did not want to see the graphic realities of war, I wanted to watch a film with my daughter that she could understand the horror's of that conflict without showing the exploited gore of some modern War films. After the film had finished and we had dried our eyes we went for a meal, the whole meal we were talking as a family about the film, and surely that is what it is all about.Mr Spielberg has probably done more in 2.5 hours to educate children regarding the history of World War 1 than any history teacher could do, and he has done it with the aid of some of the truly great scenes in modern day cinema ...Oh and not forgetting a horse (or two!).",War Horse

Nor am I going to tell you that it totally sucked and should be written off completely. I do, however, believe that it is a film that audiences of all ages should watch, because one thing that Spielberg has been successful at, is giving each person something different to take away.The movie's progress is slow to begin with, and probably the most likely aspect to put people off ( I got a little bored ). Along with poor acting and dialogue the audience is left a little irritated by the lack of action, meaning the storyline starts off somewhat predictable. However, 45 minutes in and all previous grievances are forgotten. The ""Dreamwork"" doors burst open and we are all once again invited into the wonderful world of Spielberg. The cinematography is phenomenal and, in my opinion, the best aspect of the film. The doom and gloom of War appears so real you can almost smell the mud and smoke yourself. The film could have easily been immersed in the constant dull, grey, haze of conflict but does well to break up dark scenes with beautiful warm shots and sequences to prevent the film from feeling to ""heavy"", without losing depth from storyline.This is not a film about a horse. far from it. this is a film about family, conflict, bravery, life, death, friendship, and much more. ""joey"" the horse is the silent spirit that enters the lives of numerous characters throughout the film in different ways, fulfilling a specific need, both emotionally and physically and teaching everyone (audience included) something about life. His presence provides the audience with continuity through the chaos of war, and it is only through their relationship with this beloved horse that viewers can empathise with the other characters in the film. like a beacon, Joey reflects and signifies the hope of all that were involved in war. Both heartwarming and inspiring, you do not have to be a horse lover to watch this film. If anything you should watch this, as I did, hating horses and I am sure that by the end, a new found feeling of compassion and respect will be found as War Horse takes you on an adventure through conflict from the eyes of the forgotten.",War Horse
499,tgates-276-262852,"The story of a horse, born and raised in Devon, who tries to find his way home through the horrors of the First World War.",10,27 January 2012,"I first went to see this film with school on a trip. Having previously read the book I was intrigued to see the interpretation Spielburg took on it. The many recommendations and outstanding reviews did nothing to prepare me for the splendor that I saw whilst watching 'War Horse'. Each character was beautifully presented and every actor gave a fantastic performance, though I must say that Jeremy Irvine was incredible as Albert; the fact that he was unknown simply added a depth to his performance as it was incomparable. The portrayal of the war was realistic as far as it was needed. I have studied WW1 myself in History recently (properly, not in sort of 'lets-just-learn-the-timeline' way) and I could not fault it. The reviews that say how 'War Horse' does not give and accurate or educational view of the war have got it wrong: it's not supposed to. It only needs to be so accurate that those watching it will not see obvious mistakes and educational? This is a film about a journey of one horse trying to find his way home through the horrors of the war, and the bonds that are formed in the unlikeliest of circumstances. Not one that will give a factual and educational account of the First World War.When I watched the film, despite having foolishly got second row seats that meant my eyes had to stretch to take in the whole screen, I was enveloped in the story. It went from strength to strength as I cried again and again; not only from sorrow but from relief and joy as well. Yet there was not a moment when you thought that it was all too much to be real, the emotion never overwhelmed you, it just ebbed and rose, flowing with the plot. Overall 'War Horse' is a distinctly moving, beautiful and approachable film, perfect for older children, teenagers and adults of all ages. I cannot fault it, though I'm sure many will try.",War Horse
500,fieldnstream247,Black Beauty meets Platoon,4,28 January 2012,"A sappy, often unrealistic and emotional piece of kitsch. Certainly not Mr Spielberg's finest. Don't get me wrong, I LOVE horse movies. Especially good ones. But this is really simply a bad Hollywood depiction of what people with little to no horse experience may think. The animal (actually several as can be clearly seen by markings and body type) is anthropomorphically depicted as a thinking noble creature (better than man?) that understands things like heroism, courage, loyalty etc. The training of these horses is superb - 10 points go to the horse trainers. There are so many points throughout the movie where you'd say ""really? come on!"" while seeing simply bad special effects (such as the cavalry charge through the high grass and the German lines, the plowing scene, the fact that all dead horses are in the exact same position and of the same body size (did they get a rebate on some cheap plastic forms?). The last scene is so Hollywood - the apparently worn out, tired heroes are coming home... and the horse is jigging all the way uphill. Why they had to arrive home in a fake sunset is another kitsch moment. And why did they use these phony accents - it would have been better to let the Germans and French speak their respective languages and have subtitles. The part at the french farmer's house is another weak point... how unlikely that a teenage French farm girl (in 1915)would know about show jumping events at the Olympics at a time when there was no TV and equestrian events were only held in 1900 and 1912 (Stockholm). Finally, the makeup of the horse after being extracted from the barb wire was done poorly... anyone who has seen what a barbwire fence can do to a horse comes away from this scene thinking how lucky that horse to have only a few scratches. They didn't even remember to have the horse carry some scars in later scenes...what were they thinking? But there were some good elements, too. The trench warfare scenes were generally well crafted, and the people that handled the horses were generally shown as caring and good, regardless of what side they are on. This was a movie and a story that could have been turned in a spectacular movie, but sadly they messed up big time. Don't see it if you know horses and are easily disturbed by poor realism and cheesy kitsch.",War Horse

You see my grand dad was a big farmer back in Bosnia, he loved his horses, some of them were working and some he just enjoyed riding. I remember as a kid, i couldn't wait for school year to end just so that i could take a bus and go down to the country, my mom would put me on this first bus that leaves at 6am so that grand dad can pick me up after his farmers market visit. I'll never forget the day when his horse felt down while pulling this long wood log, he fell on its side and just set there cause he couldn't move, my grand dad moved over so quickly to him, started whispering, and talking to him like to a child, he petted his neck and his head, within 15 seconds or so, he got up and moved the log up the hill. Then sometimes i'd catch him in stall talking to his horses and my god, it would look like they all standing up in front of him, facing him and listening. Once i said that to my grand mom, and she said thats nothing, his horse brought him home back one night, after he lost control over his cart one night, cart broke but his horse grabbed my grand dad with its teeth and brought him home 15 miles a way from his house.

504,mysteriax16,"Heartfelt, beautiful, and epic - a masterful stroke of movie-making by Spielberg and a magical cinematic experience.",10,9 February 2012,"What a movie.This film was the thing that impelled me to write my first review here, as I feel the need to do it justice after a handful of cynical reviews discrediting it for awkward reasons. Before I get into the subject in question, let me make clear that I am a Spielberg fan; so if this review feels biased in any way you have my apologies. So, to make things clearer for all to see, I am going to break down the strengths and weaknesses of this film from different aspects. First of all, the story was great. Sequence after sequence it enthralled me, gripped me and moved me like no other film before. Its simple, comprehensible, funny, moving and sentimental in a good way, and it inspires the mind and provokes the thought in such a way so many films have tried and failed to do. For unlike many other blockbuster films nowadays, which contains nothing but mindless action sequences and blood and gore and excessive sex, the story has heart. While cynics may point out that the plot was too unbelievable and sappy, I fear they have missed the point here. After all, what's wrong with a decent children fairy-tale, even for grown ups? For me, I go to the films to escape from reality; to be swept away by stories of wonders and miracles and the impossible. The only minor quip I have with the story is its length, as I feel War Horse should have been longer to allow more space for character development. Not wanting to spoil too much of it here, I give the plot a 10/10.Secondly, on the directing - it's Spielberg - what's more, it's an on form Spielberg - what else do you expect but the cream of the crop? Every frame and scene of the movie was shot with such passion, skill and grace, that it is impossible to find fault with the directing at all. Directing: a solid 10/10.The acting was the only uneven aspect of the entire film. Jeremy Irvine was quite outstanding for a first-timer, delivering a heartfelt performance as Albert, the horse's owner. Tom Hiddlestone, Emily Watson, Benedict Cumberbatch were great as well, but the others were only mediocre. The French girl's performance was cute and innocent but not wholly convincing, whereas the actor playing the role as her grandfather was quite good. But the real stars of the show were of course the horses, who galloped and neighed through every scene with such genuine performances, you should be disappointed that they did not get an Oscar nod for best actor. Acting: 8/10The screenplay was definitely good, delivering some beautiful lines, but not great. The script was more than serviceable yet a few alterations could have been made to make the flow of the story more natural. Screenplay: 8/10On a technical level, the film is flawless. Every scene is a to behold. At times one would feel that War Horse is visually a polar opposite of Schindler's List, and while the latter is a grim, harrowing black and white, War Horse is eye-candy. Each scene was painted with such lush color and hue, you can't help but feel overwhelmed by it. One particular scene featured in an orange-and-red sunset was amazing, reminiscent of the glory days of cinema. The sound mixing, cinematography and editing was spot on, and it seems that the crew has knocked the ball out of the park here. Technicals: 10/10The score by John Williams is the best he's done in years, as good as the ones in Star Wars and ET. The music was one of the key elements of the film; there was a touching scene whereby I was already entranced, and the tears were clinging so frantically onto my eyes, and then – Presto. In came the score, and it pushed me finally of my edge, and before I knew it I was crying like a baby. Definitely Oscar worthy. Score: 10/10The impact on the audience was astounding as well. I cried, I laughed, I went awwww... and the cinema cried and laughed and awwwwed with me. You could feel the tension in the cinema when the film reaches its climax; the audience so gripped, so touched, and not a whisper was heard in the cinema, only few emotional sniffs. After the movie, my family couldn't stop talking about it on the way home. Even until the next day, we were still discussing about it whenever the subject was brought up. Audience Impact: 10/10Last but not least, the message. The reason I felt the compulsion to add this category here is because I feel that too many films nowadays are promoting wrong messages and morals(try Twilight). This has filled the vulnerable minds of young people with disgusting notions, mostly about violence and sex. That said, the theme of this film was really good. It is an anti-war movie that shows all the ugly sides of war, and joins Saving Private Ryan and Schindler's list as part of Steven Spielberg call for universal peace. There are life lessons to be learned from this seemingly simple story. Message: 10/10.Final verdict: War Horse stands out as one of the best war films of all time, a poetic portrayal of the love between man and beast, a perfect family film, and for me, the best film of 2011 and deserving the Best Picture in this year's Oscar(whether it will win I cannot say – I have yet to watch The Artist) It is also a worthy addition to Spielberg's already incredible resume, not to mention his best film since Saving Private Ryan. An early candidate for Film of The Decade. Final Score: 10/10.",War Horse

Honestly do not know what Spielberg was thinking when he thought this was a good idea, that horse must have had some unbelievable jokes or thought provoking conversations because instantly after being around the horse for about an hour, people became so magnetised by it that they just stop the middle of a war and start trying to coax it over with a series of clicks and whistles, before a soldier risks his life going over the top for this particular horse he's spotted from a far in a war/film where just 10 minutes prior to this about 20 horses die and nobody bats an eye. Then the doctor decides to disregard his wounded soldiers and treat the horse instead, calling the horse a soldier because it belongs to this lad, even though a second ago was going to put it to bed.

Joey the horse was given way by Albert's dad Ted to the army to fight for second battle of the Somme. Captain Nicholls said that he would look after the horse for Albert. The horse has travelled a long time all around the country, visiting a family, other sides like the French side and more and got into their hearts. I have fully enjoyed this film I would encourages the public to come and see WAR HORSE!! War horse was a great film but at the same time is very moving a lot of people cried because a lot of horses die but I would not recommend this film if you love horses.",War Horse
507,oktoberstorm,The Music of John Williams,4,14 March 2012,"A movie hard to sit all the way through, mostly because it reaches out to a very specific audience, and no-one else. Script, direction, production, music, everything is masterly tailored towards that particular demographic. It's like they ran this movie to an audience, took their criticism and corrected the movie over and over again until everyone in their control group was happy.Unfortunately this particular movie was so overdone in polished clichés that if you're out of that sweet spot you will most certainly lose anything you ingested the last hour before watching this.So for some people this is a masterpiece, after all it's made just for them. But others may find this extremely bland, the characters almost superfluous in their lack of depth, the script sounds like Spielberg movies fan art, and the music actually was my cue to write this review.As an instrumentalist of many years and a small-time composer, I was curious about what John Williams would do with this movie. And the soundtrack suits the movie quite well. Perfectly I would say. Because who else that the revered John Williams, who possess five Oscars and a nomination for almost everything he touches, could write a score so clichéd as to match the movie perfectly in every sense. His handcraft is superb, and he sees that lack of depth and matches it with his own pastiche over Vaughn-Williams and English countryside nonsense. Spielberg and Williams worked together on Schindler's List, and it's a bit puzzling to see their names on a movie like ""War Horse"". Being in tune (...) like that on both movies show that they know exactly what they're doing: Selling a piece of work, a work which for them (and all the other regulars) should be an easy feat. Easy, and lots of money because of their obvious target demographic, Easy, because they don't have to look forwards, but ack on what sold the most for the last few years. Now I won't speculate in motivation for doing this movie in the first place, but there's a good chance you'll relate to this sentiment when/if you watch this movie. I will give this movie four stars, only because the handcraft is impeccable. The next four stars are reserved for originality, experimentation and depth. The last two is reserved for a league this movie never had the chance of even coming close to.NB: Think about it - If ""War Horse"" came in 1993, and ""Schindler's List"" played today, they'd be masterworks both of them. Not this way, which is ridiculous.",War Horse
508,rtvrtv,Very very difficult to watch,1,27 April 2012,"When I heard Spielberg was making a WWI movie I was very excited. With Saving Private Ryan, he revolutionized how war movies are made today. Then I watched this movie. I somehow made it through the whole thing, full of it's clichés and general corniness, i think cause i was waiting for a good war scene or something. I have nothing but bad things to say about this movie. It was the biggest disappointment I've ever had in a movie and a person (Spielberg) in my life. I hated this movie. It's so awful. It's been over half a year since i watched it, and as I write this I am still angry. Terrible terrible movie. It almost seemed like a parody of a bunch of corny movies all put together in one but without the humor. What a waste of money and time. This movie has made the world a little worse.",War Horse
509,goshamightygeewhiz,top ten best comedies!,1,19 April 2012,"We decided to rent the movie ""War Horse"" the other night and we about went into hysterics! We laughed our asses-off until we were silly! What a spoof movie! We fell off the couch when the black horse, lying in the dirt, CLOSED HIS EYES and died! We were so spastic at that point we had to press the ""pause"" button to recover! We decided we'd have to have a couple of magnum sized Margaritas if we had any chance of surviving the remainder of the spoof! We downed about a gallon of fresh made top-shelf Margaritas, refreshed ourselves with mangoes and strawberries, and continued to watch the comedy. We ""lost it"" again at the end when the horse, ""Joey"" was last seen staring into the sunset! We had no idea that ""War Horse"" was a comedy and we are troooly amazed that it did not get an Oscar for best comedy! We had no clue that Spielberg would ever direct such a classic ""April Fool"" joke! We sure are glad we didn't buy it, though. What a waste of money that would have been! ""You'll laugh! You'll cry! You'll kiss twenty bucks GOODBYE""! Later, the Old Lady wondered why they didn't just go ahead and put eyebrows on the horses like they did in the animated movie, ""Spirit: stallion of the cimeron"".OBVIOUSLY there was not a single soul in this production that knows one single thing about horses!",War Horse
510,Alma_johansson,A disappointment,3,9 November 2013,"To me it is pretty obvious that Spielberg is trying to re-create the touching emotions and sentiments films like Schindlers list and A.I. gave us. Well, this failed completely. This is not touching, there's no depth. The characters are empty and the only thing they actually do possess are glittering eyes and cheesy expressions. I am watching maudlin dramas all the time. Sometimes they reach my heart, and sometimes they simply don't. Most of the time the actors are a huge part of that. Now, I don't really blame the actors in this film, it's not easy to act like a Russel Crowe when you get a script full of clearly melodramatic dialogues and monologues, but still I have to admit; I don't really understand the thinking behind the choice of actors. Maybe there's a sense to that which my star-actor-fanatical-mind simply doesn't understand.The only slightly impressive ingredient in this movie would be the fundamental idea to the concept and plot, even though it may be something we've all seen before. Also, I can't deny the photo and music obviously are very beautifully made, so that's of course always a plus. So, to sum up: clishè and cheesy but the concept is pretty okay,, though that's not nearly good enough. All in all; Not really a good movie, and not something I would recommend, though it goes from 3/10 to 4/10 only because of the photo, and a bit because of the music.",War Horse
511,grahamlaird,terrible,1,8 June 2012,"One of the worst films I've ever seen. Outrageously predictable from the word go. Very slow. Not very convincing acting. Terribly unengaging, even for myself (a regular contributor to Greenpeace and WWF). Despite the plight of the animal derived plot, this is the only film I can ever remember turning off half way through and I am a pretty big film buff, with at least a 1000 films under my belt. Additionally this is the first review I've written on IMDb. Shame on you Spielberg. Really very poor for Spielberg, wondering where his motives now lie. With his rereleases of star wars and the ""resurrection"" of Indiana Jones in the last few years it all feels a little indulgent and financially motivated. Think he may have lost his touch.",War Horse

The plot or should I say the lack of plot was amazing. I am sure a high school kid could have written a more riveting piece. The characters were thin and one dimensional, the director must have had a off couple of weeks cause the the whole movie lacked everything. I am an avid movie watcher. I wish I never watched this dribble. I watched this with great anticipation cause I love any WWI or WWII movie. The period is one of my favorites. I feel like Steven S should give me a refund and burn the entire project. I vote this the worst movie of 2011.",War Horse
513,rolf_grens,Oh no dear god why? Why?!?,1,14 July 2012,"When i was growing up in the lush hills of my native country of Sweden the name Steven Spielberg meant something. Hearing the name Spielberg made me and my countrymen remember Indy Jones, ET Jaws. And then he blow our collective little minds with his movie magic with films such as Jurassic park, and saving private Ryan. Jurassic had my kid brother literary climbing the walls of our local cinema in sheer youthful terror at the sight of the realistic evil little lizards.For my part Ryan was and is still one huge pile of greatness. The name Spielberg was a surefire way of knowing that you were going to be on one heck of a thrill ride when seeing one of his movies.I mean Indy shooting that sword guy or harassing that poor Chinese midget? Classic! But somewhere along the line Spielberg must have suffered a stroke that has been kept quit or been abducted and replaced with one of them surrogates from Bruce Willis bleak masterful prophetic movie with the same name.Cause this can't possibly be the same person can it? Can it? And if it can, then help us god...What can you say about war horse that hasn't already been covered? Its a 2.40h blazing poop wave of sap and ham fisted acting.Right from the start where Lupin somehow is alive again (and a bit of tool) forces jovial and lovable drunk Irish farmer into waving a bidding war over a horse.Or as the movie war horse subtly puts it, the most super awesome honey dipped pantspeeingly amazing horse ever EVER! The horse plows a field, runs by a car which is puttering along at the neckbreakingly speed of 5miles per hour, but did not stop a burning child from crying or end poverty or won the dance audtion or even saved the rec center. So it did nothing that would warrant its status as a godlike being.But i digress, wasn't my meaning to give a blow by blow of this either magnificent poop-storm of a movie but i can't help myself cause it got me really upset dang it...I rented this movie, and it promised me the feelgood movie of the year, ""a magnificent and gripping epic tale of friendship bravery and love"" ""Spielberg has done it again he has!"".But i really just hated it.The horse Joey was said to change the life of everyone he meet. And did he ever? Two stout German youths with outrageous accents (why the hell were the Germans doing speaking English? i mean come on...)get shoot.Then this prissy lil girl who was so sweet n cute and cutesy that my teeth ached has some cutesy scenes where somehow Joey the horse has them fooled of his godlike status by doing absolutely nothing.Its a kinda of a bad movie when you feel a smile coming on when you hear that this little girl will die horribly of some sorta disease. Really? will we get to watch? please please please?? But no.And don't get me started on the whole thing at the end when the evil salami maker is going to buy Joey for 30 pounds and the cute girls grandfather comes out of nowhere and offers 100pounds for it..and is prepared to sell everything to buy joey back.This whole scene with its heartfelt speech made me gag on my own bitter cynical hateful bile. 100pounds? Really? 100? When all you had to do was raise to 35-40 pounds tops? Why does it have to be such grand gestures? Why does Spielberg try so overly hard (and sloppy) to try n pluck at our collective heartstrings? Its insulting to say the least.To summarize, i saw an episode of fear factory few weeks ago where the contestants had to drink blended rats. I really think that would have made a more entertaining evening then watching Spielbergs latests mouth fart of a movie.And what the heck was with that music? Do we really have to have 80 violins squeaking every scene to cramp the seriousness or whimsy of each scene down our collective necks?",War Horse

Beautiful film, that will most likely be appreciated by an older generation...as i cannot see too many teens of today, really getting it.

516,inutoriluvsu,"Great Story, Just not for Everyone.",7,10 December 2012,"OK, instead of going into a long and boring story about why I watched War Horse I'm just going to get straight to business. For one I really enjoyed this movie. Personally I thought the scenery was stunning and the movie was generally appealing to the eye. The actors also did a great job at there roles, however I didn't really connect with any of them. For example, the two Russian boys. I really wanted to sympathize with them, or even shed a tear (because what happened to them was tragic), however I didn't find the need to. It could be Steven Spielberg's fault for having them act playful despite just running away from the army, or it could've been the actors fault for not emphasizing the characters feelings enough. I don't know, but either way there were just some parts of the movie that left me bored instead of crying like I was supposed to.Next let's discuss the overall flow of the story. I believe the beginning sequence of the horse (Joey) growing up could've been done a bit better. It came off as rather clunky to me. However as the story progressed I sort of got used to the method Spielberg was using. In the end I though he managed to pull it off rather well. There are some parts that I didn't care for much (Topthorns death, the Russian boys (again), etc). Yet at the same time I found myself really engrossed in other parts of the movie. Mainly the story of Emilie and that one Russian soldier who was there when Topthorn died. Finally there were parts that I didn't dislike, but also didn't really freak out over. This mainly being the death of Captain Nicolas. Again I really wanted to feel bad, but there was just no real reason for me to shed a tear.I'll go right ahead to the conclusion now. When Albert first called out for Joey at that war ""hospital""(not really sure what to call it, so I'll go with that) I actually smiled. Sure, a bit cliché, but it was one of those feel good moments for me. Then when he was told that Joey was to be sold, as usual I didn't really care much. It was one of those moments where you already knew how the movie was going to end, so you don't really care about what happened next. However when Emilie's grandfather showed up, I found myself crying. In my opinion one of the most emotional scenes in the movie was when her grandfather said, ""The war has taken everything from everyone. He is all that I have left of her."" That scene really hit me. Their story seemed to leave the biggest impact on me. I'm not sure why, but I really liked the scene with both of them. Their relationship just made me smile (especially when the grandfather brought out the saddle).So basically overall I would give this movie a 7.5 (or 7, considering there is no 7.5 option). It was great, but did leave plenty of room for improvement. The story was more of a rough road than a smooth river in terms of storytelling, but in the end it still managed to deliver the general idea. Though I don't think this is a movie for everyone (which is clear to see from the comments in the message board) I would still recommend it. Some parts were cheesy yes, and some of the scripting left much to be desired, but in the end the pros and cons generally balanced each other out.And I just wanted to add something. Many people seemed to think that the movie was meant to be all about Joey and his struggle. On the contrary, I think he was really mainly a way to tie everything together. The story held multiple tales of different people. So although the movie is called War Horse, it wasn't really about Joey as much as it was about the other characters. However this, like everything else, is just my opinion.",War Horse

518,swillyuk,Worst...movie...ever!,4,2 January 2013,"30 seconds in, I realize this is going to be sentimental claptrap. The lighting is stunningly bad, with scene after scene lit by a variety of different colored suns clearly not of our galaxy. At one point out in the pasture 'in broad daylight' horse and rider have multiple shadows as if running through a floodlit stadium. Did someone just plain forget to Photoshop in some CGI lighting, or have directors completely forgotten how to light a scene without digital enhancement? My irritation soon turned from lighting to the lousy, cheesy music. The generic score is straight out of the 1950's. My mom would love it, it's just like the Waltons. It's the next best thing to canned laughter to let me know how I should be feeling. Can you guess which instruments are coming next. Uh oh...this bit looks serious...here come the cellos. Now he's being chased by a goose, are those whimsical flutes I hear? I know all movies do this but this is outrageously over the top.Finally the music stops, at a point where the horse become War Horse as he is sold to the military. For a while there's just musical silence and that improves the movie no end.Now for some action. It's pretty good, but there are some scenes just hard not to laugh out loud at. Black horse won't be able to pull the heavy artillery gun, oh no...not with those long gangly legs, so War Horse springs into action to take his best friends place. Really, did that just happen?Then we get to the trenches. Probably a little too clean and comfortable as far as historical accuracy is concerned. Also in the spirit of historical accuracy, the 50 extras filling both 'ours' & 'theirs' trenches don't really capture the scale of 2.5 million involved in the Battle of the Somme, or the best part of a million corpses on the battle field. They, of course, are neatly cleaned away to give center stage to the horse. This part is well done and for a while is worth watching. Which just leaves the big sentimental ending. Assuming its perfectly reasonable for a horse out of hundreds of thousands of horses to find its former owner from the millions of soldiers there cause that does happen,do we seriously expect the massed ranks instinctively part like the Dead Sea when they hear a blind man's hoot owl call? Wouldn't the walking wounded than just see 'food' and close in on the horse like starving zombies?Acting throughout is a little wooden, pick of the bunch is David Thewlis, but accepts are generally dreadful. Ooh ahh West Country bumpkin accents seem to develop an Irish twang. Ze Germans sound anything from Scouse to Cockney Chavs, innit? Just wondered, and not wanting to spoil a good yarn, but why was there even an auction at the end? I thought the military had leased the horse for the war, the war is over, so surely they return the horse to its rightful owner then cue fake sunset of the Wyoming dust bowl. I will no longer be use Oscar nominations as any indication of quality control.",War Horse
519,arturos,The worst cinematography in decades,1,26 December 2011,"This will be a short review. I don't remember ever walking out of a movie, but I did this time. I usually choose my movies carefully, based mostly on who is responsible for it. I never expected this sap from Spielberg, although I have lost a lot of respect for his work as a producer after trash like Transformers. I won't talk about the bad casting, and self censorship a'la Disney, but I was really offended by the horrible cinematography which I will use in my film classes as a case study of all the amateur mistakes that are unacceptable in student movies, let alone in such a big production. Multiple shadows in exterior shots that I had not seen since bad Mexican movies of the 40's, harsh artificial light coming from absurd places where no light sources exist, back light rims on overcast skies, multiple suns in every shot (does this story happen in another planet?). Really Mr. Janusz Kaminski, who was minding the store? certainly not you since you have lit better films before, but the buck stops with Mr.Spielberg This was the second feature I saw today after the extraordinary TinTin in which at least Spielberg teamed with real talent. To me this film (War Horse) marks the end of an era for what was once a great filmmaker, sad, I know.",War Horse

I can't believe anyone actually liked this movie. I kept thinking that if it weren't for the war scenes, the movie was targeted to adolescents, as the story was presented in a simplistic, unsophisticated way. Many times I thought of ejecting the DVD but I did not. Now I wish I did.This film is good for a laugh, due to its ridiculousness and sickly sweet feel.

521,willy_evs,More than just a War film,7,18 February 2013,"Steven Spielberg does it again. His latest motion picture, War Horse, is far more than your average war film. Spielberg uses the film to reach out to a broader audience; War Horse provides the perfect balance of action and heartache, melded together by the friendship of a boy and his horse.The main star of the film, the horse, Joey is born and sold to a farmer who is broke and foolish enough to buy him. The farmer's young boy, Albert, trains the horse to plow a rock laden field, a task even the toughest of work horses would struggle with. This is only the beginning of many hardships Joey has to face throughout the film.The film presents itself with gorgeous, breathtaking visuals that are sure to please almost all viewers. The beautiful countryside setting of England and accurate representation of farms and villages at this time period (World War I) capture the audience and take them back in time. Steven Spielberg does a brilliant job of capturing footage from the horse's point of view as he runs from various dangers or charges into battle.The first half of the film is slow but necessary and mainly consists of relationship building between Joey and Albert. Their day to day training sessions and days on the farm strengthen their bond and trust for each other and ultimately the viewer's relationship with the pair. As a result of a failed fall harvest Joey is sold into the cavalry unit and separated from Albert. Here the film splits in two, following Joey and Albert on their new paths.Joey's path is winding and war filled. He switches hands and sides in the war several times throughout the film. The audience is introduced to each individual Joey encounters. The audience is presented with the opportunity to connect to each individual through Joey. With every change of hands Spielberg has the audience fearing for Joey.Albert's path is not much easier. He tries to enlist in the war but is denied because of his age. Soon after he is of age Albert enlists, determined to find Joey. He then finds himself on the front lines in the trenches where there is plenty of action. It is here he faces no man's land and is temporarily blinded by tear gas. The audience has all but lost hope at this point as it seems Joey and Albert will never find each other.Albert is blind. Joey is mud covered and injured with a pistol to his head, destined to be put down. It is then the film reaches its heart wrenching climax, leaving the audience wondering if they will get the happy ever after they have so desired since Joey and Albert's separation.",War Horse
522,cpbotts,Sentimental drivel,1,20 April 2013,"Great director. Great cast. Great performances. Bad film.Why? Several reasons really.The script is as derived as it gets. The dialogue was clichéd. The plot was predictable. And the story was completely unbelievable.Yes the cinematography was good, but film is visual story telling and this story was not good, that is unless you still love LASSIE films or you are a ten-year old child. In that case you will probably like this movie.Of course I couldn't let the gross animal abuse go unmentioned. I get the whole special effects this, but this film was reminiscent of films like Ben Hur where horse were nothing more than breathing props to be destroyed after the shoot was complete. On this level Spielberg should be ashamed of himself.All in all, it seems to me that Mr Spielberg has either lost his edge or, worse, lost his desire to make great films like he once did. It appears now he focuses on sentimentality and/or the business of making movies.So if you are expecting WAR HORSE to be something that will move you or something that will leave you thinking then you will be disappointed. This movie is about as far from the caliber of films like SCHINDLER'S LIST, MINORITY REPORT or MUNICH as you can get.I think good old Steven needs to decide if he is going to be a director or producer because clearly he can't do both.",War Horse
523,bobolee,Toffee coated horse manure. Spoilers ahead.,5,20 May 2012,"A toffee coated horse turd of a movie. Spoilers ahead.We start off in the Devonshire countryside with a pre-14 yo farmboy called Albert, who could easily pass as a 22 year old. Albert never ages in this movie, he lives in perma stasis that by the end of WWI he looks exactly the same. Albert is also incredibly dull. ""Obssessed Horse loving bore"" would summarise Albert, there are absolutely no other qualities or personality quirks that would pass him off as a real human being. The movie spends a croccodile tear inducing first 45 minutes of the movie establishing this horse love romance. Albert might as well have been grooming the young horse and waiting until it hits the age of consent. Albert isn't interested in other human beings, you know, things like dating girls and talking to his parents about things other than the horse. I guess one day he would like to settle down with Joey the Horse, get married with Joey the Horse and have kids with Joey the Horse. His character is so utterly one dimensional and bland.The father is a drunk alcoholic with some clichéd guilt complex about his war hero past. He spends his life savings buying a horse on a scriptwriters whim. The horse has claimed its first victim and now Albert's family can't pay off the rent. Dad sells off the horse to pay off the debts and Alberts dreams of a happy future with Joey are shattered. Joey decides to fight for Empire, King and country and enlists in the British army. He meets ""black horse"" who becomes his best mate throughout the war.It turns out Joey is a good runner, so much that it participates in cavalry charge in homage to the Battle of Waterloo. I guess Spielberg needed an entirely pointless cav charge because it looks good on screen, especially with the Napoleonic era musket smoke in the background that pops out of the ground. Actually my mistake, make it two cavalry charges. Joeys British Officer is shot dead. The horse claims its second victim.The horses fall into the hands of the Imperial German army. We are introduced to the German officer ""bad guy"" who has an obsession with shooting horses in the head. He's our clichéd villain for the rest of the movie. Some cowardly German soldiers, who speak really good English, look after Joey and its friend. They use the horses to escape and become deserters hiding out in a windmill. The angry German army hunts them down and shoots them dead. Joey has claimed his next two victims.Fortunately Joey is discovered by a lovely French girl (who also speaks really good English) Emilie who looks after it for about 3 days until the German army discovers it. Her grandfather goes on about some schlock on bravery and doing things and this and that, that made her cry. Don't you worry, because shes an owner of Joey, she too by the end of the movie will die.Joey signs up with the German army again to fight in the Battle of the Somme. Evil German officer guy goes around shooting tired old horses in the head. Being the hero he is Joey saves his tired old ""black friend"" horse from said Evil German officer, chins up, cue the Rocky music, drinks raw eggs, lifts weights, and busts his legs lugging howitzers up muddy hills. Still, Black horse friend eventually kicks the bucket, and Joey goes ballistic. So much that he ends up running the trenches into no mans land and creating himself an admirably large necklace of razor sharp barbed wire in the process.Then the famous save the horse truce scene. This would not have happened in 1918 when the German army was on its last legs and truces explicitly forbidden. Plus no soldier with give a darn about a horse except in this warped toffee coated version of 1918 trench warfare. Tommy and Fritz (who happens to speak really good English) cut Joey free. I'm surprised the evil German officer guy didn't come around to threaten to shoot Joey, but don't' worry the scriptwriters will get a British guy to do that later on.I hope you've brought your Kleenex out for the last part, because Spielberg pushes the wet syrupy sentimentality into your face as subtly as a sledge hammer. Joey reunites with Albert in these overlong, forced, boring, contrived and utterly patronising scenes. The entire British army looks on in muted silence, as Joey slowly, steadily, step by step, slowly, about to get shot in the head but moves, slowly, looks towards Albert, about to get shot in the head but moves, takes another step.....you get the idea.Thank god the end is nearly up, not until Emilie's Grandpa spends a kings fortune on the miracle horse because he's lost his girl. Grandpa returns Joey to Albert (remember, Albert never talks about anything except his horse and how much he loves it). Offscreen, Grandpa jumps off a bridge because of how appalling this movie has been treated by the scriptwriters. Albert and Joey return to Mount Doom, sorry, Devonshire in yellow tinted cheese, get married, had kids and lived happily ever after.=========== I couldn't stand this movie. To summarise, its manipulative and pushes overly long periods of sentimental schlock to get it's point across. The characters are dull. The plot points are ridiculous. The only likable human character in the entire movie turns out to be the chubby German soldier who looks after the horses. The horse is cursed, whoever ends up owning the horse is screwed over some way or another. It's only saving grace are the decent war scenes, the authentic dirty look of WWI trenches, and beautiful, lush cinematography. 5/10.",War Horse
524,joel-richardson,Probably the most bored I have ever been in a cinema...,2,18 January 2012,"As a non-horse lover, I was sceptical about seeing War Horse, but the emphatically positive reviews won me over. I don't want to exaggerate, but the film was amongst the least interesting two hours I have ever spent. Many films are dull, but entertaining in patches; War Horse only rarely strays into 'watchable'There is barely even the semblance of a plot for much of the film; the horse encounters various different groups of people, however none of them are given a chance to truly develop before they are killed off. Unsurprisingly the horse lasts through until the end of the film, so suspense is totally lost.That would be fine, if the characters weren't so vacuous. Other than the soldiers with the wirecutters and the old man on the farm the horse is comfortably the most interesting character in the piece, and if I'm honest he didn't even excell as a horse. In particular Albie is one of the most one-dimensional characters in any film I've seen, and to make matters worse his one dimension is that he really really loves his horse. If he had been given even a trace of personality then I might have cared that he'd lost his horse.I possibly come across as heartless, but if I'm honest I can't think of any moments in the film when I was even aware I was supposed to care. Someone near me in the cinema clearly had tears in her eyes at the end, but unless they were in despair at the eternally lost hours of her life I can't really understand why.It's worth 2 stars rather than 1 because the cinematography is (at times) excellent, and the fifteen minute period where Joey runs wild and is then cut loose is very well done, if not especially original. If any other character in the film had the personality of those two soldiers then perhaps the film could have been saved.",War Horse
525,lan1-822-798191,Nearly the worst ever!,1,19 October 2013,"I could often hear that people dislikes movies because they are unbelievable. Sometimes I wonder why they hail films like this one, but says that others like our Swedish film Hamilton is unrealistic. This one wasn't only unrealistic, it was so overloaded with clichés, that me and my family didn't know if we should cry or laugh. And of course, why can't Germans and french speak in their own language? Must the Englishspoken World listen to everything in broken English? It is just as strange as a lot of countries has to dub every film. Youjust can't get a realistic feeling when everyone speaks English!Two questions came to my mind after seeing this: Emely Watson: Did you only do this for the Money? Is something wrong with my family or what went wrong with the human kind?",War Horse
526,skirkman2,War Horse is an amazing story about a horse that makes it through four years of war to be reunited with the boy who raised him.,9,15 December 2013,"War Horse was a stunning movie to watch. The characters Albert Narracott (Jeremy Irving), Capt Nicholis (Tom Hiddleston), and Ted Narracott (Peter Mullan) all put on amazing performances. But the real star was the horse Joey. Joey might not have had any dialog, but the movie was the portrayal of Joey's life through his eyes. A young boy, Albert Narracot, could tell from the beginning the colt he saw from birth was going to be special. His father, Ted Narracott, goes to market to buy a plow horse. He wants to show up his landlord and buys an overpriced thoroughbred horse, Joey. The overpriced horse ends up being the same special colt Albert saw being born years earlier. Albert raises the horse and proves everyone wrong. The thoroughbred is able to be used as a plow horse. However, the field was ruined by a flood and Ted Narracott was forced to sell Joey to Major Nicholis. Albert tells Joey that he will find him no matter where he goes. Over the next four years, Joey goes through many hardships. Albert joins the war to find Joey and be reunited. Both Albert and Joey kept the faith that they would end up back together again. War Horse is an amazing story about a horse that makes it through four years of war to be reunited with the boy who raised him. Like the movie Black Beauty, both films follow a horse through their lives, starting at birth. Both horses go through both good and hard times but ultimately end up happy. My favorite part of the movie is when the camera films the horse's eye. This is to represent you are seeing the scene through the horse's point of view. Then angle is great because you see the whole scene through the eye. Another great shot is when the director captures Joey running through ""No Man's Land."" Joey is jumping over trenches, barbwire fence, and puddles. He eventually gets caught up in barbwire. Men from each side of the war come together and rescue Joey. They knew he was a special horse. Nothing ever survived ""No Man's Land"" until Joey, the soldiers called him War Horse. I am a horse lover and I would recommend this film to any other horse lover. Horses are very loyal creatures and this film portrays that loyalty. Both Albert and Joey never gave up on finding each other again. Reference Guest, R. (Executive Producer), Spielberg, S.

527,Kayleighhoyles,Brilliant film. Truly moving !,9,30 November 2013,"After watching this film for about the fifth time, I decided to look at the reviews of it here on IMDb! I was shocked from the amount of people have gave it 1 star, so shocked that I felt the need to register and post a review myself. Now I am a girl who does like most genres of film, however usually I don't tend to like war films or award winning films. But warhorse is an exception. Everything about it is fantastic. The story, the soundtrack, the effects, the acting. For me, there is nothing not to like about this film. The horse (which is adorable) is passed from different people during the war, I ended up caring for all the characters that the horse encountered including other horses. The film is a long one, but I don't think there is anything that they should have cut out. The film really tugged at my heart strings , I laughed and cried. My mum practically drowned herself in tears. I have not met anyone who does not like this film. Children, teenagers, and adults. A lot of people who have reviewed this film badly are picking fault with it for stupid reasons. One person moaned about Spielberg's use of transitions..... Nothing's wrong with fade In and fade out transitions.... Not that I even noticed the transitions because I was too busy actually watching the film to care about that sort of thing! Nonsense from an over- educated media studies student probably who over analyse everything! Being a former media student I am aware of how you are taught to look for these things, But just switch off and enjoy it maaaan!If your looking for a Sunday afternoon film, or up for a bit of an emotional roller coaster, this is the one!",War Horse
528,harrisnicole-871-104194,General Movie Review,5,15 December 2013,"The unbreakable bond of a friendship between a child and horse can be thought of as the plot of this movie. The movie War Horse (2011) entails about one boy's love for a horse which develops a fulfillment of sorrow and happiness throughout the film. The horse, named ""Joey"" is the star of the show. Joey was born in the grassland of England. He was forcefully stolen to the military, traveling most of the world as a war horse as viewers witness his journey through his eyes. Albert Narracott played by Jeremy Irvine, is the young boy who becomes attached to Joey and is determined to train Joey as plow horse for the farm. Ted Narracott played by Peter Mulan is Ted's father who is foolish enough to buy Joey in an auction to be used a plow horse for the family; so they can grow turnips in order to pay rent to the landlord, played by David Thewlis. Joey was not considered to be a plow horse, being that his legs were not built for it and would give way. Ted is portrayed as an insignificant drunk in the movie, a man who cannot ""hold down his pint"" and supply for his family (Guest & Spielberg, 2011). Rose Narracott played by Emily Watson is Albert's mother, the voice of reasoning in the movie. She was outraged when Ted bought the horse, but always loved Ted no matter what preposterous decisions or actions his made. The theme of courage prevails in the movie. Courage shows through Albert when he stops at nothing to train Joey to be a plow horse, even when being humiliated when people from the town gather around the fence to watch Albert do the impossible with Joey. Joey's courage saves him and his friend's life, Topthom, by having the courage to be collared for the Germans to haul injured soldiers and being brave enough to pull heavy artillery up a hill, which is a suspenseful part in the movie! The movie also intrigues the World War I experience through the voyage of Joey, which is filled with moments of sorrow and joy. Joey's delightful and loving spirit uplifts the lives of others who cross his path on his journey as a war horse. Joey's courage in his journey gets him a step close to reuniting with Albert. The movie in a sense has similarities as the movie Black Beauty (1994), in which a young boy tries to reclaim his horse, which passes through several hands over the course of the movie. As far as the acting in War Horse (2011), I didn't see the accents convincing enough to be authentic; it seemed to be exaggerated. I had a difficult time distinguishing the French and the German accent from one another, and was confused whether the girl and the grandfather were German or French. Ted's old war scarf that Albert tied on to Joey represents the motif in the movie. It is ""repeated throughout the film"" reoccurring throughout the movie with each person Joey encounters, but it really doesn't have a significant impact of the movie; it just reminds reads that it was tied on to Joey before was sent to war as a promise they would reunite once again (Boggs & Petrie, 2008). Their was ample amount of close-up techniques used in the movie to only allow the viewer to focus their attention only on the significant person or object (Boggs & Petrie, 2008).The courage shared between Albert and Joey make the story remarkably encouraging and uplifting. Even with being involved the most sinister war (World War I) known to man separating these two apart, they still managed to find each other. ReferenceBoggs, J. M., & Petrie, P. W. (2008).

529,Stephenpeltz1997,One of the best Military Movies of All Time,10,12 January 2014,"Wow. I mean this is definitely one of the best movies I have ever seen. I literally walked out of the theater still speechless I couldn't talk for hours. It was so good. The Journey and love behind it all was just so amazingly done, I've never seen a movie work those two together so well. This is honestly the to me, the top five movie of the century. Top three for military movies of all time. The beginning to end your on the edge of your seat waiting for the next thing to happen and wham. Then back to the edge of your seat. I can honestly say that this movie almost had me crying. I didn't but got really close. To me I really felt apart of that movie. I'm proud to say I've seen this and like I said, one of the greatest Military movies of all time.",War Horse
530,trenf1,1918: F&$king horses,8,8 April 2014,"Plot line - Horses, Farmers, More Horses, Cheekbones, Evil Germans, EVEN MORE HORSES!, World War 1 sucked, HORSES ARE AWESOME!In short there are a lot of horses in the movie up until the 100 minute mark where they suddenly disappear and are replaced by every World War 1 movie ever made, then more horses show up. The horses in the movie are beautiful looking creatures but there is just way to much of Joey (The titular War Horse) and they even give him a really weird love story. Also Tom Hiddleston and Benedict Cumberbatch are great in there scenes together, i really could watch a whole movie about nothing but them bickering as soldiers in 1918 France. The Germans and French also speak perfect English throughout the whole movie and occasionally speak German at random and never speak french at all which really takes you out",War Horse
531,tvoye,Beautiful Cinematography,2,8 April 2012,Did any of the people associated with making this film read the book? The book is just wonderful. The film is gorgeous to watch. The story overall is bland and completely misses the point of the book. How can you spend almost an hour of set up that took the author of the book 15 pages? Leave out a KEY relationship between Joey and another horse which completely destroys the opening act. This is a horses story not a story of the people who he makes contact with. This one dimensional approach to the story takes the heart out of it. You have to understand Joey to get the full impact of the story. Sadly this part of the film was left out. Yes it would be difficult to get inside the mind of a horse as the author of the book did. But this is Steven Spielberg. I expected a heck of a lot more...But at least it looked and sounded nice.,War Horse

533,chathelo,An emotional movie,8,19 May 2017,"This film is about a friendship between a young man, Albert, and a horse during World War I. Sadly, they are separated by the war. During the film we can see the War with different viewpoints : the horse, Albert, and all people who meet. We liked this film because there are lots of emotional scenes, a good story with a marvellous setting. Steven Spielberg shows a new face of WWI. That is why, we can say it is an unforgettable movie.However,it is a little long. Then some scenes can shock the young public. To conclude, if you can see War Horse, watch it !",War Horse
534,dusserrelaetitia,a wonderful story,10,4 June 2018,"This film offers a different approach of the war film, through the horse for whom you can develop sentiment and attachement. Sometimes the scene can be really hard at the psycological level because I think it's a film which can make us think on the humanity. In my opinion in this film the horse appears more human than the Man.",War Horse

536,brown-valerie,"War Horse Needed More War, Less Horse",4,28 December 2011,"It was as though two directors made two different movies and then said- hey, why don't we put these together. The first third of the movie takes place in England and is too long, too sappy, too formula. The stock characters are all there: the hard-drinking dad who has feelings but keeps them well hidden, the stalwart hard-working mom, the evil landlord, and of course, the stars-in-his-eyes hero. But once the setting moves to the war in France, my interest picked up. I can't think of another movie where the use of horses in battle scenes was this well done. Those scenes were quite moving, as were the scenes in the trenches and on the battlefield. I wish they had made one movie for 12 year old girls, and another movie about the last war were horses played a real part.",War Horse
