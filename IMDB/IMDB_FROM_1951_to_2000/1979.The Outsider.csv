0,Leofwine_draca,Small fry time-passer,6,24 April 2020,"THE OUTSIDER sees Netflix explore the darker side of Japan as it tells the story of a gaijin, or westerner, who finds himself enveloped in Yakuza society after helping a prominent gangster. Jared Leto plays the main role rather impassively and I couldn't help but wish for someone with a little more character to essay the part, but never mind. Generally this is serious, slow-burning viewing; the plotting as it plays out turns to be entirely predictable, and it suffers at times from having characters making ridiculous decisions for the sake of the story (such as a veteran crime boss walking nonchalantly into an ambush without a second thought). However, the cinematography is strong and the film looks good, even if the characters turn out to be wafer-thin, and it doesn't shy away from the violence either. Small fry when compared to personal favourites (like Beat Takeshi's OUTRAGE), but this still passes the time amiably enough.",The Outsider
1,kosmasp,Slow and painful,8,17 May 2018,"Just because a movie has a snails pace, does not mean it can not be brutal and violent in spades. We got one of those cases right here. It's about honor and loyalty. A major part of the movie is in Japanese (with subtitles of course), but our main character is an english speaking one. Which is the old ""stranger comes into town"" kind of thing.In this case his invasion into this culture that most westerners may not be that aware of, is really the driving force. He does learn fast, but he is also human, so he does have some urges and he has feelings too (even if sometimes you may think otherwise). Brutal, honest and without really taking compromises, this may feel too long for some, but will be a masterpiece for others.",The Outsider
2,classicsoncall,"""You are a stray dog. But today you may have a home.""",7,31 March 2021,"If you're ever confronted by a Japanese crime boss and he tells you to give him the finger, he's not asking to be sworn at. Chances are it's going to hurt..., a lot. Which made it odd that Nick Lowell (Jared Leto) could nonchalantly cut off two of his digits without bringing even a tear to his face. Try biting your finger and you'll see what I mean. If you get into the flow of this picture it moves along kind of seamlessly, but there are oh, so many contradictions involved that it removes much of the credibility from the story. Like the stated aim of Yakuza members voluntarily giving up family life to swear loyalty to the boss. But then Nick continues his relationship with Miyu (Shioli Kutsuna), even after her brother Kiyoshi (Tadanobu Asano) warns him off, thereby committing not one but two infractions against Japanese gangland culture. Not only that, but Kiyoshi then gives Nick a ceremonial 'daisho' sword with which to protect Miyu's honor, after learning that she became pregnant!There's also the confrontation between the Shiromatsu and Seizu clans that results in the death of Shiromatsu boss Akihiro (Min Tanaka), resulting from Orochi's (Kippei Shîna) traitorous turn. In retaliation, Nick barges into a Seizu family meeting and slashes his throat, with no consequences! Seizu boss Hiromitsu (Nao Ohmori) simply tells Nick to go on his way, returning to Miyu to close out the story without too much trouble. I'm no expert on Yakuza, but much of what occurs in the movie simply wouldn't happen in real life, though it does make for an entertaining gangster flick. Seen that way, you can have a decent time with ""The Outsider"", realizing that it's outside the realm of possibility.",The Outsider
3,Wizard-8,"Okay, but doesn't reach its full potential",6,2 June 2018,"There are some really good things in this East-meets-West film, but I have to admit that I am in the minority here, and I didn't think the movie was completely satisfying. I'm not saying it's a bad movie, because the movie does shine in some key areas. The whole package has a good visual look to it, capturing post-war Japan extremely well; this is certainly not a cheap-looking film. And the idea of the movie - a westerner finding his way into a side of Japanese society traditionally closed to foreigners - is certainly intriguing, and does lead to some very interesting moments. Western viewers who are interested in Japanese culture will certainly get a lot of insight.But as good as the movie gets at time, there are some things that hold it back from being a really great movie. For starters, there is the pacing. While I am glad that the movie was not extremely fast-paced - which would be inappropriate for a serious-minded movie like this - all the same I have to admit that it was a bit slow at times. A little tightening here and there would have worked wonders. The biggest problem, however, is with its characters. I don't think the movie got into the heads of its main characters enough, particularly with the Jared Leto character. We learn practically nothing about his past, why he decides to join the yakuza, and what is going on in his head. He is such a bland character, it's hard to care about him one way or another. I admit that I am glad that I saw this movie, since there is some really good stuff here and there. All the same, I don't think the movie is as good as it could have been. Yes, see the movie, but don't get your expectations too high, or you might be very disappointed.",The Outsider
4,deloudelouvain,Much better then I thought it would be.,8,3 April 2018,"Well this movie clearly deserves a higher rating then it actually gets for now. If you like mob/gangster movies then you will definitely like this one. At least I did. It all looks very stylish, but behind the style there is some hardcore violence, something you can only see in Mafia movies where the honor of the clan comes before everything. The Outsider tells the story of a caucasian former GI soldier that gets recruited into the Yakuza. Jared Leto played the perfect role, as the calm but coldhearted newbie. The rest of the cast, are all Japanese, and they all agve this movie a great touch. The story is well writen, never a dull moment, and add on that an excellent soundtrack that brings you in that special gangster mood. One of the better Japanese movies I ever saw if you ask my opinion.",The Outsider
5,Hellmant,"Beautifully shot, and fascinating to watch mostly, but it's also kind of pointless.",8,16 March 2018,"'THE OUTSIDER': Four Stars (Out of Five)An action crime-drama thriller, set in Japan after World War II, where a former captive American soldier repays his debt to his old cellmate by joining the Yakuza. It was directed by Martin Zandvliet (who also helmed the critically acclaimed Oscar nominated World War II film 'LAND OF MINE'), and it was written by Andrew Baldwin. The film stars Jared Leto, Tadanobu Asano, Shiori Kutsuna, Kippei Shiina, Emile Hirsch and Rory Cochrane. It's received mostly negative reviews from critics, and it was released by Netflix through it's streaming site. I found the film to be beautifully shot, and fascinating to watch mostly, but it's also kind of pointless. Nick Lowell (Leto) is a captured American soldier, during World War II, who escapes a Japanese prison with the help of his Yakuza cell mate. Once released, Nick feels he must repay a debt to the cell mate by joining the Yakuza. He quickly becomes immersed in that violent criminal world. This causes a lot of conflict within the Yakuza, for accepting an outsider.The film is yet another story about a white hero (antihero definitely in this movie) in a foreign land. There's not a lot of character development as well, and the lead character is actually pretty unlikable too. Still it's masterfully filmed and executed, at all times. I was always mesmerized by the visuals happening on screen, even if I didn't care for any of the people involved in them. So I definitely have very mixed feelings about the film, but it does have a pretty classic climax too (that's pretty stunning and memorable). So I have to recommend it.",The Outsider
6,peterp-450-298716,A pretty good slow paced Yakuza-movie.,7,8 August 2019,"When you dishonor your boss
and you want to show remorse,
you give your finger.
It's called otoshimae.
I see you've got all your fingers.Even though I don't have any affinity with Japanese culture as such and mostly ignore Asian films, I couldn't resist giving ""The Outsider"" a chance. Not only because of the fact that Jared Leto is playing in it (a colorful actor who reminds me of Johnny Depp and because of his role as The Joker in ""Suicide Squad"" can join the club of quirky Hollywood actors), but also because of the central theme of the Yakuza families. I wondered if this could be another successful Netflix original.I don't know much about Japanese culture. Only the term Yakuza is known to me. You can see it as the Japanese version of the Italian Mafia. The only difference with their Italian counterparts is that the Yakuza members are an epitome of inner calmness and adopt an intimidating attitude by using ice-cold, angry looks and a threatening, non-loud tone during their conversations. Quite different from the Italian mafia members, who usually want to make an impression by shouting and intense gesticulating while making their point, after which a rival gets a concrete pedestal and they dump him in some Italian river. So I prepared myself for a Japanese-colored ""Godfather""-like movie.The first thing you could criticize is the pace of the film. ""The Outsider"" is extremely slow at times, indeed. But doesn't that suite the entire Japan concept? After all, members of the Yakuza families themselves use a certain pace in their conversations by using impressive silences between sentences. On the one hand to show respect. On the other hand maybe also to increase the impact of used words. Have you ever seen a Geisha passing by? They aren't exactly a paragon of speed. And to be honest, if this movie had lasted an extra hour, I wouldn't have minded that either. And that's because of the other positivities you can find in ""The Outsider"".First of all, I thought the acting of the entire cast was marvelous on all fronts. The mix of authentic Japanese who speak their own language for most of the film instead of constantly using broken, bad-sounding English and the acting of Jared Leto was simply stunning. How Nick Lowell ended up in an Osaka prison, remained a mystery to me. He's the only English-speaking prisoner and is surrounded by mainly Yakuza gang members. Rescuing the Yakuza Kiyoshi (Tadanobu Asano) from a perilous, life-threatening situation gives him a ticket to freedom. And that's when he chooses to gradually integrate into the Yakuza family. Not an easy task since the members of this Yakuza family aren't really hospitable and are rather resentful towards white strangers (a Gaijin). However, I wonder if, in reality, a Westerner would get a chance to be included in such a Yakuza-family. I doubt it.The used cinematography in ""The Outsider"" was also generally sublime. Maybe a little too dark at certain moments, such as the prison scenes, for example. But in general, the setting in this post-war Japan is really impressive. A mysterious metropolis with dark, narrow alleys, clubs where Sumo wrestlers compete and smoky night clubs. The only thing that tries to break through this darkness is the sometimes bright neon lights.
Expect some violent scenes too. You can't do without it in a gangster movie, I guess. There are quite a few victims. Lots of gunshots and knives carving around. Even a self-mutilation scene where a few fingers are sacrificed isn't missing.My limited knowledge of Asian film material and Japanese customs made sure everything came across as fairly authentic to me. Others, who immersed themselves in this matter, may have noticed imperfections. And perhaps the content has all been done before. I even read somewhere that there was a lot of fuss about casting Jared Leto. And the term ""whitewashing"" came up. Didn't we have the same discussion about Matt Damon's contribution to ""The Great Wall""? By the way, I thought Jared Leto was suitable for this role as the silent (probably because he doesn't speak the language), cold-blooded and emotionless Nick. He reminded me a bit of Keanu Reeves in ""47 Ronin"". Only the speed with which he was accepted in the Shiromatsu Yakuza clan, seemed greatly exaggerated. And the emotional relationship between Nick and Miyu (Shioli Kutsuna) felt like a mandatory item.But just as I scoured the internet for information about ""The Zodiac Killer"" after watching the movie ""Zodiac,"" I couldn't resist consulting Wikipedia about the Yakuza phenomenon. That means this film also left an impression. If slow crime movies about the Mafia interest you, and this in a Japanese environment, then I can definitely recommend this movie to you.",The Outsider
7,truemythmedia,"If You've Seen Any Mob Movie Ever Made, Then You've Already Seen This",4,13 May 2019,"The biggest issue with this film is its tendency to fall back on well-tread clichés; there are scenes when I was quite literally able to call the exact dialogue spoken before it was said, and there are other scenes when I was able to call what would happen as far as action. There are very few surprises throughout the film, because ""The Outsider"" feels like every other mob movie you've ever seen; the subplots and characters are all those that we're familiar with, and just because the story takes place in Japan instead of Brooklyn or Hell's Kitchen that doesn't make the film more original.
Another big issue with this movie is its blindness to its own White Savior complex. I feel like this film tried to be culturally respectful, but as Nick climbs the ranks of the Yakuza, and he becomes more and more ingrained in their culture, the plot starts to lean in the direction of elevating Jared Leto's character beyond just an ideal Yakuza. It starts to feel like the film is saying, ""Look at how good this outsider has become, he's better at being a Yakuza than the Yakuza."" He starts to solve their problems for them; starts to behave more honorably than them, and soon, some of the other Yakuza members begin to look at him as a leader. Now, sure, we've seen this kind of story happen before (think ""The Last Samurai""), but in a world more frequently upset about race inequality, it's surprising to think that this storyline of white-man-comes-in-and-fixes-your-problems-for-you didn't raise any red flags before it was green lit.",The Outsider
8,elliotjeory,A good slow burning Yakuza film,7,17 August 2018,The cinematography of this film was excellent. It is a slow burner and brutal in some scenes however If you like Japanese culture you will enjoy this film. Not for gaijins :),The Outsider
9,omendata,"Stylish , dark , brutal, authentic!",7,26 April 2018,Reminds me of the Yakuza (1974) with Robert Mitchum combined with Black Rain!Stylish and dark beyond darkness; the brutality is almost clinical in its precision and execution just like the movie.Critics - What do they know - there seems to be a difference between what critics say and the reality of what we all like and what is genuinely good!This was a good film!,The Outsider
10,leftbanker-1,Stylized Film with the Substance of a TV Commercial,5,16 March 2018,"First of all, it's too long. These days it seems like the majority of films go two hours. Huh? Two hours is reserved for epics. Two hours is for closers (by the way, Glengarry Glen Ross went an hour 40 minutes).It starts off looking great, but then it falls short on the first event in the story. He saves a guy who was hanged by some other prisoners, but we don't know who anyone is, and we don't know what is going on. It's poorly written and completely lacking in tension. This first chapter sets the tone for the movie: style over substance, cool black suits and nowhere to go. The movie looks great but the story is completely empty at every step. The prison chapter wasn't adequately developed. Then the outsider steps into the Yakuza organization with the ease of someone getting a job at Wal-Mart. The love story made little or no sense, and then the ending was stupid. So often writers think that violence is the same thing as tension, but you can have a whole load of violence that no one really cares about and it won't have a bit of tension or meaning. You can have a scene with no violence that is loaded with tension. I like this sort of story, build it up so people expect a ton of shit to hit the fan and then resolve it with intelligence. Of course, sooner or later you need to pour on the violence, but you can tease it out for a long time. And then they move to another scene that is loaded with tension when he shows his respect to the Yakuza boss. Then there is an induction ceremony that is pretty cool.He slits a guy's throat in his own kitchen? Why would anyone do that? That's very dramatic and all, but think about the clean up. There are a lot less messy ways to kill someone for almost no reason. The entire scene was stupid and completely pointless. Once again, there was zero tension, it was just a bit of what we call gratuitous violence.The whole thing devolves into a bloodbath that makes little sense. They go to a meeting where everyone is supposed to be unarmed and it turns out that some of them are armed. Imagine that! Who would have thought that a Japanese gangster would go back on his word?",The Outsider
11,phanthinga,Good yakuza flick from America,9,23 June 2018,It hard to find a good yakuza movie and when it come out staring Jared Leto a white male actor surrounding by an all Japanese cast people love to label it as a white savior movie when the actual context of the movie is about a man running from his past and try his best to adapting a new enviroment.The Outsider to me is just a classic crime tale but this time set in Japan that remind me of The Yakuza from 1974 also from America.It people still think a white yakuza is impossible then let me share fun fact there actually a black samurai named Yasuke that serve Lord Oda Nobunaga during 1581-1582 and I love to see his tale on the big screen one day,The Outsider
12,PsychoBeard666,Full disclosure: I gave up after 30 minutes,5,3 August 2019,"When a film gets panned by critics, I ignore them and give it a go.
When a film gets accused of ""whitewashing"", I sigh at the hypersensitivity and give it a go.With both of these things in mind, I gave The Outsider a go.The critics were right.
The accusers were right.I only lasted 30 minutes so the rest of the film could be awesome for all I know. What I do know is as good as an actor as Jared Leto is, the story should focus fairly on the Japanese characters in Japan, not give the one American all the cool things to do.",The Outsider
13,Jithindurden,Atmospheric,6,19 March 2018,"The plot is generic with a white guy in Japan trying to be a part of the yakuza but a film is not all about the plot. The 50's Japanese period setting the lighting, the acting and the whole atmosphere is quite fascinating and engaging. The characterization is also intriguing but ultimately not fully realized. With a generic plot and some unused aspects the film never has a chance to be great but the atmosphere it created, which for me is the most powerful method a director can use in a film, was captivating.",The Outsider
14,danielmanson,It's not bad. Little slow,7,18 November 2021,"The film has been out for a little while now and to be honest I had no idea about it, just stumbled on it and the premise looked good so I watched. All in all it's not a bad watch, but I have one huge problem with it and that's the pace of the film.Is it worth watching? I'd say so. It's not going to blow you away or anything, but it's by no means a bad film. There's some good action and gore involved and the plot keeps you intrigued throughout. However, as I'll mention below, I had one major annoyance.So as the title says, it's a bit slow. Jared Leto's character doesn't really speak much at all during the whole film and it's very much centred on him. Now I understand why the director chose to do it this way because he's the ""outsider"" here, but the problem with this is that the film just felt so slow. You don't realise how important dialogue is to a movie until you watch one that doesn't have a lot of it. Important scenes don't hit as hard and just the overall pacing felt slow and flat.I wish we had some more depth on Leto's character and the Yakuza family more. We didn't get much, if any, at all and I felt like this plot could have done with that added depth to let us relate to the characters more. This, the lack of dialogue and the slow pacing I just had this disconnect with the character.So yeah overall it ain't a bad watch, it's better than average (only just). I've given 7/10, I feel 6.5 would suit it more so I rounded up to be nice.",The Outsider

Like in THE WALL, the guy is supposed to be white, see the film before you judge. That is the heart of the film called ""the OUTSIDER"". There are some gritty prison scenes and a few interesting twists and turns but overall the downfall of this film is I just don't care about the lead. I got bored in the last act and didn't even stay to see how it ended, that is how in-invested I was. This is just a slow ride to nowhere. Skip this",The Outsider
18,dallasryan,Worth Watching for Leto,6,12 June 2018,"I thoroughly enjoyed this film until the last 30 minutes of it as it took a nose dive towards the end. The script became contrived and some of the characters were doing things that their characters wouldn't be doing, but the script was making them do it. Jared Leto plays a very interesting, quiet, calculating character in this one and it's a great performance in the same respects of the quiet, calculated mob characters such as Al Pacino's character in The Godfather, etc. An interesting movie, but it could have been great if the ending would have paid off.

We see Nick gaining trust with the Shiromatsu and even becoming one of them.Nick falls in love with Kiyoshi's sister, but this is not the focus. The Shiromatsu family betrayal is the main story's focus. This focus leads to a generic plot without much ingenuity.Nick hides something, but the movie does not explain this secret. One major scene exposes this secret to the audience, but that scene raises questions never answered.The ending focuses on keeping the movie an epic.

I can understand using a car a few years newer, but six years? And perhaps there was something lost in translation, but the dialog was laughable. ""You have a cute face."" says a Yakuza member, referring to Leto. His adversary replies ""Then why don't you take him home and pet him."" And later, ""Your skin is so soft. Can I lick it?"" Huh? I wonder when watching a movie of this caliber, how did a talented actor like Jared Leto (and Emile Hirsch, as well) agree to sign on. And did he ask himself, ""How did I end up in this mess?""

It is poorly written (Andrew Baldwin), poorly Directed (Martin Zandvliet), poorly acted (Jared Leto) and poorly edited (Mikkel E. G. Nielsen).The idea of a film set in immediate post-war Japan and the inevitable rise of corruption and the battles over turf, is a compelling one. Unfortunately, there is absolutely nothing compelling about this film.After Leto's release from prison (we have no idea why he is there or why he is a total sociopath, but we presume the yakuza have the juice to get him out) we see him being driven from prison in a beautiful Chrysler Imperial. We are told the year is 1946, but the Imperial is a 1960. That's a pretty big error and a harbinger of bad things to come. Leto thinks that speaking seldom and softly is menacing.

It is beautifully produced and it is predominately in subtitled Japanese.
The Japanese cast is very good.
The films greatest weakness is Leto's face, starting with too much of it and then his decision not to do anything with it.Too bad. This describes diminishing potential:
Michael Fassbender was considered to star in the film when Daniel Espinosa was in talks to direct. Japanese filmmaker Takashi Miike was slated to direct the film with Tom Hardy in the titular role. However, the search for a new lead after Hardy's departure from the project conflicted with Miike's own commitments, which caused his dropout as well. Jared Leto was confirmed to join the cast on April 5, 2016.Both Fassbender and Hardy have the presence to take the minimalist approach and still convey 'dangerous' and either would have matched what comes from the Japanese cast.
Leto just looks like a punk who was told lack of emotion equals tough and everybody else gets credit for professionally pretending he has weight..
Essentially, the pivotal character isn't.
But... there is much to enjoy on the yakuza side.",The Outsider
32,paulijcalderon,"Mediocre, but somehow enjoyably intriguing",6,11 March 2018,"I've seen a lot of negative reactions to this movie, and I can understand the reasoning. The narrative approach goes a usual route and it's not so inventive as a whole. Yet I couldn't help but enjoy the experience somehow. It's easy for me to get drawn into this mysterious crime world in Japan. There are intriguing elements for sure, but nothing too surprising. You won't get an action film which appears to be what many were thinking. Turns out its centered on atmosphere where you follow a vessel-like character. I can see why someone would be bored. Your main character isn't so open and there isn't a sense of urgency. Weirdly enough for me it feels like the slow burn helped me get more immersed into what was going on. At times I felt like I was next to the driver's seat as the car would enter into the dark underground world and its traditions. I can't say the entire movie was interesting. There are some halts were the drama didn't land. Still, for every dull moment you sometimes get an engaging one. The beautiful aesthetics are always stimulatingly great to look at, but they weren't utilized to the fullest.Jared Leto is subtle and grounded here which is refreshing since he has in recent memory most been known for playing weirdos. There is also this intensity in his eyes which makes him all the more believable as a violent gangster man. I've liked Tadanobu Asano in everything I've seen him in and here he delivers another great performance with many nuances. A shame that he was a little underused. It's weird because I really saw that the movie was mostly mediocre surface stuff, but I was hooked and enjoyed it nonetheless. I would usually not recommend a movie like this.

The high point for me...it may be intentional, may not. Definitely not a ripoff. But there is a point in the movie where I see parallels with the first Godfather.

35,boris_unanimate,"If you enjoy Japanese culture and history, skip this one",4,13 September 2018,"The Outsider is possibly one of the worst movie I watched in recent times. It was written by a man who obviously knows nothing about Japanese culture, let alone the yakuza, but wanted to come off as knowledgeable. It contains so much, but says so little. And Jared Leto doesn't really make the movie any better. Only Leto can make a movie about the yakuza look dull and boring. Basically the same role as in Blade Runner 2049, but more sleep-inducing. I liked the color and costumes but it was wasted on a weak plot with even weaker results. I usually don't enjoy Leto, which is mostly because he either takes his roles too seriously or not seriously enough. Here he seems like a wooden doll the people around him push around Osaka and wait for things to happen to him, instead of engaging. The movie's potential was squandered on a story that seems to go nowhere and only revolves around Leto's character and the terribly acted out relationship with the yakuza brother's sister. Glad it was on Netflix. If you want a real yakuza drama, watch Ichi the Killer, Sonatine or just give Kill Bill another view. The exposition in the movie is so forced, you can predict every scene and it bores you forcefully. Everything I enjoy about Japanese culture was made to look trite instead of deeply fascinating. Even The Wolverine looked more traditional than this. Great production value makes it look greater than the movie is. Would definitely not recommend.",The Outsider
36,ryanwinning1,They finally got it right,8,11 June 2020,"This type of film has been attempted many times before where the yakuza bring in a westerner into their gang, and it always seems to break down and get sloppy and cheesy somewhere along the line. This film really nails the difference between Japanese culture and how discipline in all aspects is emphasized where as in western culture being friendly, outgoing and playful almost to the point where the Japanese would consider obnoxious is actually the way of life for western culture. Jared Leto is really the one that keeps your attention constantly drawn to the movie because of his impressive ability to maintain his posture in this character who's completely gone all-in for his new Yakuza family and completely rid himself of American tendencies and it's the body language that reflects this all through the film. I can think of Vigo Mortensen in ""American Yakuza"" as one that just couldn't get that aspect of the role and therefore the whole film was less believable because of the unspoken elements of the acting. This was a great movie to escape from the standard movie experience we're used to seeing.",The Outsider

Not sure what th deal with Metacritic rating it so low because I found it to be above average compared to most streaming originals. If you don't know the story, go ahead and watch the trailer, and for me, I was immediately drawn in to it by the trailer, because I'm a big fan of Asian crime films. And this film was not a let down in nearly any way. I loved the story, such a unique one in the time of super hero garbage and needless remakes of classics. The story pulled me in and the world it creates is a well represented one, definitely channeling other very successful Asian crime films. The action was true to the genre and definitely satisfied me.Unfortunately not all the actors shined. Don't get me wrong, some had great performances, but others just seemed to be playing themselves, which I hate. As I said before, the world is well put together, seems very authentic with pretty good cinematography. I didn't like the pacing at some parts of the film but that really had no effect on the enjoyable experience. So I would say this is a pretty decent breathe of fresh air to see on Netflix, better than the majority of bombs that they put out into the public.I would highly recommend it.",The Outsider

With the neatly turned out Yakuza members all looking the part in their suits and neat hair. I found myself intrigued by what was happening, and what would happen, while never siding with any particular person.The only negative I have is how many parts remained unexplained and/or were skipped over. For example, how did Nick (played by Jared Leto) end up in Jail at the start? Why did he turn on his military 'buddy' who he served with in such a gruesome way (save for the fact the film wanted to show his ruthlessness and loyalty to his new life). That said, any longer and the film would have felt too long... so it's a balance.Highly recommended for anyone looking for a steady, ruthless but 'driven' film.",The Outsider

How is that when Kiyoshi makes it abundantly clear to our main character not to be with Kiyoshi's sister, but he's fine with it when Nick knocks her up?Why was it alright for Nick to just barge into the Seizu clan meeting, kill one of their new leader members, and just be let go unscathed?

This Netflix Original tries to experiment with the less talk and more acting type of storytelling which is not often seen in the genre of crime thrillers. For an out and out Jared Leto movie, The Outsider is more than 70% Japanese.The movie follows the story of an American soldier imprisoned in post-war Japan who enters the Japanese Mob Family, Yakuza after befriending one of them while in prison. The support cast of Tadanobu Asano, Kippei Shîna and Shioli Kutsuna are amazing throughout but no gaze goes past the intensity of Nick Lowell, portrayed by Jared Leto. The intensity and honestly he brings to his character is beyond words. The story telling style and the exhaustive usage of Japanese in the movie makes it difficult to convert 'The Outsider' into a fast paced thriller that it could have been. The way the movie ended was a bit anticlimactic and was open ended, probably with the intention of bringing out a part 2. I would go with the title 'The Insider' for part two though. I would recommend this movie to anybody who is a fan of Jared Leto and likes slow-burn crime drama's.

I didn't love this movie, I didn't hate this movie. There are a few good scenes, but that's it. Most of the movie is a drudge.

Jared Leto did a superb job. People say that he was expressionless, but the point there is the other gangsters are never able to rattle him, no matter what. It makes him incredibly effective, and interesting because you never can gauge how he will react to a situation, but then he usually winds up doing the most ""gangster"" thing possible. The movie doesn't have a lot of dialogue, and some reviews said the dialogue was stupid - really that was intentional because the Japanese speaking gangsters did not speak English well, or even want to speak English. So the things they said in English sometimes sounded off the way someone whose native language was not English would be. The movie was very well paced and I just didn't want it to end. The only possible criticism I would have is this movie probably plays to some Japanese stereotypes, and also the fact that an American comes over there like Rambo to join the Yakuza was a bit forced - but I think this movie plays homage to some of the classic gangster movies, and so it's all appropriate in that context.",The Outsider

From the settings in buildings in sleazy neighborhoods around post-war Japan to the acting which was excellent. It even had one (maybe more?) moment of humor. There is little to complain about except perhaps it was gory even by today's standards. It's difficult to remember how one things leads to the next as the plot is crafted masterfully. Before the viewer is even aware, a Gaijin (foreigner or outsider) is a part of a Japanese Yakuza family in Osaka. Despite his penchant for violence - sometimes almost senseless - the main character is humanized through a tender side manifested by his love for a woman. The film depicts a broken down Japan still reeling from the impact of World War Two. There appears to be little of the order and wealth so closely associated with contemporary Japan. The movie is an eye opener on Japanese society for those who are unaware of the depths to which Imperial Japan feel after its surrender in 1945.

49,aleksandarsarkic,Yakuza movie for the outsiders,5,21 June 2021,"I am big fan of Japanese cinema and also a fan of Yakuza flicks especially from the 70s decade. Western world was always interested in Japanese culture and also Japanese ""Bad Boys"", Yakuza. Of course my first contact with Japanese underworld was through Black Rain (1989) from Ridley Scott i still found this movie to be interesting and entertraining, after that came in my life probably the best Yakuza flick produced by the west, The Yakuza (1974) from Sydney Pollack starring Robert Mitchum and legendary Ken Takakura which later played in Black Rain, it was recommendation from my father and still i found that movie one of the best if not the best western movie about Japan. Later i started to search for Japanese flcks about organized crime and Yakuza, came movies from Takeshi Kitano, Kinji Fukasaku and Takashi Miike. I heard for The Outsider accidentaly, and ofcourse i was interested to see how again other culture see Japanese one. And i think the name for the movie is great chosen, it is totally for outsiders and for someone who is not knowing so much about Japanese way of life and its customs. It is totally unbelievable that gaijin will enter into Yakuza world so easily, i found it totally impossible to move in organization as a foreigner, but still i gave the movie a chance. The movie itself is solidly directed but if you look more deeper it is total plagiarism of legendary Yakuza movie Battles without honor and humanity. The characters are not well shown, we dont know their motives, their thinking and their goals. Especially the main character played by Jared Leto is shallow and static, it is uninteresting and without any charisma i must say i am not big fan of Leto and his acting is always the same. The big plus of the movie is Japanese part of the cast especially veteran actors like Tadanobu Asano and Kippei Shina. I still dont regret for losing 2 hours, there are some solid moments and someone who enjoy gangster crime movies will find it watchable. My recommendation watch The Yakuza (1974) instead, but if you watched all of this movies give the outsider a chance. My Grade 5/10.",The Outsider
50,MackMonMay87,Stick with a Real Yakuza Movie,5,19 June 2018,"White-Man-in-Japan is practically its own sub-genre of movies (James Coburn's Shogun, Black Rain, The Last Samurai, 47 Ronin, The Wolverine), and all of those movies I mentioned are better movies than The Outsider, which follows the same basic pattern as those movies, but with less interesting acting, set-scenes, characters, and motifs.
If you've never seen a Yakuza movie before, or know nothing about them, this might be a decent introduction, but even then, you might as well stick with the works of ""Beat"" Takeshi Kitano and Takashi Miike, who have a better understanding of the culture and the ideas within. 
Political correctness aside, The Last Samurai is just a more well-made movie that embodies this concept with better action and a story that makes more sense, whether or not the white-visitor who masters-everything storyline is tired out or not. If you're going to do that concept, do a good job with it.
This movie has an underwritten story with a main character that has no backstory, interesting traits, or motive, and is somehow not investigated or extradited back to the US despite being an AWOL soldier in post-WW2 Japan. They dangle a possibly interesting plot-thread with a former member of his unit wondering if he's in Japan to escape a court-martial, and do nothing with it, just like how nothing is done with the good actors, sets, and costumes, which are all fine.

Literally no character development, no real backstory for the protagonist(Leto), the relationships were hard to believe in. The writers were lazy, they did nothing to earn our belief that two of the characters loved each other as brothers, that one would give the other priceless family katana blades... honestly I just wasnt buying it.Lots of very wooden performances. You could've described the entire movie just from seeing a trailer. The Outsider is literally like every other movie about the same subject matter... perhaps even more predictable. If you want to see a solid white guy goes abroad and adopts the culture movie I suggest watching Tom Cruise in The Last Samurai.You're wondering if I actually enjoyed it. I did. I love Japanese culture and the Yakuza are truly interesting and exciting subject matter. I'm also a fan of Jared Leto, although I'm almost positive he's prob a d**k in real life.

53,wgingery,"How do you say ""Blank"" in Japanese?",4,12 March 2018,"'One of the many ways in which the Western has become old-fashioned is that the characters have values, and act on them. Modern action movies like ""The Outsider"" have replaced values with team loyalty; the characters do what they do because they want to win and they want the other side to lose. Underlying most modern action movies is Vince Lombardi's dictum: ""Winning isn't everything; it's the only thing."" Underlying most classic Westerns is the Biblical text: ""What does it profit a man if he gains the whole world, but loses his soul?""' --- film critic Roger Ebert, reviewing the Western ""Open Range"" (2003)Obviously, then, your response to ""The Outsider"" will very much depend on which camp you're in. Are you with the Westerns, or the action movies? The action movie fans will love this film; the Western crowd, not so much. As it happens, I'm with the latter. So. . . .The big problem here is the blank at the center: Nick (Jared Leto) is so undeveloped as a character, I never did figure out what makes him tick. On the outside, he's an accomplished assassin, but how about his soul? What is he like on the inside? What are his values? Why does he do what he does? Not a clue. I finally pulled the plug on him when, without any explanation or justification, he commits one brutal murder too many.....The good news, though, is that it's not Jared Leto's fault. Leto actually turns in a splendid performance. But you have to pay attention. As in silent films, it's all in the eyes,.The other actors also do a good job, especially considering that their parts are just as underwritten as Nick's. Again, it's never explained what he sees in them or they see in him. As for the plot, don't expect any surprises, it rolls on by the numbers; you can play spot the Judas after the first five minutes.Very deliberate pacing: not so slow as to quench my interest entirely, but, then again, it never picked up enough to engage me fully.On the plus side, gritty industrial locations work well with the ice-cold cinematography.

Starring Jared Leto (Dallas Buyers Club), Tadanobu Asano (Mongol: The Rise of Genghis) and Kippei Shina (Outrage).The main positive about this film is its direction, Zandvliet is a fantastic director, he films his films with such control. He also has a keen eye for detail. The acting is really good as well especially from Asano and Shina. Another thing that can't be overlooked is the cinematography and music, both of which add a mundane and dark tone and texture to this film.Sadly, this film isn't perfect. Jared Leto performance is not enough to carry this film. His character isn't very good either, and Leto plays emotionless and stiff.
But worst thing by far is the third act. Everything in the third act seemed rushed, and the once clever film choses to copy other films especially a certain Star Wars film. The way the film ends is shocking as well, I don't want to spoil it for you but a certain character decision near the end is probably the stupidest decision ever made by a character in any film I have ever watched.It is a watchable film with good performances from Asano and Shina, but in my opinion the third act is truly awful.6/10",The Outsider

The movie has superb acting, Leto kills it as a disturbed veteran who has seen way too much. His counterparts within the Yakuza are all equally subtle but fascinating and there's never a moment where it feels forced. The background setting, the design of the 1950's Japan and the cinematography and lighting all add to the great subtle storytelling of the movie.The only thing I would really criticize the movie for is the fact that it isn't a show, because I 100% believe it would have been a stellar 10 episode season. Packed with subtle story, the entire first 10-12 minutes could have been a whole episode. Showing his life in prison more and he gets to know the guy he saved.

It's put in delicate time moment and even more so in circumstances of protagonist's social (even postwar political, incl. a bit racial) position. One should appreciate the authentic setting, with details like music, rituals, etc. Maybe some of you noticed in similar movies on the subject: no colorful shines in the realism, especially not in depicting a (real-life) threat.

The overly translucent narrative doesn't go as deep as to explain what would lend a Marine captain in a Japanese prison in 1956, though.

70,grantonslow,Disappointing,5,31 March 2018,"There was a strong premise here that could have made this movie very interesting. Showing how an Outsider (Westerner) assimilates with Yakuza culture in Japan is not a story line that i'm used to in movies. Despite not being a Leto fan due to Suicide Squad, I gave it a shot.What I found is that Nick's character (Leto) is extremely underdeveloped and ends up coming across as a detached psychopath. It took an enormous amount of time for his backstory to come to light. The backstory itself was very short and uninformative. Basically it takes 90 or so minutes to find out he used to be in the army. However, his reasons for starting the movie in jail are never given. There is very little indication of where Nick came from or what he values. This makes it difficult to take any real interest in his character. Most of the movie felt like it was just him glaring at people trying to be intense. Very little is shown about Japanese culture and I felt that this was really a misrepresentation of how the Yakuza operate.",The Outsider
71,phiup,too far fetched to be believable.,1,11 March 2018,"This movie is unbelievable from every aspect I know. Culturally unbelievable, cinematically unbelievable, story-line is unbelievable.Every good movie lends to it's audience tokens of buy in, critically they call it the, ""suspension of disbelief.""

If the reason they give is too much of a stretch, your suspension of disbelief is broken.
Little buy in's and little rewards lend itself towards a huge buy in and a huge reward. This is why we but in to shawshank redemption and why we don't buy into sharknado.

The performance of Jared Leto its outstanding, and all the Yakuzas too, I guess they were real Yakuzas used in the film.

Did Niander Wallace get his start in a Japanese prison? ""Shut up and watch the movie"", I told myself.The first ten minutes were excellent! Lots of tension; why is this guy in prison, what's his back story, what will happen to this white American who gets involved in a prison situation in post ww2 Japan. Wow, this looks like it might be really good!But, the protagonists motivations are never revealed. He hardly ever speaks. In prison he shows empathy at great risk to himself, which goes completely against the grain of his character for the rest of the film. With a few minor exceptions, he is a violent ruthless murderer who immerses himself in the post ww2 Japanese crime world. There's nothing to like about the character. Nothing.The story arc was weak to say the least. What was the purpose of the journey? Was he disillusioned with America? Who knows? Was this possibly going to be a story about the redemption of an angry broken man who felt betrayed by his nation and what the war did to him mentally? Nope. Half way through, I realized the guy is beyond redemption. He wasn't after redemption, and we are never told why. We are never told what his motivations were or why his story needed to be told in the first place.Just a movie filled with blood and murder and a lot of wasted potential.",The Outsider
79,Madhu-Van-Paare,One of the worst movies,2,18 March 2018,"Sorry to write such a bad review. I understand people work hard on this, and I used to be a fan of Jared Leto (especially Dallas Buyers Club). But after his Joker I started to doubt and now, he needs another movie to turn me around again.
Anyway the main problem with this movie is the plotholes in the story, or rather unrealistic story.
Everything else is good, but to me the story is the main thing. It begins unclear, I did not understand why Jared Leto wants to become a Yakuza. Later it becomes a little more clear, in that he is trying to avoid court marshal. Here are some of the main flaws. Jared Leto is told not to screw around with his Yakuza friend's sister, but he does so anyway. Then his so-called brother does not find out that he is seeing her again, even though they are both in the tattoo parlour (which is also unrealistic for a woman in 1947 Japan to be allowed in there). Then Jared tells him she is pregnant and he receives two amazing swords. In reality her yakuza brother would have killed him, or something like that. Another thing is that the Yakuza boss walks into this open trap, to meet his adversary in a shipyard. Anybody would know that it's a trap. Again not realistic. And this meeting was set up by an 8 year old boy, lol. I could go on, but it would just be a waist of time, just like this movie. Sorry for the folks who worked so hard on this. In short, the acting is amazing, the realism of the sets are amazing, everything is solid except the story.",The Outsider
80,prabhunster,Very interesting story idea but sadly lacks the theatricality to be entertaining.,4,8 April 2018,"Upon reading the tagline for this movie, the idea sounded like a winner, reminiscent of The Last Samurai, a movie which I loved.However, The Outsider lacked one major thing that The Last Samurai achieved, theatricality, that is, the sense of a movie.Consider the differences between reading a great book vs. watching a screen adaptation of that very same story at a movie theatre. With the book, you, the reader, dictate how the story is presented and the feelings that it brings. However, a screen adaption of that same book can't necessarily elicit the same reaction by simply showing the events of the story without emotion behind it. This is the importance of a good director, to fill in the blanks with everything else that we fill in when reading the book:Thematic cinematography/orchestration to capture a setting, directing actors to create compelling personas that we can empathize with, properly adjusting levels of suspense to pace the film so it won't become stagnant, etc, etc. The Outsider unfortunately heavily lacks most of these components. The director may have had a certain vision but it was clearly lost on me.Rather than being presented as a suspenseful, thriller, or epic film, it's directed as a subtle 'matter-of-fact' biographical movie. The story itself is interesting enough but falls short with the director's choice to have the acting stilted/underplayed, leaving the audience apathetic towards the characters. Just to clarify, the acting isn't bad, just purposefully dulled/undersold as part of the director's vision, which was a poor decision IMO, Leto has so much to offer as an actor but his talent isn't allowed to shine in this movie.Continuing the theme of subtlety/minimalism, you'll notice that most scenes in the movie don't have any background music/score, leaving a sort of empty void. I found that to be particularly strange considering that the film isn't dialogue-heavy. As a result, there are a fair amount of silent parts without interesting visuals to compensate. The Verdict: While the director may be talented in his own realm, I think he was clearly the wrong choice for this movie. There is a place for minimalistic direction, but it's not here. Given a different director with a more ambitious vision, this movie could've been better IMHO. This movie may be worth a watch if you're diehard Jared Leto fan, but don't expect any 'Requiem for a Dream' type of performance.4/10***

This is a very well made movie that evokes similar feelings to the last samurai while excelling in not just story but also more modern editing and kinomatrography, acting, lighting, great soundtrack as well as a nice moody atmosphere.
Jared Leto who lets be honest has a tendency to over act is great in the role which calls for more subdued acting.
Is it a perfect movie ? Almost i'd put it right up there with the best crime thrillers and mob dramas.

82,dudemisra,Unique type of film,7,13 November 2019,"It isn't often that I find a Netflix original of authentic quality depicting a place and period not often represented or appreciated in modern times. The Outsider, beyond the integration of an American POW into the Japanese Yakuza, focuses on the national economic and cultural development of post-war Japan.Through this plot, the viewer is able to witness and grasp the bleak and slow transformation of Osaka during the 1950s. The fine details of scenes including the Yakuza gangs walking through the claustrophobic markets displays and connects the viewer with the film, as if we were there in-person.The Outsider is silent chaos. The film spends the majority of its running time switching from pan shots of industrial buildings and Yakuza meetings to Intra-State Violence between different gangs. Its conspicuously aloof, yet it's able to attract us as the film goes on by the minute.

The movie doesn't even spend much time to tell the story of the culture of the Yakuza. It really just feels like things were thrown in.
The Outsider doesn't focus on fancy fight scenes, but it doesn't focus on it's characters much either.
Being a movie that spends time developing a story, I never felt much development. 
The main character suddenly gets higher respects than other Yazuka members for barely any reasons besides helping out a cellmate in prison.
Everything just kind of happens. Things just happen, for reasons unexplained.
I'm not sure what message this movie was trying to portray.
Jared Leto an actor capable of many expressions and feelings and emotion just plays Ryan Gosling from Drive instead.
I'm not saying you can't have a cold and calculating character but he seems to possess no traits besides a strange loyalty to the Yazuka, he offers to skip town on his pregnant girlfriend saying he doesn't know what kind of man he is.

There is a small caveat to his former life but it is so small that it does not answer any questions except that's Leto's character is brutal.

Imho, It is unfair to compare ""The Outsider"" with ""Bright"", the other sombre Netflix's star-studded flick as both are in a genre of its own right. As a ""Yakuza"" movie, ""The Outsider"" storyline remained faithful to the 60' 70's yakuza genre with its typical subject of betrayal and honour, in other words fans of the ""Yakuza Papers Anthology"" won't be disappointed.Suprisingly, there are less dialogue which i find it essential to the storyline as it sets the zen-like mood and calmness throughout the movie. The pacing is so subtle and that one will not flinched at some of the violent scenes. The cast did their part very well although the chemistry between Asano and Leto could have been explored further.

It was disappointing at first, because I was really looking foward to watching it, but since I love oriental/yakuza themed movies and had nothing better to do anyways, I decided to give it a chance.For starters, I enjoyed it a lot! It's not by any means a masterpiece, but it was a very solid movie with good casting and good plot. If you are into the japanese culture as I am, I can guarantee you are going to have a good time as well. Maybe because my expectations were set very low (by the reviews and ratings) I ended up enjoying it more than I thought I would.The acting is very convincing and even though Jared Leto's character doesn't talk much, I believe it was the author intention to give him this blank and mysterious background. The other, japanese, characters are also very well portrayed, but not much development is given into them. The post WW-II Japan's atmosphere is amazing, and it does give you a feeling about the underground yakuza world at the time.For what I think could have been better, the pacing was a bit too slow at times and the story is VERY predictable once you figure out who the bad guy is. It could also have developed a bit better our main protagonist, I understand he's supposed to be mysterious, but almost NOTHING is given to us about his background or anything that could explain why he acts the way he does throught the movie (maybe a sequel exploring it, who knows?).Nonetheless, it was a good movie and I strongly advise you ignore the critics and go watch it for yourself and, hopefully, help spreading the word afterwards too!",The Outsider
102,eksapsy,It's a solid movie,7,26 May 2020,"By no means it is a masterpiece. Not every movie has to be a masterpiece obviously.Advantages:
The protagonist being so bland, sometimes gives an emotion of coldness and chilliness, which makes the viewer perceive the movie in a more educational and broad 3rd perspective rather than being emotional and narrow-minded view. Obviously both have their advantages and disadvantages.Which is what the director wanted the viewer to sense I believe, as the Japanese cinema is not very dramatic often, and usually depicts the scenes in a cold-minded manner. So, if you like the Japanese cinema, you will most likely like this one too.
The post WW2 Japanese ERA is just wonderfuly depicted.Disadvantages:
No exploration into the protagonist's characterThe protagonist (Jared Leto) is rather bland. He mostly shows no emotions. The movie doesn't expose any parts of his past. Obviously, this falls down to how the director and the rest of the team decided for that character to be scripted. But I believe he didn't have to be THAT bland. I barely managed to connect with the protagonist. But since we got nothing of his past, you can't really understand him. That's like the first rule of psychotherapy, to understand someone you must understand his past and we have no clue about him except 1 detail or two.You get more connected with the co-protagonist than with the protagonist himself, at least we get some information about the co-protagonist's feelings and him & his family's past.",The Outsider

In fact, the quoted highlights from paid movie reviewers were completely non-sensical. Too bad I don't speak Japanese, because imo, the only professional movie critic worth hearing from on this movie would have to be Japanese. American critics are too culturally stunted and biased to appreciate what was being depicted in The Outsider.

107,skyjw,Painfully Uninteresting,2,5 April 2021,"There is something borderline amazing about a film exploring this subject matter being as completely uninteresting as this film is.However, I'll begin with the one slight positive I gleaned from this movie so as to not give it just one star: it looks fine. There was no point in this movie which I found to be an eyesore visually and at no point did I spot a boom mic come into frame or some other technical error of that nature.But even with that said, this film is as uninteresting from a visual standpoint as every other facet of its execution. At no point did I find the composition of any one frame of this film to evoke something meaningful or compelling, let alone anything emotional or technically impressive. The fact that the most impressive visual associated with this movie is the poster is a fairly damning problem with this movie. And it never leverages the visual nature of the medium of film to engage in its storytelling, even though I think the director thought he was doing precisely that with some of the longer, more drawn out shots scattered throughout the runtime. As if the notion of longer, slower shots was in and of itself compelling enough on their own.And that idea of the notion of an idea being substantial enough extends to the story as well. Rather than really explore the story of an American imprisoned in postwar Japan and his subsequent involvement in the yakuza, it seems to think the very idea is substantial enough to carry it through 2 hours of meandering scenes in which a total blank slate played by Jared Leto rises up in the world of the yakuza to a degree which is borderline comical if you have any understanding of the yakuza and how they operate. The relationships feel paper thin and important only because the film denotes them as such and what conflicts do arise often feel disconnected from the main character and as a result fail to contribute any meaningful character growth or development. Jared Leto's character fails to even approach the level of Tom Cruise in ""The Last Samurai"" which, while not a groundbreaking performance, was at least one possessing some emotion which conveyed the idea of a ""stranger in a strange land"" and how him building a life in Japan intersected with his personal demons and conflicts. Jared Leto is just an effervescent nothing who serves as little more than an empty husk that can be involved in any number of disconnected scenes leading up to an ending which felt like biting into a rice cracker despite the clear emotional heft the filmmakers thought it would possess.This is a bland, forgettable film so bereft of any passion both in the film itself and its production that I felt I had been robbed of my two hours in a way which very few films have ever managed to evoke.",The Outsider

The trailer hooked me, and in all fairness it did not disappoint. There are a couple of points which if done correctly, would have made it an excellent film. Japanese settings were not greatly utilized and due to the monotone/bleak look of the film and framing of shots, I found myself constantly confused as to where the scene was taking place. Was it his house? No it was her house? No it was a hotel. Those saying Jared Leto's acting is bad, must have been watching another movie... because he does as good a job as anyone could have for the role. It would have been good to see why he was in jail in the beginning (we do find out that he's a US army deserter presumed dead). The opening scene is very confusing, the character of Kiyoshi is seen to be hanged, presumably by a bunch of other prisoners. Were they a rival yakuza gang? Were they trying to help him stage an attempted suicide? It's not really known as we do not see them again.The ending seems to almost leave on a cliffhanger, with Jared Leto's takuza family being pretty much wiped out except for around 5 members. Leto is bowed to and it is presumed that he is now the boss (similar to Michael Corleone at the end of The Godfather). However where the Corleone family is at its strongest at the end of Godfather 1, Leto's yakuza family is almost eradicated at the end of this movie (in fact he is spared by the rival yakuza boss almost out of pity) So the expectation would be to make a part 2 and Chronicle the family's rebuilding. Leaving it as a standalone movie and ending it at this point makes no sense.",The Outsider

I personally loved it with the exception of a few scenes in the first quarter that felt like they were trying too hard to establish an atmosphere.Once it got going though, this is a fantastic movie. Sure we have some of the mob movie cliches, but throwing in Yakusa culture to give this type of movie a whole new spin is great. I take away a point for the atmosphere scenes I mentioned that felt superfluous, otherwise I was entertained throughout and with a great ending, so 9/10.",The Outsider

113,tomjcrisman,You'll either love it or hate it according to the reviews...,8,20 March 2019,"I loved it. Easy to watch and enjoy, but it isn't for everyone. More a 'guy' movie, but with subtitles. Leto plays an overly calm version of Joe Pesci in this film.A lot of unjustified hate for this movie, especially from the critics. I read a review from a critic somewhere that gave it 1 and a half stars, then noted that the same critic gave the recent Ghostbuster's movie 3 out of 4 stars.I think it was panned by critics because the trailer sets it up to be something it isn't. I thought it was going to be a drama rather than a violent romp through 1950s Japan based on the trailer I was forced to watch at least a dozen times by that loveable Netflix trailer autoplay feature. It isn't that at all though. I even began the movie wanting to hate it as much as I hate that Netflix trailer auto-play. I only gave it a chance because it was recommended to me by a friend who said it was worth a look.The movie has great acting and a decent amount of action, you're never bored by the story. Issues with the film are that there are too many gangster movie clichés, the love story is shoe-horned in (though not cringeworthy), and they make a point to have blood spattered across Leto's face through most of the movie, which I felt was a bit over-done.If there is anything really lacking other than some polish, it is more of a look into how Leto's character starts out in prison and what came before. The film would have been stronger with it, but you enjoy the bromance between Leto's character and the member of the Yakuza he meets at the beginning regardless of his back story. As Leto's character in general comes across as a psychopath with PTSD, maybe this was a good decision to keep him likeable as a few scenes implied he wasn't exactly a good person as a soldier.Ultimately, it is more a story about the new yakuza vs the old yakuza as told through Leto's character's perspective.Not a 'must watch', but definitely something you won't regret seeing if you enjoy gangster movies or action movies in general as there are some very satisfying scenes.",The Outsider
114,Mrrogersbestneighbor,Incredibly empty of a movie I had very high hopes with.,1,22 March 2018,"First off, does it deserve 1 star? No. But the baffling amount of 7+ star reviews forced me to give this a 1 to balance it out. The plot itself is what turned me onto the film. However the story has VERY little to do with the plot and instead the movie unfolds like any other movie with typical protagonists who are loyal to each other. With spontaneous jealousy with absolutely no build up thrown in. There is exceptionally little character development or exploration of the ""fish out of water"" type of story you will be expecting watching this. Throughout the entire movie, I kept thinking ""it's bound to get good soon"", but by the end I just found myself laughing and thinking ""That's it? Really? I waited 2 hours for that?""Throughout the movie it was incredibly hard to stay motivated to continue watching it. I kept opening up tabs and opted instead to spend time reading about Japanese tattoo culture, as I found that vastly more interesting than anything the movie presented itself with. It's especially hard to watch a movie that is almost completely absent of a climax or turning point. The acting was great, but the stars weren't left with anything to go off of. And because of how simplistic the story unfolded, it was extremely predictable. Normally, for me at least, that's not as much of a problem if the movie has a lot of thrilling action or suspense in it. I like very thoughtful developed plots and characters as much as anyone, but I also enjoy mindless action movies. Well, there is no thrilling action or suspense, nothing to get your heart rate going up a single beat in a minute. It just comes in very predictable bursts with nothing on the line to provoke a sense of urgency or intensity. Every time you think it might result in something exciting, it goes nowhere and flat lines. Or it results in tragedy, but because it fails to provide you with any real connection to the characters, you don't feel any sense of loss. Especially because the tragedy didn't begin with an intense fight or any potential way the characters could have fought their way out of it. It just... happens. There are no fights in the movie. Just violence or threats of violence from one individual to another, and the other person just receives it without challenge.Instead of spending 2 hours watching this, I would highly recommend browsing Google about the Yakuza tradition of chopping off their own fingers, the aftermath of the atom bombs dropped on Japan, corruption in sumo wrestling and the stigma of tattoos in Japanese culture as that is vastly more entertaining. Even if you have absolutely no interest in those topics, at the very least you'd gain something from it. If you haven't watched many movies in your lifetime at all, or just enjoy atmospheric scenery, you MIGHT enjoy this. As for me, it just left me with a lot of hope but just flat lined and left me feeling deflated and mystified that this has an average rating above 6/10. Perhaps I should've checked the top rated reviews before watching (usually in movies with a 5-7/10 rating, when the top rated reviews are high, I find it at least fairly entertaining. I have yet to enjoy such a movie when the top rated ratings are low. The only exceptions to this are movies based on a book with a huge fan base that I haven't read.).",The Outsider
115,mauricioperilla,Yakuza Godfather,7,14 September 2018,"I wanted to love this movie from the minute I watched the trailer. It had potential. It had an AMAZING cast. I will not go into the story to spoil anything. Under a different director, this could have been a solid 10 on my book. It felt rushed at times, it wanted so hard to be a classic mobster movie like The Godfather or Goodfellas. People usually complain about a long movie, but the 2hr length of this movie was not enough to tell the story the way it should have been told. Emile Hirsch was on screen a total of 4 minutes. What a waste of talent. Leto had very few lines, which was supposed to be a way of showing he was an outsider, but made his character kind of empty at times. Tadanobu Asano was fantastic, but again his talent was wasted. The movie needed to be an hour longer, and to be more violent. I mean, these were the Yakuza, not the boyscouts! It still is a good movie, just not a great movie! Lacked a lot of backstory, and needed more character development. I would still suggest you watch it.

This is 100% a gangster action movie. The silent deadly guy who kills with a stare is a classic trope I never get tired of. Dunno if these people were expecting an art house melodrama, it's got great cinematography but this ain't the Colors trilogy. If you like Drive, GodFather or John Wick, you should definitely give it a shot.",The Outsider
119,ajwh-53593,"Like all outsiders, bit of an oddity",6,9 March 2018,"This should've been great. As a concept, the fish out of water storyline is a tried and tested formula, and the setting within the Yakuza in post-WW2 Japan was potentially an inspired choice. However, it didn't delve anywhere near deep enough into these ideas, and instead remained very much on the outside. Perhaps that was a choice of the filmmakers, but as a storytelling device that only works for the characters, not the audience. We need to be let in on the inside.I was excited about this film because it was picked up a few years ago on the Black List and it seemed to be my kind of story. I don't know if the idea came from Tony Luraschi's 1979 film of the same name about a young American joining the IRA who finds himself out of his depth, but there are many obvious similarities, and not just in the title. The problem with this film though, is that it didn't have the same dramatic conflict or character development. Things just happened and we kind of drifted along with Jared Leto's protagonist, Nick.We didn't get to know anything of Nick's motivation or much of his backstory. That kept it intriguing for awhile, but by the end I didn't care one bit about him. Although the film was stylish and quite atmospheric, it suffered from poor pacing. When there was action, it was bloody and gory and often spontaneous, which can work to good effect, but I didn't find it particularly shocking because there was no build up of tension.The whole film was a bit of a mystery to me. It didn't really use the setting of Japan to good effect, apart from a few cool looking scenes, and kind of skimmed the surface of Japanese culture, which to me at least, as an outsider, is utterly fascinating, and was the film's strongest selling point. Nor did it particularly explore the Yakuza in any great detail. I was really hoping for an updated version of The Yakuza (1974) but was left disappointed.It scores a solid 6/10 because despite its limitations, it's enjoyable enough and it's refreshing to get something a bit different from your usual Hollywood fare. I also thought the cast did a pretty decent job.",The Outsider

A penguin, of course.""The Outsider (2019) directed by Martin Zandvliet is a story following abandoned G.I. Nick Lowell in what amounts to being a bloody exploration of the nuances of fraternity and otherness. Abandoned by the U.S. army after WWII in Japan, Nick helps out yakuza cellmate, Kiyoshi, and finds the favor returned when they leave the prison they were detained in together. Kiyoshi dubs Nick his brother but Kiyoshi's mob family, however grateful, remain skeptical as Nick attempts to change loyalties and adapt to the culture around him as one of only a few white American men. The movie gracefully depicts the beauty and jarring elements of belonging and what it takes to belong somewhere with sharp dark tones contrasted by neon mob highlights, fascinating characters and all around stunning camera work.""To become a Yakuza is a choice.

While some will use the fact that a white guy joins the Yakuza as a member and family member, as a means to spout racist claptrap, I'm guessing those same people think movies like ""47 Ronin"" portray the truth. They've never done any research or study into Japanese history and culture. This movie will keep you deeply rooted in the storyline, more-so if you remember that it's set in post-war Japan, where guns were freely available on the black market, the police had a vested interest in siding with Yakuza mobs and gangs had inalienable rights to operate.

The protagonist, in the first 5 minutes of the movie and out of nowhere and without explanation, joins the Yakuza, does their dirty work, kills eastern guys, western guys, everyone they tell him to, without questioning anything or anyone, keep in mind half an hour ago in the movie he was in a cell cleaning the floor and didn't anyone from the Yakuza he now belongs to and is so devoted to.There is this particular laughable part where someone is holding a gun at him and he takes it off his hand. This part is particularly badly acted and comical.He also has this deep tone in his voice (like Christian Bale when being Batman) which I also didn't understand and was pretty comical.Overall a bad movie, you'd be better not to watch it.As a sidenote:

A White man is in jail for a reason we never find out about in post world war 2 Japan. He gets released sometime in the 1950's. He finds himself involved with organized crime and a turf war. We watch as this movie slowly unfolds and the plot further develops. The acting is superb. The directing, cinematography, special effects, music, are all excellent.

It looked beautiful, the soundtrack was clean and effective. Even if some of the cars were a few years older than 54, production realities are what they are.Yes, more development of Leto's character Nick, could have made him more dynamic, but often, less character development is used in the genre to elicit mystery.

151,christurley-75161,Before you write this off... WATCH IT!,10,10 March 2018,"Imagine... You enjoy independent cinema... You are trying to rid of your ideleness, by seeing something fresh and exciting, yet it combines themes from other films involving organized crime. We all feel like outsiders at times. We all are just maybe looking for swim against the current, yet knowing when to flow with it - As Leto's character, Nick, in this film suggests to the very gorgeous Shioli Kutsuna. There won't be spoilers in this review, that last part I cited is found in the trailer.I have been debating tirelessly on Twitter against Asian critics of this film. They dismiss it, before it was released as, ""Whitewashing;"" ""Offensive;"" ""Westernizing;"" amongst many phrases that are slanderous. It is impossible to know the intent of Jared Leto, for taking the role and executive producing. It is not possible to understand the mindset of Martin Zandvliet (Director), or the screenplay writer Andrew Baldwin, behind making this film. Is this a perfect film? Or course not! It is not trying to be! Is there sexy style? Yes. Is there a cool plot? Definitely. Is it worth watching? Absolutely. I think this is one of the best 2018 has yet to offer and just like Leto's work in Blade Runner 2049, it'll forever be underappreciated. All thanks to the big baby critics (Not all Asian), but the others who before even witnessing this great film - wrote it off as something that it's not. If this film was making an attempt to have a hot shot Hollywood guy (Jared Leto is anything but, the guy is the lead singer of 30 Seconds to Mars and has proven to be a HARD worker as an actor) just be propped by Asian extras in a Japanese culture to make Asian culture more palatable, would the film be named, ""The Outsider,"" or as they call him (You may remember from Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift - nobody accused this of white washing, hmm wonder why?) ""Geijin,"" which is Japanese for, ""Outsider."" I am baffled by everyone's uproars to a perfectly harmless picture. Japan is behind China, but with South Korea shares the spotlight of having a top-ten rating in terms of revenue generated in cinema, where are the naysayers to be found in those films? But they go out of their way to bash this before it's even released! I find that to be more offensive than a guy who is white joining the Yakuza.This movie is wrongly being bashed for everything that has nothing to do with the movie. How I worded that may be confusing, but I mean every syllable - read it slowly. The soundtrack, cinematography, the ode to John Wick nature this film has makes films like, ""The Last Samurai,"" look as cheap as the title suggests. This film was mishandled by its producers in my opinion and Leto could be one of them; however, how responsible they are for marketing is above my pay grade. I can tell you, if you see this movie for yourself - you should be thinking, ""If a black or Mexican guy were to be cast instead of Leto, would we be having the same reviews shown to us?"" I am in no way being dismissive of racial inequality, it is present and I admire any Asian critic who wishes to voice their opinion, but from my vantage point; I believe their using the wrong film to do so with. This story is probably unrealistic; however, there is something profound about it. There is true magnanimity in Leto's character. Assisting Japanese thugs to the point of him becoming trusted and loved. If ever in your dull and idle life finding yourself feeling like an outsider - this is your movie. I give it an A - because again, it is not perfect. The moments of violence seem all too convenient; however, this does take place after WWII. Enjoy it, believe me; I have seen awful movies - this is not one of them.",The Outsider

155,theins-83871,Interesting concept but a disappointment in the end.,3,14 March 2018,"I came away with two thoughts about this film. (1) As at least one other reviewer has commented -- the character Leto plays is pretty much a complete blank. I won't criticize Leto's performance -- he didn't write the script and perhaps he wasn't the director. However the end effect is that his character ""Nick"" could have been a robot. This is the main reason for my 3-star rating. (2) I found the story-telling in this movie very ""spare"" (along with the visuals - sets, colors, costumes.) I came away with the sense that this was a foreign film, i.e., not a Hollywood production; just in the way it looked. That's not a criticism.",The Outsider

Great locations, actors, cinematic mood coloring, and music. As others have already said.. ignore critics ratings... they live in another world... reviewing films using ridiculous self-imposed standards. Maybe they should get real jobs... now there's an idea!",The Outsider
163,pretty_hate99,A bit slow but a solid effort,7,13 March 2018,"The Outsider is yet another case of critics and social media ruining a movie before it even premiered. In addition to claims that the casting of Jared Leto was another case of Hollywood whitewashing (which it wasn't), early reviews dropping from critics claiming it was going to be the worst movie on Netflix in 2018 and such kind of tainted the movie before anyone else got to see it. Well, let me tell you not only is the movie not a case of whitewashing, it is actually quite enjoyable.The premise alone of an American ex-prisoner of war joining one of the most notorious gangs in the world should be enough to interest you. Throw in an Oscar-winner and you should ideally have a recipe for something good. 
Now, with that said, I will admit that a majority of the movie is a bit slow. Until the last half hour, there isn't a whole lot that happens to make you jump out of your seat. However, you have to remind yourself that The Outsider is a crime-thriller. It is centralized around a Japanese gang and typically movies centralized around gangs tend to have a bit of a slow burn. That is definitely the case with The Outsider. Once you get to the climax of the story, it really picks up. Aside from being a bit slow throughout, I would criticize that the end is a bit abrupt. You don't get much resolution from the climax, but it is still enough to wrap things up. For those mostly curious about Jared Leto's part in this movie, I must admit that there isn't a whole lot of dialogue from the film's main character, Nick Lowell. He is a bit too mysterious for his own good and his backstory is practically non-existent, but Leto's portrayal of him is spot on. Just because people didn't like Suicide Squad doesn't give a never-ending excuse to trash anything that Jared Leto touches. His acting is just fine and I think any complaints about the character being dry or mysterious should be directed at the screenwriters or the director. Sometimes it's just the way characters are written and as an actor, you have to go with it. Overall, I would give The Outsider 7/10. It's certainly not the best movie you can find on Netflix or about the Yakuza, but it is far from the worst. The critic reviews are a lot more harsh than was necessary. If you like gangster movies or Japanese culture in general, you'll enjoy this one.",The Outsider

165,SeanBurchette,Great story told poorly,4,13 June 2019,"Start to end the movie is missing something. It so badly needs a backstory for the main character or more info on the Yakuza families and them fighting to explain the start of the movie. From the get go you are trying to figure out exactly what is going on and it doesn't ever seem to be answered. I wish it also spent more time on the culture and customs, everything seem rushed. Maybe they did this as a point of view of Jared Leto character Nick.I enjoy Mob/Gangster movies so I was excited to see on on the Yakuza, and post WWII setting made it all so more interesting. The acting is very well done, some times the subtitles seem to be a little to quick to read. I wish you saw more of the gritty underworld and more action.Went bothered me the most is the massive cliff hanger at the end.

There is not one inch of credible emotion coming out of them. The script and dialogues were written by a child. The fillings in between actions scenes are disturbing and cringe.

179,sighcoe,2 Hrs is not enough,9,10 March 2018,"I have no idea how critics scores their movie (to think movies like Twilight and the likes get to have a high rating), I have no idea what are their standard to give specific ratings on movies and series, but I have a different opinion because I just try to enjoy a movie especially wjen it fits the bill - through summar and genre - Im looking at, not finding fault in everything. 
There are reviewers saying Jareds facial expression never changes... Hmmm I wonder if they really understand the character the actor was trying to portray or... They just want to nit pick something that is not worth nit picking about. The character Nick was supposed to have that indifferent expression just so no one could read or understand what he's thinking or what's going on in his mind. I actually love his blandness, it gave an aditional mystery to his character. 
The story itself is kinda like a prologue of the real core the movie should be. (Spoiler) When the rest of his Yakuza brother bow down to him in reverance of him getting the killer that kills their boss. I think it has something to do with how you will get into a position if the BOSS has no bloodline relative that would take the position, do correct me if Im wrong. But thats what I understand to most of the Yakuza stories Ive read. 
The development of the story is quite dragging as some complains, yes, but that was the point of the story. In fact, the story should be serialized just so Nick the character could be more understood and we get to see him develop into a character that's worth sharing a sake with the old man Boss. 
At the end of the story, I was hoping there was an episode 2 or something because that was were the story should begin. It was the point of the story where the 'real' plot should move, but I guess thats just me.
Crime stories especially like this one gets into me, suspenful and with a depth. Of course its not as good as The Godfather, because I guess the screen time was too short to flesh out what should be an epic Asian Gangster story. It was rushed in a sense that it wanted to explain everything but couldnt in just a short amount of time. 
Im giving this movie 9/10 just because I feel theres something missing on it, yet the ending did make me crave for more.",The Outsider

But, on the other I found the lack of insight into the character mysterious and compelling.There's a nice gritty (4K Gritty) feel to the movie it's not the usual gangster glamourising rubbish and it feels believable. I got the feeling throughout that all is not champagne and roses in the criminal underworld which some movies tend to try and portray.I for one really enjoyed this movie. Leto has redeemed himself, for me anyway, and I believe he really suited the role.

The story is centered around their life as a family in the criminal underworld in post WWII, the gaijin tries to blend in but never really accomplishes it. He is not crucial for the story at all, more like a side note, which makes the movie pretty interesting and me questioning if I have seen the same one like some of the critics have.

When he got shot in the leg I felt absolutely nothing, just wished they had finished the job. The love story was so underdeveloped as to be laughable - there's a woman, so naturally she and the protagonist will fall in love even though there's zero build-up or reasons why they would fall for each other apart from both being attractive.
