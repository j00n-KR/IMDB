0,MartinHafer,A strange but endearing little film,8,1 June 2007,"This interesting little film is set in a small town in France in 1960. Into a very conservative and self-satisfied town comes a strange Bohemian lady and her young daughter to open a chocolate shop. The fact that the child has no father and the shop opens during Lent sends some of the townspeople into a tizzy--particularly the Mayor who is like a human version of Sam the Eagle from the ""Muppet Show""--both in looks and attitude. Despite the concerted efforts of many to drive her out of business, the lady's business survives--thanks to candy that seems to work magic on those who consume it. Later, a group of Gypsies arrive and for once, they are the most hated residents of the town--not the Chocolatier. How all this anger and animosity is worked out is something you'll just need to see for yourself.Now some might watch this film and assume it is an attack on religion--it sure looks that way through much of the film. On one hand, you have the Chocatier who is good and never goes to church and on the other you have church goers who are all hypocrites. However, please DON'T give up on the film, as you later see that the lady does NOT have all the answers and the film is not an attack on religion, per se, but an attack on those who have a dogmatic devotion to rules and thereby ignore the spirit of Christianity. In many ways the film reminds me of ANTONIA (Best Foreign Picture Winner, 1995) except that unlike ANTONIA, this film is NOT meant as an angry attack on religion and seems less rabidly feminist. Both films actually have a very similar message, but CHOCOLAT is much more subtle and less angry--meaning it's a film that can be appreciated by most anyone regardless of their political or religious persuasion--especially since the film seems to call for religious reform not the elimination of religion altogether.Also, oddly, the film reminded me quite a bit of another Dutch film, JA ZUSTER, NEE ZUSTER (Yes Sister, No Sister). Both feature a nice leading lady and her small group of friends who are constantly attacked by a very conservative and fun-hating neighbor who eventually comes to accept them in the end.About the only serious negative in the film is Johnny Depp's character. He looks scruffy--just like Depp looks in real life. Considering this film was set in 1960, he really is an anachronism--being a 21st century hippie-like character plopped down in the early 1960s. His character just didn't make a lot of sense.Regardless, this is a fun and highly entertaining film. Aside from a couple tiny scenes that make the film inappropriate for young kids, this is a film you can let your kids see (making it quite unlike ANTONIA).",Chocolat
1,TheLittleSongbird,A truly delicious experience- almost like the equivalent of putting a chocolate into your mouth,9,27 October 2010,"There were a few reasons why I wanted to see Chocolat. I am all for sweet, heart-warming stories and I love Johnny Depp and Judi Dench. Upon viewing, Chocolat doesn't disappoint. The pacing sags slightly in the middle, but Chocolat is overall delightful and quite simply for me a delicious experience. The production values are exquisite- the cinematography is lovely, the scenery is breathtaking and the costumes are gorgeous. The music is also lovingly lyrical, and the script is both funny and touching and thankfully manages not to become too mushy or treacly. And the story is very heart-warming and compelling, with crisp direction from Lasse Hallstrom. Chocolat does also have a fine cast, Juliette Binoche is typically fine and Johnny Depp looking so handsome by the way is charming. Alfred Molina is great too, and while Judi Dench was very good I personally think her performances for Notes on a Scandal, Iris and Mrs Brown were better. In conclusion, excellent film. 9/10 Bethany Cox",Chocolat
2,Leofwine_draca,Didn't warm to it,3,14 September 2021,"Not a film I could warm to; I found it trite and cliched throughout. What I did like was the genuine French atmosphere and feel although I think AMELIE did a lot better in this respect. Worst of all was Johnny Depp, who I felt to be slimy here.",Chocolat
3,SnoopyStyle,Lyrical chocolate eroticism,6,14 February 2014,"Vianne Rocher (Juliette Binoche) and her young daughter move to a rural conservative French town and open a chocolate shop. The town is run by the mayor Comte de Reynaud (Alfred Molina) who is a traditionalist. He is not amused by Vianne's life and her ideas. They start to fight for the soul of the town. Then a band of gypsies comes to town with the sexy Roux (Johnny Depp).It's a slow moving story. It has its charms, and Juliette Binoche is as lovely as ever. The actors are all great. Although Lena Olin is miscast as an abused wife. The role needs a more mousy actor. Lena is way too powerful for the role.The movie is a sort of talky lyrical erotic fable, and it starts with the glow that Binoche gives off. The comedy is fleeting. The battle between Reynaud and Rocher doesn't have the needed tension. It does have heart. But the pacing is slow for a two hours movie. Johnny Depp is a cool river traveling musician, and comes in a little too late in the movie. When he comes in after almost half of the movie over, he mostly distracts. Overall, this movie is a little too slow for my taste.",Chocolat
4,lee_eisenberg,Your mouth will water.,10,14 August 2005,"I actually was rooting for ""Chocolat"" to win Best Picture for 2000. If you're the type who easily gives in to temptation, then this is the movie for you. Vianne Rocher (Juliette Binoche) and her daughter open a chocolate shop in a small French town where the mayor has suppressed all forms of happiness. But once Vianne and her daughter start selling their chocolates, things start to change for the better. And some people in town don't like that.""Chocolat"" reminded me of ""To Wong Foo, Thanks for Everything, Julie Newmar""...in a good way. The idea of an outsider coming in and upsetting the status quo always makes a good movie. This is a movie that neither your eyes, mouth or stomach can afford to miss.",Chocolat
5,jboothmillard,Chocolat,7,19 April 2006,"From director Lasse Hallströmof (The Cider House Rules), this is a pretty good film of how a delicious substance can change a town in both good and bad ways. Basically, in a French village (which explains the title being French) run by the mayor, Comte Paul De Reynaud (Spider-Man 2's Alfred Molina) a new woman moves to the town. Soon enough, Vianne Rocher (Oscar, BAFTA and Golden Globe nominated Juliette Binoche) and her daughter Anouk open a chocolate shop. The only concern for some people is that she has opened during rent, but she still insists on letting people try her new recipes and treats. Unfortunately, not everyone approves, especially the mayor who tries to make everyone turn against Vianne. Also starring Memento's Carrie-Anne Moss as Caroline Clairmont, Oscar, BAFTA and Golden Globe nominated Dame Judi Dench as Armande Voizin, Johnny Depp as Roux and BAFTA nominated Lena Olin as Josephine Muscat. It was nominated the Oscars for Best Music, Original Score for Rachel Portman, Best Writing, Screenplay Based on Material Previously Produced or Published and Best Picture, it was nominated the BAFTAs for Best Cinematography, Best Costume Design, Best Make Up/Hair, Best Production Design and Best Adapted Screenplay, and it was nominated Golden Globe Best Motion Picture - Comedy/Musical and Best Original Score. Juliette Binoche was number 88, and Johnny Depp number 22 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, Dame Judi Dench was number 1 on The 50 Greatest British Actresses, she was number 1 on Britain's Finest Actresses, Depp was number 9 on The 100 Greatest Sex Symbols, and Dench was number 8, and Depp number 2 on The World's Greatest Actor.

6,ccthemovieman-1,Sour Agenda Coverered In Sweet Chocolate,2,13 December 2007,"It didn't take long to see the obvious in here: nice cinematography, attractive cast and an unbelievable ""propaganda piece"" - one of the worst I have ever seen, and I've seen many. Folks, this was not really about ""chocolate."" That was just a cover-up for the cultural agenda advanced by the screen writers.Here are just some of the things in the film (facts not opinion):All the Catholics in this small French town are shown to be pious which translates to filmmakers - as portrayed in this movie - as ""narrow-minded, stuffy, puritanical, nasty, almost illiterate, etc. The mayor i pictured eve more so, as some kind of reactionary. The young priest, of course, is a big villain, too. According to the screenplay here, what's the remedy for this town full of these religious people? A Liberal woman who would never be stoop to attending church with these nasties, so, of course, this poor little liberated thinker is under attack from these right wingers for producing ""sinful"" chocolate in a cute little shoppe....and during Lent, too! This left wing cook is under attack from priests, the mayor, religious citizens - all portrayed as ""bad"" people. You have to almost see this to believe it, it's so exaggerated and ludicrous.The movie doesn't offer much in the way of subtleties, in this regard. Too bad, because they did effectively coat this propaganda piece with nice cinematography and made all the chocolate look so good you could almost taste it. I wonder how many people went out and bought some after viewing this film?",Chocolat
7,Quinoa1984,"Makes mouths happy, chocolate or no chocolate",7,26 January 2001,"Chocolat, the new light dramedy from the director of Cider House Rules, doesn't match up to it, but it is sweet even if it is too light at times. Here, Juliet Binoche plays a free spirit inside of a chocolatier and stirs up a town with her precense that goes against the town's lifestyle.  It has some flaws, but overall it is pretty nice for a good time.  Johnny Depp gets top billing but is hardly in half of the movie.  B+",Chocolat
8,evanston_dad,Sickening Even for Chocolate Lovers,5,12 July 2010,"Art house lite with consistently uninteresting director Lasse Hallstrom.""Chocolat"" is a painlessly mediocre movie that uses a handful of actors with accents and a foreign setting to make people who aren't comfortable with truly art house or foreign films feel like they're experiencing something original and beyond the mainstream. But this is really pretty maudlin, saccharine and obvious stuff.The film managed to scrape together five Oscar nominations, the most ridiculous of them for Best Picture, but the Best Actress/Supporting Actress nominations for Juliette Binoche and Judi Dench equally undeserved. Not because these two women aren't gifted actresses, mind, but because nothing about this film is Oscar worthy.Grade: C",Chocolat
9,anaconda-40658,Sweet!,7,19 March 2016,"Chocolat (2000): Dir: Lasse Hallestrom / Cast: Juliette Binoche, Judi Dench, Lena Olin, Alfred Molina, Johnny Depp: Magical film symbolizing sinful desires associated with chocolate. A woman and her daughter travel from town to town opening up chocolate shops and invite bystanders to lavishes the taste. Why her chocolates have romantic affects on people is unexplained but the film is visually crafted. Directed by Lasse Hallestrom with disjointed structure and full of clichés but it is a big improvement over the overrated snore fest The Cider House Rules. Despite the lack of background and explanation Juliette Binoche is sunny and pleasant. Judi Dench steals scenes as an elderly woman with diabetes who is smitten by her daughter due to her lifestyle. Lena Olin plays the victim of spousal abuse who finds refuge in the company of this mysterious woman. Alfred Molina debates against Binoche, which leads to conviction when he wakes up in the wrong place at the right time. Johnny Depp is featured as a drifter who gets romantically involved with Binoche, but his role and this subplot is utterly pointless and distracting. None of the subplots are solid due to bad structuring but the cast play off the fantasy level to great payoff. It contains elements of romance but in conjunction with tremendous visual fantasy in appearance. Theme regards acceptance that is as inviting as chocolate to taste buds. Score: 7 ½ / 10",Chocolat
10,HotToastyRag,A Valentine's tradition,10,15 February 2021,"One year when I was in high school, I hosted a Galentine's dinner (before it was called Galentine's) for all my single girlfriends. My mom cooked us an elegant dinner, and all the girls whipped out their cameras (before it was cool to photograph your food) and took pictures. She made us five different desserts, including brownies, chocolate cheesecake, and chocolate-chip cookies, and we gorged ourselves while watching Chocolat. Ever since then, it's been a tradition to watch Chocolat on Valentine's Day. I've seen it twenty times by now, and every time I still love it and get even more out of it.An interesting story or a memorable performance can make a good movie, but I always say the supporting cast makes a great movie. The story of a nomad coming to a traditional, religious French village and opening a chocolaterie right before Lent is interesting. Juliette Binoche's layered, incredibly subtle performance is inspiring. She knows herself and doesn't let anyone hurt her feelings or make her feel small. But being different is hard, and she struggles to stay true to herself even while she helps others. She never forces anyone out of their comfort zones. She's merely a mirror they can choose to look at if they want to. Through her, they can see where improvement is needed. Through her, they find a safe place to grow.As fantastic as Juliette's performance is, the supporting cast in this movie is the icing on the cake - or, the chocolate shavings on the truffle. Judi Dench is the crusty landlady who rents Juliette the chocolate shop. She starts the movie disappointed and despondent, but one sip of Juliette's hot chocolate returns her spunk and enjoyment. Lena Olin practically steals the show, truly embodying a woman who's stayed in a physically abusive marriage for years. Through Juliette's encouragement, she blossoms and realizes there are other options besides letting her husband, Peter Stormare beat her and destroy her spirit. John Wood adores his elderly dog and harbors a crush on the elegant Leslie Caron (who looks exactly the same as she did in Gigi!), and manages to stump the new, impressionable priest, Hugh O'Connor, during his dilemma at confessional. The beautiful Carrie-Anne Moss has a three-pronged dilemma: she's overprotective of her son's health, she's in love with her married boss, and she doesn't get along with her reckless mother. And finally: Alfred Molina. He's a wonderful villain, believing in what he knows to be right so completely you're practically on his side. He loves his town, he loves God, and he loves his principles. He turns the arrival of the new proprietress into a battle of good and evil, symbolic on every level. Without his performance, the rest of the movie doesn't matter.Now, onto Robert Nelson Jacob's screenplay adaptation: Joanne Harris's original novel was a light and fluffy piece featuring the now-popular magical realism theme. Vianne weaves a little magic into her chocolate creations and is able to make her customer's lives better. In the movie, of course, she uses her intuition and friendship instead of magic. But are you ready for this? The Count de Reynaud isn't in the book at all! His character is the driving force of the film; without him there simply isn't a story. And the book, in fact, doesn't have a story. It's merely a woman who opens a chocolaterie and gives people magical chocolates. Jacobs's screenplay is so powerful, every word, every gesture is meaningful. Do you know what you're watching next Valentine's Day? I do!",Chocolat
11,Sylviastel,Choco-Boring Not!,8,30 May 2007,"Okay, the film has a first rate cast including the wonderful Oscar Winner Juliette Binoche who plays a single mother who comes to a small village in La Belle France where the rules are governed by a small-minded mayor. Anyway, Lena Olin plays a battered wife who is taken in by Binoche's character. Dame Judi Dench plays a 70 year old widow full of life and she earns an academy award nomination no matter what she does in the film industry. Anyway, British Alfred Molina plays the French mayor. Scandinavian Lena Olin plays a key role as well. American Johnny Dep plays a rogue pirate who he and his gang of vagabonds wash up on the riverbanks and entice Binoche's character. The film is alright and somewhat above average. OF course, some of it at times can be absurd. My favorite moment is the housewife who remarks about her husband's lack of interest in intimacy and she was played by a French actress as well. The film is done well by Lasse Hallstrom but I don't think it's Oscar worthy. American Carrie Anne Moss also has a role playing Dench's daughter who forbids her son from knowing his grandmother. You can figure what happens.",Chocolat

13,JamesHitchcock,New Age Paganism in the Age of Louis XXIII,4,24 April 2006,"The British have typically viewed the French as a progressive nation, radical in their politics, sceptical about religion and liberal in their attitude towards sexuality. This stereotype perhaps owes more to the Left Bank intelligentsia of Paris than it does to ""la France Profonde"", and ""Chocolat"" sets out to overturn it with a vengeance. The film is set in the year 1959 in a small French town that is conservative to the point of absurdity. Local affairs are dominated by a reactionary aristocrat, the Comte de Reynaud, who serves as the mayor. Virtually the entire population are pious, churchgoing Catholics, subscribing to a narrow, puritanical interpretation of that faith. (And this in the land of Diderot and Voltaire!) At times I wondered if the film were set not in our universe but in an alternative one where the French Revolution never happened and the country remained a feudal, theocratic monarchy into the second half of the twentieth century under the benevolent rule of King Louis XXIII.Into this bastion of ultra-conservatism breezes a young woman named Vianne Rocher. Vianne does a number of things to upset many of her new neighbours, especially the Comte. She is a freethinker who refuses to attend Mass. She is an unmarried mother with an illegitimate daughter. She befriends a tribe of water-borne gypsies known as the ""river rats"" who are deeply unpopular with the rest of the community and even becomes romantically attached to their leader, Roux. Worst of all, she opens a shop selling chocolate. This last would not normally be regarded as a major crime, especially in France, a nation who are said to live to eat whereas the British merely eat to live. In this town, however, chocolate is regarded as a sinful temptation from the devil, especially as Vianne has the temerity to open shop during the sacred fast of Lent.Vianne soon finds herself under attack, particularly from the Comte and the local priest, Pere Henri, but she also has her supporters and loyal customers, and soon strange things begin to happen in the town. An elderly couple declare their love for one another. Josephine, a battered wife, learns to stand up to her abusive husband. A put-upon old woman, Armande, learns to stand up to her overbearing daughter. The townspeople become more tolerant and accepting of the river rats, and even the Comte's heart starts to soften. The suggestion is that it is Vianne's delicious chocolate that is, in some mysterious way, responsible for all these changes.The idea that a chocolate shop could magically be responsible for such a thoroughgoing transformation of a whole town is, of course, a preposterous one, but this is not a realistic film to be interpreted literally. It is rather a fable that invites interpretation on a symbolic level. The trouble with the film as far as I was concerned is that its symbolism rests upon some highly questionable assumptions. Its predominant tone is one of prejudice against organised religion, particularly Catholicism. The Catholic Church is equated with all that is joyless, life-denying and bigoted. Pere Henri is a weak and spineless young man, who lets the Comte write his sermons for him. When Henri finally acquires a backbone and finds the courage to defy the Comte he preaches a sermon urging his congregation to forget about the divinity of Christ and to concentrate instead on His humanity. While some of us, myself included, would welcome a Christianity that focuses on Christ's humanity, this is not the traditional teaching of the Catholic Church, which has always insisted (as have the mainstream Protestant denominations) that Christ is both human and divine.Yet, although the townspeople call Vianne an ""atheist"" for her refusal to attend Mass, this is not a film that promotes atheism, if by that term is meant a strict scientific rationalism. Nor, despite Henri's apparent conversion to the tenets of that faith, does it consciously attempt to promote Unitarianism. Rather, the prevailing ethos seems to be that of Hollywood's favourite religion, a misty and sentimental New Age paganism. The film suggests that there is something both mysterious and spiritual about Vianne, said to have been blown into town ""by the North wind"". She is revealed to be descended from a tribe of Central American nomads (although Juliette Binoche's features do not really suggest such an exotic ancestry). Her daughter Anouk is in mystic communion with an invisible kangaroo named Pantoufle. Both of them wear red hoods and cloaks, which may not have any definite symbolic meaning but which gives them the air of fairy-tale characters.Vianne's shop can, in fact, be seen as the centre of an alternative religion, with her as its priestess. This religion has its own sacrament (eating chocolate), its converts, and even its own martyr when Armande, who turns out to be a diabetic, kills herself with an overdose of chocolate. Above all, it has its Two Commandments, ""Be tolerant of your neighbour"" and ""Self-indulgence is better than abstinence"". While the first is unexceptionable, the second is based on a misconception. Whereas self-denial may not in itself make a person a saint (although religious believers may find the self-discipline involved spiritually beneficial), neither does indulgence, whether sexual or gastronomic. It is quite wrong to imply that asceticism is automatically linked to narrow-mindedness, joylessness or bigotry. Think, for example, of Saint Francis or Mahatma Gandhi. The film sets out to be an anti-Catholic satire, but fails to understand the spiritual tradition it is satirising. (And I write that as a non-Catholic).Despite some star names in the cast, the acting is not particularly distinguished. The film's best feature is some attractive, if at times cloyingly so, photography of the French countryside, but this is not enough to save it. The film's central metaphor is perhaps appropriate in a way that was not intended. Too much chocolate can make you sick. And this is definitely too much. 4/10",Chocolat
14,Smells_Like_Cheese,"If chocolate is considered to be evil... then... oh, boy",8,29 May 2004,"I need some churching. ""Chocolat"" is a cute little town film. All about a woman who newly arrives into town and makes chocolate. When she turns down an invitation to church, everyone thinks bad things about her. They even consider her chocolate to be evil because it tastes so good. She befriends most of the townspeople. Excluding a few who don't like her at all. She even befriends the ""rats"" who sail in once a year. She happens to fall for one of them. But she is still pressured to leave due to her delicious chocolate.
The film is well done. The story is alright. But the acting takes it all. I would recommend especially for Johnny lovers.8/10",Chocolat

It is a film you either love or hate depending upon your point of view. The humor in the film is rather understated.The biggest problem the film has is it starts ponderously slow developing it's story. It doesn't sharply develop it's conflict between the town & the new arrival opening a Chocolat store during Lent. It does everything kind of through a rumor mill type of logic.Judi Dench & Johnny Depp breath life into this film when they are in it. Without them, the whole film would not go.

18,KineticSeoul,I was craving chocolates after seeing this flick that is for sure,6,25 February 2013,"This is basically one of those movies where someone comes into contact with a group of people and changes their lives. Except chocolates involved this time around. And goes in a fairytale like direction. Although it's a very predictable movie it has that warm and sweet sensation to it. Yeah, Johnny Depp is in this movie but he isn't even in half of the flick. And just there as a love interest and a character to bring out more of the human side to the main protagonist. Johnny basically plays somewhat of a pirate in this before ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" flicks he stars in. And he plays a friendly, romantic pirate like someone like that exist. But this movie will be mainly known for having Johnny Depp in it. There is also quite a bit of religious prospects in this movie. And deals with judgmental and narrow minded people in a small village. Run by a very judgmental and narrow minded mayor. And the small village people exist but isn't really living. And a woman comes to that village with her daughter and changes that. And the woman is a expert when it comes to making chocolates and a good cook as well. And her talents changes the village.

19,sddavis63,"Worth A Watch, But Nothing Spectacular",6,16 November 2002,"There's something about this movie that just didn't quite work for me, but I'm having trouble putting my finger on exactly what it was. For the most part it's a pleasant enough diversion, told almost as a fairy tale, about a small town in France locked in time, where nothing ever changes and where the local Mayor (the Comte de Reynaud played by Alfred Molina) holds sway over everyone and everything - including the local parish priest - and whose personal views of morality are imposed in an almost totalitarian fashion. The routineness of the town is shattered when a mysterious woman (Juliette Binoche) is carried in on a north wind, as the narrator tells us, and opens a chocolate store, which slowly releases the passion for self-indulgence of everyone in the town.Molina put on a superb performance as the Mayor, and Binoche was also very good as Vianne, the chocolate shop owner, although I thought her performance came across as surprisingly low key, considering she played the leading role. Also noteworthy was Hugh O'Conor as the hapless parish priest, completely under the thumb of Reynaud, who has to proofread and approve every sermon he writes.Somehow, though, this just never really grabbed hold of me. I didn't think it was bad. Quite the contrary. It was - as I said - a very pleasant movie to watch. It becomes somewhat darker in the last half hour or so, which was appropriate, and ultimately leads up to the parish priest offering us a sermon about acceptance. To be honest, though, I felt almost as if I were watching a remake of ""Pleasantville"" relocated to France. (You know: a little bit of colour being injected into a dull and dreary existence.)It's OK, worth a watch, but it didn't get me greatly enthused.6/10",Chocolat
20,ElMaruecan82,"The only way to get rid of a temptation is to yield to it , said the poet ...",8,21 October 2013,"Is it? In fact, more than the film's characterizing food, Lasse Hallström's ""Chocolat"" symbolizes these little pleasures and delights that, once you taste them, make you inevitably wonder if it's worth troubling over the mightier matters of life especially when it's governed by the rigid hand of morality, when succumbing to the temptation or luring people into it, become a difficult, even perilous, mission.""Chocolat"" is set in a French village with an unmemorable name, one of these 'once upon a time' old-fashioned little places, whose people live according to tacit rules and codes that remained unperturbed for centuries. It's a village à la Frank Capra with a mayor, a priest, a grouchy lady, an old mourning widow, a lonely man walking across the street with his dog, a mad woman who hides a concealed wound in her heart, and so one and so forth. And the village's austere and apparently sinister stagnancy only calls for a stranger to break the morbid routine. Her name is Vianne Rocher, and the village, naturally, will never be the same after her arrival.I wonder how the producers were convinced to make a film that exploits so many of the usual archetypes that nourished our classic knowledge, in a world that got so eagerly sucked into the progresses of technology, action and fast-paced thrillers. Indeed, when fairytale and sentimentality mostly belong to animation, ""Chocolat""'s presence feels as awkward as Vianne's in the village. They probably thought that it's today's very audience that would need that kind of nostalgic escapism or that the film would never fail to touch the hearts, because the heroine is portrayed by Juliette Binoche. And yes, as Vianne Rocher, Binoche is the secret ingredient that gives the film its delicious flavor.Only Binoche could carry the perfect mixture of alluring tenderness and enigmatic confidence, she's not just the typical 'cute shop owner', she's the embodiment of that sly wind blowing from the North, like a fresh air about to dust off the village's preconceived ideas, and undermine the dominance of mayor Comte de Reynaud, played by Alfred Molina. His antagonism with Vianne starts with her inconvenient timing; she opens a chocolate shop during the Lent, much more at Sunday hours. His invitation (more like a polite coercion) to join the church forces her to reveal that she's not religious, not married, which makes the existence of her seven-year-old daughter Anouk (Victoire Thivisol) even more accusing.And with her unusual lifestyle, fittingly red clothing and seemingly defiant attitude toward religion (despite its optimistic and good-hearted facade), Vianne doesn't get the warmest welcome from the townspeople. Yet she's ready to win each heart, one by one, all it will take is one taste from each one's favorite chocolate (which she mysteriously guesses) to reignite a marital flame, or even draw a smile in the face of Armande, her opinionated landlady, played by Judi Dench, the second perfect casting of the film. Armande's bitterness is the sad result of a conflict with her overprotective daughter Caroline (Carrie Ann-Moss) who's forbidden her son Luc to visit his 'badly-influencing' grandmother"". The chocolate shop soon becomes the refuge for Armande and Luc to meet each other and develop a secret bond.The other subplots involve Josephine (Lena Olin) who's brutalized by Serge, her drunken husband, the bartender played by Peter Stormare, and as expected, her growing friendship with Vianne gives her enough confidence to stand against Serge during a violent assault, when she finally overpowers him with a skillet. Thankfully, this is the kind of uninspired caricature that only works because the movie doesn't get any further. The film remains faithful to its initial tone, and never falls in the temptation to depict the religious townspeople as intolerant bigots. And even Molina remains closer to a more aristocratic version of Hercule Poirot than any other mustached villain; he's a man whose prejudices are rooted in marital troubles that led him to vent his anger on a free-spirited female like Vianne. But the film intelligently avoids the reverse Manichaeism that would have placed religion or men as the obligatory scapegoats.""Chocolat"" is all about allowing one's spirit to elevate beyond the limits dictated by a book, and find one's own truth within the inner beauty of what life, or God for that matter, has to offer. Little Anouk has an imaginary friend named Pantoufle, a kangaroo with an injured leg, but it's just an innocent touch to highlight that she's inherited her mother's mysterious sparkle. A romance also blooms with the arrival of a group of gypsies, drafting along the river, among them the handsome guitar player named Roux (Johnny Depp). Depp's chemistry with Binoche never feels like a plot device: we do believe a woman who was so badly received would embrace newcomers with a more generous heart. At the end, all the characters' arcs close in an emotionally satisfying way, not always unpredictable, but it doesn't really affect the enjoyment.Of course, it's tempting to judge ""Chocolat"" with more cynical eyes, but how about imagining how respectful to the audience's sensitivity, the film remains? How one-dimensionally feminist it would have been if other women were victims of men's abuses, how simplistically sentimental if a mother-and-daughter argument between Armande and Caroline had broken, while a simple look was enough to show that the two women finally made peace. And finally, how dreadfully caricatured if an angry torch-wielding mob came to burn the chocolate shop well, I'm grateful to the story for not having taken this path and yet kept the overall simplicity of its plot without depicting the villagers as a one-dimensional bunch, in a way or another.The film's spirit is magnificently conveyed by a catchy guitar tune, transporting us in a universe where benign and innocent temptations, open the Pandora box where we can find the key to our own happiness. Too poetic? Well, that's another adjective that fits with ""Chocolat"".",Chocolat

One of the more popular and appealing English productions with a strikingly foreign accent, including a co-starring role by the up and coming Johnny Depp who actually plays an albeit estranged wanderer but relatively straight character. Juliette Binoche is never better in this tender, subtle seductive, and mesmerizing mystic film about an unsettled single mother who makes a variety of chocolates and settles along with her daughter into this little hamlet overseen by a manipulative mayor who has rigid beliefs of his own. There is a constant underlying tone of hidden agendas, past emotional dysfunctions and a battle of wills between power, religion, and creative, primal impulses. Nominated for five Oscars, this little powerhouse of a movie pulls the audience in with its on-screen struggle of repressed emotions and the tantalizing brilliance of tolerance.

26,pennyelenabooks,chocolate dream,8,11 February 2013,"This film is not recommended to those who are on a low calorie diet, because it makes you want to dive into a bowl of succulent chocolate. It's amazing how a simple movie can do that, without even using the scent to lure you. Chocolate turns an ordinary village of France into a sweet world, a fairy tale among simple people. The costumes and the scenery are very believable, really capturing the era and the atmosphere, of that time. But the story is good as well, without getting boring, speaking about the love that can tie family and friends together, the stereotypes that support closed communities of the countryside and how a simple ingredient like chocolate, can turn everything upside down. Great performances from the main and supporting cast actors and a memorable soundtrack. All in all chocolate is a remarkable film.",Chocolat
27,filipemanuelneto,An interesting and thought-provoking movie.,6,5 February 2017,"This film is a kind of modern tale and speaks essentially of the right to be different and of the injustice we can commit when judging a person we do not know simply because it is different from us. The story, set in a small French conservative village in the sixties, shows the difficulties a woman feels in integrating and thriving a factory of handmade chocolates. The problem is that this woman does not fit into that society, outdated by nature and led by a deeply backward aristocrat, clinging to the ancient privileges of her lineage. She is modern, single mom and her sweet ones have the ability to awaken the most secret desires of those who eat them. It gets worse later, with the arrival of a group of gypsies, which the village initially faces as dangerous rioters. For those who are inattentive, the film may seem like a harsh criticism of the Catholic Church and conservatism, but it is not. It uses religion as a vehicle for criticizing hypocrisy, those people who speak one thing and act in a totally opposite way for convenience, shyness or fear of criticism.The film has excellent scenarios and everything fits very well in context and historical time. The connection between Vianne and the ancient Amerindian people seems a bit forced but ends up being digestible with the unfolding of the film. The actors generally did a great job, but there are three that deserve a special mention, on merit: Juliette Binoche, who plays Vianne in a very pleasant and convincing way, Alfred Molina, in the role of the ultra-conservative Count and Judi Dench, who gave life to the eccentric Armande. The film also features Johnny Depp as the gypsy boss, but he is clearly lefting in this film. His character does not fit well and he lacks chemistry with the cast, particularly Binoche. It was a mistake to conceive his character the way it was conceived.",Chocolat

The situations are not dramatic at all but in exchange, we get tender situations mixed with a bit of drama.The whole feminism sub context works pretty well and it's not pretentious by any means. In fact, it fits with the movie's magical tone.The idea of having chocolate as an important part of the plot makes this the perfect romantic date, plus it has Johnny Depp for the ladies.The plot, costumes, settings, and situations are very wise and sweet for almost every kind of audience.Give ""Chocolat"" a chance and you won't regret but only if you're in the mood.",Chocolat
29,Movie_Muse_Reviews,"Charming and sweet, ""Chocolat"" is a typical but wise morality tale",8,14 June 2010,"""Chocolat"" sounds like a gooey foreign love story, but it's actually a fable with classic story archetypes and a hint of magic, all of which finishes pleasantly with a tender morsel -- err, moral.It's about as sophisticated as chocolate, which is not very sophisticated, so ""Chocolat"" is as easily digested as it is open to criticism for a lack of heady drama. Nominated for five Oscars, one would think it dwells in intellectual territory, but ""Chocolat"" comes from the heart -- and possibly the stomach. ""The Cider House Rules"" director Lasse Hallstrom sees these charms and wisely makes them the focal point of this likable film.Juliette Binoche stars as a mysterious but likable woman name Vianne who comes to a small, bland and morally rigid French town run by the Catholic church and opens a chocolate shop with her imaginative young daughter. We know only that ""the wind brought her"" to this town -- her past remains a mystery, which creates that slightly magical tall tale effect. Within the first fifteen minutes her shop is open for business and she's successfully predicting what each customer's favorite treat will be. Binoche exudes the charm the role requires but never sacrifices sophistication despite not having a clearly established back story.On the opposite end of the spectrum sits Alfred Molina as Comte de Reynaud, the moral authority figure who immediately sees Vianne's shop as an affront to his town and its Catholic principles. Cold on the outside but clearly soft on the inside, of all the Oscar nominations, somehow Molina's performance -- in my opinion the film's best -- was overlooked.Vianne's chocolate creates quite the stir, improving one couple's love life, inspiring a wife (Lena Olin) to leave her abusive husband and reuniting a old woman (Judi Dench) with her grandson. In a more serious film, this would all seem quite convenient and unlikely, but few viewers will fail to notice that chocolate is a metaphor here for something bigger. It embodies that blurred line between what is temptation and what is healthy possibility. That metaphor provides a strong moral fiber for ""Chocolat"" which turns out to be what makes it a fine film. It has a tendency to dull a bit in the middle and the entrance of Johnny Depp late into the run time despite his high billing confuses more than helps the story, but overall ""Chocolat"" is rich in its simplicity. When the young priest, Pere Henri (Hugh O'Conor) delivers the closing words of the film at Easter Mass after appearing as a peculiar and weak character throughout, the story's message becomes abundantly clear and the intention and wisdom of the film shine through.""Chocolat"" could easily be construed as critical of organized religion, Catholicism in particular, but Pere Henri's speech beautifully connects the film's call for embracing life with Christian philosophy. It's a timeless message with timeless components, but the unique premise and setting make ""Chcolat"" a fresh tale of great wisdom.~Steven CVisit my site http://moviemusereviews.com",Chocolat

Starting with a fairly difficult premise (that chocolate can both heal and release the inner soul - and therefore also pose a threat to orthodoxy), the film captivates and carries us under its sway to the very end. Unfortunately, although every aspect seems well-done, the whole is no more satisfying than the parts. The film has a few weighty elements in the storyline but they are so sublimated into the main theme that there is very little left except some nice, easily digestible entertainment. One of the most enjoyable films of the year so far, nevertheless, and one that successfully combines art-house cinema with box-office accessibility.

The chocolates seem to have a mythical power to them which begin to remedy the local's personal issues that the church is not addressing or resolving. The lead pontiff does not like this new dynamic and he tries subtly, secretly and blatantly to dissuade the locals from frequenting the tasty shop. These scenes hit on the core ideas of acceptance vs exclusion, nobody is perfect, enjoy life and a controversial point of shining the Catholic church in the often portrayed negative light for their strict rules for conformity. Will the pontiff change his ways or will the chocolatier leave the town? The acting was solid, cinematography effective and pretty, yet I felt the mystical chocolates were not developed enough or showcased properly for whatever their ambiguous role in the story actually was.",Chocolat

To enjoy the film you have to get past the preachy, anti-Christian message.

This one is about a single mom drifting into a French town and changing the lives of those in the town with her presence, wholesomeness and of course her Chocolate! This like many other Halstrom films is a fantasy but based on reality. The reality here is that the Juliette Binoche character travels from town to town with her daughter trying to figure out how to settle down despite her mother's exact duplicate example. Johnny Depp is a handsome drifter who gives Binoche some company while she fights against the town and their trapped religious ways. The controlling mayor is the enemy of the story and Binoche starts gathering a band of followers which brings more subplots into this wonderful story and angers the mayor.

38,Boyo-2,Sweet at the center,8,4 February 2002,"Very fine movie about the effect one woman, her daughter and her talent for bringing out the best in people in their newest chocolate shop in France. 
Binoche is perfectly cast as Vienne, a woman not tied to traditional values at all - she does not attend church and is not married.  This does not bode well with the Mayor (Alfred Molina) who fancies himself something of a dictator - he wants to tell you how to live and how to feel and even has so much of an influence in church that the young priest often has to be edited on the pulpit by him.Aside from the Mayor, Vienne has an effect on several townspeople, most notably Judi Dench, from whom she is renting the space.  She is an angry woman who has been denied the right to see her grandson, even though he lives in the same small town.  She does not agree with her daughters' methods of upbringing, but Vienne arranges a meeting that brings the two close together.  Also, an abused woman named Josephine, is inspired by Vienne's spirit to leave her husband (Peter Stormare) but is seen in bad light since she is forgetting about her marriage vows.  Josephine works at the shop and is soon an independent person.  Binoche and Dench certainly deserved their Oscar nominations, but Lena Olin as Josephine should have received one, too.

39,triple8,Charming whimsical tale,7,20 February 2005,"SPOILERS THROUGHOUT THIS POST:Chocolat, is a charming whimsical movie with interesting characters, beautiful photography and an interesting overall story. I enjoyed it. It was different then I thought it would be from the previews, less of a fairytale, and more in similarity to a Toby Miguire movie called: Pleasantville, which I'm sure many reading this will have seen. But that is the movie that this strongly reminded me of.This is a very feel good movie and featured a terrific cast. I was a bit surprised by Johnny Depp, he didn't walk away with the movie and steal every scene, to the contrary, his character was extremely underused. But the cast, all of them, were great and the movie a charmer.As good as this was, I didn't adore it, more liked it a lot. It does move slowly and it's long. As mentioned, I expected more of a fairy tale, I think I was expecting a bit to much from the previews, but that's not to put this movie down at all, because it was really well done on all levels. The story is involving, you care about the characters, the movie does have some mystery and fairy tale elements to it, and the linking of Chocolate to joy and love of life is quite touching. This movie may not be perfect but is far from a bad movie.Chocolat maybe thought of as to feel good by some, but I personally do not agree with that, a movie does not have to be dark all through to be a good movie. This is definitely something you have to be in the mood for, because of it's length, and the whole overall mood of the movie and it's not all sweetness and light either, there's some tough scenes (though the ending is as heartwarming as you can get.) Chocolat is a movie I'd rate a 7.5 for good, not a 10(though I could easily see why someone else would rate it a 10.) This is an uplifting charmer of a film, set in a lovely french village, featuring a great cast, a touch of mystery and fantasy elements, capped off with a ""Pleasantville"" type of message. Not a bad way to spend a few hours!",Chocolat
40,philip_vanderveken,"Not as excellent as I hoped it would be, but certainly enjoyable",8,27 April 2005,"Before seeing this film I didn't know very well what to think of it. The movie did get a lot of good reviews and many people recommended it to me, but I wasn't very sure that this would be something for me to see. Well, after hesitating so long, I finally gave it a try, hoping that this would be some kind of modern fairy tale like for instance the marvelous French movie ""Le fabuleux destin d'Amélie Poulin"". Big was my surprise when I finally saw it...The story is rather different from what I thought I would see. It tells the tale of a single mother, Vianne Rocher (Juliette Binoche), who arrives in a small, peaceful and conservative French town with her six year old daughter. She will open a chocolate shop with Sunday hours and across the street from the local church, just as lent is beginning. The local narrow-minded community doesn't really accept this and the mayor will do anything to get it closed as soon as possible. But gradually he looses his grip on his civilians and one by one they get hooked on the delicious chocolates and the warm personality of Vianne...""Chocolat"" is a very nice movie with a nice story, but calling it a masterpiece isn't exactly right. Sure, I liked it a lot, but there were a few things that just didn't give me the satisfaction I was looking for. One thing for example was the language. I know, this may sound very stupid to many, but why do the characters have to speak English in this movie? I mean, they choose a lot of French actors who will play a certain role in a French town, but they all speak English with, so now and then, a little word of French in between. That's really something I didn't understand. Another thing that bothered me a bit was Johnny Depp's role in this movie. He never got a lot of time to show what he's worth. His character is so underdeveloped that it made me believe Depp's only role was to attract as many American viewers as possible, who would otherwise never be interested in this movie.But I have to admit that the movie also had a lot of nice things to offer. As I already said, the story is nice, but it's thanks to the acting of people like Juliette Binoche and the young Victoire Thivisol, that this movie still worked so well. And what shouldn't be forgotten either is the marvelous photography of course. Not only did the village look very nice, so did the chocolate shop and all those tasty-looking sweets. Overall I would say that this may not be a masterpiece, but it's a lovely and heart warming film that certainly deserves a view. I reward it with a 7.5/10, perhaps an 8/10.

42,bandw,Too sweet,5,15 February 2003,"I suppose this movie could have succeeded as a fable, if it were written more directly as such.  As it is, it tries to be as sweet as the confection of the title, while still trying to ground the story in realism.  My ability to suspend disbelief was exceeded in the fist few scenes.  Vianne comes to a small French village, with her daughter in tow, traveling with a small suitcase. Before you know it, she has opened up a rather elaborate chocolate shop with dozens of tempting offerings.  Where did all that chocolate come from?  Certainly not from the suitcase.  Since the village is very religious and it is the beginning of lent, poor Vianne can't seem to peddle any of her chocolates.  But she keeps cranking out more and more delights.  Where is it all going? Also, Vianne must have come to town with a fair bundle of cash, since she is able to get the shop going and keep it in business with no income.       ""Chocolat"" hits you over the head with its message - in fact it also pummels you a bit about the ears with it as well as landing a couple of body blows.  This movie makes Aesop look like a master of subtlety.  Can you really believe that a small group of outcasts and atheists could so easily teach the self-denying devout Christians to live it up?  Where did all those fun-loving celebrants come from in the outdoor party at the end of the movie?  I guess they must have gone to a neighboring village to get the costumes and decorations.                                 
When Vianne finally does lure some people to take a taste of her products, they react with such immediate gratification that, if true, I think Vianne's treats would have to be dispensed as a controlled substance.  Even a taste of the smallest piece seems to be a transformative experience.     Juliette Binoche is lovely as usual, and she does have a winning smile and Judy Dench gives it her best at playing the curmudgeon with a tender heart.  That these two fine actresses wound up in this movie is unfortunate - they could have given us something of much more value.     
If you want to see a movie about the transformative nature of food, see ""Like Water for Chocolate""; if you want to see a movie that celebrates food, see ""Big Night""; if you want a moral tale about getting Christian's to confront their hypocrisy, read Mark Twain's ""The Man that Corrupted Hadleyburg.""  ""Chocolat"" was too sweet for my taste.",Chocolat
43,Sergeant_Tibbs,Mildly enjoyable. Doesn't leave much of an impression.,6,20 September 2013,"In my little quest to watch all the Oscar nominated screenplay nominees, Chocolat now rounds off the 21st Century. I wasn't keen to see this film though I do like the ensemble. Fortunately, it is very well-acted, particularly Juliette Binoche and Judi Dench who both earned well deserved nominations, but the film skims the surface of its story and characters. It's quite an unconventional take on a well established formula. A mysterious figure enters a town, changes it, then leaves. Here, Binoche's chocolate just makes the conservative town horny. Its style is in light supply. Slight comedy, slight tragedy, and it takes obvious turns. Its drama is soap opera- esque at best if not necessarily melodramatic. That's all nice and fine and whatever for brain- off and half-a-tear cinema but it rings false and merely Oscar-baiting. It's still enjoyable and worth it for Binoche but not even Alfred Molina or Johnny Depp could lift it to a place of sincerity. It's not necessarily pretentious but it's certainly overpraised.6/10",Chocolat
44,DeeNine-2,Chocolate reforms the church!,8,2 July 2002,"(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book ""Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!"" Get it at Amazon.)This is an American movie directed by Swedish born director Lasse Hallstrom (The Cider House Rules, 1999; Something to Talk About, 1995), set in France with a distinct French flavor. The cast, headed by the very talented Juliette Binoche as Vianne Rocher, a wandering proprietress of chocolate, is highly accomplished and very much worth watching. Judi Dench has a substantial role as the cranky Armande, and Johnny Depp makes a belated appearance as Binoche's love interest, Roux, the River Rat. Alfred Molina plays the small town's semi-fascist Catholic mayor, Comte Paul de Reynaud. With his slicked-back, straight black hair and the precise black mustache and his imposing countenance, one is somehow reminded of Count Dracula. Leslie Caron (An American in Paris, 1951; The L-Shaped Room, 1963), now in her seventies, has a small part as the widow Madame Audel. Carrie Anne-Moss of Matrix fame (but I recall her most memorably in Memento, 2000) plays Armande's strait-laced and estranged daughter. Noteworthy is the captivating Victoire Thivisol as Anouk Rocher, Vianne's nine-year-old daughter. Thivisol won the best actress award at the Venice Film Festival in 1996 for her work as a four-year-old (!) in Ponette (1996). She is surely the youngest actor ever to win such an award.Chocolat is also a kind of modern Dionysian morality tale in reverse with the Catholic church and small town narrow-mindedness as the bad guys. It gets more than a bit sappy at times, and the unrelenting celebration of outsiders and non-conformists is wearisome and sorely tried my patience throughout. However, just as is the case with chocolate with its uplifting qualities amidst the lure to overindulgence, the good surely outweighs the bad. Hallstrom is an ambitious director who is comfortable playing to an adult feminist audience. He attempts the complex and the unlikely. Here, there is more than the usual Hollywood seduction of the intended audience. There is underneath the surface a strong symbolic presence, giving the story a kind of resonating, fairy tale existence.Chocolate of course serves as the Dionysian wine, but it is also a semi-addictive substance from a tropical American plant, the cacao, rich in sumptuous oils and theobromine, a heart and general nervous system stimulant similar to caffeine. Cocoa was the first stimulant drink to break the unrelenting hold of beer and wine on the European palate. It was quickly followed by coffee and tea. Prior to the rise of these cerebral drinks, it was commonplace for Europeans to drink beer for breakfast, and indeed to drink beer and wine throughout the day. Many believe that caffeine was a handmaiden of the Renaissance, which of course led to the eventual weakening of the hold of the Roman Catholic church. Vianne, who is the daughter of a central American mother and a European father, represents the shamanism of the New World, leading the populace away from the narrow confines of the medieval mentality with her irresistible confections made with the seed of Theoboma cacao.The problem with the movie, and the reason it did not achieve a more wide-spread acclaim, lay not only with its cloyingly unbalanced feminist viewpoint and its anti-Catholicism, but with the difficulty Binoche (and Hallstrom) had with her complex role. Her character is a woman who wants desperately to find a place in society and to be accepted by the petite bourgeoisie while maintaining her personal sense of value (and her red shoes!). She is, in a sense, a gypsy fortune teller (recall the spinning plates) who longs to be a pillar of the community. She is worldly wise, kind and forgiving, but partly a shopkeeper with a shopkeeper's need to set down roots. She is also a Mayan princess born to wander with the sly wind that ushers her about. So, underneath all else, this is a story about finding a home. Because Vianne is frequently attacked for her lifestyle while being the sort of person who does not return insult with insult, Binoche is reduced in many scenes to a kind of tolerant, slightly superior, patient smile that becomes wearying. It is only when Johnny Depp appears that we see the real Juliette Binoche and a true indication of her ability. Incidentally Depp is excellent as a gypsy musician who understands himself and his place as a counter balance to a conservative society. He is an inspiration to Vianne because he alone is not transparent to her; she only discovers his ""favorite"" chocolate by happenstance after two wrong guesses. Depp also serves to save this film from the near monotony of inadequate males and dissatisfied females. When he appears I can almost hear the audience sigh.Incidentally, you might want to compare this to Babette's Feast (1987) in which the narrow-minded and in need of liberation are northern Protestants, while the woman with the tempting goodies is an exiled Catholic chef from France. If Hallstrom had taken a clue from Gabriel Axel, who directed Babette's Feast, and followed a more objective and balanced treatment, Chocolat might have been a great movie. As it is, it is a very interesting one, and one you're not likely to forget or to feel neutral about.",Chocolat
45,bobsgrock,Sweet but not totally satisfying.,7,22 April 2009,"Chocolat is a pleasure for the eyes, a feast of decadent visuals with tasteful costumes, sets and of course, edible delights. The most wonderful thing about this movie has to be the cast, headed by the beautiful Frenchwoman Juliette Binoche as Vianne, a nomad who travels with her daughter and sets up shop in a tiny French village. She is somewhat of a rebel, who doesn't go to church and believes in giving into the desires an passions most people restrict, especially during the holy time of Lent. As Vianne tries to survive the tense and strict society in which she dwells, she comes across various people all with different desires and pleasures, including Judi Dench as a bitter old woman, Carrie-Ann Moss as a strict and upright mother and Lena Olin as a wife with an unsteady home life.All changes for Vianne when Roux,a handsome riverboat wanderer played by Johnny Depp shows up on the shore. He is more of a nomad than she and he inflicts in her desires she never thought she had and soon is beginning to get a taste of her own medicine. Despite this rather stocky and formulaic plot line, the movie is quite enjoyable though not completely satisfying. It dances with ideas about forgetting your moral conscience and giving into every desire, which I am sure cannot be helpful to anyone. Perhaps I am misjudging it, but it seems almost as if the movie is more interested in simply showing the power of the chocolate than the actual process involved in making a change in your life. It does have elements of fantasy, which I don't mind, but I find it hard to mix fantasy with reality and make it work all the way.Despite its shortcomings, this is a sweet and spicy delight with a top-notch cast, some gorgeous sets and costumes, and some interesting twist on chocolate recipes. It makes for a great escapist movie, a place I'm sure we all wish we could go to.",Chocolat

47,baumer,Should make everyone's top ten list this year,9,6 February 2001,"Sometimes I have an averse preconceived notion towards films before I even see them.  I am also addicted to movies so they balance each other out at times.  I have gone into movies like The Matrix, Die Hard and when I was younger, On Golden Pond, with a cocky assurance that I was going to hate these films.  In every case, not only have they proved me wrong, but they have gone on to become some of my favourite films of all times.  I made the same mistake with Chocolat.  Here's how the story goes.I had gone to the closest AMC theater in Oakville to see Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon.  I hadn't seen it yet and the paper said it started at 12:30 pm.  When I got there it actually started at 2:30.  I started work that day 4:00 and there were no other films playing that I hadn't seen.  So my options were either go home and do nothing for a few hours or go see the one film that I ridiculed in my mind as being nothing more than some stupid foreign film about some stupid topic like how chocolate is an aphrodisiac, or something.  So I decided to pay my $8.00 ( expensive matinees at AMC ), get my M&M's and go see the show.  I slouched down in my seat and disdainfully looked around to see the theater half filled with elderly women.  I groaned as I remembered a similar situation last year when I was Topsy Turvy ( a film that I hated).   So I was peeved off.  The movie begins and I am still angry and it begins like the way I thought it would.  Some small dumb-ass village in France or some God foresaken place has their church goers in church and a stupid voice over is telling me that the church runs the town and if you have problems no one wants to hear about them because that is bad for the church and so on.  Then some stupid lady and her daughter wander in and they want to rent a property from some dumb old lady... oh wait a minute, that is Judi Dench, okay, that is cool.  I like Judi Dench, she cracks me up with her abrasiveness.  She was the only thing I liked about Shakespeare In Love.  Anyway.... ....you get the picture.  Twenty minutes into this film I was sitting straight up and loving every single minute of this film.  It had control of me and it never let me go.  I was now in complete submissive splendor as I watched the film about how chocolat can cure marriages, ripen a sour mother/daughter relationship, loosen the tight strings the church has on the town folk and so on.  And the more I watched, the more I realized that the film was just a metaphor for a great many things, but one thing in general. I think it was telling us to lighten up.  The powers that be in this film were always so concerned with not only what was right and wrong but in how they looked doing it.  Vianne ( Binoche ) was concerned with living life. She did not subscribe to the theories of Lent, she was not married but had a daughter, she did not know who the father was and so on.  She is not exactly what you would call a model citizen but she represents a certain freedom. She lives her life the way she sees fit and no one is going to tell her other wise.  Soon, the entire town comes to her for advise and she gives them chocolate.This is one of the best films of the year.  Traffic is the run away winner as the best film of the year but Chocolat is certainly a worthy contender. The cast of Binoche, Dench, Johnny Depp, Alfred Molina ( remember him from Raiders of the Lost Ark, the guy that drops Indy's whip and leaves him in the cave to die and says ""throw me the whip I throw you the idol"" ) Carrie Anne Moss, Peter Stormare and Lena Olin are all excellent and I would hope that Binoche gets some consideration in March.This is not a film that should be missed.  It is almost perfect in every sense and it is one that should be given a chance.  It is also a great date movie.9.5 out of 10",Chocolat

49,jhclues,A Sweet Delight!,10,1 February 2001,"A film to awaken the senses and stimulate the sweet tooth, `Chocolat,' directed by Lasse Hallstrom and starring Juliette Binoche. is both a sensuous and sensational delight.  In the mid 50s, as if borne on the winds of fate, a somewhat mysterious woman arrives in a small town in France, with a young daughter, Anouk (Victoire Thivisol) in tow and a special talent that soon has the townsfolk in quite a stir.  Binoche is Vianne Rocher, a woman who uses her exotic recipe for chocolate to unlock the repressed sensibilities of the predominately Catholic citizenry, heretofore kept under the rigid and righteous thumb of the Mayor, Comte de Reynaud (Alfred Molina), with no respite or help, even from the town's young and inexperienced priest, Pere Henri (Hugh O'Conor).  And because Vianne has the audacity to open her chocolate shop during Lent, when of course her sumptuous treats are forbidden, she quickly runs afoul of the Mayor and a battle of wills between the two ensues.  Her chocolates are irresistible, but the Mayor has tradition and religion on his side, and it puts the free-spirited Vianne-- who has something of the gypsy in her-- to the test. 	As a director, Hallstrom has just the right touch that brings out the best this story has to offer, which is to say, quite a bit.  It's an affecting and funny movie that will touch you emotionally as it involves you with the characters; Hallstrom knows what buttons to push and when, and it works splendidly.  There's a touch of mystery surrounding Vianne that underscores the sensitivity of the story, and Hallstrom never allows it to become maudlin, which successfully maintains the integrity of the drama.  And there are moments throughout the film that evoke an almost dream-like sense of pacification that draw you in as you indulge in the mouth watering visual pleasures of the chocolate.  Be forewarned, though, it's a tough one for diabetics to watch. 	What Hallstrom also has going for him in this one is an absolutely exquisite cast, many of whom give Oscar worthy, memorable performances, beginning with the superb Juliette Binoche.  There's an earthy, enigmatic and classic sense of beauty about her that make her presence on screen captivating; she's simply a joy to behold.  Judi Dench (Amande), meanwhile, does a terrific character turn as a mother whose daughter, Caroline (Carrie-Anne Moss), deems her an embarrassment and a bad influence on her son, Luc (Aurelien Parent-Koening), and Lena Olin (Josephine) is outstanding as well, as an unhappy woman who finds hope in Vianne's undaunted spirit. Three extraordinary performances from gifted actresses that should be recognized with Oscar nominations.  And Molina, too, as the narrow minded Comte, gives possibly the best performance of his career, while Johnny Depp (Roux) lends some charm as the leader of a roving community of river people. 	Rounding out the supporting cast are John Wood (Guillaume), Peter Stormare (Serge) and Leslie Caron (Madame Audel).  Possibly the `sweetest' film of the year, as well as one of the best, `Chocolat' is a visual and emotional triumph that will warm your heart and make your taste buds salivate, with a story and characters as rich and satisfying as the candy they embrace.  It's a film with a human touch whose images and sensitivity will remain with you long after the screen has gone dark; an uplifting, entertaining movie that proves that the answers to the mysteries of life just may be found in that box of chocolates, after all.  I rate this one 10/10.",Chocolat
50,johno-21,Chocoless,6,3 March 2006,"I saw this in the theater during it's initial release and although I felt this was a good movie it certainly wasn't anything special. Director Lasse Hallström and actor Johnny Depp are reunited for this film from doing What's Eating Gilbert Grape early in their film careers. I like Johnny Depp who alway gives a great performance and manages to find himself in a lot of off-beat quirky films and roles. He seems neutered here and his the dangerous, quirky side of his persona seems to be missing here. Juliette Binoche doesn't seem to have much depth to her character. Judi Dentch, Lena Olin and Lelslie Caron round out the cast and it was nice to see Caron in a film again. this film is photographed beautifully with wonderful cinematography and a great soundtrack. I never read the novel by Joanne Harris from which this is adapted but this film never seems to get off the ground. I would give it a 6.5 of a possible 10.",Chocolat

Juliette Binoche lights up this delightful film as does all the cast and it is unusual to have a film that has Johnny Depp in it and not have too much to say about his role. Not that it's bad , it good'but all the characters are so interesting and well acted he is overshadowed a little.

Since then, I've viewed ""Chocolat"" and now have to eat my words. You could argue that ""Chocolat"" is more than a simple romantic comedy, and you'd be correct. There are story lines detailing the relationship between a footloose mom, and the daughter who wants roots and stability, as well as other relationships dealing with family conflicts and parochial bigotries. But in its heart ""Chocolat"" is a romantic fairy tale; touching, tender and sweet. And in spite of that it's a good movie, recommended for a rental.",Chocolat
53,Benjamin-M-Weilert,"A charming, if not wholly predictable movie.",8,17 May 2019,"Chocolat (2000) is one of those movies that I was aware of but hadn't watched until recently. While it received a Best Picture nomination, I don't think it was up to the level of the winner for that year, Gladiator (2000). Nevertheless, Chocolat is a charming story that lies somewhere between Footloose (1984), Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory (1971), and Babette's Feast (1987). What's maybe a little odd to me about this movie is how I thought Johnny Depp would have a more prominent role in it, since he covers almost half the movie poster. Instead, it's more a bit part that comes in about half-way through the film.While the conclusion of Chocolat is practically telegraphed from the start, it was still entertaining to watch the townspeople warm to the newly arrived chocolatier. Despite most of the characters might feeling a little one-dimensional, they are so fully fleshed out in the one or two qualities that make them distinguishable that you can't help but enjoy watching them react precisely the way you expect them to. Perhaps this predictability helped me appreciate this film since I didn't have to spend too much effort trying to figure out what was happening.Of particular note, I have to say that Alfred Molina and Judy Dench were perhaps some of my favorite characters in this film overall. They were practically two different ends of the spectrum when it came to the chocolate shop, but their performances rather balanced each other out in their own entertaining ways. If I were to choose a favorite, it would definitely be Molina's Comte de Reynaud. Even if his portrayal of religion-based Christianity (instead of relationship-based Christianity) was a bit of a stereotype when movies need a villain who opposes anything ""fun.""A charming, if not wholly predictable movie, I give Chocolat 4.0 stars out of 5.",Chocolat
54,stamper,I've always had a sweet-tooth,8,21 November 2001,"I can honestly say that this is not my favourite movie of the year 2000, but it still ranks very high in that list of movies. Also it ranks highest among the films which I have heard little about, but which I liked anyway. I mean this film got 5 Oscar Nominations, made more then 100 Million Dollars at the Box - Office and had big (and/or quality) names attached to it (Johnny Depp, Juliette Binoche and Judi Dench). Despite all these factor's I didn't know about that film until I saw it standing on a shelf in the store I rent my movies at. To be honest, from the title, the cover and the parts I read at the backside of the film's package, I was convinced this was some touchy/feely romantic crap. (Oh boy was I wrong). This did not stop me from renting it though, first of all because of the Oscar nominations, second of all because of the big names attached and third of all because Johnny Depp rarely let's me down. Well the instinct had not forsaken me and I must admit I enjoyed this pretty much. The acting was good, there were laughs, romantic parts, sad parts, exciting parts in a few words everything that life and good film can offer. This film is really well made and acted and (contrary to most films nowadays) gives you something to think about, after you have watched the film. It is truly beautiful and poetic. Really, well done.8 out of 10",Chocolat
55,TheNorthernMonkee,feel good fun with a spring in it's step,8,5 September 2005,"SPOILERS Chocolate has certain chemical advantages. Causing the same release of chemicals as sexual gratification, the cocoa bean has been eaten with desirable results for centuries. Joanne Harris' novel about a woman who revolutionises a French town through chocolate is obviously aware of this and thankfully the film adaptation keeps this in mind. Well acted and with a wide range of enigmatic characters, the film is a feel good story which (just like chocolate itself) leaves you both happy and desperate for more.A small French village, led by the Comte De Reynaud (Alfred Molina), is a place of contained misery. A group of people who keep their emotions and feelings bottled up and reject all gratification in favour religious purity, things need to change. So when the mysterious Vianne Rocher (Juliette Binoche) and her daughter Anouk (Victoire Thivisol) turn up and create the ultimate temptation in the form of life altering chocolate, the Comte is less than overjoyed.There's this strange feeling that one gets as they watch ""Chocolat"". Certain films induce desires of one extreme or the other. If you watch a romance, you will probably feel the desire for love. If you watch a particularly violent movie, you'll find yourself with a desire to attack someone (this is a desire rather than a necessity of course and not something to be acted upon). So when you watch ""Chocolat"" you find yourself with this enormous, obvious desire to pig out through a box of fancy chocolates. Not necessarily Cadbury or another ordinary selection, but something fancy.The chocolate lust induced leads to one conclusion. Irrelevant of whether you love the plot or not, the way the film shows chocolate as a thick beautiful fluid is magnificent. Similar to cooks like Floyd, Rhodes, Smith and others, the film shows you how well the food can be good and by the end you are literally drooling.At the other end of the scale, if you don't find yourself drooling over the chocolate, you can always drool over Juliette Binoche. Not a personal favourite when it comes to acting, Binoche turns in a suitably brilliant performance here. Showing a woman who feels obligated to move on when the time is right (a novel comparison with the villagers and their own personal sacrifices), Binoche adds a reality to a character who must not have been easy to portray. At the same time though, she also adds a remarkable air of sexuality to an almost mother like role. She might be aided by magnificent performances from a cast including Molina, Dame Judi Dench and Johnny Depp, but it is Binoche who is deservedly named first. She is a majestic lead and the film is better for her presence.If there is any complaint to be made of ""Chocolat"" it is that the script begins badly. Adapted from the book by Robert Nelson Jacobs, the general layout of the story flows remarkably well. In the first thirty minutes or so however, the lines don't work particularly well and you find yourself grimacing at times. Jacobs does improve, like the film in general, as the story progresses, but by this time it would not be surprising if some had turned the film off.Despite the disappointing beginning, ""Chocolat"" is a film worth watching. Brilliantly acted and often beautiful to watch, it is an entertaining piece which will leave you with a huge grin and a feeling of well being. Like chocolate itself, you can't help but feel that life is better with ""Chocolat"" around.",Chocolat
56,LeRoyMarko,Enchanting fairy tale,9,1 April 2001,"This movie is like a fairy tale. It's an escape from daily life and a voyage to a beautiful medieval-look village of France. There, you get to know lovable characters like the new arrival in town, the «chocolatière», played by Juliette Binoche. It's almost like a bedtime story where you know that everything will end happily, but it's still interesting to know how things will turn out.The acting is very good. I liked Juliette Binoche, Lena Olin, Judi Dench and little Victoire Thivisol. Alfred Molina was doing a terrific job as the Count de Reynaud. The only exception was Johnny Depp. I don't really know why he had to be in this movie.

57,barryrd,Village Discord Erupts when Chocolate Shop Opens,8,17 August 2014,"Chocolat is a beautiful movie telling a tale of a newly arrived shop owner versus the established order in a Northern French village, post World War II. The movie also has sidebar stories of spousal abuse, difficult parent-child relationships, and romance. The movie has some quirky humour that brings comic relief to the misfortunes. The cast is outstanding with Juliette Binoche, the village's recently arrived chocolatier; Johnny Depp, as Roux another newcomer; and Judy Dench, as the free spirited grandmother who has been ostracized by the village and her own daughter. Leslie Caron has a minor role as one of three widows. Juliette Binoche plays a very warm and somewhat unconventional young woman who takes over a patisserie where she sets up a chocolate shop with flavours that disarm and delight everyone who tastes them. However, the village is not about to embrace the new entrepreneur; the village mayor dislikes anyone who threatens his petty tyranny and this includes the new chocolatier and Johnny Depp's group of merrymaking gypsies. When the small town bigotry turns violent, the village priest, a mere lad, finally breaks from the mayor's rigid code of morality that he has been all too willing to follow. Eventually the two sides in this battle collide. In the end, the chocolate becomes a decisive weapon in the village war. When the dust settles, the viewer can feel a sense of satisfaction in this well paced and thoroughly entertaining movie.",Chocolat

59,raymond-15,This film should appeal to all chocolate eaters.,7,1 April 2002,"If you are looking for lots of action, this film is not for you. On the other hand if chocolate is your favourite confection, you will forgive this omission and simply drool over the close-ups of delicious-looking shiny chocolates in every conceivable shape and form.  Apart from a scene where an arsonist decides to set fire to a river boat. much of the film centres around the setting up of a new shop in a French provincial town. Monsieur le Comte (Afred Molina) is the mayor whose aim in life is to keep the little town morally safe, in utter tranquillity, and to reject outsiders who might possibly not abide by the Ten Commandments and consequently upset the peace of the populace.Into this sleepy town come Vienne (Juliette Binoche) and her young daughter who together transform a rather dusty old shop into a most attractive store specialising in chocolate. Alas! Alas! It is the season of Lent and no parishioner should be tempted by such delicious trifles. It is the work of the devil, thinks the mayor, and he accuses Vienne and threatens her. ""I'll have you out before the end of Lent!""The story is simple but charming.  There are some nice characters, and some odd ones too. Vienne's kindness and generosity win the hearts of the locals who sneak into her little shop. The local young priest who is dominated by the mayor is an interesting charater, rather unsure of his arguments at the confessional with the man and his dog. I don't know why Johnny Depp undertook such a small role as a guitar-playing itinerant.  I had hoped to see more of him.In one of the final scenes when the mayor gets an uncontrollable craving for chocolates, the film moves into utter farce which I felt spoilt the over all tenor of a charming film.",Chocolat
60,skepticskeptical,Charmant et Agréable,7,16 February 2020,"Chocolat should be in French--that´s my only major complaint. Of course it would never have garnered any Oscar nominations in that case (beyond that for best foreign film), but it did not win any of them anyway. Why not?Perhaps because as pleasant and beautiful as this film is, it offers up a kind of fairytale for the average film-goer. We all sympathize with the rogue lady who rolls into town with her illegitimate child, refuses to go to church, and makes friends of the marginal members of her new society. Chocolate serves to bring people together, to clarify their thought, to increase their tolerance and generally promote world peace. What´s not to like?In reality, let´s think about Vichy France. Most French people at the time fell into the ¨go along to get along¨ camp. So while we may *say* that we would welcome the river rats (gypsies are a phenomenon throughout Europe...), the truth is quite otherwise among good upstanding bourgeois folks.Still, I enjoyed this fable. The images of the chocolate were truly delicious, and it would be wonderful if we could get people to treat one another better just by passing out chocolate. No more road rage, no more bar brawls, no more domestic violence, no more bombing campaigns. Let Them Eat Chocolate!!!!!",Chocolat
61,bigverybadtom,The Novel Was Supposed To Have Been Better,4,29 August 2021,"The plot is rather simple: a free spirit single woman and her daughter move into a provincial French village in 1959 France during Lent, and opens up a chocolate shop in the town during this time while refusing to attend the town's Catholic church, to the displeasure of the town's residents, especially the town's powerful mayor. Of course the woman would become a hero when she rescues a woman from a brutal husband and her chocolate creations serve to make people happy.The movie is beautifully crafted, but what is the whole point? An outsider hero is supposed to descend on a group of unenlightened provincial natives, showing she has the better way of thinking and living, and her chocolate is supposed to be the magic formula to solve problems, and she becomes the local hero. Problem is, a more realistic scenario would be that she would have been shunned and likely run out of town for being a troublemaker, and from my own experience chocolate is delicious, but hardly a magic solution to problems.The movie succeeded, but not in France, Even French atheists probably did not care for this story.",Chocolat
62,FlickJunkie-2,Richly textured and thought provoking,9,1 October 2001,"Chocolat is a film with a story as richly textured as the confections sold by Vianne in her Chocolaterie.  It is a story of many layers that appears to be one flavor on the outside, but changes as the confection dissolves in our psyche.  On its face, it is a story about an endless drifter named Vianne (Juliette Binoche) and her daughter Anouk, who take up residence in a small French town in the 1950's and open a Chocolate shop right in the middle of Lent.  However, once the initial layer melts away we realize that this is not a story about Vianne, but really a story about the town and its people.Vianne is more of a catalyst to the stories around her than a story unto herself.  Ironically, Binoche is a lead actor in a supporting role despite having the camera on her most of the time.  If there is one consistent theme that runs through the film it is one of reconciliation.  Prior to Vianne's arrival, several of the townspeople had survived in a kind of stasis, with unresolved issues never addressed or confronted.  Vianne is the straw that stirs the drink and brings various issues into the open to be examined and resolved.The film has a strong feminist subtext, which is not objectionable by itself, but too often becomes strident and preachy.  Of greater value is the subtle message that provincial ignorance is well served by exposure to new and non-conforming ideas (Vianne and Roux) and that the forces that promote ignorance and conformity out of fear change (Comte de Reynaud) are no match for the power of knowledge and the freedom to exercise it.  In this way, the film is very uplifting and relevant despite its folksy telling.As he did with `The Cider House Rules', Lasse Hallstrom lets the story dominate the screen, bringing us well developed character studies without excessive directorial stylizing.  Hallstrom's strength lies in character interpretation and in guiding the actors to broaden and deepen their portrayals.  This is clearly evident here.Juliette Binoche gives a wonderful performance that earned her a best actress nomination from the Academy.  Judy Dench continues to make great acting a routine, garnering her third best supporting actress nomination for her role.  Lena Olin gives a standout performance as the battered wife struggling to regain her self esteem.  Alfred Molina is also excellent as the oppressive mayor trying to pull the strings of the townspeople in a desperate attempt to maintain the status quo.This is a terrific film with numerous thought provoking subthemes.  While it is not a powerful film, it is a substantial film.  I rated it 9/10.  It is a delight for the thoughtful and intelligent viewer who enjoys a well developed human drama.",Chocolat

Might sound soppy, but this is a quirky, frequently incredibly funny and superbly acted film.Love interest Depp is a 'river rat', who lives a nomadic life himself up and down the rivers.Well scripted and directed along with some good acting performances also, this is a must see and should be a top contender for this year's awards.",Chocolat

I only recorded it because it has Johnny Depp in it... but it was actually quite enjoyable.The movie is about a woman who moves to this tiny little religious village and opens a chocolate shop... the problem is she is not religious and she opens the shop when most of the town are about to fast. This does not make her the most popular person.The film stars Juliette Binoche as the main character Vianne. Vianne is such a likable character. She is friendly to everyone even if the other people are mean to her, she seems to just smile and forgive them. It is no wonder the town grows to love her. Juliette does a great job in her role. She was believable and she really made you feel sorry for her when things were going bad. The movie also stars Johnny Depp, Judi Dench, Alfred Molina & Lena Olin. Everyone does a good job, especially Alfred. I think he plays a great mayor and evil goit. His religions beliefs really turn him into a mean person.The story is a mixture of things... comedy, drama & romance. When there were comedy moments, they really were funny... and the romance was alright i suppose. Not really my thing.This is a fun film to watch and I would watch it again... it is not Johnnys best movie, but it is understandable why he agreed to make it.I will give this film 7 out of 10.It is just a nice and fun film.For more reviews, please like my Facebook page:https://www.facebook.com/pages/Ordinary-Person-Movie- Reviews/456572047728204?ref=hl",Chocolat
66,jhaggardjr,Sweet and charming,8,24 February 2001,"""Chocolat"" is one of those movies that is just so sweet and charming. I just couldn't resist myself while watching this movie. It's so likable. Not only that, ""Chocolat"" is very well acted by an international cast of actors. Oscar-winning French actress Juliette Binoche (""The English Patient"") stars as a woman who breezes into a small French village (with her young daughter) and sets up shop as a maker of magic chocolates that brings happiness and joy to those who stop in for a taste. Binoche (nominated for Best Actress this year) is terrific in this movie, and so is everyone else. Oscar-winning British actress Dame Judi Dench is featured in another one of her great film roles as Binoche's crabby and stubborn landlady who begins to show off her good side once she takes a taste of those chocolates. She is currently up for Best Supporting Actress. Another Brit, Alfred Molina, has the role of the strict mayor of the town who thinks something fishy is going on with that new woman in town. Oscar-nominated Swedish actress Lena Olin (""Enemies: A Love Story"") is the battered wife of the local bar owner (played by another Swede, ""Fargo's"" Peter Stormare) who comes to work for Binoche. Canadian Carrie-Anne Moss (from ""The Matrix"") plays Dench's estranged daughter who's son secretly visits Grandma. And American Johnny Depp is the young man who also lends a hand to Binoche, and in the process falls in love with her. ""Chocolat"" isn't a great movie. There are a few scenes of downright silliness, but that's only a minor complaint. It's a very likable romantic comedy with good performances. *** (out of four)",Chocolat
67,AKS-6,Not one of Hallström's best,6,22 September 2001,"One thing is for certain, Lasse Hallström has had a dream cast to work with on Chocolat: Juliette Binoche, Judi Dench, Peter Stormare, Alfred Molina, Johnny Depp, Lena Olin... Fantastic. And they are all great. The film is not great, but it is beautiful and charming. Though far from Hallström's best, Chocolat is still rather entertaining. (6/10)",Chocolat
68,AvidClimber,Chocolat — The tale of a mother and her will to help using cocoa,8,17 March 2013,"Chocolat is about the oddball in the village, the outsider bringing new perspective. It's presented to us as a tale told from mother to daughter, almost like a legend.The photography is beautiful. The sets are very immersive and realistic, with fitting wardrobe. The story is interesting and light hearted, with some hit of drama and laughters. The characters are well built and very well played.The most annoying thing about this film is the mix of accent, real or false. I admit it's probably because French is my mother tongue, but still. You eventually get used to it though. Also, the ending is just too perfect, especially concerning the mayor. I know the whole story has a fairy- tale undertone, but he completely reverse not only his view on the stranger, but also his demeanor and his religious views on the sanctity of marriage. It's too much.Still, I recommend to everyone, especially if you like a bit of romance and tall tales.",Chocolat
69,majikstl,Artificial sweeteners...,5,5 April 2004,"A mysterious woman arrives in a small town and scandalizes everyone by opening a ... brothel?  No. A saloon? No. A chapter of NOW? No. She opens a candy store. Oh horrors of horrors, how will they survive?Okay, even granting that the story takes place in 1959 during lent, it is hard to believe that any town in the world -- with the possible exception of politically correct Marin County -- would be appalled by the selling of chocolate treats within the city limits. Plus this little town is in France, of all places! But the little town is religious and conservative and the chocolate is symbolic of the sweet taste of personal freedom, so blah, blah, blah. Even if you allow CHOCOLAT the freedom to be nothing more than a fable, the film leaves a sour taste in your mouth. A story that might take flight if told with whimsy and enchantment, instead lies there like a lump of rock candy and is almost as difficult to digest. They even toss in the almost mandatory abused wife subplot, turning the tale from semi-sweet to dark, just to let us know that it is 100% feminist friendly.This confection's one saccharine free ingredient is the always delicious Juliette Binoche, whose Mary Poppins interpretation is smooth and easy to swallow. Plus Johnny Depp, Judi Dench and Hugh O'Conor add a dash of tang. But even so, one wishes it didn't have so many artificial sweeteners. I'll stick with good old-fashioned, all-American Hershey bars, thank you very much.",Chocolat
70,paulcreeden,"More taste, less filling.",8,31 December 2000,"This delightful mixture of fable and allegory is beautifully dipped in rich, creamy views of life in a mythic French village. Lasse Hallstrom adds another intriguing facet to the body of his art. The one sustaining theme of the film, in my opinion, is best represented by Dame Judi Dench's role as an estranged elder, who consciously and intelligently defies the rigid conventions of her world at great cost. The center conflict between Afred Molina, as the Mayor, and Juliette Binoche, as the mystical confectioner, was entertaining, but hollow as a chocolate Easter bunny. Lena Olin's battered wife was very well acted, but the character was also a bit thin. Johnny Depp was very good as a wispy hippy Celt. The child actors were adept and suitably restrained. Smaller roles, well done by Mr. Wood and Ms. Caron, deepened the film's charm. Hugh O'Conor, as the village curate, was a comic highlight. This film is not profound, but it is alluring. Like an opened box of chocolates on a coffee table, it is likely to be revisited over and over again.",Chocolat
71,theshadow908,A very tasty piece of cinema.,8,19 February 2006,"In 1959, a single mother opens a small chocolate shop in a small town in France. People enjoy the chocolate, but the shop comes under fire when it stays open during lent, causing temptation among the townspeople.Chocolat has an awesome story that is kept in balance with everything going on in the town it takes place in. The movie doesn't solely focus on the problems the woman (well played by Juliette Binoche) is having with her chocolate shop, but also with the town's mayor, an abusive husband, a woman's relationship with her mother, and a band of gypsies that come passing through. All of these unconnected events are inextricably linked through the chocolate shop that opens in the town. I like how well the movie flows with a nice blend of comedy and drama. Surprisingly, one of the most engaging things in the film is the woman's daughter's relationship with her imaginary friend, an injured kangaroo. My favourite character though is Roux, the gypsy that befriends the woman.Everyone in the movie does a really good job in their roles. I could watch Johnny Depp sleeping and still enjoy his performance, so I naturally liked him in this movie. I found Alfred Molina pretty funny as the mayor of the town. All in all, this is a really good film worth checking out. If nothing else, it will make you hungry.8/10",Chocolat
72,Mort-31,Rather beautiful than appetizing,7,3 August 2001,"It's true that Chocolat` uses every possible small village stereotype: the old witch, the conservative mayor, the old man in love with a widow, the brutal ruffian, and so on. It's true that, bathing in hot chocolate, one might forget the fact that the whole story doesn't make any sense. The narrator's ironic-erotic voice wants to tell us something; what? The story of one person stirring up a whole town is not new: the Oscar-winning Danish movie Babette's gæstebud` was one of the first movies that wanted nothing more than to TASTE (and did quite well). It's also true that only Hollywood can happily ignore the hurting illogicality of a French actress speaking English with a French accent to English speaking American actors who impersonate Frenchmen in the middle of France.But it's also true that I was sitting in the theater for two hours and was perfectly entertained. I got carried away by a dense story taking place at only one scene  a lovely (or well photographed) little village. Lasse Hallström may not be the most sophisticated director in Hollywood but he can create an atmosphere and catch the audience for exactly the time they are watching his film: not more and not less: he's Hollwood! The convincing performance of Juliette Binoche and the appearance of old lady Dame Judi Dench strengthen the positive feeling.I would not have nominated the movie for Best Picture. I wouldn't use it as an appetizer` either because there is a little too much chocolate (on the meat!) inside. I would suggest just to watch it (if you don't know what else to watch, or if you prefer a quiet, melancholic, humorous night) and enjoy it. 7 out of 10.",Chocolat

74,jackasstrange,Both artistic and very entertaining,8,29 December 2013,"Chocolat is a good film. The plot is indeed very good, and despite being simple at a first sight it have various layers and subtle symbolism, specifically in the 'chocolate' types. For example, for the boy with a spicy personality, bitter chocolate she offered. And to the woman depressed, scarred by life,with bitter personality, she then offered spicy chocolate. The chocolat itself represented some kind of a freedom and liberation of the repressed side of the persons. Very interesting, and it's definitely a film to be appreciated. The way the city reacts is also very curious. The characters which appears in the film have special kind of personality and a subtle meaning in them as well. And is up to the viewer to discover what these meanings are.The art direction is also good, very suggestive and definitely is important to the film overall. The natural aura that the film exudes has much to do with the excellent work in the lightning and in the scenario,with rudimentary, but harmful stores in the small Italian city. The soundtrack is wonderful, and fits perfectly each scene. The acting is overall very good, Alfred Molina,Julliete Binoche and Judi Dench specifically are stunning in their roles.I highly recommend this film. 8.2/10",Chocolat
75,smakawhat,Sinfully Delightful,7,6 March 2001,"Enter a rural French village 1959.  In this village a woman arrives with her young daughter.  The town is extremely conservative headed by a sucpicious mayor who is not to fond of this new person.  For she does not go to church, and even has the nerve to open up a shop during lent, and not just any shop... a CHOCOLATE shop..  sin of sins..As the locals one by one find out more about the shop, Binoche's character plays the temptress by awakening their hidden desires with the delictable sweets she makes up.  The story has that very once upon a time feel, and it centres on the plot that Binoche and her daughter keep moving from town to town (cause her shop is to radical for the conservative rurals) as she is never accepted, and some side plots involving an old woman who doesn't get to see her grandson from her possesive daughter, and another woman who after visiting the shop attempts to leave her abusive husband and change her life by working in the store.I was quite surprised with this film.  I didn't expect much but it is actually pretty good.  It could have been better with a more fluid story and some more interesting characters and performances.  The performances of the grandmother (Judi Dench) and Juliette Binoche as the chocolatier are very good, and the food shots are great which certainly make the picture even better (love those food movies).Sinfully delightful!!!

77,benoit-3,From pure cocoa to pure caca...,3,19 January 2006,"As Homer Simpson famously said, ""once upon a time in a magic land of make-believe called France..."", some well-intentioned souls imagined a story that unfortunately has nothing to do with France or Frenchmen, full of bad, repressed, Catholic and decadently noble tightwads and gentle, liberated free souls bent on showing them that chocolate is the key to opening the senses, broadening minds and bringing about world peace. In order to make this cloying illusion complete, no actual Frenchman was harmed (or used) during the making of this film - except Hollywood's Française de service du jour, Juliette Binoche. A very tenacious analysis of the art direction, costumes, etc., might help establish that the film aimed for a period falling anywhere between the Middle Ages and 1953 (before television anyway), but it turns out the film was supposed to be set in 1959, a period that was famous for its political and social upheavals, the popularity of Brigitte Bardot as a role model for young women and the inroads of rock and pop music in mainstream French culture, none of which is reflected in this film, which presents France as a backwash of Mongolia. Whatever the merits of this sad, manipulative and weepy chick-flick and its generic pastel-coloured morality may be, it is a perfect commercial fit for a bloated matriarchal, North-American society hungry for risk-free temporal and spatial exoticism, comprising the greatest number of obese people and diabetics in the world and where everything but dental floss, mouthwash and toothpaste (if that!) is now available in a chocolate flavour.",Chocolat
78,werefox08,Binoche ..........is Simply Brilliant,7,14 September 2012,"Chocolat was nominated for 5 Academy Awards, and made a lot of money at the box office. The brilliant performance of Juliette Binoche has a lot to do with this movies success. She has the right look (a sort of Gypsy). Also she is a power of nature with attitude. She is in most scenes so her great acting was pivotal to the overall movie. The fact that she is sexy (very) is also a plus. Johnny Depp was the wrong choice to play the Irish Gypsy who is strongly attracted to Binoche. His performance is weak and does not hold a candle to the Binoche presence. The movie is O.K., using the good versus evil theme (which has been done before !!). There is a nice kind of magic about the use of chocolate as the central drug. Its a nice movie...and perhaps in the year 2000 lots of people liked nice movies. Who knows ?? Maybe this kind of nice movie may work to-day",Chocolat
79,overseer-3,A Whole Town Drugged By Cocoa,10,7 September 2001,"We very rarely go to modern movies anymore, but my husband and I decided to give Chocolat a go on a lark one evening when it first came out. We are just not Gladiator and Planet Of the Apes type filmgoers;  we like films that show normal people living normal lives (I know, a real fringe element!), hopefully showing characters with a sense of humor and inner strength being tested and challenged. Chocolat partly delivers, but in a disturbing way.A strange New Age guru lady and her young daughter descend on a French Catholic city in the late 1950's (pre-Vatican 2). The Mayor controls the town with some pretty stereotypical Nazi behaviors: propaganda, gossip, controlling the clergy, etc. The villagers are hungering for Truth To Set Them Free, but what do they get instead of the Christian gospel? Drugged chocolate is what frees them, folks! This is one of the best films promoting drug use to ever come out of Hollywood! Miramax you are just too obvious.The film seemed to be compromising on people's core religious values throughout. Did the New Age religion and paganism promoted by Vianne's character win out, or did the Roman Catholic Priest win out by softening their hearts with a sermon? (Notice how the priest uses the words ""our Lord's transformation"" in the last sermon scene instead of the more appropriate words ""our Lord's resurrection."" - What did He ""transform"" into? A cuckoo clock?). Why was Disney-Miramax so loathe to use the word ""resurrection"" or say the name of ""Jesus"" (except for Johnny Depp using it in vain before jumping into the water to ""save"" Vianne during the fire scene). Very telling moments to me.These contrasts were even discernable in the musical soundtrack. The same lady who won an Oscar for Miramax's ""Emma"" soundtrack created these deep soaring romantic pieces as the main themes (which sounded like outtakes from ""Emma"" btw), but thrown in for competition was the sensual guitar strummings of jazz, probably symbolizing the pent up sexual frustrations of the townsfolk.To sum up, I cannot recommend this film for Christian moviegoers. Catholics might be insulted by many scenes insulting their church, and Christians are better off not exposed to its New Age spiritualism.",Chocolat
80,ldavis-2,"""Footloose"" with truffles",3,13 July 2003,"No woman during the 1950's - even someone as unconventional as Vianne - would volunteer that she has never been married and, hence, her child is illegitimate. Indeed, Reynaud wouldn't have gossiped to the villagers about her, but made sure Vianne's shop closed before it opened, and sent her packing.Armande describing the shop's décor as ""early Mexican brothel"" is funny, but, since we can assume she has never been to Mexico, such an observation wouldn't have popped into her head.Hallström letting his non-French actors not sound French isn't nearly as bad as how he tries to shoehorn some reality into his fable, then, as if he's afraid there's TOO much realism, has Reynaud get in line in a way that is completely out of character, and - in light of how he deals with the Serge/Josephine situation - cruel and undeserved. I find it a stretch that Vianne and Henri manage to keep it to themselves. And why didn't anyone hear him break in?Reynaud is not the baddie the movie needs to create tension, and, without tension, there isn't anything at stake. It's only a matter of time before Vianne wins everyone - and Reynaud - over, and all is right with the world.By the way, the town's name, Lansquenet, is derived from the German ""landsknecht"" (""valet of the fief""), a term applied to a mercenary, which I found interesting as Josephine's dad was a Nazi informer.",Chocolat

I wanted to see more of her.  My annoyance comes with the treatment of conservatives as the evil nasty people who want to spoil everyone's fun.  Frankly, I am sick of this theme.

Who will win in the end?This is a simple story, yet it has great depth and mystery.  Johnny Depp as Roux is the perfect catalyst that really makes the whole story begin to churn.

84,danielll_rs,Chocolate is irresistible and CHOCOLAT is delightful,5,5 March 2001,"CHOCOLAT (2000) *** Directed by Lasse Hallström. Starring: Juliette Binoche, Judi Dench, Alfred Molina, Lena Olin, Johnny Depp, Carrie Anne-Moss.It was February 13 when the Oscar nominees were announced. As I was at school, I had to tape it. As it happens in every year, I was waiting anxiously for them and had a slight idea of what and who would be nominated. But in any moment I imagined that CHOCOLAT would receive 5 Oscar nominations, including best picture. I was too silly to think that the Miramax lobby wouldn't work, but I really had no idea. First of all, I became a bit angry. ALMOST FAMOUS is being released in Brazil only next week, so I still haven't seen it, but everyone who watched it liked and that's the kind of film that I appreciate. I'm sure it's better than CHOCOLAT, but these things happen. Many other great movies were forgotten (DANCER IN THE DARK, AMERICAN PSYCHO, THE VIRGIN SUICIDES, QUILLS, CHICKEN RUN, REQUIEM FOR A DREAM...)  but the truth is that CHOCOLAT isn't bad at all. For sure it didn't deserve the nomination for best picture, even if 2000 was a very weak year for cinema, but it is a very fine film indeed.CHOCOLAT is a kind of triumph of clichés. There are plenty of them, but they are so well used that the film becomes adorable. In another time, it would mean everything I always defeat in movies, but not now. The story brings nothing new: a stranger arrives in a small village just to change everyone's life in the place. In this case, the stranger is a woman named Vianne Rocher (Juliette Binoche), who arrives in a French village with her daughter Anouk (BTW, the girl of the wonderful French film PONETTE) and rents a building from a grumpy old woman, Armande (Judi Dench). She opens a chocolate shop, as she can prepare any kind of them as none. The problem is that it is Lent time and they are at a Catholic town. She doesn't go to church, so soon the mayor of the town, the Count of Reynard (Alfred Molina) sets up a big trouble with her. The majority of the inhabitants stay against her, with the exception of some few, including Armande, who doesn't talk to her daughter (Carrie Anne Moss), and Josephine Muscat (Lena Olin), a woman considered nuts who suffers with a violent husband (Peter Stormare). Vianne's situation will change, for better or worse, when an Irish gypsy named Roux (Johnny Depp) arrives. It's basically a story about the tradition against the innovating habits, but it works better as an enchanting fable about our desires and temptations, with some very peculiar characters (the daughter who sees a kangaroo, the old woman who used to swim naked on the river, the mayor who still waits for his wife who left him and can't invite his secretary to go out, the middle-aged couple who finds desire again). There are some very funny moments and lines and a story that keeps our interest during the whole film. I haven't read the book, but I believe the screenplay writer followed it faithfully.Swedish director Lasse Hallström comes back only one year after his awarded THE CIDER HOUSE RULES, that had more dramatic power. He uses the same style here, doing a great job. No complaints. The cinematography and the sets help you to get into the climate of a fable, not to talk about the wonderful soundtrack.I've expected many years to see Juliette Binoche in action again after THE ENGLISH PATIENT and now it's rewarding to see that she's still a great actress. She is pretty, funny and can bring emotion to a character like few other actresses. Judi Dench deserved her nomination for best supporting actress. The funniest lines belong to her. Lena Olin is terrific and she shouldn't have disappeared the way she did- I still remember her astonishing performance in THE UNBEARABLE LIGHTNESS OF BEING, which also starred Binoche. As for the others, Alfred Molina, Peter Stormare and Carrie Anne Moss are effective, and Johnny Depp seems to be just window dressing.Even not being the best film of the world, I can recommend CHOCOLAT. It's a light, beautiful, lovely, feel-good, easy to watch, unpretentious film, with a bit of  romance and a bit of magic that will make your day happy. It's not unforgettable, the story is predictable and the clichés are all around but you'll want to run to a chocolate shop as the ending credits roll. Anyway, isn't chocolate irresistible? And CHOCOLAT, even not being irresistible as chocolate, is a delight to watch.",Chocolat
85,Dragoneyed363,I had never craved chocolate so much in my life!,9,14 September 2009,"When I borrowed Chocolat from my friend, I really didn't know anything about it, or really what my expectations should be (other than that it's name made me hungry and there was something that was going to be happening about chocolate somewhere in the movie, hahaha). Well, when the movie started up, I got the main concept right away and was immediately interested, which they were very satisfactory at material like that, by that I mean, they weren't trying so hard to get the point through of what they wanted you to understand, they just followed the expression, ""go with the flow"" and that definitely worked out for the unquestionable better for this movie!I immediately fell in love with Juliette Binoche's character Vianne, because they do an excellent job at establishing her character to where you really care for her and admire her, same for many of the other main and supporting characters like Josephine, Armande and Roux. This movie had amazing character structure which in the end benefited it greatly, because that is one of the things I look for in every movie, that they are able to introduce their characters with strong, effective personalities and dispositions, you understand what they are basically like right away, and magnificently all the actors and actresses were able to do that with their characters, as I have already stated and praised a couple of times; Juliette Binoche deserved an Oscar, and Carrie-Ann Moss, Johnny Depp, Lena Olin, Judi Dench, Alfed Molina etc. etc. all gave astoundingly award-worthy performances as well!Second of all, the plot is absolutely miraculous. I couldn't help but be so mesmerized and entranced by how wonderfully they were able to create this strange, but lovable atmosphere of these people, not wanting to accept change to their quiet and ""cardboard"" little town, but then something so simple as chocolate is able to turn all their perspectives on life around all at once, which is a great and true message: The simplest things sometimes can make the biggest impact, and this movie definitely showed that and handled the idea incredibly well.I love this movie, and the whole time I was watching, I had never wanted to consume chocolate so much in my life! I truly think it is really something special when a movie can just make the audience want to go out and do something or want to cooperate and or feel what the characters are feeling, and I mean that in a good sense of course, because the whole time I was watching this movie, I just wanted to experience these amazing experiences that the characters were experiencing and I even felt jealousy come over me as they obtained these opportunities!This film certainly is nowhere near bad and or mediocre in any way! It is a masterpiece! One of the best films I have ever seen, actually, no lie there! I didn't find one flaw, but it's just I do think it's one of those films where I believe there are overall a few better movies than it, and by that I mean, while this movie is breathtakingly stunning in it's whole trial, there are movies that I, surprisingly, do enjoy more. Regardless, Chocolat is a fun, beautifully crafted, completely alluring work of art from start to finish, and by the end I was astonished at how fantastic this movie really turned out to be. I recommend to anyone who loves an enthralling plot that commingles with unforgettable performances behind unforgettable characters, non-stop entertainment and a little bit of a chocolaty sweet touch here and there...",Chocolat
86,Geofbob,"Sweet, but with an aftertaste",8,5 May 2001,"I haven't read the book on which this movie is based,  so went to see it expecting little more than a love story involving chocolate, set against some beautiful views of the French countryside. I found it to be rather more serious than that. In fact, the setting in France is fairly incidental, and the film is about some basic social and ethical issues, involving tolerance and hypocrisy, at a period, the 1950s, when such issues were being actively addressed in western society, and old conventional frameworks were beginning to crumble.The movie (and the book) might have tackled this theme via a realistic drama or satirical comedy, but decided to choose the mode of a fable. The audience is left in no doubt about this, as it is signalled right at the outset when the wind, almost literally, blows confectioner Vianne Rocher (Juliette Binoche) and her daughter into town, and we flash back to her mystical origins.  I don't expect fully rounded characters in fables (especially when they avoid chocolate!), so was not offended by the fairly stereotypical collection of villagers - though they are not much more stereotypical here than in most Hollywood pictures. Much of the charm of the film is due to Binoche, whose character is not as restricted as the others, because she has a psychological depth that comes from not blindly following imposed conventions, but trying to make your own choices (and from eating chocolate!) Judi Dench as an embittered pensioner with a colourful past, and Lena Olin as a beaten wife sheltered by Vianne, fulfil their roles with merit. I am less sure about Johnny Depp, who plays a kind of gypsy (as in The Man who Cried) for some reason with an Irish accent, though his character, Roux, has a French name. (Perhaps he was allowed to get away with it because the director, Lasse Hallstrom, a Swede, didn't realise it was Irish.)The real stars are none of the above, but the irresistible, mouthwatering chocolates that appear in all shapes and sizes throughout the film. All in all, I found it a bitter-sweet confection, providing food for thought.",Chocolat
87,renaldo and clara,monumentally disappointing,4,13 January 2001,"Having seen many french movies and being french myself, I was happy to see another one of those rare moments when french actresses can take the spotlight in America. Also, I thought it was cool to have Johnny Depp in it.  But the movie is waaaaaaa-yyyyyyyy to gooey....I haven't seen <music of the Heart>, but this would probably make that look realistic. THE FILM SO-O-O INSULTS YOUR INTELLIGENCE.****SLIGHT SPOILER****
I mean, come on, a normal french guy is *not* going to fast just to show his loyalty to God, even if he's extremely religious. I'm sorry, but we French KNOW how to eat, and how to eat right! That's why you won't see any obese people in France. Besides the guy didn't look like he had been fasting for weeks.  The character of the mayor and his resisting temptation towards food was just an excuse for the movie to have a scene in the end where he gorges on delicious chocolate. 
   Also, much of what happens to the character of the abusive husband was completely pulled out of someone's ***. Really. You would not see women pointing and laughing at a guy being all dressed up, and the mayor trying to reform him by putting him in a classroom of small children. And for someone so normal as Lena Olin's character, the guy's wife played a pretty ""cuckoo"" part in the beginning. Did she suddenly see the light just because she started eating chocolate?? Whatever.   **** END  SPOILER ******This movie is extremely boring for my taste... I have no problem with comedies and romance at all! But this wasn't even very funny. I've never seen Lasse Hallstrom's <Cider House Rules>, but I think he is an old man and likes to appeal to an old audience. That's fine with me as long as I don't have to watch it.
The photography was nice, but nothing special. It made chocolate look REALLY, I mean REALLY good, and Johnny Depp looked pretty suave, but Depp always seems to suffer that 'Val Kilmer' complex of ""trying too hard to underact"".Anyway, if you're over 50, (not that THAT'S old, but) you'll most likely really like this movie. I personally would rather have seen it with a mute button so I wouldn't have to hear all those horrible, fake French accents and could just watch all the cute and stylish outfits Binoche was wearing.    There were, btw, only 2 French actors in the film; Juliette Binoche and Victoire Thivisol, the little girl who played her daughter Anouk.

93,mlevans,Hallstrom cooks up another perfect recipe,9,15 March 2003,"Aromatic, sweet, rich and flawlessly blended, Lasse Hallstrom's `Chocolat' perfectly matches the delectable treats sculpted and doled out by Juliette Binochet throughout the movie. Perhaps the most gifted director working today, Hallstrom was probably the only one who could have made this tale of a Mary Poppinseque chocolate maker a masterpiece.An exquisite piece of work, Chocolat delvers a strong message in just 121 minutes (It seems shorter.) with Hallstrom's velvet glove preventing the points he makes from stinging too badly.LIKELY SPOILERS AHEADSet in a quaint French village in 1959, a universe away from the worldly French big city life going on around it, the film begins with strong overtones of Mary Poppins. A `clever North wind' blows in not an umbrella-wielding nanny, but a chocolate-baking single mother and her young daughter. We later learn that the woman, Vianne (Binochet) hails from a long line of drifting Mayan women who dispense health and happiness through ancient magical recipes.Just like in the earlier children's movie, the North wind blows her into a fussy locale, badly in need of a breath of fresh air-and a taste of chocolate.  The village is a small, close-knit community where tradition is paramount-along with the leadership of the Catholic Church and the elected officials. Monsieur Comte de Reynaud (Alfred Molina) is mayor of the small town and is descended from the first Comte (count) de Reynaud, whose statue stands outside the church in the center of town. He takes it upon himself to rewrite sermons for youthful priest Pere Henri (Hugh O'Conor), to spread gossip and to keep unsavory elements out of town. He leads by example, fasting throughout Lint.The Comte meets his match in the strong-willed Vianne, however, as she dares open a chocolate shop during the beginning of Lint. Parishioners in this tiny village do not choose one negligible habit to dispense with during Linten season; they are expected to be abstinent even in marriage and to avoid all sweets and other forms of pleasure. As outcast villager Josephine Muscat (Lena Olin) says, those who misbehave or who fail to fit the narrowly defined roles within the community are termed `crazy' or forced out. Josephine and elderly Armande Voizin (Dame Judi Dench) are both outcasts who are reassured by the suave, confident chocolate maker. When swashbuckling river drifter Roux (Johnny Depp) and his band show up, it is more than the Comte can stand and the battle lines are finally drawn.The plot has no real surprises, yet never drags. Hallstrom weaves his spell, with just a touch of mystical magic, as that old North wind blows in from time to time and stirs things up in the tiny town. The village itself is wonderful-both in the aerial shots (models, I assume) and closer views. Looking back, I cannot remember seeing an automobile, a few of which I assume would have been seen in even the most modest village in 1959. Still, it is a most charming setting and it works quite well. Even the first Comte's statue comes into play more than once.The cast is superb. I was only familiar with Dench and Depp, prior to seeing the film. Everyone shines, though. Binochet rules the roost with a strong, appealing and very human portrayal of the sometimes-mystical sometimes-vulnerable Vianne. Strikingly attractive, her looks and tempting sweets are too much for the provincial natives. Molina is wonderful as the overbearing Comte. Every church has an elder/deacon like this. A good man at heart, he fights to suppress his own desires and heartache and expects the others to emulate his example. The protection of his idyllic village is his overriding priority. While pushy and presumptuous, Molina never crosses the line and becomes a cardboard villain.Of course it goes without saying that Dench is superb. (When has she NOT been?) As the elderly, worn-out landlady, she sparkles with her usual strength, grit and charm. She and Binochet are marvelous together. She also shines with her artistic grandson Luc, played splendidly by Aurelien Parent-Koenig.Olin makes a wonderful transformation as Josephine and delivers one of the best lines of the movie. Her drunken husband Serge (Peter Stormare) had roared, `You don't even know how to use a skillet!' while breaking into the chocolate shop to take her home. After conking him on the head with a frying pan, she proclaimed, `Who says I don't know how to use a skillet?' Depp also does good work and provides fine romantic tension with Binochet. John Wood and Leslie Caron also make a charming couple, who Vianne brings together in their twilight years. O'Conor, meanwhile, is likeable as the earnest, but inexperienced priest. A fan of American rock & roll music, despite himself, he nevertheless takes his vows seriously. He sternly lectures Wood for having prayed for God to soothe his ailing 14-year-old dog's spirit. When Wood blithely outmaneuvers him, he quickly slams the confessional door.
Perhaps my favorite Hallstrom moment is when the prim and proper widow Madame Audel sneaks a piece of candy during Mass. The crinkling of the wrapper catches many ears-especially those of the Comte, who gives her an icy stair. The camera then catches her-cool as a cucumber-innocently swallow her candy.Of course it is not hard to predict the moral that will be learned by the priest, the Comte and his stunningly attractive secretary (Carrie-Anne Moss). This hardly matters, as Hallstrom and his cast and crew's execution are virtually seamless. To paraphrase the Christopher Reeves `Superman' promos, `You will BELIEVE that a magical chocolate recipe can change lives!' Hallstrom has a way of making a believer out of us.",Chocolat

Juliette Binoche has never been a particularly good actress and her performance in this flick was no more polished or exciting than any of her previous movies.

""Chocolat"" is a very beautiful and touching movie about a single mother with a daughter who decides to open a ""chocolaterie"" in a very conservative village during Lent. What follows almost looks like a fairytale: the characters, the story, the music, the whole idea of an old conservative French village I liked the movie a lot. It has everything: a laugh, a cry, a wonderful story and some amazing acting performances. Juliette Binoche is made to play this kind of caring and sensitive women. Although Johnny Depp had a very small part in this movie, he was excellent as always. I personally think that Judi Dench gave one of her best performances in ""Chocolat"", truly great acting!

She picked it out as the synopsis seemed to fit the mood of the evening planned. Indeed it hit it right on the mark! It is a unique story of a woman and her young daughter who live a nomad life style moving from town to town where she would open chocolate shops. She flies in the face of the practices of the average folks of the time and town, but made good friends and through simple acts of kindness won over friends and helped set people free of their inhibitions. I didn't expect to like it that much but wound up loving it. We now spend a weekend evening each fall watching the movie together, enjoying the simple yet quality story that has grown to be one of our favorites.

104,Jimmy-128,"Imperfect, but charming nonetheless",8,12 February 2001,"Chocolat has its holes, but the overall package is so enjoyable and so deftly handled by its cast, one can gloss over them and not feel guilty.  I do have to address them, though, so don't read the last paragraph unless you've seen the movie.Juliette Binoche is offically forgiven (by me, at least) for stealing Lauren Bacall's Oscar.  She is a pure delight to watch as the single mother/chocolatier who has to contend with typical small-town small-mindedness.  She projects a earthy good nature that can't help but infect the people around her, both in the film and in the audience.  And did anyone else notice that her character always wore at least a little red?As for Dame Judi--well, what else can one say about Da Dench?  She's wonderful and delivers some of the film's best lines with a perfect deadpan. Anyone who grew up with as formidable a grandmother/matriarch as Armande will see her immediately in Dench's performance.Lena Olin doesn't do anywhere near enough movies for my satisfaction.  She is a truly magnificent professional and deserves serious consideration for Best Supporting Actress when Oscar time comes around.  Her portrayal of Josephine is breathtaking in its simplicity and wondrous in its complexity. Give this woman more roles!!!!I have only two problems with the movie.  First, this isn't the first town Vianne's been in, and these can't be the first people she's touched this way.  So why does she have such a hard time moving on?  Second, the ending to one of the subplots seems contrived, a mandatory ""happy ending.""  The ending is happy, and sweet, enough without adding saccharine.",Chocolat
105,dwr246,"Once upon a time, a woman opened a chocolate shop during Lent...",10,7 March 2006,"Ah, chocolate. A favorite confection of many. A passion for some. It seems to represent something a little different to each person, as this movie shows with rather delightful results.Vianne Rocher (Juliette Binoche) is a born wanderer. We see this as she recounts the tale of how her parents met to her daughter, Anouk (Victoire Thivisol). Early one spring, her wandering takes her to a small village in the French countryside, where she opens a chocolate shop. Unfortunately for Vianne, she has arrived during Lent, and the Comte de Reynard (Alfred Molina), who pretty much runs the town, has declared chocolate off limits for the Lenten season. Undeterred, Vianne sells her wares to the villagers, most of whom are soon won over by her compassion and kindness. In the process, she becomes involved in helping an abused wife (Lena Olin) out of her horrible marriage, bringing a shy elderly couple together, and reuniting a grandmother, Amande (Judi Dench) with her estranged grandson, Luc (Aurelian Parent Koenig), whose mother Caroline (Carrie-Anne Moss), secretary to the Comte, has forbidden the boy from seeing his grandmother. When a band of river gypsies led by Roux (Johnny Depp)comes to town, Vianne immediately befriends them, while the Comte declares them off limits. A violent act by an overzealous villager helps to set off a chain of events which leads the Comte to soften his stance, and eventually befriend Vianne.The writing is brilliant, weaving together subplots artfully, and creating characters that you care about. Even the villains have their humanity, while there are moments when Vianne herself is not overly sympathetic. In the end, all are presented as people, with their faults as well as their strengths.The acting is delightful. Binoche is an incredible talent, as her portrayal sows. Depp also does well here, and his chemistry with Binoche is wonderful. Dench gives her usual excellent performance. Parent Koenig does a wonderful job with his role, as does Thivisol with hers. Moss creates a wonderfully complex character, whose humanity and kindness become ever more clear as the movie goes along. Likewise with Molina, whose pompousness is a bit off-putting in the beginning, but whose transformation is delightful, as we begin to sympathize with his plight. Leslie Caron's cameo is charming. Perhaps the standout performance is Olin's however, as she goes from victim to fully developed woman in a most satisfying arc.And of course, there's the chocolate, which shows up so much throughout the movie that it almost seems to be a character of its own. You long for a morsel as you watch, and you can almost feel the satisfaction of those who eat and enjoy the chocolate.This is a delightful movie, well worth revisiting from time to time.",Chocolat
106,teejayniles2345,A sweet for those who crave light fare,10,17 August 2001,"As I reflect on the ""field of choice"" from the five nominees (Erin Brockovich, Traffic, Gladiator, Crouching Tiger. . ., & CHOCOLAT) for last year's BEST PICTURE, I now understand how it fits into such international ""company.""  The Hollywood production is best described as a sweet delicacy for those moviegoers craving light fare.  I didn't ""buy"" the fairytale framing device that the film's director wanted to give it but I withhold any specific negative criticism on that particular count since I haven't read the novel the script was based on.  It just seemed to be kind of part of a ""collage""-technique that wasn't fully effective, in my opinion.  CHOCOLAT's screenplay (based on Joanne Harris' novel) was, without a doubt, in a league far less worthy than that of the OSCAR-winner, Traffic (Stephen Gaghan who adapted teleplays, Traffick).   Speaking of movies I can unabashedly recommend to the general moviegoing public, I do want to pay credit to another USER COMMENT below (Mort-31, 4 August 2000) for reminding me of a much better (nutritious in the literal and allegorical senses) Best Picture (Foreign Film category) of a few years back: BABETTE's FEAST.  I encourage IMDB browsers to rent the two European, general audience appealing-films together and then notice how you rate this happily conceived film from your video stores on the basis of worthy comparison.  Still, I would advise those who sample CHOCOLAT not to bring too many high-brow demands given its airy, flimsy thesis once the cellophane has been unwrapped from around its bright packaging.  It's a good film for snuggling and ""taking your brain out to relax."" This ""candy box"" has giddy, happy little devices and is thoroughly restrained in contrast to most mainstream recent films in its depiction of the aphrodisiac quality inherent in the blend of cacao plus hot pepper.  It does affirm the benefit that ""outsiders"" can bring to stifled and stifling communities.  Therefore, it provides a helpful parable to many insulated American enclaves.  However, other movies have also addressed such ""fish out of water"" projects . . .Or was the film intended to enlighten American Francophobes that there are lots of adorable French folks in little villages?  If that underlies the positive angle for this movie for any potential video renter,  try the ""real thing"" when you next seek a video from the store:  a movie in French language with ""real"" French actors from lead actress throughout the cast, not this happy unsorted box of folks who for the biggest part just act French-like or homogenized European in their accents.",Chocolat
107,Philaura,It was Okay - but not Great,4,12 March 2001,"My husband made me sit through ""The Fantastiks"" the night before we went to see Chocolat and I found myself comparing the way the two films dealt with the same issue of people who follow guidelines in hopes of living a satisfactory life as opposed to the capricious that just go where the wind blows them.  I have done both and firmly believe that there are very distinct pros and cons to both roads.  I get a little upset with films that depict those that try to develop self discipline as nazi types and then promote embracing the free spirited life instead as the better way.  They smoothed it out at the end with everyone coming together, but the build up was definitely one sided.I identified much more with ""The Fantastiks"", though not nearly as well made film, the message shared more wisdom.  This simple story pointed out in order to survive the gypsy lifestyle free of rules and responsibilies one must wear a mask to hide expression of the pain that one feels and observes in others.  Lots of people get stepped on with all that expressive dancing around not looking where you are going.This film was good in lots of ways - not best picture material for me.",Chocolat
108,Wulfstan10,"Enjoyable, artistic, appealing to senses, but a little trite",8,24 March 2005,"This is effective as a sweet, enjoyable film, that addresses some relevant, even if rather well-trod, messages. Above all, the success of the film is due to the fact that it handles the themes with a rather unique, skillful, and artistic approach.The scenery and cinematography are good and artistic. The images of the town and the way in which the film shows the chocolates and their creation are effective and satisfying. The images thoroughly help create the mood and atmosphere of the film's themes, as well as the power of satisfying food.The use of chocolate in the movie is itself very appealing and fun. It provides the basis for some great visuals and is interesting as a different and effective tool with which to explore the issues in the film. This effect is all the greater because of the strong emotions and sensory stimulus that food, in particular something like chocolate, can create. Without this tool, powerful in hitting viewers' thoughts and senses, the film would have been much weaker.A number of the characters are fairly unusual and complex, with a fair amount of depth while the actors mostly do a very good job at portraying them. They thus add much to the exploration of the themes, keeping the film interesting, and the film successfully handles the development of their characters.One main problem is that sometimes the film comes across as a little too trite and sappy. The basic themes have been explored a lot over the years, which is definitely a problem on this level, and the film is hardly subtle in its handling of them. The familiar, well-worn nature of the themes, while hardly an insurmountable problem, exacerbates the preachy element of the film and combined these factors sometimes make it seem a little too over-the-top and even irrelevant.However, the film is very good overall.It succeeds because of the way in which the themes are explored and the skill in using the visuals, the role of chocolate, and the characters.",Chocolat

But it was about so much more than just the amazingly delicious-looking chocolate.Juliette Binoche is amazingly charming and enchanting, playing the lead role in this fairy tale about a woman named Vianne and her daughter who move to a repressed small town in France, and throw it into turmoil by attacking the taboos of the townspeople one by one. Binoche is stunning; she literally lights up the screen. Johnny Depp, playing opposite her, is great as usual. And Alfred Molina puts in a fantastic performance as Vianne's foil, the Comte Paul de Reynaud.Superficially, this is at once a fairy tale, a love story, and a story about chocolate. On a deeper level, it's a classic tale of conservatism versus shaking things up, of the old ways being pitted against new ideas, and of the whole question of morality itself.All of this is wrapped up in an utterly enchanting - and dare I say - delicious package.

111,the_mysteriousx,Nauseating preaching disguised in a beautiful painting,1,20 February 2001,"I gave this film a 1 out of 10 and that is for the fine technical work in it. The film does nothing but beat you over the head with a politically correct ""open your mind"" stick right from the get-go and never lets up. There is absolutely no dealing with issues. I am not a Christian, nor am I a big fan of Christianity, but I felt for them in this film because they were given little to no respect. We as the audience see the Christian characters as stupid, dull and short-tempered. Juliette Binoche's character, however, is righteous and the movie makes absolutely NO attempt to delve into her philosophy. We are supposed to accept that she is simply right and the townspeople are sleepwalking, only to be awakened by the vessel of her enlightening chocolat.Once again in a Hollywood film, Christians are characters who are single-minded and convenient foils for the open-minded and therefore correct heroes of the film. Don't get me wrong, I am not saying that either side is right, but the filmmakers don't give the traditional Christians even a voice of respect and then slap them in the face by having the Christian priest speak about how he felt they should forget about the divinity of Christ and regale in his humanity. I thought the film might bring up issues for discussion, but instead it was absolutely nothing but bull-headed, incredibly repetitive and boring.Yes, a great film to be a part of visually, but those visual gifts disguise an un-daring, bland story.

112,great_sphinx_42,Life by 'Chocolat',7,13 August 2001,"What a sweet movie. 'Chocolat' is a fun fable about a free-spirited woman named Vianne (played by Juliette Binoche), who travels wherever the north wind takes her in order to heal the troubled souls she meets up with. Her cure? Chocolate. This time, the sly wind has brought Vianne and her young daughter to a small town in rural France. The mayor of this town, Comte de Reynaud (Alfred Molina), is the latest in a long line of moral-compass types to watch over the village and its traditions. He is not bad or evil; he simply strives to preserve tranquility- but unfortunately for those who have to live there, the town's tradition of tranquility has become little more than suppression. When Vianne shows up with her aura of warm sensuality the mayor sees her as a threat, so she must strive to prove to him and those like him that there is more to live than pointless self-denial. Juliette Binoche is both a presence and a timeless beauty; she will be beautiful at 70 because it exudes from both her face and her spirit. It's really no wonder the entire town reacts so strongly to her character. Also on hand is another warm, beautiful woman: Judi Dench (who is already nearly 70) plays Vianne's landlady and friend, Armande. Lena Olin is another strong character- Josephine, at first a beaten wife and klepto, then transformed into a spirited young business woman. Johnny Depp is Roux, a handsome river-rat whose arrival is the catalyst for the film's climax. All of these characters will face temptation- the chocolate Vianne makes is an obvious metaphor. In this fable, however, temptation is not a bad thing. It's what makes life worth living.",Chocolat

They and the rest of the cast guided by Lasse Halstrom's gifted storytelling spin a captivating and delicious tale destined to be a great classic someday.

Judi Dench - well you can't really complain about her performance because it the SAME DAMN performance she always gives. Even Johnny Depp looks bad. The film is rubish. All the characters are cookie cutter version of characters in much better films. The story, so to speak, is predictable, trite and cliched. If this were directed by an American, critics would rip it apart, but since its directed by a European, with a foreign setting and an international cast, why it must be one of those charming European films about a quaint little town.

116,Alan-40,Charming beyond words,9,8 September 2001,"Although it is hard to imagine that Vianne can get an entire chocolate factory in her suitcase, along with her mother's urn and all her clothes and everything else, this is what she does. Mary Poppins was nowhere near this resourceful.  She sings few songs, but carries out her quest as a charming hobo, walking into town and establishing what amounts to a pre-franchise Starbucks.Vianne alternates between being wise and helpless, and only fleetingly loses her own sense of missionary conviction.  It is not effortless for her, because in helping her new friends find redemption, she must find it herself, even as she weaves her spells the witch hunters are never far off. And all of it in this story works.  A must see.",Chocolat

But I can't help to notice that Chocolat is a film for those who want to be ""arthouse film wannabes"" but refuse to read subtitles.  But who cares about all that when you have someone beautiful as Juliette Binoche ... I'm beginning to think that she's the real reason for all the guys to drool over, not by the chocolates!",Chocolat
118,mirkobozic,Delicious,10,26 December 2015,"I admit I'm not entirely objective when it comes to foodie movies. Being passionate about (good) food, give me a decent plot with lots of gorgeous food and it will be good in my book. But Lasse Halstrom's little confection is beyond that, still. A story of Vianne(Juliette Binoche), a single mother who moves into a quiet little French town with her daughter and opens a chocolaterie during lent upsetting the spirits in the otherwise peaceful and pious community by bringing a breeze of something different and delicious into the lives of the locals, also solving some of their problems along the way, like wife abuse, mother- daughter issues and elderly romance. However, Vianne finds her nemesis in Comte de Reynaud (Alfred Molina), the town's major who's determined to keep his community devote and away from Vianne's sinfully delicious temptations. When the river rats, headed by Roux(Johnny Depp) come along,the situation reaches its boiling point. Let's start with the (numerous) good sides of the film. The cinematography is amazing, the little town looks like it's enchanted, and Rachel Portman's wonderful soundtrack certainly supports the impression. The cast is equally impressive: Judy Dench, Juliette Binoche, Lena Olin, Afred Molina and Johnny Depp add considerable wattage to the story. Especially the delicate Binoche, who succeeds in making Vianne very life-like and sympathetic. Dench's sarcastic grandmother provides a great contrast to her boring daughter(Carrie- Ann Moss). The scene with the poetry book is almost equally Oscar-worthy as her famous ""too late"" from Shakespeare in Love. As for the weak sides of the film, the characters are structured in a very flat, b/w sort of way, and it seems their only function is embodying stereotypes (the conservative mayor, the free-thinking confectioner, the cynical old lady)and provide contrasts to each other. Do make sure you have a substantial amount of chocolate pralines while watching, otherwise it will feel like the confectionery equivalent of water-boarding. I could watch this all over again.",Chocolat
119,Brian B-2,"An enchanting parable of love, life, temptation and chocolate",10,10 February 2002,"Love, life, temptation, chocolate. What else is there really? Well, to start with, a smart balanced script. Tasteful ( or tasty?) art direction setting the variable mood tones just right, so Lasse Hallstrom's direction is unobtrusive. Best of all is the ensemble cast, hitting all the right notes whether the veterans ( Judi Dench, Leslie Caron), or child actors. Lena Olin and Johnny Depp become their roles, in the main supporting parts. Carrie-Ann Moss is totally absorbed in a small role, becoming so real she is unrecognizable to Matrix fans. Best of all though is Juliette Binoche. Seldom do we see such a sensual performance in a PG-13 film. She becomes the character, which remains a complex enigma at the heart of the story. Is she a half-Mayan witch? Or just a French single mother in 1960, in a world on the cusp of the Beatles and the 60's revolution? She is at once elemental goddess Earth mother and toasty bed warmer we all desire. Female messiah figures are rare, and hers is a treasure. Not only a great movie, but an important story.",Chocolat
120,Dilip,"Heart-warming fairy tale with enticing chocolates, lovely scenery, & endearing characters-chocolate is a gift of the gods!",7,8 January 2001,"I saw this film in the theatre on January 6, 2001.  I found it to be a simple and heart-warming story of Vianne Rocher (played by Juliette Binoche) and her mature and sweet pre-teen, Anouk (Victoire Thivisol).  Vianne has inherited a strange South American penchant to drift with the annual coming of the North Wind and set up a luscious chocolate shop in town after town. The two come in 1960 to a small, beautiful, riverside French village, and find closed-minded townsfolk, led by a mayor with an obsessive penchant to moralizing against even the pleasures of chocolate.One needs to reserve being overly analytical, in particular in trying to understand how Vianne can afford her generosity and move her business with so many supplies so frequently (though there is a quick early scene showing a truck unloading some material), but I saw the film as a charming fairy tale.  I very much enjoyed the characters - the self-assured, independent, confident, warmth-exuding Vianne; kind beyond her years Anouk, a role model for a pre-teen :-); and the fiercely individualistic ""river rat"" Roux (Johnny Depp).  Though it certainly wasn't her strongest showing, it was nice to see Judi Dench playing the part of a curmudgeonly grandmother, Amande Voizin (coincidentally, just before I had gone to the film, I saw her in two of her famous British television comedies, ""A Fine Romance"" and one of my favorites, ""As Time Goes By"").The scenery of ""Chocolat"" was lovely, as were the touches of South American pan flute music.

It brings up the age old battle of indulgence versus self-control. Complete indulgence seemed to lead the characters down a path of joyous release. I think this is a fine ideal, but hardly realistic. Moderation is always the better road to follow. I think Babette's feast did a better job of capturing the fear that their character's had of letting themselves go. The difference between the two movies was that the denial of worldly pleasures was self-imposed in BF where in chocolat it was imposed by the Count and his presence and grip over the community. It also had elements of the supernatural, very subtle, but enough to add a touch of magic to make it special. In this I am sure the comparison with ""Like Water for Chocolate"" will be made. It was it's own story though. The message at the end was was one I wished more people would get. It's by what we do that makes us good or evil, not what we deny or allow ourselves.",Chocolat

The magical, addictive, restorative, redemptive, but somehow non-fattening quality of chocolate creations whipped up on a shoestring and freely dispensed by Binoche's character, who exemplifies enlightenment, family, and pagan values at the same time and, when the going gets tough, typically lights out for the country in her, uh, red riding hood.Just say no!

It opened during Lent and was shown in English, for maximum insult-the-French value I guess, and had a mercifully short run with no great popularity (especially when compared with other anglophone films such as Chicken Run, Shrek, and Mission Impossible 2). I saw it juxtapositioned between multiple viewings of Amelie Poulain. Such a difference between the French fairy tale (told in a light, colorful if longwinded way), and the politically correct Anglo/American pseudofrench clunker. It was like the difference between breathing and watching a lecture on breathing from the viewpoint of a tree. Now that Amelie is available in the US, I am saddened to see how little attention it has drawn other than from the critics.

Suppose that, instead of the Catholic church (a comfortable, cuddly patsy if ever there was one), the opposition had been Le Pen and the French hard rightists.

The different layers of ths film are like different kinds of chocolate, bitter, sweet, milky, spicy, strong, and even melancholic. A nomad mother, a sedentary daughter, a grandson and a rebel grandmother, all different kinds of people, but united by the naive and original taste of chocolate. So, ok, blame the mayans, but I saw a peaceful place in the spinning plate, and that's where the film took me.

It pretends to be a fairly tale, but is much too shallow and narrow to be a real fairy tale. The heroine is supposedly open minded and wise, but refuses to attend church (a major custom of her new town), drags her daughter from town to town, and sleeps around rather easily. This is a wise role model?Virtually every character is a stereotype: the mayor, the oaf, the couple who need chocolate for an aphrodisiac, the oaf's wife who finds strength, etc. I also did not find the actions of the Judy Dench character to be realistic.It is anti-Catholic, and anti-Christian. It is disturbing that the authors felt the need to erect a silly ""straw-man"" image of Christianity and then knock it over. The homily the priest gives on Easter morning is absurd. No priest or minister is going to downplay Christ's divinity. Some of the posters here have written that the movie isn't really anti-Catholic, it's just against some aspects of religion. That is not right, as you can see by the relentless stereotyping.This movie is a PC propaganda piece.

The ""chocolat"" of the title is supposedly wonderful stuff: gives the user renewed sexual potency, raises their level of sensitivity, provides courage, fosters truthfulness, and helps the elderly infirm face death happily.  The poor mayor, full of stifling piety, must lose himself in an orgy of ""chocolat"" to discover his humanity. The wretched wife beater and arsonist, who NEVER HAS ANY ""CHOCOLAT"", is driven from the town.  Even 98 year old dogs (in human years of course) feel frisky enough to mount a lovely little female dog after a bit of this heavenly substance. What is the underlying thesis here?

135,matt caccamo,3 stars,4,13 January 2001,"`Chocolat' is a fairy-tale's fairy tale: sweet and wondrous with a message worth the price of admission.	 The film is set in a 1950s French countryside town.  This is one of those towns from the `old days' where everyone knows everyone else and they all seem to like it like that.  It's also a town founded on its `traditions,' and God forbid anyone try to upset those traditions.  While most of the townspeople play out their lives according to a prescribed morality and religious adherence, it's the towns mayor, Reynaud (Alfred Molina), who keeps the town in line.  The rest go through the motions, waiting for something to knock them off the traditional route. 	That something comes along in the arrival of Vianne (Juliette Binoche) and her daughter Anouk.  They are wanderers and, by family tradition, roam from town to town healing people with their many chocolate treats.  This French town they've stumbled upon is both the best and worst place for them: it's a town in nead of some healing, but, at the same time, a town resilient to change and strangers. 	The relationship between these newcomers and the traditional French town is as sweet as the chocolate Vianne sells.  Everyone is nice is this film, even the supposed `bad guy' mayor.  But that's alright; it's a fairy tale after all.  It picks up more steam with the arrival of Irish `river rat' Roux (Johnny Depp), who forms a friendship and love interest with Vienne. 	Director Lasse Hallstrom, who has a wonderful ability to portray small-town life, brings us a film that encourages opening up to life's passions without condemning those who haven't yet.  That is the beauty and simplicity of `Chocolat.'  Just like its digestible title, it's delicious.",Chocolat

The acting was awful, nearly from top to bottom and that includes Juliette Binoche.  Only Judi Densch was good.  Johnny Depp was useless, both his performance and the character.  There was zero chemistry between he and Binoche.  Did anyone care that they were making love on the boat?  Did anyone care when he left?  Did anyone care when he returned?  I didn't even care when the boats went up in flames, it was all so contrived.This was a film with an identity crisis.  Half of it wanted to be a cute and charming farcical comedy, and the other half wanted to be a deep and moving drama.  It did neither well (it probably would have been better had it gone the farce way).  All of the characters were stereotypical and cliched charicatures.  This film had no soul; it was the Disney of movies, the McDonalds of European film and the fact that it got an Oscar nomination is a testament to how corrupt the Oscars are and how the only thing that really matters is how much lobbying the studio does and whether the film is an ""oscar kind of film"".  Do these people even watch the movies they nominate and vote for?I won't even go into the accents other than to say that despite some humourous scenes in the film, the varied and ridiculous accents in the film were the funniest thing in the movie (unintended of course).

A single mother and her ten year old daughter come into a small French town carrying suitcases.  It's a blustery storm and they are wearing red capes with hoods.  The church is full of sad-faced penitants and the congregation is reminded that it is Lent, and they are to sacrifice as Christ, the Lord sacrificed, so that God's children could be free of (original) Sin.The people are downhearted and desolate to begin with, and can hardly be expected to deny themselves further.  The mayor, a religious fanatic, attempts to control the morality of the townspeople by imploring the new young priest to preach self-abnegation.  Caught off-guard, the young priest is singing, ""You ain't nothin' but a houn' dog,"" which is a hint of what is to come.By some miracle the woman and her daughter clean up a dirty, cobwebbed shop and open up a patisserie featuring chocolate, every variety you can imagine. The mayor is outraged and promises to drive her out of town.  He spreads rumors that she is evil and her daughter, illegitimate.  It comes out that they are constantly on the move, and the girl wants to settle down.  The mother has Mayan artifacts and brings in a sense of the exotic.  Instead of the forbidden fruit, it is chocolate.She gives away samples.  Huge stores of chocolate are delivered from some unknown source.  The woman is young, beautiful and always smiling, displaying a disarming self-confidence despite being strangers in the town and viewed with suspicion.Soon the samples begin to have their effect.  People are smiling.  Some have a whimsical aphrodisiac effect.  More and more people come to the store and taste her wares.  The mayor is outraged and is determined to drive her out of town, believing that these tempting sweets are the exact opposite of what is expected during Lent.There are numerous subplots of pain and change as the chocolates seem to captivate the townspeople.  Breaking rules seems to be the order of the day.

I swear,as this man gets older,he gets better at his craft! It's a small part, but mr.depp,as always, manages to embrace the character and make him lovable. I do recommend this movie,although, it does kind of start off a little slow,but don't lose heart. I mean,it takes many licks to get to the center of a lollipop,but brother,is it worth it.",Chocolat

But even so: isn't it a mere compilation of appealing motives that are thrown away in a rude manner? First of all: the main theme - challenging and changing things through the seduction of taste senses - is 'stolen' from the wonderful Swedish movie ""Babette's Feast"", a movie where it appears handled in a much more subtle, philosophical way. Then: do we really need EVERYTHING leading to a Happy End? Wouldn't it be much more convincing if we saw the main character (Binoche) LEAVE again the village, drawn by her inherent spirit? And do we really need to see the unbelievable return of Johnny Depp? And wouldn't it be enough with the liberation of SOME of the villagers; has it to be EVERYBODY? And... I could continue for hours. In summary: a disappointing fairy tale with some charming moments, not justifying all the fame and talks about it.",Chocolat
151,strangie,Like melted Chocolat - a little bit gooey and sweet,8,15 February 2001,"Chocoholics beware - if you are in therapy to wean yourself off eating this marvellous invention, do NOT see this movie.The story follows Vianne Rocher, Juliette Binoche and her daughter, Anouk who literally blow into a staid, stifling town during lent in the 50's. Renting out the unused paterisserie the the apartment above from Armande Voizin, Judi Dench, Vianne and Anouk set up a Chocolaterie.  They meet bitter opposition in setting up the Chocolaterie by the local big wig, moral guardian and feared mayor, the Comte de Reynaud, Alfred Molina, who is battling his own personal dilemas.  I won't go too much into what happens as some of the plot would be revealed, possibly spoiling your enjoyment of this film.You meet some delightful characters, including the young priest who has a penchant for rock and roll, in a time when it was still deemed morally wrong to have such inclinations, the tired downtrodden wife whose life gets far more interesting when her husband discovers Vianne's delightful chocolat and some not so nice characters like the local cafe owner who routinely beats his wife played by Lena Olin (who, incidently is also wife of the director of the film, Lasse Hallstrom), unbeknownst to the villagers.At times this sweet film goes overboard with niceness and eagerness to please, but for the most part it is a balanced film, with a little bit of romance, humour and morals to keep you entertained. If you are a Johnny Depp fan (which I am) you might be dissapointed with the screen time given to his character (or not given as the case is), but apart from that I highly recommend this film.  I also recommend you either have a large meal before seeing it, or have a decent swag of chocolate in your possession to scoff during it!",Chocolat

Not even to see Johnny Depp.Among the problems - things from the book were changed without reason and in a way that detracted from the brilliant imagery and plot(why the Mayor and not the Priest?!).

154,john-3109,A life more magical,9,16 April 2006,"Lasse Halstrom's (2000) film of Robert Nelson's screenplay is based on the novel by Joanne Harris. It is set in a small French town sometime just after The Second World War.It's an unusual tale of people who, in their different ways, are trapped by their own fixed and immutable beliefs and seem helpless to overcome them on their own. Also, they are poorly led by Comte de Reynaud (Alfred Molina) who is both mayor and an intrusive, meddling patriarch. He lives a subtle public lie that his wife is travelling in Italy, when really he alone knows for sure that she has left him and he has no idea how to deal with his inconsolable loss.But through the arrival of some unexpected visitors by fairytale from the outside world, the lives of almost everybody in the village is transformed for the better.First to arrive - blown in by the north wind - are Vianne Rocher (Juliette Binoche) and her fatherless daughter Anouk (Victoire Thivisol). Rather miraculously, she opens the old patisserie into a chocolate shop. It is let to her by an elderly lady Armande Voisin (Judi Dench) who is estranged from her daughter Caroline (Carrie-Ann Moss) and her grandson Luc (Aurelien Parent Koening) during the last days of her life.Somehow, once the shop is opened, it becomes a kind of alternative medicine to the people who live in the town. Cocoa-based confectionery is seen on the face of it to be the work of the devil, by Comte de Reynaud, who enlists divine assistance (and suborns a young and impressionable priest) to suppress this ungodly and subversive delight to which he is no more immune than the others.While the village is fighting to reconcile its craving for chocolate with its righteous duty to Roman Catholicism, another spiritual evil - playing slide guitar - is washed downstream by the current. What are pirates to Anouk and are a dark immoral influence to Comte de Reynaud, is pretty much just what the doctor ordered for Vianne.Roux (Johnny Depp) and his motherless daughter have been living the same itinerant lifestyle as the manacled choclateer. Rescuing battered wife Josephine Muscat (Lena Olin) along the way and giving Armande Voisin the going-out party she's always dreamed about, Vianne is released from her own wanderings when her mother's ashes go up in a final puff of smoke.This is a interesting film in which almost everybody lives happily ever after. It is built on the confused logic of a child's thinking, but is filmed without giving away what it is that makes the thought process of adults beyond the comprehension of their children, while leaving their understanding of their emotional situation quite transparent.And we're left pondering the age old question. Chocolate.. is it really a force for evil.. or a force for good ?",Chocolat

There's not much to it, but it's put together so charmingly and the actors do such a solid job, that you end up not minding that it spends perhaps a minute too long at the end spelling out what its lesson is. If you can forgive this little flaw, then it's a pleasant enough 2 hours. The ensemble acting is wonderful (recognize the very scary dude from ""Fargo""?), and Rachel Portman's music is perfect, as usual.

Binoche, Olin, Dench, and Molina all are good in their parts. But there is something I don't buy about chili powder and chocolate mixed together for a life-changing confection.Molina plays the self-righteous, controlling mayor--who, by the power of chocolate, changes his hypocritical ways. Yes, if you don't take the movie too serious and view it as a fairy tale, a myth, then it may have all been possible.The time period of the movie was also troublesome for me. Is it in the '60s? When I see Binoche's outfits or Depp's ponytail, I think the time period is now. When I see the stone cobbled streets of the village, I start to believe that it is all taking place at the turn of the century. I guess we get that is suppose to be ""timeless.""Of course, Chocolat has all the clichés of a typical chick flick/woman's movie. Olin's abuse plot line is resolved neatly and quickly. And, as everybody knows, a woman's movie must have someone die by the ending of the movie. It doesn't take a genius to figure out who the Grim Reaper is going to visit in this one.My biggest complaint is Johnny Depp. A good actor? I just don't see it. I wanted to cut off his ponytail and tell him to give up on his in-and-out Irish accent. I just keep thinking about his teen heart throb years in ""21 Jump Street."" Why is he in movies that I think would be good like From Hell, Blow, and Sleepy Hollow?",Chocolat
157,vivesi-1,Defense of a Food Group,7,18 September 2002,"After reading some of the comments here, I felt compelled to defend this movie, even though it wasn't great. There are movies out there which are just comfort food and chocolate isn't a minor comfort food. It offers no nutrition, no value at all except for the pleasure in the moment of experiencing it and the memory of that experience. Chocolat is just that kind of film. It's sweet, pretty and life-affirming. That so many have bashed it for being anti-Catholic are short-sighted. It is anti-religion. Of course I'm kidding. Who cares what a simple movie with a singular purpose of entertainment says about anything important? Treat serious movies with serious anger and treat entertainment with a cup of cocoa. One reviewer compared it to the Breaking the Waves and that comparison blew my circuits. It's like comparing That Girl to Anna Karenina.

Every scene suffused with warm Hallmark-card hues, every character completely predictable -- the crotchety old woman with a saucy past, the timid wife whose husband beats her, the sweet old bachelor too shy to court the war widow.  All the actors in this awful travesty -- Juliette Binoche, Judi Dench, Johnny Depp, even the cute little dogs -- have done far better work, which ""Chocolat"" is obviously trying to cash in on.In short, a good date movie -- if your date just happened to have had a lobotomy.

That may be the first time that has ever happened for me -- actually generating a supreme dislike for the protagonist that I was supposed to like.  I will now avoid all Juliette Binoche Oscar-nominated films because this one, along with English Patient, is not only overrated but painful to sit through.Now that I got THAT vent out of my system, I am SO tired of these blatant anti-religion movies that attempt to disguise themselves as something else. This is NOT a charming fable that uses religion as its backdrop.  Rather, it is an anti-religion (Catholicism) manifesto that disguises itself as a charming (and is THAT ever debatable) fable. Nothing is subtle and the characters are either annoyingly cloying or downright boring.If you are going to make an anti-organized religion movie, do it with gusto and make a STATEMENT as well, as Lars von Triers did with the brilliant Breaking the Waves.  That movie was indeed anti-organized religion, but it was also a movie about the power of FAITH.I know I strayed from the subject, but I had to do ANYTHING to allow myself to forget about this horrible movie for a couple minutes.",Chocolat

The photography was superb, the acting terrific, especially the radiant Juliette Binoche.  Judi Dench, Alfred Molinaro, Johnny Depp and Lena Olin all are excellent as well.  In the movie, Binoche is a single mother in post World War France who changes a town when she opens a chocolate store. Molinaro, the town's mayor immediately begins to undermine her, seeing her as a threat, and she struggles for acceptance and changes the whole fabric of the town and the people in it.  I've seen many cynical comments about Chocolat, but for those who want an enjoyable 2 hour movie experience in this day and age, I would recommend this movie highly.  I definitely was not bored, and I didn't miss the lack of swearing and explosions.   One warning, Chocoholics Beware!",Chocolat

""Chocolat,"" on its own terms, then: a simple folktale about a mother and daughter compelled by their family legacy to wander from town to town, sharing love (in this case, symbolized by chocolate with a special ingredient) and bringing hope to people.  It's a film about freedom, about inclusiveness, about release.  The sheer beauty of every aspect of the film had me in tears, and I bought the sound track immediately after leaving the theater.  I had to let go of expecting the characters to have complicated motives; again, this is a simpler film than that.  I could relate to it, and I'm certain I'm not the only one.

Most of the time though she is speaking ?French though but this time she's speaking English. She really does everything in this movie well but its not only her in it of course. All the other characters are very well played. I can't think of one exception with the stand-out performers being, IMHO the Mayor and Serge' wife as well as the little girl. The movie did not really have any huge incredible highlights it just did everything very very well and was consistent. It also held you very well. Plenty happened in that 2 hours but the pace is just right. The story was very good and well written I enjoyed it and found it to be mostly real. Then there was the chocolate. Really if there was one unbelievable thing in the film it was the effect that Juliet' chocolate had on everyone. WOW I mean it was hilarious watching more and more people fall into total dependence on this stuff after only one crumb. But hey they were sceptical to. I also enjoyed Johnny Depp although he comes on in the later part of the film he still gets plenty of time and I think besides his occasionally off accent was pretty good.

I didn't get a chance to see it before the awards were presented.  When none of the awards materialized, I lost interest in seeing it.  About a year later, I rented it and discovered why it is a good, but not great movie.  The antagonist is more memorable than the protagonist.Yes, Vianne, the proprietor of the chocolate shop, is strikingly beautiful and she is the one who moves the plot along, but it is Alfred Molina as the mayor of the tiny town in the south of France whom I remember most.He tries to keep his town faithful to God and is not interested in anyone stirring things up.  He is the epitome of the religious and business establishment in the town.  When the town gets a new priest, the mayor takes the new priest under his wing, even writing homilies that best suit the style of the town.  Unlike many establishment figures in other movies that celebrate individuality, the mayor is not scripted as a hypocrite or a fascist.  He desperately wants the town to be as faithful to God as he is. He shows his piety throughout the movie such as private fasting through the season of Lent.  In the end, it is the priest who points out to the mayor and others that deprivation and fasting is not the exclusive path to God.Although several other characters, including Vianne herself, make transformations through the course of the movie, their changes seem bland or overused (e.g., the doormat wife becomes an independent person).

Some terrible directorial choices is the answer:(1) chosing English for a film set in a French village. The film just does not sound right in English: the images one associates with the words call up English towns, English preachers, English landlords, English food and English customs. If you want to use English, why not locate the tale in say Catholic Ireland. (2) lack of originality: once Johnny Depp has introduced a parallel to the notion of a stranger upsetting the conservative patterns of a village, merely to provide a romantic backdrop for Juliette, everything not only becomes preachy but also quite predictable. The final scene with a whole village celebrating Easter together with vagabonds and gypsies is banal in the extreme and so is the priest's message of tolerance, however praiseworthy in itself.

The story of unwed mom and daughter running a small-town chocolate factory is welcome although they are not with the townspeople, at least not at first.

170,thomasdosborneii,Irresistable,10,17 August 2001,"This delicious, enticing fable is, in my opinion, broadly about the battle between the abundant pleasures of nature and artificially-imposed, dogmatic thought systems that fear nature and its power and use a form of civilization as an attempt to keep nature at bay (where the mere fact of being born in a body is to be born in sin).  But just as the winds blow in the seeds that can take root and ultimately reclaim structures that have become crystalized (I'm thinking, for example, of how the jungle in Cambodia completely overtook the abandoned temple of Angor Wat), the revitilizing spirit of Veanne blows into an insular French village and sends tendrils of sensual pleasure into the lives of the people, breaking apart completely the stone and mortar that had been keeping the spirits of the villagers in a Dark Age prison.Just like when men get together to drink beer or housewives attend a ""kaffeklache"" (I have no idea how to spell it), it is the ""klache"" that is the point, not the ""kaffe""; chocolate was the enticement and the bonding agent for the much-needed revitalized human relationships that the chocolate, in the expert hands of its practitioner, Veanne, could engender. And what an enticement the chocolate was, with its deep powers that almost seem like magic, yet the true magic was the spirit and heart of Veanne who dispensed the chocolate like a prescription and was following a mysterious thread of nature and a spiritual commitment to bring with the wind these seeds of healing.  ""This is your favorite,"" Veanne would say, secure in her ability to see the cherished desires that resided hidden in each person's heart.  And in her hands, this was like a Tibeten prayer and a greeting: ""I recognize and salute the greatness that is within you.""  Only with the fluid complexity of ""Roux,"" Veanne's love interest who was also an unsettled spirit like her, was it harder to uncover or to realize what was the dream in both of their hearts, to find out what was ""his favorite"".  I know with names like ""Roux"" (a complex blending of flavors) and ""the Compte de Reynard"" (a ""fox""), there was some hidden communication in the marvelous names that makes me regret that I don't know French better.Veanne is like an elemental plant spirit; she carried on her journeys practically no possessions, and yet, upon alighting on fertile ground, some imprint within her would react with the soil and environmental elements to produce seemingly from nowhere a complete and beautiful chocolate shop overflowing with preColumbian artifacts and an infinite variety of chocolate treats in every shape of candy, drink, cake, or other form imaginable--indeed, a veritable jungle of chocolate emerging from out of only two seed-pod suitcases.One amazing and ironic undercurrent in the film's battle between Catholic morality and the natural, perhaps pagan pleasures was symbolized by the chocolate itself.  Chocolate did not exist in Europe prior to the discovery of the New World in 1492.  It was one of the many transformative agricultural products discovered and brought back to the Old World as a result of the Spanish invasions that intended to plunder gold and Catholicize the native inhabitants.  Here, now, the chocolate comes in like a form of Montezuma's revenge, invading a Catholic stronghold to retake the natural spirit and, as a form of commerce, get THEIR gold--the chocolate shop was a business, after all.  So, what goes around, comes around, as the North Wind might say.Among all the beautiful details in this movie, and the movie was as much of a visual a feast as the chocolate that was in the shop, one of my favorites was the fascinating color of Veanne's hair, which I can only describe as ""chocolate mixed with chili peppers,"" a rich, delicious brown mixed with red.  Whoever was the design genius who came up with that exact shade of hair dye deserves a special award--she or he captured completely the flavored essence of the story.  Hair artificially colored for ""vanity"", a ""work of the devil"", for sure, reflective of the energetic, fiery overtones lying in wait among the sweet allure of the chocolate itself.  Without even knowing what Veanne was about, the Mayor probably took one look at her and immediately began to sweat.  Heat and fecund passions arose in him that only the cold shower of abstinence could combat. Is this a battle he could win? Chocolate...who can resist it?",Chocolat

The background story with its faux-mysticism is kitschy, and I don't understand why Binoche's cheesy trick with her rotating ceramique plate does not immediately drive everyone from the shop on whom she tries it.

It is a delectable mixture of ""The Scarlet Letter"" and ""Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory.""  The message is a good balanced exhortation toward goodness and commitment without legalism and rigidity.  ""I think we can't go around measuring our goodness by what we don't do,"" it reminds.    The initially mysterious, fairy tale feel is Burtonesque (""Edward Scissorhands"").  Even when the mysterious element is eventually unveiled and the ""strange stranger"" turns out to be little more than a nice lady who likes to travel, we are not let down.  Juliette Binoche is delightful and her best attribute is that even she doesn't have it all figured out.  Her change of heart in the movie keeps it from being sappy.  Peter Stormare (Fargo, Jurassic Park 2), as Serge, is an interesting character as well. It's a shame he is disposed of and never to be seen again.  Though hardly likable, he was an interesting character and I felt he deserved a little bit more attention. Finally, though I'm a big Johnny Depp fan, I didn't think his character was particularly memorable.  Even this has its benefits, however.  Not only does Depp have the guts to be in some pretty quirky movies but he doesn't have to steal the show every time, either.  We already know he's good.And one last thing that must be said.  I did find ""Chocolat"" to be agonizingly slow.  Perhaps this is just me.  I still enjoyed it but (as with a good but over-long church service) checked my watch a lot.I think you will enjoy it, however.  Just make sure to combine it with some real chocolate.

But it's all been done before - magic stranger arrives in town, changes people's lives, falls foul of the local patriarchal repressor, everything builds to a happy ending in a warm sentimental glow.

There's a certain amount of lazy assumption as well; just like cheesy action movies, the right mix of ingredients will always attract genre fans regardless of quality. Fair enough, but this is not a classic. It doesn't take any risks, plays to a formula, and ultimately, it's a low-fat confection - tastes fine, but you don't carry it with you.",Chocolat
177,gospodinBezkrai,an apology of outplacing different civilisations,3,15 April 2006,"This could be a film about the clash of the modern liberal culture with the traditional patriarchal society, in this case an oldish catholic village in rural France in the 50s. A contemporary reading could be the clash with the conservative Muslim countries in the Middle East that we witness today. The portrayal of such process that is affecting the lives of millions of people around the world (practically all traditional societies face this challenge as they are stripped off their isolation) as so a small and innocent story - the arrival of a chocolate-maker in a peaceful village - I thought - was a brilliant idea!However by the end of the film I wasn't at all sure if the author was that deep.Great films question the default values of their societies - sometimes showing us how ridiculous they (we) are, sometimes bringing them down with hammers, sometimes reinforcing them at the end but not before a critical examination. Chocolat was clearly not a great film. It turned out to be yet another western self-glorifying story showing controversial issues very one-sidedly and neatly resolved, disguising propaganda (that of political correctness) as objectivity. Just the kind of films that Oscars like, indeed.Chocolat had simple and clear message - liberal is better than religious, those freed become happier (enjoy chocolate, sex, equal rights, etc). On the other hand Catholics are xenophobic, hypocrites, oppressing their wives. The issue of why is missing. They are i) simply bad/stupid/manipulated people, or ii) motivated in the meagre ways that a non-religious viewer could imagine, in this case - holding in power. This is bound to offend any viewers who understand motivation coming from a different perception of the world.Any great film on this topic made in a liberal country, has to ask ""are we right to believe that we are superior to others?"", has to show us the event as the other side feels it, the side we are never compassionate with and we feel justified to go and change.(the oppressed, the zealots, the backward, the non-democratic). Just as the great film from a non-liberal country questions the zeal, oppression, etc. of its society. Unfortunately the liberal countries are far behind in both courage and open-mindedness in film-making compared with those we look down upon.",Chocolat

But I decided to see this film after the Oscar nominees for ""Best Picture"" were announced, and thus my expectations were quite high. I was rather let down. It's a sweet film and the photography is beautiful, but it lacks real depth and substance. The story is predictable and rehashes familiar themes we saw in several superior films a few years back (e.g. ""Like Water For Chocolate"", ""Antonia's Line"", ""Life is Beautiful"", etc.). It's also too long. Alfred Molina gets too much screen time- I found him downright annoying and kept wanting to fast forward through his scenes. Carrie-Anne Moss is nice to look at, but underused.

It made me hungry, happy and utterly at home in the mysterious and yet somehow familiar landscapes and plot lines that the author creates for the audience to enter. The writing is almost poetic and the characters are all completely believable and true to type. The chocolate shop is not a shop at all, but rather a metaphor we are all drawn into.

184,Anaisnine,Left a sour taste....,6,11 March 2002,"First off the good points: The chocolate looked wonderful, and anytime one can see Judy Dench onscreen is a reason to be happy. But thats where it all ends. In a word the film was cliched to the gils, trite beyond belief and consequently rendered utterly charmless. Now, it may be perhaps that I've been spoiled by other 'food' films like Eat Drink Man Woman, Babette's Feast(brilliant film) and Like WAter for Chocolate...but there was just something missing from Chocolate that prevented it from endearing itself to me. I think I know what it is...this film felt far too self- concious..as if the actors and directors went around with this thougt in the back of their heads "" we are making a charming , sentimental film filled with characters tat you love to love and we will make you love us too"".  The film started out interesting enough, but once teh 'stock' characters got introduced, it was a barage of one cliche and one plot 'twist' after another . In the end it wasnt a question of how it would end..we all knew how, but rahter of which hackneyed method of execution of the given ending would be employed..not a good sign.  In all, I felt this was a horribly contrived film, self-righteous and heavy handed in its 'french charm'. If I were french, Id be offended by this film , and then I'd go rent Babette's Feast again to see a truly moving, charming film..even though it did have a 'sentimental' plot.

185,rex-10,Some may think it's sweet... wasn't rich enough for me,5,8 January 2001,"I agree with the earlier comment of another viewer, if you are caught up in anger over paganist themes, get over it and just watch the film... (but I will make an additional comment on this subject below.)  Somehow Chocolat left me unsatisfied.  It wasn't terrible, but it was hardly magical, despite striving to be.    Maybe my seat was uncomfortable, or I was restless, or guilty from playing hooky... but this show, though it had nice sets, great actors and nice scenery in a French gothic town, just was never able to win me over.  I really wanted to enjoy it, but some of the stuff was so forced.  It was simply not compelling.  For Hallstrom, this missed the 'judge not' theme of `Cider House Rules' by a wide margin.  The `Christ taught acceptance, not exclusion' theme in Chocolat was so heavy handed, it became tiresome.  In fact, if anyone is under siege from anyone, it is the Catholic Church from all the neopaganism that is so hip today in pop culture.  On the other hand, it is sad that anything that is considered 'occult' by the current standard is immediately met with opposition by the American bible belt.   Maybe the international cast of characters were having a hard time understanding the director or each other...  Again, I wouldn't dissuade you from seeing it, it just didn't work for me.  I love Juliette Binoche & the other actors.  Unfortunately, I just don't think this is their best.The girl who plays the daughter was the actress who played ""Ponnet"".  (A film which I highly endorse, it is very worth seeing. Perhaps it is easier to be 'wrangled' as a baby/toddler than as a pre-teen.) 
Alfred Molina seems to be somewhat type-casted playing a similar character as Mellersh in ""Enchanted April,"" only somewhat more uptight.  Too bad.  At any rate the depth of each character seemed lacking compared to the human-ness found in Cider House rules.  If there is anything worth promoting in film it is the nature of being human.",Chocolat

But, although traditional, ""Chocolat"" stills an original story. And ""one taste is all it takes"" to like this delicious motion picture.There are plenty of sweets to be delighted in ""Chocolat"": the story by itself, its original score and art direction, Judi Dench's performance; and the magnificent, and wonderful, and pretty Juliette Binoche, whose character, Vianne Rocher, is also part of a tradition and should be set free.

I accept that audacious hedonism can be contrasted with moral zealousness, but does it have to be presented in such a simplistic and superficial way? This was like getting a synthetic cool drink, where a glass of matured wine would have been possible. If you are a critical viewer, and want to see a film about non-conformists battling it out against the system they are caught up in, rather see ""Before Night Falls"".

Beautifully shot, smartly directed, and well acted, what more can you possibly ask? No wonder the Oscar nominees. This has all the fine materials for making a memorable movie. Chocolat? You will beg for more.Set in 1960's at a small town in France, this is the story of Vianne (Juliette Binoche) and her 6 year old daughter, a couple that are destined to move from one city to another through the country. As she settles in yet another new town, she opens another chocolate shop - an act not appreciated by the Mayor and his followers. However her warm personality and incredible chocolates manage to win over many people. But things change dramatically as a group of river drifters lead by Roux (Johnny Depp) settle by the town. Vianne welcomes them, and becomes friends with Roux, leading to even more anger from the Mayor. He is totally against them, he fears they will change his people. The struggle continues but how will it end? Elements of Religion, Human Naure, Life+Death, Sympathy, brutality, and fear -- among others -- will appear as you watch, but still this will remain as sweet as ... chocolat! Great performances from Juliette Binoche & Alfred Molina, the rest of the cast are also brilliant. Director Lasse Hallström offers a poetic film that is worth all the appreciation and critical acclimation its getting.Recommended? It surely is. You will love it.  See ...

199,overcaffeined,Bitter manifesto without spirituality.,4,22 July 2002,"Chocolat is a movie built as an anti-Catholic manifesto. It has been conceived with a strong political/religious message that affects everything in the picture. There's some paradox, though: The non-Catholic people tend to find it more anti-Catholic than Catholic spectators themselves, because some acts the movie condemns are indeed condemnable (and not worthy of true practitioners), resulting in a somewhat constructive message (but be warned that it's very unlikely that this was the real will of the authors, given the lack of any idea of spirituality within the film).Apart from that, the film shows a high quality level.

Nothing really comes along to enrich that message; everything potters along quite pleasantly to the obvious ending.I didn't find this dislikeable (apart from the irritating accents - the m'sieurs and madames etc were pretty objectionable, until I kind of mentally blocked them out, but the worst was probably the American kiddies in the Sunday School who had no ability/made no attempt to sound the least bit French) but I didn't find it superb either. There are so many other films that have done this kind of thing better.The sudden and quite absurd changes in personality that some of the characters underwent didn't seem to me to make sense in the context of the film. If it had been a bit more bizarre in general these unreal plot devices may well have been more believable.My best recommendation for this film would be, if the mild sex scenes were removed, as a kind of slightly more mature 'Madeline' for kids, or perhaps young teenagers.

202,repulsion,A simple trifle,1,3 December 2000,"Vianne Rocher (Juliette Binoche) is a woman on a mission, opting to spend her life liberalizing the lives of the inhabitants of small French towns. Daughter in tow, she sets up chocolate shops and single-handedly brings down prudishness once her stodgy neighbors get a taste of her sweet, homemade chocolate delights. An opening voice-over reminds us that this is a fable and as long as the film stages its simple-minded tale within the confines of fairy tale devices it is mostly smooth sailing from there.Lasse Hallstrom's mistake is that he bolsters his film's light-natured facade with a feeble attempt at giving the film a significantly serious moral thrust. It's the kind of plot that writes itself: conservative religious town finds the chocolate-peddling ways of the godless new citizen to be sacrilegious but by film's end everyone has learned to find that joy that lies within the cocoa seed. The film begins to take itself so seriously that one is forced to wonder if Hallstrom actually believes his material is controversial in nature.Perhaps my general indifference to the film has something to do with my utter dislike for chocolate. Even though the substance always manages to look heavenly when glorified on the screen, I find it very hard to watch it portrayed as a potential aide to achieving sexual orgasm. Once Vianne's first customer manages to unlock the secret to her husband's long-repressed sex drive, via the chocolate truffles that soulfully correspond to her persona, all remaining townsfolk find themselves slowly submitting before Vianne's offerings.It's never really clear why Vianne gets so upset when she is treated poorly by the town's citizens. In light of the fact that her work history is based on spreading the liberating love of chocolate throughout prudish towns, why would one town's hesitancy be anymore troubling than another's? The great Lena Olin plays a battered wife named Josephine Muscat who seeks refuge from her husband (Peter Stormare) in Vianne's shop, soon becoming Vianne's assistant. In what has to be one of the most unbelievable character arcs ever portrayed on screen, Hallstrom has us believe that Josephine is capable of going from kleptomaniac and paranoid schizophrenic to upstanding feminist at the snap of one's finger.I have always viewed Alfred Molina as that special kind of actor who manages to creep into otherwise forgettable film projects when a director is itching for prestige, ala James Woods and Armin Mueller-Stahl. Molina has a meatier part in Chocolat then we usually see him in, playing the town's mayor and Vianne's moral opponent. He is the staunch supporter of uptight religiosity and makes it his mission to single-handedly drive Vianne out of the town. He's the savage beast that will undoubtedly be tamed by film's end.Abortion was the hot-button issue in The Cider House Rules where Hallstrom wove a manipulative tale around Tobey Maguire's journey to pro-choice enlightenment. Here the issue is patriarchal religion and, although I am a proud agnostic, I find Hallstrom's approach to be condescending and trivializing, as if religiosity is inherently comical in it's staunch inhospitality, curable through a little bit of self-indulgence.Binoche, bearing a striking resemblance to Julia Roberts in many of the film's scenes, is good in the film despite playing second fiddle to the chocolate that she hawks. Judi Dench is one of many actors with thankless parts, playing the role of the diabetes-afflicted martyr who opts to live her final days full of chocolate instead of insulin. The entire film is innocent in nature until it turn's manipulative when Johnny Depp's pirate character enters the scene and one is left to wonder if Hallstrom is going to have the entire town construct concentration camps in order to punish the undesirables. It's a film that takes itself entirely too seriously for a comedy and seems to beg that we be shocked by how scandalous it thinks it's being.",Chocolat

Alfred Molina has been one of my favorite actors, ever since I watched him in ""Not without my daughter"" with Sally Fields back in 1991.

Every single one of them is a star! Juliette Binoche is incredibly charming and her chemistry with Johnny Depp is as addictive as chocolate.The location is superb as it should, since it's a real village in the South of France, the music is beautiful and haunting at times, but not intrusive. The plot is good even if it's a bit predictable: the priest under the thumbs of the mayor and all the town's prejudice, the grandmother who is forbidden to spend time with her grandson because of the daughter's insecurity, the battered wife, etc, etc. But it all works out very nicely in the end with the town finally accepting the atheist lady and her perverse sweets, the return of the hunk, aka Johnny Depp and the wind, which is another caractor in the story... in other words, all lived happily ever after!",Chocolat

Its a village of devout Christians observing their fasts during the time of lent. Vianne Rocher plays the single mother of a child, who moves from one village to another. why? its another story that ties to Central America, Mayans, and Chocolate (btw, you should try Venezuelan chocolate, if you haven't. Its a delicious evil.). Ahem. So the main story deals with the chocolaterie Vianne opens at this time and the narrow minded Mayor who vows to kill her business by the end of Lent, when Easter comes.On the one hand the Mayor tries to portray Vianne as the evil and tries to spread slander about her. On the other hand, some of the villagers are drawn to her chocolaterie due to her charming demeanour, kind heart, and of course sweets! One of the important customers to her shop comes for the aphrodisiacal chocolates with its magical and unbelievable effects.The story takes a turn with the arrival of a group of river drifters, led by Roux. The stereotypical image of these amongst the villagers is that of an evil group of people that have ""tendencies to corrupt children"". Vianne, who is much broader in her mindset mixes freely with Roux and the group causing these folks quite a bit of discomfort.Needless to say, from here the conflict gets heady due to ""sudden turn"" of events.

It was also nominated for eight BAFTAs, and four Golden Globes & 29 nominations. Judi Dench won a Screen Actors Guild Award for her performance in the film. Story- Chocolat is a 2000 American-British romance film based on the novel of the same name by Joanne Harris, and was directed by Lasse Hallström. Adapted by screenwriter Robert Nelson Jacobs, Chocolat tells the story of a young mother, played by Juliette Binoche, who arrives at the fictional, repressed French village of Lansquenet-sous-Tannes with her six-year-old daughter and opens La Chocolaterie Maya, a small chocolaterie. Her chocolate quickly begins to change the lives of the townspeople, and shakes up the rigid morality of the community. It scored more than 6 according to the critics.",Chocolat

213,mosmanic,What women like......,8,27 February 2001,"Chocolat is a well chosen title for this smooth, creamy, bittersweet production, that will surely rank as one of the favourite women's movies of all time, with perhaps a little less enthusiasm from men.Set in provincial France in 1960, it is a fascinating study of the conflict between stuffy small-town conservatism with its deep religious roots of suffering for its own sake, and the new  freedom of spirit that characterises our modern age. Few films have illustrated so well this transitional time. Perhaps it is a little obviously sentimental and overly simplistic in setting up the adversaries to manipulate our sympathies, but I think it is churlish to call it sickly.Rarely does a film evoke such a sense of place, with all of the action taking place in an ancient hilltop town by a lazy river - emphasised beautifully by the opening shot zooming in on it, and the closing shot zooming back out. We are transported sensually and emotionally to this town and its inhabitants, and involved totally in the ensuing events. There are fine performances from a well chosen cast, whose French accents speaking English work well in setting the scene. And Johnny Depp even makes a plausible Irishman rover.Sure, it's a fable, and the mystical aspects of the lead character's motivations and wanderings may leave one feeling that more flashback scenes may have added credibility, but I think it is a shame to nitpick over what is a very pleasing, feelgood flick that will give many hankies a workout.",Chocolat
214,PaulineDorchester,Lighten up.,7,24 February 2001,"This is a really fine small film, and I can recommend it without reservation.  It is extremely well-acted and well-produced.  I wonder if we will see a revival of fitted bodices and wide skirts as a result of its women's costumes (it is set in 1960).Even so, I am only giving ""Chocolat"" a 7 out of 10, because the film -- or maybe Miramax's marketing department -- has delusions of grandeur.  Someone has decided that it's about big issues like inclusivity, acceptance and free love, but it's really just a cute story about a newcomer upsetting the life a highly provincial small town, and nothing more than that.  It can't bear the weight that's being heaped on it.  For the record, it does have a definite anti-Catholic tinge.  I'm not a Catholic, but I did notice this.  Why has the Catholic League for Religious and Civil Rights not had anything to say?",Chocolat

It has everything (prevailing theme, strong plot, fine acting, pretty cinematography, luscious chocolate, etc.) that encompasses a strong film.  The film is a little over 2 hours long and the time just flew by!!I'm also a huge Juliette Binoche fan.  She has filled out from her English Patient days and wow she looks good.  In that scene where her and Johnny Depp are on that little boat and she is laid out on the bench, I was like OH MY GOD!!!! Anyway, I digress.... This is an excellent film.  I recommend it to everyone.  In my opinion, it's the 2nd best film of 2000 (behind Gladiator).",Chocolat
217,donalohanlon,Some do... Some don't,10,18 February 2003,"Chocolat is one of those films that divides people into two distictcamps. Those who are utterly turned off by it's fairytale quality andthose who are caught up in it's fable like sensibilities. That ofcourse is fair enough.However those who claim that Miramax & Harvey Weinstein boughta nomination for Best Picture are being utterly ridiculous. Chocolattook out 108 trade adverts coming up to the awards, while Erinbrokovich took out 110. No one said Erin Brokovich had boughtnominations, and that film was in general release. Maybe theAcademy genuinely liked Chocolat?!There is much to like. Juliette Binoche, although not her finestperformance, is soothing, beautiful and serene. Alfred Molinacreates a brilliant ""baddie"" while supporting turns from Dench, olinand Depp are all good. The film may be 'safe' and pedestrian but itis always highly entertaining and worthwhile.Give the Academy credit for not being bought - what would theygain?

218,azerda,A missed opportunity,7,9 January 2001,"This is a beautiful movie, visually if not in the underlining story. Hallestrom really missed the boat here, for this movie, the first 99% at least, is about tolerance and the evils of extremist religion. Most would agree that Catholicism, and most religions, are not about subjugating the lowly. It is the people in charge who misconstrue the teachings and traditions to those ends. And, I thought, that would be the message here. I was wrong. The people of the 'tiny hamlet' are a happy people for the most part. Of the evils portrayed, only one is even remotely related to religion, and even then it is more the traditions of the town rather than the teachings of Jesus which create the situation. The real villain here is the Count. So why, pray tell, does Hallestrom forsake all that was built to take a cheap jab at the institution rather than the individual who is at fault?For such a beautiful, and dare I say, sweet movie, the end result left a sour taste in my mouth.",Chocolat

We both loved the actors (Johnny Depp is one of my personal favorites... he could do no wrong), we loved the setting, the story, and the ending...  Johnny Depp's character was reminiscent (to me, at least, and my husband agreed) of his Don Juan DeMarco character (without as many laughs). For a while there, I was wondering if Juliette's character was going to be like the shop owner in ""Needful Things""!  (She wasn't!)  We both (1 PhD and a non) highly recommend this film.",Chocolat

221,pierfconsa,a beautiful novel between tradition and esoteric fantasy,10,8 January 2001,"Chocolat is a movie that deserves to be seen. The development of the story is mastered with grace and experience: the elements, the scenario, the characters are the perfect products of the writer's imagination. A lady (a marvellously matured Juliet Binoche)coming from far and foreign lands, carrying with her a luggage of esoteric knowledge earned in exotic lands, blends chocolate for the villagers of a small town in France. The magic power of her particular blends gives the villagers happiness and excitement. But the magic restorative powers of the woman's chocolate are soon antagonized by the bigotry of the village's count.  The count, through his allied the village's chaplain, tries every possible way to hamper the lady's business.  The struggle between the esoteric woman and the bigot count reaches it's acme when a boat of roaming Irishmen comes to the village. As the woman befriends the boat's captain (a wonderful Johnny Depp confirming his classy quality acting), the battle ignites.  When the ardor of the battle smothers away, the lady feels the strong Northern wind, signifying that she needs to move on to the next place, but the love for her beautiful daughter makes her stop the tradition that her grandmother started: of traveling from place to place to propagate the healing qualities of her chocolate.The story is beautiful and captivating.  Also, the author manages to convey the well-known theme of the struggle between tradition and innovation quite handsomely, without ever polluting the smooth development of the story.  It will make your heart warm and tender, it will wet your eyes, and make you laugh.",Chocolat
222,cmzapffe,Sweet Trifle But Not Filling Enough for a Cinematic,7,4 March 2001,"Rather simplistic morality fable of an unearthly woman, Vianne Rocher(Juliette Binoche), and child literally ""blowing"" into a small, provincial French village during the Fifties on the wings of the cold winds from the North. She rents a patisserie shop from an aged owner, Armande Voizin(Judi Dench), and quickly rehabilitates it into the chocolate shop of the title.  Her magical gifts at creating these sweet wonders and also anticipating the exact delight of each of her prospective clients comes from her own mother, a Mayan priestess with whom her father had had a doomed relationship.  Unfortunately, all of this activity takes place right at the start of Lent in this heavily Catholic town under both the political and the moral guidance of the Mayor Comte de Reynaud(Alfred Molina). The mayor is also currently occupied in the training of the newly-arrived priest so as to elevate him to his own exacting moralistic standards.The Mayor takes it as a personal affront that this young woman has opened this shop of gustatory pleasures during the Lenten period when fasting and denying yourself of all earthly pleasures is supposed to be the rule. He threatens to close her down before the end of Lent.  The few allies Vianne finds in the town include her landlady and also a battered wife, Josephine Muscat(Lena Olin).  This situation quickly develops into a crisis setting when a boatload of musical drifters headed by Roux(Johnny Depp) drop achor in the river that flows through the town.  The two non-comformists quickly link up as allies while the Mayor and his allies try to figure out how to get this new threat of the floating riff-raff back on their boat and off to the next town as soon as possible.While I am a sucker for ancient European villages and all period romances, this story didn't develop either the romance or the story to levels raised by all the Oscar hoopla.  Neither the movie nor Juliette Binoche nor Judi Dench deserved their Oscar nominations.  Binoche's's character was not fleshed out enough to allow us to get to know what really motivated her.  Furthermore, while the shop is proclaimed to be a success the exchange of money for sweets is not once shown during the movie.  My vote for an Oscar nomination would only have gone to Lena Olin for her rich portrayal of a battered wife picking herself up and starting over as Binoche's assistant chocolatier.  Rating: ***(Three Stars, out of four) for a trifle that is sweet but not filling enough to serve as a full cinematic meal.",Chocolat
223,Sir Ulrich Von Lichtenstein,The Worst Best picture Nominee Ever,3,6 June 2001,"Judi Dench was good enough to make me give this a 3. The rest of the film is a 1. ""Chocolat"" features mediocre direction, acting ranging from good (Judi Dench) to gut-wrenchingly awful (Alfred Molina and Peter Stormare), and a script that is nothing more than a long string of lame and shallow cliches. This film is more predictable than a ""Mighty Ducks"" movie, and has all the subtlety of a nuclear blast. Nice message, but it's hammered in so hard that's impossible to mist. Not only doesn't require you to think, strictly forbids you from doing so. It's best picture slot should have gone to a more deserving film, which could have been anything from ""Cast Away"" or ""Billy Elliott"" to even ""Charlie's Angels"" (hardly that good a film, but still better than ""Chocolat"".",Chocolat
224,Yuri-8,Too many sweets lead to diabetes,5,1 March 2001,"OK I admit it. I like European movies. Mostly because compared to the usual US productions they are untrivial in subject matter, and have original cinematography and acting. Sadly, 'Chocolat' is not one of those. The movie is bound to have you feel good when you leave the theatre. However, I have seen enough of 'feel-good' movies to require something else to enjoy one--some originality perhaps? The good parts of the movie are the setting and the cast, but the cinematographer does not manage to do anything special with eihter. Indeed, it seems that the primary technique to amuse the viewer is to do a close-up on Juliette Binoche (always wearing red, with bright red lipstick) and hold it there: look, isn't she beautiful. As to the plot... cheesy and predictable. I am not religious, but as many others. I also find that attacks on Christian values are a little bit out of place. If you want to make a movie about hypocrisies of religion, you can deal with the topic thoroughly--otherwise the cartoonish portrayal of Christian life is enough to offend the believer but not enough to make it believable.And lastly--what was Johnny Depp doing in the film???",Chocolat
225,MrEguy,To say that Lasse Hallstrom is a genius,10,19 December 2000,"To say that Lasse Hallstrom is a genius would be close to the truth. This film is brilliantly done!

226,TwzzlrFrk,I'm hungry.,8,16 February 2001,"Mmm . . . all those delicious chocolate scenes. All movie theatre concession stands would love to show this movie! I'm sure that if it wasn't for the fact that the movie was so darn good, half the theatre would've left their seats to go and sample some of the less exotic munchies.Chocolat is a story of a young woman, Vianne (Binoche), and her child, Anouk coming to settle in a small French town in the 1960s. ""Tranquilité"". The best possible description of life in this quiet village. But soon Vianne opens a chocolaterie which threatens to ruin the serene existence of the town. Most perturbed is the straight-edge, Catholic fundamentalist mayor, Comte de Reynaud (Molina), for what represents temptation more than luscious chocolate? And to open a chocolate shop in the middle of Lent?! The nerve! Reynaud tries persistently to ruin Vianne's business and to run her and the immorality she represents out of town.This movie is deceptively simple. The story itself is enticing; a treat to watch; full of emotion and hilarity. But behind the beautiful cinematography lies symbolism. The urn, the Northwesterly winds - there is meaning in everything. This aspect is neither overdone, nor ignored. In the end, ""Chocolat"" is a film about the continuing battle between tradition and modernization. It's a story about the revealing the undying yearning within ourselves - the yearning for something new and exhilarating. Something indulging.The performances are fantastic. Binoche is at her finest. Judi Dench is remarkable as always. Molina is phenomenal, and everyone else just seems perfectly casts. There isn't a single character that you don't want to empathize with at some point or another. The scenery is beautiful and Lasse Hallström's directing is superb.This is one movie that you should come out of, not feeling gypped of $8. I actually spend $5.75 on popcorn and didn't mind. This is a truly one of those once-in-a-while films that touches audiences while it around. In a couple years it may be long forgotten, for audience have instead decided to remember unintelligent, gory films with little substance (ahem . . . Gladiator), so let's enjoy it while it around.I give it 8/10 (and I'm a hard marker!). So I beg you, please go to see ""Chocolat"", one of the few charming, heartwarming and delightful films you will see for a long time to come. As for me, I'm going to find some chocolate!",Chocolat

229,Mik_Cal,Hackneyed script/France as caricature,5,2 December 2007,"Some great and attractive actors and actresses put together in a, sorry for the pun, too saccharine and hackneyed tale. Traditional religion is made to seem in a caricatured way intolerant and anti-sensual while Binoche's character's unnecessary provocativeness is meant to seem like the embodiment of sensuality. It would be one thing if this movie were made in the 1950's or earlier but made in the year 2000, this type of rebellion does not seem as heroic as Hallstrom would have us believe. If anything we in late 20th and early 21st century are struggling with an overabundance of sensual delights not with repressive intolerance of them. I am all for sensuality and smart sensuality still needs its advocates but Hallstrom has washed out the vital distinctions in backdating the tale.There are belated attempts in the movie to add depth to the characters and to re-arrange the cartoonishness of the initial clash between repression and sensuality.",Chocolat

231,chateau_dwars,"A warm, sensual and exciting movie about l'amour",7,2 August 2007,"Being as it is that Julliette and Johnny are both two of my favorite actors, I had to see this movie. Comments weren't as positive as I'd hoped, but as everyone has a taste of their own, I decided to take my sister to the DVD rental shop and we got Chocolat. Having lived in France and fully understanding the language, my sister loved the French taste this movie provides. Julliette is a very beautiful actress who has a sense of calm and tranquility about her. This makes watching her even more so enjoyable.Being the Johnny Depp fan that I am, of course I was anxious to see him. His role is also a very subtle one, not pushing his character nor trying to be the pretty boy people want him to be. To me, he's like Kate Winslet; always looking for films that suit him, not his wallet. Obviously Pirates let aside, but still that was an alternative role as well.With everything that goes on in the village, and with knowledge that most women on this planet like chocolate, I really suggest you watch this movie. It's not flawless but it brings that French atmosphere right into your living room and gets you to wanting to learn the language, or go there. Maybe even start your own 'chocolaterie'. A beautiful performance by Julliette who deserves to be called the best French actress of the moment alongside with Audrey Tatou!",Chocolat

I was right on both accounts, it was not standard Hollywood and it was different. But it was also great. How refreshing to watch a movie that didn't depend on sex scenes, special effects, or ""over the top"" violence to entertain. The acting was superb, the script was well crafted and the direction offered a lot of ""eye candy"" so you didn't want to look away. I especially like the dialogue.

233,rich56,A nice light confection,8,27 February 2001,"I enjoyed Chocolat for what it was. A nice light confection of a movie. Juliette Binoche is simply luminous as a young woman who arrives in a small French town(circa 1959) and proceeds to turn it upside down after setting up a chocolate shop,selling her wares with it's 'special ingredient' apparentley designed to loosen inhibitions. Almost immediately she attracts the attention of the mayor(wonderfully played by Alfred Molina), a man who takes his Christian vows very seriously and feels everyone else should too. What follows is a battle of wills between the two,with each side finding their allies. Judi Dench is brilliant,as usual, as an elderly woman estranged from her daughter and grandson, who befriends Binoche. Other townspeople,including an abused wife who takes up with her, also add great color to the film. Johnny Depp arrives halfway through the movie as a 'river rat' to also add to the mayor's consternation. Much of this,of course, is a little predictable and the ending comes as no great surprise. Still I enjoyed it quite a lot while it was unfolding. Yes,perhaps it doesn't quite deserve all its Oscar nominations(you can blame or credit Miramax's marketing for that) but I'd still say if you love movies you'll like Chocolat. Like our heroine's delicious looking hot chocolate, it goes down easily.",Chocolat

Seeing all of those truffles, creams, and exotic blends of all sorts made my current diet all the more tortuous.  It seriously put me in the mood for a sinful truffle or two, right when I needed them the least.As for the film itself, it works a special charm usually reserved for the most cherished of fairy tales.  The underlying magic, the strong but all-too-human heroine, and the beautiful ensemble of characters all come together to make one of the finest movies of 2000.  The ending works against that magical feel, in ways that I can not explain without making a spoiler, however that is a minor complaint.It even was enough to make me shed a tear (or a few) at parts.  Yes, it really IS that great of a movie.This movie is truly as delicate, as beautiful, and as sweet as all of the chocolates that it displays.  Highly recommended.9 out of 10.",Chocolat

He knows and loves his industry, and he collaborates with others, with so much respect. He's like the late, great Mac Miller in that way: he's so sweet and talented, humble and powerful. I thought his dancing scene with Juliette showcased this especially. He said this about her: ""if art is possible in cinema, I think she comes as close as anyone can.""Pair all of that with what looks like expert chocolatiering, a fabulous supporting cast, river-gypsies, and the family lore of grandmere et grandpere, and you have a rich, delicious story.",Chocolat

I want to kick myself now for waiting this long to see it!  Yes, I forsook the big screen for the video but I wasn't disappointed a bit.Chocolat is a wonderful movie.  It deals with real issues that people face. The characters are believable because they have flaws.  They've got inward struggles which makes this film even better.  It's a story of the human condition and how even deep prejudices can be overcome by the simple act of kindness and the willingness to strive for individuality.I have to admit the only reason I wanted to watch this movie at first was because of Johnny Depp.  I have to say I loved his performance as Roux.  I wished the writers would've done more with his character but what we did get to feast on was incredible.  Juliette Binoche was also incredible as Vianne and the chemistry between all the actors was great.I would recommend Chocolat.  If you haven't seen it, what are you waiting for?  It's great to see there are still film makers out there that have a sense of humanity.  Chocolat is all of that and more.

I am French and I come from Montpellier and I know the department of the ""Tarn"" and this sure doesn't look like it. It looks like northern France or even England but not like the south west. And why is it that we French people speak with an accent in american movie, is the american viewer too stupid to understand that they are in fact speaking in french? (en francais dans le texte) so why not let everybody speak english normally please... Furthermore, in 1959, almost half of the french population was communist. Where did they find a village in Tarn without a communist mayor in 1959? Have they heard of the french revolution? You know when we cut the heads off nobles like the Conte, and killed all our priests. This is the way Americans WANT to see France, not the way it was or is. The plot is so childish and predictable it's depressing. They even get the ""Gitans"" showing the stupid villagers how to enjoy life. Actually they weren't Gypsies but ""River people"". I have never heard of them before. It must have been an invention of the director, or they got confused with Ireland ?

247,overdog_001,A combination of good plots,7,26 February 2012,"There are several little stories told in this little gem, but the two that stand out for me are the sort of Mary Poppins quality of a strange, mysterious woman (Binoche) who brings joy (and a little upset) to a staid community, and the dignity of the older woman (Dench) who refuses to allow a malady to define who she is, and who she chooses to be remembered as.Some grand life lessons lie herein, as does a rather good effort by Depp as well. It is interesting to see Leslie Caron's contribution, even though I'm not much of a Caron (Lili) fan. Lena Olin is enchanting and dependable, as usual.",Chocolat
248,jettbrowne924,Near Perfect,9,6 February 2005,"Juliette Binoche is absolutely sublime as is everyone else in this finely casted film. It has been stated that Miramax shoved this movie down everyone's throats to garner some Academy Noms. Complete hubris. Binoche's expressions and reactions are so touching and so real, that you forget you are witnessing fiction. Lena Olin is also outstanding in her role of Josephine; a villager who is ostracized from the rest of the town for leaving her husband who is abusing her. There are so many plots woven in this tale that it would not be fair for me to try and summarize this. All I can say is, see this movie. It moves so fast and every scene is a delight.

I don't understand why this timeless tale of enjoying the sweetness of life is so badly screenwritten and so repetitive in all of its scenes. We never get to understand what this movie is all about and what moves the characters. Did Lasse only copied ""Babette's Feast"" or he didn't know that chocolate is only good in pieces? Still, Juliette Binoche is wonderful as always.",Chocolat
250,jvddoes,Chocolat is Babette's Feast done worse...,5,20 April 2002,"Chocolat is about freeing narrow-minded religious people living in a closed society by means of exquisite taste. This theme is taken directly from Gabriel Axels's Babette's Feast. But compared to Babette's Feast, Chocolat is not a good movie. The storyline is shouted into your face, no events are left to surprise you, and the emotions are as if looking at the gypsy boy with a tear in his eye. I only enjoyed the environ, the clothing, the colours, and that's just not enough to make a film worthwhile.",Chocolat
251,hotdotheden,Same Old Story,5,22 December 2020,"This movie really contains all the top actors of Sweden as well as Brad Pitt that I love and overall the cast is superb. But Lasse Hallstrom as a director hasn't evolved at all even today and it's like he's shooting ""My Life as a Dog"" over and over again.This is beautifully filmed and directed but I couldn't keep focus anyway. It's sad as Hallstrom could do so much with this cast but it just becomes a sequal of nothingness all through this film.For me personally this is a 1 star movie and the 5 is just for the wonderful scenary filmed with perfection and really good performances from Lena Olin, Peter Stormare, Brad Pitt and others but I have the same problem with this as I got with Ingmar Bergman movies but in a different way. Lasse made his name and just continued from there with nothing new to surprise me just as Ingmar did in my mind.If you got no problem with tiresome repetions or haven't seen any movies from Hallstrom earlier so watch it. Just don't think you can watch another of his movies and feel even slightly surprised.Otherwise watch Pitt in 12 monkeys, Olin in The Unbearable Lightness of Being or why not Stormare in Fargo or The Big Lebowski. I guess Bergman did his share in educating Olin and Stormare but Hallstrom just makes them almost into ghosts of the silver screen and I just checked the time-line for Pitt on wiki to get things right in this review and amongst all movies he acted in over the years this one is not even listed so I rest my case...Watch and enjoy if you can live with not remembering anything of it in 5 sec or skip if you have better things to do with your life!",Chocolat
252,Steve C,"acting mostly good in spite of dialogue, plot, and esp DIRECTING",4,7 January 2001,"Judi Dench & Juliette Binoche were great, Lena Olin and most of the rest of the supporting cast were reasonably good.  It's really amazing in the face of all the obstacles.I tried to have an open mind walking into this movie.  I saw the Cider House Rules and thought it was one of the worst movies I've seen in several years, but I thought I'd give Hallestrom another chance.  Within a half hour it was clear that this film was the same random mix of plot devices without any consistency from scene to scene, sacrificing a consistent lighthearted tone in order to sprinkle in a few ""serious"" situations (domestic violence, etc) - I suppose because the director wants the film to seem ""important"".  Yet even within the same scene, or a scene later the difficulties have been resolved.(warning, spoilers follow) The film is filled with silly plot inconsistencies, I suspect because the director is more concerned with plot devices and cheap audience emotional manipulation (certainly the case in cider house rules) than any kind of story with ""flow"" or ""unity"".  One sees this in almost every scene - but a few examples: 1) After the Lena Olin character is abused, the JB character starts philosophizing about her husband even though she's apparently spoken about 2 sentences to the guy.  2) questionable motivations are everywhere: for instance, JB wants to leave her entire investment in chocolate tools and goods because of this ""north wind"".  That would be acceptable if we knew more about this ""north wind"", or the director had developed the story about her emotional attachment to it (but what can you do when you have 50 other stories to tell), but it seemed completely arbitrary and silly.At the very least, go to the matinee, don't pay full price for this movie.",Chocolat

All the high-school teachers will try to convince you that there is a literary point to each novel.  The only literal point I can see is to bring food on those poor novelists' tables.Here is how things go:  Some bugger comes to town and manages to turn it up-side-down despite ample resistance.  Yet everyone still thank him for screwing everything up and, guess what, the novel ends here so we won't see the poor folks cleaning up after him!Joanne Harris is no 19th century English novelist; she's from 20th century England.  Neither is her work a stereotypical English novel; it's actually two English novels in one.  Speaking of bargains!Meanwhile, you have the directors like Hallström, who think that you haven't been listening to your high-school teacher.  Hey, this work is absolutely pointless, but I will make it looks like a social commentary.  So here it is, a two-hour epic.  Now swallow whatever it has to offer or be labelled ""insensitive"" and ""old-school"" for the rest of the night.Why this work is Oscar-worthy?

And the movie about the relationship between food and life has been done much better, especially in ""Tampopo,"" but even in ""Like Water for Chocolate"" if you're looking for a better chocolate movie.At least it was good to see Juliette Binoche and Lena Olin working together again, especially in very much reverse-different roles than they played in ""Unbearable Lightness of Being."" And hey, a surprisingly good performance from Carrie-Ann Moss. We expect, and of course get here, fine performances from Alfred Molina and Dame Judi Dench.

The film is narrated like a fair tale and is more a comedy than a drama, therefore I do not understand some comments regarding the catholic conceptions being not respected. Hey guys, let's take this kind of discussion to more serious movies. My friend Jessica-Koll indicated me this one and I am not disappointed it is light and tastes (literally) good. Carrie Anne and Juliette are still very beautiful women and Johnny Depp is OK as a river ""pirate"" showing that he would have a great future as being a certain crazy and ambitious sea pirate that everybody here knows very well.

The fact that the mother and the daughter always change their place due to a some kind of tradition, and also the red cloaks, they wear during traveling, make the movie a little fantastical. I think this movie would be a good story to tell kids before they sleep:)I will tell mine if I have one:) Juliette Binoche had really a great performance. She lets the audience easily believe that she is such a warm and sweet person. It was touching that The grandmother and the grandson see each other secretly and love each other very much. When you see how happy they are together you just hate the mother, who separates them ruthlessly. Watch this movie and you will enjoy magical rural France without going there! You will find yourselves in a fairytale place.",Chocolat

The film contains some wonderful actors and interesting visuals, but the screenplay contains capricious changes to the storyline and characters; in many cases characters' attitudes and actions are so altered as to be nearly unrecognizable.I don't expect the film to slavishly follow the book, but I expect any changes to either improve upon the story, better enable the story to be told via film, or at worst do no harm.  Few of the alterations made to Chocolat meet these criteria.",Chocolat

The combination of story, scenery, music and cast makes this one fine movie to view. Juliette Binoche is beautiful and graceful and though Not my favorite Johnny Depp film, he fills the required romance needed in this movie. Who could not watch a movie with so much Chocolate involved!! Just about everybody loves Chocolate and so this ingredient brings together old lovers to new lovers and old friends to new friends.

I am looking for some originally like the Wonder Boys, Unbreakable or even Return to Me.  The latter was predicatable but way better than this one.My wife loved it and I guess as a fairytale it was okay.  However, I felt ripped off by this film - so formulaic.  It appeared the characters were having a much better time than I was eating all that chocolat. 
Perhaps if Miramax distributed a free box of Chocolates at the door it would have been much more satisifying.This is a date rental movie at the most.  Oscars should not even be mentioned.",Chocolat

The cast is impressive both in names and performances. Juliette Binoche, of course, too rare on screen delivers her best,the utmost being this short sequence on boat with J. Depp. This last is equals to himself : cool and deep together. But definitely, the most pleasant surprises come from Judi Denchand Carrie-Anne Moss.  Both act beautifully with a perfect sens oftiming and gradual feeling. Awkwardly this movie was better praised in USA than in Europe. In Belgium and France, ""official"" critics were rather severe inassessing the movie.  Probably the cause for this was the englishlanguage chosen for a script happening in a french small town.

Ever reach for what you think is a raspberry cream, bite into it, and discover with horror that it's coconut? Such, I'm afraid, is Chocolat.Visually pleasing, set in a quaint European town, and often showing us luscious takes of velvety chocolate being stirred, poured, or brewed into hot cocoa, Chocolat, unfortunately, never gets any more profound than a box of chocolates either. The movie would somehow have us accept the premise that chocolate, mysterious substance of the ancient Mayans, can solve most of our problems if we let it. The movie casts some talented actors, among them Juliette Binoche, Alfred Molina, and the enigmatic Johnny Depp in an unsatisfying supporting role. But the script they are given to work with is so shallow and unclever as to make the actors' efforts to lend meaning to the words almost embarrassing. We finally learn, at the climax of the story, that Depp's character (whom we have been looking to desperately to provide some meaningful entertainment) likes hot chocolate. Did I miss something?How this movie received such gushing praise, as well as numerous nominations for excellence, confirms my suspicion that the entertainment industry is largely candy-coated image, without much substance.So you can bite down into this one, but don't expect to get a raspberry cream.",Chocolat

268,tomlevi,A tale to tell,9,15 August 2003,"Many quibble when discussing Hallstrom's artistic work, but 'Chocolat' has a tale to tell. The film explores the compassion of man with dynamic tone. Indeed the moral of this fairy tale is tolerance, acceptance, of both individuals and their communities. The bright tone of the film is owed largely to the impressionable performance by Juliette Binoche (as Vianne). With a distinctly French setting, Hallstrom offers stimulating photography, an emotive soundtrack, and powerful motif, in his efforts to promote a community spirit, most effectively captivated in the final sequence. Unfortunately I was disappointed with the final scene, although nevertheless, the film suggests a renewed moral depth and a spiritual dimension, a common theme of the literary world in our increasingly secular and perhaps emotionally shallow society.Quite a didactic film, and with an open mind, quite a satisfying film.",Chocolat

I thought it would be good but it wasn't.A single mum who doesn't go to church arrives in a small town to open a chocolate shop on lent. Everyone thinks she's a no good atheist whore. As the film goes on, the same scene happens over and over. ""Oh you have problems? Well come on in, eat some of my cruddy chocolate."" ""No really I couldn't, God would disapprove!"" ""Go ahead!"" ""OK then... mmmmmmmm... this is some good chocolate, liberalism is great isn't it?"" All the while the mayor still hates her guts and tries to drive her out of town.Juliette Binoche is sickeningly smug. Dame bloody Judi Dench delivers a typically ""oh everyone in Hollywood loves me, look at me lending my genius in another small role to another lame film"" performance with her accent wittering all over the place. Dirty gypo, Johnny Depp turns up to see what he can do for the film but is too busy playing guitar and trying to shag the aforementioned atheist whore to manage anything. You can tell they thought they were being bloody clever when they made it. I loathed every single one of the characters and by the end was hoping they'd all get aids and die.It is a stupid film in the guise of smart film for stupid people to put on their favourite film list next to Sleepers and Shawshank Redemption as though they're some sort of arty film critic.

I saw it because I really, really like Johnny Depp (as my screen-name implies) but it turned out to be an excellent movie. I thought that it started a little slow, but that could very possibly just be that I was waiting to see Johnny Depp. The basic story line is that a woman and her daughter come to a town full of conformists and open a chocolaterie. The problem arises when the mayor comes and invites her to church and she refuses. Things continue in this manor until Johnny Depp's character, Roux, shows up. I think that my heart skipped a beat when I saw him. He simply looked gorgeous. He was probably my favorite part of the movie. It is impossible to look away from him.

I thought he was okay in Spiderman 2, but not in this one. It could be just the way he is portrayed in Chocolat, though. I thought Judi Dench was brilliant in this movie - very very funny! I also thought Lena Olin was all right. So I guess the only actors/actresses I didn't like were Alfred Molina and Juliette Binoche. Juliette Binoche was okay, but I didn't love her.

This is not a French film, it's nothing like one.  Not that I love French films - most of them are morbidly depressing.  OK, beside the fact that it was inauthentic, the whole thing felt like the product of a focus-group.  I didn't find a single thing in that film that surprised me that left me with a sense of something I hadn't seen before.  It was all predictably played out (and nicely), to elicit our common emotions.Possible Spoiler follows =======================>The fact of the all-too-happy ending.  The town converts to chocolate lovers, the river-boy comes back, the Priest tells people to enjoy life, Mr. Mayor eventually will ask what's-her-face out for dinner, Pontouf goes away and the Anouk doesn't miss him.I didn't hate this flick - it was pleasant enough - but I would have rather not bothered to see it.",Chocolat

He WAS planned to play a different character, but he asked the director for this role. Juliette Binoche, Lena Olin and Victoire Thivisol plays fantastically. Juliette and Lena have played against each other earlier, but I hadn't heard about Thivisol before. She's great in her role as daughter of Vianne Rocher. Lasse Hallström is also a great director.

Vianne (Juliette Binoche) is the only one without desire (or is she?) in this movie as she plays the love goddess/witch/wise women who blows into town with the north wind, allowing the inhabitants of the quaint village to live out their long held desires. Nothing will be the same again.By intuitively choosing each character's favourite chocolate, she allows them to break free from the oppressive restraints of life in this church dominated, claustrophobic country town.  Oddly, the repression is overtly represented by the Mayor, played by Alfred Molina, rather than the village priest, as one might expect.The unfolding of this classic three part drama is supported by superb casting, with Binoche beatific, Judi Dench brilliant and Molina taking the prize with his (mostly) understated performance as the villain with the soft centre (another chocolate metaphor?).  Johnny Depp, as the otherwise plot-pointless Irish gypsy, looks suitably decorative and does well as the love interest for the love goddess.  After all, she had to get some reward for all the love she brings to people's lives!The warmth and wit of the script and the engaging characters are complemented by the great sets and gorgeous photography to make an overall wonderful film that had the audience in my cinema spontaneously applauding as the credits rolled!",Chocolat

The movie will also find its adherents among those who might have enjoyed Terms of Endearment, The Color Purple, Bridges of Madison County, The Piano, or other movies such in which it's open season on husbands and fathers. The main difference with Chocolat is that it is set in a quaint old French town (the rustic beauty of which is the movie's only redeeming feature from this reviewer's perspective), and it throws in a buckshot load of popular Catholic bashing as something of a bonus.Bringing our comparisons up to date, this slightly surreal film is American Beauty with the town's patriarch and mayor playing the role of the ex-marine across the street.  Traditional French small-town society, we are shown, can be as disfunctional as modern, suburban America, while the only solid, well-adjusted people are those whom society usually scorns for no good reason.If you want to see a realistic portrayal of rural France with real people behaving less than virtuously, go see a real French movie like Manon of the Spring/Jean de Florette.

In fact, it is used in a way to emphasize and think about humanity. It portrays the precious things in life that make us human, like kindness, tolerance, friendship, and of course, the inner struggles and tensions that we all face.

283,pianistcomposer,"Wonderful film, even if the plot is a bit contrived.",7,23 March 2005,"This movie was made by secular humanists for secular humanists. The central conflict: Chocolate or God? The heathen drifter who opens up a Chocolaterie in a trussed-up town or the town's control-freak mayor/count? You decide. It's obvious where the movie-makers' sympathies lie: chocolate, for sure. Of course, in real life, the matter is much more complicated than ""Lent"" or ""eat"", but until Hollywood begins exploring actual esoteric spiritual practices (and the individuals who commit to them) rather than continuously trotting out the convenient exoteric ""straw man"" of mere believers' religiosity (which tends to either severely control and limit or entirely forbid ""pleasures of the flesh"" because all that's truly looked forward to is the world thereafter), there won't be a really interesting film made about the apparent dichotomy between bodily life and religion. That said, the film itself was well-done; acting superb, music beautiful and just right for the style, locations perfect. Judi Dench is a goddess. I was actually hoping the little girl would turn out to have a kangaroo, unexplained, but alas, that would have been too interesting. So the figurative kangaroo hops away at the end, leaving the girl free to grow roots into the town which has come to accept and enjoy the novelty proffered by her mother and her mother's new helpers. All in all, I enjoyed it, got the occasional warm fuzzy, and just felt generally good all over like I do whenever I see anyone (in life or on film) push (or get shown) beyond whatever current limitations bind them. These townspeople were brought from strictness, pseudo-""tranquilite"", reluctance to embrace anything beyond what they'd been brought up to embrace, and fear of the consequences of that, and into acceptance and embrace of new and unknown things. But who (and how?) will push them beyond chocolate? Probably not Hollywood; not anytime soon, anyway, judging by this.",Chocolat

The characters are very well developed, and the story unfolds such that I truly felt a part of that small town for a brief while. When Vianne and her daughter Anouk come to the small, uptight French village, they shake things up slowly (and sometimes painfully) despite the best efforts of the Mayor, Comte de Reynaud. The Comte, who makes life hell for Vianne and her daughter, initially seems to be a bully and villain. However, he is slowly revealed to be an unhappy man who is battling his own inner demons.Vianne, through her generous spirit, helps liberate many villagers (including the Comte) who are trapped in one way or another by their circumstance. However, the villagers also liberate Vianne of her conviction that she is destined to wander always with no permanent home.The way that all of the characters interact eventually creates an environment of tolerance and a realization that there is joy in experiencing the variety that is life.This is a film that I can definitely watch again and again.",Chocolat

The village location is perfect for a old world slow lifestyle charm. Messaging is subtle and strong. Judi Dench's presence as always is royal and majestic. Juliette Binoche fits in perfectly in the lead role and has charming personality.Not very pleased with Alfred Molina's representation of the character Helene provides strong supporting presence.

You don't know if this is going to be comical, which you would expect when you see all the devoted silly faces in Sunday church, or if it is a documentary about cocoa since the narrator takes you to South America where Vianne's father apparently got sexually stimulated after drinking hot chocolate. Or did he just got excited by the hot Amazonian girls by the campfire? Anyway, in the end it is just going to be a fairytale with a grouchy grandmother played by Judi Dench, that despite her grade one diabetes indulges herself in chocolate. A village Mayor (Alferd Molina) who is estranged from his wife for over six months and thinks that chocolate is going to give him the desired satisfaction he lacks since. He looks more like a Mr. Cluso when he rolls in to the Chocolatery and gives a boring performance of how not to eat truffles. What is the conspiracy behind here? Tobacco companies cannot buy into the movie scene anymore and now we are looking at Cadbury's or Droste to sell us more than chocolate actually can deliver? In the old days, mankind might have given chocolate some hallucinogenic powers and it does enhances mood in some people and for that matter it took time to get accepted. Similarly today with hemp, all sort of powers and qualities are given to the weed and in 5 or 10 years people will laugh as to how innocent hemp really is and accepted like Chocolat.",Chocolat

294,davidl-7,Pure movie magic,10,26 December 2000,"The year is 1959, but it might just as well be a century or more before, for all the intrusion of modern times and technology in this story of a mysterious woman (Binoche) and her daughter who arrive in a small French town and open a chocolate shop during Lent, which angers the mayor, a devout and intolerant count (Molina) who vows to put her out of business. In a sense, the story is a fairy tale about a good witch who turns a town upside down mainly due to the villagers' fear and ignorance, and does good for them despite themselves. Beautifully shot, wonderfully written, and delightfully acted, the film is as near perfection among romantic comedy-dramas as I have seen in a long time. Binoche is most fetching, Olin fine as a battered wife who blooms (it is magical just for a film buff to contemplate how the actresses and their roles have changed since they were together in ""The Unbearable Lightness of Being""), Molina a wonderful ""villain,"" and Judi Dench as a crusty diabetic landlady somehow made me cry nearly every time she came on screen.

It's almost an Indian fairy tale in which the special chocolate formula that grandpa drinks as a treat makes him fall for the beautiful Maya, Chitza, the grandma. They happily marry, have a daughter, and then the North Wind takes her away. She's out traveling the world, bringing people happiness together with the special Maya chocolate formula. And so the tradition goes on...Now, Vianne has hit the roads with her own daughter, and with Pantoufle of course. And she tells the story about grandma and grandpa almost every night before Anouk falls asleep, peacefully in her bed.And then comes the story we as audiences are being told by Anouk, the daughter in the story itself. That is the story of a woman settling in a small ''tranquille'' French village with her daughter, struggling to achieve her traditional mission as to blow life into those people who are too narrow minded to see, and to live. And that will all be achieved through that superbly delicious treat: Chocolate. All forms, all kinds of chocolate. Chocolate with pepper, with orange, chocolate sauce on turkey...[Attention before you go further: Possible spoiler!] The end: Mission accomplished. Everyone dancing happily, everyone is free, emotions are free, and it is settling time...And so happy is our friend Pantoufle, hopping happily along the streets. Grandma Chitza is contented with her daughter's decision to stay, and Roux returns... No one could ever come up with a happier ending.You realize, this film itself, I mean the story as told by Anouk, was also like a fairy tale. Probably Anouk was telling the story to her own sons/daughters before bed, as the story of their grannies. In fairy tales there is always the happy ending, and so does this story end.With beautiful scenery, almost like out of an illustrated fairy tale book, dreamy-like atmosphere, and colorful characters, this film was a great pleasure to watch, from start to finish. I bursted out laughing in most scenes, the humor was used so cleverly too. Acting was great, cast was full of experienced actors and actresses. And of course, direction is immensely successful. Music is used very effectively, also.Looking at the film poster, I thought this movie was more a romantic one, but after having watched it, I now see that it is everything.

And like your parents tells you when youre a little kid watching a scary movie, ""It's just a movie"". Anyone with a sense of imagination wouldnt let a little thing like that ruin a movie for them.I never felt that this movie bashed religion. Catholics are notoriously strict and this was afterall in the 1950-1960's. You cannot expect a small, catholic town during those days to NOT be strict.I would think most people would enjoy this movie.

301,amberacqua,Chocolat,9,18 December 2008,"I enjoyed very much the book and the film enhanced the magic of the story. I liked the idea that chocolate can change people even the most sour ones. The message of the film is that there is always a solution for every difficult circumstance in our life's- in a shape and taste of a piece of chocolate in this case. This romantic comedy gives a sense of 1959 town in Europe where religion has a great importance. In my opinion, Julliette Binoche plays a sweet and caring role-a personification of her own personal attributes. Whether Jonny Deep gives life to Roux a traveler who music brings joy to the town.The film is best see in French and then subtitled in your mother tongue so the romanticism does not get lost in translation, also because the film is set in Lansquenet, France.",Chocolat

And it seemed that each character was more of a caricature than a true character. The extremely moral mayor, the terrible wife-beater/evil person, the mindless sheep of the parish, the seductive temptress who is misunderstood, etc. I've never been to a small French Catholic village, but I was raised catholic. Most of the people from my church were not so easily guided by the clergy; most of the priests were normal, sinning human beings (some of them even smoked AND drank on occasion!) I thought this was a good story, like fairy tales are good stories. Not necessarily realistic, but entertaining, and with a bit of a moral. Everyone learned a lesson at the end. Well, not the wife-beater so much.I'm also a Johnny Depp fan, and as an aside, when someone is featured on the cover of a movie box, he should appear a tad earlier in the movie, and stay longer!

305,chloemcca,A Truly Delectable Film,10,26 September 2016,"This will forever be one my favorite films. While the plot is a relatively straightforward story about a small town, the film is packed with powerful messages that can benefit everyone, regardless of their background. Each character is well-developed, interesting, and unique, with stellar performances given by all, most notably Juliette Binoche and Judi Dench. The set and location of the film are simple, yet pleasant. Perhaps the only scenes where the characters aren't the center of attention are those where Vianne is making delectable chocolate creations. It just goes to show that telling a good story doesn't require fancy effects or breath-taking scenery. Throughout the film, the overarching themes seem to be the influence of tradition, while the main message is one of tolerance and acceptance. Both Vianne and the conservative villagers struggle with the prospect of giving up certain traditions. Vianne embodies what a main character should be: bold and courageous, but not infallible. She struggles to let go of her timeless family tradition that involves moving from place to place. Meanwhile, the villagers struggle to challenge their own religious traditions and accept ideologies separate from their own. They initially refuse to enter her shop, even though by doing so they would be rewarded with delicious chocolate. This shows just how much influence tradition can have over people. When Roux enters the village, he is treated as an outcast by everyone except Vianne. The romantic relationship that blossoms from their encounter further serves to show viewers that acceptance brings mutual rewards. Overall, as the movie progresses, both Vianne and the villagers go through a slow, believable transitional period with several setbacks along the way. The film furthers this message of acceptance by extending it to single mothers and independent women, both frowned upon especially during that time. The villagers at first are shocked that Anouk is Vianne's illegitimate child, but soon overcome their judgments and realize that this does not define her. Another woman, Josephine, leaves her husband after suffering domestic abuse, eventually gaining control over the café he used to own and starting to live life by her own terms. Another intriguing aspect of the film is that the focus remains on the transitional period of the characters. While you may be left to wonder about some things, especially the paternity of Anouk, they are purposefully not revealed because they aren't relevant to the story. The film never strays from the characters and their interactions except to reveal something that is essential to the current story line. Overall, I would recommend this film to everyone. In a world increasingly divided because of our differences, we could all learn something from Vianne's tolerance and kindness.",Chocolat

But it seemed to me that Chocolat was not so much anti-religion or anti-tradition, as it was a more subtle look at when tradition works, and when it can be misused so that it no longer enriches, but stultifies.Also, the rootlessness which is portrayed as the opposite of what the traditional French village stands for, is not shown in entirely glowing terms.  And the endearing and solidifying features of the village are not overlooked.  Ultimately Chocolat proposes a merger of these two tendencies for the benefit of all.Fine performances, especially Judi Dench and the girl who plays Juliette Binoche's daughter.  I did find myself occasionally distracted by the decision to use, not subtitles nor dubbing, but English with faux French accents.The theme of the movie  of course is not original -- think, Mary Poppins for grown ups.",Chocolat

I was surprised at how many people joined me in an American theater for this and at their very positive responses. At then end, I could feel everyone thinking ""Give us more of this.  I think that besides the wonderful writing and acting and directing, the audience (and I) connected to the theme of the story: that if you are different and are courageous enough to be yourself and persevere, others who at first don't accept you will themselves change and like what they then see in themselves.Good natured, humorous yet moving.

316,tomoreilly,Empty calories,3,16 September 2001,"This movie is one of the most annoying I've seen in a long time. Very formulaic, predictable, and devoid of any sort of new idea or even interesting story-telling. The ""good"" characters are so pure, so loving, so open-minded, so obviously ""right"", while the oppressive, ignorant, repressed towns-folk are so very intolerant and just plain baaaadddd... it's no fun when the targets are that easy. I am not a Christian, but found the smug depiction of Catholics and their beliefs to be incredibly oversimplified. In the sermon near the end, the young priest states that we should focus on Christ's humanity instead of his divinity... as if Jesus himself is gonna walk into the chocolate shop and buy some chocolate bunnies or something. For a far more interesting examination of flesh versus spirit, see ""The Last Temptation of Christ"".",Chocolat
317,rpc90,Choco-lack,2,25 December 2001,"I rented this with the anticipation of a good film with high artistic quality after hearing all the great reviews and award nominations. I was pretty disappointed. The idea was very unoriginal (Pleasantville is another unpleasant, ""rebellious"" film). Also the acting was pretty poor, with bad French/English/American accents that didn't fit and overdubs that were done poorly. And then we get to the script- cheesy, predictable and very cliche (who says I can't use a skillet!). Anyway, I was disappointed by this film about chocolate, sex, and how evil men and religion are.",Chocolat
318,The Invisible Swordsman,A series of tired cliches strung together with no charm or subtlety.,2,8 August 2001,"""Chocolat"" is one of the most mediocre film to come out of Hollywood in years. It is nothing more than a series of cliches, and of ideas stolen from other, better movies. It is intellectually inferior to ""Charlie's Angels"". There are a few good performances, but the overall mix feels like the actors are competing with each other rather than working as an ensemble. Alfred Molina is as bad in this film as John Travolta was in ""Battlefield Earth"".The sad thing is, there was potential for a good movie here. The film does contain a worthwhile message, but it is portrayed with so little subtlety that's almost embarrassing to watch. The filmmakers have no respect whatsoever for the intelligence of the audience.What's most maddening about ""Chocolat"" is that it has been passed off as intellectual, artistic, independent and French when it is none of these things. It as much a Hollywood cookie-cutter commercial movie as ""The Mummy Returns"". The entirely undeserved Best Picture Academy award nomination (which should have gone to ""Cast Away"", ""Billy Elliot"", ""Thirteen Days"" or""O Brother, Where Art Thou?"") is, to say the least, suspicious.",Chocolat

Firstly i was rather confused by the way they changed the setting of the film from the early 1990s to 1959 a rather pointless change i thought. And secondly in the film Viannes mother is portrayed as a tribal wanderer type of person supposedly spreading chocolate around France whereas in the book she is a rather more complex superstitious character who is more interested in Tarot cards than chocolate and it is Vianne who is interested in chocolate. But there you go. Obviously the film was intended to be a little more happy and ""do gooder"" than the rather dark book. Nevertheless i thoroughly enjoyed the film and it remains one of my favourites.",Chocolat

Julliet Binoch is really gorgeous and is perfect for the part,all along the movie you feel like she is hiding something from the mystery of her eyes and the way she smiles.

The audience can choose the depth in which they wish to receive it. Little children may be entranced with the way chocolate looks when melted and stirred, whereas adults are entranced by the emotional impact of learning how to not deny one's self of the little pleasures in life (and also be captivated by melted chocolate!)

327,a-wheeler,Drivel (SPOILER ALERT),2,30 January 2006,"Finally got around to watching this one. Figured it couldn't be that bad-- enough awards/nominations were sloshed its way. It's nothing special, so if you don't see it, you're not doing yourself any disservice. In fact, I would really recommend that you rent something of substance instead.Written in the typical female idiom, it follows a woman who blows into a stuffy French town. She, of course, flaunts convention and is slightly puzzled when people don't like her. She has a small daughter and she is fiercely independent. The mayor doesn't like her because she doesn't go to church and her business, a Chocolatier, is open on Sundays. A dying old lady (Judi Dench), super-hunk gypsy (Johnny Depp) and an abused wife (?) rounds out the cast of characters, assuring academy awards and female viewers.The story goes in a fairly predictable line. The chocolate maker isn't welcome but she wins people over one by one with her sweets (some of them possessing powers, of course). She meets a kind and handsome wanderer they, of course, fall in love. Along the way, a woman who is mentally ill is cured by chocolates and leaves her abusive husband, the grumpy old woman becomes friendly and then dies. In the end, the whole town becomes a haven of happiness.All in all, not worth renting unless you intend to sleep through it while your girlfriend watches.",Chocolat

And, as long as your editing, can we have the villain be a child-abuser or wife-beater or something?

Who mentioned the fact that Quills was not in Frennch? Very few! It is important to note that the director of Chocolat wanted a mixture of accents to give the impression of differing identities.

335,heyyo,Oscar Hopeful? Nuts.,2,10 March 2001,"When I applied for a job as a reader at Miramax, they gave me this script to read.   Stupidly, I didn't bother to check and see if the film was in production before reading and giving my honest opinion.   I told them what many people have already said here, that it is a basic, three act romance, not exactly ground-breaking, and pretty obvious stuff.  Still, a sweet, simple movie.  The concept owes too much to better films ""Babette's Feast"" and ""Like Water for Chocolate"".   The screenplay could certainly have done without the stilted ""from translation"" dialogue.  The attitude towards small town life and the church was silly.   And I said some other stuff, can't remember what exactly, but I definitely passed on the script.  So when they revealed that this was not only in production, but their Oscar hopeful, I was pretty bummed.   Didn't get the job, of course.  Be warned, if you apply for a job as a reader, that this is a common tactic to see if your tastes are a good match with the company.  Not that you want to be a reader, since this is the most brain-sucking job out there.",Chocolat

337,StevieSun,Almost as magic as the book.,10,17 April 2001,"First all I have to say I followed this film from the time they filmed the party scene, because it was filmed here in Somerset. Really French!
I read the book last summer and the essence of the book is the magic. It's a fairy tale because of the magic, not just in the story but because of the story itself. I was worried that the magic would be lost when transfered to the screen. It wasn't. The whole film has kept the magical feel to it making this film a joy to watch. My only problem with the whole film (I can't believe I'm saying this), is a certain Mr. Depp. He sounded Irish but Roux wasn't Irish, or at least not that I remember. And Roux in the book had red hair. But despite that and the fact the large parts were missed out I loved this film. I have to add that the large parts missed out don't affect the story, unless you've read the book. I loved this film.
I have to just say, Judi Dench you were wonderful. And Hugh O'Conor, you were fantastic. Even in a skirt. I loved this film.Did I remember to add I love this film. If you get the chance to watch this film do.Know the madness  . . .",Chocolat

Juliette Binoche; that woman is amazing, her mere expressions give such life to the character that no words need to be said. Judi Dench also appeared brilliantly et la petit Victoire Thivisol shows just what the future generation of French actors is all about (she was excelent in Ponette - 1996). Johny Depp was a good choice for the part, even though I did not like how the marketing exploited on his image (because he's not THAT relevant in the film). Alfred Molina was true to the part and I must say I was quite surprised at what actress Lena Olin pulled through thru her supporting role (worth an Oscar nomination in my oppinion).That breath taking scenery could have been more exploited, specially the narrow streets of the pitoresque village. Still, the storyline was very well elaborate and entertaining. This is my new favourite movie for the month.",Chocolat

Okay, that may have been a little hard to swallow, but what is like a mouthful of your favourite sweets, this enchanting film should leave you with an indulging smile and a very strong urge to wonder past your local Darrell Lea outlet and stock up on those goodies that you haven't enjoyed in such a long time.Juliet Binoche is wonderful in the leading role.  That she has been nominated for an Oscar is no accident, and I would go as far as saying that she could be a surprise winner... perhaps not, given that she isn't American... okay, neither am I!  Johnny Depp I quite like, and he does come across in a very likeable manner in this.  However, I found their romance a little off the mark, with the true romance between two other characters never really given a chance until a brief narration made at the very end of the film.  Judi Dench gives a towering performance, bringing to the film a humility that so many modern actors can only strive to do.Most definitely two hours well spent, make sure you are stocked up at the Candy Bar before going in... you'll be glad for those malteasers once those delicious chocolates appear on screen.

Marvelous images, brilliant actors like Binoche, Dench and, yes, I also liked Molina playing the Compte! I expected more from Johnny Depp, for my taste his role is not the best for him to play. But I enjoyed watching that movie, and no-one can tell me that he wouldn't like to taste the ""Chocolat""!

That movie being a far superior product. Even the use of color (red in particular) as a symbolism was used throughout the movie.

Depp is as eccentric and wonderful as always.In fact the whole cast is fantastic. The story has all the elements of a wonderful fairy tale yet the perfect direction and the delightfully authentic french setting makes it serious movie.

I thought that the screenplay in this movie was amazing and the acting was lovely. Also, one thing I loved was that Johnny Depp was in it. He is one of my favorite actors and I loved seeing him in a non-creepy way. I mean, let's be honest he has played quite a few unusual and strange characters in the past. But, in this movie his character was relatively normal. Also, the plot I found very interesting. The characters all had their own personality shine out which is sometimes hard to find in movies. The movie also was very believable in the story. Lot's of movies you find that these things could never happen. However, in this movie I could totally see the characters in real life. I could also see the plot actually happening in real life. I find this an important aspect in a movie. The story should be able to captivate the audience and make some people relate to what's happening. This movie was a perfect example of that.

But i guess what is a love story without romance.the movie actually covers a wide variety of issues, such as a persons right to do what they want with their body, control of religion and religion used as a means of control. religion is actually a main theme in this movie, but it doesn't in anyway bible bash you, it's very light.recommending this for a night in, 8/10.",Chocolat

I was very surprised to see Joanne Harris (the author of the book) collaborated with the film.I know you usually have to make some changes to adapt a novel into a movie, but some of the changes made here were nonsensical.Don't read any further if you haven't read the book or seen the film. I'm about to discuss plot changes......Why was the villain changed from the priest to the mayor? The book is about temptation in Lent (with chocolate a metaphor for sex and other temptation). Having a priest as the oppressor makes infinite more sense.Why was Pantouffle changed from a rabbit into a kangaroo? A kangaroo in rural France? Why was the movie set in the 50s? In reading the book I never got the impression that it was set in the past. In fact, if you read one of Harris' other books, Blackberry Wine, set in the same town with some overlap of characters, it is obviously set in the 90s.What was it with the Mexican symbols & the different history of her Mother. The book was mysterious enough with the unnamed fears the mother was fleeing and the suggestion of child abduction. The Mexican story line was a let down.Why was Roux changed from a red-headed man with a Marseilles accent into dark-headed Johnny Depp with a bad Irish accent? Roux is the French word for red. If they wanted Johnny Depp in the role, he should have dyed his hair.Why did the story end with Vianne & Roux living happily every after? In the book, the wind changes and Vianne goes with it. Roux stays.I can keep going on and on....... This was a poor adaptation.",Chocolat

The novel was far better written than the movie. In the novel, the Black Man (or the main villain) is the priest, which changes the whole context of the story. And they destroyed the character of Armande, who in the novel wasn't cranky, but saucy, kind, and enjoyed ticking off the town priest. The Comte de Reynaud (who was Pere Reynaud) was a lot more conservative and anal retentive.The film (had you not read the book) was still delightful. It was different than most films.

Such a beautiful story and a beautiful cast, I always feel that the mark of a good film is when you cannot think of anyone who could have played each of the roles any better.

It is a pity that this film implies that a God-less way of life is more fun and more liberating.I have seen up close too many ruined lives of people who have turned their backs on God that I am now impatient of films that imply that God is the problem, not the solution. Single parenthood, despite the portrayal in the film, is not as much fun as it sounds.

Also it reminds of us a simple truth that we should not be afraid to be happy and hilarious, even though that is awkward at first.

I don't ""follow"" people who perform for me or people who tell them what to say.Starting with the story, I liked it from the first frame to the last. It is sweet, like chocolate but it can also be bitter also like chocolate. And decadent and frivolous and slightly sinful. Throughout the movie I tasted hints of Beauty and the Beast, Princess Bride, Mary Poppins and Peter Pan among other classic cinema treats. As with chocolates it has tasty overtones of all of them but remains its own singular blend of deliciousness.The production values are superb. Set mostly in a real French village it has an earthiness that can't be recreated in miniature models or digital effects, although some of the interior set designs at Shepperton studios seem a bit tacky and cheesy and the aerial shots of the village were in fact digitally enchanced. The lighting mood is lifelike, the use of music and sound effects is so spot on never once did it jar or distract. The action flow, editing, costumes (for the most part) all were as perfect as a forest scene from Snow White.All of this deserves a positive rating.But, like the dastardly villain, when it comes to rating the acting not all is so rosy in LaLa Land.Starting with the lead character Vianne, whose pivotal role wept for an actress blessed with a sense of magic and mystery and the free spirit of a pixie sprite, a Mary Poppins/Peter Pan if you will. Instead we get a lackluster performance by billionaire Juliette Binoche looking like a billionaire who just interrupted her shopping trip on Rodeo Drive to walk woodenly around a movie set in expensive designer dresses looking like none other than Juliette Binoche. I'm usually not one for movie remakes but here's one that screams to be remade with a less clueless actress cast as Vianne, perhaps Barbra Streisand (I'm kidding of course).The other lead character, Comte de Reynaud, acted by Alfred Molina was a comic book caricature but then again this is a fantasy movie so I'll tolerate his over-the-top slapstick, but I did find what he did to the character boring. As with Ms. Binoche, it's hard to get into a movie when you can't get out of your head that you're watching multi-millionaire actors.Ditto for Judi Dench as Armande. No matter what the role, if Judi Dench is in it you're going to be watching Judi Dench play Judi Dench. To give you an idea how expendable her role was when she finally died it seemed to be the biggest ""ho hum"" moment in theater history. No one even said ""oh darn she's dead"".That being the case I dreaded the appearance of Johnny Depp, expecting all of the above and in spades. Mr. Depp is infamous for playing himself in every role and it's virtually impossible to separate his Hollywood persona from what he does on screen. His character, Roux, doesn't even make an appearance until 52 minutes into the movie and what's this, he's not mumbling, or acting weird, or primping himself, or even acting like actor Johnny Depp. His portrayal is actually subtle and nuanced and believable. And likable. Mon Dieu! He almost single-handedly made up for a whole lot of bad casting decisions.He almost does but not completely. Hugh O'Conor STEALS the entire movie and one is continually left with the sinful desire to see more of him. His fidgety nervousness and blushed cheeks have you wondering what mortal pleasures he's contemplating while in the darkened confessional or standing upright behind the solid wood pulpit. Not since Dustin Hoffman's brilliant ""gulp"" in Mrs. Robinson's sun room has an actor so brilliantly captured the essence of a naive and conflicted young man who is the odd cog in everyone else's wheel. Yet unlike the other look-at-me celebrities pretending to act like they are someone else, Mr. O'Conor come across like he's not really acting, that he really is Pere Henri and you just want to jump naked into the confessional with him and lip sync ""You Ain't Nothin' But A Hound Dog"" with him... the highest compliment that could be paid to any actor.The only quirky thing that threw this movie off balance a little bit for me was the odd setting for that type of river in the town of Flavigny sur Ozerain, which from all of the establishing camera angle views does not seem like it would be on the banks of a river straight out of Deliverance. It doesn't look very French or like it would flow adjacent to such a village.I liked this movie despite some miscast roles but will still take away extra points for the unapologetic animal abuse portrayal (feeding chocolate to dogs can kill them) and the fact that it is a Harvey Weinstein movie and it hasn't been banned. Hmm, maybe there is a connection after all to Weinstein, certain women's casting assignments and abusing dogs?",Chocolat
357,haythorn,Pretension of the highest order,2,3 September 2001,This was a sophomoric conceit full of cliches and manipulations. The plot was facile and the acting wooden.

It can't be that bad!""I am an action/western/mystery type of guy and didn't think there was any chance I would like this movie. I was very surprised! I got caught up in the ""What are they going to do next?"" stuff and was surprised at almost every turn. And it really wasn't along the lines of the dopey love story movies that I really hate.And now my strongest recommendation: I can't wait to see this movie again to see what all I missed the first time.

362,Zealandia,If you've read the book you'll be disappointed in the movie,5,25 March 2001,If you want to see a 'Disney-ised' version of this story then 'Chocolat' the movie is for you. The movie leaves too many loose ends and many of the characters are not given time to develop to their full potential and are merely a backdrop to the central love story. The casting of Dame Judi Dench as 'Armande' is one of the few things that saves the movie. While it is almost impossible to compare books to movies I felt that the book had so much more depth - depth which the movie only skimmed the surface of. 'Chocolat' is a nice movie - it could have been a great one.,Chocolat
363,vince1,"Gooey stuff, Dame Judi Dench saves the day.",4,8 January 2001,"This movie was made by Americans, photographed mostly in England, with pretensions of ""frenchness"".

365,aymo2000,Wonderful and Positive,10,3 January 2001,Lasse Hallstrom has woven together an amazing story that seems too trite and small if you just read random synopses of the film.Julliette Binoche radiates like she has stepped out of the Golden Age of Hollywood and Alfred Molina's controlled (but not really) view of the world and his duty is stunning.It's a story in an an era when too many films look for a quick fix in 90 minutes or less or rely on computer enhanced special effects.

366,ruthmuttlebury,It is OK to be Different!,8,16 April 2006,"A good kick up the backside for Catholic hypocrisy. Such a message in a film like this was long over-due. Exemplary proof that single parents can often do a far better job than those people trapped within the so-called respectable confines of a 'conventional family'.For too long we have been brainwashed in the 'rights and wrongs' of how to live a normal life (whatever normal is!) and here, when questioned, the mother responds to the daughter: ""It's not easy being different."" True - but she is a stronger mother than the vain kittens who parade under the title of 'respectable housewife' (or kept, lazy women) who surround her, gossipping on street corners or in the hairdressers: suppressed and repressed by men who follow the hollow 'Alpha Male' image of the Mayor (which proves to be a pretty weak effort when he is found prostrate in the shop window early one morning, plastered in chocolate).And that is what confuses me about Catholic hypocrisy: the 'Madonna' was basically a single mother but is worshipped the world over. Real, live single mothers are lambasted. 'Chocolat' shows us the difference. And it is OK to be 'different'.",Chocolat
367,tierney,the most predictable movie ever made,4,3 March 2001,This movie is very cute and nice and I would have liked it more IF it was on television.

370,Hyperion,Most fun I've had in a movie since my date with Becky Martin,7,4 March 2001,"""Chocolat"" was the last movie of the five Oscar contenders I had to see.  I went with some doubt that I would like it; it just didn't seem like a great movie.  However, I and my compadres had a great time watching this picture. The movie was light and airy, and never really took itself too seriously. The characters are a bit too stereotyped to actually exist in real life, and there is a Magic-Realism aspect to the film that is never explored beyond a cursory level.  All that doesn't matter, though, because this film is not one you want to ponder.  ""Chocolat"" works because it's fun to watch.  The plot doesn't get too leaden with melodrama,and there are plenty of scenes designed to get cheers.  This is a movie where you root for the good guys, and boo the bad ones.  Another great bit of fun was that every time anything chocolate appeared on screen, we yelled out ""Chocolat!"" in our best Juliette Binoche impersonations.  By the end of the picture we had several rows of people doing it.  Much like ""The Rocky Horror Picture Show"", this seemed to improve the experience greatly.  When it is all said and done, I am not sure if the movie should have been an Oscar nominee (Miramax probably had more to do with that), but it certainly was a joy to watch.Hyperion",Chocolat

It is gorgeous by the unbelievable performances of Juliette Binoche, Judi Dench and Carie Anne Moss. Director who also directed Cider House Rules (1999)which I believe was one of the best in 1999 has created a lovely fairy tale.",Chocolat
373,ericschick,I couldn't possibly fathom a more annoying film,1,7 June 2007,"If this film were a person it would be a middle aged woman with a pill addiction, teaching a class called ""let crystals and magnets heal your sex life"", with a bumper-sticker that reads ""cats are people too"". It would be a baby-booming dingbat with a bachelors degree in feminine studies, who keeps wondering why she can't find The Da Vinci Code in the Non-Fiction/History section of her local Chapters/Starbucks. Which she frequents in the sub-conscious hope that someone may overhear and be impressed by her blabbing loudly about the ""sacred feminine"" and extolling its virtues over the ""patriarchal and oppressive Judeo/Christian worldview of Western Civilization"". So if that is the kind of person that you are impressed by, you will probably enjoy this film very much.p.s. if this movie were a person, it would be reading ""The Mists of Avalon"", in the waiting room of its psychiatrists office.",Chocolat
374,manyblackbears,I loved it,10,25 June 2006,"This is an excellent movie. Juliette's character is wonderful and of Course Johnny Depp makes a great Gyspy vagabond. I have watched this movie over 6 times already and never get sick of it,There is something mysterious that keeps drawing me to watch it again and again. It is funny, warm, and very interesting from start to finish. The Chocolate makes you drool with hunger. Everyone will enjoy this movie.Even my husband, who normally likes action and thrillers sat through the entire movie and said he enjoyed it. I would have to say that this movie was Juliettes best performance and definitely deserved and Oscar for it. Take a chance and watch it as you will be pleasantly pleased.",Chocolat
375,subligaria,"Chocolat is similar to the movie Pleasantville, only classier, and it seems more realistic.",9,27 March 2001,"I would have rated this movie, Chocolat, a full 10, if not for one thing. That one thing is as follows-- it reminds me too much of a previous movie, Pleasantville, which- don't get me wrong- I would definitely recommend to anyone who asked, and people who like Chocolat might like Pleasantville as well. Both movies are about the humdrum becoming interesting, and outsiders finding where they fit in, which, by the way, are very prevalent themes in my own life, especially now that I'm in college. But Chocolat is definitely a far classier movie, one in which the characters have far more texture, as well as one with which I can identify far more readily. Vianne, the chocolaterie owner, for instance, reminds me of me, has my peculiarity, my strong-woman-type free will, as does Luc's grandmother, Armande. Josephine, the abused wife, also reminds me of me, in that at first, she is discouraged from being herself, but then she becomes friends with someone who convinces her that those who discourage her from being herself, are all wrong, and then she becomes a strong, independent woman like Vianne. Armande and Vianne also remind me of me in that they are intelligent, creative, eccentric people who start out as outsiders but then find their place in society without ever having to change who they are. And society, when it finds that Armande and Vianne won't change, begins to adapt",Chocolat
376,juditnavarro,The perfect movie,10,17 April 2020,"The setting, actors and dynamic is amazing. Each actor plays a wonderful part and there is the perfect mix of laughter and sad parts. It has become one of my favorite movies by far. Also, the music and sound is remarkable and central to the story.
It is subtle in its symbolisms yet fully understandable; a story about freedom, real tranquility, love, façade and happiness.
It doesn't conform to expectations and plays a very independent tale, still following a familiar narrative.
It follows and portrays a wonderful didactic message while not being too abusive or intrusive in its ideology.Finally, it is one of those movies that can't be seen enough or felt deeper, it definitely leaves it's personal mark. It reminds me of Edward Scissorhands, not sure if it is because it feels familiar, understanding and kind throughout, or because it represents a similar tale of a different and independent character trying to live in a society with its norms and limits.
I can't credit this movie enough, it is so real and relatable yet it leaves you aching for more.
A beautiful piece of work",Chocolat
377,auntydale,delightful!,9,12 September 2003,"Went in not expecting much but this turned out to be a delightful and entertaining film.  It has just the right amount of whimsy.  The drama is in context - not too preachy as long as you don't take it too seriously.  Juliet Binoche is luminescent.  Alfred Molina and Judy Dench are terrific along with the rest of the supporting cast.  After all of the quirky characters he has played in the past, it's nice to see Johnny Depp just be the man for a change. I highly recommend this film!",Chocolat
378,nessunaltro,Nah - skip the dessert,5,3 December 2006,"The real test of whether you can trust user comments on sites like Amazon or IMDb is not when you're reading those of a good movie or book - but when you reading those concerning a movie like this one which isn't all that good but still gets glowing comments.It's a chick movie. Predictable, all the right opinions - and boredom starts gliding in after 30 minutes when we have to hear the tale of the chocolate maker's ancestors.I waited for something to break the sameness - but it never really arrived.So my wife watched on while I went for tea and popcorn - but eventually we both agreed in being somewhat disappointed, having read the hype beforehand.",Chocolat

Juliette Binoche is more beautiful on the inside than out, thanks to a wonderful worldliness and strength that her character exhibits. Johnny Depp showed me that he can easily be the master of ""cool.""

381,tanzer27,"Nazis are bad, chocolate is good",6,18 August 2001,"As the film began, I enjoyed the fairy tale quality of the story. The narration, the description of the town made it all sound so quaint. I was ready to be charmed. Unfortunately, as the film continued, I found distasteful the similarity of the small town behavior with those of Nazis. (Maybe this was the point?)I also failed to see the charm in a movie that only showed healthy relationships between women.The wind metaphor is a bit overdone. (I felt I was being clubbed with the ""wind of change"".) It was consistent, but too windy.It's a small thing, but why do we have to put up with an English language film, set in France with people who speak with accents? Tiresome.On the other hand, there were some good performances -- Juliette Binoche and Johnny Depp (with a weak Irish accent?). Judy Dench was wonderful.**********Spoiler Information follows*************Could they have made Armande Voizin's (Judy Dench) death more predictable or pathetic?

382,lauracr2,A healing place,9,21 August 2001,"Chocolat is for all types because of it's beautifully crafted scenes, script, score and actors. But, the real gem is the healing that takes place in front of the eyes of the audience. So many characters are healed from the restrictions of their upbringings and it's really beautiful to see. Even the most harmful characters to themselves and others are portrayed in a compassionate way. And the victims are shown their real strengths. The chocolate shop symbolizes a place where you don't need to be ashamed of who you really are deep down inside. The place where your true nature is allowed to be free like a bird or a gypsy. Johny Depp's song is a song the soul sings when it rejoices and plays. I loved this movie. On a personal note, the character who had an abusive husband was the most poignant. She shows battered women they can survive, escape, heal, triumph and help others. What a realistic portrayal!! You would think she actually survived something like that in real life!",Chocolat
383,cary2,Over-Rated Puff,3,2 September 2001,"After being encouraged to see this movie for months by friends, I finally rented the DVD expecting the best.It is odd how sometimes so many things can be so wrong with a movie that one spends as much time thinking about it afterward as a good movie.  This is the case with ""Chocolat"" for me.While I fully expected a ""Romance Film"" from a romance novel, I never thought a film with such a fine cast could devolve so quickly into such a mire of mindless, poorly evolving fluff and heavyhanded cliche.  With the exception of the ""Fabio"" morph, all of the male characters in this story are ineffectual at best, and dangerous oafs at worst.  The women are all blocked out as strong and suffering the buffoonery of the village men with quiet suffering until their triumph brings a circus to the town square.The fact that this film garnered Oscar recognition is somewhat depressing to me. I can only take hope from reviews I have read here and elsewhere that so many others see through the commercialized hack job that Hollywood has done here.",Chocolat
384,ungurvictor,This is a disappointment for me,6,19 December 2006,"I've watched this movie last night, after some months void of any good movies, hoping for a nice one, making illusions...The music is quite good, the actors are quite good, the director is a quite good one... u can see where this is going.... nothing stands out from this movie. In the beginning of the movie you are told the action takes place in a French town, but nobody seems to speak French. Maybe you could get used to that but they seem to want to remind you that it is France where they are so they greet in French, and have a slight French accent in their English. You must think I'm obsessed with language but while watching the movie the used language kept distracting my attention.Speaking about the characters... one can not be disappointed by their performance, the weakest one is the one of mister Molina(well, it is true, the character itself couldn't provide an opportunity for better acting), the mayor who lies about his wife and hates Mme. Rocher for bringing chocolate into peoples lives and by this attempting to change their traditional lives, not only seams fake. Vianne Rocher also got me thinking about why I watched that movie, having a strange story, told in a very naive way (the thing with the Mayans and stuff).She is also 3/4 of the movie a non-profound person, happily smiling at the citizen and feeding them chocolate.After she ""kills"" Armande Voisin she tries to get a bit deeper but fails.It all seems so fake again.I would have some things to say about misses Moss's character and the one of Johnny Depp but I think I will get a lot of reader's mad if I haven't already.If you've liked or loved the movie anyway I suggest u watch Jeunet's ""Amelie"" which would be a better movie with some similarities with ""Chocolat"".",Chocolat

389,ishka2003,Chocolat is a terrible movie,3,26 March 2008,"Probably like many other people, I was urged by my friends to see this movie. They reassured me that it was an amazing film, and the title has some element of mystery/art house feel, like a foreign movie except in English. So I took up their half-remembered goadings and channeled that energy vaguely, yet meaningfully, into a late-night viewing session. That's right, this is the one where you expect the medium of film to keep you awake and forgetful of your responsibilites for the next day.And from beginning to the end I was reminded by every line of unconvincing, unmotivated dialogue of the vast amount of things, both important and unimportant, that comprised my early morning, now late-afternoonish, tasks. And yet I couldn't look away, because not unlike a hot tub that malfunctions in the middle of you're being in it, you keep waiting to see if it will kick up again no matter how cold you get and disappointed you get. I guess I kept waiting for Chocolat's talented cast to explain their presence in this film.They didn't, but if the writers had made lines for them to say how dissatisfied they were with the dialogue they were given, maybe we would have had some motivation from the characters. Instead the actors, Depp and Moss especially, look like they're struggling to find a way to express something unexpected through their lines. And in this film it's important to try at least, since the number of interactions the characters have with each other are as wildly disjointed as they are sparse. One minute people are meeting each other for the first time, then they spell out very carefully, as if from a ""Character Psychology for Dummies"" textbook, the main, deeply personal problems they face (""problem"" in the singular is probably better for most of them), and how grateful they are to finally open up to their savior. And don't give me the 'the magical chocolate made them do it' thing. These characters are one dimensional regardless of whether or when they've eaten the stuff.But don't get me wrong. I'm not hating the movie for being something other than what it is. It's a kind of fairy tale, of course, and I love fairy tales, especially complicated ones of multiple meanings, even with a single narrator. A serious, dramatic fairy tale, however, where the difficulty and ambiguity of transformation doesn't exist because motivations are single-tiered and seemingly unalterable (until the script cues that the time for fundamental change is nigh), then the fairy tale fails. The characters are just there. You remain uninvested in them, they in each other and in themselves. You get the feeling that the challenge, the difficulty, even the joke happened sometime before or after you were watching.Of course, the movie has its wrong points, the few instances of violence, or danger, or desperation. But these are disjointed, and seem to be the beginnings, the hints of deeper conversations between characters rather than the end. Taken in context, they seem like lip service to character formation.I swear, the most promising and potentially transformative interactions are brought up and resolved in mere moments, leaving me thinking that at least the actors got some chocolate out of this movie. All I got was a 3AM hunger for chocolate whose form I can only communicate through allusions to a movie I have already resolved not to see again.",Chocolat

Good performances from the leads..although some of the writing left something to be desired. I can't belive this movie was nominated for so many oscars!

391,harryyabbats,So anti-tradition/Catholic even non-Christians don't like it!,1,22 September 2010,"I knew nothing of this movie before seeing it on an international flight the other day. I cannot say I am surprised at the anti-Catholic bias of secularist's with an agenda. This movie thwarts more than religion, it, as so many opinion pieces do nowadays, wants to show traditional life, morays, customs and attitudes as being provincial, narrow-minded and detrimental to the human condition and spirit. This movie goes on to place in high honor the iconoclast's role in reshaping and ""rectifying"" centuries of ""injustice"" and ""intolerance"". It does this by making all the failings of the ""outsider"" - the iconoclast, virtuous qualities. The crude old lady (Judy Dench) who admits her daughter won't have anything to do with her because she drinks and swears and doesn't care what others think, or the main character (Juliette Binoche) who blows into town and promptly turns her nose up at local custom and then acts surprised when some modicum of resistance presents itself to her style, both refuse to recognize other people's sensibilities. This assault is later furthered by Johnny Depp's character, the ""noble vagabond"", who, in his open-mindedness, simply asks Juliette Binoche why she cares what the ""narrow-minded"" villagers think. This brings me to what is what is most grating and at the same time predictable, the intransigence of all these ""noble spirits"" who muddle through, putting aside any effort to assimilate or acculturate and hold on to their own biases in the name of what they so selfishly perceive as open-mindedness. The movie promotes the nobility of breaking social morays and not being satisfied until people accept it. The story demands everyone find the newcomer or the outsider's way acceptable and further embrace it. And it also wants to show the ""sole"" defender of tradition as being an intolerant hypocrite who can manipulate a young priest by demanding he edit his sermons. So while this movie is decidedly anti-Catholic it is also patently anti-tradition and while the Church's values and customs are always ripe for fodder in Hollywood, I get the feeling the producers would be just as happy to ask me to accept and enjoy any other form of social deviance ""for my own good"" - like being served food by a kid with metal through her lips, nose and eyebrows while saying to myself: ""Good for her! She's a real individual!"" And while I have no use for the story or the fact you hear nary a French accent or a sing-songy ""bonjour"" as you would at the beginning of every real human interaction in France, as someone who has been through scores of French villages over the years, I can say at least the scenery is believable. I did read one review by a French native who said in the time period this movie is supposed to represent, virtually all the villages were administered by communists, and I can say that the story writer's seeming grudge against ""rural Catholic France"" is deeply unfounded and maybe more a sign of some paranoia. In reality you find churches in every village, most capable of holding hundreds for Mass, being populated by only a few dozen people on Sunday. All art including the art of writing fiction has to connect or reflect reality at some point to be meaningful to the astute person, and this movie does not, thereby rendering it irrelevant at best.",Chocolat
392,papramorgo,Fairy tale with a human touch,8,30 December 2008,"I always enjoy films that talk about problems of ""small"" people; they are much easier to relate to than fictional characters of great power.Chocolat is an enchanting movie with a lot of interesting subplots that support (and for most part make up) the story of Vianne and Anouk. In this sense it reminds me a lot of Dogville, which starts in a very similar setting; a woman arriving to a small town with a closed community.The movie never takes itself too serious to be believable but real people with real problems can easily reflect and relate to the characters in the movie. It also leaves itself up for interpretation depending on the side from which we are looking at it.For me the lesson learned that generosity and patience can pay off, and that the most dangerous wrongdoers are the ones, who are sure they are doing the right thing.Acting is for the most part superb, but for me less known faces could have made the movie more believable (Carrie-Ann Moss particularly reminds me of the Matrix). But most of all the script and the storytelling gives the power and the charm of the movie and the acting is the chili and the spices on the top of the chocolate. A great story is the best recipe for a great film.Altogether a great Sunday Evening feel-good movie that can make a long winter evenings pleasant and enjoyable.",Chocolat
393,sbmicks,Magical Movie,9,14 June 2010,"The movie Chocolat is a magical tale of a small village with many rules on how villagers are to live and act and behave. Then along comes a woman who enters their world and turns it upside down by allowing them to experience life to the fullest after opening a chocolaterie. As the villagers become more and more tempted to visit her shop, she is able to open their eyes through her chocolate to a world completely different from what they know and trust. At the same time, Vianne, the owner of the chocolaterie, struggles with her own desires as she is forced to follow the North wind as her mother did. Only when she decides to allow her mother's spirit alone to move on, does she begin to experience her own happiness. The theme of the story is about love and the experiences of life even if we must go against the ways of tradition and the past. It's about finding out what makes us happy and working towards it while respecting others. The major characters include the mayor (Alfred Molina) of the village who is always trying to do what is right even though his own private world is that of despair. The conflict between him and Vianne (Juliette Binoche) is very evident. Then the character Roux (Johnny Depp) is considered a ""river rat"" by the villagers but ends up as Vianne's own personal piece of chocolate that opens her eyes to happiness. Josephine (Lena Olin) is another woman in the village whose husband, Serge (Peter Stormare), is very abusive and when given the opportunity to leave and begin working with Vianne, she jumps on it. Armande (Judi Dench) is the landlord of Chocolatery and is faced with a broken relationship with her daughter. Armande does what she wants and says what she wants and her witty comments immediately draw you in. This movie is much more than romance, it's magic through the guilty pleasures of chocolate. The actors and actresses make you feel like you are right there wanting to experience life as they wish to. The costumes and setting throughout the movie is beautiful and make a remarkable contribution to the movie. The setting is important to this movie because it helps you become drawn in like you are truly there in this small village. The village buildings are beautiful as well as many other locations throughout the movie. The costumes are important as everyone wears very dull colors while Vianne (the outsider) wears red heals and bright colors. The movie is a must see and is very entertaining. The way the chocolate scene's become magical makes you want to be right there with her and become a part of it.",Chocolat
394,evagaida,Predictability Lets it Down,6,20 February 2011,"It's too corny to be a true masterpiece of that kind of ""quirky"" genre, I know this film is often compared to Amelie, and in this comparison I think Chocolat can be seen as more predictable.The most unfortunate thing about this film is that for some reason it had to be set in France. Even though the characters speak English (with really bad fake French accents)and it could easily have been set in Ireland. In my opinion that would have been much better, the religious piousness fits, the traditional values, the Irish travellers.The overall feel of the film ends up being like your average feel-good family film and I don't think that does the book justice. Parts of the plot remain unresolved; why does Caroline *suddenly* change her mind about Vianne at the end?All this said, the acting on the whole is well done and does the characters justice, and the film is an enjoyable watch, for what it is.",Chocolat
395,clrrjr,Sad interpretation of the original story.,1,25 March 2004,"This movie missed the whole point of the book!  This was not a battle between the mayor and the storeowner.  It was a battle between religious dictations and independent freedoms.  The mayor, who is the second major character of the movie wasn't even part of the original story!  I suppose the producers did not wish to offend the church going crowd by incorporating a true battle of wills between the candy shop owner and the Catholic Priest! Johnny Depp's character was nothing more than a minor note and really has nothing to do with the original plot.  The book was truly inspiring and delightful.  Forget the movie... read the book!  The store has depth, personal growth and inspiration throughout.  It is about a story of women who stands up for herself and her beliefs.",Chocolat
396,mir-te,What a wise and beautiful movie!,10,16 February 2004,"I saw Chocolat again last night. I had forgotten how lovely a movie it is! People need stories like this these days.Some other viewers have complained about the predictability of the plot. I don't think it's any more predictable than an average Hollywood film; I find most action films much more predictable and shallow.The most beautiful thing about the movie (as about Hallström movies generally) is the wise, warm-hearted story about things that matter: love, sincerity, tolerance, standing up for the things you believe are righteous and good, and enjoying the simple pleasures in life, like a good dinner with friends, or like chocolate :) And Hallström tells his stories so delicately, in his very own style, with fine nuances and a twinkle of humour in his eye. Binoche, Dench, Depp, Molina, Thivisol etc. are fantastic.
I'm so glad I saw the movie. It always makes me think and feel a lot.",Chocolat
397,imdb5-2,Too Sweet is too sweet,4,30 May 2004,"Sometimes filmmakers want so badly for the audience to see what they see that they set up characters in the world of make believe and try to make us believe it exists. In this little surreal movie, everything is just so blisteringly sweet that it can make you nauseous. This isn't a terrible movie but it's a surreal fantasy that isn't as substantive as others like to think. Oooh, have fun a little bit and religion can be stifling and in a vacuum. Deep. Very deep.While the point of this film is to enjoy one's life, too much was centered on the horror, yes the horror, of opening up a chocolate shop. Yes, we got the point about what the shop represents but the overreaction right from the beginning sets the tone of this movie. Everything is overly sweet, overly emotional, overly dramatic and get used to it.Bottom line is that these are like donuts that are too sweet. You kind of like the donuts but you just get sick thinking trying to eat them that you eventually put them down and realize you're better off looking elsewhere. Predictable story. Worth a rental if you need a feel good movie you haven't seen but don't think you're getting a masterpiece.",Chocolat
398,villemarsvin,Excellent performance and story,10,1 July 2004,"This story is told with excellent feeling and elegance. The actors have really put in a lot of experience in there performances.Lasse Hallstrom also gave the whole movie a touch of his excellent sensitivity for the actor's talents. Lasse lets actors make adjustments to the story, which enhances the impression of the characters that are in the film. The story is excellent told and the different personnel stories are very elegant woven together. This is not just a ""standard movie"" where actors just have to deliver their lines but a delicate interaction of the different characters personalities.",Chocolat

401,MiddleAgedMom,A sweet mixture,7,24 January 2011,"Here's a recipe for Chocolat: combine one part Babette's Feast and one part Footloose. Add two tablespoons of Like Water for Chocolate and stir.I really enjoyed Chocolat. The acting is great, and, even with occasional dark elements, the story is sweet. But I kept feeling like I had seen this movie before. Babette's Feast, Footloose and Chocolat all bring nonconformist newcomers to small, conservative communities, where a clash is inevitable. As in Like Water for Chocolate, Vianne's creations work a seeming magic on those who taste them... and like Tita, Vianne seems to be unable to control her destiny. Tita, in Like Water for Chocolate, was unable to marry because of her mother's control. Vianne follows in her mother's footsteps, moving to a new place whenever the north wind blows.As a Christian, I was disappointed by the portrayal of Christians in this movie -- sour and hard-hearted, opposites of Vianne, a sparkling, loving woman who is not a Christian. But I don't blame the film-makers, and I don't count my disappointment as ""points off"" my rating of this film. Unfortunately, such a picture of Christians is sometimes justified by our behavior; we would do well to look in the mirror if we feel hurt by how we are portrayed in movies like this. Still, Vianne seems determined to set herself at odds with the Christians from the get-go, and the Christians are more conservative than any I personally know. And would Lenten fasts in France in 1959 really be unbroken even on Sundays? I was raised in the Episcopal church in the 1970s and '80s and was taught that Sundays, even during Lent, were feast days.I wasn't sorry I watched Chocolat. I'd even view it again. But before I do, I think I'll re-watch Babette's Feast. As a food film, I remember it as more satisfying fare.",Chocolat
402,chris-2055,cacao saves the day,8,20 December 2005,"It is misleading to suggest that this movie makes a fool or bad guy out of religion/Christianity. The movie simply portrays one of the many instances by which religion vis-a-vis Christianity can be manipulated by those with personal agendas to attempt to force others into particular lifestyles. The movie might have been a bit trite, but it was well done and entertaining. a much more significant problem than the treatment of Christianity was the treatment of peripheral characters, about whom we learn very little. aside from the woman running the chocolate shop and the town mayor, all of the other dynamic characters remain too flat. I would have loved to have known more about the all of these characters, with a solid cast of actors such as were present here, it really could've been accomplished with just a bit more dialogue, so long as it was done right. nevertheless, the movie was far, far better than a 2.",Chocolat
403,terriertrimmer,"music in the picture ""Chocolat""",10,20 February 2005,"I really enjoyed the movie. I would like a list of the music used. My son is a guitarist and I would love for him to hear and learn some of the beautiful music on the soundtrack, particularly the music played by the ""boat people"" that the characters danced to and the latter pieces in the film. Is there information available about the names of the compositions and the composers. Is it possible to purchase the soundtrack? As the parent of a musician I understand the ability of the music to both further the plot and help set the mood of each scene. The background music in this film is haunting and contains elements of Latin jazz and gypsy music. The music has very definite appeal for those who appreciate ethnic and instrumental melodies which are reminiscent of the gypsy ballads of 19th century Europe.Thank you!! Cindy",Chocolat
404,lida_mila,Thought provoking story,10,26 September 2005,"I have only seen this movie for the first time today. I have to admit that I hesitated somewhat as I did not believe I would like it because it was described to me as a 'chick flick', a genre I do not subscribe to even though I am a girl. How wrong was that description. I loved the film, the story, the scenery. Such genuine & diverse characters. The actors chosen were perfect for their roles, I cannot imagine anyone else playing the parts. The DVD I had was borrowed, but I intend to buy a copy for myself as it would fit into my small library of movies. I have to see it again & this time I will share the experience with my partner as I know he will appreciate the story. Lida",Chocolat
405,hotsaucejr12341,awesome,8,25 September 2014,"Chocolate was in my eyes a great movie. I'm typically not a fan of movies like these but to watch the characters grow and change overtime was just truly amazing. The main character, Vianne, over came the hardship from the people in the village. Most of the people didn't accept her because they were told by the mayor of the town, who is a huge religious man,that she was no good due to the fact she was opening a chocolate store around the time Lent was beginning. Few people would go into the shop and then less and less started to show because they were being turned against her. She was ready to give it all up and runaway to another new town with her daughter but the friends she made had stood up for her and even had changed the mayors opinion of her. The way she even helped out the older woman to live her last few moments of life to the fullest was just truly amazing even though she was dying pretty fast from her diabetes. This movie is something i would recommend to people who want to watch a good story of characters unfold and how everyone comes together to love one another",Chocolat

No originality, all this is, is a money fueled film packed to the brim with ""elite"" producers and production companies shoving it down our throats.",Chocolat
407,marywatkins-72706,Great story,10,19 November 2015,"""Chocolat"" was directed by Lasse Hallstrom, a man with a developed sense to present human emotion and weakness. Juliette and Judi play two women with strong opinions and a hard-guard because of fear of being injured. The town scene, accompanied with music, creates an atmosphere as if time has stopped. Residents secretly want to go forward, toward something else but well rooted they stay anchored. The shop is located on the square, opposite the church, symbolically portraying the battle that follows. A lot of messages are here, torn by the old way of life and the desire to go into hiding, afraid of the uncertainty that the new time brings and how the smallest thing can make the greatest difference.

408,kevinsgift_shop,Chocolat good,9,13 August 2005,"At first, I thought chocolat would be one of those European films that we Americans don't understand because of the culture differences. After the initial introduction, the movie settled down into a pace where it quietly included past European and hence American superstitions and behaviors. Aristocracy and the hardships of labor are entwined with the love and devotion of family and friends. But not without a price. As the characters emerge you will fall for this romantic drama. This film requires no detailed knowledge of history or culture. A great film for family, dates, or just to be entertained but without the over the top explosions.",Chocolat
409,sodyoz,Disappointing - not for the impatient,4,29 September 2005,"The movie began with promise. The scenery and direction seemed very good. The acting was especially good. The film had cute quirks like the rotating wheel that determines the chocolate you like. However, the movie lacked pace. For over an hour, the plot just plods along until *finally* Jonny Depp enters as a major character. I checked the remaining time left on the DVD and was left thinking, ""Hang on - not another hour of this?"".I stopped watching it after 70 minutes in spite of its good points - I just couldn't bear to watch anymore. When it boils down to it - the screenplay let it down.Not for the impatient.",Chocolat
410,krisforprez,A film that excels at guessing your favorite.,7,8 January 2006,"Chocolat, like its rich, creamy namesake, is charming, and satisfying. Given the billing of actors, and the film's director (Lasse Hallstrom of The Cider House Rules) and production team (the Weinstein brothers), one would expect the film to be well put-together, and it is.Judi Dench is, as always, impeccable. She surely is one of the most naturally- gifted actors to grace the screen. Juliette Binoche carries her part consistently, however, there were brief flashes when I thought she looked a little too forced in the role of benevolent chocolatier.I personally felt that it was the work of the supporting actors that stole the show: The aforementioned Judi Dench; Alfred Molina as the Comte who controls the town, but, in the end, cannot control himself; Lena Olin as the kicked-while-she's-down wife; Johnny Depp, sublimely heavenly as the ""river rat""/love interest and who could forget Victoire Thivisol as the guileless daughter Anouk.These actors bring a quality to this film, yet I felt that some moments in the movie were a little contrived and erring slightly on corny- for example *spoiler* Towards the end of the film, the scene in which several brave townspeople band together to help make chocolate treats for an upcoming festival seems designed to stir up ""warm fuzzies"" inside viewers. Also, it sometimes seems as if Vienne fixes the lives of the villagers a little too quickly and neatly- which is why this film could be seen as attempting to pander to an audience that wishes to be fulfilled in an uplifting, satisfying way.This film was also marketed as a comedy, and the first half fits the bill perfectly. Naturally, it's not a laugh-a-minute, but there are many funny lines that make you giggle.OK, so it can be a little corny at moments. However, as Chocolat progresses, issues such as acceptance, tolerance, the breaking of archaic tradition, and the finding of inner strength, particularly in women, are well explored.All in all, Chocolat is a fine film that will be enjoyed by many people, almost as satisfying as their favorite chocolate treat.",Chocolat
411,kruiningen,the meaning of life....,8,28 November 2005,"Wonderful movie, Juliette Binoche (Vianne) is great, Johny Depp (Roux) is gorgeous. This is what was meant with what life should be. In the beautiful surroundings of a pitoresque village. The movie takes you to France, makes you part of the daily life of Vianne and her daughter Anouk, although it is only sound and vision, you can taste, smell and feel the story, you'll become a part of it. The music is also a pleasure to listen at. Not many movies made me feel like I was a part of it. It now want to see more of Lasse Hallstrom or was this his masterpiece?? It also makes you want to try out the real chocolat as Vianne makes it in the movie, you want to experience the joy and satisfaction of the actors as the show",Chocolat
412,franger,Cute but deep romantic film,9,6 January 2006,"Ever since The English patient hit the screens, the charmingly Juliette Binoche is to be enjoyed thoroughly in whatever film she appears in, but in Chocolat, where she roams around as a nomadic one child-mother in her home country France, she gets more out of here performance than just cuteness.Of course, the purpose of the film is a romantic one, with Johnny Depp easily fulfilling his character as a notable gypsy and romantic interest of Binoche, and Alfred Molina as the classic malefactor in this story of the powers of chocolate. But the well casted Binoche steals the show with her French savoir-faire on the subtleties of yearning and seduction.Not seduction in a Sharon Stone way, A Kim Basinger or even a Jennifer Lopez way, but one that makes her a true believable girl next door, while still keeping that enigmatic secret, that every nomad seems to have.While we must not forget the nice performance of the supporting actors (of which Alfred Molina and Judi Dench stand out), it is Binoche that shows how to incorporate a romantic story with a deeper layer, without getting corny or boring, although we all know where it's gonna end.And that's where romantic films need to score: on a niche in the thematic material, or the characters of the romance, who want to be followed through their hurdles-taking.Chocolat succeeds handsomely with this, which makes it recommended not only for enamored couples of any age, but of everyone who wants a taste of what gives people their energy in struggling for a place of their own.",Chocolat
413,carolinamawe,A great movie,10,5 January 2006,"I just saw the movie this afternoon and I loved it. I found every detail perfect, the only problem I find with the movie is the huge necessity of eaten chocolate while you see it, so when watching it don't forget to have a bar near you! The movie talks about a series of interesting aspects of the life of a woman and her production of chocolate. I, being from Mexico, likes the part when she tells her daughter the story and we can see a Mayan celebration, I liked that they made us all remember that chocolate is originally from Mexico. I highly recommend this movie to anyone, and if you don't like love stories you can focus on the great photography of the movie.",Chocolat
