0,kosmasp,Feelings,7,4 May 2021,"This was not the first nor the last movie that used hardcore sex as a mainstream movie. Could it have worked without us seeing all the nudity and the explicit sex? I think yes, but it does make a point in how disconnected sex and feelings can be. Hence the title we get. This is a drama, so it is not totally there to be a viewing pleasure (no pun intended) or just plain arouse the viewer.We get relationships and issues within - how sex is a substitute ... but also something we seek! Sometimes knowing it won't actually bring us more than a quick satisfaction - quite literally. How can it be sustained? The acting is really good and you probably will care for them, which of course is a good thing. I never came around watching this until now - I thought the sex was just there to shock us into watching it, but there is more here than that.",Intimacy
1,rmax304823,Speechless Love.,6,19 February 2006,"A worthy movie for adults. The plot is a bit like ""Last Tango in Paris,"" with a man and woman accidentally meeting, then showing up one afternoon a week for some rabid sex, neither telling the other anything about themselves. The guy (Mark Rylance) decides to follow the woman (Kerry Fox), discovers she's married and works in a shabby theater, and is married to a not-overly-bright man who has too many chins and a puffy lower lip like Alfred Hitchcock's. Both of the men want her and she decides to stay with her husband and children. End of plot.This is about as deglamorized a movie as has recently appeared. At first, both Rylance and Fox look like the kind of people who are right up there in the first rank of the third rate. He runs a bar. He's balding, skinny, always needs a shave, and lives alone in some seedy dump that looks like a Soviet-era zheloy dom. She first appears with her hair up, working-class style, glumly groomed. And the two of them are photographed -- dressed or otherwise -- in a way that makes their skin seem to emit a pale sickly blue. Your first thought is liable to be a red flag: This is going to be one depressing flick.Then as the plot develops -- hard as it is to follow in its details -- we come to know them surprisingly well, the two of them. Rylance takes on a certain pathetic charm with his scarred eyebrow and occasional stutter. And Kerry Fox lets her hair down, literally, and we can see the self-knowledge and the desire in her big blue New Zealand eyes. They become likable.In many ways the most admirable person important to the story is Timothy Spall as Kerry's husband, the Hitchcockian cab driver. He's not particularly bright and he trusts people a bit too much. And, man, he looks unprepossessing. But he's gregarious, generous, good-natured, and as harmless as a child. When he discovers that Rylance and Fox have been boffing each other, what does he do? Does he pick up a gun and spray lead. Does he do a plastic-surgery number on Rylance's face? Nope. He goes round to Rylance's bar, has a beer, and tells Rylance that he loves his wife. And that every day he loves her more. Later, when Fox prompts him to ventilate his anger over her affair, all he can come up with is something like, ""I don't care about that s***! What really bothers me is that you're a lousy actress and will never be anything else!"" When he's done shouting, she replies, ""You don't even know how to hurt me."" There are other characters in the story too -- children, an ex-wife, somebody named Victor with a Scots accent, and a gay French bartender who philosophizes a lot. (I wonder if the writers had a particular model in mind.) Next to Kerry's husband, the French guy is about the most articulate of the bunch.But that's the problem with the movie. I was frankly lost at times. I honestly don't know how Spall's character found out about his wife's affair. Evidently she confirmed suspicions he already had, but since the scene doesn't appear on screen we have to guess. In fact, if the love scenes are speechless, the rest of the script isn't much better. More than once a character says to another, ""I can't understand a word you're saying."" Sometimes I couldn't either. ""We shouldn't be gay because someone died."" ""Nobody died."" ""I died once. It was the only day I could tell the whole truth."" I think we're in ""Last Year at Marienbad"" territory here. A shouting match between Rylance and Kerry in the basement theater made no sense to me at all. It reminded me of my marriage.I recommend it though. It's a rare movie made for adults. It's a challenging drama about lives that are either half empty or half full, depending on how you look at them. The ending is sad, but we are at least left with the hope that these characters can mend their tattered lives and get on with things.",Intimacy
2,Theo Robertson,Plot ? What Plot ?,2,8 June 2003,"What`s the point this film is trying to make ? I don`t get it , a woman comes round to a man`s house , they have sex and boy are they having sex , man follows the woman around and that`s basically it . Is there a plot involved ? No . Are the characters sympathetic ? No . Would you want to watch this with your family ? No . Would you want to watch this on your own ? I know some people would but they`d only be watching for the sex scenes know what I mean ? INTIMACY is really an art house porn film that has no redeeming features for anyone who watches films for entertainment purposes and is especially frustrating for budding screenwriters who find their scripts turned down because "" The plot is underdeveloped "" . At least the scripts I`ve written had a plot",Intimacy
3,grantss,So-so,5,29 December 2019,"So-so. Starts well enough. Had a fair amount of intrigue, but just when you think the movie is going to kick up a notch, it goes in a dull, pointless direction. From then on it drifts and ultimately goes nowhere.Good performance by Kerry Fox. Mark Rylance is irritating, however.",Intimacy
4,DICK STEEL,A Nutshell Review: Intimacy,5,11 January 2005,"Picture your life this way if you can: You are a regular bloke. You work as a bartender in a pub. Your wife has left you and has custody over your two kids. Your friends are a gay and a totally whacked out stoner.The only thing you look forward to, is the afternoon of Wednesdays. That's when an annonymous female stranger knocks on your door, enters your home and the both of you have sex.Just sex. Nothing else. You don't even talk to each other. Just plain humping. And she leaves after that, leaving you basking in orgasmic pleasure.And that, covers about 1/3 of the movie. Not just one sex scene, but plenty in between. Nothing fancy, just straight to the point humping.Things start to get complicated when you try to find out more about the life of this stranger, and the viewer is presented the background, motives and rationale behind the two lead characters.That's it. With one final hump, the movie ends. I suppose it's for the arty-farty folks, but heck, i think 90% of the audience in the sold-out theatre didn't comprehend what the movie is trying to put across.",Intimacy
5,christopher-underwood,Brave perceptive film making,9,10 January 2007,"Far, far better than I had expected from the little I had heard (not having read the numerous IMDb reviews until just now). Harsh, explicit and uncompromising, this film hardly welcomes with open arms. In fact nobody in the London as depicted seems to even dare to open their arms, except the two main protagonists, and they dare not open their hearts. It is in many ways a desperate and cynical film but unfortunately the squalor and general air of intolerance is only too familiar. There are, however, glimpses of the humanity beneath the surface that enables a city like London, the people of a crowded, selfish city like London to relate, however briefly, however seemingly meaninglessly, to each other. We do not live in times where there is too much time (or opportunity) we must grab our pleasures, indeed our needs when we can. Desperate, yes but uncaring, no and indeed a most ambitious attempt to illustrate the true nature of many relationships and the struggle for freedom and gratification when everyone is cheek by jowl and in direct competition. Brave perceptive film making.",Intimacy
6,=G=,The absence of love,7,23 January 2004,"""Intimacy"" tells of a divorced man and a married woman who have weekly loveless sex while each knows little of the other. The film explores the ""why"" of their peculiar relationship and follows the pair of protags to their inevitable conclusion. Whatever you know, think, or read about this film, it does break new ground as it pushes  legitimate cinema one small measure toward its destiny by  illuminating that dark corner of human behavior currently occupied only by pornography. Be prepared for graphic sex/nudity and some intensely personal scenes in a stark, austere, somewhat depressing but very courageous drama. Not for prudes, ""Intimacy"" will be most enjoyed by mature drama enthusiasts. (B)",Intimacy
7,MovieAddict2016,"Tries to be artsy, erotic, controversial and deep all at the same time - half-baked on every level.",5,21 August 2005,"I expected much more from ""Intimacy."" I remember when it first came out in 2001 and got a lot of bad reviews from the critics, but at first I thought it was probably just because they couldn't handle the (allegedly) ""explicit"" content matter. I was wrong: it really is a mediocre movie.The main problem is that we just don't care about the characters at all, I suppose. This could be compensated for by a strong director or interesting script, but it has neither. It's an independent film and the standards of film-making are simply just OK.Not all great low-budget films have likable characters but when you have one so ugly, it helps to make up for it by at least having characters we can relate to. (Good example: ""The Panic in Needle Park."" You feel like yelling at the characters, but you care for them because you can relate to their daily struggles -- lack of food, employment, money, etc. -- anyone who's been down on luck before can understand.) But ""Intimacy"" isn't the same. It's about a family guy who dumps his wife and kids and becomes a bartender at a London pub. He meets an anonymous woman for sex every week in a dirty apartment in a bad area.The movie doesn't work as an art-house experiment because it's neither artsy nor experimental. It pretends to be by showcasing those famous ""lingering"" shots that's become really tiring since every indie filmmaker decided it was a sign of talent and originality. It's not experimental because it follows the guidelines in terms of direction, cinematography and acting. It's not erotic because the sex scenes are dull and Kerry Fox is, to be totally honest, an ugly woman. (Which is the point - it makes the story more realistic - but all the same it also makes it un-erotic.) I think women would probably say the same about the male lead - and I hate to be the first person to point it out, but in regards to the infamous ""real"" sex scenes in the film... he's about as ""big"" as a blade of grass, and Kerry Fox is about as stimulating to watch as bumer-to-bumper traffic.It's not deep because it's so basic - we get to see the lack of morality in the leading characters. Well whoop-dee-do, so what? You're likely to find much better films out there than this. In terms of independent cinema it's a big let-down because it seems like any major Hollywood film hiding underneath the mold of something it isn't. The story isn't anything special and has been done before, the acting is just so-so, the ""erotic imagery"" isn't erotic, the level of entertainment is about zilch.All in all it comes across as a cheap imitator of ""Last Tango in Paris,"" which is about a hundred times better and a much more prominent example of having unlikable characters in a movie that we can still feel a connection for.",Intimacy
8,cherold,depressing but intriguing,7,16 April 2005,"Intimacy's title is an ironic joke; this is a movie about the lack of intimacy. Intimacy is supplied entirely through sex by characters who are unable to deal with it in their regular lives. Intelligent and absorbing, Intimacy is also quite depressing. Not sad, not tragic, just dispiriting. Jay is a bitter man who is doing his best to hold the world at arms length, yet his desire for something more than his superficial existence is what propels the actions of the movie. He is unable to connect with other people, but then, that seems to be true of almost everyone in the film, and the movie reeks of desperation.That doesn't sound like any fun at all, and Intimacy is not a good time movie. And it's not a weepy tragedy either, it's a cold, clinical film about existential loneliness. It is hard going but worth it.",Intimacy
9,dromasca,Well Acted Drama,8,28 June 2003,"'Intimacy' is a very well acted drama, set in London. Jay has left his wife and son a year ago, and lives a disordered life, working as a barman, and carrying some ambiguous relationships with a couple of friends. He meets weekly a woman, Claire, with which he has a pure sexual affair, without any communication, a la 'Last Tango in Paris'. Things start to go wrong in this affair, when apparently involved he follows and finds out the background of the woman, and befriends her husband and young son. The film is not easy, and sometimes the border between complexity and confusion is crossed. However, the acting is so good that the characters are just alive. Life is confusing as well many times, after all.
The film has many explicit sex scenes, and they have their place in the story line. This film is to a big extend about communication, and sex is the main way of communication between Jay and Claire for much of the film. Will this be enough to sustain their relationship? Well, go and see the movie and you will find out. 8/10 on my personal scale.",Intimacy
10,Red-125,Intimacy (the unrated version),6,1 January 2017,"Intimacy (2001) was co-written and directed by Patrice Chéreau. The movie stars Mark Rylance as Jay, the head barman at a club. Somehow, he has met Claire, played by Kerry Fox. To Jay's surprise, Claire reappears every Wednesday at his apartment to have sex with him. (That's the only way to phrase it. They don't talk, and there's no foreplay. They just tear their clothes off and go at it.) There's plenty of nude scenes of both Fox and Rylance. However, it's not really erotic, because the apartment is so dirty and unkempt that all I could think of was ""it's disgusting.""Matters would have apparently continued along in this way, except that Jay wants to know more about Claire. He manages to track her down to a pub/theater, where she's starring in ""The Glass Menagerie."" This brings him into contact with Andy, Claire's husband, played brilliantly by Timothy Spall. The plot really begins at this point, and I will carefully avoid explaining what happens next. I won't avoid saying that the plot appeared contrived and, basically, ridiculous. I wasn't familiar with the work of Kerry Fox, but she's an excellent actor. Rylance and Spall are great actors. It's hard to understand just what went wrong with this film. Some reviewers have suggested that director could have made a better movie in France than in England. Maybe we in the English-speaking world think that this bizarre plots works better if the actors are smoking Gauloises and drinking wine, rather than smoking Mayfairs and drinking ale.If you really want to see this movie, you'll have to decide whether you want to see all the sex (unrated version) or just the suggestion of sex (R-rated version). The movie has no real outdoor scenes, so it will work as well on DVD (which is how we saw it) as it will on the large screen. This isn't a great movie for anyone. If you want porn, buy porn. If you want narrative drama, buy narrative drama. Intimacy promises both, and gives you neither.",Intimacy
11,Chris_Docker,Unnerving exploration of compartmentalised love affairs and the actor in all of us,8,30 July 2001,"For art house movie lovers, easily one of the best movies so far this year. Already winner of notable awards at the Berlin Film Festival, including Best Actress, it could be set to offer Kerry Fox an Oscar nomination. In the French Cinema Verite tradition, the story looks at the ultimate bleakness of a purely sexual relationship where the two participants meet only for sex and know hardly anything about each other. From an initial kitchen sink drama level it opens out into a more colourful world where we see the two main characters in the context of their individual worlds. The characters feelings have, by this time, developed for each other, but without any knowledge or understanding of their respective lives. A scene involving an acting class seems to comment not only on how we can compartmentalise our lives in this way but raises questions about acting, in art and in real life, and also on the boundaries of intimacy and censorship. Intimacy pushes the censors boundaries in this film, as have a number of recent French films - the graphic inclusion of genitalia and oral sex being the issues here for British cinema, which have been passed uncut. The movie is neither titillating or gratuitous, so cuts, it could be argued, would have been morally abhorrent. The transformations Kerry Fox undergoes are emotionally powerful - I still felt shaken by the time I got home from the cinema.",Intimacy
12,noralee,Frank Look at Male/Female Grown-Up Sexual Relationships,8,20 December 2005,"""Intimacy"" is a very contemporary take on the Brit classic ""Brief Encounter,"" told mostly forward chronologically but backwards (with some confusion as to what's a flashback) in how the characters are revealed and relate to each other from grunting physical sex, like Erica Jong's ""zipless f*cks,"" to surprising feelings.By a French director with the naturalistic improv feel of a Mike Leigh film (including a regular actor from that repertory, Timothy Spall), inspired by a notorious semi-autobiographical short story by the author of ""My Beautiful Laundrette,"" it certainly feels more French than British --and I wouldn't have minded some sub-titles for when the working class mates get together.This movie is very full frontal frank, to the point that it caused quite a brouhaha in the British press over a scene where the lead actress (Kerry Fox) performs a blow job on the lead actor (Mark Rylance). As it happens, her significant other, and father of her baby, is a writer with ""The Prospect"" who wrote up his reactions, prompting a film critic's response on reel vs. real love-making. I was surprised in advance that the American reviewers barely noticed the scene -- until I realized that the U.S. version, even unrated, is one minute shorter than the European version -- and I saw that it's absolutely obvious what minute is missing.Here, unlike the usual frisky sexual encounter movies about twenty-somethings, what makes this movie so powerful rather than voyeuristic is the mature theater actors playing experienced grown-ups with individual histories. The actress makes a point to go to interviews about the film accompanied by her nursing infant and babysitting mother and the images in the movie of trusting children are effective counterpoints to their parents' actions. Significantly, the emotional climax for the characters comes when they are both bundled up in coats. The point of the friends' roles are a bit unclear, especially the young, handsome gay confidante who mostly seems to be pitying breeders, but it's nice to see Marianne Faithful as rooted in reality. The soundtrack pounds out the electronica regrets of the central male character's former life as a musician, but his existential actions and self-realization are straight out of Bruce Springsteen's ""Hungry Heart.""(originally written 11/22/2001)",Intimacy
13,rosscinema,Intrigueing story falls short emotionally,5,21 February 2005,"With it's premise of anonymous sex and emotionally distant characters this in some ways resembles a cross between ""Last Tango in Paris"" and the recent ""Closer"" but the manner in which the material is handled fails to come even remotely close to those superior films. Story is about Jay (Mark Rylance) who's a divorced father of two boys and now is head bartender in a popular English pub. Every Wednesday afternoon he meets Claire (Kerry Fox) and the two of them have sex but do not discuss with each other who the other person is.*****SPOILER ALERT***** Claire stops coming by on Wednesdays and Jay starts to follow her around and discovers that she's an amateur actress working in a play in the back of a pub. Jay enters the establishment and views the play and actually meets Claire's husband Andy (Timothy Spall) and starts a friendship with him but after a few visits it becomes apparent to Andy what is going on between them.Patrice Chereau is an actor/director/writer and has worked a good deal in the theater and there are several scenes that take place with the actors that appear could have fit well in a stage production. The story takes an angry approach to it's characters as their portrayed as people who just cannot commit completely emotionally and while as interesting as that is it's hard to feel one way or another for those involved. In ""Closer"" we don't feel remorse but we do understand (and feel) their pain and anger but here the story tries so hard for the viewer to know how distant these people are that it ultimately becomes impossible to have one feeling or another. Spliced into this film are some pretty good performances and while Rylance shows he can carry a picture it's the always reliable Fox that is easier to identify with. Arguably the best performance comes from Spall (Secrets and Lies) who shows us a character that has good instincts but after all the years of marriage finds out that his wife is terribly unhappy. Chereau presents us with characters that had real potential but the script fails in terms of allowing the viewer to be interested in their struggles.",Intimacy
14,Maciste_Brother,A French director should never make a film about British people,1,16 April 2008,"One of the most unpleasant films I've ever seen.The dialogue is howlingly bad. All the characters are reprehensible. The script doesn't make any sense whatsoever.The only thing everyone talks about this film are the sex scenes because the rest is not worth mentioning. The story made so little sense. The relationships between the characters were unbelievable (the gay bartender, the drunk roommate, the main character befriending the overweight husband, etc). Everyone, and I mean everyone, was dour and angry.The bits of dialogue made me laugh out loud. Nothing rang true. Notice the hilarious dialogue during the scene between the two women in the park. I couldn't believe what I was hearing. Here's an example:""When I died, there was no one there. I had to go through the whole thing on my own.""""What was it, the day you died?""Who talks like that?To make things even worse, the acting is strictly amateurish.The film has a very French feel to it because the director is French but the whole thing didn't jibe at all. It was like watching British characters behave in a French manner, with everything set not in France but set in England.It's almost like the director wanted to make all English folks look bad. Really bad.Avoid at all cost.",Intimacy
15,rainking_es,Sex attraction vs. Love,7,9 June 2006,"A man and a woman, they barely know each other, they don't even know their names, and they're connected only for one reason: each Wednesday she visits him and they have an intense session of sex. That's it: 100% animal attraction... but he wants to know something else about her, and things will become complicated. At the same time we'll gradually discover some details about the lives of the main characters: their disappointing in love, their fears, their doubts... I'm sure that most of the people that watched ""Intimacy"" pointed out the fact that the scenes with sexual content are quite explicit (pornographic, to put it plainly). Now,I'm not gonna discuss about if that kind of scenes are necessary or not, that's up to the director (and to the actors), but the fact is that in this case they emphasize the powerful sexual attraction between both characters. This is a good modern drama, with some secondary characters that look rather unnecessary. Two thumbs up for the work of the the two leading actors (you won't see Angelina Jolie or Sandra Bullock doing that kind of jobs)... and we also have the great Timothy Spall (but don't worry, you won't have to see him naked).*My rate: 7/10",Intimacy
16,Imdbidia,Raw movie about mid life disenchantment,8,8 February 2011,"Intimacy is a European co-production directed by French director Patrice Chereau in his first English speaking feature, also set in the UK. The script is based on two pieces by writer Hanif Kureishi: the book ""Intimacy"", and the short story ""Nightime"".Intimacy tells the story of Andy, a divorcée bartender who meets Claire at his apartment on Wednesday to have sex, no words involved... until they start to click emotionally and Andy starts following her to know more about her.Intimacy is a soaring and raw movie about mid life disenchantment, and the need of physical contact to built emotional one.The film has been controversial due to the presence of explicit sexual scenes. However, reducing such a good film and story, to just the sex scenes is intentionally misleading, moralistic, and completely unfair to a story that presents many of the problems of middle-agers in a honest and raw way: abandonment, divorce, loneliness, the feeling of being lost and emotional empty, the sense of not going anywhere in life, the trouble to fulfill your responsibilities as an adult despite being all messed up in your head and soul, fracas and rejection, unhappiness and hope. All of this is beautifully blended and portrayed in the film.The sex scenes are very strong, very demanding both physically and emotionally, simulated most of them, but very convincing as they really and feel very real. The viewer gets the impression that is watching a real couple having sex. The sex is always raw, and goes from almost brutal to sweet, from hungry to delightful, from anxious to comforting, with all the body language and emotions associated to different emotional states. Being so, the viewer does not feel aroused by the images, but sad and anxious about the couple being so needy of contact, and so unable to contact. The sex, in that sense, is a proof of the soul and feelings of the characters, not a dirty thing. In that regards, the film creates a clear line between what sex is not, and sets a clear boundary with porn, despite the fellatio in the film being non simulated, which is portrayed as a sweet moment of sharing and not a as woman mechanically sucking a man off for his own pleasure and as a sexual slave.The mood of the movie is great, with a mix of night and interior greenish/yellowish depressing scenes and warm and luminous ones. The art direction is great, as well as the music.The performances by all actors are terrific, convincing, powerful, and masterful, especially the leading couple Mark Rylance as Jay and Kerry Fox as Claire, in two roles that are extremely demanding both at a physical and emotional level. The supporting actors are also good and convincing: Alastair Galbraith as Claire's husband Victor, Philippe Calvario as the gay bartender Ian, Timothy Spall as Jay's drug addict brother Andy, and Marianne Faithful as Claire's friend Betty, among others. Although Galbraith is always terrific, I don't think he was the right person, physically, for his character, as it is difficult to believe that Claire would be with this sort of guy, to be honest.A very sad movie, not easy to watch, with confronting images and themes, moving at times, with a very powerful story, wonderfully performed and directed. Abstain from viewing if you are a puritan, as you will only see the sex.",Intimacy
17,ruby_fff,Reflections on the myth of intimacy - poignant look at married relationships in repair,8,20 January 2002,"Perhaps if they only have stayed as 'strangers' - not knowing more than what they had: merely just this meeting on Wednesdays for the brief exchange of sexually charged energy being spent. They are two lonely people coming together for the hour to forget the rest of the world and just have a good f---. Is it good? It doesn't matter. It's letting out energy, of any unwanting karma, somehow to get lost or let go during the 'intimate' exchange. Is it intimate? Not really. The physical act can be termed as intimate, but are they? They don't really care. She appears at the door. He goes down the stairs and opens the door. She comes up the stairs. They're in the room. Hardly any exchange in words. They get to it. They lost in it. They're spent. Yes. It's NFE: mature audiences for sure. There are repeated scenes when they are explicitly bare, and the camera holds no restraint in showing us what and how they're doing it, baring down on the body contours, the handwork, the mouthwork, and the sighs, grunts, releases of energy we candidly see and hear. According to Wilhelm Reich, ""The Function of the Orgasm"" they have accomplished. (Dusan Makavejev's 1971 ""W.R.: Mysteries of the Organism""). So one might think the film ""Intimacy"" is more on the 'pornographic' vein. Not at all. There were no money or transaction exchanged. It's two consenting adults, willing and able, and no questions asked. It's really not 'intimate' at that level. One might say it's like French director Frédéric Fonteyne's ""An Affair of Love"" 1999 (""Une liaison pornographique"" with Nathalie Baye and Sergi López), but here we are fed more details about the two principals' background and family. One can be physically at ease and intimate when you're both detached. When you know nothing more than meets the eye - you can fantasize however you want the other to be, no personal cares or expectations, most of all, judgment, selfishness or jealousy do not come into play. Stay comfortable strangers and let not truth or trust get in the way. Is not knowing bliss?The feeling of possession - one's jealousy quotient - how Jay (Mark Rylance's character) is unable to accept the surprised fact that SHE has a happy family to return to with husband and son who love her, while he has nothing of the sort. He's miserably divorced for the past six years, still struggling with memories of his two sons and wife. His so-called friend Victor doesn't help - he actually leans on Jay more than Jay needs to.Jay is muddled all right. He reacts in a 'vindictive' heartless, unkind way. Having chatted and met her husband and son, he desperately feels more in need of HER love exchange. He wants to grab onto what little he has as he's feeling he'll lose her. Envious, Jay is. Pathetic, too.
Kerry Fox is equally in depth in her performance as Rylance. She doesn't have many dialogs at first. Her character also has a friend, which Marianne Faithfull portrays. Timothy Spall is the husband sensitively delivered. (Reminds me of PBS series ""Reckless"" 1997-98 - Michael Kitchen's portrayal of the unbearable, jealous husband was hard to erase.)
Is not life/love give and take, readjusting one's expectation levels as time goes by or as needs arise? ""Lantana"" 2001, the popular Australian mystery drama offers different aspects and insights of four married couples - murder or no murder.",Intimacy
18,shark-43,A Jumbled Mess,5,8 November 2001,"Maybe I had read too many good reviews and maybe I'm too much of a Mark Rylance, Kerry Fox and Tim Spall fan, but I was let down by the film. Yes, it has powerful scenes, yes, the sex is very graphic and it was quite gutsy of the two lead actors to film those scenes, but the ""screenplay"" seems more interested in not piecing anything together than trying to tell the story. I definbitely do not need things spelled out for in a movie, in fact, I do love films that challenge you, make you work, but this one seemed to throw some explanations and character's backstory at you at the end and it certainly did not add up to much of anything. Fox, Rylance and Spall all have their moments and the film certainly lifts up the dark little edges on such things like fidelity and commitment, but overall I found it a jumbled mess where the pace ended up killing any power the film thought it might have. (To this day, Spall's work In ""Secrets & Lies"" still stays with me)",Intimacy
19,bix171,Indirect Yet Compelling,7,25 March 2004,"Like most films either adapted from Hanif Kureishi's fiction or having screenplays written by him (`My Beautiful Laundrette', `Sammy And Rosie Get Laid' as well as this film, which lists Kureishi as a co-writer along with Anne-Louise Trividic and director Patrice Chereau), `Intimacy' circles its subject in an indirect manner, never declaring what it's truly about but leaving a distinct impression. This can make for difficult viewing, requiring an inordinate amount of concentration to keep up (and which wears you down after a while) and it only sinks in long after it's over. But that's the film's strong point: the writers prefer to have you draw your own conclusions, with dialogue that forces you to read between the lines of an affair in which both participants seem to be using it to address their individual demons. Chereau and Kureishi are more interested in their characters' circumstances than their actions but it's precisely their circumstances that make their actions compelling. Mark Rylance and Kerry Fox are the lovers (and they're excellent, even though the fact their trysts are presented in explicit detail may overshadow their performances), with Rylance as a bitter bartender who has spontaneously abandoned his family and Fox as a drama teacher stifled in her marriage to a cabbie (Mike Leigh favorite Timothy Spall, also very fine) whom Rylance befriends in an attempt to understand her; it's the tensions that build around the trio that drives the narrative. It's an unhappy yet sensitive film that may distance some audiences and push others into uncomfortable areas they may not want to visit, yet there's no denying its inquisitive, intelligent presence.",Intimacy

Not because of non-realism; the film is stark in its uncompromising portrayal of not-so-beautiful, not-so-nice characters, which elevates it somewhat.The plot, more than the central characters, wavers. It's like being on a boat, not knowing where the tide is taking you. Thankfully this film is better and more realistic than Titantic.

24,SamRag,Some will be shocked,6,15 August 2002,"Here is a film which will evoke strong feelings from anyone watching.  I'm sure many will be shocked or even angry when they view this film, but one thing is for sure that you will be emotionally moved in one way or another. Sadly, I can't say it makes this film therefore good.  Intimacy is about Jay and his strange Wednesday relationship with Claire.  He is having problem in evaluating or understanding the relationship, especially due to the fact that Claire does not request anything from him other then sex.   The story takes place in London, and in some ways reminded me of the film Naked, which happens also in London and is about people without direction and poor life standards.  But Intimacy is nowhere as good as Naked was.  The film is trying to be confusing in an artistic way, desperately not giving away too much of the story line, keeping the film full of holes.  And even though this sometimes works, I feel that here it just makes you spent too much time wondering what on earth is going on. Many will concentrate on the very explicit sex scenes in the film, which at times was on the verge of being pornographic.  The strange thing though is that this was the best part of the film, and was defiantly required to give you an appreciation of the dilemma Jay finds himself in.  All together I was glad that I saw this film, but sad in regards of how little it left behind. 6/10",Intimacy
25,bjacob,One of the films who made me,10,13 May 2021,"I credit this film for making me realise I wanted to live in London; which is sort of odd, as the alienation and loneliness depicted in Intimacy are very real dangers of the life in The Big Smoke. In this respect, as in all others, this film doesn't lie. Yet, in a way that I can't quite put into words, this film showed me this city is a new light, it explained why I was supposed to love it.Much has been said of the sex scenes. Yes, they are the pivotal feature of the plot; I remember someone went through it with a chronometer and found them totaling some nineteen minutes. However, there is so much more to Intimacy: the wonderful acting of both protagonists and secondary characters, the delicate nuançes of situation and dialogue, and indeed London which has never been so beautiful on a screen.Intimacy is a very London story seen through the eyes and mindset of a Frenchman: you won't find any of the urban shibboleths you might be used to. Coincidentally, since a few years I live round the corner from the pub which was used for the exteriors of the theatre scene. It's no longer painted in blue, and it's no longer a pub (it's, predictably, luxury flats): the London depicted in Intimacy is mostly gone. Yet its idea of the city, and its preoccupation with the very real struggle -- and for some, impossibility -- of getting closer to another human being, warts and all, are very much extant.",Intimacy

They were too explicit, too visual, especial one particular part. It was unnecessary to show that much skin and certain oral acts. There are classier ways to show a love scene. This however felt like borderline porn.Well besides the major flaw mentioned above, this film could have been great. If done in the vein of ""Match Point"", it could have been a real gem. Terrific story, but clouded by a shoddy script and uninteresting characters. The flashbacks the gentlemen was having were sort of moving, and he did some fine acting.

But there is absolutely nothing erotic or unusual about them; they chiefly resemble farm animals mating in a mucky stable. Their coldness is deliberate, and an intrinsic part of this story about emotional chasms. Intimacy is what is missing from the character's lives. The overall milieu, which might be characterised as 'tatty-London' helps this a lot; the whole film is quite depressing in that sense. The least successful part of the film is the depiction of the relationship between Claire and her drama class student, which becomes tedious. The film is immeasurably helped by Timothy Spall's lugubrious taxi driver husband, at once knowing but also in denial.",Intimacy

Still, even if the numbing grey-greenness of the images is intended, the dinginess goes past aesthetic overstatement-- cannot imagine Chereau intended to induce headaches, though that is the effect.  Timothy Spall playing a cuckold is akin to Dennis Hopper as a psycho-- a good actor in a role he should not have taken.

Do we understand why everything is so dirty and so old and the weather is always so miserable? I like movies that make me work at understanding them, I like to be challenged by characters who are unlikable.

32,joaodelauraaurora,Sex as catharsis,8,5 January 2002,"Despite all the controversy about its explicit sex scenes, `Intimacy' is a movie about loneliness, about the precarious encounter of shattered lives. Jay and Claire meet every Wednesday and have sex without exchanging a single word. She is married; he is a divorcé. They need those anonymous meetings not as a source of physical pleasure, but as an expression of distress and frustration. That's why the sex scenes are the more powerful the less erotic they are: for Jay and Claire, it's about catharsis, not about flesh. We could expect them to cry after making love; never to smile. Director Chéreau does an impressive job to convey solitude and desperation out of Hanif Kureishi's stories: a sordid set, a gloomy atmosphere, an intimate camera. But the movie's strength comes mostly from the extraordinary acting by Rylance and Fox, subtle in their sadness, brilliant with or without clothes. Confronted with their angst and their secret ritual, all other characters, all other subplots are in a way superfluous. A great movie (8/10).",Intimacy
33,Miguel Fialho,Sex is the logical intimate answer.,8,16 July 2001,"Let's start with a few questions!How do we get really intimate with someone? With your mind or with your body? And at which point are we willing to share our intimacy? Let's just try this particular point of view (one of many) in this movie. The one that struck me the most. People who talk and try to help someone with their personal experience may give a little enlightenment but never touch one's unique mind nor will fully understand the equation of it. Sometimes, it's better not to speak at all. Just like Claire (Kerry Fox's character) shouts to her husband after their quarreling: ""You don't even know how to hurt me!""Sex is the logical answer in this picture. It's the only thing that's left to get intimate with someone and doing so, openly, we don't pretend who we are. ""Show me how you do it and I'll tell you who you are!"" Unfortunately, some things should never be told or wanted to discover. No words should be spoken. Here, intimacy is to acknowledge only with body and never with the mind. It has nothing to do with pleasure. It's sharing to the very core of physical acquaintance. And doing sex like this it's the ultimate essence regarded only to whom can't ""play"" anymore their ordinary lives. ""Share with me the way you do it and I don't need to know how you live"".",Intimacy

It was shot in London, based on a British book and novel (from Hanif Kureishi) by a french - also theater - director with a.o. a Shakespearian actor, Mark Rylance, an actress from New Zealand - Kerry Fox - and Marianne Faithfull.This movie is much spoken of because of its sex scenes : there are indeed magnificient in their simplicity. This is about a man and a woman who go through a crisis and find themselves back through a liaison first lived in silence.This is about the relationship between body and soul : the body leads to the soul but is also an obstacle to spirituality at the same time. Where is the frontier laid down between sex and falling in love truly ? All those to be for ever unanswered questions are here illustrated through moments of pure emotions, among the most beautiful I ever lived in a movie theater. The performance of Mark Rylance, who let himself go in the hands of a director he did not even know before shooting is in itself enough of a reason to go see this movie. Awesome...",Intimacy
36,chichi-3,A clarification about Christian Koefoed's comment,10,4 May 2001,"I just wanted to react for I think Mr Koefoed is mistaken as to who actually did the movie. He said that Kureishi shot the movie and had to go to France in order to have the sex scenes being inserted into the film. In fact, Kureishi actually never thought that this particular book of his would one day be brought on the big screen. All of it is Patrice Chereau's idea (a famous director in France and if you care one day to see some of his other movies like ""L'homme blessé"" or ""La reine Margot"" or else ""Ceux qui m'aiment prendront le train"", you'll realize that Chereau's fascination for a naturalist representation of bodies and sex was there well before ""Intimacy""). Chereau entirely shot the film HIMSELF (and not Kureishi). Actually Chereau first read a french translation of Kureishi's novel (he did not speak english then : he learned it because he absolutely wanted to shoot the film in London, thinking - and he was right - that Paris was totally inappropriate to render the harshness of the characters'environment) and then he called Kureishi on the phone to tell him that he wanted to make a movie partly based on his book. The writing of the scenario was in fact led by three people : Kureishi (who brought to Chereau one of his short stories from which the sex scenes are actually derived), Chereau and Anne-Louise Trividic. Chereau and Kureishi have both said (lots has been written in the french press about the movie) that the WRITING of the screenplay (Chereau based half of his career on directing theater plays, he is very famous for that too : made huge things for the Avignon theatre festival) was very much of a ""by six hands played"" piece of music. Meeting constantly for the 4-5 years that the Intimacy enterprise lasted, Kureishi and Chereau became friends but Kureishi saw nothing of the movie until it was practically finished (you can find an interview from him on the Le Monde web site). He said that the film was a perfect depiction of London and of its harshness (that, by the way, does not appear that much in the book ""Intimacy"" for there the social background of the characters was much healthier) and that he was at the same time totally in awe and appalled by the final result, which in his view demonstrated that the film was really the product of a total cooperation between him and Chereau. In short, as said Chereau himself, Intimacy is really a child of what is called ""European cinema"", where an English man transmitted his view of London to a French man and where a French man succeeded to tell a story of passion in a language that was totally foreign to him before.",Intimacy

If you remember seeing an old David Lean movie called ""Brief Encounter"", ""Intimacy"" may remind you of it only this film takes you much farther into the actual affair than many films dare to go. Whoever trains British actors gets my undying admiration. Mark Rylance gives an understated performance that simply thrills a person with its reality. Anyone who knows the work of Mike Leigh (Secrets and Lies) will want to see this movie. All of the actors give performances that rate highly with me. Imagine a scene where actors have to pretend that they are in an actors training session and they are supposedly doing improvisation. How would you script this? Could you script this? It's marvelous to watch.As the plot advances the dialogue is spare. A sign of great film making in my view. The camera work and editing provide the clues as to what is transpiring. At the heart of the movie, the tables turn in an unexpected way that leaves the viewer breathless. You almost have to stop watching to consider all of the implications of what has happened.Sure there are some strange inexplicable events, but that's life isn't it? So based on boldness, superb acting, amazing realization or direction this film will shock and satisfy, puzzle and pique your interest. One of the greats to emerge from the new realist school of European film making. Along with Romance and Blais Moi. Finally film making that looks at sexuality in an adult way and doesn't get coy when the actual act of sex is depicted.

The movie takes you to the land of unwelcome emotions and how they can ruin a relationship between two people, it happens everyday between friends, couples, lovers. Truth is sex can hurt without you realising. This movie is great at showing that, as you watch the intensely realistic sex scenes and then you see him alone waiting for her, you can feel his pain. I really liked the soundtrack it was upbeat and light. There are some drawbacks such as the actor playing husband is basically unrealistically ugly and dumb for the woman. It's got some really great scenes and definitely worth watching and it ends as it should end in real life. Very good.",Intimacy

I had problems to understand most of the actions and reactions of the characters in the movie so I couldn't identify with anybody or any of their problems. Perhaps I'm not flexible enough ... or I'm just too happy with my life! If somebody has similar problems with the movie I can recommend 'Une liaison pornographique' by Frédéric Fonteyne - it has a related topic and is far more comprehensible.6/10",Intimacy

They don't have any understanding of what marriage is. Another name for marriage is surrender and acceptance and patience. The three corner stones of relationship. okay the protagonist the lady goes around satisfying her physical sexual urge with this unknown guy to which a lot of feminist will say sexual freedom and what not. They will also blame the husband that he did not pay any attention to her needs both emotional and biological. I ask you is it entirely his fault.

You will feel that you had shared the cold room with them that you had walked the streets of London like Jay, trying to work it all out, trying to make sense of the lust and the loss, trying to identify your feelings  to put names to emotions.
Thankfully I live in a country where we are not constrained by prudishness; to have cut a single shot from the sex scenes would have been an insult to the audience, to the film and to the art of cinema. Nothing was prurient, you shared the intimacy and the range of emotions that went with it.I wouldn't say that the acting was faultless (except for Timothy Spall) but the characters were so real it was easy to forget that they were acting anyway.

Still, I have no idea how a sexually repressed country like Britain will pass this film without cuts.  It will be intriguing to see the infantile controversy that this film will ignite in the media when it plays here.I wouldn't recommend this film for those who are used to fast-paced stories and quick-fire dialogue.

45,varunv-57277,An interesting albeit flawed erotic drama,6,10 October 2021,"An interesting albeit flawed erotic drama that feels like a cross between Last Tango in Paris & Brief Encounter, but with none of the intensity of the former & none of the emotional resonance of the latter. The title is misleading as this film is more about a hollow & completely unemotional no strings attached sexual relationship between two lonely individuals. This then ultimately leads to one of the parties trying to seek something more than just quick sweaty sex & forge a more emotional connection with the other person. This as expected leads to further complications, the ramifications of which would go on to impact both their lives.The film is quite drab in terms of it's settings playing out completely in shoddy looking flats, dull underground theaters & unappealing bars which is quite intentional given that the film is trying to be an anti romance. The characters look tired & drained out & even the sex is as unerotic as possible. The first hour sets the stage for intriguing things to come & I was curious to see where the film would head once our lead decides to get to know more about his fuck buddy. But the film takes a detour into somewhat bland & predictable territory once that happens. Still it is quite commendable that the sex is portrayed as realistically & authentically as possible. This is not titillation or provocative art porn but an honest look at depersonalized sex that does not seek to arouse.Mark Rylance seems a bit miscast here in my opinion. He is a terrific actor but he seems somewhat too posh sounding for what is essentially a working class character. Someone like a Gary Oldman or a David Thewlis would have been perfect for this role instead. Kerry Fox fares better especially in the theater scenes, though her accent does slip into her NZ twang at times. Timothy Spall (Peter Pettigrew from the HP movies) is pretty much the highlight here as the cheated husband. His character pretty much plays to his strengths as an actor & he portrays it perfectly. The taxi scene in particular is a perfect demonstration of his skills.I just wish that this film had more to deliver than what it did. The supporting characters which include a French bartender & a Scottish bum are amusing but completely superfluous to the movie & rather underdeveloped. I did not understand their role or significance here. Neither are some of the events as rationally played out as one might expect. One revelation in particular is not even shown or conveyed to the audience until it is just mentioned in passing.To sum it up, this is a perfectly serviceable film but it does not break any new ground that had been mostly set by the 2 aforementioned movies it clearly seems to be influenced by.",Intimacy

Well, these supposedly controversial scenes were anything but erotic and have been put on film more effectively in the past (Ai No Corrida, Romance). By the third time the two lead characters got down to it I thought, why am I here?The first half of the film is essentially plotless and lacking in meaningful dialogue although I suppose we're expected to experience the main character's life as he lives it and, well, this is his life, lacking in substance and meaning, much like this film for the first hour. Some of the acting was ATROCIOUS, although mainly by the supporting cast (Marianne Faithful for goodness sake!). The casting director really should get his head examined.Although the direction was weak and despite the fact that I felt like walking out at one stage (and some people did), as with any not-great film there were positives. Timothy Spall is a very good actor and, although his character seems fairly one-dimensional initially, he injects a touch of class into some of the more powerful later scenes.Otherwise, a fairly poor 2* out of 5*",Intimacy

Four years later and seeing the film for the first time, I do think there is cause for alarm at the film but not for the reasons given by the original moral critics. The film is simply dreadful. For a tale so concerned with the appearances given by people, all three leads (Rylance, Fox and Spall) frequently give appalling performances. Then there is the general unevenness of the film. It sways uncontrollably from the quiet 'intimate' scenes, which are probably the best bits of the two hours, to the moments of dramatic confrontation that lack focus, sense or drama. The director simply cannot handle straightforward dramatic duologues. There is a character called Victor, and every time he turns up there is a huge question-mark hanging over the film saying - where is this going? Avoid this film. Last Tango in Paris was bad enough.

NC-17 movies I thought contained the most nudity next to adult rated X movies.

As I was watching the sex scenes I thought ""I SHOULD be finding this erotic"" but I wasn't -- probably because I didn't these like or care about them. (I guess that's the difference between ""women's porn"" and ""men's porn."") I thought the entire mood of the movie was dark, depressing and that the characters had sex just to reassure themselves they were alive. To me, that's sad and pathetic and depressing, not erotic. Hey, call me a romantic.To each his/her own, I guess.Watch it for the sex scenes if you like, but for me, there wasn't much else in terms of interesting plot lines or character. I think it's boring and frequently painful to watch.PS The movie is over. I asked my husband if HE liked it, since he watched it to the end. His answer was NO. He read this review, and he agrees. A waste of time.",Intimacy
