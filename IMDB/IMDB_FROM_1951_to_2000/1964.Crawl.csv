0,Leofwine_draca,Solid addition to the genre,7,17 October 2020,"CRAWL is yet another ""killer animal"" flick from no less a director than Alexandre Aja, who made one of my favourites in the genre, PIRANHA 3D. This one's a scaled-down story about a woman and her father trapped in the basement of a flooding house with a pack of alligators for company. In Aja's hands its a thrill-ride of a movie, shot in Serbia so as you can't tell, and with plenty of suspenseful moments along the way. The performances are solid, there's a lovable canine addition to the cast, and the CGI effects are used sparingly so more effective than in a regular SyFy flick. The first half is a little slower and stalls at times, but things build to an appropriately pulse-pounding climax.",Crawl
1,SnoopyStyle,stupid Florida people,5,29 November 2019,"In Florida, competitive swimmer Haley (Kaya Scodelario) returns home to search for her estranged father (Barry Pepper) in the path of a hurricane. She finds him in his basement trapped by alligators. This thriller is predicated on stupid Florida people doing stupid things. It's a horror where the people will always go down into the basement. If there is a basement within the basement, the people will go down there. The people will keep going down basements until they reach China. It needs to alleviate this by subtracting some of the danger. It's an unusual move for the genre but danger is not dangerous when the characters simply walk straight into it. When she searches for her father, the storm should be a further 24 hours away. They could be trapped for longer so that she wouldn't be so outrageously stupid. Also, the message should be a 911 text from her father rather than a whatever conversation with her sister. The deputy should not be so stupid as to be walking in the storm water to investigate a swing. As for thieves, those can be ridiculously stupid. Over and over again, the characters are doing stupid things and it would be more thrilling if they be less stupid. Otherwise, this would be a solid horror.",Crawl
2,nogodnomasters,Apex Predator,6,21 July 2019,"Haley (Kaya Scodelario) is an also-ran swimmer. He dad trained her to be an ""apex predator"" although she still comes up short. He claims her problem is mental. During a cat 5 hurricane, Haley returns home to Brightrock, Florida (filmed in Serbia) because her dad isn't answering his phone. (I wouldn't even do that for me.) As the wind and rain intensifies, Haley finds her father (Barry Pepper) injured in a crawl space under the house. He is on the other side of some pipes which prevent Godzilla, the alligator from reaching him. Haley works to save her dad, battling both the elements and a large Godzilla alligator which is soon joined by Cujo-gator because one man-eating gator isn't enough.Sometimes being the mammal on the top of the food chain is tough. I thought rescue helicopters were grounded during Cat 5 hurricanes. The film would have been better with a subplot to break up the constant gator hide and seek.Guide: F-word. No sex or nudity.",Crawl
3,kosmasp,Sneaky,8,3 October 2019,"It is easy to dismiss horror and even easier to do so with scares (jump or otherwise, but the former are the ones most ""target""). But to dimish what the movie accomplishes would be unfair to everyone involved. The director and editor really know their stuff. The movie has quite some really good scares! Even when you know something is coming, it really hits home. Or in this case the viewer who might have quite the reaction to it (that's what shocks are going to you and your jerking body).Having said all that, I do understand if some feel this is simple and not to mention way over the top. There's things happening that no human being would do and/or survive and Alligators are probably not as hungry as they are shown here. But suspend your disbelief and just enjoy the ride, with some fantastic horror performances! Not to mention amazing sets and suspense!",Crawl
4,jboothmillard,Crawl,6,1 September 2019,"From the trailer I saw, this looked a good standard large animal monster movie, I was always going to see it, and then my interest was boosted by positive reviews from critics, produced by Sam Raimi (Evil Dead, Don't Breathe), directed by Alexandre Aja (The Hills Have Eyes, Piranha, Horns). Basically, Haley Keller (The Maze Runner's Kaya Scodelario) is an aspiring swimmer attending the University of Florida. Her sister Beth (Morfydd Clark) calls to inform her that a Category 5 hurricane is on a collision course with Florida and advises her to get away. Haley is concerned for the safety of her father Dave (Barry Pepper), as he is not answering his phone. She is stopped by Florida State Police and told to turn around, but she ignores them and navigates around evacuation routes to check in on Dave. Haley first tries his condo, where he has been living since divorcing her mother. Haley finds the family dog Sugar there but not Dave himself and is worried that he has returned to the family home in Coral Lake, which he supposedly sold years ago. Haley and Sugar navigate the flooded streets and find Dave's truck at the Coral Lake house. There, she descends into the crawl space (basement) underneath the house, and eventually finds her father unconscious and wounded. When she tries to drag him out, her exit is cut off by large and ravenous alligators, escaped from the nearby alligator farm, they have entered through a storm drain open to the crawl space. The alligators are too large to fit around the pipes under the house, allowing Haley and Dave a place of safety. However, the hurricane intensifies, and the crawl space begins to flood, so Haley must navigate around the alligators before she and her father drown. While attempting to escape the crawl space, Haley drops her phone in the water, and discovers the secondary exit is blocked by a box on top of the hatch. She notices a group of looters in the gas station opposite the house, she tries to get their attention, but they are killed by the alligators. Two police officers arrive looking for Haley and other survivors of the storm, they are also killed by the alligators. Dave manages to kill an alligator by splitting its head open with a shovel but gets trapped. In a last effort to escape, Haley makes her way to the storm drain, where she discovers that the alligators have made their nest and laid eggs. Haley successfully kills an alligator using a gun retrieved from the body of one of the police officers, shooting down the alligator's throat when it nearly bites her hand off. She makes it upstairs, crow-barring the living room floor open, Dave drowns and goes unconscious, but she manages to save him. Free of the crawl space, Haley, Dave and Sugar get into the looters' boat just as the eye of the hurricane moves over the neighbourhood. However, the flood banks are broken, Coral Lake is flooded even more, and the rush of water sends them crashing back into the house and separates them. While Dave and Sugar make their way upstairs, Haley navigates around the kitchen and in the bathroom, and finds a discarded police radio and uses it to broadcast a distress signal. After retrieving a set of road flares and saving Sugar from being attacked, Dave loses an arm to one of the alligators. Haley attempts to get the attention of a rescue helicopter from upstairs, but is attacked by another alligator, which attempts to drown her in a death roll. While Dave and Sugar escape to the attic, Haley stabs the alligator in the eye with a flare and narrowly avoids being mauled by a fourth alligator swimming to the roof outside. After the alligator is swept away, Haley lights a flare and flags down the rescue helicopter as Dave and Sugar watch. Also starring Ross Anderson as Wayne Taylor, Jose Palma as Pete, George Somner as Marv, Anson Boon as Stan and Ami Metcalf as Lee. Scodelario as the petrified but determined swimmer and daughter, and Pepper as the injured and helpless father, together they make a good duo, any other characters that show up are essentially eaten by the monsters. It is a very simple premise, the house is going underwater and the characters must get out before they drown or alligators maul them, the survival element is compelling, and the suspense is maintained by well-timed and crafty tension, but there are the calmer moments to make you root for the characters, and ""See You Later, Alligator"" by Bill Haley and the Comets appears in the end credits for a gag, it's definitely a creature feature to sink your teeth into, a fun disaster horror. Good!",Crawl
5,Woodyanders,Watch out for the alligators,8,15 March 2020,"Plucky champion swimmer Haley (a fine and appealing portrayal by Kaya Scodelario) and her hard-nosed dad Dave (ably played with steely resolve by Barry Pepper) find themselves trapped in the basement of a house during a severe hurricane with a couple of vicious predatory alligators.Director Alexandre Aja keeps the gripping story moving along at a breathless brisk pace, takes time to develop the extremely sympathetic lead characters, treats the rather absurd premise with admirable seriousness, generates a tremendous amount of nerve-wracking claustrophobic tension, and stages the bloody'n'brutal alligator attacks with heart-pumping go-for-the-throat gusto. Moreover, the alligators are real scary and ferocious while the CGI effects are quite impressive and convincing. Best of all, this movie has a right'n'tight no-nonsense B-grade sensibility to it that in turn ensures that this picture never gets dull or overstays its welcome. An on the money nail-biter.",Crawl
6,BA_Harrison,"If it keeps on rainin', levee's goin' to break.",8,23 August 2019,"Does Crawl actually do for alligators what Jaws did for sharks? Well, no, not quite.Alexandre Aja's 'gators in da house movie is a rollicking reptilian romp, for sure, but it never hits the level of perfection of Spielberg's shark classic. Did we really think it would? Let's just say that, although Aja's creature feature is clearly lacking in the originality stakes (it's a lot like the 2012 film Bait, with 'gators instead of sharks, and a house instead of a supermarket), it certainly raises the bar for alligator movies, providing edge-of-the-seat action, plenty of claustrophobic suspense, lots of scares and a fair amount of chomping and bone-snapping and flesh-tearing.The film stars Kaya Scodelario as competitive swimmer Haley, who, concerned for her father's safety, drives to his Florida home during a category five hurricane. She discovers her old man (played by Barry Pepper) laying unconscious in the crawlspace under the house, bleeding with a compound fracture of the leg. As she tries to drag her dad out of the gradually flooding space, Haley is attacked by a huge gator, one of a pair that have made their way into the house through a storm drain. Trapped underground, with the water pouring in, Haley and her father must find a way to escape before they drown or are eaten.Aja keeps the tension rising steadily with the water level, with Haley having a few very close encounters with the scaly beasts, leaving her just a little perforated. A few secondary characters are less lucky, being torn apart in gory fashion. Even when father and daughter make it out of the crawlspace, the threat isn't over: when the levee breaks, the whole house is flooded, and more hungry gators come a-calling, leading to a white-knuckle final act guaranteed to excite all the way up to the closing song: Bill Haley's 'See You Later Alligator'.",Crawl
7,paul_haakonsen,"Cheesy and campy, but good old fashioned horror entertainment...",6,28 September 2019,"Right, well initially I had some reluctance about sitting down to watch the 2019 movie ""Crawl"" given the rather poor reviews I had been reading of the movie in local media. But still, I was given the chance to sit down and watch ""Crawl"", and given the fact that I love movies and believe everything deserves a chance to be seen at least once, then of course I sat down to watch it.Turns out that I definitely does not share the opinions of the people whose reviews I had been browsing through, because I was more than genuinely entertained with ""Crawl"".Sure, the movie had its fair share of cheesy and campy moments, and there were times throughout the movie where you just cringed and curled up your toes, but this is a movie after all, not real life. This is meant for entertainment. And I was entertained. Indeed, things like water suddenly rising up to the roof of a building seemed so far out there that it was painful, and the fact that an alligator wasn't able to crash through a lousy plexiglass shower stall was just downright idiotic. But it was entertaining, and that is what mattered. A movie such as ""Crawl"" is not meant to be realistic, not even in the least bit, because if it was then the people would not have stood a chance against all those alligators and the rampart forces of nature.Now, there is a feeling of old school claustrophobic horror movie to ""Crawl"", and that worked so well in favor of the movie, especially because it often felt like you were trapped in the cellar alongside with Haley (played by Kaya Scodelario) and Dave (played by Barry Pepper).The special effects and CGI used in ""Crawl"" were good, very good actually, and the alligators were quite realistic. That definitely worked well in favor of the movie and the enjoyment of the movie.""Crawl"" is by no means a movie that revolutionizes the horror genre, nor is it a movie that brings anything new to the genre. But it is definitely entertaining and enjoyable for what it turned out to be.My rating of ""Crawl"" is a solid six out of ten stars.",Crawl
8,BandSAboutMovies,I had a blast!,5,9 January 2020,"Alexandre Aja may be known for High Tension and his remakes of The Hills Have Eyes, Maniac and Piranha, but this man against nature movie may be my favorite film he's done.Produced by Sam Raimi, the film has a heart at the center of its story - what it's like to grow up and perhaps move beyond the experience of your parents. Oh yeah - it also has a category five hurricane and numerous gigantic alligators that want to snack on human flesh.University of Florida swimmer Haley Keller (Kaya Scodelario, the Maze Runner films) gets a call from her sister Beth, telling her to get out of the state of Florida before Hurricane Wendy descends. Haley is more worried about her father (Barry Pepper, The Green Mile), who isn't answering his phone.She goes through a police blockade to check on him, finding his dog Sugar but not him. Heading back their abandoned family home, she finds her father knocked out and his escape cut off by several gigantic alligators.The rest of the film is pretty much a thrill ride - can Haley and her father escape the alligators and make it out of the storm? Will the dog survive? Can they swim fast enough?I really wish that I had seen this in a theater instead of alone on my couch. This movie demands a sold out show of people screaming all around you at every single jump scare. It's effective on your own, but it had to have been awesome with an audience.",Crawl
9,Coventry,Florida 2019 Hurricane Wendy Swim Team!,6,25 November 2019,"Sometimes, all you need to relax and release stress from work or life in general is a simple but effective, entertaining and undemanding horror movie with giant animals and dumb dialogues! It gets even better when the insignificant little summer pic is helmed by one of the most talented and competent horror directors of the last fifteen years. None other than Alexandre Aja (""The Hills have Eyes"", ""Horns"") traveled down to the Sunshine State for ""Crawl""; - a derivative but nevertheless intense and nail-biting creature feature in which a couple of potent alligators complicate an already tough category-5 hurricane even more! In spite of numerous warnings to evacuate, young Haley drives back directly into the eye of the storm to look for her father who isn't answering her phone calls. They both end up trapped in the parental house's crawlspace, surrounded by massive alligators that are joyfully swimming free in the streets and houses due to the high water level. The added value of Alexandre Aja is that he definitely makes the most out of the claustrophobic settings, and that he ensures 4 or 5 effectively scary jump scares. The plot is obviously very thin and lends itself for various dreadful cliches and predictable situations. Naturally all the family feuds will become settled during this ordeal, and Haley (a trained and semi-professional swimmer) will be forced to break her own personal record time to escape from the gators. Do you doubt she'll make it? Also, since the two protagonists are most likely to survive, every other poor sucker that enters the scenes is doomed to be torn apart by the alligators, whether they are plundering punks or heroic rescue workers.",Crawl

The premise and setting puts a new slant on things, which is nice to see. It's a two hander, where as a father and daughter pairing, Barry Pepper and Kaya Scodelario make up the bulk of the narrative - they are also under or in water for 98% of the film!

13,Hey_Sweden,"See you later, alligator.",6,7 October 2020,"""Crawl"" is a generally amusing but utterly ridiculous animal-attack thriller, built on a decent enough premise. Unfortunately, it ultimately sinks under the weight of its silliness. The setting is Florida, as a hurricane rages. Kaya Scodelario plays Haley, an athletic young woman concerned that she hasn't heard from her father Dave (Barry Pepper). Eventually she finds him, stuck inside the crawlspace underneath the old family house. As waters rise all around them, it turns out that the two of them will be BOTH stuck in that place while they are menaced by a ravenous, relentless group of gators.The movie isn't lacking in energy, or good pacing. Director Alexandre Aja does deliver enough thrills to make this tolerable, but the movie suffers from bad writing throughout. Just for one thing, characters are still able to function pretty well even after sustaining what should be VERY serious wounds. Add to that the fact that most of the characters are quite dumb. (You have to really be annoyed at Dave for causing the characters to end up in this situation. Did the moron not CARE that a hurricane was imminent?) With so many laugh or cringe-inducing moments, the audience is likely to start rooting for the reptiles by default, as this viewer did. The dialogue is quite bad, especially in scenes where Haley and Dave reminisce.At least the visual effects are good. The gators are very formidable antagonists, and the filmmakers do a decent job of leaving characters at the mercy of the elements. Scodelario and Pepper are up to the physical challenge of their roles; technically, their performances aren't bad. But with protagonists who seemingly have more than nine lives, you're never in any doubt as to how this will end.For this viewer, anyway, the movie *is* fun in a cheesy-B kind of way, but the audience truly has to be prepared to suspend all disbelief along the way.Six out of 10.",Crawl

15,zardoz-13,Gators Galore!!!,8,14 July 2019,"Hollywood has been making movies about ravenous alligators as far back as ""Sparrows"" (1926) when Mary Pickford guided a group of innocent, young orphans through a gator infested swamp. Twenty years ago, ""Lake Placid"" (1998) and its three sequels featured a large alligator with a voracious appetite. The first ""Lake Placid"" remains the best, so avoid the rest. Last year, Dwayne Johnson tangled with a supersized alligator in ""Rampage."" The Asylum has churned out its share of home video schlock about alligators, specifically ""Mega Python vs. Gatoroid"" (2011), as well as the gator's distantly related cousin the crocodile. Numerically, sharks reign as Hollywood's alpha predator in more than 50 movies than either alligators or crocodiles. The latest gator epic is ""Piranha 3D"" director Alexandre Aja's ""Crawl,"" a weather-beaten disaster saga co-starring Barry Pepper and Kaya Scodelario as father and daughter trapped in the basement of a southwest Florida house during a Category 5 hurricane. Reportedly, an incident involving an actual gator attack on humans during Hurricane Florence inspired this film.""Crawl"" reminded me of ""The Shallows"" because it takes place in one location. Meantime, this atmospheric, white-knuckled, nail-biting yarn will keep you just as alert, poised on the edge of your seat, as you wait for the next gator strike. Aja & ""Dark Feed"" scenarists Michael Rasmussen and Shawn Rasmussen have done an exemplary job of establishing the characters, the setting, and the conflict. Ignoring evacuation warnings, a daughter risks her life to save her father from dying in an isolated community that has been evacuated under the worst possible weather conditions. No sooner have the filmmakers confined father and daughter to a hopeless position than two, hideous, heavily scaled, twenty-foot-long carnivores scour the basement for them while more circle outside it. Most of the action occurs beneath the house as the flood waters rise ominously, and our hero and heroine bide their time patiently before they try to break out.Naturally, horror movies exaggerate evil because you're supposed to be frightened. Aja and his CGI wizards have forged some flawless gators that look remarkably believable. These gators are as ferocious as the gator in the crime thriller ""Eraser"" (1996) that a Witness Protection Specialist (Arnold Schwarzenegger) encountered. These reptiles act like black mambas. They see you. They devour you. At the very least, they snack on you, and the scary thing is how often father and daughter keep getting bitten but never shirk from their filial duty to fend for each other. Of course, real-life gators would be inclined to vamoose, but these melodramatic gators display no fear and hunt in groups. An overhead drone shot of a first responder in the water with gators approaching from all directions depicts their teamwork. The gators appear every bit as vicious as they sound when they crunch on the bones of their victims.Lately, life hasn't been a picnic for Haley Keller (Kaya Scodelario of ""The Maze Runner""), and her performance on the swim team at the University of Florida at Gainesville hasn't been what she expected. Haley's older sister Beth (Morfydd Clark of ""Love & Friendship"") rings her up because she hasn't been able to reach their father. Haley tries to contact him, but she fares no better. Finally, she ignores the stern warnings of the authorities, and she strikes out on her own. She finds her father at their childhood house which evokes memories of happier days with her mother and sister. Dave Keller (Barry Pepper of ""Saving Private Ryan"") was repairing the house when an alligator blundered into the basement and took a bite out of his shoulder. Dave has taken refuge behind a series of pipes that the gator can neither squeeze through nor destroy with its jaws. Imagine Haley's shock when she is confronted by one of these huge critters after she trotted down the stairs into the basement. Miraculously, she evades the big lizard, but loses her cell phone, and must risk her neck to retrieve it.Aja and his writers knew that cornering our hero and heroine under such circumstances generates spine-tingling suspense, but to concentrate strictly on them as they await their fate would exhaust our patience. When disasters strike, looters take advantage of the predicament, and ""Crawl"" has a family of brothers and sister looting a convenience store. They arrived by boat, and they are the only living beings that a desperate Haley sees as she struggles to come up with a plan-B. Little do these looters know what awaits them as several gators cruise in for a killing. The looters confiscate a money machine, but they never get to see the rewards of their crime. When these gators attack, they are fearless, and they swim in groups to maximize their attacks on humans. Naturally, the looters and later the authorities have no clue what lurks beneath the trembling flood waters, and they pay a tragic price for their ignorance.
The threat of death lurks constantly around Haley and Dave, and matters worsen throughout its scanty 87 minutes. Aja wrings considerable suspense out of Haley's desperate bursts of swimming to dodge the gators. Dave warns her not to swim out through a pipeline beneath the house because the gators entered the basement through it. Nevertheless, Haley finds no alternatives as the waters rise and swims cautiously along it until she glimpses a huge gator cruising past the opening. Like all stomach-churning chillers, ""Crawl"" knows when to spring unexpected jump scares on audiences. One of the scariest is a tree which bursts through a kitchen window with such spontaneity that it catches you off-guard. The cat and mouse game between Haley and the increasing number of gators heightens the horror and tension. At one point, she has her hand trapped in a gator's mouth and must free herself without losing her fingers.An ideal outing for either a rainy day or night, ""Crawl"" delivers thrills and chills galore with creatures that will make your skin crawl.",Crawl

19,view_and_review,"Crawl, Swim, Run, Escape",8,25 July 2019,"Last year it was a shark in The Meg, this year it's gators.At the behest of her sister, Haley (Kaya Scodelario) goes to check on their father during a hurricane. When she finds him in the crawl space under the house he's in a bad way. Soon she finds out that an alligator is the cause of his gruesome injuries. From that point the two of them are trying to survive alligators, their injuries, and the hurricane which is causing massive flooding.As director, Alexandre Aja did a superb job with the mood and atmosphere of this movie. As Haley goes into the crawl space to find her father we see how cramped and filthy it is. As a person who's gone under multiple houses I could completely sense and feel her careful timid movements under the house as she navigated through muck and around pipes and wiring. Then, with a furious hurricane outside and ferocious alligators inside it seemed like a no-win situation.There have been countless movies depicting a grave situation because of an animal or creature but not many in which the victims are severely restricted in their movement. Cujo comes to mind where there were only two captives in a very small area. Likewise, Crawl focuses on two characters: Haley and her father, Dave (Barry Pepper). They are hopelessly trapped by a couple of large alligators with flood waters rising. Escaping is going to take some risks and some luck.It wouldn't be a horror movie if we didn't see the large reptiles in action. There were some kills and maimings and both were vicious. There were a few flinch inducing moments when the gators inflicted harm. This movie didn't go for jump scares or spooky, it went for our base natural fears. They elicited that primal fear we all have of toothy large predators. You won't be hiding your face behind your hands but you will be careful the next time you visit Florida. There were no lighthearted funny moments just raw real survival. It was intense, claustrophobic, filthy, bloody and wet.Everything was within the realm of believability too. The movie took place in Florida during a hurricane. The alligators, though large, were not abnormally so. Sure, the alligators seemed to be overly aggressive and had a taste for human meat but that's not far-fetched. These weren't chemically altered gators or otherwise mutated gators, they were just opportunistic gators that found the right time to feed.Lake Placid has always been the gator/croc go to movie. I think Crawl may have just supplanted it.",Crawl

You never have time to think, and that's just as well because, when you do, it's not good. For instance, I never realised that alligator bites were relatively easy to escape from, and caused little problems with mobility afterwards.Oh, and I won't spoil it, but there is a moment when one of the characters acts with such massive stupidity that it pulled me right out of the movie.

It is however a visual spectacle.Strong winds are one of the scariest things, as you can't do anything about it. That fear wasn't felt through the characters. They survive a few too many attacks, while all secondary characters get butchered instantly. Also surprised the dog isn't eaten. The acting's fine, without much of a script to work with.",Crawl
22,kannibalcorpsegrinder,"Far more fun than it should be, though it does have a few minor issues",9,29 December 2019,"When a hurricane warning hits, a woman races to her old home to get her dad out of the area only to find the storm has brought a swarm of crocodiles into their home which traps them inside, forcing the two to try to survive both the creature and the surging water to escape alive.This one was an incredibly fun and enjoyable effort. Among the film's best aspects is the actual build-up in the first half that gets this one ready for the carnage to ensure. The realization of the father left behind in the middle of the hurricane comes off right after learning of the necessary swimming prowess to come into play later, giving everything we need in a quick, economical fashion. As the ensuing search towards finding him in the driving rain where the pounding rain escalating the danger of the situation with the impending lack of outside help as the ongoing evacuation keeps the authorities outside away from them while also providing the necessary explanations for why their phones won't work due to downed powerlines or wasted batteries, leaving this with some solid suspense. With them trapped by the storm, the series of confrontations against the creatures are top-notch. The first encounter where the creature attacks her trying to get him out of the basement gives this a fantastic start, much like the great sequence later on where they realize the second one's down there as she tries to get the radio to call for help. A later plan to escape through the tunnel they came in provides some great tension with the race to get to the blocked stairs and being forced to go through their lair to go outside which has some fantastic action of the crocs swimming around. As well as the tense finale where they have to escape the flooding house where the race to get the flooding water under control, the crocs showing up at the right time ads some fine action and brutal confrontations, these offer up some fantastic action scenes that make the crocs look good with a great, times indistinguishable mix of animatronics and CGI mixed together. These are the films' best qualities as this one does have a few minor issues. The biggest problem here is the generally flimsy story that can't support a full-length feature-length endeavor. The idea of the characters' trapped in a flooding house works in short bursts as it does here, where this has to continually introduce other characters outside to interfere in their plans simply as a means to bump up the running time. Scenes like the looters at the market across the street or the sacrificial officers who are immediately ripped to shreds simply reek of cannon fodder to stretch out what's going on while the repetitive quality of dropping them back into a house for another round of stalking speaks to the film running on empty to get to a respectable full-length feature. Had this been made into a short or featured more family members coming down to check on him so it organically adds more bodies, this one would've been a little easier to swallow but it's not that bad overall.Rated R: Graphic Violence and Graphic Language.",Crawl
23,FlashCallahan,You're Luggage......,8,13 September 2019,"Starring that bloke who could have been famous but then he was in Battlefield Earth, Crawl should fail on every level, Deemed by some as 'Jaws with Alligators' or 'Snappy', I had some trepidation going into this, especially as Aja directed the awful Piranha remake. But then I remembered Switchblade Romance....When a hurricane hits her Florida hometown, Haley ignores the evacuation orders to search for her missing father. After finding him injured in their family home, the two of them become trapped by the rapid floodwaters.With the storm strengthening, Haley and and her father discover an even greater threat than the rising water level -- a pack of alligators.From start to finish, this is a high concept B-movie, and wears it's badge proud. The jump scares for once are genuine, as the makers don't follow the trope of the quiet... quiet.... quiet.... Bang!! formula that recent horror films have followed for almost two decades. When these scares happen, there is no build up, no preparation, they just hit you, and this only goes in the films favour.After a very brief first act, the film focuses on only sets that would make a claustrophobic run for the exit. These people are trapped, and not only are the Alligators getting closer, the water is rising, and desperation is setting in.We have a few atypical supporting characters, rookie cops, looters, the sister from far away, but they don't really hinder the overall tension of the narrative, most of them are just an entree for our future handbags.Oh, and just to add more to the tension, we have a dog called Sugar, who is in the mix. A really cute, lovable dog might I add.The script is perfunctory, some of the action is pretty laughable in the 'how did they?....' sort of way.But Aja keeps the running time slim and the tension at a relative unbearable level, that you forgive the jumping of the Alligator every now and again.It's a fun creature feature that could have popped up via The Asylum or SYFY.But luckily, someone gave the story and the concept a little bit of love.",Crawl

Unlike many modern horror movies, Crawl has no P C or strong social messages which dilutes the story development. Crawl has real life characters which are ugly, flawed and believable. All great horror movies need and have great character development where the audience feels the pathos for the characters. The daughter/father stressed relationship with a stressed family gives a real feel for Crawl. The viewer does not even like the characters at first, but slowly develops empathy for the father/daughter relationship. A slow start story with a hardship of competitive swimming. Crawl has a strained family relationship of phone conversations which drives the stressed daughter into finding her dad. A hard edged story which gristly make the viewer wanting more; as the story rolling onto a hurricane and town full of gators. The directing, acting and gator effects creates a story of struggle with the elements. A story of survival. It is a story that could actually happen which makes it even more believable.

But I can see why people who score it much lower, if you're a bit picky about things that make no sense at all, taking bad decisions, things that would just never happen at all then you won't like it. Those things bugged me the most in this movie. For example at one point the main character is swimming in three meter deep water and a couple minutes later the water is just waist high at the exact same spot, it's those tiny but frequent details that bring down the quality of a movie, even in this genre. But the CGI's were well done, the acting was okay, the story has suspense and that's the only thing that really saves it. But for credibility you shouldn't watch this, it's bad decision after bad decision, in situations that make no sense at all. But Crawl is entertaining, let just keep it at that.",Crawl

But, there's also Kingdom of the Spiders and a personal favorite: Piranha 3D (2010.) And while this was realistic and the effects were AMAZING - kudos for no fake looking alligators, the movie was so bland, predictable and brought so little to the subgenre, I was ultimately very bored. It's not promising that this movie mostly reminded me of Hurricane Heist, an incredibly inept and stupid movie. Not recommended.

SPOILERS
i'm going to try to list as many things as i can remember. the first and maybe worst thing for me happened very early in the movie. she goes into this ""crawl space"" that's more like a basement. when i first saw it i assumed she would be able to stand. she starts crawling in dirty mud-water, with mice everywhere, giant piles of feces, and dead and rotting animals. so i start thinking, maybe i'm wrong. but they would show these angles that clearly shows there is at least 5 feet of room to stand, if not more. at worst, she would have to crouch a little. but give me back pain over crawling in disgustingness. and to make it worse, the rest of the movie they show them standing up like it's normal. W....... T....... H...... drove me nuts. this is more of an idiotic director decision than a dumb character decisionit's going to take to long to list everything so how about just the worst dumb character decision. they are in a safe area where the crocs can't get em. but the phone is outside of this area. she needs to get it! she's gonna do it! jumps over the barrier. get it quick and come, 2 seconds no problem. but she needs her dad to distract with conversation.okay fine. dad give her an easy convo to keep her distracted. nope, dad starts talking about serious stuff that's been brewing for years. are you DUMB. daughter says dad stop i need to focus. BUT YOU ASKED FOR A DISTRACTION.this is all happening while she's in the dangerous area. a minute passes. the phone isn't that far!!! whatever, finally she got it. now she'll run back to the safe area and make a call..............................................................................................................................................................are you KIDDING ME. she starts making a call in the dangerous area. BRO. BRO. BRO. i wanted to flip out. this is unacceptable. either the director is such an oblivious moron who doesn't understand the situation he's directing, or he knows and intentionally did it this way to create more tension using a scenario that makes zero possible sense and make you want the character to die from how dumb they are. UNACCEPTABLE.of course the gator sees her during the call, she loses it and it gets stepped on. guys. how could you possibly give this a positive review. this is just one thing. i wrote 5 paragraphs about one, just ONE, dumb moment. there are many many more",Crawl
28,Robert_duder,Aja does it again,8,15 July 2019,"Alexandre Aja is my favorite horror director/producer just based on Piranha 3D, High Tension, The Hills Have Eyes and Evil Dead. Those four films were so phenomenal that I wanted to see Crawl just based on the fact that this was his latest movie. If you want suspense, Crawl will practically make you uncomfortable the entire film. It's simply shot with a minimum cast and it still manages to put you on the edge and tell a solid story. I don't know how else they could have told it but I could have done without the ""swimmer"" sub-story which was a little on the nose and obvious. I don't know enough about Alligators to know how real this could be but the amount of times these two are chomped on by alligators and keep going felt a little unbelievable. However, the tension and suspense is enough to keep you going and you root for them throughout. Kaya Scodelario is an excellent lead in the film. She's very down to earth and relatable and she makes her scenes believable. Barry Pepper is also good as her father and they have great chemistry opposite each other. The supporting cast is fine but barely get any screen time to make a difference. Despite complaints about the CGI in the film, I thought it was quite good. Great movie, great suspense, solid story, absolutely worth checking out for something a little different. 8.5/10",Crawl
29,Pjtaylor-96-138044,Just keep swimming.,7,24 August 2019,"Despite taking itself, essentially, entirely seriously, 'Crawl (2019)' requires a fair bit of suspension of disbelief. I mean, its computer-generated gators often straight-up leap out of the water. Still, its grounded tone, convincing visuals and compelling central performances keep it from feeling silly. In fact, it's a tense and enjoyable affair throughout. There's not all that much in the way of theming, but the core players are developed a decent amount and their relationship is believable. The flick is far more focused on in-the-moment survival than anything else. The constantly rising water, caused by an especially well-realised storm, acts as an apt 'ticking clock', adding to the pressure felt by the more obviously dangerous creatures swimming within it. In general, the horror leans more towards suspense than jump-scares. It's never scary, but it's usually taut. The tight plot only takes a noticeable detour once, otherwise keeping things pacy and palpable. It's devoid of any meaningful denouement, though; this makes for a pretty unsatisfying ending and doesn't mesh well with the heavily-loaded opening and intermittent flashbacks. Of course, what would be included in these final moments is sort of implied; if you've been following the characters' inner journeys at all, you'll easily be able to come up with the off-screen conclusion. Overall, the movie is surprisingly entertaining. Sure, it has a schlocky premise, but it earnestly crafts a rather fun experience around it. 7/10",Crawl
30,ThomasDrufke,Apex Predator,8,1 August 2019,"This summer has certainly been a letdown on many levels for big budget films (aside from the Disney flicks) but there are a few hidden gems that no one expected to be good, one of them is Crawl. As with Stuber, Crawl had an atrocious marketing campaign. From cheesy looking performances to special effects straight out an 80's film, the only hope for Crawl was for it to have the unexpected reception of films like 47 Meters Down or The Shallows, both were surprising hits. Crawl contains some of the best ""scares"" of the summer while also telling a heartfelt father-daughter story amidst a deadly hurricane, which happens to bring out some terrifying gators. It certainly doesn't fall short on the cheese at times, but that's more than okay when you hit on the heart and horror. Crawl is infinitely better than I expected.8.1/10",Crawl

I never expected this low-budget film to have such great visuals, and contain disaster elements as well. There are only two mention-able characters in the film, Haley (the daughter, played by Kaya Scodelario) and Dave (the father, played by Barry Pepper). Their characters are well set-up and both actors does an incredible job. Kaya was (almost) just as good and believable as Blake Lively was in 'The Shallows'.The creature effects are incredibly realistic. The alligators are scary as hell and they certainly mean business. 'Crawl' doesn't waste time with a slow build-up. It literally plunges you in the deep end.

The direction which was made by Alexandre Aja was below average with no much action and nothing but scary, and I don't count some silly jump-scares. The interpretations of both Barry Pepper who played as Dave and Kaya Scodelario who played as Haley were nothing more than average.

The plot follows Haley (Kaya Scodelario) heading back home to where a category 5 hurricane is coming. She is heading home to get her father Dave (Barry Pepper). When she gets home and finds him injured in a crawlspace. They both get trapped by an alligator that is surrounding the place. With the clock ticking on the hurricane that is flooding the area and before the eye of the storm arrives. They both will have to fight for their survival.The plot is a simple survival horror story about father and daughter being stucked in a crawlspace with their injuries and trying to find a way to get around the alligators. It does have some decent backdrop story with the relationship the father and daughter has. Such as the mother leaving the family cause he was focused on his daughters swimming league. Which shows the bond they both have and are trying to survive the hurricane and the alligators.The film is very fast paced. It moves quickly. Next thing you know, Haley is trying to get out of the crawlspace and help her father escape. They come across more victims to the alligators that try to help. It ends in a blood bath. When they do get on top and trying to escape the fast approaching storm. They are forced to survive the waves and the flooding. And the several alligators that are fast, scary, and they can jump out of the water at any given moment. Yes, the film does have a few jump scares that will make you jump. There are some cringing gory scenes with the characters getting attacked.Alexandre Aja is back with his horror direction. (He directed The Hills Have Eyes and Piranha). Which he builds the intense suspense throughout from the jump scares. The loud music score that makes you feel unease. A very sharp exciting sequences of the characters fighting to survive. It only slows down for a brief moment for the characters to catch a breath to bandage their wounds and share their emotional family story. Then, it picks up the pace with more intense thrilling scenes.Kaya Scodelario and Barry Pepper did great playing their characters. It delivers with their father and daughter story of them recovering from the family changes with the mother leaving.Overall, Crawl is a good disaster horror film.

40,eddie_baggins,Too serious for its own good,4,30 October 2019,"For a film about killer alligators stalking a daughter and her dad in the midst of a category 5 hurricane that's hit the state of Florida, Crawl unfortunately takes itself far too seriously to be outright enjoyable, even if there are moments throughout Alexandre Aja's creature feature that show glimmers of what could've been.Becoming a somewhat surprising mid-level box office success earlier this year, earning close to $100 million worldwide of a small-scale budget of $13.5 million, this Sam Raimi backed effort clearly found itself in a marketplace that was crying out for a popcorn munching creature filled horror/thriller but it's a shame Aja and his creative team weren't able to find that solid middle ground that's found in similar over the top efforts such as The Deep Blue Sea or Arachnophobia.From the moment we're introduced to Kaya Scodelario's driven swimmer Haley and join her on her quest to check up on her gruff single-father Dave (played by method man Barry Pepper) in the middle of the hurricane hitting their home town, we start to become aware that Crawl is taking matters very seriously, even if its very concept, poorly done special effects and daft character decisions suggest it's a film that really should just be having an over the top ride with its crazy concept.Aja is a talented director but his rather restrained here and while Scodelario and Pepper are also talented in their own rights, they don't get to unleash any B-movie goodness here as their held back by a large collection of deep and meaningful life musings as they attempt to escape the confounds of their alligator patrolled basement, ensuring that we as an audience suffer from a lack of fun and energy that should've been priority number one.The other big roadblock placed right in front of us viewers (should we care to look) is that the supposed inescapable surrounds Haley and Dave have found themselves in are surrounded by rain soaked and totally movable bricks, that would've taken mere minutes to smash through with the ample tools they have been provided within the basement surrounds.For films like Crawl, it's good to switch your brain off and just forgive and forget but Aja constantly frames our survivors in places that just mere millimetres away scream ""escape here"" and with our characters not even once attempting to escape in any other way bar past blood thirsty alligators, things go off the rails quickly in the suspension of disbelief stakes.It's a shame Crawl didn't look to just embrace its more out-there narrative and alligator infested carnage more so, as while there are still things to like here, at the end of the day Crawl fails to satisfy audiences thirst for another truly fun and energetic bout of creature feature chaos.Final Say -A disappointing outcome for a film that had the chance to grab hold of its silliness and make a fun time out of it, Crawl is too po-faced to be recommendable even if it offers a few glimpses of a much better film.2 electrical cables out of 5",Crawl
41,TheMovieDiorama,Crawl floods its claustrophobic gator-infested environment with sheer stupidity.,5,31 August 2019,"Like the rest of you, I enjoy a decent B-movie that knows when to fully exercise its ridiculous premise. Last year's 'The Meg', whilst not fully embellishing its 'Jaws' escapade, was a prime example of being mildly amusing and self-aware. Aja's alligator plagued hurricane unfortunately plays out with an all too serious tone that prevents the full ""creature feature"" from emerging. A daughter ignores all hurricane warnings to drive back to her father's house, who isn't answering her phone calls, and find themselves trapped in a flooding crawlspace that is swamped with hungry alligators.Right, let's address the alligator in the flooded street. Yes, the wild alligator is no where near as predatory or territorial as the ones displayed here. Hollywood adores exaggerating fauna in order to induce new fears into the minds of the mainstream. Atleast sharks aren't whirling around in a tornado or tarantulas aren't spewing lava everywhere, so credit must be given for some plausibility I guess. Now, my biggest gripe with Crawl is not with the ravenous wildlife and blustery weather, but actually the stupidity of its characters and absurd plot conveniences (you know how much I ""love"" conveniences).Immediately, Hayley drives to her father's house in spite of the entire town being evacuated due to the approaching stage five hurricane. Y'know, Katrina levels of ferocity. Strike one. Next, the rain. They use it to traverse the treacherous waters, providing a fitting distraction for the gators. It's been raining for the entire film. The moment they need it to downpour, it stops. For a minute. Really? Strike two! The alligators have a numerous number of chomps at the father and daughter, like hungry hippos. Thrown around like rag dolls and still able to Tarzan their way through the crawlspace. Other civilians though? One bite and they are doomed. Strike three! Out swimming three gators swarming in from different directions. Access to a gun. Helicopter at the precise moment. Heavy object blocking an alternate exit. Strike four, five, six and seven. Heck, you're outta here!Seriously, there are so many conveniences that the alligators didn't stand a chance at getting some delicious Scodelario meat. And unfortunately does reduce much of the tension that Aja actually lovingly produced. There are moments, particularly when our characters are confined to the claustrophobic restrictions of the crawlspace, where Aja fully utilised the surroundings to create tension. Accompanied by a physically demanding performance from Scodelario and an intricately developed dynamic between her and Pepper, the excitement was constantly flowing throughout the tight hour and a half runtime.Literally every minute is used to its full potential, making for an engaging thriller that has enough bite to thrill many. Just a shame that the excessively obvious CGI beasts, narrative stupidity and plethora of plot conveniences prevent Crawl from being the creature feature that it deserves to be.",Crawl

I'm all for less-than-serious horror movies on occasion but not when the best in the industry are wasting their time making them. Luckily 'Crawl' does take itself a lot more seriously. It's a brave thing to do actually these days, try and take yourself seriously as a creature based horror movie, because if you aren't able to pull it off the whole thing can look very silly. Luckily though Aja is good enough to make it work.The pacing of this film is incredible. After a brief 15 minutes or so of set-up at the beginning the movie just explodes off the screen (almost literally) and from there it never lets up. The entire runtime from there on out is an edge-of-your-seat thrill ride. In fact one of the few problems I had with the movie (which isn't really a problem at all when you think about it) is that because the movie is so intense throughout, it struggles to raise the stakes for the final sequence. And so you are left feeling like it hasn't built up to the big finale, when in actuality the whole film is on the scale of an ordinary movie's finale.There are terrifically done jump-scares in this movie too. I'm very against cheap jump-scares that aren't warranted or naturally occurring within the story (and there are a couple of those admittedly) but some of them are both warranted and will make you leap out of your seat. I really enjoyed 'Crawl'. In a lot of people's hands this movie would not have worked, but Aja nails it like he usually does and the end result is a fantastic horror film.",Crawl
49,jadavix,Some good moments - but no real suspense,6,26 December 2019,"A girl goes to check on her dad during a Category 5 (the worst kind) hurricane in Florida. She finds him trapped in the crawlspace under his house, menaced by hungry alligators.The movie has a couple of surprisingly effective moments, but after the first one, immediately squanders any sense of suspense these could have generated. Picture this: the character gets chomped on the leg by a massive alligator, and then dragged backwards and tossed around. You're thinking, wow. I didn't think they would kill them off so quickly. But then, whaddya know, she gets free, escapes, and doesn't seem bothered by the wound at all.I know alligators are basically the pussy version of what we have here in Australia - crocodiles - but come on. That would have taken her leg off at the very least.When you know there is no chance of the main characters dying, you become less invested. I don't know when makers of suspense/thriller/horror movies are going to realise that.Thus the movie doesn't really work as a whole piece, but I was impressed by Kaya Scodelario's performance. She does a convincing American accent, and a good job of carrying the movie.",Crawl

This is like one of those many trashy movies that the Sci Fi Channel churn out, basic plot, poor effects, bad acting and some serious over the top situations. Well this is a notch above those, but not by much. Considering the previous outputs of director Alexandra Aja and producer Sam Raimi I had hoped for more than just a fairly dumb popcorn movie. I'm just glad that I didn't pay to watch it. Any credibility that this movie may have had went went out the window when our heroine survives THREE alligators attacks, including an underwater death roll. we do get a few decent jump scares, the pace is quite quick and Serbia does a convincing job of being Florida (I didn't realise that until the end credits).
Crawl is OK as a turn your brain off, popcorn movie but with the talent behind it I can't help but feel a little disappointed.",Crawl

This movie was entertaining with great action and special effects; and I, personally, loved the father/daughter storyline. Was the movie great? No. Hell, I wouldn't even say it was as good as Lake Placid (Betty White stole the show in that movie that was way better than it should have been); but is this worth watching? Hell yes.

This is a pretty good 'B' movie that is based on a true alligator event that occurred during Hurricane Florence. It takes place in Florida, where a category 5 hurricane is coming on shore. People are told to evacuate but Barry is trying to ride it out. Kaya and Morfydd are his two daughters that are worried about him. Moryfdd lives in Boston and calls her sister Kaya-who lives about an hour away from Barry-to go and check up on him. Both sisters have called him but have not gotten any response from him. When Kaya gets to his house, she discovers what the problem is-besides the hurricane. Alligators have come looking for food and some have even come in Barry's basement, since the flooding waters are getting higher and higher. Ross plays the local policeman that comes looking for stragglers that have not evacuated yet.
It's rated ""R"" for bloody creature violence and language and has a running time of 1 hour & 27 minutes.

56,parry_na,Tense disaster romp!,9,8 May 2021,"For a disaster film involving flooding and alligators, 'Crawl' does exactly as it says on the tin. Luckily for the viewer, Director Alexandre Aja and his cast and crew ensure that the resultant ride is every bit as spectacular as it could possibly be.Apparentrly this is based on a true story. That would be quite a loose adaption, I'm thinking, because the characters of Hayley and her father Dave (impressively lunged Kaya Scodelario and Barry Pepper) go through absolute turmoil that might well have ended the lives of those not lucky enough to be on the silver screen: some critics have criticised 'Crawl' for the fantastical nature of its plentiful near-death moments. My opinion is that, although a straighter take on the story maybe more sympathetic factually speaking, it wouldn't be as thrilling as this - after all - it is a drama, not a documentary.I enjoyed every single moment. The characters are introduced well and given a relevant back story. The alligators seem to be a mix of real creatures and CGI, but I couldn't tell the difference, and the images of savage flooding are faultlessly created. My score is 9 out of 10.",Crawl

She's actually kind of blase about the 'gator, I mean, characters in this kind of movie need to have a lot of composure but they didn't really sell to me that there was that much threat. They have an unearned flashback really early on.The special effects are superb even though its CGI even if they really should have considered animatronics for close ups.They really should have considered a far more comedic tone and a less toxically masculine heroine. Why can't a tough female be brave enough to show inner vulnerability? Oh well. There's also a scene where she talks on video chat in the changing room while changing and we don't get to see stuff. I don't go to the movies just for that kind of thing but it was still a bit of a middle finger to the audience.The climax did not feel like a climax and its disarming just how sudden the credits are.

58,alindsay-al,An Average over the top monster film,5,31 May 2020,"This film recently made it's way to Sky and I saw it was only 80 minutes long so I decided to quickly watch the film Crawl and here is my review for it. The premise of the film sees a young girl have to go back to her home during a tornado to find her Father when Aligators attack causing her to use her skills to attempt to survive.
Main Character
Kaya Scodelario plays the lead in the film and she is fine, she plays the strong female lead well and you can't help but want to root for her to succeed against the Gators so she does her role fine. I mean there is no depth to her character at all and I get a film like this isn't meant to be an interesting character study but it could have done with something to make the character better and give you an even bigger reason to care and support her.
Supporting Characters
Barry Pepper plays her father in the film and again I thought he did a fine job, they have pretty good chemistry here and he has the funniest most cheesy parts of the film down. Though there are certain aspects of the character explained but never really explored and you wonder why exactly it was here but when it is here you have to do something with it. Their really aren't anybody else of note here, just some people kind of set up as sacrificial lambs for the gators but you don't care because the characters don't care all too much. The Gators as a threat are fine, but Jaws they are not, they are sometimes terrifying and sometimes idiots plus the film really can't make its mind up how many gators there actually are as it changes throughout the film.
Story
The story again isn't what is important here, I mean it does a successful job in making you care about the lead character so in there it works and deserves credit. But as mentioned it introduces certain story aspects that feel forced and don't play out at all and the film doesn't really do much for a while in the film with the characters just staying in a basement. Also this film ends really abruptly, I wasn't asking for much more but maybe 5 minutes more to wrap up some of these things but we didn't get it.
Script
The script has the cheesy one liners you would expect here and a bit of the drama works. But there is too much wasted dialogue about certain things that don't matter to the situation they are in, they think it's fleshing out the characters but it isn't doing anything at least not for me.
Style
One thing this film deserves credit for is that it's style is very suspensful, you are on edge like the characters and you feel like you are in the basement too. Also, this film knows what it is and is like I said only 80 minutes long, it doesn't try and force a 2 hour runtime because it knows it shouldn't. But as I said there are some boring parts of the film for me and the characters interactions feel like they could have just been cut out or made better. Plus the CGI for the gators is poor, I get they didn't have a huge budget but they just look really fake.
Overall
Overall, this is exactly what you would expect. An over the top silly monster film that knows what it is, if you have 80 minutes and want something dumb and loud to have on the background then why not just don't expect the next Jaws here.",Crawl
59,CubsandCulture,This is a fun ride,8,22 October 2019,"This is a creature feature that makes the most of the concept. The film is intense. The gags are largely unpredictable. And the the director manages to keep the tension ebbing and flowing the way to it needs to make the film thrill ride. You can't really ask for much more.Fortunately, the script is largely not dumb. The characters, largely, behave as people would. The characters have just enough distinctiveness to make them more than tropes. And the acting is not annoying. Yeah the gore is more than it would be and man there are lot of jump scares but overall this was a fun film.",Crawl

The most of the movie is predictable, slow and boring and doesn't offer anything exciting. We have seen similar movies in the past and the movie and movie doesn't offer anything fresh.The climax of the movie is stretched and is very much predictable, the end of the movie also doesn't excites much.

Filmed in Belgrade with the right feel of tropical Florida under a category 5 hurricane. How they managed that, unclear! Kudos to the producers.(-) Some miraculous escapes and happenings in relation to our hero vs the gators, which can be neglected as being part of the thrills of the movie and the continuity of the story.I expected it to be cheesy and weak. It was none of the sort.That was a tale of courage and survival, beautifully and believably unfolded with a more than nice cinematic experience.
Even the blood color and texture, being it in the water or out of it, were right and mostly correctly done.
Attentions to details were great and all those tiny points are what makes a movie a great one; not mandatorily having a super big budget or the false pretense to be a potential A movie.The message of it was really positive with thrilling sensations.
It deserves a 9, thanks to the Director, Writers and Producers' good job, among them Sam Raimi.",Crawl
66,kirbylee70-599-526179,NO GATOR-AID,9,21 October 2019,"It's October and what better time than now to watch a movie that will provide some chills, some spill and all out mayhem? If that's the type of movie you enjoy then by all means watch CRAWL. Released this summer to theaters and making its way to disc this week you'll find it entertaining, frightening and will do for swimming what JAWS did years ago.Kaya Scodelario plays Haley, a champion swimmer who's still trying to insure she stays on the team. After a practice she gets a call from her sister Beth asking if she's heard from their father. Haley hadn't gotten the word yet that a major hurricane has shifted and is headed their direction. Beth hasn't been able to reach their father and wants Haley to go check on him.She drives through the pouring rain and makes her way to her place to pick up her dog first. She then heads to her father's place. Searching the house she finds his phone but no dad. The door to the crawlspace beneath the house is open so she goes looking for him. Finding her father (Barry Pepper) wounded, she tries to drag him to the steps only to find a full grown alligator blocking her way and hungry to finish off the pair.She makes her way back behind some pipes that prevent the alligator from reaching them. Resuscitating her father she learns that he was beneath the house trying to block some holes before heading out when he was attacked. The alligator came up through the drainage pipe. Now the pair need to find a way out while avoiding the alligator.Haley sees her cell phone and realizes she can call for help if she can just get to it and avoid the alligator. As she reaches it she discovers that he's not alone and a second alligator is in the crawlspace with them. She's attacked and wounded and loses the phone, but finds a safe area to hide in. Now it's just finding a way to either get help or escape from beneath the house without being eaten alive.In addition to the duo in jeopardy a sub-story focuses on the father/daughter relationship between the two. They've had problems in the past and she's blamed herself for the divorce her parents went through. Between moments of finding escape the pair discuss the reality of what caused this to happen and rediscover one another.So does the movie work? Can you make an alligator frightening? Absolutely. Director Alexander Aja (known for his work on THE HILLS HAVE EYES remake, MIRRORS and PIRANHA 3D) brings his skill with creating a tense film within the confines of a small location. Almost the entire film takes place beneath the house with a few scenes and the last 15 minutes or so taking place upstairs. And all of it taking place in the midst of a hurricane. When the film ends you'll check your fingers to see if they've pruned having watched so much water cascade through the house.To make a movie truly frightening takes skill and not overdoing the revelations of the creature in question. That was one of the things that made JAWS such a great film. It wasn't seeing the shark from start to finish but the build up to the point where it was finally seen. Aja does the same here but does end up showing it more than that film. The alligators are all CGI but not overused. It makes them believable in the situation here and all the more frightening. The alligators also have a tendency to show up unexpectedly throughout the film as well creating a number of ""jump"" scenes that will have anyone sitting close to your TV leaping back as they pop out.Scodelario makes a credible heroine and loyal daughter who finds the time in the midst of potential tragedy to make peace with her father. Pepper, known for roles in films like SAVING PRIVATE RYAN and THE GREEN MILE, plays his role mostly injured from start to finish but brings that believability factor into play as Scodelario's father. With the exception of a few other characters who mostly become lunch for the alligators, the film is carried by these two and they do a great job of it.While this may not be spooks and ghosts, goblins and ghouls, it does offer a nice frightening movie that can be enjoyed for the month of October. The film is rated R for violence and it is quite gory at times. If your children have no problem with that, or with going near water to swim anytime soon, then pre-teens might enjoy this one. I found it a treat and could easily watch it again.",Crawl

When i heard that Barry Pepper was gonna be a main lead in a monster movie about killer gators & it's directed by Alexander Aja (The Hills Have Eyes, remake, Mirrors) & it was produced by the Horror legend Sam Raimi, i was too excited & it delivered.Barry Pepper is such a great actor & is a million times better & more interesting than the typical boring & bland ""Hollywood"" stars such as Brad Pitt & Tom Cult Cruise & Sam Worthington & Jai Courtney & i like him even more than all the ""Chris's"" that are favourites at the moment (Hemsworth,Pine,Pratt,Evans) & he's proven himself as an incredible actor with powerful serious performances in ""Saving Private Ryan"" & ""The Green Mile"" & ""The Snow Walker"" & ""25th Hour"" & ""Seven Pounds"" & ""The Three Buriels"" & ""We Were Soldiers"" he even fits into big franchise films such as ""The Maze Runner: The Scorch Trials & The Death Cure"" & stole every scene he was in & had a good role in the mega budget Blockbuster ""The Lone Ranger"" & had a decent part in the Noir style Mark Wahlberg Thriller ""Broken City"" & stole the show completely in the remake of the Classic Western ""True Grit"" i mean Pepper is a chameleon of an actor that truly becomes the character & literally transforms into the role & that's dedication from a true artist, he's ridiculously underrated still & i Don't understand why? But I'm waiting & will be watching for his next knockout performance or role. Checkout Pepper's filmography as he's done alot of stuff & pretty much all his work has been decent to brilliant.At the heart of this gripping Monster movie is a nice sweet story of a Daughter & father reconnecting & bonding together, even if it is under extreme terrifying circumstances.The Alligators look Amazing & as good as they can look using c.g.i & practical fx, the look of the town is great with flood & the intense atmosphere of things are gonna get worse & they always do.Some of ""Crawl"" is very predictable but it's not a problem as it's such a fast paced slick flick under an hour & half & it's non-stop excitement & fun.""CRAWL"" is an easy watch & one i will put on lots in the future as i love these creature feature flicks like ""Lake Placid"" & ""Jaws"" & ""Anaconda"" among others, these are good fun survival Horror Thriller's & now ""Crawl"" can be added to the list of Great Creature features!!!So glad Barry Pepper finally stars in a fun Monster movie!!!",Crawl
68,kluseba,Be quick or be dead,6,23 July 2019,"Alexandre Aja's Crawl certainly is no spectacular movie but it's entertaining and gets to the point.At the very beginning, I wasn't too sure about that. The viewers get introduced to a young competitive swimmer who has a slightly strained relationship with her sister. She also has taken some distance from her father after her parents' divorce. We are also introduced to a police officer who seems to know her sister and her rather well. None of these plot elements are significantly going to be picked up again and only serve to quickly introduce the charactets and the plot in less than ten minutes.What follows is a fight for survival as the competitive swimmer tries to save her father from the basement of their family home as a hurricane intensifies and alligators roam the area.The special effects are surprisingly solid, the pace keeps going until the very last minute and the action scenes are rather realistic. Classifying this movie as a horror film would be inappropriate since there are only very few scary scenes. This is a fast-paces survival action flick.The movie also made me think about the Sunshine State and why anyone would live there. Florida is regularly hit by natural catastrophes, dangerous animals roam the state, there are numerous serial killer cases, there are thousands of noisy tourists around all year long and the state voted for Donald Trump during the last Presidential election.To keep it short, Crawl is an entertaining survival action film that grips you while it lasts but ultimately fails to leave a deeper impression. It's a good movie to watch at the cinema on a lazy night.",Crawl
69,Pairic,Sheer Existential Terror (and fun).,9,28 August 2019,"Crawl: You may have seen previous films about people trapped in flooded buildings being hunted by alligators or crocodiles but Crawl brings something new to the table and ir's not just human limbs. Plenty of arms and legs bitten during the (main) course of the film though. These alligators are a hungry lot, devouring looters who take advantage of the hurricane and generally snapping off any tidbit put close to their snouts.The action begins when competitive swimmer Haley (Kaya Scodelario) becomes worried about her father (Barry Pepper) when she can't contact him and heads directly into a hurricane. No one is suggesting nuking this one but a shock-jock warns against discharging shotguns into it. Finding her father trapped in a crawl space under a house they soon come under attack from the gators. Truly disturbing scenes of gators pursuing them in confined spaces becoming even more terrifying when the house is inundated by water and the creatures are in their natural element. Even in the open, gators converge to frenzy feed on people in flooded streets.Some great editing (by Elliot Greenberg) and cinematography (by Maxime Alexandre) provides plenty of shocks and suspense. Nothing supernatural no weird monsters, no aliens, just the existential terror of facing a natural predator when the conditions favour them. Director Alexandre Aja has delivered a horror film to rival his epic The Hills Have Eyes. 8.5/10.",Crawl

71,TdSmth5,Straightforward and effective creature horror.,8,3 November 2019,"Aja returns to maritime creature horror with Crawl, a somewhat minimalist but effective horror movie.Haley is a competitive swimmer in Florida. After training she gets a call from her sister asking her to look after their dad who lives in the area now that a strong hurricane is approaching. There are road closures and evacuations but Haley goes into the direction of the storm anyway. First to the dad's apartment where she finds his dog but no one else. Then she drives to their old family house. The dad's car is there but he's nowhere to be found. The dog also indicates he is there so Haley has to look everywhere, eventually making it into the...and I'm not sure what this is supposed to be... something in between a cellar and a crawlspace. Too tall to be a crawlspace and to short to be a cellar. In any case, it's starting to flood, but Haley doesn't really have to crawl, ducking is enough. There she runs into an alligator. Eventually she finds her dad unconscious and with a large shoulder wound. She tries to yank her dad to safety but has to make it back. The alligator won't let her. So for now they have to stay there in this area where they can crawl but alligators can't (?).She tries to alert 3 thieves out in a gas station in front of the house with her lamp. But the alligators have plans on their own for these three. The dad wakes up and tries to help Haley find a way out. The stairs are not an option because there isn't just one alligator, but two now, and the water keeps raising. There is a drain pipe from the swamps (into their crawlspace?) but that's where the alligators came from. Their only option is a trapdoor somewhere that leads upstairs. Haley manages to find it but there's stuff on top of the door so it won't open.There's no other option than the drain pipe then and the three make it into their house after first trying to get into the car (?) and then into some tiny boat and after sustaining plenty of injuries. By now the levees break and as soon as the make it into the house so does everything else--water, trees, alligators. Now they have to make it to the roof. In the meantime some rescue crew arrives but they too have to deal with the gators. The only thing left to do is to try and make it to the roof.Crawl is as short movie, it's got likeable and believable characters in also a believable relationship who have to overcome these life-threatening challenges. Production all around is very good, from the creature effects to the weather, to the sound production. The movie is creepy and has a couple of good scares as well. Scodelario and Pepper offer solid performances. There's not much to complain really. Of course things stretch belief, and it would have been nice to have some more characters, more violence, more gore, some nudity, and some sunshine at the beginning and end. We do learn something about this family's past but in spite of that, the relationship between the father and daughter is well-portrayed and not too dysfunctional. Crawl just works in every aspect and is strong horror movie.",Crawl

That top predator crap doesn't help.Did you think the last ""Lake Placid"" episode from the eponymous franchise was downright worthless, stupid and nonsensical (like I did)? Well, let me put your mind at ease. Despite some laughable facts, this reptile-horror ""Crawl"" isn't bad at all. You can even call it exciting at times. And compared to ""Lake Placide"", the bite-sized animals are frequently in the picture and the CGI ensures that they look frighteningly realistic. You just have to use the same ritual as with ""Hobbs & Shaw"". Namely, give your brain for safekeeping when entering the movie theater. It's not of the same absurd level as ""Sharknado"", but if you don't do that, you will be annoyed about multiple idiocies.There are of course many ""How stupid can you be?""-moments. For example. You can't blame the day-trippers in ""Jaws"". They were just enjoying the summer sun on the beach and the refreshing water. Did they know that this giant white shark was planning to consume a few splashing bathers? It's a pity they ended up as lunch. But, you can't say the same about Haley (Kaya Scodelario), who, after a disappointing swimming performance, comes up with the grandiose idea to see if everything is okay with her father Dave (Barry Pepper). Nothing earth-shattering, were it not for her to enter a restricted area controlled by the authorities because of a destructive hurricane of category 5. Even a roadblock by the local police didn't stop her.The advantage of ""Crawl"" is the short playing time (87 minutes). Nowadays it's perfectly normal for decent films to exceed the 2-hour limit. It seems that quality nowadays depends on the total duration of a film. Fortunately, there are exceptions to that rule. Not that ""Crawl"" is of high quality, but an advantage is they don't spend too much time to bring the necessary suspense. After around 20 minutes, Haley and her father are already in a difficult situation in the basement of the parental home. Dave is badly injured. And three giant alligators are impatiently waiting for their feeding-time. Time for the second ""How stupid can you be?"" moment. What would you do if you had to leave your safe hiding place to recover a lost item? In any case, after getting hold of the trinket, I would return to that safe place again. Logical reasoning is certainly not Haley's strongest characteristic. She does the opposite, with all its consequences.""Let's not make it too complicated!"". That's what the creators of ""Crawl"" thought apparently. Everything takes place at one claustrophobic location. And the entire film is carried by just two main characters. Occasionally, a few additional characters appear. But their function is limited to playing live fish food. In other words, they usually do not remain intact for long. And for the lessons ""Logical reasoning"", these good-for-nothings didn't get high grades either. And the way in which they involved the alligators in the story is also simple. A hurricane that causes rising water and you are stuck with a whole swarm of those bloodthirsty monsters in your backyard. Only the discovery that Haley made in the basement wasn't 100% correct in my opinion. Coincidentally there was a pregnant alligator who used the flood to shamelessly dump her eggs in Dave's basement at lightning speed. Well, in this way there was also an explanation for the aggressive attitude of the nest of primitive reptiles.There were a few things in the movie that really annoyed me. First, there was the contrived and corny father-daughter relationship. They are both sitting there with torn limbs and shattered bones, and still, they need to philosophize about what went wrong in the past. I also thought it was a bit unbelievable how they endured the brutal attacks (with the necessary injuries) and apparently afterward had absolutely no problems with this. Even after a heart massage and mouth-to-mouth breathing, one jumps back into action in a short time. And I will never bet my money on a swimming competition between an alligator and a trained swimmer. I'm sure that the streamlined body of the reptile will ensure that it wins effortlessly. Even without a swim cap and aerodynamic Speedo swimming trunks. But still, ""Crawl"" is a nerve-racking horror in which the perfectly computer-generated alligators scare you. Most original in the film I found the bathroom scene. Believe me, after this film, hearing the song ""See you later Alligator"" by Bill Haley will scare the hell out of you.More reviews here: movie-freak.be",Crawl
73,aidanratesmovies,Could have been better...,5,23 November 2019,"Crawl may manage to provoke some frightening scenes and tension without, but the film is fundamentally flawed as a film itself, lacking a true compelling story or anything to care about other than not getting eaten. Kaya Scodelario makes for a good performance, or at least a decent one in a crowd of shotty ones. Her delivery of the lines, in a script which dialogue is undeniably filler, is what truly makes her better than the rest. The film does start out entertaining, but tends to drag as the situation seems to get sillier and sillier to fill runtime. The CGI varies from decent to obvious, and the direction makes the film seem slightly more impressive than it is. In the end, Crawl proves to have an interesting concept, and at times can be exciting, but there's nothing quite else that makes it truly remarkable, or for that matter, truly enjoyable. It gets caught in its own trap of simply not knowing where to head with its own material, and at times becomes frustratingly dull.
My Rating: 6/10",Crawl
74,questl-18592,CRAWLspace,3,14 January 2020,"You know what can really hurt your alligator movie? When the gators look like poorly rendered demon lizards.Crawl is a B list horror movie if there ever was one. Cheap looking effects, from the gators to the environments. Mediocre acting, get bitten by a gator and then swim around in SALT water, well as long as you seethe once it's ok. Get a chunk ripped out? Just yell once and it's all good.What really kills me are the physics. The things that these gators can and can't do make no sense. They can bust through a house, but they can't get through one piece of glass? And anyone that's ever watched the Crocodile Hunter knows how much they love to do the death roll thing. I know these are gators and not crocs but come on, they just bite down and then do nothing so often. Also, who dumped the gator pheromones in the water there? Cause they just keep coming!This has a fun concept though. Getting trapped in a crawl space in a Florida hurricane with a gator? That could be fun. This is not that. It does have potential to be a fun, so-bad-it's-good movie but don't mistake, this is a bad movie.",Crawl
75,truemythmedia,WATCH OUT!,6,3 October 2019,"The film really doesn't aspire to be anything more than what it is at face value: a creature feature/ survival flick. While from a scary perspective, there weren't really any moments that had me holding my breath, the film was competently made enough that I honestly would recommend it if you came across it on a rainy Saturday afternoon. It's certainly not the best movie I've seen in the genre, but it's far from the worst; it's a pretty decent thrill ride with some pretty gory kills, and at an hour and twenty five minutes, it's not like it demands much from the viewer.",Crawl
76,a_chinn,"Suspenseful, but would have been better without CGI gators",7,15 August 2021,"I'm not sure I'd have been all that excited about another nature-gone-wild film about killer alligators during a hurricane, except that this one was directed by Alexandre Aja, who helped usher in the French new wave of extreme horror with ""High Tension"" and then came to Hollywood to make some solid horror flicks, including the remake of ""The Hills Have Eyes"" and the surprisingly good ""Piranha 3D."" The story here follows a woman going into the center of a storm to help her father (Barry Pepper). She and her dad then find themselves trapped in a house that's quickly flooding and now infested with alligators. They're not radioactive, or 40-feet long, or mutated. They are regular ol' gator just looking for food, which helps the film with some of its credibility. It also helps that the film keeps it small and suspenseful. Almost the entire film is takes place within the flooding house and Aja builds suspense wonderfully. Aja creates a scenario where the audience can't help but think to themselves ""What would I do in this situation?"" and for the most part the characters act intelligently and make reasonable choices you would do in the same circumstances, which also helps to make this horror film more effective and draw the audience in. What hurts the film the most is the CGI alligators, which are distracting and take you out of the reality of a slowing flooding house in the middle of a category-5 hurricane. I'd have preferred a few animatronic alligators that are shown less on screen, ALA ""Jaws"" or ""Alien,"" which would have felt more realistic and also more frightening. I recently rewatched the originally ""Jurassic Park"" and had the same feeling about the dinosaurs. The Stan Winston designed practical dinosaurs the actors could touch and interact with were far more compelling than the computer animated ones. But this is an old sticking point for me. CGI is only good when you don't notice it and it's unfortunately very noticeable here, but despite that, ""Crawl"" is nonetheless an enjoyable scary horror flick that's well worth watching. FUN FACT! Out of all the movies that were released in 2019, Quentin Tarantino has selected this one as his favorite.",Crawl

78,Reviews_of_the_Dead,Fun Creature Feature,8,21 July 2019,"This was a film that I was intrigued to check out, because the premise is great. I'm down for creature features, especially ones with alligators or crocodiles, since they're just so scary of animals to begin with and how they get trapped in this crawlspace, I was in. The synopsis of this is a young woman, while attempting to save her father during a category 5 hurricane, finds herself trapped in a flooding house and must fight for her life against alligators.We start this off at a swim practice at the University of Florida in Gainesville. Our main character is Haley (Kaya Scodelario). She loses her leg of a relay and she is upset with herself. In the background we see looming are some dark clouds and in the locker room we see that a hurricane is on its way. Haley has some missed calls from her sister, Beth (Morfydd Clark) and they connect for a video chat. It appears the hurricane is changing course and is now supposed to hit them. Beth asks if Haley has spoken with their father and she states she hadn't. Haley gets the idea to go check on him since he won't respond.Haley first heads to his condo he is staying in and he's not there. Their dog is though and she knows something isn't right. She then heads to where the old house, but on the way she is stopped by Wayne (Ross Anderson). They know each other from back in the day and he tells her she can't go in. She ignores him and takes a different route. When she gets there, she sees her father's truck.She goes inside and there's no sign of him. She searches around and hears a radio. She goes down into the crawlspace and finally finds him. His name is Dave (Barry Pepper) and he's out cold. There's also a bite wound on his shoulder. She tries to drag him out and she finds out what attacked him, an alligator. It chases her and her father back into section where pipes are blocking it off enough.Dave does wake up and they have to figure out how they're going to get out of here. The problem becomes that the hurricane hits and water is starting to fill up the crawlspace. There's more than just one alligator down here and it becomes a fight for survival.Now I have to say, I had a lot of fun with this film. This is definitely a popcorn flick, but it does have some heart to it as well. This family is broken up. Haley went off to college and her parents divorced. This actually has kept her away from seeing her father. We also get the sense she kind of blames herself for them splitting up. Beth has moved to Boston and her mother is in Europe, so Haley has isolated herself.Going farther from that though, Dave doesn't want to let go. He came out to the old house to try to seal off some pipes to ensure the house isn't completely destroyed. There are pictures out in his condo of his family and how they're not really around. The film does address that he doesn't want to give up the house with all of its memories, so I think that is part of it.I've already touched on this a bit as well, but I do like that this film is grounded in reality. Alligators are something that looks similar to a dinosaur. Even more than that, they are efficient killing machines. I like that they are just normal animals that are hunting for prey. There is a reveal in the film that addresses why they're being more aggressive here and it does make a lot of sense. I also love that the tension is building as the crawlspace floods. It is quite realistic as this could really happen. There is also a looming threat that the levies could break as well.Speaking of building tension, I think this film did a good job there. We definitely get the type of film where we have out of the frying pan into the fire. They try different ways to get out and they are foiled at different steps. I like that the film never really hits a lull because of this and just moves at a good pace through everything. It has a low running time which also helps in my opinion. I like how the film ends as well.To move next to the acting of the film, which I thought was good as well. Scodelario is someone I've seen in a few things, but didn't realize it. I like that we can see she is dealing with things and that could be affecting her in her swimming. I like that she needs to address these issues in order to survive. She also isn't bad to look at. Pepper is really good as well. I'm just a big fan of him and I thought he fit into this role very well. He is there to encourage Haley, even if she doesn't realize she needs it. Clark is solid to start the ball rolling to get Haley where she is and I thought she was fine there. The rest of the cast rounds out the film as well for what is needed.Something I was concerned with coming in are the effects. I knew that the alligators were going to be CGI and I can't fault the film there. To be honest though, I thought they did a good job with them. There were a couple of moments that I could tell, but for the most part I thought they looked and moved like the real thing. I even like they incorporated how these animals try to kill their prey. The wounds and blood looked good. There is a bone scene that made me cringe as well. The film was also shot very well, especially the underwater scenes.Now with that said, this film was a lot of fun. It is definitely more of a popcorn movie, but there is a bit of heart in there as well. I love the idea of how they get trapped and the creatures that are hunting them. It is paced well; it never gets bored to a satisfying conclusion in my opinion. The acting really helps this film as well, as I thought both stars really give depth to the characters. The effects have a lot of CGI, but they did good with it. The soundtrack really didn't stand out, but it doesn't hurt the film either. I did like that we hear people and things around them that drive the tension and the story. I would say that this is a good film and one of the better alligator films I've seen.",Crawl

It's a brilliant horror creature feature. The cgi is totally realistic. The alligator attacks are dazzling and numerous. You'll jump out of the edge of your seat at least 15 times.

80,burlesonjesse5,VIEWS ON FILM review of Crawl,7,17 July 2019,"A giant hurricane hits South Florida and a young college swimmer drives there to save her downtrodden dad. Here's the problem: Said dad is trapped in the basement of his house and there's a bunch of evil alligators salivating down there. That's the gist of the white-knuckled yet predictable and farcical, Crawl.Crawl, with its mounds of apprehension, its B-movie nastiness, its crunchy sound editing, and its heroine implausibility (only the game leads survive this feeding frenzy), is one of your more serviceable Jaws genre-d ripoffs. Better than Lake Placid, less gory than Piranha 3D (same director), more chilling than The Meg, and Citizen Kane compared to 2011's Shark Night, Crawl is an ideal summer movie even if the foreseen outcome is there for the taking.Crawl is produced by Sam Raimi and directed by Alexandre Aja. It has an undeveloped script that shadows the action and gators that get the formidable CGI treatment (it's still all good). Despite your typical thriller flaws here, Aja knows how to build tension, knows how to release it, knows how to shoot low to the ground, and knows how to make you fearfully squirm.In truth, Crawl is so wet, ratty, and slimy you can almost feel your feet itch from your waterlogged shoes. I wouldn't say ""run"" to see Crawl but its stomach-in-your-throat ardor is at least worth the price of admission.Crawl stars Barry Pepper and Kaya Scodelario as the father and daughter in peril. They have palatable screen presence, they look like they could be related, and they give decent performances. However, their wounds throughout Crawl are about as non-fatal as Thomas M. Gifford after a fishing accident (Kaya's persona should have lost about three limbs by the 60-minute mark). Add Aja's whiz-bang camera movement with his crocs slithering like they were in a Activision video game and Crawl barely gets a 3 star rating.",Crawl
81,Kamurai25,"Crawl, if you have to, but check this out.",8,22 June 2020,"Great watch, will watch again, and can recommend for horror fans: surprisingly, I think slasher fans would like this more than creature feature fans.PSA: Alligators are a real and dangerous threat to human life, when provoked. Please, if given the opportunity, do not provoke Alligators or Crocodiles (they're more aggressive.Warning: If you were affected by hurricane flooding (e.g. Katrina), then, this might trigger you, a lot.Apex predator: The top hunting animal in its region that kills prey with (little or) no competition. Humans are only considered apex predators because we use advanced tools, and then sometimes we still die.Actual review:
It is really great to go into a movie with no expectations and have a pay off like this. I didn't even realize that Kaya Scodelario was in this, let alone carrying the movie (alligators get partial credit).The way Haley has to hide and evade the alligators is clever and the threat intensity is way up: it makes for a pretty good suspense movie. This style is more like slasher or paranormal movies where the killer is playing with the prey it is hunting. The movie also abuses alligator ambush hunting techniques to facility some jump scares.The production quality is amazing in this: all the water work, and I honestly had trouble telling when alligators were CG or when they were practical (most of the time). They honestly tried to give the audience a vividly detailed experience, to include injuries, but they did play fast and loose with the damage they sustained.I liked this movie a lot, but there were quite a few problems with it. I HATED the dad character, and (granted it was a badly written character) I don't think he was portrayed very well. Honestly that entire b-plot was worthless, it didn't do anything but break the tension they worked so hard to build. Her being a swimmer (established early), really didn't have anything to do with anything.There are several point where they sustained injuries incorrectly, or used those injured limbs to do things that wouldn't have been physically possible (literally would have snapped it). I'm less concerned with the bad physics (shower door), or sound effects, and mostly upset with the research done on alligator behavior.I happen to know a bit about gators / crocs, and people in Florida who deal with them (even a nuisance) will know too. These alligators are overly energetic, and crowded (they normally only gather to bask). These gators tend to hunt like wolves in water, rather than the curious prehistoric monsters they are.Alligators will investigate (sometimes with their mouth), and upon finding a meaty bit will pull towards water, and deathroll. It is not just a finisher, its one of 3 things they do (bite, tail sweep, and roll), and they'll do it when they feel desperate too. They point of it is to either drown the prey or break / rip bits off. 9 / 10 times (on a good day) someone is dead when a gator gets them, because whatever it bit is going with the gator.So while there are some problems, if you just want to shut your brain off and be scared of some monsters for a bit, then this is an excellent choice.",Crawl

Nearly 45 years after the shark movie changed how animal attack movies were made, this new one from the director of Don't Breathe and produced by the man behind the Grudge reboot and of course the original Spider-Man trilogy Sam Raimi fits the bill pretty well. Kaya Scodelario makes her big debut in this film as a young college student from the University of Florida Gators (get it? Gator, Florida) who lives with her single Dad (Barry Pepper) at a home in Florida when a major hurricane hits the coast just like in real life with Barry arriving this weekend as of this review.

But what injured him in the first place is what forces them into a battle of survival as they try to escape before the house & whole town floods in the wild storm!I found the film to be really enjoyable. I knew I would like it anyway, but it was actually pretty good! The kills are epic, the scares are on point & the suspence is immense! The blood & gore didn't disappoint either!

This goes from dumb to dumber to dumbest on a matter of minutes.

86,fntstcplnt,Crawl (2019),5,19 April 2020,"Directed by Alexandre Aja. Starring Kaya Scodelario, Barry Pepper, Jose Palma, Morfydd Clark. (R)Florida swimmer Scodelario and her injured father (Pepper) are trapped in a crawl space as a hurricane bears down on them, terrorized by a congregation of alligators--that's what a group of alligators is called, which is probably more research than the filmmakers did when it came to the toothy reptiles, but what should be expected? After all, director Aja previously made piranhas do things that piranhas don't do (""Piranha 3D""), mutant cannibals do things that mutant cannibals don't do (""The Hills Have Eyes""), and mirrors do things that mirrors don't do (""Mirrors""). The performers do valiant work even while devoting most of their dialogue to unpacking family baggage and being soaking wet throughout filming; the attack scenes are a little closer to silly than scary, but kinda fun when not overly preposterous (and a lot of fun when very preposterous). The CGI, however, is so much moist rubber that it's genuinely surprising that Arnold Schwarzenegger never shows up to make luggage out of them. Similarly, the script is so corny, it's genuinely surprising that when the heroine gets her hands on a two-way radio, the voice on the other end doesn't belong to one of the gators (what a sly prankster!).

88,arungeorge13,"An entertaining B-movie you want, an entertaining B-movie you get! [+58%]",6,28 September 2019,"Alexandre Aja's filmography (The Hills Have Eyes remake, Mirrors, Piranha 3D, Horns) is quite an interesting one. First of all, they're all not films you'd rate more than five or six stars primarily for their screenplay contrivances (and 'conveniences'). Yet, they've all been entertaining in their own (brutal and frightening) right. Barring Horns, almost all his films have had a run-time of 100-110 minutes or less. His films have a certain kind of audience - what we often refer to as B-movie fanatics.Crawl is also a film that falls into the (B-movie) category: stringent budget, 90-95 run-time, and a screenplay that focuses more on thrills than character development. Yet, two things work in favor of it - Aja's direction (retaining high levels of 'survival-suspense' throughout) and Maxime Alexandre's cinematography (wonderfully captures the disastrous scenery). The screenplay by Michael & Shawn Rasmussen tries to focus on the father-daughter dynamic between Haley (an effective Kaya Scodelario) and Dave (Barry Pepper, who's clearly having some B-movie fun) and it only works in parts thanks to the largely 'meh' dialogue exchanges between the two.For a B-movie, the visual effects are quite compelling. The creatures look vicious and the kills unsparing. Yet, one never gets to understand how the brutes work. We are told that they can see in the dark and a few other relevant tidbits but the screenplay progresses conveniently in terms of how/when they choose to attack. Since the proceedings play out at such a rapid pace, one doesn't get a lot of time to ponder over the logic of certain scenes. The dog, Sugar, was a real cute addition to the film and I was pretty concerned about him surviving the events (watch the film to find out!).At the end of the day, Crawl (weird title for a film about killer gators) manages to entertain and therein lies its recommending factor. It may not win over critics or much of the mainstream audience, but if you know what to expect from a B-movie, Crawl gets its act going pretty early with stunning hurricane imagery followed by alligators out man-hunting.Verdict: Good fun while it lasts!",Crawl
89,Abdulxoxo,Nice little thriller,7,16 January 2021,"In a film like this suspension of belief is expected but there are a lots of places that our protagonist should probably have died many times over; or at least lost some limbs. There are also a number of conveniences, like people showing up or doing something just at the right time to allow something else to happen. But given the low budget, the alligators look realistic enough, which is great. I also thought kaya Scodelario and Barry Pepper gave really good performances. The race against time element of the rising water, coupled with the gory horror of the alligators, is somewhat formulaic, but it works. Despite their lives being in danger for the vast majority of the film, there is quite a consistent amount of laughs.

However that became easier said than done as she unexpectedly fighting for survival as alligators are loose and together they must fight to survive.The effects for the alligators makes them look like the animals they do as they spread terror during the storm leading to a deadly game of survival.Kaya and Barry play well together when you have a small cast you can allow for character development as you see them glow during the movie.The music is helpful as it helps the tone of the plot as you jump as the story continues.The movie has some issues as i know this is just a movie and not meant to be a documentary on alligators but some of the scenes feel unbelievable and unrealistic as alligators are dangerous animals.Also some stunts just don't seem to work as well as they should.However that shouldn't limit

95,blott2319-1,"Ridiculous and campy, but not in the right way",4,6 July 2020,"I'm not sure exactly how campy and ridiculous the director wanted Crawl to be, but they might have overshot the mark. It is loaded with problems, and there were a number of times I was laughing at something I'm sure was not intended to be comedic. Most vicious animal attack movies do their best to emulate the genius of Jaws (and always fall short.) But it seems like Crawl was made to emulate Deep Blue Sea (and still managed to fall short.) Don't get me wrong, there's still some fun to be had with this type of movie, and it's far better than one of those Sharknado films. I found the character stuff somewhat compelling, even if you can see where they are going with all of it. From the first scene you're just waiting for the main character to out-swim an alligator, and rest assured you won't be disappointed with the way the movie handles that aspect.Perhaps if I were to watch Crawl again and let go of my logical reasoning, I could have a blast. It is nice and short, and it almost delivers like a solid B-movie about monsters. I referenced Deep Blue Sea and that's a movie I have been able to enjoy in the past because it is so goofy and fun. I think the difference lies in the fact that I felt Crawl was trying to take itself more seriously, so I was assessing the quality of the story as if it was a serious film. It simply can't stand up to that kind of scrutiny. The behavior of the alligators is utterly ridiculous, and often way too convenient for the heroes of the story. There were a number of times it felt like I was supposed to be scared that the alligators could strike at any moment, but I could sense when it would happen because the music and certain elements of the story would tip me off.Kaya Scodelario does decent work with the lead role in Crawl. I found her endearing, and most of the time her fear and tension felt genuine. I've never been a huge fan of Barry Pepper, but he's not bad as the father of our hero. Their moments of emotional breakthrough feel cliche and not all that heart-warming, but they were necessary to give the illusion that this movie was about more than just people being torn apart by gators. One of my biggest problems with Crawl, and I don't think I can blame the actors (because this is more of a director issue,) is that the characters seemed to recover too quickly from devastating wounds. The idea that they could move around with such adeptness after nearly having their limbs ripped off is ludicrous. It's as if there are no muscles, ligaments, or major arteries damaged as long as the limb remains attached. Again, I suspect those who enjoyed Crawl found the ability to ignore the lack of logic in it, but I couldn't get myself there.",Crawl

103,RforFilm,"Crawl makes for a quick, but fun Jaws-like thriller with alligators. Sometimes thats all you need",9,17 July 2019,"I was at a classic screening of Jaws where the theater was full and people cheered when the shark was blown up. For a movie that's over forty years old, it remains one of the greatest blockbusters despite having a simple premise. In fact, if we take in Moby Dick in as well, it seems that the man vs. beast storylines have been popular for a long time. I think it's because not only do we like to be reminded how fragile people can be, but how much we love seeing ourselves taking on typical animals and making them out to be monsters.When you really think about it, there are a lot of animals that can kill us. We've seen killer sharks, bears, bees, wolves, birds, whales, dogs, cats, and even regular insects. In the case of today's movie, we've even seen killer alligators. Given I live in California, I rarely see those, and even then, it's usually at the zoo. That doesn't mean that I'm aware of their presence in in southeast, especially in Florida. I can see them as menacing, given how the look almost dinosaur-like. Let's see what producer Sam Rami can do with this in Crawl.A college-aged swimmer Haley (played by Kaya Scodelario) gets an alert about a category 5 hurricane about the strike the Tampa area of Florida. She also gets a call from her sister that their dad hasn't been heard from and cannot into contact. Worried, Haley drives into the direction the storm is coming into to get her dad. Upon arriving at his apartment, it's empty except for his dog. She then goes to the old family home that's about to be sold. She arrives to find his car and phone, but still no sign of where he is.She goes into the basement and finally finds him (played by Barry Pepper) injured with bite marks. It's not long when large alligators are discovered and are hungry. She loses her phone and tries to think of a way for her and her father to get out. On top of that, the hurricane arrives with lots of rain. With the floodwater creeping into the basement, they figure they have less then an hour before they drown. It's a battle against two forms of nature as Haley needs really push through, even though she takes a bite or two from the gators.Though Sam Rami didn't direct Crawl, you can see his influence as not only is it an effectively scary concept, but this makes for a fun sit in a movie theater (along with the fact that it isn't too long at ninety minutes). I would put this in the same category as Jaws in terms of entertainment. Is it as smart as Jaws? No, but the purpose of Crawl is to simply give us a quick story of survival and it does it well. Much of comes that little explanation is given to the alligators hunger other then nature. No genetic modification or lab experiment gone wrong; just abnormally larger alligators.It helps too that both Kaya Scodelario and Barry Pepper make for a likable father-daughter pair. You get the sense while there is some tension between the two, its put aside to focus on their survival. This is the kind of story that I'm sure a lot of filmmakers would have been tempted to go into more detail. Something like that would have been called for in a novel, but Crawl understands that simple is best in thrillers. That isn't to say that parts of their past isn't explored, but it manages to feel natural then forced exposition.Shall we talk more about the gators? This is another instance where I would put the movie into the same category as Jaws. We see these animals more then we saw the shark in the latter, but thanks to some good special effects (a mix of practical and CGI), they come off as convincing and even scary. We tend to forget that nature itself can be terrifying. Alligators have gone after people before. Hurricanes can drown people. An extra explanation on why it's all going on would have been an insult.I'll give this nine alligator signs out of ten. Crawl is exactly the kind of summer movie I want to see more of: original, quick, and fun. It's refreshing to see something like this which can come off as old fashioned, but welcoming. We need these kinds of thrillers against the superhero sequel remake-filled schedules. This makes for a fun bite.",Crawl

Simple watch this film and see for yourself.Not scary, no real suspended, silly story with a premise his was written on the back of a stamp but all I'm going to say is the name of this film, Crawl.I predicted why this was called Crawl even before the obvious and impossible happened (no spoilers, but I'll give you a clue its got to do with swimming).Suspend facts, grab a bag of crisis, popcorn or whatever you munch and just enjoy this film for what it is, a film where you don't have to think at all.Aligators are great and look very realistic.Rating 5 out of 10",Crawl
109,bob-the-movie-man,A snappy summer hit: but it should have been much better,5,8 September 2019,"As a bit of summer fun, ""Crawl"" is a real B-movie... but with a decent premise at its heart.But who came up with that title? It's been out for a few weeks before I got to see it last night. But for that whole period I have been cheerfully mis-calling it ""Chomp!"". This is a far more satisfactory title. Ladybirds crawl! Beetles crawl! Alligators chomp!For this is a tale of those creepy, ice-cold reptiles. Haley (Kaya Scodelario) - usefully a leading college-swimmer - is called by her older sister Beth (Morfydd Clark) concerned that she's been unable to reach her Dad (Barry Pepper). He lives in the Florida Everglades and a category 5 hurricane is moving in. Haley goes against the tide of evacuees to reach her old family home looking for her Dad and his dog (mangy cute canine alert).... but finds more than just him there!With nature advancing in multiple forms, will the father, daughter and dog all weather the storm?There's a nice idea at the heart of this film. In the same way that sharks creep a lot of people out with their unblinking cold eyes - making ""Jaws"" such a hit - so lots of people - me included - get freaked out by alligators. If you've been to the Everglades, as I have, there is something totally unnerving about the size and (normal) stillness of these monsters from a prehistoric age. A ""Jaws with 'gators"" had the potential to be a fun summer hit.It's also a good move for the scriptwriters (Michael and Shawn Rasmussen) to put the action in the heart of a hurricane. How else could you strand two people in the middle of a civilised area? (You imagine the writers going through the same mental exercise as the army geeks in ""Close Encounters""). But it's the most inconsistent Cat 5 in meteorological history. I've heard people tell of riding out a big storm at home: that they can't hear each other speak, and that's within the four walls of the house. Here (in an obviously studio-dressed set) the storm barely registers for 60% of the running time: there are moments when you could hear a pin drop! And although the ""fan machine rental"" store next to the studio lot must have been empty, even in the external scenes I've seen stronger winds on Bournemouth sea front.Once we get into the basement of the house, things get pleasantly claustrophobic, keeping (at least initially) the tension high.What exactly is the deal with these gators? WIth the T-rex in ""Jurassic Park"", the deal was pretty clearly spelled out and stuck to: they could only see movement, so stay still and you'd be OK. In this flick, the rules of engagement are far from clear. There is a speech by Dave about them being able to see you, even in the dark... but I was never clear whether they could see you, still or otherwise, and whether they responded to noise or not. And the rules seem to be flexible throughout the film: at one point the duo stay stock still as 'gators swim right past them; in others they stay still (and OUT of the water) yet the gators suddenly launch up at them. Make your mind up!Unfortunately, while the story has potential, the dialogue is truly awful. You know you're in trouble when the lead actress is explaining the backstory aloud to a dog! ""Jaws"" has a brilliant and personal back-story of a misunderstood sheriff battling the greed of local businessmen against common-sense. Here, the writers clearly feel the need to add some family-based angst into the story, but the lines between Haley and dad Dave are SHOCKINGLY bad. And they are spouted at the most inappropriate points in the action! It's actually laughable, and not in a good way. At times I literally had my head in my hands.As a B-movie with a limited budget, the cast is small and made up largely of unknowns. Barry Pepper (sniper Private Jackson in ""Saving Private Ryan"") is the best-known name of the cast. Unfortunately, having to emote the lines he's contracted to say in this movie doesn't help his CV.Kaya Scodelario - who was in the ""Maze Runner"" films and was the love interest in the last ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" flick - suffers the same fate but fares slightly better. She strikes a good action heroine pose, and is one of the better things in the film.Directed by Alexandre Aja (""Piranha 3D"") this is a sub-90 minute film that at least doesn't outstay its welcome. It's been a decent summer hit for the studios (at the time of writing it has made $75 million on a meagre $13 budget).It's certainly not for the faint-hearted in its gore. It delivers a lot of chomping, with the action getting progressively more ludicrous, reminiscent of the ""flesh-wound"" scene in ""Monty Python and the Holy Grail""!. Some jump scares work well. But I can' t say its a great film, because it's really not. In the hands of a Spielberg, this might have really had legs (...to chomp on, LoL). It's CERTAINLY no ""Jaws"". It's not even a ""Deep Blue Sea"". But it's mildly entertaining nonetheless.(For the full graphical review, please check out One Mann's Movies on the interweb or Facebook. Thanks.).",Crawl

When realised that CRAWL was produced by the cult favorite Sam Raimi ( the creator of the three originals EVIL DEAD and the best three SPIDERMAN) and directed for one the best (but underappreciated ) young horror director's Alexander Aja (the creator of HIGH TENSION, The HILLS HAS EYES remake, PIRANHA 3D and a few other jewels) I pretty much run to the theater and even when the story did not look with much potential , but it became an unbelievable pleasant surprise. One of those movies you cannot keep your eyes out of the screen.
Haley (member of a Florida university swimming team and on crisis in her life), receives a call from her sister living in Boston that cannot contact their father in Florida and there is a huge hurricane coming.
Haley drives to his father's home and find him almost dead on house basement badly hurt for a few starving alligators.
From that moment on, the storm gets worse, the alligators number increase and escaping from the basement becomes extremely difficult; particularly when the flood reach that part of the town and hungry beast are hunting on the streets.
CRAWL is both and horror and an adventure movie. Escaping is not easy and requires very quick thinking and physical skills. Both Haley and her father has to work together under very difficult conditions to get out alive.
Aja is an expert exploiting cliches to generate terrifying situations. The main heroine is barefoot (the basement floor is crowded by rats) there is very sweet dog that could become food for alligators too a few disturbing moments that make you scare even when nothing is happening.
The movie works almost perfect; the only discrepancy could be how little damage the alligators made to Haley when they bite her (compare with her father suffer a lot more).

112,kuarinofu,Boomer will live,5,30 September 2019,"I appreciated Crawl for what it was. A well-made suspenseful thriller about surviving a storm while being attacked by the most bloodthirsty alligators you can imagine. It surely is utterly unrealistic both in the portrayal of gators and human ability to survive, but for a b-movie it was fine.I had two major complaints about this movie though and if these were addressed the movie would've been much better. Firstly, the movie should've started much earlier into the story, this time should've been used to set up more characters and show the slowly beginning storm, which is very important in disaster movies - the build-up (instead they just throw you right into the storm). Secondly, and this is interconnected with the first one, if the movie would've started earlier, it wouldn't have to completely go off the rails when they started running out of the script.It was very obvious at some point, the movie should've ended right there, but they didn't have enough scenes for the full feature and so they just threw in more alligators. It gets absolutely ridiculous at some point, gators burst through buildings and they mean business when it comes to some fresh sweet meat (which is so far from reality as far as alligator attacks go, but it's fine).Overall, I wasn't disappointed since most of the movie was effective and suspenseful, but as it started to drag and just went completely insane with the scenes I kinda gave up caring. The ""family"" stuff was ok while being totally misplaced at times.At least it allowed me to use the ""Boomer will live"" meme.",Crawl

With no advance publicity whatsoever because it had most likely been intended as a tax loss write-off right from the start!Boy! Was I wrong.From the moment Ami sees the first alligator, while trying to drag her dad to safety, I was jumping in my seat, yelping in shock, and then laughing in a combination of relief and self-deprecating embarrassment, like I have not done since I first saw the original JAWS in 1975. In other words?As summer-time B-movies go, this one earns a B+.I mean, let's face it. As Canadian/Serbian co-productions go, the English dubbing of some of the actors was just about as sophiscated as the computerized animation behind the gators. Almost undetectably so! After a while, however, the plot-twisting close calls that prevented Ami and her dad from escaping on their own became needlessly redundant.

116,anselmdaniel,A tense crowd pleaser,7,5 February 2020,"This review contains spoilers.Crawl is a disaster thriller movie that premiered in July 2019. The movie is directed by Alexandre Aja. The story is written by Michael Rasmussen, and Shawn Rasmussen. The movie stars Kaya Scodelario, and Barry Pepper. A category five hurricane barrels towards Florida and a college-level swimmer returns home to find her father. During her visit, the swimmer, named Haley Keller, becomes entangled in surviving crocodiles that have infested a home. Dave Keller, Haley's father, must work with her daughter to escape the house that is becoming submerged.Crawl is a personal tale that focuses entirely on Haley Keller. Almost the entire movie focuses entirely on Kaya Scodelario's character. We follow her as she finds the news that her father might be trapped and her journey into the flooding home. The movie keeps the tension up as the flooding gets worse in the house. Kaya Scodelario and Barry Pepper give good performances as the leading roles in this movie. There are many scenes where these two share a dramatic moment as they get past their differences to deal with the alligator problem.The monsters in this movie are the alligators. There are multiple alligators that terrorize the main characters and kill the looters in the area. These alligators are portrayed as incredibly brutal as they behave like animals that tear apart its prey. The movie uses computer-generated imagery for these alligators and after the initial viewing of the alligators they become more fluid. The opening shots of the alligators in the basement did not look good but as they became more obscured and started to blend in with the environment they look better. The actors do a good job reacting to the monsters well.There is not much of a story in Crawl. The movie is incredibly basic in its story as Haley only wants to rescue her father and not much else. I watched the movie for its basic story and I was pleased with the result. Anyone expecting more from the movie should look elsewhere.I would recommend 'Crawl'.Grade: C",Crawl

Most blockbusters have resonated with me, and they've been my favorite films to watch so far (Avengers: Endgame, John Wick: Chapter 3 - Parabellum, Us, Glass). Additionally, original low-budget flicks have also caught my eye, and I've been enjoying them as well, even if they're no masterpieces (Greta, Long Shot). Although, I had some bad experiences as well (Dark Phoenix, Hellboy, Godzilla: King of the Monsters).Crawl, which I honestly expected just to be a cliche-filled silly horror movie, joins this last group, and it's on par with Long Shot as the best surprise of 2019, until now. First of all, this is not a typical horror film, at least having in mind the last few examples of the genre. People might go in expecting something along the lines of Annabelle Comes Home, but with alligators, so I might as well moderate those thoughts. I wouldn't even place it in that genre, even though disaster-horror isn't exactly a bad description. It's definitely a suspense movie, almost like a survival-thriller. Haley and Dave have to fight for their lives in a race against both a hurricane and fatal predators, so I wouldn't generally put this in the horror genre. Moving on ...I love this type of films, you know that. Suspenseful, claustrophobic sequences, straightforward plot, and set in (mostly) just one location. You might think that since it's only one place to shoot and it's such a simple concept, it's easier overall, but it couldn't be more distant from the truth. With high-budget, multiple-location movies, directors and screenwriters can hide their technical flaws with tremendous VFX or huge set pieces. In one location, especially such a small one like a modest house, there's no hiding. If you want to deliver an entertaining and captivating story, you have to write an enthralling screenplay. If you want to provide scary and efficient jump scare scenes, you need to show some creativity and prove you're a talented filmmaker.Alexandre Aja, who doesn't exactly has a remarkable filmography, showcases that even with such a simplistic and short idea, it's possible to be as or more fun than a massive blockbuster. Less than 20 minutes into the film, and we're on. There's enough backstory and characterization of the main protagonist for the audience to not only care about Haley but understand what skills she has that will help her survive what comes next. I love small details like zooming in on her locking a door, closing a window, moving a piece of furniture ... Every shot has meaning because it will affect the plot later on. Aja is not shooting something ""just because"", and that's a skill that a lot of directors struggle to have nowadays since they feel that the runtime needs to be close to the two-hour mark.After so many dumb, cliche, and horribly performed jump scare sequences in previous horror flicks from this year, I finally got to watch a movie where the director knows how to truly scare people, and make them jump out of their chairs. There are no loud soundtrack noises to make you screech. There are no demons or monsters in front of the screen, screaming like crazy. I was at the edge of my seat for more than a couple of times, and I genuinely got scared on some particular moments, where the surprise factor (Aja doesn't follow the cheap timings of most horror scenes) and the creativity behind the camera were top notch.Obviously, the VFX and overall production design aren't mind-blowing. The alligators look pretty real, and that was the main goal, so mission accomplished. Also, being Rated-R helps the film to deliver great alligator attacks with tons of blood, and the injuries our characters have to deal with are pretty gnarly and disgusting (that's a compliment). Filming in water is extremely hard, especially in such a confined space. However, Aja and his crew were able to produce a movie where you can understand everything that's going on for the entire runtime.Kaya Scodelario and Barry Pepper deliver great performances and show amazing chemistry. Their characters have enough development, even if they don't have that imaginative scripts. Crawl is one of those films where I can't point out a preeminent issue with it because it's good at every aspect. I mean, sure, there are a couple of rare moments of extreme survival, where we might think ""he/she should be dead"", but it's such a fun and entertaining time at the theater that we can let go of one or two over-the-top scenes. It's not like The Meg, where every single moment is unrealistic as hell. The success of the fictional part of a fiction movie depends on its realistic foundation and limits. If these aren't well-established, then the film will be all over the place, and its viewers won't know what to believe or not.All in all, Crawl is one of 2019's best surprises, and I definitely recommend to see it in theaters. With compelling leads and a simple concept, Alexandre Aja delivers an entertaining, suspenseful, claustrophobic, and technically creative movie. Finally, someone who knows how to handle a camera, and provide genuinely scary jump scare sequences. Hopefully, this can catapult Kaya Scodelario to grab a bigger role on a more impactful film. I can't point out any ""flaws"", it's simply a ""good movie"". With such a low-budget, give a chance to this one, and watch it instead of a massive blockbuster that will probably leave you disappointed with the numerous cliches and the extreme focus on silly action or huge set pieces as a replacement for a good story. Good job, Paramount!",Crawl
119,SoumikBanerjee25,Surprisingly Well!,8,27 November 2019,"An Excellent execution with tighter screenplay alongside some memorable performances ; I must say this one surprised me a lot! Carrying along a 'Monster Movie' tag it never succumbed to uncertainty or took it self lightly! Every situation felt like a real danger and the performances made those believable too! This movie took itself more seriously unlike many other Creature movies and I'm genuinely glad for that! Although there are obviously some flaws, Like Haley's character who's been bitten, thrown apart, injured badly by the alligators but her portrayal, progression of the character didn't really carry those wounds in the latter stages! Some injuries seemed too serious to be ignored but there she was with all strength and fury like nothing ever happened! On the other hand the Father character was more believable and grounded on the sense of agony and excruciating pain he might have suffered from the life threatening injuries! Kudos to Mr. Pepper for playing the role efficiently. The technical sides too didn't disappoint me at all! The CGI, Sound Design and the Visuals all looked great considering the limited budget allocation of course! The plot hovers around the survival of the two leads and tries to build upon the relationship between the father and the daughter! I really liked that touch though I was expecting much more depth from it! At least we are getting something right? so be it! the only con I had was the ending! The first 1 hour was so captivating, the ending kind of messes it up a little. Having said that it wasn't bad but not what I was wishing for! In the end It's a movie that totally surprised me for the standard it showed and the seriousness it endeavoured! I totally recommend it.",Crawl
120,RussHog,Useless,2,2 April 2020,This film has a dumb story and an even worst plot. CGI crocodiles look terrible. It's impossible for a croc bite the lady's arm but she can escape unhurt. It's a very weak use of a character arc. Actor Barry Pepper is as worthless as ever. The lead actress is horrible. Women cannot save us from global warming. Or crocodiles.,Crawl

122,meydiana-65242,Nice acting with lots of strategies,10,18 October 2020,This is a very memorable film although it is thrilling and we'll made. Once the conflict begins you are on the edge of your seat with worry for the protagonists it is when they waste screen time with unnecessary dialogue that have nothing to do with the dangers at hand the movie appears campy.I did enjoy the performances of the small cast and of course the gators. It's a pretty fun filled movie so give it a shot.,Crawl
123,cardsrock,It's more Anaconda than Jaws...,4,19 July 2019,"I'll give Crawl credit, it doesn't try to be anything more than what it knows it is. Unfortunately, it isn't self-aware enough to really have any fun with this premise. It plays it pretty straight and comes across as SyFy channel-like. There is a short stretch when the gators first appear that there are some decent scares, but the movie takes a bad turn and the protagonists become even dumber.",Crawl

125,jmbovan-47-160173,Small but strong film,7,11 April 2020,"Upon a second watch of this film, I was surprised as to how quickly it moves to ""trapped by alligators"" as I thought there was more plotting to it. But, I was wrong. The plotting is in the fight for survival and the relationship between a daughter and her father. Had me rooting for them, and cheer when an alligator gets its comeuppance. I enjoyed the aspect of the characters finding their inner strength as well as the strength in their connection.",Crawl
126,Azanspy,I had a lot of fun.,6,20 January 2020,"Crawl is nostalgia. It reminds us of the old survival movies with predators which we had a lot of fun. Crawl makes us gasp and thrilled for all of its short run time. Kaya Scodelario did a good job in the leading role. The visual effects were decent and acceptable if we reduce our expectations as it's a low budget movie. But I think the allegators could have been better and more realistic. Overall, Crawl is a watchable movie for people who likes these sort of films and they can have so much fun.",Crawl
127,dilipbts,Crawl,8,10 July 2020,"I saw this in a theatre with my pal. Had high hopes with names like Aja, Raimi n Ghost House Pictures. The film is fast paced with sufficient kills. Only problem is the lack of character development of the extras. The last good crocodile film I revisited was Rogue n that film had some character development regarding the extras (fellas who get killed off) but in this film, extras r jus killed left right n cente, while our lead pair of father n daughter keeps hanging around in their basement with wounds. One of the best part about this film is the cinematography especially the constant rain n wind. Lots of crocodiles with vicious kills. Tension is maintained with a solid background music. Morgan Freeman's Hard Rain n Bait 3D came to mind while viewing this.",Crawl
128,sbweightman,Good and achieves what it sets out to do.,7,25 August 2019,"Predictable and clear in where it got its inspiration from, but enjoyably entertaining nonetheless. It has a few good moments which make you jump and a semi-realistic storm depiction which, although doesn't quite add to the tension, like the alligators, it does keep up the impending threat. The story and acting are ok and the ending sort of fizzles out, but it achieves what it sets out to be in a good way.",Crawl

130,danielmanson,I annoyingly enjoyed this more than I should,6,8 May 2021,"Well, well, well I actually quite liked this. I'll be honest I had absolutely no expectations and actually expected it to be one of them silly, over the top films. And it wasn't!Do not get me wrong. This film has plot holes and flaws. But I think in order to watch this, you have got to not expect some insane, in depth plot. It's man eating crocs for god sake. Just take it for what it is!Some things that did bother me. The main people seemed to be made of steel and when a 10292837 foot long croc bites your arm I'd assume that arm would come off. I'd also assume you can't our swim it, but here we are.On a more serious note, I thought the plot was ok, they did well with what they had. I did feel that it lost momentum towards the back end of the film and all the plot holes etc start bugging me more and more. The acting was ok, there's really not much else to say about that. I thought it did a good job of illustrating the claustrophobia being in the crawl space. It had a few jump scares in there, but nothing too drastic and the intensity and intenseness was also good.There was a couple of down moments in the film, they talk about the parents divorce whilst stood in the same space as giant crocs. Read the room, it changes the intensity of the film and loses the audience. Nobody cares and it doesn't add to anything. They did this a couple of times and it didn't work at all.Overall it ain't a bad watch in my opinion, it's a bit of fun in the end!",Crawl

133,FrenchEddieFelson,Stressful and entertaining at will,6,26 July 2019,"Despite 3 or 4 irritating scenes that transpire script mediocrity with let's say 1 or 2 appalling minutes, the film manages to scare the audience with panache, at least me anyway. I was indeed gesticulating in my armchair each time an alligator grabbed and shook a protagonist. Actually, it's not really surprising: as an euphemism, in the horror / thriller genre, Alexandre Aja is definitely not a padawan. Thus, Alexandre Aja has managed an effective film that successfully fulfills his objective: to keep the audience on the edge of the seat during 90 minutes.",Crawl
134,PyroSikTh,Lake Placid for the 21st Century,7,18 September 2020,"It's Jaws, but with Alligators! So really, I guess it's more like Lake Placid for the 21st century. Haley hasn't spoken to her dad in a long while after they fell out, but with a category five hurricane heading for their Florida home, and her dad not answering his phone, she takes it upon herself to go and evacuate him herself. Problem is, he's stuck in a crawlspace under the house, pinned down by alligators looking for a quick meal. This would be a problem as it is, but of course, there's the category five hurricane to contend with as well, which steadily floods the neighbourhood over the film's lean ninety minutes. That's it. That's the whole movie. It's just an hour and a half of watching Haley and her dad make stupid decisions as they attempt to escape being fast food and/or avoid drowning under their old family home. And it was great!Okay, so first thing's first, this isn't exactly high art. It's not meant to be. It's a creature feature, and creature features have always been a bit stupid. Every advancement over the years in animal behaviourology never matters for these films. No, alligators will not all congregate together in a single neighbourhood during a hurricane to eat the human inhabitants. But then without that there's no movie. Sometimes you've just got to kick back and accept that these are horror movie monsters dressed as alligators. Or I guess you could just laugh at how grossly inaccurate these movies are and still get an ironic form of enjoyment out of the movie. Either way it achieved exactly what it aimed to do; entertain. That's all this movie is and ever will be. And that's good. We need more movies that are just good, solid entertainment, without having to worry about being realistic, or being true to source material. Just a simple premise with some simple thrills for a simply good, vapid time on the sofa.But what about the stupid decisions the characters constantly make? Yeah, that can be annoying. I admit, it would be nice to see a horror movie like this where the characters actually make half decent decisions for once. Then again, they're injured, stressed out, and terrified for their lives. Short of depicting them in a full on panic, stupid decisions are exactly what us humans would make under such pressure. Yes, sitting out in the open to make a phonecall is stupid, but once you've got your hand on what you believe will be your ticket out of here, sometimes we can be a bit hasty. What about them attempting to make a break for the boat instead of climbing their house in the first place? Well they were desperate to leave. It's not the best decision, but it has validity. What if the water was sure to rise beyond the roof? Or if rescue helicopters were hours away? Getting out sure seems like a damn good decision to me. They just timed it wrong. Why Haley couldn't swim ahead to get the boat and bring it back for her injured father is another story though.And on that matter, I can accept stupid decisions, and I can accept unusually aggressive Alligators that hunt more like the Velociraptors in Jurassic Park, but the degree of injury in this film was a bit silly. Numerous people get completely torn to shreds from these alligators, but Haley and her dad have a superhuman resistance to them. The dad has a leg so broken that the bone sticks out at a right angle, but he can walk around relatively fine later on. Haley gets dragged underwater and spun around, but she manages to come out with her leg still attached. The dad's arm gets bitten off, but there's barely any blood loss. Both characters get bitten in the shoulders and arms, but can still move and use those limbs just fine as if their flesh hadn't just been rend down to the bone. And don't get me started on Haley's Aquaman level of swimming proficiency. I don't care how big and lumbersome alligators look, in water they can swim more than twice the speed of the world's fastest human swimmer.The visual effects are also a bit of a mixed bag. The alligators themselves look absolutely amazing. Behaviour aside, they at least look super convincing as real animals. The way they move, both on land and in water, was super realistic. The attention to detail with their gutteral growls and hisses as well was great. These are the best fake alligators I think I've probably seen in a movie. However, the outside scenes seemed a little off. It's quite clear they were on a pretty tight budget for this movie, filming most the action on soundstages or in water tanks, with the most obviously artificial lighting and over-dramatic CGI sky behind them. And yet I can't bring myself to say that it looked particularly bad. It gave the same atmosphere as the sun setting underneath dark, overcast clouds, where the sun behind you is bright and an unnatural hue, while the sky in front of you is dark and foreboding. That is what this movie looked like in almost all the outside scenes. Unnatural, but not bad.I got exactly what I wanted out of Crawl. It's a surface-level movie all about thrills, many of which were quite cheap. Kaya Scodelario and Barry Pepper were definitely engaging enough as Haley and her dad (and it was nice to actually see them both in something again), the alligators looked amazing, the crawlspace was super claustrophobic at times, and the pressure of the hurricane added an extra layer of tension as the clock kept ticking and the water kept rising. This was never going to reach people's top ten lists (unless it's a list of top ten alligator movies, I guess), but it never wanted to be. This is exactly the kind of movie that I feel deserves to be judged on its own merits. It still wasn't a super amazing creature feature, but it was a decent one worth watching if that's your kind of thing. I enjoyed it, and I would recommend it to anyone who's interested. If you're not interested, you're predisposed to not like it already. I give it an entertainingly imperfect 7/10.",Crawl
135,ebeckstr-1,Never judge a movie by its trailer,5,29 July 2020,"In the hands of a better screenwriter Crawl could have been an entertaining suspense/action movie. As it is, it is marred by too many poor exchanges of dialogue, too many moments in which characters speaking out loud to themselves to telegraph obvious information to the audience, or to convey information in a manner which flies in the face of one of the most basic, tenants of filmmaking: show, don't tell. A couple of such moments are annoying, but an accumulation of them reflects poor writing.Also reflecting this lame writing are plot weaknesses. More than once, the two main characters sit around in the middle of a hurricane, a flash flood, and killer alligators, talking about their relationship problems for minutes on end. No one would do this in real life under those circumstances. Even acknowledging that this is a mere popcorn movie, it's just stupid character behavior, and it's really hard to root for characters behaving stupidly.It's a shame, because this must have been a hard shoot for the cast and other personnel, given that most of the movie takes place in water. From a technical standpoint, despite some moments of mediocre CG, the movie does have its strengths, but it's just not enough to save it from the weak writing.",Crawl

138,sweidman-28016,The Summer Horror Movie We Need,7,7 August 2019,"Crawl Review:Crawl is directed by Alexandre Aja, his most popular movie being The Hills Have Eyes (2006), and is produced by Sam Raimi. It follows a swimmer named Hailey. While attempting to save her father during a category 5 hurricane, she finds herself trapped in a flooding house and must fight for her life against alligators. I remember seeing the trailer once and people thought it was a somewhat big deal since Sam Raimi produced this. I like his Spider-Man movies (excluding Spider-Man 3) and the work he's done with his horror films in the past, especially the classic Evil Dead films. I watched the trailer and I thought it looked pretty dumb. To me I thought it had a similar feel to Hurricane Heist. If you've never heard of it don't worry, you're not missing much. But it looked like it would be a horribly CGI movie with a bunch of jump scares and not much of a plot. One day I was scrolling through Rotten Tomatoes and I noticed that Crawl was at a pretty good score, but not only that. It was also certified fresh. At the moment I decided I should probably see it. Working at the theater, nobody seemed to ever go to it. When I went for a 9:00 show I was the only one there. To my surprise this actually wasn't a terrible movie like I thought it would be. It was entertaining to watch. In my opinion it's the kind of summer horror movie we need right now: nothing great but fun and entertaining. Horror movies are becoming so complex now, I'm not saying it's a bad thing, so it was nice to watch a simple, straightforward, entertaining movie. The plot is pretty predictable. It's something we've all kind of seen before, following cliches and the setup of an average monster/creature movie. The only difference, instead of sharks and piranhas, we now have alligators. The story quicks off right away with the hurricane. We get a little bit with Kaya Scodelario character, which she did good. She's a swimmer and is starting to realize she's not the best swimmer anymore. Some of the exposition isn't really needed. I liked how her dad, played by Barry Pepper who also did well, pushed her to use some of the swimming skills she learned when younger to push her to keep them alive. How she outruns some alligators in scenes and staying underwater for long periods of time is kind of unrealistic but it made for some suspenseful scenes. I wasn't a big fan of how they ended suspense with jump scares most of the time. It was getting a little annoying. Some of them made sense, for an example characters are going to jump if a tree falls during a hurricane. But seeing a alligator doesn't need a loud sound with it. Just put it on the screen. I wouldn't say this movie is really scary. The only ""scary"" parts were the very loud jump scares. Surprisingly the movie was pretty gory. The effects for weren't bad either for both the gore and hurricane effects. Overall it's a pretty straightforward horror movie. It's nothing great but entertaining. I'm sure some would be surprised with what they did for the 90 minute runtime. There's always something happening so you can't say it's boring. The one thing I will leave this review with is this whole movie could've been avoided had the been smart and not have a basement in a swamp in Florida.My Grade: B-",Crawl

It's somewhat fun, but it'll never compare to the Jaws movies, unless they start building real ones again. CGI can never compare. Not only that, but the minimal story here doesn't do much either.

140,ethanbresnett,One of the better creature features I've seen,7,19 July 2021,"Crawl does exactly what you could want from a film like this, which is to build terrific amount of tension and get you invested in the main characters.Pretty much from the outset a gloomy and tense atmosphere is created as our protagonist sets off towards a hurricane in search of her father. From this point on the tension is pretty non-stop, cultivated by a great use of sound, cramped spaces, terrific acting, and neat camera work. From start to finish your eyes will be glued to the screen not wanting to miss a single frame.I thought it was a brilliant idea to keep the character list short. Additional cast members were added in to remind us of the danger posed by the gators (not that we needed much of a reminder), but for the most part we focus on Haley and her father, which allows us to build a connection with them and truly root for them. As a pair of protagonists they were well developed and felt quite real and authentic.Another point in favour of this film is that is didn't make the mistake of being overly long. At a crisp 90 minutes it manages to get the job done without lingering on any aspect for too long.Despite all its brilliance, Crawl still wasn't able to avoid a few genre pitfalls and cliches but these never detracted from the enjoyment of the experience.Much better than I expected considering the premise is very basic, but they managed to extract every ounce of tension, drama, and excitement from this premise resulting in a very enjoyable and atmospheric movie.",Crawl

A good, scary film, with quite a bit of suspense and terror! A dad and daughter are caught under their house in a hurricane, with some very hungry alligators! Freaky stuff that made me tense and jumpy! I thought Kaya Scodelario did a wonderful job as the daughter and presented a dang strong hero figure! The movie is fast paced and pressure filled!

143,nikola17,it will crawl right in your edge of your SEAT !,10,22 July 2019,"Just watched this movie last night it was soo great i thought it was fun ride from start to end of film it's no build up or anything like that it's fast forward on going survival horror creature film i haven't never seen a alligator film since lake placed that was pretty good film i enjoyed that was last alligator film because their isn't much movies of alligators, there are some pretty nice practical effects utilized throughout. The CGI on the Alligators is good, but sometimes (in the beginning of the film) looks shaky as well but it doesn't put me out of movie at all. the film is similar to the shark movie Bait (2012) but expect this is a lot better and better film then to bait because that was in supermarket and this film has take the idea out that but movie has taken it to different direction. the story and characters were fantastic, the only characters are main is only 2 of them is Haley (Kaya Scodelario) known for 5th Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales, Maze runner movie franchise. she plays a swimmer and she did it since a kid she wants to go and see her dad but she got a lot of guts and balls because her friend said turn back but she rejected what her friend ignores the evacuation in order to search her father, Dave But that's not the only problem. The problem is the Killer alligator as they became trapped by the rapidly encroaching floodwaters. was back at home that direction was bad storm weather father Dave (Barry Pepper)known for Saving Private Ryan, knockaround guys, broken city, snitch many more he is been in movies and shows. them 2 i love them as characters i loved how Dave was so support to Haley he motives her about her passion, they talk about their lifes in past and script is well written and the characters were well developed. Even the Dog had your heart strings tugging. the trailer of film shows everything in movie so that's why people you should never watch trailers nowadays with so many spoilers alert in it, in trailer that's how much they show in this movie is in trailer and it felt like you seen the entire all movie of it, people just read storyline or see movie blind without seeing the trailer that what ruined it for people. There are a few ""jumpscares"", but they aren't dialed up to 11 like any another horror movies like for explame conjuring or Annabelle movies, It's not a long-winded movie. It shocks you to the bone.People seriously complain about everything these days....horror movies are not ""realistic"" enough...blah blah blah. It's a MOVIE! A FICTIONAL MOVIE! this isn't like Black Water (2007 film) Australian film, this is a fiction film witch is pretty cool to see unrealistic things in it. horror director's Alexander Aja (the creator of HIGH TENSION, The HILLS HAS EYES remake, PIRANHA 3D also sam rami written this movie as well witch fantastic it won't make a difference if he directed movie or Alexander does i won't mind if they both directed movie that would great, because sam rami is a true horror film director known for evil dead films. i liked this more then don't breathe because he written that movie as well, but this what he written is a lot better. it's a very short fast pacing lean meat film running time is 83 minutes long. people hated this because movie is too short, too quickly well people that's how much the story is written it's not going to be a build up like jaws give it a break here because they want more ? i am like what is their more to it ? this is highly recommended film of all time go and see it your missing out !",Crawl

145,Just-A-Girl-14,Ridiculously unrealistic but still entertaining,7,4 January 2021,"Crawl is a movie about a father and daughter who are trapped in an alligator-infested crawl space of a Florida home during a Category 5 hurricane. It's a combination of my favorite movie genres: horror and disaster/survival movies so I was expecting to really like it. The problem with this movie is that it is so unrealistic that it's more ridiculous than scary. It's still a fun watch due to its fast pacing, good acting and decent CGI but you don't have to be an expert to know none of it is even close to being real. The alligators are way too big, both father and daughter suffer some serious injuries that at minimum would cause them to be unable to move (if not die), people cannot swim faster than alligators (you can call yourself a predator as much as you like but it's just a fact), helicopters do not fly in a Category 5 hurricane and I'm not a Florida resident but I'm pretty sure they are more prepared for hurricanes than this.
Also, the dialogue is not great. If an alligator is about to eat you alive maybe you can save the sentimental childhood memories for hmm... later?!
I still enjoyed the movie, there was never any dull moment and it's fun as long as you don't take it too seriously.

149,stevenrotherforth,Who you calling a B movie?,8,21 December 2019,"CrawlCreature features are ten a penny.
They can be found lurking on the Syfy Channel. In the bargain bin of your local DVD store and available to stream on the internet.
A good Creature feature, one that can be respected as being a well made piece of entertainment is something of a rarity.
Crawl is one such film.
A B movie with Blockbuster aspirations.
This is mainly down to the execution of a simple yet effective premise.
One portrayed on screen with masterful direction and by two excellent lead performances.
Crawl tells the story of a young woman named Haley played by Kaya Scodelario.
After receiving no answer from her father and with a category five hurricane imminent. Despite the local sheriff disallowing Haley she decides to go to see if her dad is safe.
Her father played by Barry Pepper is found unconscious in the basement with the storm raging outside.
Soon it becomes apparent that their family home has some new inhabitants in the form of two angry alligators.
Trapped in the large basement and with the risk of flooding becoming dangerously close. The father and daughter must fight for survival against the two apex predators.Like all good B movies the plot is simple.
But as aforementioned it is executed expertly.
Kaya Scodelario gives a heroic yet convincing performance. One that can be likened to Blake Lively in 'The Shallows'.
But unlike that film 'Crawl' has a much more believable ending.
The film manages to remain grounded and conceivable except the way in which the two lead characters deal with massive injuries.
The father loses his arm to a hungry alligator and deals with the problem rather casually.
I would be immobilised if I'd stubbed my toe on the coffee table. Not this guy.
Haley is shook around several times like a rag doll but seems to substain no threatening injuries.
Putting this aside the film is a supremely nail biting experience.
Director Alexandre Aja cranks up the tension with precision having the audience balancing on the end of their seat.
For a film with a production budget of 13.5 million dollars the CGI gators are very realistic.
Set design is also superb as the two humans try to escape their flooding home.
On Blu-ray 'Crawl' looks and sounds very good.
A film that outshines its modest budget in all areas.
If you are a fan of this genre then 'Crawl' is definitely for you.
This is a B movie treat that is worth revisiting again and again. Something that cannot be said for some movies made for ten times as much.",Crawl
150,TwistedContent,A Top Notch Creature Feature,7,26 September 2019,"Finally had the chance to see ""Crawl"", no thanks to the cancellation of its release where I live, still a mystery nobody has been able to explain to me. Anyways, Alexandre Aja has delivered once again.I want to say right away that ""Crawl"" is not big on plot - the story archs, characters, themes etc. are extremely familiar, the predictability factor is pretty high & those are pretty much the reasons why I didn't give it more than a 7, but, make no mistake, it's an awesome creature horror, the kind that comes around once in a few years. We're here for the blood, gators and action & we got it, a satisfying amount of everything wrapped up in a beautiful cinematography, very creative camera work & actually top tier cgi. And the kills are all enjoyable. The looks are ""Crawls"" strong suit & also, I'm happy to say, acting is as well. I've always low-key been a fan of Barry Pepper, but it was actually Kaya Scodelario who surprised me, giving a great lead performance as the survivalist of this gatorcalypse. Unfortunately, the ending slightly bummed me out, but that's in relation to the aforementioned plot flaws.""Crawl"" is probably the best top tier animal horror since ""The Shallows"" & it makes me happy that it did reasonably well at the box office. Here's to hoping that Hollywood do more of these! My rating: 7/10.",Crawl

152,ericrnolan,"A very short review of ""Crawl"" (2019)",8,24 July 2019,"""Crawl"" (2019) is an often corny creature feature that still delivers the scares quite nicely, given its decent creature effects and its successful mashup of man-vs.-nature plots. (Our father and daughter protagonists here must face off not only against the movie's reptilian horrors, but also against the hurricane that conspires to aid the lizards' hunt.) Our heroes are portrayed by the terrific Barry Pepper and Kaya Scodelario, both of whom are better than the script's forced and clunky family drama.But the real stars here are the alligator-related catastrophes that we bought a ticket to see, and those are inventive and fun. The movie feels like a particularly creative 10-year-old playing with his toy alligators in his sister's dollhouse - but I mean that in a good way. It totally works. I jumped a couple of times, and that's a pretty good sign that a horror movie is working.I'd rate ""Crawl"" an 8 out of 10, and I'd cheerfully recommend it to someone looking for a decent new summer monster movie.",Crawl
153,DeBBss,"Good Concept, Alright Execution",6,23 May 2020,"It's hard nowadays to make something original from a monster flick, and Crawl attempts exactly that, but something doesn't feel right about the movie. Crawl follows everything you need to follow if you're going to make a monster/horror movie, and because of that, it creates a lack of charisma. Everything is very average in Crawl, and when they try to explore on certain themes, it just doesn't seem to work. Claustrophobia is a major theme in the movie, but it never felt claustrophobic to me. I know Crawl is a movie that's supposed to be taken lightly, and I tried to lower my suspension of disbelief, but they got too many things wrong for me to criticize it.Alligators are cool animals, and I can see why they picked alligators for this movie, but they got so many things wrong about alligators. I'm okay with changing an animal's characteristics for a movie if it's done moderately, but they changed almost everything about alligators. This lack of realism makes everything seem cheesy, and it makes the writers look stupid, even if they know what they're doing isn't realistic. Although I hate how they've portrayed the alligators, I do like some concepts of the movie. Being trapped inside your home is a theme that is always used in horrors; Crawl uses this theme very well and realistically. Beside from that, everything was just average.The acting in Crawl really confuses me, because at times, it's great, but at other times it's not. I really can't fault the actors too much, because most of their roles were supporting characters, not leading characters. When it comes to the characters alone, it doesn't get any better. We get some cheesy flashbacks and corny lines for some exposition of the father-daughter relationship, which is the worst way to give characters exposition in my opinion. They also tried to include a lot of character development, which is very reasonable, due to the circumstances of the situation in the film, but it doesn't feel deserving. They had the formula for everything to be good, but for some reason, it all falls flat; maybe it's just me.Last thing I want to mention are the cliches in Crawl. When it comes to cliches in horrors, you really can't blame them too much, because the genre itself is a giant cliche. All I want from Crawl is be more discreet in these cliches. You know that the main characters are going to survive everything somehow no matter what, and that's because of Crawl's cliches. If a film is too saturated with cliches, then the film becomes predictable, and you never want a plot that is predictable if it's a horror movie.Crawl isn't a bad film, and I like how they're trying to do something new. The execution just wasn't performed well, so it took this concept and made it average in almost every aspect. Crawl suffers not only from the terrible execution, but also from its cliched plot that makes the movie very predictable. Crawl is a movie where you have to turn your brain off to watch, because if you don't, there's a lot to criticize.",Crawl
154,TheHoodOfSwords,Fun Animal Thriller,7,19 June 2020,"Almost super great! Like I almost loved it and thought it was pretty good, but there are a lot of good things and bad things. I enjoyed the tension and atmosphere of the film, Sam Raimi knows what he's doing as a producer on this and a lot of it feels quite polished in terms of the setting. The characters were likeable enough, the movie does definitely follow the cliches of most horror type movies, disaster, a character makes a ballsy play, characters have long talk about past and life and reconcile, characters get injured etc. So it's not like this movie feels overly different from the rest in its genre. Still, I liked the setting and you really do feel quite a bit of tension and claustrophobia in this movie.Now onto something I felt conflicted about, the Alligators and their CGI. When the alligators are swimming around or attacking people they look great! I mean it, they really look like ferocious beasts. However, any time the gators are out of the water and are walking it looks well... bad. The first time I saw one of the alligators I kind of winced. The location is in a muddy wet spot, but the alligator's feet don't interact with the environment. So it kind of just looks like it's walking without touching the ground.Another thing I didn't like is the injuries. The characters in this film suffer a lot of injuries but they never seem to affect them later on in the film. The Dad of Hayley literally has a broken leg where the bone is sticking out of his leg and he is able to walk around and such throughout the film. Hayley gets her arm bit on hard by the gator but once again it doesn't seem to really affect anything in the movie?Overall Crawl is a satisfactory horror thriller movie that will make you never want to go to Florida, but don't expect there to be all that much to bite down on towards the end of the movie.",Crawl

director: Alexandre Aja
starring: Kaya scodelario and Barry pepper etcoverall rating 90/100when failing swimmer Hayley ( Kaya scodelario) cant find her dad when there is worst storm she has ever seen she must find him and when she does survive an army of killer alligators in what can be described as jaws but with crocodiles. This film pleasantly surprised me. It knew exactly what it was and for that it was a incredibly tense,clever and well acted thriller/horror lets talk more in depth about this.First of all i have to start off with the great acting. Bary Pepper was excellent here, He really did a fantastic job of acting in extreme amounts of pain which made his performance more believable. Also his character showed a good amount of vulnerability which made you like his character even more. And i had mixed feeling about kaya scodelarios performance at first, as for me her performance lacked passion and it felt generic for me therefore i did not connect to her character at first. However as soon as it got to the second half of the film her performance got better and bette. She showed versatility with her vulnerability of feeling like she split her parents up but also showed heart and lack of fear, And she really sold her injuries as well so she more then made up for the first half of the film.Next the film had a incredibly tense tone and excellently executed jumpscares. Wow this film did a absolutely incredible job at keeping you tense and on the esge of your seat. This film had a lack of sound so you could tell when a jumpscare was going to happen but this did not make it generic as they made you wait for so long that you did not know when it was going to happen. Definitely some of the best executed jumpscares of the year as it really made me jump on multiple occasions.Next i loved the gore and death. This film was certainly not for the faint of heart. There was incredibly graphic injury detail and deaths. It just made the film so much more entertaining as they did not hold back or play it safe which they easily could of done, they went all out and it really payed off as i was thoroughly entertained throughout the whole entire runtime which was the perfect length.However one thing that annoyed me was the film had a complete lack of logic and some things did not make sense and was not very realistic. Firstly the garage door was left open which obviously would of let water and alligators through. And considering the amount of injuries these two characters got i am surprised they didn't either die or pass out from the pain.Next the film did some clever and interesting things with its plot. I loved how the film was pretty much confines to just one house but they found new ways to find the film entertaining and to keep you interested. they used the space around the house very well as it was not just the basement they used the kitchen well as well as windows cleverly. But the most entertaining use of the house was with the bathroom where the glass in the shower was used very cleverly to trap the alligator.Next i think Kaya scodelarios character had a good character arc. I found her whole arc of feeling like a failure due to always losing at swimming competitions really interesting. Because she had to fight against her head and prove herself wrong by outswimming the alligators and to use her skills in her favour. It was just a nice little arc showing the confidence growing in her character. However the film had no character development whatsoever. It was all very much what you see is what you get. I think this was mostly because the film was quite constricted due to its lack of characters. so it was just two people trying to survive alligator attacks. There was nothing to special about them as people so it wont win any screenplay awards despite it being incredibly suspenseful and entertaining.And finally the film had a good amount of emotional weight and relatable themes. I think Hayley feeling like she was the cause of her parents split and her whole conversation with her dad made the film had a good amount of emotion and reasoning for there distant relationship. And this kind of attitude may hit home with some audience members who are going through the same thing so this was well executed despite not being a huge part of the film.overall despite having a couple of narrative and screenplay flaws. Crawl surprised me at how tense,entertaining and terrifying it was.",Crawl

158,AndyVanScoyoc,I've Seen MUCH Worse...,5,22 April 2021,"I passed this film by, at least a dozen times on Amazon Prime.I can't stand films made about/in/Florida subjects, because most of the time they're made by non-Florida natives (I'm a Native Floridian - here before ALL the theme parks and before the ruined beautiful native habitat - and know life here isn't rose petals and sugar sprinkles) who have no real clue how Florida truly is (they tend to think Disney and magical beaches ARE Florida) and go by just what they hear and see on the news, which only feeds the ridiculous idea that Florida is some kind of tropical paradise.While I'm not expressly impressed by this film, it's not really horrible.Typical stupid decision here and there and a nice twist or two, but it's not too bad.Glad the dog wasn't killed because had it died...for any reason, I'd have SERIOUSLY trashed this film.We get enough of that crap here, people moving down here with ZERO clue how dangerous the waters around here can be and their dogs get snatched and eaten, right off the leash, often...in front of their owners.Could this movie/event happen even in the Everglades?

159,movieman6-413-929510,Stupid but entertaining mix between Lake Placid and Into the Storm.,6,10 July 2019,"Crawl is a new horror thriller directed by Alexandre Aja, the director of The Hills Have Eyes and Piranha 3D.In the film, a huge category 5 hurricane is racing through Florida. Despite the hurricane, Haley Keller (Kaya Scodelario) ignores the evacuation step-by-step plan to find her missing father Dave (Barry Pepper). She finds her father seriously injured in her parental home, where he finds himself in the crawl space to shelter during the hurricane.
Due to the rapidly rising water they both get stuck in the house and now have to find a way out quickly before the hurricane gets worse. Apart from the dangers of the hurricane, the two learn that alligators with the current have also invaded their homes. Dave and Haley must now leave the house before the storm reaches its peak and stay away from the hungry alligators.This film comes across as a mix between the films Jaws and The Day After Tomorrow, but unfortunately Crawl does not really have the quality of these films and looks more like a mix between Lake Placid and Into the Storm. Although this film does not have the quality of films such as Jaws, this film is told in such a serious way. This serious way does not work thanks to the stupid unbelievable way in which the story is told, because the main characters always know how to survive everything even though they have been bitten by an alligator. The characters also make many stupid mistakes, making the situations only dangerous for themselves.
This movie is so entertaining if you don't think too much about the situations or events and just try to enjoy it.The best in the film is the band between the two main characters. Kaya Scodelario and Barry Pepper appear credible as father and daughter. The rest of the cast serve more as extra characters in this film that can be attacked and killed by the alligators.",Crawl

Those also had the restriction of taking place within a big old house.I kept thinking that the young woman would have a great deal of guilt essentially being the indirect cause of the death of the two cops.I've appreciated several films that Alexandre Aja has been a part of beginning with High Tension, The Hills Have Eyes and P2.

A young woman goes to check on her father, only to find her self and him stuck in place, and fighting for their lives.
I loved this movie. The production values are great. A lot of investment went into making these animals look scary, threatening, and realistic. It is shot well, despite often being in very cramped spaces. The acting is very good, and the story doesn't fall short. There are definitely a few clunky conversations, usually to try to ""up"" the emotional value of the characters, or create some kind of emotional attachment to these people and their plight. Those did not always land. However, a father and daughter clumsily trying to tell each other that they love each other is not enough for me not to enjoy an action-packed creature-feature.

Hurricanes and alligators what could go wrong? These types of films can be a bit cheesy so they shouldn't be taken seriously because some do take it too far. Fortunately ""Crawl"" has a fine balance between the realistic and the stupid, all in all it was damn entertaining from start to finish.It has everything you want, good simple premise, likeable characters, not over the top acting, horror, gore/blood/deaths and nail biting tension. Not bad going i'd say.The premise is simple but very effective the audience can understand what is going on straight away. The film mainly focuses on a father and a daughter for the majority of the film, they are just very ordinary people put in a extraordinary situation. They are relatable, likeable and ultimately it makes you root for them to survive, simple but effective writing. Fortunately its solid acting nothing over the top, just what we needed.Lets bundle the horror, gore etc all in one, yes there is some and it is brilliant for one main reason......its not overdone. Instead there are different ways to make the film horrifying other than just showing us blood and gore. (More on that in a bit). It is awful or great, which ever way you look at it, when the alligators attack people because there is build up, which makes all the more impactful. Lastly, my god is there tension in this film especially when they are trapped under in the basement of the house. When the water was still and it was all quite.......my god was it horrifying not knowing where the alligators are.Kaya Scodelario and Barry Pepper are good in the film, as I said not much for them to do other than to look scared and scream when they get bitten. But more importantly they didn't over act because there was a lack of ""meat"" on the bone as for character development. There is an attempt and it sort of works but its not much because of the limited run time, it was probably all we needed really.Now I must also mentioned that although I've already stated that this film is very tense.....it is also extremely claustrophobic, especially when they are trapped under in the basement. I'm personally not claustrophobic but even I was feeling really uncomfortable, which goes to show how great those scenes where filmed. It made the hair on the back of my neck stand up.........really terrifying.Overall it 70% out of 100 or 7 out of 10 its good, I didn't realise this before but my word are alligators terrifying.......I wasn't bothered by them before but I am now....really creepy. ""Jaws"" did it for sharks now ""Crawl"" has done it for alligators.The one thing though that did make me laugh, is the fact that after being bitten/attacked multiple times by alligators it seems that Kaya Scodelario's character can still swim absolutely fine........its the only stupid thing that didn't add up for me.....oh and also the dog survived....how?",Crawl

180,Jared_Andrews,Simple yet Entertaining Monster Movie,6,25 January 2020,"In the ilk of ""Jaws"" homages (and rip offs), ""Crawl"" stands as one of the more palatable entrees.There's nothing spectacular or groundbreaking about this fun summer riff, but that doesn't mean it offers no value. At the very least, we can celebrate the successful effort to make a non-sequel or movie based on preexisting IP. Granted, the threatening water predator vs. humans rose in the wake of the classic shark film, but this gator flick has enough original juice to stand firmly on its own.Part of success comes from simple premise of ""Crawl."" In the opening phase of a Category 5 storm, a young woman, Haley, receives a call from her sister. Sis has been calling their dad and hasn't yet heard from him. She's worried, as he resides in the area slated to take the worst of the storm. Haley opts to brave the weather, make the two-hour trek and check on dear old dad.When she arrives at his place, she finds her severely injured father and something even more concerning. Then she quickly understands why he hasn't picked up the phone.Queue the giant alligators and ensuing chases that take place as Haley and her dad attempt to escape the flooded basement. Fortunately, Haley is a swimmer at the University of Florida, yes, the school with the gator mascot. Her speed and resilience make her a worthy adversary to the collection of gators, and she manages to narrowly avoid death in a string of riveting action scenes.A few meandering moments explore family drama but don't do much more than fill time. These moments feel entirely forced and only serve to hinder the story's momentum.The movie is at its best when it leans into the raw and truly frightening action sequences. Kaya Scoldelario displays a knack for playing a strong woman in peril. The movie doesn't work as well if she isn't so solid in the role of Haley.The movie has no more depth than the shallow basement waters inhabited by the gators, but it's entertaining enough for cursory viewing experience, especially given the brisk 87-minute run time.",Crawl

The SYFY ones are campy in bright daylight with bad CGI.Crawl grabbed the viewers attention as soon as it begins and keeps you on the edge of the seat until the very end.

This movie offers neither; we get 15 minutes of exposition and literally nothing actionable happens until 21min. The CGI, however, is absolutely incredible, especially in the dark and wet crawlspace. Once biting occurs (seen in the trailer, too), you might as well accept that this is a sci-fi movie because the realism textbook goes out the window, and apparently our lead character is Wonder Woman. I do however love Barry Pepper, only I wished he was in it more. There was one massively dumb decision by the main character that really bugged me, and I know it was solely to progress the tension of the plot/scene.

I loved the idea, sharknado-ish, but really well produced and directed.
The tension builds even though there are some ridiculous events, such as Haley (Scodelario) driving off into a cat 5 hurricane without a care in the world to find her father...who is estranged.
Then there was just lots of silly choices as there often is in this kind of movie, and it was bizarre to watch them close to drowning or being eaten in a filthy basement which had the flimsiest of brick vents which would have quite easily been smashed with the shovel they had.
Also, held in a 25 foot alligators jaws and spun around underwater she can still grab the flare...whateverrrr.
But the main thing for me was Scodelario's face. I mean what was she doing? Her facial expressions were appalling for an actress as accomplished as she is, and she was constantly manipulating her lips so that all her teeth showed. If you try to say the things she did with your mouth open you'd feel how ridiculous it is.
However, if you can manage to ignore her, and some of the most stupid scenes seen in any movies, you could indeed enjoy it.

190,RhapsodyReviews,BIG Surprise.,8,7 October 2019,"Review:
'Crawl' is an American survival-horror film directed by Alexandre Aja. This movie had so many things stacked against it from the very start. In todays day of age, not many horror films with animals as the antagonists do very well, both financially and critically. In this cage I strongly believe that the producers of this film, knew what they had when they hired Alexandre Aja as the director ('The Hills Have Eyes'). He did a great job building tension throughout this movie, and it never lets up until the credits roll at the end.
We start the movie right in the middle of a Category 5 hurricane and a young woman named Haley (Kaya Scodelario) goes to make sure her dad (Barry Pepper) is okay after not being able to get in touch with him. After finding him injured in the crawl space of their old family home, she tries to get him out only to find herself being stalked by multiple alligators. With the crawl space filling with water, Haley and her dad must find a way out before they drown or become lunch to the apex predator.
Barry Pepper blew me away in this movie, everything he did felt real and intentional. You believe that this could be a father and daughter fighting for their lives, the chemistry between the two leads is there. Kaya Scodelario on the other hand lets us down, particularly in the beginning of the film. Not to ay she was awful in the movie, but when a film is focused on two characters throughout the entirety of the movie, you need to have the leads be able to play off each other. Instead it feels like Barry Pepper needs to keep the movie afloat when Kaya Scodelario is slowly drowning.
Multiple things in this movie work very well, and some things that may be flawed are only hearsay because it could be said that the characters were packed full of adrenaline. I love that the writers of this movie made the characters smart. They make smart choices in this movie to keep themselves alive for as long as they can. In one scene Barry Peppers character measures how deep the water is while looking at his watch to determine how much time they have before they will be underwater. The thing I thought could have been done better, is when they get hurt in this movie, they seem to be almost back to normal 10 minutes later. As I said we could say they're full of adrenaline, but I'm sure with some of the injuries they endure they wouldn't be running like they do.
Overall, I was very surprised and entertained throughout this movie. If you like survival movies in general, you will like this movie, or if you like predator vs. prey movie you will enjoy it too. I recommend this movie to anybody who likes these types of movies.

Apparently there are alligators walking around there and I guess they don't eat anyone who is knocked out. So it becomes survival as all the other minor characters in the movie bites it.The movie would be rated higher but sometimes characters become really dumb to extend the length of the movie. Not sure why she would want to be loud talking to her dad as she searches out of her hiding space to get a cell phone from the gators. There were many instances where it seems plot armor protects these characters from being eaten. Also the ending is really abrupt.

199,keelhaul-80856,"Not Bad, but could have been a lot better...",6,26 October 2019,"This was an interesting concept, especially when you think about the dangers of Florida and Louisiana lurking around, from gators to spooky swamps, to released pythons and such. The script and characters in this movie are really more of a 2 or 3 rating. I felt the run time was too short, and needed a few more elements or developments to really make this a horror/thriller classic.I really like Barry Pepper in stuff like Saving Private Ryan or Knockaround Guys. He plays a good tough guy or young asshole side character, but I just wasn't really feeling him as a grizzled dad. I never believed he was the character the whole time-- just Barry Pepper stuck in a basement, reading generic dad phrases and featuring in flashbacks. This was a very bizarre choice for the role of dad, in my opinion, but whatever. I kept waiting for him to start reciting the Lord's Prayer in a Southern accent, and blow holes through gators with his rifle, but maybe we can get that in a sequel. Lol.My wife really enjoyed this one, and there is enough action and suspense to allow you to suspend disbelief in places, just enough to enjoy the flick. The cops or emergency workers seem a bit goofy and useless, but I guess it could happen. I think there was even a scene where the girl retrieve's a cop's gun and tries to fire, but it isn't chambered. Huh? What cop doesn't have a bullet chambered on duty? Maybe he wasn't a cop or because of the storm he just didn't rack one, but this seemed odd. It was also very convenient that the gators were sometimes all over everyone and everywhere, attacking like maniacs, and other times, you could just chill with blood on you in the water, and they would vanish or swim past someone.The amount of coincidences are also a bit hammy and silly, such as everyone getting trapped in a basement and then a book shelf falls on the only door out. I wish there had been some other stuff in the film too, other than just the swimmer setup and some lame flashbacks. The first 25 minutes are quite boring to me, and the film is too dark to see what is going on in the opening basement scenes. I guess this is realistic, but it makes it tough to even see what was going on. I figured out there was more than one gator early on, but my wife couldn't even see the action enough to tell. Not nearly enough guns were involved, for people in a rural gator area. I would have killed 2 or 3 gators just for fun, with all the guns most Southern folks keep on hand.Anyway, this is an exciting flick with a few scares and some new ideas, and it will definitely entertain you, though I am a bit sorry I spent money renting it. If my wife hadn't been excited by the premise, I would just wait to see this for free somewhere.",Crawl

203,S_Soma,Nothing good ever came from going into a crawlspace.,7,17 July 2019,"By virtue of a variety of bad choices driven by personality traits such as obstinacy, resignation and concern over an emotionally adrift parent, a father and adult daughter find themselves trapped in the crawlspace of the father's home (the idiot, self-pitying father who should have evacuated along with everyone else) amid rising floodwaters in the teeth of a hurricane. The floodwaters have given an apparent infinite number of murderous crocodiles/alligators (whatever) access to, well, just about everywhere.For the most part, although the premise sounds rather dull, the movie is very exciting and well-made. Excellent production values. And for those that like that sort of thing, CRAWL features a sufficient number of people-being-eaten-alive to satisfy those with ghoulish tastes. MMMMmmmm... Pink and chewy on the outside, crunchy on the inside. Gotta have those more often. (See if you can find the reference. It fits exactly.)There are, however, in my opinion, a handful of stylistic flaws that, while they don't detract too much from the movie, are still fairly annoying on general principle.On numerous occasions the wounded father, with quiet aplomb, is more than happy to send his daughter out to perform various ""challenges"" which almost certainly all but place her within the jaws of some alligator or other. And he doesn't bat an eye. Actual parents NEVER do that. While she is the logical choice to perform these tasks based upon the collection of story-driving circumstances, genuine parents would have to be forcibly restrained at the THOUGHT of putting their kids at risk even once, never mind repeatedly.Rescuers seem to carry almost no armament. In the entire movie I only saw one (what looked like a) 9 mil. The crocodiles are so thick and fast you could probably walk across town on them and not get your feet wet in the floodwaters, but legitimate protection is not in evidence. Crocodiles are not being INVENTED in this one particular hurricane; any time any sort of flooding in this area would occur there would logically be this crocodile ""issue"". Given the crocodile density depicted in this movie, I rather imagine fully automatic bazookas would be general issue for any members of the authorities.The father gets his arm bit clean off but issues forth with only the oochees and ouchees that would be more associated with squeezing a large carbuncle than losing a primary limb. And then the crocodile fight continues unabated. This is not what happens when you lose an arm.At the end, the floodwaters have risen right up to the roof line and there are our intrepid heroes, lying there comfortably on the roof. They have reached home plate and safety at last. Which makes no sense at all because, again, the water has reached right up to the rooflines and is even lapping OVER the roof line on occasion. In other words, all of the roofs are basically forming nice, gradually sloping beaches down to the water. Given the several million crocodiles that are apparently everywhere, there should be an advancing phalanx of crocodiles closing in on our heroes with nowhere to run. But no. Apparently crocodiles honor the niceties of ""Ali Ali oxen free!"" Go figure.On the very positive side, CRAWL does seem to generally avoid the usual horror/monster movie trope of making everybody act like morons as the primary plot vehicle to move the action forward. I mean, apart from the one foam brain who insists on slowly wading out in waist deep water apparently possessed of coma-inducing curiosity as to what is causing a set of child's swings to wiggle so invitingly and thereby present himself as an entrée to the crocodile that was making the swings wiggle so invitingly.But perhaps the single most important thing you need to know about this movie is...The dog lives.",Crawl

Crawl is nothing like Piranha. It's a viciously claustrophobic thriller, full of surprises.Competitive swimmer Haley Keller (Kaya Scodelario), just finishing training at a Florida University, gets a concerned call from her sister, not knowing a hurricane shifted its route and is headed for their hometown. Worrying, but not very concerned, about her semi-estranged father (Barry Pepper), she decides to check in on him. Arriving at his place, she finds dog Sugar all by herself and decides to go look for her dad. After being told to flee the area by concerned police officers, she ignores the warning and goes to her childhood home where she soon crawls underneath the house to find her father unconscious, with a deadly alligator blocking their way out.Most of the film takes place in the crawlspace underneath the house, as Haley and her handyman dad manoeuvre themselves into dark corners where the hungry gator can't get into. But time is running out fast in swampy Florida with water levels rising, and trying to stay ahead of the cellar getting flooded. This is where the film is at its strongest and intense with some seriously graphic scenes, one including a wrench. Aja knows just how to use this compact location with bricks, pipes and rat traps as unexpected weapons against the big bad. Haley crawls and swims through mud and faeces to outsmart her enemy. This is just asking for infections - if she survives.Running just under 90 minutes, the pace is just right to establish the daughter-father relationship between Haley and Dave, without going off the rails by boring the audience. Don't worry, the dialogue is supposed to be a little bit cheesy and the dry sense of humour helps us remind that this is supposed to be a fun little genre flick to pass the time. Scodelario and Pepper deliver above average performances, which is, when you see the film, impressive to say the least. They're basically acting in the water for the entire film and that needs to be applauded.While being stuck down there, figuring out how they'll ever escape the luring looks of the menacing predator, they try to get people's attention on the outside. A ""clawful"" of supporting characters basically get used as bait to divert attention of our main father/daughter-duo. This makes for great gory action sequences that will make you jump out of your seat.The entire first act forebodes what is yet to come, but what mostly stands out is Maxime Alexandre's cinematography. Especially his underwater shots and the way scriptwriters Michael and Shawn Rasmussen use the storm as an additional important character, is just phenomenal. It delivers an extra sense of tension and heightens the despair on survival. Our main characters have to work with the storm or die in the jaws of these prehistoric reptiles.You could say Crawl does for alligators what Jaws did for sharks. The alligators are all CGI, but the CGI looks very realistic. Big expensive blockbusters, take notes - apparently this film only got made with a $17 million budget and that's very impressive. The darker scenes make these creatures even scarier, especially when they move so smoothly in the water to jump out and chew limbs off. Aja guarantees for some bloody bone crushing scenes, without utilising jump scares for the sake of cheap thrills.This is the northern hemispheric summer blockbuster we've been waiting for and saves these dull months, from being completely boring. Go see it on the largest screen with the biggest crowd possible. Crawl sinks its teeth into you and doesn't let go.",Crawl
216,elenaphysics,Not bad,6,6 November 2019,"At first I did not want to watch it. Survival story +aligators = not my cup of tea.
But I was intriqued after I read Tarantino actually liked this movie.
So I watched it.
It is what it is. A survival story plus aligators.
The problem is that THAT'S ALL you get. No plot twists, no script at all.
Just 2 people avoiding being eaten alive.
But it kinda works because it was suspenseful. You did not know what is coming. The director did a good job.
The scenario was simple. Murphy's Law.
If something can go wrong ,it will.
So even if it was kind of ridiculous, all this bad bad luck but at the end of every attack they manage to survive. It is ridiculous but it is suspenseful.
The problem is. Should this movie go out in cinemas? No it should definitely not. It is too short (this covers for the lack of actual scenario) and it is not worth to pay the ticket. There are far better movies out there. But if you are into this kind of stories ok. At least it is much better than the Arctic which is a survival story plus snow..",Crawl

220,cadillac20,"A Fun, Edge Of Your Seat Man Vs. Nature Popcorn Flick That's Perfect For Summer",7,22 July 2019,"Ever since Spielberg gave us Jaws, it seems like the summer isn't complete without one vicious, man vs. nature flick to unease audiences. So, this year we get Crawl, a bloody, deadly serious thriller pitting our leads not just against a group of savage alligators hell bent on killing every person they come across, but a raging hurricane as well. The combo creates the kind of summer popcorn movie you'd come to expect, ridiculous and ultimately forgettable, but fun and thrilling nevertheless.Kaya Scodelario plays Haley, a collegiate swimmer who, amidst a growing, dangerous hurricane, receives a call from her sister wondering about their father, who hasn't returned any phone calls. Despite warnings, Haley decides to go find him, and in so doing discovers him injured and immobile. It isn't long before they both find themselves surrounded by the vicious alligators and running against the clock as the hurricane threatens to put them under water. Both Kaya and Barry Pepper as Haley's father put on a good show. They do an excellent job for the kind of film this is, proving to play off each other well and turn in a convincing job. Their relationship is enjoyable, much more so than what I had expected. They also prove to be resourceful and tough, and seeing them bounce off one another and the performances are surprisingly touching, where I expected the film to be more shallow. It also helps that the film is consistently thrilling, putting you on the edge of your seat near the entire film. When the gators aren't silently sneaking up on every single person in the film, the hurricane poses a threat, with the movie trading one for the other.Admittedly, it does take a little bit to go, with the beginning taking it's time to get going. The moment we get our first gator, however, things go from 2 to 10 real quick. The film is also somewhat surprisingly gory. It's not excessive, but there's plenty of blood, a few chewed and torn limbs, and some brutal gator attacks. The set pieces are taken full advantage of as well. While our leads are mostly confined to the single space, a two story house with a crawl space below, nothing is left to spare. The entire house is not only used, but the gators get access too, and it makes for some very entertaining and thrilling scenes.All of this said, the film certainly has it's flaws. Haley and her father endure a pretty sizable amount of the violence and yet, somehow not only survive, but manage to put up a hell of a fight. As entertaining as it is to watch, it's hardly believable they're in the shape they're in when all is said and done. We also get some eye rolling decisions made by our characters, mostly Haley, who goes on to do typically cliche things that get people injured or killed, like following the scary noise. Aren't we past these cliches now? The film also doesn't really do anything new or memorable. As fun as the movie is, everything in it we've seen. It deserves credit for staying mostly grounded and making creative use of it's set, but this is firmly an enjoy-it-while-you're-watching-it kind of movie. Yet, it's exactly the kind of summer film you'd expect to pop up in a theater to turn your brain off to.Obviously, this isn't going to be a film for everyone. In a time when we get some pretty glorious spectacles, shocking comedies, or head turning dramas, Crawl seems tame. But maybe it's the fact that it trades up grandiosity for some old fashioned creature-feature thrills that makes it welcome. Despite it's ridiculous nature and our character's unbelievable ability to survive, Crawl is a welcome change of pace and entertainment from what has become the standard for summer entertainment.",Crawl

223,theredsky,Crawl Review,5,14 July 2019,"Crawl is surprisingly a decent monster movie. Here are the negatives. The visual effects suck. The alligators look like they came out of a Playstation 2 game and it is kinda distracting. Barry Pepper's acting was really inconsistent. At the beginning of the film, he wasn't trying at all and his acting was pretty bad but as the film progressed, it did get better. Towards the end of the film, some of the action scenes start to get repetitive. The main character will get out of a fight with an alligator into another fight with an alligator. Another issue would be that some of the characters kinda walk off major injuries. One of the characters has a broken leg but seems to walk it off later on. My main issue is that the characters make some pretty dumb decisions. They are multiple moments where the characters could make an escape but they don't. One such scene is when one of the characters finds a shovel and instead of using it to knock out a weak wall, they decide to attract the attention of the alligators. That problem does take away from the experience of the film a little bit. Here are the positives. Kaya Scodelario does a great job as the main character. You feel for her and what she is trying to do, which is save her Dad. She does a great job at finding different and creative ways to fight off the alligators. The production design for this film is really good. The sets are pretty cool. The basement set makes you feel claustrophobic while the water fills in. The film knows how to build tension really well. The film always present this sense of danger throughout the entire scene until the last act. The beginning scene with the gators is incredibly tense. They set up the fact that the gator is in the basement and you just have to wait till they reveal it to the characters. The film is incredibly gory also. You do see people's bones sticking out of their body and you do see a gator rip a guys head off and it's incredibly intense to watch. They also make the smart decision to not use music in these tense scenes so that it feels real. The soundtrack is generic but it does have a couple good scores in there. The cinematography is decent for what the film is going for and the tone and pacing are consistent. Overall, Crawl is a decent monster movie with a good protagonist and some great set design but is held back by dumb decisions and crappy visual effects. I give Crawl a 5/10.",Crawl
224,thebogofeternalstench,Total Garbage,1,12 July 2019,"Where to start? A lame backstory with the girl being a top swimmer so she can out-swim a gang of patrolling alligators and the father and daughter's pathetic sentimental conversations in between their boring as hell attempts to evade the naughty alligators.The movie is filled with lame jump scares, and the first Mr Snappy is shown way too early, totally killing any suspense. The characters make dumb choices over and over. The girl gets death rolled under water with her arm in the alligators mouth and doesnt lose her arm? Yeh...sure. Pointless supporting actors/extras who we know are gunna die are on screen for a few mins then get gobbled up. Why bother?The girl goes through a hole in the wall and discovers a nest of eggs which would indicate a mother alligator, hinting at a bigger croc which we get to see briefly after she finds a gun on the dead cop, shoots another croc while it munches on her hand, and then crawls through a pipe with her arm intact. We get to see the mother alligator i believe and then the girl goes to save her drowning father. After reviving him from death, he gets up like nothing has happened and is like ""hey girl, go swim through all those alligators and get the boat yah?"" So instead of going on the roof which is what any other sane person would do, Olympic swimmer girl goes for a gold medal in a race against the Mr Snappy's.Blah blah blah...anyway, they end up on the roof at the end and you are expecting some final show down with the huge mother alligator, the rescue helicopter conveniently shows up and swimmer girl lights a flare and.....THE CREDITS ROLL!!!! HAHAHAHAHA.I couldn't believe it. What a scam artist the director is. You cheated your audience dude.What an awful movie.

225,joshbarton15,It won't do Florida tourism any favours but it's damn entertaining.,7,30 July 2019,"A film like Crawl is one that I really welcome amidst the onslaught of summer blockbusters we get every year. A no-nonsense, crowd-pleasing horror that gets the audience jumping and screaming is exactly what Crawl is and I couldn't have been happier for it to be the latest secret screening provided by Cineworld.When aspiring swimmer Haley Keller (Kaya Scodelario) goes to check on her father, Dave (Barry Pepper), during a category 5 hurricane in Florida, she must battle against both the rising water and the alligators who have them both cornered in the crawl space beneath their home.After a brief introduction to the lead character and her fractured relationship with her father, Alexandre Aja throws us right into the midst of the storm and doesn't let up on the suspense for a full ninety minutes. It's a film that doesn't weight itself down with unnecessary excess baggage, instead opting to keep it simple and provide a number of moments that'll make you jump and shout.Maxime Alexandre's enclosed cinematography and music composed by Max Aruj and Steffen Thum kept me right on the edge of my seat throughout however, it's the performances from Kaya Scodelario and Barry Pepper that kept me invested in proceedings. There's much to this film than just crawling about the place looking terrified and the pair of them sell it beyond belief.The gators looked a little suspect in places but I can forgive that when there's a number of gruesome deaths and plenty of gore to keep horror fans pleased. Crawl doesn't exactly do Florida a lot of favours in terms of tourism mind, combining its two biggest threats to well and truly put people off, much like Jaws probably had people staying out of the water for a whole summer back in the day.",Crawl

227,FilmBuff0409,What you'd expect,7,16 October 2019,"This movie is pretty much what I expected. It does have some intense scenes. It does get under your skin at times. My only issue with it was as hard as I tried I just couldn't suspend my disbelief. I mean, who gets attacked by an alligator (let alone an abnormally massive one) 3 TIMES and just walks it off.Haley; if you get dragged by an alligator you're pretty much dead already. In the very slim chance that he does let you go, because believe me, if that alligator doesn't want to let go, it will not let go until you're dead or the limb it's chosen has come off. But let's say luck was on your side today, once it did let go you would in no way be able run away. Yes I understand you might be in shock and not feel a thing, sure. But that leg would not be able to support your weight after just being crushed by more than 2100 psi (13x stronger than a humans).
But okay you got away, good job. Then it happens an hour later, this time the alligator bit your arm. You shot it and it leg go. Kind of believable. That much force on your arm though would likely rip it off (like shown later), so chances of you being able to even move your finger to pull the trigger is very unlikely.
Now that I mention that, the dad. He gets his arm bit clean on in a matter of a second. Why did that not happen to any of the other victims? They got away just fine with little more than a cut.
And lastly for Haley, she got her arm again in a gators mouth, but this time the gator did the death roll. Will this is happening she's just casually swimming in circles with it. NO. ABSOLUTELY NOT. That move it their way of tearing apart their food, so no you would not just swim in the same motion and be fine, your arm should realistically be gone. Should have been gone a while ago.Now for the dad, he had a bone sticking out of his leg. A literal bone! You can not tell me that he just pushed that bone back into his leg with little more than a grunt of pain. First of all you would pass out just by looking at that leg, if not then, by even the slightest touch you would be screaming in agonizing pain. So please don't try to make me believe you just push it back in and walk it off like it's a little bruise.
And when he did finally lose his arm that would cause you to be pouring blood, which would cause you to pass out and eventually die within a matter of minutes. There's a reason these animals have been around well before our time, they are perfect hunters and can kill with one bite. As an animal enthusiast who knows what an alligator can do, these people should not have survived 20 minutesBut overall if I can get past all the blatant stupidity I saw, I actually enjoyed this movie. It was fun.
So don't let my nitpicking deter you, watch it! Just don't take it too seriously, it's a seriously fun movie.",Crawl

231,gerry_barnaby,creature feature with teeth,8,23 August 2019,"Finally got to see this film after it was realized in the US, and in all honesty, this was an absolute Brutal and vicious film that involves one of the best CGI animations from Alligators film ive seen in years, giving them a dark vicious Apex predator hunting anything that moves really give the film that intense and frightening tone.What you see in the trailer is nothing for what you about to see if you dont like blood or gory this film is not a film for you, I kid you not there is a lot of scenes through this film that when the film kicks in they become extremely Vicious and frightening on a level that this situation can easily happen.For a pretty short film with a reasonable length time, the pacing is solid along with the acting as well giving a pretty solid film, but not without its flaws. There are plenty of moments through this film that gets really intense with a few jump scare moment, some being so intense as you have no idea where the alligators are under the water, this gives the film a frightening and intense nature.To make a film work like this as a horror thriller is really hard especial when you have alot of alligators it tends to take away the fear, but with this film they did a very clever thing in only showing the alligators when needed and keeping them out of sight for the most intense parts of the film. This gives the audience a sense of fear as at any moment someone could be grab and torn apart in a bloody carnage of flesh and bone.The film set mostly in a crawlspace during a hurricane which gives the audience a sense inherently claustrophobic nature, it plays with the motion very well. For a creature feature, this doesn't go beyond absurd, and unrealistic as it gives a very real and not unpossible situation giving that most of Florida's land is Gator country.So I will say this is a great film, well writen in most parts but a few flaws, but well worth watching for the most intense and brutal moments you possibly see in a film, that should've been Rated R because some scene is seriously brutal.
Dislikes: The one issue I did find was kind of a lazy set at the begin with a certain sign on the side of the road, I think the film could've had a better set up involving a rescue of alligators that went wrong would have been a better set up, but apart from this begin they did the rest of the film was actually good.The other thing that was mention in the film was being able to swim fast than an alligator in the water, this is virtually inpossible for any human to do since an adult Alligator swimming can reach up to speeds of 20 mph, While 23 time Olympic Gold Medalist Michael Phelps topped out at about 6 mph so you can see why trying to swim away from alligator is inpossible.These are the only two issue I found with the film",Crawl

Then as they're stuck the Deputy guy the family friend of theres comes to check on them but they tell him don't come to close there's alligators, so they found another exit earlier through the floor boards, why didn't they ask him to remove the table piece blocking that exit or to tear up the floor boards so they could safely get out. So again they could have found a way out together and made a safer exit on the police boat that ends up disappearing towards the end...When the dumb girl figures out there's an alligator, she goes out to the open to grab her phone ?

Now the action here is just a tonne of fun. The alligators were a surprisingly intimidating and it made for some enjoyable action and gore. The alligators did seem to give our main characters a much better chance of escaping than the side characters but that's pretty much a given in these kinds of films, so I don't mind too much. The performances are good and the film is just a really entertaining time. Unfortunately, the film is just too short to fully flesh out any of its characters, and as such the attempts at emotional moments towards the end fall completely flat.

235,pal05052003,A must see for horror fans or anyone who watches horror,8,14 July 2019,"The only reason I watched this was because it was executive produced by Sam Raimi. I was expecting SyFy movie quality, but this movie is much better than I have expected. The plot is simple: a lady tries to rescue her dad is trapped in a flooded cellar during a storm, and there are alligators lurking too. The use of the setting is perfect and the director was able to compound the unpleasant feeling of being in a flooded cellar with many alligators. Raimi's shooting style of close ups, and POV is also used to maximum effect, however there is no camp element as in the Evil Dead. Yet, the movie is a full-on creature feature that seems grounded. The shots are very immersive; the crocodiles are menacing, and though they may be CGI, they do look realistic. The storm effects are very real and literally moves the plot forward. As with many of Raimi's production works, the movie does not tone down the violence. The scenes of alligator attacks are violent and horrific. In fact, this is a movie that keeps you suspended at a regular pacing, and is almost like a game where the character seems to escape from one level, only to face the alligators in another level (literally). The only flaw is like you would have to suspend disbelief when the protagonist is mauled several times but escapes unscathed. Apart from that flaw, the movie does exactly what it is supposed to. Deliver scares and suspense, and provide some backstory so you can care for the characters. I do recommend this movie. It is worth a watch.",Crawl
236,samhill5215,Not as bad as some reviews,6,24 December 2019,"I thought I'd add my two cents here just because I think I have a unique take on the ethics displayed in the film. Yes, it was exciting! It had me all the way through! First off these had to be crocodiles, they were too large for alligators, and that added to the suspense. Imagine having to fight off these monsters. And they were definitely realistic. Kaya Scodelario was perfect for this role, she has that lean, long look of a swimmer, so good casting. Barry Pepper was also good in the standard supporting parent role. Morfydd Clark was the responsible sister in a bit role and that's too bad. She is such a good actor I really hate to see her talents wasted on this fluff. Ok, so what's my unique take? Well, here we have two people fighting the elements and managing to survive despite the odds. But had they followed the experts' advice and evacuated at least two people and possibly three more wouldn't have died. Definitely the two policemen. Had they stayed in their boat they would still be alive. As for the looters, well it could be argued they had it coming. But had they not been distracted who knows? So, listen to the advice of the authorities. All you John Wayne types who think you know better get in your trucks and skidaddle. You might just save lives.",Crawl
237,cappiethadog,This must be the dog,7,19 October 2019,"Dog rides shotgun. Hayley Keller(Kaya Scodelario), a college swimmer, can't find her recently-divorced father at his condo, but he left behind Sugar, a terrier, in ""Crawl"", a disaster survival film by Alexandre Aja. Dogs are, of course, furry people, beloved and irreplaceable, but there is a Category 5 hurricane in-progress and Haley shouldn't have blown off the cops' warning at the roadblock to turn back. One of the policemen was Wayne(Ross Anderson), her sister's ex. Right away, you know he's going to die. People who ignore mandatory evacuation warnings get rescue workers killed. And in ""Crawl"", not only is there extreme weather, but killer alligators, too. The odds of him surviving are worse than the dog. If Hayley locates her father, at least the human wrangler, should he put his life on the line, won't have to die in vain. Dog guilt-trips girl. As they drive to their old house, this University of Florida coed explains to her terrier-mix mutt with sad accusatory eyes that she's not in high school anymore, things change, especially since Dave Keller(Barry Pepper) doesn't come to his daughter's swimming meets anymore. Hayley pulls up to her own old residence. Dad is ""home"". She sees his truck parked out front, but her calls still go to voicemail. Dog knows his limitations. The terrier doesn't try to be a hero. Sugar's barking alerts Hayley that the old man is down in the cellar, probably incapacitated, but incapacitated how? The terrier stays put. She lets Hayley do all the heavy lifting. Father and daughter are reunited; he's incapacitated because of alligator bites. Good girl. And smart girl. Sugar knows that the competitive swimmer can outdistance the alligators with a mean breaststroke. This terrier knows that her inelegant dog paddle just won't cut it in the event should the basement flood. Inevitably, the entire house gets deluged with water. Dog wades down hallway. This is when the audience holds its collective breath. This is when Sugar gets it; food for alligator thought. But the plucky terrier dog paddles her way into Dave's arms, safe and sound. ""Crawl"" subverts genre expectations. Is the filmmaker trying to tell us something? And then the audience notices; these are angry alligators, not hungry alligators. Haley bumps into the floating corpse(that would be Wayne), fully intact. She is also perilously close to a water nest of reptilian hatchlings. If they gang up on Hayley, she has the wherewithal to wipe out a generation. The alligators have no beef with the terrier. Two legs, not four, that's their battle hiss.""Never Turn Your Back on Mother Earth"", Depeche Mode's Martin L. Gore once sang.Captain Nolan(Richard Harris) angered the wrong killer whale. Instead of harpooning the male, he hits his pregnant mate, who subsequently gets herself caught in the boat propeller and dies. Onboard the Bumpo, in ""Orca"", an offshoot of Steven Spielberg's ""Jaws"", directed by Michael Anderson, the suddenly widowed orca screams in anguish as he watches the fetus fall out of his partner's womb onto the deck. Nolan grabs a hose and sends the unborn to its watery grave. The surviving whale sees it all. His POV shot is followed by a close-up; he gives Nolan, his adversary, what can only be described as ""the evil eye"". Yes, indeed; a whole lot of anthropomorphism is going on. This killer whale intuitively knows the oft-quoted passage from Exodus: ""An eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth."" He targets Captain Nolan for revenge. The orca sets his sights on Annie(Bo Derek), the girlfriend of Nolan's right-hand man Ken(Robert Carradine), mistaking her, most likely, for the captain's woman. This killer whale, just like the alligators, mounts a successful home invasion, knocking out the foundation of Nolan's oceanfront house. Annie slides down the slanted floor, leaving her leg exposed towards the sea. The orca bites it off. In ""Crawl"", Hayley is considerably luckier; her leg, despite being in the alligator's clutches, may be bloodied a good deal, but it stays intact. Since the killer whale had an agenda, the audience has to ask: ""What about the killer reptile?""Arguably, yes.Hayley, swimming as if her life depended on it, beats the alligator to the motor boat. She rescues her father and dog. Their relative safety, however, is a short-lived one, when the gathering storm waters slam their tiny seafaring craft back where they started. In actuality, Hayley and her dad are defending themselves against not one, but two menaces; displaced alligators and extreme weather. Man and alligator, quite pointedly, share a common enemy. Both films end in a helicopter rescue. Hayley flags down a chopper with a sent flare from their rooftop. Rachel Bedford(Charlotte Rampling), a scientist, is the last woman standing after Nolan gets his just desserts. The distress signal that Umilak(Will Sampson) had sent out, just prior to the Native-American being fatally injured by an avalanche, results in an answered SOS call. Stranded on an ice floe in the Arctic Ocean, the helicopter descends on Rachel, mourning her loss.Forty-plus years pass between ""Orca: The Killer Whale"" and ""Crawl"". Those glaciers and breakaway icebergs aren't there anymore. They melted. The ocean waters are rising. These alligators know that dogs aren't responsible for global warming. The Category 5 hurricane is not the terrier's fault. One alligator, more compassionate than the rest, allows Hayley to keep her leg as a warning.The killer whale begrudged, only, a single man. Granted, the orca was something of a narcissist.It's mankind that these reptilian activist rightfully exact their vengeance upon.They're not the cause of the horror in ""Crawl""; they're the effect.",Crawl

'Crawl' is better than the average man vs. beast- film. Well shot with great and seameless effects and with a solid casting. The father, daughter and dog- trio really pulled it off. Now and then the film gets a bit gory, and that exactly what it needs, no PG-13 -bs. Like in all similar films, there are certain tropes that you have to include to make the story go forward; lots of good luck and coincidents, several ""who's going to make it?""-type of situations and the most famous, ""Yes, I almost got my leg chewed off but I can still use it like nothing happened"". That is why I cannot give this more than 7. (More accurate would be 6,5, but cannot do that.) But to be fair, it would be almost impossible to give 10 to a this type of film, no matter how well done it is.

Then again, Florida kinda does for Florida what Psycho did for showers.The movie was directed by Alexandre Aja who made both the Hills Have Eyes and Piranha remakes- amazingly this is his most original movie- but he's very good at creating a foreboding atmosphere in the opening moments.It's all concept- I doubt there was much of a script here- and the kills that come in the opening hour are all fairly predictable.The gator looks as fake as the shark did but it jives with how stupid the rest of this is.For example Haley's dad is actually a crazy sports parent, so much so he gives her crap for a swim meet while she's trying to concentrate on not getting eaten.Their relationship is swimming metaphors and parental divorce soap opera, nothing terribly interesting.But we get some quality blood and gore and the movie works in B-grade fashion.If you liked this, check out Craig James Review on Youtube for more",Crawl

It uses a small closed environment and is not trying to go too big, which I personally really appreciated, it worked well here and it still managed to tell a story even if the premise is very simple. And Kaya Scodelario and Barry Peppar does a very good job as the main actors. They look scared when they're suppose to look scared, they look like they're in pain when they're hurt, and they get banged up quite a bit in this movie, fighting both the alligators and the storm. And that they're suppose to have this strained but very strong father and daughter relationship, seemed believable, so good job on the actors. The cgi gators and the storm looked realistic enough as well. And there is also some gore, as it should be. Good fun MOVIE.

Doesn't seem like the kind of movie that would get high critical praise, but here we are. What did I think of it? While this movie is very stupid with some very cheesy and unrealistic moments and a ton of stuff that doesn't make sense, I enjoyed it. Much like Brightburn, this movie has a big director attached to it as a producer, Sam Raimi. This movie does feel kind of Evil Dead-ish, it's about people in an isolated location with a creepy basement trying to survive, but it's not nearly as good. Honestly, I really don't have much to say about this movie. This movie doesn't overstay its welcome and it succeeds at precisely what it sets out to do, just be entertaining. It doesn't really try to be anything more. I can't really fault the movie for that. As for my recommendation, does a killer alligator movie sound appealing to you? If yes, give it a watch.

255,Benslie,A surprisingly good film,7,24 July 2019,"First of all, the suspense in this film is top-notch and was used effectively. For a majority of the film, you follow Haley and her dad in a crawl space and if you've ever been in one you know it's a small space and despite the small space a lot of stuff goes down. There is very little to no music throughout the entire film which helps keep the viewer on the edge of their seat the entire time. Neither the characters or the audience know where the gators are at any time and it causes for some scenes where people get scared. The acting in this film done by the two leads was well done. Both Kaya Scodelario and Barry Pepper did fantastic jobs with their characters and made them feel like real-life people that you want to see survive till the end. They seem like an actual father-daughter relationship with the ups and downs that come with it. I also just want to say that Haley is a badass and super resourceful. She isn't afraid to do anything if it means both she and her father will live. But this is where you need to turn off your brain for the film because some logic isn't followed. In the film, you can see here getting hurt from the gator but no repercussions. With her dad, you seem him hurt and having a hard time to walk but with her, she just shrugs it off and walks just fine. I'm sorry but yeah no you should be limping and or dead cause both of them would have died from blood loss just saying. Also, in my opinion, this film would have worked better as a short film because at times it felt like it was dragging on because they need to make it a full-length feature film. In the end, Crawl actually isn't that bad and worth watching at a cheap price. I give Crawl a 7.5/10.",Crawl

From then on, worrying about Dad is the least of her problems. We've got Alligators - now I have never seen an Alligator up close but if they're as big as the ones in this movie, then no wonder they've been around for millions of years!Between, the hurricanes, burst riverbanks, alligators in the house, injuries and the untimely demise of various secondary characters, Haley and Dad are in for one hell of a ride.Kaya Scodelario plays Haley, who luckily for her and the film is a swimmer and a bliming good one at that. The actress shows she is game for anything that the director -Alexandre Ajathrows at her. She is definitely one to watch in action circles as well as playing the role with a lot of heart. Barry Pepper is her Dad - Dave. Which is a real worry for me, seeing Mr Pepper play the father of a twenty-something, as someone who thought he was amazing as Sniper Pvt.Jackson in Saving Private Ryan it makes me realise how old I'm getting(I went to see that film with my Dad for Pete's sake). He is definitely a Dad who can handle himself and grizzled is probably the best adjective to describe him.This harks back to the classic creature features, you don't need a huge cast, just a dedicated one who are up for anything. Oh, and some big ole beasties and this film ahs both. It's fast paced and full of teeth. An enjoyable 87 minutes. Just long enough to keep you on your toes or treading water.

She's a world class swimmer, thanks to him, but his methods and psychology caused a riff that's never healed. So when her sister says ""Dad's not answering his phone,"" our heroine drives into the incoming storm to find him.

I didn't felt any tension or suspense and at certain point in the end i got bored, even though the film is 87 minutes long - it felt far too long than it needed to be.The film introduces some side characters that make some really stupid decisions and the only reason of why they are in the film is just to get killed. They show up in different points in the story, so that it can have a death count. They didn't know how to write good characters and for that reason it was very difficult to care, when someone dies. That doesn't mean that the two main characters don't do some dumb things as well. Even they fall on the same trap in a few moments in the film.The performances of Kaya Scodelario and Barry Pepper, the sound and the cinematography were the aspects that hold the film together, but everything would eventually fall apart with it's other aspects in many moments like the story, characters, dialogue, the acting from the rest of the cast, visual effects and music.",Crawl

The movie is set in a basement which seems huge for the size of the house above it. The characters have no development so you dont really care for them and the dialogue is bare.
There is plenty of water in this movie, ironically the movie has no depth. Just alligators popping up and attacking one after the other.

There are no ""Super-gators"" here, just regular-sized alligators, let loose by a natural disaster to do what they do naturally.""Crawl"" does not attempt to overreach, instead settling into an uncomfortable niche as a movie in which a couple of sympathetic and realistically flawed people seek to overcome a pretty believable danger, even as they work out the life-differences that threaten to drive them apart.Solid acting, some beautifully evinced special effects, and alligators that are plenty realistic enough to make me jumpy, all serve a well-written, genuinely suspenseful movie. The only flaws I noticed were an occasional stumble into bathos.The entire film is a credit to the technical craft of movie-making, especially on what is reported to be a small budget. The lighting and cinematography defy typical poorly-lit, murky horror movie tropes. In ""Crawl"" everything can be clearly seen...and heard...Even when the viewer might wish they could not (an Oscar nomination for Sound Editing would be deserved).And the final shot in the movie!

287,gluonpaul,Good production values and acting but it cant hide a terrible script,4,23 August 2019,"So there is plenty in this to like, the special effects are decent, the acting is decent and the production values are very good. Unfortunately its all built on the foundations of a very very poor script.The father seems to only be there to provide someone to constantly need rescuing by the daughter and provide a backdrop of history for the protagonist (often at very stupid times). At one point they had just seen a police officer get torn apart & eaten and he launches into a speech about the daughter learning to swim. I mean really????On top of that the protagonist is basically the very definition of a mary sue. At one point for instance this huge alligator has her leg clamped in his jaws and this 80 pound woman kicks it in the face with her bare foot to get it to let go, on top of which all she had as an injury was a minor gash on her leg. Absolutely crazy, and this goes on througout the movie, we see her outswim alligators in the water as well for instance.Overall I have to say with a decent script it could have been a good concept but with some frankly student film level script problems it just isnt that great in my opinion. Not a terrible movie, but not really worth seeking out.",Crawl

292,rustonreviews,A gleefully savage creature feature.,8,24 August 2019,"One of the most underappreciated sub-genres out there is undoubtedly the creature feature. I'm often always sold on a film should they include sharks, crocodiles or other monstrous creatures with an appetite for us humans. Films like Eaten Alive (1976), Lake Placid (1999), and Rogue (2007) are all guilty pleasures of mine, so Alexandre Aja's new alligator infested picture effortlessly grabbed my attention once its trailer dropped. When a category 5 hurricane devastates Florida, Haley Keller (Scodelario) ignores all evacuation instructions to search for her estranged father who is unresponsive during the hurricane. She finds her father injured and unconscious in the crawl space of their Coral Lake home. As Haley works on rescuing her father, she learns that a monstrous alligator has been swept into the crawl space as a result of the torrential flooding. With Haley and her father trapped in the crawl space with the predator as the water gradually begins to rise, it becomes a desperate game of survival against both nature and beast.Like most creature features, Crawl is an enormously fun film and one of the stronger efforts in Aja's filmography. Both Scodelario and Pepper are two likable leads and their estranged relationship is portrayed effectively, making it easy to root for them both as the disaster amplifies. Clocking in at a brisk 87 minutes, Crawl is a tense and sometimes brutal story of survival. One of the biggest factors that can fail a creature feature is poor CGI. Thankfully, the alligators here look pretty great. Never once did any of the effects here look poorly rendered or embarrassingly amateur (see 2007's Lake Placid 2 for some of the worst crocodile CGI to ever disgrace a movie), and the level of practical effects on display here result in a pretty engrossing ride. There are of course a handful of characters introduced purely for the sake of being alligator fodder, resulting in some savagely entertaining kills inbetween the various efforts of the protagonists to escape their devastated home amidst alligator infested waters. As expected within this sub-genre, there are moments in which you certainly have to suspend disbelief during some of the attacks. The films ending is also rather abrupt and could have perhaps benefited from an additional scene to provide some satisfying closure. Nevertheless, Crawl is a widely entertaining film from beginning to end and ranks as one of the best creature features in recent memory.",Crawl

I love Sam Raimi, his work in The Evil Dead, Drag Me To Hell, and Spiderman he never failed to amaze me on how well he works in different genres. He loves to make you cringe with gorey scenes which is the only think I liked about this film. Though critics raved for this film I disliked it very much due to its very slow pace. It went to places for sure but very very slowly. There were scenes that might've made you have hope and then the mood would be killed almost immediately. A failed swimmer somehow outran the alligators so many times almost getting killed by the jaws of death yet somehow survived alot of it and how the hell did the father survive through all that pain?!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I am impressed he could even walk without feeling five tons of tension. The acting was I guess good, except, like every horror movie, when there is the pain factor actors don't seem to make you feel what they feel. In real life if you get bit by a gator you are gonna be wincing walking through the water and swimming and all that, when you get bit and you are trying to outrun something the pain I'd gonna feel so bad you are gonna wish you'll never have been born, and when you get bit it's gonna be so much pressure you won't want to move(unless you got adrenaline).",Crawl

After losing the race, which is excitingly staged in a way that bodes well for the rest of the film, she remembers her father Dave (Barry Pepper) coaching her as a young girl. ""You're the apex predator all day,"" he tells her in flashback - although anyone who's seen any of the recent Predator movies might question if that's a compliment or not.
There's another positive omen here. In the locker room, while changing, Haley talks on the phone to her older sister Beth (Morfydd Clark). The camera stays on her face. With a Category 5 hurricane heading their way, neither sister can contact their wayward father Dave, so Haley decides to drive over to get him - no matter that the police are rather inconveniently closing the roads.

Writing Quality: Strong. The script focuses on the wavering bond between a daughter and her father that is quickly strengthened and secured in this tense action thriller. Both dialogue and action are realistic given the dangerous circumstances. Instead of resorting to frozen fear, the two main characters use wisdom and quick reflexes to survive.
Scare Factor: The whole premise is frightening and mostly realistic: a local hurricane that plummets a Florida town into a rising flooding zone and alligators that get washed away from their nearby farm. father & daughter must think fast as the water levels rapidly submerge their home and a swarm of alligators look for their next meal. There are a few places where you will jump.
Content (sex, language, & violence): No sex, a few instances of harder curse words, but not for shock value, and violence is a bit intense though mostly quick from alligator attacks and people defending themselves against them. A few shots of graphic bloody wounds.

That tautness in the directing remains here, but simplifies the story a lot more, and gives the story exactly what it needs.The plot is simple - daughter, father, and also dog, are trapped in a house during hurricane season, and have to escape a swarm of alligators. And it delivers precisely what you want to see. High octane and creative set pieces using well established locations and geography, bloody, gory deaths, jump scares that made me literally scream in the cinema - don't mean to brag but that's quite hard to do - and a credits roll with ""See you later Alligator"" playing over it.Kaya Scodelario and Barry Pepper are a great pairing, with Pepper playing a grieving parent trying to help his emotionally distant daughter focus on her future and surviving, and Scodelario does a great job of selling the danger, she looks in great shape which does help to sell the action scenes, and she also does an excellent job of keeping up her American accent during these high tension moments.Go and see this movie - if you like creature features, there's probably not going to be one better out soon.",Crawl

They actual seemed like a father/daughter duo that cared for each other. The way Dave encouraged Haley when she was second guessing herself was so heartwarming. However, my favorite character had to be the dog, Sugar. Sugar was definitely the smartest character in the movie. She found where Dave was, and knew when there was trouble. Also, it had some good jump scares. Now for what I didn't really enjoy. For starters, the cgi on the gators could have been better. I know nothing is perfect, but in 2019, the alligators looked just a bit too digital. Second thing was, could the characters really have all the strength they had with all their injuries. Haley got bit in the leg, and was able to outswim a gator. Also, one gator bit her shoulder, and put her through the death roll (always love a good death roll/I anticipated seeing it), and she could swim fine and but pressure on it to reach the room.

336,shawthingproductions,Did I see a different film!?,3,29 July 2019,"I don't understand the good reviews for this. I just watched an early screening in Cineworld, as part of their Secret Screening. I was excited when it came up what the film was because I have wanted to watch it but - wow, this is NOT a good film. It's not even a mediocre film. Put simply, it's trash.The acting:
Serviceable. They play the roles asked of them but the characters are paper thin so, really, this isn't an issue. A lot of screaming, a lot of grunts, a lot of whinging. I'll be honest, I kind of wanted the alligators to eat everyone in the film.The effects:
Mostly okay. They're not amazing but there are some nice moments in there. One early shot shows the alligator casually go past in the back of the shot; very subtle and pretty tense as, if you're paying attention, it is your first glimpse of one being present. Focus on the actor (doubtful) and you'll likely miss the gator.The script:
Jesus. It's bad. Why go to the house to do repairs in a hurricane?! You're warned to leave so - what the hell is that about? Why do these characters not understand that yelling into a hurricane is just a waste of time? The first person didn't hear you, the next person won't either. There are very few smart decisions made in this film... I mean, even less than what you would expect in this TYPE of film because let's be honest - we're not expecting a masterpiece. We're wanting something fun with some chomp chomp action but, nope. The decisions and story itself, along with what happens, just made me angry.What's right with it?
Some nice gore moments. It's short. That's pretty much it.If you're looking for a fun alligator / crocodile film - just go watch Lake Placid again. At least that was a fun popcorn film. This just dire.",Crawl

Many critics called this an entertaining albeit farfetched movie. I'd agree with the latter.Creature features are obviously not meant to be gems. And movies like Lake Placid and Tremors are terrible films in their own endearing ways. But part of me looks back fondly on those movies because they relied less on special effects and more on building tension in more natural ways.There weren't any technical flourishes to bail out terrible pacing and writing, so tension was placed more on what you can't see. I was also a kid when I saw those movies, so my imagination filled in the gaps. Sadly, this movie neither builds tension effectively nor does it do anything particularly interesting or novel with the technical capabilities of modern film making.Not impressed.

I was especially creepy to us as we have a house with a crawl space - a very short basement, about 4 1/2ft high but not in FL. Otherwise the events are impossible. The dad goes to board up in the basement, while the basement had large holes in it made with brick work intentionly - who makes that, gators wont get in but possum, mice, rats, snakes etc is prime for this basement. The basement also has a sewer size pipe goes right to the outside from the basement, oh the metal grate is broken, even if it was in place the other animals would get through the large spacing. No house would have this setup. This dad daughter duo do not get a break for long time.
When she gets the boat she swings it by so fast to get her dad but when a levee breaks, they sit there until the large rush of water drags them. Now this is a 2 story house, the water rises past the 2nd floor, even in New Orleans I believe most people who were on roofs were on ranch homes.",Crawl

Simple, yet effective, and brilliant, near perfect disaster movie",8,27 July 2019,"I just came back from seeing Crawl and I must say, this was a VERY impressive movie from start to finish. It starts off with us getting to know an appropriate amount about Haley and her Dave, and of course we get to know more about these two later on, and it all is totally appropriate for this movie.This film is not just some forgettable monster movie you only need to watch once. This movie makes you really care about the story that takes place in this, it makes you really care about Haley and Dave, and that is partially due to their actors' performances and they totally nail every scene..... There is not a single scene that is not focused on these two, there is not like 5 scenes in a row without Dave, the movie is focused on them, their relationship and their working together to try and survive this chaos. And because they are both fantastic in this movie, they totally convince me that they are father and daughter and I totally care about these two without a shadow of a doubt.The alligators are also super awesome in this. Keep in mind, these bad boys are CGI and I honestly kept forgetting that in the movie. Tbh, for the first gator that showed up, the CGI did look great, but it was almost a little too obvious that it was CGI if you notice its movements which appear a little too cartoony, but that is really just a nitpick there.Are are some logic issues in regards to what happens to when the characters get bitten and stuff.... Let's just say they kinda act like it's more of a bee sting when they are injured..... That is not the case when one is bitten by such jaws from sea or swamp animals......The visuals are absolutely awesome in this. The cinematography is pretty great! The production of this movie made the hurricane and heavy heavy rainfall appear quite frightening! The way everything looks from the basement to outside, looks fantastic, and part of this movie is rather claustrophobic! I can't wait to get this on blu ray!In all, this movie REALLY is able to pull you in for a wild ride of survival and you'll get really tensed up by the events of Crawl. People are calling this the kind of movie you'd just sit back and relax and enjoy....ummm I WASN'T RELAXED AT ALL! THIS MOVIE WAS QUITE TENSE! I don't even want to relax to movies! HahahaI give this an 8.5/10! A completely rewatchable rainy ride of survival that will leave you satisfied in the end! This movie is quite spectacular in all but the performances of Kaya Scodelario and Barry Peter makes this movie truly unforgettable and worth buying on home release! I wish I were comfortable to give the movie like a 9/10, but the logic issues and anticlimactic ending kinda brings it down some.",Crawl

Considering that most of the film there were only two characters I still found it quite gripping.

But the movie is not so terrible, in fact, the characters have some personality and as predictable as the movie manages to entertain you once in a while about the conversations of the protagonists about their personal life or see how the crocodiles devour brutally to the secondary characters. But well this movie fails in what many movies and series fail favoritism to the protagonists, with this I mean that they manage to survive successfully without any ability especially to situations that secondary characters failed to survive for example if you saw the movie you will have Noticed how crocodiles brutally devour the secondary and when one of the crocodiles manages to bite a protagonist this simply waits for the protagonist to be released, as I said we saw how that crocodile brutally ate the others and the protagonist it is simply bitten in very convenient parts to which it can survive, but that is all, we do not see those aggressive crocodiles that we saw previously, or we also have situations in which they manage to save themselves from ridiculously crocodiles and everything else is More of the same, and to tell you the truth, that's all I have to say about Crawl, it's not like the mu movie What to talk about, in conclusion this is a movie with characters with some personality, a simple and repetitive plot, passable special effects, in a nutshell it is 5/10 meh.",Crawl

However, audiences are getting pickier than before after recent horror films' training, the audience began to get tired of the traditional jump scared. Crawl provides a form of horror that is not new but is rare in recent years.Let the characters aside, 'cause people always act stupid in horror film. The way that Crawl control the atmosphere is other horror films don't have. Unlike ghost haunting, you may don't know what is next shock for you, Crawl told you from the very beginning of the film, gators, they hid in the water, in the dark, in the corner of your eyesight. And you always know what they capable and what way they are going to jump out. Because the audience knows, it makes the film even more horrifying than others. Just like Jaws, you know what they can do, so you know the shock is anytime now, which makes the atmosphere tenser and really bring the audience into the scene.However, this film does have a weird character building. The daughter and his father's background story did not help the film show the beauty of humanity, compared to the cold-blooded crocodiles. There is no effective emotional interaction between the father and daughter. The film is too focused on giving the daughter a reason to save her and explain why she can swim so fast.Overall, Crawl is a horror film with a relatively novel theme in recent years.

If you want fairly mindless excitement and jump scares, or if you like professional wrestling, then this movie is for you. Basic premise is a bit odd. Daughter drives long distance through and into storm to look for father. As if it's not possible that his phone just died, or he's busy preparing for the storm, or a few cell towers went out due to the storm. (OK -- not to be too picky -- but would the other swimmers in that locker room really want her engaging in a video-chat in the locker room? Just saying.) And the dad goes into the crummy basement with a coat (that he hangs up down there), and takes his radio with him (presumably to work on plumbing, as the storm approaches). (Is the radio that darned important? Can't he leave it upstairs and turn up the volume?) At first the dad seems near dead, but minutes later he's fully cognizant. He explains his leg injury as occurring on the pipes; but why, as the gator could have easily crunched those bones without the need for any pipes? I'm having trouble visualizing the broken leg on the pipes. Do houses really have storm drains like that? I don't get it; why would you need a pipe 3 feet in diameter leading from the basement? A 3 inch pipe would suffice for drainage. Seems like an invitation for all sorts of vermin. (Speaking of which -- the basement was constantly filling with water from the outside, through those openings in the bricks, and this seemed to be surface water. If so, then basic laws of physics would mean that water would come up that pipe first, like a straw in a soda.) Presumably the gators got loose during the storm, so how did they have time to lay eggs? And the gators could just climb up onto any land they chose, so why go through some crummy concrete pipe into a crummy basement? And when you get your cell phone in the middle of Gator-Town, don't hurry back to safety before calling 911. And trick the Gator into going into the shower; that will hold the same gator that that crashes through wood and windows. And those gators are wise to patrol that one street, that will get 3 thieves, 2 cops, and a father-and-daughter mending old wounds. (There can't be 5-6 gators for every block in town. That math makes way too many gators.) The whole father-daughter thing is probably needed to add some plot, but it's all trite and predictable. And the wounds -- amazing. People get thrashed and slashed by gators and can then walk and crawl and stumble and swim. But again -- if you want to watch people slithering away from gator jaws and gators jumping up to crunch people, then it's good fun. Surprised by the high ratings on here.",Crawl
412,compmend,"A good creature movie, where the creature isn't so far fetched.",8,20 August 2019,"Pros:
This movie builds up the main characters giving them a back story and adding an extra dimension to them.The premise take the real life and a bit of imagination to create a horror story that makes you wonder about the possibilities.The camera work and special effects worked really well together to create tight action shots that make your heart pound and long distant shots that tightens your stomach.The filming locations seemed to be authentic of a coastal town in Florida.Since this was a horror film, the dialogue is sparse, but, what dialogue there is is convincing. The actors also did an excellent job of showing their character's emotions with facial features and body language.The CGI was really good and convincing.Cons:
The alligators looked a little bit like crocodiles in some of the scenes with wider snouts than a gator typically has.There were some obvious holes in the plot, where you don't really understand the motives and actions of the characters.The movie makes alligators look a lot more aggressive, stronger, and smarter than they really are. I know this makes the movie more interesting but, to those of us who have been around alligators our whole lives it is a bit cringe.The basement in a home near the water in Florida is not something you see very often. More often than not the homes next to flood areas are built up on stilts, blocks, etc. to raise the foundation above the flood levels.

Some of these hold up over time because they over achieved what they were supposed to be. Ahem, Jaws.

Before the film it's explained on the screen, even before the commercials, that this film was based on true events in 2018. That's probably where the reality ended. The film starts with stiff acting and a cameraman who seems to have to find the right angle. But suspense starts and you just wonder where this is going.
As long as we stay in the basement, this is actually a pretty solid movie. CGI-wise it could be better, but it's by far no Sharknado, it's much better than that and you keep wondering, where do these people get the strength to go on.
But then shit hits the fan outside of the house. Slapstick, over the top, totally unbelievable and, in my opinion, completely useless in the whole movie, except for the laughs, because boy, did I laugh out loud watching some of this.
Then, all logic goes out of the window. When you think 'This can't be topped', it will be topped, when you think, 'Don't do this'. they will do it, and yes, some of you might want to look away for moments like that. Some things stay unexplained, but by that time, you won't really care, because then you think: how can the waterlevel outside of the house be higher when there's the house is not a closed environment and there are holes everywhere. And yes, alligators keep hunting when there's a hurricane and violent floods. You have to hand it to them, they keep trying!!
So, 5 stars, because it's so over the top, it's rediculous. 5 stars, because it's so much better than all the crap we've seen over the past years and the first half of the movie is pretty solid. Then 5 stars for comic relief. Damn, did I have fun, but damn, did I shake my head at all the action.
I am curious to see who will give this higher than 6 stars and to what movies people would compare this to. because after all, this can't be better than the true classics we've seen in the past.
This could have been the alligator version of Jaws. (That's why I think they opted for 'Crawl' as a title.) but the moment the animals stop at the gasstation, is when the creators missed their turn on the highway and went down south.

426,superman1,ALLIGATICANE,4,30 May 2020,"Alligaticane, or Alligatorricane as it's known in Serbia, Alligator Hurricane in China, is a high-end Sharknado. It's funny seeing in the Special Features producer The Evil Dead Sam Raimi say how original this film is, that how come no one has thought of alligators in a hurricane before?
Also of note is both dad and dau get one hand and one leg bit. Is that symbolic? Talk about like father like daughter. Together they make a whole person.Though the character played by the alligator was believable, there wasn't huge depth as the water was shallow, like ""The Shallows.""
I felt the alligator action too often go a bit beyond reality, rather than the wiser choice a bit within reality. Plus it needed more outside characters to add variety, and suspense of skilful alternative actions. This relief only happened once, soon cut short by obvious cliché. Hurricalligator was too monotonous with two hands below deck.The similar ""Bait,"" with sharks, is better, and I don't think jumps the shark. Hurricaney Horror Gator (Philippines) jumps the alligator once, so almost every time. ""Rogue"" of over 10 years ago, and ""Lake Placid"" of 20 years ago, means see you again alligator in 10.
But the shock value makes it worth it.
The most important thing of a proper mauling by alligator is gratifyingly seen in this filmnado. That's the main thing. At its head, a dull start was misguidedly substituted for the alternate opening, but allowed a cringy act of female heroinism at its tail.Now what would be original is Alligators and Sharks together.",Crawl

Regular ass bite your arm off scary enough on their own alligators. It's not Cloverfield. It's 10 Cloverfield Lane. And it's great.This film succeeds through fantastic writing and great acting. Barry Pepper is a guy who can be 61* level fantastic or Battlefield Earth level awful. Not because he's a bad actor but because his movie choice is iffy and he's at the mercy of the people he's surrounded by. He chose well here as writers Shawn and Michael Rasmussen, despite a less than stellar track record deliver a fantastic script. The father/daughter dialogue that was essential to the film comes off completely natural and never slips into the territory of cliched.I know that Kaya Scodelario has been around for years and was part of the Maze Runner series but I personally would not have been able to pick her out of a lineup of one before this movie. She's great. A lot of the movie involves her on her own in terrifying situations and she never comes off as a damsel in distress nor does she come off as an unrealistic badass. Just a normal person fighting for survival. She's great doing that and is equally great showing off her relationship with Pepper.Their relationship carries the film. Supplanted by damn fine camera work and surprisingly good effects, you begin to feel for them and root for their survival. And when you pull that off as so many lesser horror movies fail to do, the tension is tense, and hell, even the jump scares are scary. You have to make us care FIRST. And then the horror works wonders.Crawl is a stylish, well written, and well performed horror flick, escaping the pitfalls of the majority of disaster movies to deliver a perfectly paced, perfectly fun 85 minute thrill ride. I can't reccomend it enough",Crawl

A FICTIONAL MOVIE! People were bashing this movie at my screening because ""houses in Florida don't have basements."" Really? So freaking dumb lol. For the record, though, it is a crawl space below the house that is still above ground and is indeed common in Florida. This movie takes the overused basic formula of racing against time to escape whatever situation the characters find themselves in before they die.....house in Florida...hurricane hits....extreme flooding and people are trapped with the water levels rising higher and higher...can they find help or find a way to escape before it's too late? That alone would be enough for a movie these days....it has been enough over and over again and has been done a million times before...so let's make it interesting and throw in some crazy aggressive ass alligators to spice things up- another Hollywood favorite, as far as themes are concerned....killer shark/dinasaur/gator/dog .... Combining the two themes certainly wasn't breaking any barriers but it was fast paced, creative and super fun to watch. The characters are likable.enough for people to root for them. No one on the set of this movie was eyeing a freaking Oscar nom when creating this...they knew exactly what kind of movie they were making, and for as ""unrealistic"" and ""basic"" as this movie was, they jam packed a whole lot of suspense, gore, thrills and fun into a 85 minute movie, and it was a great movie theater experience.

I don't expect a movie to change my core values, trigger an existential crisis or bring about world peace... I expect it to entertain me, and that is exactly what this particular movie did.
For anyone who has been through a hurricane ( and I have several) the scenery and CGI brings it on home... I could practically taste the stinging cold rain on my face and feel the pressure changes in my eardrums.
The cast delivered their lines in such a natural way that one could be forgiven for believing they were just normal everyday people fighting their way through a terrible situation.
Barry Pepper never disappoints, and much kudos to kaya Scodelario... Not just for pulling off the generic American accent, but for carrying the film as a female protagonist who is believable both in her actions, reactions and limitations, not afraid to have her mascara run, and not needing to emasculate every male in the supporting cast to prove her feminine superiority... Take notes angels and busters. I was thrilled that not one scene had her taking out seven angry 'gators with frickin' laser beams on their heads using only her feminine pluck and an origami crane made of rice-paper...
There are plenty of jump scares and spine chilling suspense to keep the (simple) plot moving...
Lastly, what can I say about Cso-Cso's riveting performance as ""Sugar"" the dog... Rarely has so much emotion been conveyed with such limited dialogue... Reminiscent of the days of Chaplin and Keaton... Bravo",Crawl

Also after hearing the alligators were completely CGI almost turned me off, until I actually watched the movie.The films tight run time was a big advantage, no fat on this one. It's lean, mean and proud of what it is and that's what I loved most about it. The actors all did fine, the main actress stood out above the rest and the dog also made the movie more enjoyable.The alligators started out a bit rough looking, but once the movie kicked it into gear the CGI fit very well in, and the alligators were fierce. Quite a bit of blood which I loved and lots of intense moments (mostly involving the dog).Alexander Aja did a fine job with this one, definitely the kind of movie to see with an audience just to watch their reactions.

In a country where packs of terrifying reptiles are hunting humans for sport a daughter and father will bond again and face this evil of earth.OMG. I am so glad I do not live in USA. People of this beautiful country must be real tough SOBs. I just would not survive, I will be honest. I will probably be like the policeman who had a crash on main character, gentle sould. Such a shame that he ended in such a brutal way. No, this is no place for me.Ok so what do we have here. A movie, where father and daughter are trapped during tropical storm in a house infested with gators. Father is not responding to the calls and one daughter on the request of other is sent to investigate. Like a detective she follows the clues which lead her to the house from which she cant escaped. Encircled by the deadly gators she tries to rescue her and her father. The storm is raging and with no one to ask for help this almost Olympic swimmer will face worse fears to survive.I can tell you straight away that I have really enjoyed this movie. It was ok, it was full of nonsense and really hard to imagine events but I liked it. My partner on the other hand hated the movie. She walked out and was no shy with accusing movie for being super stupid and uninteresting. Well, it was but it was also made really well.The storm and this constant rain with this feeling of isolation and horror was really well done. The movie itself was well directed and you could feel squeezing through the tight basement corridors.I can say one thing about her father. He is tougher than Spartan warrior. He is gravely wounded by the beast but still going strong. At some point he suffers another, fatal to 99% of humans, deadly injury but carries on. He is honestly one of the meanest fathers ever featuring in a movie. Just wow, watch it, you will know what I mean.The same can be said about the daughter. She is holding up in the pool, restricted by the circumstances of her colorful life but the situation she ends up in activates her inner warrior.
She endures and matures. She reconciled with her father and becomes father's daughter.My partner gave this movie 1/10 but I think that Crawl does not deserve such a terrible scoring fate.

Haha! It's all a bit overboard I agree!BUT!It's done for the purpose of giving you a nail biting movie obviously! And in rare occurrences they work!
Jaws was VERY successful......this film should be too as far as I'm concerned!So with that said, overlook the frenzied attitude of these Gators and appreciate it for its finer qualities!The acting is spot on! The tension is fantastic! There's also moments that make you jump like no other film in a while!

Throw in a generous amount of flooding and you got gators in your crawl space. Plenty of gator farms off the interstates too. Definitely adds a layer of creepiness for me.
The acting was pretty good. Kaya carried most of the film and did it well. My biggest complaint is seeing her attacked/bit so many times and be alive with all limbs fully intact.
The movie has plenty of the typical tropes but it's still entertaining. You're standing next to solid ground....Get away from the water already!

It doesn't have a real plot, but it doesn't need one.
It reminds of of the age of movies like Tremors. In fact, its similar to Tremors with a trapped feeling of Cujo mixed in.The fx were perfect for a horror film like this. The acting was great.

As many others have said, the script was very poor, and frustratingly, yet again another family member searching for another family member, which has become so tedious and done to death. The good thing was the dog. I liked that dog.Of more interest was the behind the scenes extra on the DVD. It was interesting how the set was constructed and how the actors and crew moved around in it. However, to me, the director, writers and actors are so delusional. For instance, the writers said that it was about a family coming together and that made it ""interesting"". Erm..no..every single disaster type has that storyline in it, and is now a dreaded cliché that steers a film up a predictable cul-de-sac. Sam Raimi talks about how realistic it is - what??!! The director claimed that by the end of the film the audience will know that the father and daughter will have a much closer relationship in the future. Did anyone think that? Not me, I was just glad when the film ended. I could write much more about these delusions and what they think an audience wants, but it would take too long. Sadly, I have heard the same delusions on many other 'extras' on DVDs of poor films.There is actually very little imagination on disaster/creature/horror films now, which is why they are all so similar.

477,TG22Film,Unerring intensity,7,5 November 2020,"This film has cult classic potential. Far from perfect, but its intensity is unmistakable. Hugely enjoyable - in a way it often felt less like a horror film and more like a Jurasssic Park style action film with all the suspense to boot. Saying that, there were moments that that clearly drew inspiration from Jaws.In spite of the alligators taking the spotlight at different points throughout the film, I was surprised to find the father/daughter element of this film is what drives the story. It adds a bit of emotion to the closing scenes, which is a neat touch where modern horror so often fails abysmally.Loved the first couple of alligator scenes. The later ones a bit less so. I will explain - there was an opportunity for a fantastic horror scene when the trio arrive on the boat outside that shop/service station. The girl is screaming as her legs are bitten into - and for a split second I was pretty terrified myself. Then they cut to someone else's death, which just felt like a goofy/spoof type death. So unnecessary! Sadly, moments like that can really impact on a film's fluency (which was otherwise very good). They should have stuck with the girl scene for longer - quality always triumphs over quantity in horror. That's why, in my view, slasher horrors tend to be so hokey.Anyway, in summary, very enjoyable film that doesn't outstay its welcome. A winning combination of intensity, suspense and a touch of emotion make this one worth your while! Just a shame that some of the death scenes weren't as good/effective as they could have been. Hmm..that makes me sound pretty twisted. But it's a pretty key trait of great horror flicks.",Crawl

I found it rather tame in comparison to his other films. However, it did have some tense scenes and it was fun to watch. I'm writing this in response to the bad reviews.

484,Charles_Carmichael,Expected more,2,18 August 2019,"Saw this as part of UK Cineworld Unlimited Secret Screening, hadn't heard anything about the film prior to this, and when saw Sam Raimi was involved, held out hope.Given the short run-time, the film is a slow exposition burn to the threat, from there, well it goes downhill in terms of story, sense and logic.You are expected to believe a human can out swim a fully grown alligator (and thats after being bitten on the arm and leg), that a fully grown alligator would not be able to break a shower door, that someone can after being bitten on the arm and not lose it (an alligator bite force is over 3500 pounds per square inch).The film relies on jump scares, which unless you have an extremely nervous disposition, you not be scared by as they are telegraphed badly.The most believable acting in the film came from the dogIs this film worth the ticket price, well no, wait for Netflix to show it",Crawl

No unnecesary boring opening scenes... It takes about 10-15 minutes that we actually seen the alligator(s) in the movie... Leading actress did a very good job, scenes very intense and Barry Pepper as supporting actor was good...

It's a well made 'B-movie'; very easy to keep up with, while not having too much storyline to follow. You care about the characters just enough to hope they escape the situation they find themselves in.On the other hand, the CGI is (at best) not the greatest, there's some classic horror movie, terrible decisions made by characters and at times the film does become ridiculous. No one ever attempts to explain why the gators are all so ludicrously pumped up. They are all seriously out for blood and will stop at nothing! As much as similar films like Deep Blue Sea were not great, they did explain why the sharks were so aggressive. Also, Barry Pepper has the highest pain threshold of any mortal man, if only he had his trusty sniper rifle!5.2 - Tense enough to view late night in the dark, but don't go out of your way to watch it!",Crawl

Its very average with a happy ending where they are able to escape in the end and be safe.Its a movie that you would watch once but beyond that there would be little to no interest because there is nothing redeeming about it. The gators are okay. They bite a few people. The dad gets the worst of it so you do get some graphic visuals. Which actually is the best part of the movie. Other than that you'll question moves made during the movie. But it wouldn't be a ""horror"" movie without questionably dumb things being done.You have time to pass with nothing to do it'll be okay.

497,jason_leo,Truly awful,2,26 September 2019,"It's rare that I find a film that looks so good and sucks so bad. The actors walk around like bumbling idiots doing the most stupid things which from the start is silly but goes on to be very annoying by the end. It was cringe enough that she happens to be a expert swimmer so she can swim 4x faster than any other human ever and outswim a load of alligators. This is after she has been bitten on her leg and bitten on her arm both of which would be broken. Apparently she is invincible but her dad sure isn't because everytime he is bitten he loses a limb or gets one broken. Also the relationship between her and her father is boring. It could have been a good movie if they had made it just a little bit more realistic . Example would be she calls her dad's phone. The phone should have been in the basement giving her a reason to go down there instead of it being on the side and she just deciding to. Plus when down there why is she crawling in muck when she can clearly stand? Make her step on a nail giving her a reason to crawl instead. Also how is the dad carrying a dog and walking on a broken leg while she carrys nothing next to him. If the director had some imagination he could have made a film that forces them to do things instead of them doing stupid things for no reason like going to the cellar etc.
Terrible film lacking imagination. It's a shame because visually it was good",Crawl
498,schmoab,Pretty good for summer 2019,7,18 July 2019,Warning spoiler review!This movie is an entertaining way to spend 90 minutes. Nothing in it is surprising and it really only has one jump scare. But it does something so few movies have managed to pull off this year-it increases in intensity up to the very end. Sort of like a boiling pot of gator stew that increases to a boil in the third act.The gore in this movie is pretty minimal and deaths are quick and painless. Jaws is much more frightening in this sense. This could have been PG-13 really. I say get some popcorn or maybe a beer and watch this on a hit afternoon at the theater.The first act is a bit boring but sets the stage well for the requisite family drama. Act 2 is basically an over the top piranha movie with gators. Act 3 feels very real when you think about what happens to people who try to ride out hurricanes. It becomes the Poseidon Adventure meets Happy Gilmore.,Crawl

501,wwejournalist,Claustrophobic but difficult to become 'submerged' in,5,10 June 2020,"I guess I must have missed something with this film, given it's average rating and being Tarantino's favourite film of 2019... but personally I found it to be a bit of slog that contained so many unbelievable aspects that it was impossible to become immersed in it fully.Where to begin?Well, we start by seeing swimmer Haley (Kaya Scodelario) falling just short in a race before a phone call with her sister that acts as a great big lump of exposition revealing:
Her place on the swim team is in jeopardyA Class 5 Hurricane is on the wayTheir dad (who Haley has fallen out with since her parents divorce) lives right in the path of the storm and they can't reach himInexplicably Haley decides to drive into the path of said Class 5 Hurricane to look for her dad, and after finding his dog abandoned she discovers he has been 'attacked' in the crawl space under their house.What ensues is just over an hour of trying to escape from the soon-to-be-flooded space while being pursued by... Alligators!Big CGI alligators to be precise.Sounds alright, doesn't it?The problem is it doesn't seem to know what it wants to be. One minute a tense thriller, then aspects of horror with blood and jump scares, then moments later its 10 minutes of touching drama as father and daughter discuss why their relationship is so fractured.I could have looked past that though, were it not for so many things that were ridiculous and immersion breaking.Just to pinpoint a few:When Haley first finds her dad he is unconscious his shoulder is ripped to shreds and there is a bone sticking out of his leg. About half way in he (rather gorily) splints up his leg and snaps the bone back into place. From that point on his mobility goes from 5% to about 90% for the rest of the film.Haley gets grabbed by the gators on at least 3 different occasions and seems to shake them off with relative ease (albeit with the help of a flare the last time), then suffer practically no ill effects. Yes she shows her leg all shredded up, but it doesn't seem to hinder her in any way.I don't profess to be an alligator expert, so perhaps this actually is how they would behave, but they seem overly motivated to kill any human that comes near. Jumping into boats, stalking people around a mini-mart and even leaping a good 6ft out of the water to grab someone at the top of a set of stairs.Not to mention creatures displaying this level of intelligence are stumped by some pipes, and can't figure out how to go around them or just smash through them given how large and powerful they are.Finally, there are sections of the crawl space that have been bricked over in a kind of hexagon pattern, with missing bricks presumably to let in light and air (and unfortunately in this case water). Having splinted his leg, Daddy finds a shovel and some pipe that he uses to distract and then fight one of the alligators with. I'm certain that these two items could have been used to jimmy loose the single bricks and create a hole big enough to escape through, but at no point is this attempted.But I digress. was Crawl a good film?Personally I found it slow and frustrating, but I can see why people would hold it in higher esteem than I do. It's all very well acted for the most part, the 'big bad' is definitely something to be frightened of and the sense of claustrophobia toward the end of the film works brilliantly... until something ridiculous snaps you out of it.I was going to give this a 4, but actually for all the things it does right a 5 feels more appropriate.I look forward to seeing Kaya Scodelario in more things going forward, as she did play her part excellently.",Crawl
502,craigschwier,"""We may be stubborn but we never give up""",5,29 April 2020,What is up with that statement made by the dad?You have to take this movie with a grain of salt.

504,rstarzecmoviecritic,You Know What You're Getting Into,7,17 July 2019,"Crawl is a good movie to watch if you want something simple to pass the time and make you tremble at the end of your seat from time to time. Basically, it is an R-rated B-movie that does not hold back on the carnage of alligator attacks at all. It is not trying to be a masterpiece like other horror films from this year (most notably Midsommar), and you know what? That is okay.Act one of this movie actually is not as bad as most B-movie introductions prove to be. We are introduced to a young woman athlete (a swimmer, perfect for a gator movie) named Hailey, who remembers from her childhood the words of her father when she failed to win at a swim meet, and those words are ""you are an apex predator."" Basically it does not matter if she wins or loses because Hailey is a fierce competitor, but they have to phrase it in a fun way because, you know, it is an alligator B-movie horror flick! Act one wraps up nicely in about twenty to twenty-five minutes once Hailey finds her dad injured at her childhood home during a hurricane and is caught off-guard when she discovers an alligator in the basement.You know how stories are more interesting when there is conflict involved? Well Crawl has a bunch of conflict sprinkled throughout the movie, most of which is either an alligator attacking somebody who can possibly help Hailey and her father, or an obstacle that Hailey and/or her dad faces as they are trying to avoid being torn apart by a giant reptile. This is a reason why horror movies tend to have mass appeal - they are loaded with conflict every which way, especially in a monster flick like Crawl.One problem with the movie is that it would be more exciting if some characters aside from Hailey and her father were better at fighting the alligator. The point of the alligator being able to devour people trying to help is meant to increase tension for the audience, but it would prove to be more fun if some of the human characters were able to put up more of a fight.This next point is not unexpected when thinking about B-movies in general, but man, some plot points and other aspects of the movie almost serve no purpose whatsoever. The writer or writers made it a point to include a dog in the movie named Sugar probably just so that we would constantly hope it is not harmed during the story. But here's the thing: for most of the movie, the dog is completely safe since it does not go down to the basement and is essentially nowhere near the water, so the alligator can't swim up to the dog. Also, there is a random shot in the movie focusing on eggs that the alligator has laid, and we see one baby alligator come from these eggs, but then we do not return to this at all later in the movie. It seems that might have been thrown in just to tease the possibility of a sequel.Basically with Crawl, the movie is exactly as advertised, which is both a good thing and a bad thing. If you're looking for a simple movie where humans fight a monster, this is a great one to turn to. However, don't be surprised if you come across some random plot points that do not get resolved later on. The movie is solid, and if you know it is not trying to be Oscar-caliber then you will probably have fun with it.7/10",Crawl

Haley (Scodelario) unreluctantly returns to their old house in search of her father (Pepper). With the water flooding them both in, they fight to survive against the alligators from hell.Surprisingly not a B movie here, CGI of the alligators were carefully crafted the storyline projected quite a scary scenario. It's like watching Jaws from when you were a kid and seeing this movie you'd be scared of seeing any forms of water again.Although the hero and heroine of this movie are probably immortal Gods that seemed to survive any loss of blood from being viciously attacked by the gators, it was an exciting movie all in all.Oh and kudos to the Director of this movie, the pet dog survived every inch of the disaster and did not have even one single scratch from the alligators.

Hell she even swam faster after being half eaten alive. That is not how that works at all unless your a competitive swimmer i guess.This house has the biggest crawlspace know to man. With its own subterranean cavern and ecosystem. Not to mention the excessive water pipes and a sewer drain you would see in prison movies.That has to be the strongest glass shower door ever made. It trapped a 500 pound raging alligator in it without breaking or even cracking one bit.

The start set a bit of context to Haley's life as a swimmer and then a big storm hits and she wants to get her Dad out of the storm. Gators then come and that's effectively it! The film was nicely paced but after a while when Haley's been bitten twice and still able to swim everywhere like it's nothing more than a scratch, I almost wanted the gators to get them by the end. Honestly think there was one ""jump"" scene where a police office gets taken by a gator, definitely a great horror film or even a horror film for that matter but if you like the idea of gators eating people then watch this. Everything is about swimming and Dave (Haley's Dad) will let you know about it! Dave also calls the younger Haley a ""apex predator"" which just foreshadows that's she's going to be better than the gators by the end of the film. Disappointing as the trailer looked good and very intense, was only another wannabe modern day horror film although the intense setting was consistent but not enough jump scares for an actual horror.",Crawl

515,jessfaith-45971,A Nifty Horror Film,9,28 July 2019,"Many horror or thriller films these days haven't lived up to their potential and are just trying to be cheap cash-grabs. There are some really good ones such as Us but many are flops. Crawl however, proves to be more than just a money maker. It has likable characters, a simple yet interesting plot and great visuals.From the tiniest details to the biggest ones, Crawl really takes advantage of its environment, using 1 main location. And it doesn't get boring. With great visuals, Crawl keeps the tension high. The tightness of the crawl space and the fear of a gator being around the corner are really felt in this movie. Something worth noting is how the characters used the simplest things to outwit their scaly enemies which added to the excitement.The two main characters were both enjoyable to watch and I felt the chemistry between the actors. Kaya Scodelario and Barry Pepper both bring heart-felt and strong performances. Their struggle to survive as well as rebuilding their bond was powerful and moving.The gators themselves were fun and cool to watch. Instead of having the gators always in the audience's face, the gators were often subtle and shown swimming, adding to the tension. There are some really good jump scares and I actually jumped a couple of times, something I rarely do. Thankfully, Crawl knows that jump scares can overstay their welcome and didn't rely on them too often. Some of the best scares came from the quiet moments when the characters were trying to avoid the gators.Overall, Crawl is horror film done right and it proves that movies don't need to be over the top or unrealistic to make someone squirm. From tense moments to great character building, Crawl cements itself as an enjoyable horror flick that I would definitely re-watch and highly recommend.",Crawl

There are alot of movies that fails just one of these factors but this movie I believe executes this very well. It's straight to the point but done so well with the visuals, the alligators them selves feel natural, way they move an attacks pack a lunch and has that none crunching feel that you want from a horror movie. Never a moment where you say ""you idiot what the hell, why would you do that"" the characters you feel for them.

522,rellik0078,Seriously Disappointed' Bad Story_Bad Characters,2,2 June 2020,Normally I don't like to spoil movies but believe me .just read this and you'll find out it's not worth watching but I am going to give you a small introduction into the details in this movie. It was a HUGE letdown. I was tempted to go see this in the movie theater when it first came out but I said no. I'm going to hold off because I can watch free movies once it comes out on my TV. Or I can go on a free movie video Site on my phone or iPad and stream movies for free if you know how.so I wait nearly a year to see this. I start too watch this movie. It was a 2 hour movie on TV. I skipped over the whole movie down to 30 minutes because many and I mean many parts of the movie were seriously DEAD BORING... this movie was a disaster. I have never been so disappointed in a movie. thank God I did not purchase a movie ticket for it. There was no good characters in this movie. Storyline was lame. I mean this movie did have good potential. it could have been a better movie if they had a better director that had a vision but basically what happens is this woman gets stuck in the house .her father goes down stairs which his down stairs is like a under ground fortress type thing. He gets unconscious somehow. downstairs in this underground basement type thing. The daughter can't find her father. she eventually goes down stairs where he is still unconscious. This big storm hits the city. the water starts to come into the house. Alligators or crocodiles get loose from the city. there's alligators or crocodiles circling both of them around this huge basement. and the woman has to find help or get help which there's no help..sooner or later the water starts going over their head or close too it. she finds this secret port or underground Port. she has to get through. She finally notices there are baby crocodiles or alligators moving in the water... basically that's about it. a 2-hour movie summed up in 2 mins...like I said. I don't want to go into too much detail about this movie because it's not worth talking about. some may find this movie the best movie ever made but for me as a huge moviegoer for horror and action. I would rather go watch lake placid or even the Shallows before This. Yes there is no movie out like this movie as far as being in one place for an entire movie.... The director could have done a better job as far as a vision and the only reason why I gave it 2 stars to begin with and that is being super generous is becuase of 2 things.1.the movie does keep you on the edge of your seat because you do not know where the crocodiles or alligators are. it keeps you wondering and thinking about when they are going to strike. and they could pop out at any moment...2. the basement is so huge there's so many tunnels that you can get lost real fast. it's like a maze that's about it.to end this review off about this movie. yes watch the movie once then get rid of it. never watch it again. throw it aside. move on to better movies like lake placid because this movie is definitely not even a 5 star movie. it's almost as bad as cult of Chucky or the new Remake child's play.... Not much more I could say.... Thanks.,Crawl

Skins, the amazing e4 show, introduced me to her as Effy, and I've always loved that show and her character. I have so many memories, both good and bad associated with that show. I was surprised to hear her with an American accent. She did a great job in this movie, and I thought her performance was believable and I empathized with her struggle.Barry Pepper has always given me a bit of a Alex Winter vibe, but is a good actor, and this was no exception. As a dad, I can't imagine the feeling of seeing your child in this much danger. I guess I can imagine, but hope never to experience it.This was honestly the best tension I've felt watching a film this year. Great jump scares, tense moments, good action, and reinforcement of why I usually try and stay as far away from Florida as possible.Good direction and cinematography as expected from Alex Aja.Overall, this was a really fun ride with some great performances, great tension, and some nice gore. This will be a purchase by me when it comes on Blu. Fun one to watch with the family too.8.25/10",Crawl

You know what you're getting from the opening scenes and it doesn't require too much thought, so just turn off the brain and enjoy the carnage.

I am a know-nothing simpleton but even the most casual observer will not be able to go 5 minutes without getting annoyed by things not making sense as long as you pay a little bit of attention.Perhaps the issue is that i expected a survival movie with realistic people trying to get out of a bad situation while this movie seems more inspired by shark-tornado.Even before it goes full on stupid at the last part of the movie there are still countless questions which ruins the movie for me
-What is the layout of the place?
-Where is the exit located?
-When are they safe or not safe from the alligators?
-Why not move to a safe place before making a phone call
-You have a spade, how about trying to break out via the wall or roof? (You later broke the roof with a crowbar in a matter of seconds)
-etc etcBut all of these questions are pointless because it goes full on crazy in the last part and clearly shows that this is all about flash and everyone who is watching it with their brains turned on is doing it wrong.Perhaps some people will like but it is not what i expected and i didn't like it.",Crawl

539,rguddu_india,"Decent attempt, with some obvious errors",5,5 September 2019,"A mix of hurricane movie (like Twister) and crocodile horror movie (like Lake Placid. Rather, more like Lake Placid-3 or 4). Some good action and moments satisfying our horror thirst. Good enough acting by lead actress playing a swimmer and lead actor playing her dad. Poor treatment of family background by sprinkling it at odd/insensitive moments throughout the movie. Poor/lacking CGI for a mainstream movie. Hurried/excess show of crocs, showing crocs as motivated stalkers rather than as animals with their own fears and sometimes nonchalance. Unrealistic girl-croc fights bordering on comic/superhero genre. Stupid/unrealistic decisions made by the characters. Cinematic convenience of when rescue appears.
Overall, I am happy to get a movie catering to my love for animal horror movies, disaster survival movies and hurricane movies. But it's disappointing that most of the errors were easily AVOIDABLE. I could think of the minor changes which could make this movie a 8/10, but now it is 5/10.

Let's just say that the movie isn't even over and we've both already mentally checked out. She actually apologized like she did something wrong to me. Everything about Crawl just meh. It's definitely not good, but it also doesn't fit into the category of ""So bad it's good"". It's in the same vein as a 47 Meters Down or Sharknado, but none of the fun, adventure, and inside jokes. Actually, now that I think about it, that is the perfect way to describe this movie. Imagine a version of Sharknado that took itself really seriously. It cast high profile, respectable actors. Then, instead of being funny, and doing over the top action sequences, you decide to have a plot about the fragile relationship between father and daughter, and try and pretend that all the CGI killer animals are a real threat. The ""neighborhood"" they live in is an obvious set piece, and CGI only gets worse throughout the product... I really don't get the point. Why cast such talented people and have them cry and bleed without any real stakes or believable situations? Why did these actors sign on? Why was a 27 year old mother (Kaya Scodelario) tapped to play a college swimmer with daddy issues? Why was it rated so high on Redbox and Imdb? Why am I typing a review? None of this works...

They stopped entertaining us in favor of pushing political agendas and anti-white narratives. I guess that is what you resort to when the creative juices stop flowing and you run out of ideas. It'd be funny if it wasn't so pathetic and frankly boring. I did laugh at this movie tho. A lot. It's just so stupid; gators be like nom nom while this girl is swimming around as though she has infinite breath control. I guess she is part mermaid or whatever. At least movies like Anaconda, Hard Rain, Daylight were entertaining. Just as silly and far out but interesting enough to keep you entertained with a decent script and watchable actors. Hell, even Waterworld is more entertaining and engaging than this. Put this movie on if you need background noise or something. It's frankly barely suitable for that. It's worse than Sharknado.

The problems came with the miraculous healing abilities of the two main characters, some pretty horrific injuries gained throughout yet shrugged off as if they'd just banged their knee. There was know need for this, especially as 3/4 way through there's a swimming race between gators and the female lead with a large open wound on her leg.
The minor characters were that minor, they had maybe a couple of lines, if the story lines of these had been expanded, and it had followed their exploits it would have impacted on their deaths, maybe even surprised you.

Given the entertainingly dangerous parameters of a hurricane flooding that traps a father and daughter in a house of scaled predators with an ongoing storm, director Alexandre Aja delivers to a plot that falsely reads redundant for appeared limited settings. Although Barry Pepper's character doesn't really look like Kaya Scodelario's character's dad, this mismatch is quickly forgotten with plenty of scaled action in succession. You start thinking how relatively proficient these two are in stressful situations as it pertains to reptilian care. The drama required for this direness is performed convincingly enough especially in Kaya's discourse, but the gem of the film is in the moments of attack - and there are enough chomping instances to make it worth the butter on your popcorn.",Crawl
578,tonynogueira,Why so much hate?,7,8 February 2020,"Ok, so for starters, out swimming an alligator is not realistic, we get it, but if your going to go by realistic elements in most movies, might as well only watch very slow dramas. This movie was entertaining, fun and suspenseful. The 2 leads were good, plot is simple enough but moves along with lots of alligator moments.
In regards to all the comments about the 2 leads getting attacked numerous times by alligators and getting away, again we get it, not realistic, but that is to grow the tension and make you believe the leads may not survive. Plus the entire true theme of this movie was the father/daughter relationship, the fact they are both stubborn but never give up, and their relationship has kind of suffered due to this, and this explains the drive they have especially once they are both together and need each other to push through.
This is an entertaining movie with tension and some gore too, if you are critical of small things in a movie, then probably not a movie for you, if you want to be entertained for 1.5 hours and not have to think too much this will do it.",Crawl
579,AGuyNamedJake,A Simple Back-to-Basics Horror/Thriller That Bites Hard!,8,13 September 2020,"""Crawl"" was one of my favorite movies of 2019, a delicious blend of mindless fun and gore with believable effects and gripping thrills. It's not a GREAT movie or anything, but it IS a refreshing one in a market over-saturated with superheroes, sequels, and talking animals. It's one of those sleeper hits that I think will stand the test of time.Director Alexandre Aja made a name for himself in 2010 when he directed ""Piranha 3D,"" a movie which garnered a lot of attention for two main things--one: being one of the first movies to use the gimmicky 3D trick effectively, and two: using that gimmicky 3D trick on boobs. Lots and lots of boobs. But Aja has also proven that he's capable of making a great horror thriller without relying on 3D or boobs, and he does so again with ""Crawl,"" just don't expect the same kind of silly schlock.Ok, sure, it has a couple of schlocky moments, but the excellent execution of those moments harkens back to Aja's more serious horror fare like ""High Tension,"" and ""The Hills Have Eyes."" In other words, this movie is definitely out to scare you.Kaya Scodelario plays Haley, a professional swimmer struggling to overcome self-doubt and a broken relationship with her father. When she and her dad get trapped in a basement that's flooding due to a Category 5 hurricane, they get a chance to reconcile--that is, if they don't get murdered by the man-eating crocodiles invading their home.Haley's inner journey through self-doubt and distrust is expertly interwoven throughout the script and Haley gets more than her fair share of chances to rise above her self-imposed limitations. It's brilliant character development that must be applauded in an age where too many female heroines are simply thrust into the height of their power without any real training, hardship, or character development. But Haley is given that and more as she becomes a sort of John McClain character who is just having a bad day in the wrong place at the wrong time. Oh, and she dies HARD! No, seriously, she should be dead after what she goes through. But, oh well. Flesh wounds, right?The scare factor is high because the threat isn't some CGI supervillain or supernatural serial killer, but a real down-to-earth terror that might just scare audiences because, well, it's real--albeit a tad exaggerated, but it's certainly something we all understand enough to fear. The alligators look great and provide enough menace and surprise to keep you on the edge in what is a very ""back-to-basics"" kind of movie. But in this case, less is actually more!In some ways ""Crawl"" is predictable and silly, yet it still manages to be a satisfying thriller with all the right atmosphere of a more mature horror movie. It pays a lot of homage to ""Jaws,"" even if it doesn't pack as much of a bite. Still, it'll take an arm or two!",Crawl

588,jakob-berge,Kaya Scodelario is basically Wonder Woman,6,8 January 2021,"A tenseful fast- paced thriller with good performances from Kaya Scodelario and Barry Pepper. It starts very well with some hints at what's coming, the way they set up the father-daughter relationship is also good. The cinematography is nice. The biggest problems for me is some extremely unrealistic scenes containing Kaya Scodelario and gators. There are at least three scenes where the gator takes a huge chunk at Kaya's leg and arms. It has it's full jaw around her arm and swings around. The creators of this movie clearly did no research around alligators. They have the most powerful bite ever measured for an animal. Kaya have to be an robot to have her arm and leg fully intact, and swim afterwards with seemingly no damage whatsoever. This annoyed me so much when this is not supposed to be an fun goofy movie. The rest of the movie is thrilling, it looks good, the sound editing is as you would expect and the performances from the main characters is what make you invest in their fates. That is why I get irritated when the writes does this leap of logics in the script.Some other criticisms, the supporting characters is dumb dumb dumb. Some people come to an overflowed gas station to steal an ATM. They supposedly live in Florida, know there are gators lurking in the water, and there are an stage 5 hurricane. But they just walk around the water and store like they are on the beach in the summer. Of course they get immediatly killed. Also there are some leap of logic in the script as well. Immediatly when they came out of the basement, I was sure they would get on the roof and wait for the rescue chopper. But the father forces her daughter to swim to the other side of the street, even though he knows she is injured and there are gators in the water? In the end they go to the roof though and gets saved. As for the alligators, in the close-ups I was dissapointed with the CGI. When they lurk in the background though, the lights and shade work well and there were some frightening images in the beginning.So while there are some unrealistic things happening and it gets too dumb sometimes, I enjoyed it. There was tension troughout the movie and maybe I overestimated the dark tone I thought they went for. The end credits played, «See you later, Alligator» after all...",Crawl

I have never seen this actress before, but her acting is definitely something to look out for in the future. Very on point and enthralling.There are quite a few bad points but are very minor. Scientifically, this movie does not hold up at all. Alligators are not as social as the movie led us to believe. They certainly don't hunt in packs. Wolves and lions hunt in packs, not alligators. With the only exception being in dry seasons, they may meet at waterholes, but they definitely do not coordinate their hunts. Being reptiles their hunting style are more passive, where in the movie,they are extremely aggressive and active, which is impossible, especially in storms. Thirdly, there is no way any female alligator will lay eggs in a passageway where mutiple adult alligators can pass through. Egg nests are usually very hard to find by other alligators.I understand if above facts were actually fixed there'd be no movie, but being an avid fan of nature documentaries, I had to point out these creative decisions.Also, rescue helicopters do not operate during a storm. There are regulations prevent pilots and rescuers become victims. Then rescue helicopter would only go out when the storm passes. The movie imply wanted to make people feel good.Otherwise, this was a very worthy experience of a budget movie.",Crawl

It's always seemed to be a thing as we've had so many great films like; Jaws,Jurassic Park, Arachnophobia, and even ridiculous yet fun films like, Congo, Lake Placid, Piranha 3d. This time around we have a film centered around people surviving a hurricane as well as vicious alligators.Director Alexander Aja knows how to set up some real tension, and after all he directed ""High Tension"", as well as the insanely great hills have eyes remake, and piranha 3d. The guy knows how to be brutal and bloody too at the right times. This all translates extremely well with Crawl. The plot is pretty simplistic and better off for it and lets us focus on the thrills of claustrophobic atmosphere with blood thirsty alligators closing in. Both actors thrive in their surroundings and give some nice performances. The camerawork above and underwater is magnificently executed and the alligator's look absolutely genuine and frightening. There are so many moments that come out of nowhere and shock the audience to where it doesn't feel derivative for the genre.

Why is that, you ask? Because, the lead ain't played by a muscular and slightly balding/entirely bald man would be my guess.It is the read thread in most of the 1-star reviews that the biggest flaw of the movie, is somehow a woman daring to survive situations that in reality are far less extreme and unrealistic than say, what John Wick or any Jason Statham character goes through...Meanwhile, she is not surviving anything that real life animals and even people, didn't survive before her. Look up Val Plumwood, for example.This movie is not terrible, not great. It's short and to the point, the special effects are far higher in quality than what I expected, and the violence isn't done excessively considering the animals involved.

The atmosphere is also great which is a huge plus. However the story kinda falls apart when you try to fit 2 hours of footage into 30 minutes. Movies tend to do this, only making the movie feel rushed and a bit messy. It has a very simple layout, and does not answer the questions it causes to rise. The ending reminded me of pet sematary, a very quick and fast phased ending to a slow phased movie. The audience is just waiting to get above the surface, and when it finally does, 90% of the movie is already lost to the basement scenario. It just doesnt hold up, and would have needed to be longer to work. The characters stupidity in this movie amazes me, even though they were good in terms of like-ability, they do make some very dumb decisions at some points, which causes frustration for the viewer. This is very sad, because they seem smart, but do the absolute worst decisions to get themselves into danger.

621,introv_loner20,"Intense, Suspenseful and Gory",7,14 July 2019,"To say that Crawl would be like The Meg, Jaws would be an understatement. The setting of the place, the environment, the performances of Kaya Scodelrio and Barry Pepper and the ever threats of alligators makes it uncomfortably frightening.The intensity is real because the threats and horrors that hurricane can unleashed on the land. You''d think it's only the rain, and wind. Add alligators who want nothing more than meat, it gets more thrilling and suspenseful. Add the fact that most of the movie happened in the crawlspace gives a sense of claustrophobia. the ever sense of being watched and attacked by the alligators with the rising water gives a sense of dread and hopelessness. You move and you are attacked. Help is completely out of reach, making it a hide and seek game with the gators.Among the things that made me like this movie is the environment. Imagine you are trapped in a hurricane place. The winds are strong, the rain is pouring and the ever rising floods are swimming with gators. In a claustrophobic crawlspace, you are cornered. The gore, jump scares are well place and emotionally justified with the atmosphere of dread and suspense. The performances too, were exceptional and made me believed that they are really experiencing the situation of their character. CGI is well used and good. The pacing too is good, though I feel at 87 minutes it is kind of short, and there could have been scenarios to lengthen the run time and fully take advantage of the premise. That's the criticism of Crawl.Overall, the suspense, the hurricane, the floods and the family drama (for character development?) made the movie good.

Stars Kaya Scodelario (""Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Vile and Evil"", The Maze Runner Series) and Barry Pepper (""Saving Private Ryan"", ""True Grit"", ""The Green Mile"") portray Haley and Dave Keller (Haley's Father) who become trapped in their old family home category 5 hurricane! A crappy situation to begin with, I'd be dead in seconds honestly, cuz this brother CAN'T SWIM! Anyways, Director Alexandre Aja (""The Hills Have Eyes"", ""Maniac"") livens things up by bringing in big mean green reptiles in the form of gators. There some pretty good special effects used to bring these beasts to life! Kaya and Barry do their characters tremendous justice! I really enjoyed this grounded thriller of humans vs. nature! There is a broken family subplot interwoven through the main narrative that is endearingly portrayed by both actors who display great chemistry! Barry is seasoned as you fellow movies buffs should know! It's Kaya who STEALS the show as the tough exterior, yet emotionally fragile Haley.

Now well, I'm still awake and here I am writing this review as this movie demanded my attention.As advertised this is one of the most suspenseful movies I've ever seen. There's a few things I thought like why didn't they try breaking through the floor, or are alligators really that bloodthirsty or that big but really what do I know about the build structure of houses in known storm/flood territory, and I've never been in gator infested flood waters. From animal planet I know average length of a gator is something like 10-12 feet but I have no idea what that looks like up close.The only reason I rate it shy of a 10 were very few moments which I felt sedimentary moments seemed a little forced and sometimes the gators looked pretty bad.

It had so many cliches... at the beginning of the film, she's 6 feet away from the exit of the basement (if she got to the exit, the rest of the movie wouldn't happen), and an alligator just HAPPENS to jump out at the exact right moment. But because of the music and camera angles, you total saw it coming. Both her and her dad get completely mangled, getting multiple limbs bitten and occasionally loosing them, but never become unconscious or die? This happens in every shark movie... all of the supporting characters die with one bite yet the main characters are able to endure countless. Also how on earth did the dad become unconscious from a scratch in his shoulder at the beginning, yet stayed conscious when his literal arm was bitten off?? The movie shows multiple supporting background people which you know right off the bat are only shown to be killed off. On top of all of that, apparently the main character can swim faster than the gators? And also all of the alligators are unrealistically big. In real life, most of them would MAYBE be 6 feet long... but they're like 15 feet long in this movie. These alligators are also way more smart/predatorial than in real life... they wouldn't be SEARCHING for humans after already eating like 5. It's the same as in shark movies... the sharks are always unrealistically trying to kill everyone... when in real life, sharks almost always kill humans on accident.

646,p_ortensie2005,It'll probably be on Netflix in 2 weeks,2,15 July 2019,"What I thought sucked (besides the fact that this was basically a really bad Netflix movie) was the lack of logic and common sense. They're trapped in a crawl space, yet they're along a wall where the outside of the house is visible, behind what looked like very thin brick. Which could have easily been broken with the shovel. Had they done that, they could have easily escaped. And been back to town before the storm really hit. Eventually they finally escape the crawl space, but instead of doing the smart/logical thing of trying to get on the roof and signal for help, they ignorantly decide to make a run for it (so to speak). But before their eventual escape, there was a scene early in the movie where some college age kids stole an ATM machine from a gas station and then loaded it onto a boat. All of a sudden a giant gator smashes through the back of the boat destroying it in the process and then the gator proceeds to eat a girl on the boat. Later in the movie after their eventual escape from the crawl space and then stupid attempt to make ""a run for it"" that same boat that was demolished by a giant gator is somehow in perfect condition, with the motor reattached when the main female character out swims a bunch of gators to reach the boat. And speaking of out swimming gators: the average Olympic swimmer averages about 5 mph in the water. An alligator averages 20 mph. So basically this movie had viewers believe that the girl had superhuman swimming abilities and could swim at an amazing rate of 25 mph. It wasn't just the acting that sucked. I didn't feel any connection to the actors, I didn't care if they lived or died. At one point, I began cheering for the gators, and laughed hysterically anytime someone did something stupid to get themselves eaten. The only character I cared for and wanted to survive was the little dog.",Crawl

Also super realistic that you don't know anything about the fact that there's a massive hurricane because you went to swim practice. Do you live under a rock?
Also impressive that you can walk and swim as if nothing has happened despite the fact that a gator has sunk its teeth into your arm and leg and dragged you around. Again, very realistic.Other people have described the flaws and inaccuracies in greater detail, so I'll just stick with saying that the movie is downright laughable and pretty much gets everything wrong about hurricanes and alligators.If you're up for a ridiculous, mindless ""horror"" movie, then go ahead.

654,elijahpitts-09626,A great suspense/horror movie,8,15 July 2019,"This movie reminded me so much of 2016 movie ""the shallows"". But the key difference between the two movies is that this one nails the character building that a suspense or horror movie needs to maintain to make you only interested in the ""killer"" killing. On that note Crawl also hits many slasher film keys, the main problem with most slasher movies is the main character is usually the villain which usually leads to poor development of the heroes/victims. Some movies break these problems like the scream series. Crawl luckily has pretty good main character development for a movie about alligators ripping people apart (which there is plenty of). Crawl has good CGI and script writing thanks to the Rasmussen brothers which have experience writing multiple horror movies before this. The cast does well enough for the movie, there are no Oscar winning performances but you should never walk into a new series suspense/horror movie and expect that. overall the movie was a very pleasant surprise, and while to me it felt extremely similar to ""The Shallows"" I recommend this movie over that or over any basic slasher film due to having characters we actually care about and still maintaining the suspense and blood/gore you want from these types of films.",Crawl
655,cogatlin,Not the worst movie ever but....,2,5 August 2019,"Let's start with the bad choices the characters made through the entire movie. I found myself hoping they'd both get eaten so the movie would be over. Since this wasn't an all out Sci-Fi fantasy movie, the script and plot points should have been more believable. Honestly, the movie would have been over in five minutes had Barry Pepper used that shovel to break through the floor above his head and then retrieved his daughter. I wasn't sure why they were trying to leave the house at all. I mean, by this point, they knew they were surrounded by alligators that had laughably unlimited stomach capacity, so why not take the dog and go upstairs to the roof and wait for help? Another thing, since when do helicopters fly in category 5 hurricanes? Next, the scene with the policeman's glock was absolutely ridiculous. There was literally no reason that his glock wouldn't fire in the condition the protagonist found it in. The first bullet fired into the alligator's throat would have killed it or, at the very least, made it swim away. Lastly, why were alligators hunting during a hurricane? Were they immune to all the severe weather and the debris that was floating and flying everywhere?! There were too many cheesy one-liners and forced pep talks between the two main characters. Lastly, the anti-climactic ending was the cherry on top of this fecal matter sundae. Fade to black, Really? No epilogue or anything?! Sheesh! Everyone in the theater had the same puzzled expression on their faces. I'd like to add that I'm a fan Barry Pepper's body of work and feel like he did the best he could with the script and direction that he was given.

This movie was exactly what I thought it was going to be for the most part, but surpassed my expectations visually. I gave this film a 68/100. What attributed to that was the story itself was a bit of a stretch in my opinion and too many things went wrong...even for a movie. I thought Kaya Scodelario was good as Hayley in this and she really made the movie.
A couple of things I also noticed..
1. The wind didn't blow Kaya Scodelario's hair outside in the hurricane in a couple of scenes.
2. I know this shouldn't have mattered but was the director trying to foreshadow the importance of Gators in Hayley's life by her attending The University of Florida? (This did not impact my score but just a thought.)
It did its job by keeping me entertained for a while but it was a little long. Every time you think something went right Hayley or the Dad makes a dumb decision..almost like every character in bad horror films.
The CGI was good and the underwater shots were astounding..when people were being attacked the blood was used well and they really sold the injuries.

This film seems out of character for him.We found ourselves shouting at the tv for various reasons and turned it off.I usually like to watch a film from start to end even if it's bad, but really couldn't with this one.Alligators eyes don't glow in the dark and they don't salivate as depicted in this, also first the bite from one there was no death roll, limb dismemberment and the women just shrugs it off.I'd rather watch deep blue sea or lake placid, Does that say a lot?Do yourself a favour and give this a miss.",Crawl

Anyone wondering how she lived? Well it's incredible because none of her limbs came off either. If crocs were notorious for bites like that and you come out fine and dandy, then I don't think they'd be feared so much.Then there's that other bit where she ""out swims"" 3 crocs!! Amazing for a girl who technically should be dead or have no arms or right leg.And then there's a plot twist where the girl finds a load of croc eggs (you see about a tenth of a second of a baby croc, that's it) but that's where that plot bit ends. Thought they'd go somewhere with that but it was just randomly added in the movie for no apparent reason.But saying all this, I was admittedly glued to the movie (except for the boring pathetic father-daughter moments where you're supposed to have a little bit more ""storyline"" to a movie than just a few crocs eating people).
But also the main thing is that they BOTH survived!! It really irritates the hell out of me when these people go to save their loved ones, only for them to of wasted their time as the loved one dies anyway.

The gators behaviour aside (I know it's a movie), being most of the film a dad and daughter duo in a single environment needs a really good chemistry and script but no. Kaya Scodelario is overreacting so bad in most of the scenes that gets from bad to worse, nothing against her but that 'heavy breathing' is really bad. And the script doesn't help either, it has some really weird decisions.
It needs to be mentioned that this movie mostly happens in a ¿middle? sized

I didn't expect too much but holy s**t did this movie let me down. While the acting was above average, the way the story unfolds just made me rip the hair off my head. You'll immediately notice that this movie has drawn some inspiration from Jaws. But it feels like a cheap ripoff of Jaws. With Gators.In a way, they could've named this movie Gattorado. At least then people wouldn't be going in with high expectations. Everything is there, except the tornado. There's a hurricane, but it's not the same. Some scenes were just so ridiculous I was actually laughing and wondering how could they have put that in the final product. The lead character makes so many obvious and cliche mistakes that made me question that I was actually watching a movie with a budget of over 13 millions dollars. Felt like one of those dirt cheap straight-to-dvd movies. There are also 2-3 jump scares that you'll be able to tell they are coming from a mile. I mean, if you've seen one or two of those other movies that were inspired by Jaws and the like, you've seen them all. There's nothing new or different in this one. Classical dumb characters making obviously dumb mistakes and they ultimately, somehow, pull through. LOLMy verdict: Just avoid it, not worth an hour and 27 minutes of your life.",Crawl
708,kidmetal-matheny,Crawling In My Skin,8,12 July 2019,"Crawl is most certainly what you would expect a film like this to be, but it isn't bad by any means, however it know's the nature of it's premise, and just goes for it. The intensity is genuine, and the gore/kills are well executed, and I do believe there are some pretty nice practical effects utilized throughout. The CGI on the Alligators is good, but sometimes (in the beginning of the film) looks shaky. The setting in a crawlspace during a hurricane is inherently claustrophobic in nature, and the film does play that up a fair amount. The pacing is excellent, and the ending is good even if a bit predictable.The acting by our two leads Haley Keller (Kaya Scodelario), and Dave Keller (Barry Pepper) is believable, and genuine, both do a great job with the father-daughter dynamic. There are some minor plot conveniences, and characters that are introduced just to die, but that can be overlooked due to the small scale nature of the story. It's a very self contained film aside from a hurricane ravaging Florida. There are a few ""jumpscares"", but they aren't dialed up to 11 like Annabelle: Comes Home for example.Overall, if you want a good modern ""creature feature"" that doesn't go above and beyond to makes itself feel absurd, and unrealistic. I'd recommend you check this film out, it was a surprisingly good time at the movies, and I walked out happy.I give Crawl, a 8/10. A fun time at the movies.",Crawl

711,zacoba,Beyond funny,3,2 July 2021,"I couldn't even laugh anymore half way into the movie. It was like watching the script being force-fed into a blender. If you think that Geico good choices television commercial about the teenagers in the horror movie represents good plot development, you'll love this movie:1. Why oh why didn't the protagonist grab her cell and take it (and herself) back to safety?2. I'm no alligator expert, but I would imagine that if you're in the water, and if a gator's close enough to see you, then they're close enough to bite you and probably kill you. Outswimming gators not once, not twice but over a dozen times? Really?3. A pet peeve of mine is characters not responding when they are called via walkie, phone, a yell, etc. Even in crisis situations most people respond to a query on their safety, if they're able. But in bad horror movies the mind's synapses all of a sudden slow down to a crawl (no pun intended) and what normally takes a second or two now takes forever. There are better ways of injecting suspense into a horror movie. Be more creative.4. Others have commented and I agree: both protagonists sustain a ridiculous amount of injuries from the gators yet continue to function like nothing's happened, with the exception of the final arm bite on the father. Speaking of fathers, this father breaks his leg early in the movie and still manages to *walk* around the basement, *walk*, carrying their dog, to the convenience store to grab the boat, *walk* up the stairs while fighting off a gator and *climb* out of the attic onto the roof and help pull his daughter up onto the roof with him. Am I missing something or was that not a complete leg break? A miracle?5. I discovered there are some crawl spaces in Florida - this changed my review from a 2 to a 3.I actually enjoy the Sharknado movie series *because* of their spoof-like quality and each movie having a film team that can poke fun at themselves. If the writer and director of this movie meant for it to be comedy-horror, then they missed the mark.

They're very klutzy - you can be right at its nose and it will snap, snap, snapity snap away, and most times miss.
Their bite is not so bad - you can get chomped and tossed about, and have a wound so minor that you can still get around just fine.
An alligator will just let go of you if you thrash around enough.
They're not very fast swimmers - slower than a human even.

Both of the lead roles play out of their minds and deliver unexpectedly incredible acting that puts you in their shoes.I've seen nearly every alligator movie you can name.

The atmosphere is notably above average for most movies, which I just love to see every single time it's present. But I feel as if more of the side-characters could've been needed or used. For example, in the trailers at least, the cop ""ex-boyfriend"" character for me was hyped up as a major character. Yet as soon as he re-appears he dies? I know he's a well known actor but c'mon. Also, they want you to care about the mom and sister but neither of them get little to no screen time, with even the mom having NO screen time. Also, the ending. This endinggggggg. I mean, it's not terrible if you see what I mean. But you can tell some corners had to definitely be cut as the ending just feels abrupt and out of place. With all these flaws aside, I still think the movie is good. The daughter and dad bonding here is top notch, the action is precise and entertaining, as I said the atmosphere is fantastic, overall it's definitely good overall. But, would I recommend it? Yeah, I would. This movie needs more attention as advertisements for it are far and wide. The movie theater I saw it at only had 13 people in it besides us watching it.

This movie is mistakenly labeled as a horror when in fact it's a thriller, action, and drama. If you think Cujo was scary, then this is also scary. When in reality it's a bore and disappointment.Main character is on a swim team. Braves a category 5 hurricane to find her father. Finds him wounded in a crawl space basement. Literally runs into crocodile.
Though the course of the movie the main character, Haley, is bitten on one leg and thrown around, smashed into walls that break with her ragdoll impression. But don't worry. She can walk and run on the leg that was chomped down on and subsequently used to toss her around. A little later she gets bitten on the arm -but the arm is okay of course-then bitten on the other arm and is put into a death roll. That arm is completely usable afterword.
The dad gets bitten on the shoulder and it's torn open. But he has full mobility. His leg gets a compound fracture. But he's able to tourniquet it up and then set it without losing consciousness. Then he's able to climb 2 sets of stairs before his arm literally gets torn off just above the elbow. Let's just survive that by tieing a shirt around the stub. Yup that stopped the bleeding. And then he's able to break open the ceiling and climb outside onto the roof and, on his back, use his one good like to drag his daughter up to the roof out of the waters of a category 5 hurricane that's able to pull the Crocs down the street.This movie is really a tragedy. That poor dog gets dragged into the whole mess by the daughter, is the one that located the dad three times for Haley, led an officer (who then got killed) to their location, sniffed her owner who drowns out from the kitchen floor so the daughter could pull him out and CPR .

The writing is terrible, the movie looks like an arcade game at times. The wide shots of the storm look fantastic. The close ups do-not. The acting is passable. The story is a total missed opportunity. Alligators don't attack people like this. They do not break through staircases, and attack you through piping. They do not gang up and attack you five at a time in the middle of a flood swallowing the entire town. The main girl, who looks confused the entire movie, stumbles around looking for her Dad for like 20 minutes (without any real substance) before she decides to go into a large crawl space, which is flooding, with rats on the floor, barefoot and in short shorts, in search of her Dad who just may have crawled down there... in a Hurricane. ""Only you Dad.""
This movie could take some serious tips from Jaws. Jaws had an actual plot. Spielberg did not want to show the shark until an hour in because he wanted to build the suspense. To not ""blow his load early"" to put it more crassly. Have we lowered out standards so much this movie deserves as high as a six? Or seven?

So I was curious as to why a creature feature since Jaws had such a high rotten tomatoes score. It was a typical horror creature feature film with the stupidest decisions anyone can possibly make, protagonist literally has her phone in hand and instead of going somewhere somewhat safer let's just call 911 here with a monster gator 5 feet away.And then let's fight off 2 Gators with my bare feet and a shovel, even after being mauled the protagonist is still somehow able to outswim a gator? She she swims faster than 15-20 mph? It was like watching a syfy channel film with a much better production value. Script is all over the place and the inclusion of characters just to be killed off just for a higher body count is just stupid.

775,derekmen-86753,"Alligators, and not much else.",2,12 July 2019,"Crawl was directed by Alexandre Aja and stars Kaya Scodelario, as a woman who goes to find her Father during a violent Category 5 Hurricane. During her search, she is ambushed by multiple killer Alligators, and must find a way to survive and find help in a city that is slowly becoming submerged in water. Alexandre Aja is responsible for films like The Hills Have Eyes, P2, and Piranha 3D all of which are not top tier horror by any stretch of the imagination. So that should give you an idea of what kind of movie this is. Usually, I love movies like this. Movies that know their premise is preposterous and just owns it. A lot of the time, it can be a fun, hilarious visit to the movie theater just picking a film like this apart. The problem is, that fun factor is unfortunately missing from Crawl. It does have a healthy helping of Alligator mayhem, so if you are looking for only that, you wont be disappointed. The Alligators are smart, fast, and menacing (despite some below average cgi) and truly pose a believable threat. But outside of the thrilling Alligator sequences, there isn't much here. The film seems to take itself way too seriously, and I think that is supposed to be the point, but it just didn't work for me. The main character was not likable at all, spouting off stale jokes and making decisions no regular human being would ever logically consider. And the dialogue was unbearably cringey. Attempts at character development falls flat, especially when characters decide its time to discuss family issues immediately following the vicious slaughter of another human being. Its just ridiculous. The movie does move at a generously brisk pace and is fairly short, so you'll hardly ever get the chance to be bored. The Dog and the Alligators are the only things saving this film. Don't waste your time, but if you do, you may want to take a few shots before seeing this one.",Crawl

Wounds are disappearing and severe injuries have no effect on the characters.
The girl gets bitten in her leg, crushed against the walls in the process, suffered minor injuries, her arm gets swallowed by a gator, swims on olympic+ level while the fathers shoulder gets borderline chopped of, drowns, runs around like normal with a broken leg, loses his arm which he handles perfectly fine.
Everyone else on the other hand gets killed by the very first attack, should have taken a bit of that immortality juice aswell.While the girls find herself in a death roll you get a flashback of her swimming...The animation of the gators are bad at times and physics don't apply to them. She can hold a door shut while a full size gator pushes on the other hand, just to hide in a shower with plastic walls. Gator can't get in and she manages to trap him inside a minute lator, he rams the shower wall which don't even vibrate a slightest little on the impact.Worst thing is, they hide half of the movie next to a Brille brick window where you have the feeling that you can even stare the walls down, yet noone thinks of tearing it down to escape.The movie has absolutely no character building. The introduction part was used to explain her swimming skills, then she directly drives into the hurricane, finds dad in the basement and gator appears in the same minute.Btw, since when do gators those gurgling noises? XDThis movie is a total mess, can't understand the high ratings, definetly deserved its 3/10Oh, did I say that she went to grab her mobile, saw the gator around the corner and decided to just sit there on the open to dial 911 instead of going back to safety and making a call there?

817,minecraftdude-76379,"Well, I liked it.",9,10 May 2020,"Crawl is about the furthest thing from high art I've ever witnessed. It's dumb, schlocky, wildly unrealistic and a hell of a lot of fun. I had an absolute blast watching it.People going in for a tense 'cat and mouse' movie with realistic character decisions will be wildly disappointed. If you go in enjoying camp, you will receive. Many people will point out glaring plot holes and unrealistic crocodile injuries and I agree, our protagonist's would've died by the 30 minute mark but does it matter at all? Sure, if a film is going to try and be a thoughtful, slow-burn think-piece with realistic characters then a tightly written plot does matter, but are you really going to try and critically pick apart a movie about killer alligators attacking a college student and her dad?I am confident the filmmakers knew what kind of film they were making and what kind of audience they wanted to cater for. Just by watching the trailer or reading the synopsis, people should've assumed this film was going to be the furthest thing from realistic.If you want mindless, schlocky and bloody entertainment, Crawl is the movie for you. It's fast-paced, well-acted, thoroughly exciting and suitably gory. (Sure, Kaya Scoldelario won't be praised for her great line-delivery but you can't deny the raw physicality she brings to the role.) Crawl delivers what it promises and if you go in expecting a B-movie, you'll have a great time.For the people who didn't like it, I'd recommend The Descent. It's a pretty different movie but has the same enclosed space, creature-feature atmosphere that you might be looking for. It's definitely the better movie but a lot less fun due to how harrowing it is. And to the people who liked Crawl, I'd recommend it as well. It's just a damn good movie.",Crawl

822,geet_phadnis,Gatorade for the masses,7,25 May 2020,"The Geets (Greats):The main protagonist gives a surprisingly good performance as Haley, who is struggling to cope with competitive Swimming. This is tested in a more primitive situation of 'kill-or-be-killed' where the film does a great job at blurring the lines in defining the 'apex predator'. It brings into context the 'fight or flight' response and how human beings are capable of over-performing in situations where their lives are in danger. The movie isolates this trait of humans by creating a sense of helplessness from emergency services and other locals, which further propels the protagonist to utilise her teachings to survive.This movie perfectly captures the relationship between humans, animals and nature. There is an on-going debate whether human beings are higher up in the natural hierarchy than animals or both are similar. This movie blurs this hierarchy suggesting that humans are capable of adapting to changing environments. However, more relevant to the plot, Haley's career and her Father's relentless push to make her carry out this career has purpose in a more primitive sense. Sometimes the things we learnt in the past which we devalued may actually be useful to u in the future.Haley's relationship to her Dad is also interesting and keeps the viewer 'hooked' as their relationship develops from distancing to emotional acceptability. The Daughter is angry at the Dad for forcing her into competitive Swimming from an early age and her subsequent failure to live up to this performance. It is only when this skill is put to the test in a survival situation that their re-connection blossoms with effectiveness.Despite the CGI the Alligators seemed authentic and it didn't seem 'fake'. In fact, the environment (Water, weather etc) helped create the sense of nature taking over the urban setting. The rise of the water from the crawl space until the roof of the house was excellently one to showcase this.The movie did a good job maintaining the tension from the start to the finish, which is rare for a movie of its sub-genre. The gradually worsening flooding and hurricane is excellently captured as is the 'osmotic gradient' created by these climatic events on the surrounding reptilian life.The film-makers and the main protagonists make excellent use of space. Most movies seem 'dried up' by constantly changing sets with poor use of each set. This movie delivers in this sense as all levels of the house is utilised making it feel as if the movie explores more than just character development and the natural environment. The house feels like an 'environment' on its own, like an enclosed stage. The actors feel the urge to escape from it but ultimately always end up back there.The Phads (Bads):This movie could have done with less minor characters. It seemed like all of their fates were sealed at the hands of a new 'natural order' which is being established in the urban setting. These minor characters felt misplaced in a movie which could rather focus more on the natural events unfolding and the interactions between the 2 protagonists.It seemed quite unrealistic how the Father survived the Alligator attack in the crawl space and survived. At the same time, it seems un-animalistic for the Alligator to not find a way to get to its prey more aggressively. Perhaps the movie would have more emotional investment from the main protagonist if she found her Father dead in the crawl space and the audience can watch the story unfold from there with the underlying theme of what lengths humans would go to survive despite major drawbacks.Aja continues to showcase his talents on a different aspect of the Horror genre. Despite this movie over-achieving within the 'creature-feature' sub genre, it will sadly be masked by Horror movies which appeal to the masses.",Crawl

832,ilenekoeppen,Dumb with a Lil' Bit of Fun,6,14 July 2019,"If you're wanting your fix of killer gators, natural disasters, and the bonding of a father and daughter - then you'll really enjoy this movie. If you're wanting an engaging horror natural disaster thriller, then this film falls a bit short.Swim racer Haley misses first place in a swim race, introducing both her skills as a fast swimmer and lack of confidence in herself due to her parents' divorce. When a category five hurricane hits, Haley ignores evacuation orders and searches for her dad. She finds him trapped and brutally injured down in his basement. As the storm worsens, the father and daughter fight to survive a threat more terrifying than the rising water.(SPOILERS AHEAD) While this story is predictable and too coincidental for its main characters (Haley being a fast swimmer, her father being a tools man), there are still some thrilling moments - and of course, plenty of blood and jump scares. The story arc is solid, with Haley regaining her confidence in her swimming and restoring her relationship with her dad. Any other characters introduced simply give exposition or offer a fun blood fest for the gators.Overall, for a movie where the bulk of the story takes place in a house during a hurricane, the story is just okay. I think we go into these kind of movies NOT for the story, right?The visuals and special effects are pretty good for a non-big-budget film. The effects of the hurricane feel real enough, and the bloody moments will scratch that itch for gore fans. While the CGI of the alligators isn't ""bad"", the occasional glint of yellow or the glowing red eyes in the dark make these creatures feel a little cartoony. Still, the best parts of this movie come from the alligators entering the scene. With the characters being in such a claustrophobic space, you join them in the suspense.In the end, there are some really fun parts in this movie. But there are also some really stupid parts (Haley being nicknamed the ""apex predator"" ever since she was a kid, the ex-boyfriend being easily killed, Haley uselessly getting to the boat). If you're really critical about movies, you'll also dislike the pacing, lack of character development, and lack of better thrills and chills. My ultimate suggestion: save your money and wait until this gets on a streaming service instead.BUT I will give this movie a bonus star just because my expectations were subverted by the dog not dying.",Crawl

834,dinosaurfruit,"Tense, claustrophobic, and definitely worth the watch.",8,15 July 2019,"Crawl is exactly what you would expect it to be based on the trailer and synopsis, but that's not necessarily a bad thing. While the film doesn't offer a ""New"" premise, the claustrophobic atmosphere and tension built by the combination of the storm and the Alligators does bring a new experience. The strongest part about this film are definitely the acting of the 2 lead characters. They manage to carry the intensity throughout the entire film, and don't bog it down with bad attempts of humor like many horror films tend to do these days. I can't give it a 10 however due to some unrealistic plot points , reliance on jump scares, and the film's length (Or lack thereof). The fact that Haley can apparently outswim an Alligator loses a lot of realism for me, and the constant jump scares at every tense moment really take away from the ""Horror"" themes for me.

Build up tension then make the audiance feel safe them bam jumpscare.While I ripped on it there this is still enjoyable. The acting is solid and towards the start it is effective at creating a sense of dread and while it gets less scarely towards the end it still gave me a sense of dreae. The acting is solid and I cared about the charectors. Halen is a solid example of a strong female charector. Strong but at that the same time weak to make you care about her. She isn't a mary sue which is really refreshing nowadays.Otherall this movie is predictable. And if you've seen anyother horror movie you'll see things coming from a miles away.

Including at one point, out swimming multiple alligators to get to a boat. Then finally, the left arm gets it and at the same time the alligator is delivering its ""death roll"" (the clue is in the name) But our main protagonist uses her previously bitten arm to pick up a flare, stab the gator in the eye and swim away.

The constant fear of something beneath the surface is apparent in almost every scene. The simple setting and plot do not detract in any way. This is a survival movie and it doesn't let up. Save for a few corny moments and expected situations that arise, this movie kept my interest. The cgi is exceptional for the most part. There are a few times where I could easily spot the cgi but again this doesn't detract from the overall experience. The alligators movements and appearance are what you'd expect them to be if they were in front of you. I loved the dreary setting, atmosphere and claustrophobic sense of dread this movie fills you with as the viewer. My only gripe would be in the way this movie uses the similar trope of treating every other character (except the leads) as having the collective brain power of a single cell amoeba.

868,lewismalin53,Worst film ive seen this year. Stay away!!!!!,3,29 July 2019,"Let me start off by saying this is not a Sam Raimi film he is just mierley a producer to this monstrosity of a film. This was an instant let down as the trailers advertised diffrently and as the actual director has an awful track record which has another film for his CV of atrocious films. I had this film on my list of films i wanted to see as i thought it would be good for a laugh but i couldn't even take that away from this film. The only reason this film has not scored lower is because of the bathroom scene which is on youtube which is about the only bit of creativity that the film has. Save yourself the hassle of watching this film and just watch the 5 minute clip and you will have seen the majority of the film.The film follows a woman called Haley and shes traumitised by believing that shes the cause of her mom and dad splitting up cause she was with her dad alot doing swim classes. So then after her dad dosent respond to her calls when a storm hits his she goes looking for him. She then finds him unconcious on the floor so brings him back around after an aligator almost gets her. Thats pretty much when the story ends and it just becomes a disaster movie with inconsequential actions followed by close calls. Theres so many times where an aligator has a full lock on either Haleys arm, leg or body but she gets up completely fine afterwards. Theres a point in the film where her dad comes back to life after being dead for a short while and within a minute hes back on his feet trying to escape. There are also multiple times they could escape by other means but instead they keep trying to manouver around the aligators to keep it high tension but it just gets frustrating after they have many ways to get out but they make it seem like they only have one or two ways out.Im not an expert in american architecture but theres massive degin floors in the house, which asks for a flood to completely destroy the house. The crawl space underneath the house was mig enough to squat/stand in but which we see later on in the film being done but at the start of the film they make her crawl eben though there is clearly enough space above her, i believe this was done just so the director could make the theme crawl play out thoughout the movie, but it simply dosent work and is forgotten about later on. The amount of water entering the house also depended on plot relivancy with no water in the crawl space to start off with and when the flood outside gets a foot higher suddenly the amount of water entering rapidly increases and there is no progression with speed it just changes within a snap of the fingers.You know when its a bad film when you care more about a dog that barks 95% of the movie over the humans who just felt very plain and very much like btec actors of ones they couldnt get to fill the role.This film follows no logic. I was lucky enough to see it at a secret unlimited screening to be able to recommend that you dont. If you see this review take it as fate as this will just end up having multiple sequels churned out just like sharknado.",Crawl

Like why do all these alligators keep biting off the limbs of humans? They're in a hurricane... there should be fish EVERYWHERE!! This movie makes alligators seem like demons of the natural world... no. Alligators rarely attack humans and in general they try to stay away from us. The concept is stupid.

To call this a horror film is absolutely laughable; it's nothing more than your run of the mill B movie thriller.Nothing about this movie was entertaining. The characters were dull as dishwater and dumber than a box of rocks. The actors were egregiously dreadful (especially the female lead - yikes). The script was just pitiful. Everything about the plot was predictable and inconsistent.And to top it all off, the believability of the entire scenario was ZERO. They had rescue boats and helicopters out in the middle of a category 5 hurricane. The storm water was perfectly clear. The teenage girl swam faster than an alligator. The protagonists got bit MULTIPLE times and survived, all while successfully running and swimming around with no real problem.By the end, I was rooting for the gators.

887,vaishnavbharathan,Crawl is an above average man versus wild movie.,7,30 August 2019,"Majority of the creature feature films follow a particular format when it comes to how the plot is dealt with and Crawl is no exception and is the latest addition to join that genre. This film doesn't deviate from the structure followed by many of the preceding films that we have seen and is primarily a predictable survival thriller. But the good thing about Crawl is that even with its clichéd route to its destination, the film doesn't fare badly as far as providing some thrills and creating a fearful atmosphere is concerned.A red alert is declared in Florida in anticipation of a fast approaching Category Five hurricane. Haley who is an aspiring swimmer in her college heads to the place of the hurricane since her father Dave is staying there. To her utter dismay, Haley finds her father lying unconscious in the basement of the house which has started flooding. And who accompany the duo in the basement are none other than some ferocious alligators. How the father and daughter get out after getting themselves trapped inside the basement of their home is what Crawl is all about.With just the two principal characters of Dave and Haley along with the attacking crocodiles in the thick of the action, the film sets up a good tension filled backdrop thereby creating some impactful scary scenes for the audience. Some of the sequences involving the creatures attacking Haley and Dave came out pretty well and created lot of impact. All of the computer graphic images of the alligators were surprisingly good enough and the scenes showing the outskirts of the city bearing the brunt of the hurricane and getting flooded too were nicely created. Kaya and Barry Pepper who enacted the roles of Halle and Dave respectively put up decent performances to support the narrative.Crawl is an above average man versus wild movie with a predictable storyline. But the thrills and horrifying mood that it follow keeps it engaged from the start till the finish line. If the usual jump-scare factor is taken out of picture, this one is a worthy choice for those audience who have an leaning towards creature/survival/disaster films.",Crawl

Even he wasn't stupid enough to go down there.Where do I buy the armour skin as she was bitten by an alligator on the leg and still running around like an athlete.If the farther was under the house boarding it up for the storm considering the actual way the house is designed it was bound to get flooded anyway so for humanities sake he wasn't really worth saving in the first place.Helicopter's flying around in a hurricane wow ok I'm not even a pilot and I know that wouldn't be a great idea.Ok she can swim faster than an alligator.. good for her.I failed high school and can barely add 3 and 3 together but even I thought this movie was beyond garbage.

Going back to the roots of creature features, this movie is very entertaining and a good popcorn film to watch during the hot summer days. Alexandre Aja is back with another great thriller. Pros for the movie are the pacing, the CGI, and the overall story arc that the two main characters go through. Some of the cons for the movie are some of the logic issues and decisions that characters make throughout the film.

I recognize that this is a thriller and they had to add the killer gators to make it interesting but being honest, I think the writers confused alligators with crocodiles.Also, why would they go to the boat after getting out of the crawl space? You have a second story home and every person from florida knows to go to the attic and break open the roof. Duh! I can excuse the rest of their actions in the movie but that one I cant understand.I guess I should start taking swimming lessons since a human can out swim an alligator now!Levees in Florida are not like the ones in New Orleans. Storm surges would have been the accurate term for all the flooding.I also think they could have made the movie more realistic (and even cooler) if they had more accurate wind. The eye of the storm? The hurricane is the strongest surrounding the eye. They could have really played with that.Overall, I didnt hate this movie. It was fun and well acted! Some stuff they got right, others they didnt but I understand that the writers needed to make the movie interesting by turning up the Florida stereotypes by x10.

If you choose this movie its probably because you like movies with alligators chasing people which it has a lot of. That part is good, the part of the movie that is not so good is the characters/actors. They're really irritating. I'm not a fan of Barry Pepper and whoever plays his daughter. Awful dialogue, things were said that wouldn't be said if you were really in that situation but I suppose that's with every movie. I think Barry Pepper's character called the alligators pea-brained lizards or something like that, really stupid dialogue.

No, humans wouldn't survive being attacked by gigantic gators in a small spaces more than once. I could go on and on. It's unrealistic. But it's entertainment! And it's unique which I appreciate. We have plenty of movies about serial killers and backroads and murders and monsters and aliens. What we didn't have was a movie about a father and daughter trapped in a Florida crawl space surrounded by alligators during a hurricane. Don't count the plot holes and don't focus on the cheesiness.

First and foremost, there are NO crawlspaces or basements in Fla. There are very few cities where this is an exception. She tells her sister she is driving 2 hrs south on I75 from UF so that puts her squarely in Tampa. There are NO crawl spaces. None, zip, zilch, nada!!! The house is not definitely not a style found in Fla. And even the garage door is a dead giveaway. And there are no levees in Tampa. Girl gets told by her sister that there's a cat 5 currently hitting Fla and she's shocked, shocked I tell you! She would have had a week's advance notice at minimum. With all channels on 24/7 with the hurricane's path. And they would have certainly cancelled a swim meet with a hurricane a minute away! On to the actors. B movie actors, acting in a D script. Has all the hallmarks of a SyFy movie, but with a much weaker production value. Girl gets mauled in the leg by gator. She gets up and starts running! She wouldn't even be standing, but no, Forrest starts running! Gets mauled in the arm later, then starts swimming like Michael Phelps. Later still, girl swimming 5mph outswims 3 gators swimming 20mph. Gets mauled a 3rd time, with a death roll. Managed to keep that arm, then climb like an olympic climber. She's ready for the Gold! Also, Cat 5's have a minimum of 157 mph winds. In this movie, the wind was barely blowing. You would not even be able to stand in a cat 5, let alone float around in a makeshift raft or steal and ATM in a jon boat! And there is almost never thunder and lightning, but for some reason in this movie there was some every few minutes. Other stupid stuff: Eggs take 65 days to hatch, but eggs just laid there earlier that day start hatching. Gators over 9 ft are rare, but in this movie 20 ft seems to be the norm.

Horror movies these days rarely include animals and if they do they're not very effective yet this movie manged to provide some intensity and strike some fear utilizing the old movie staple of man eating animals (in this case gators). It was a fun watch and judged by what it attempts to do it clearly excels. One could expect a bunch of eye rolling moments based on the premise but there honestly weren't that many. Sure some of the ""characters"" make some bizarre choices to help the movie keep going and to ensure you understand how bloodthirsty the creatures are but the two man actors do their job quite well and it's easy enough to suspend disbelief and have a good time.If you want some action with a hint of horror I say give this one a watch.",Crawl

Hollywood over pumping noises, tension that is not really there.For me, this is insult for animals, insult for people, ...It's watchable, with loud commenting: ""Yea, right, yea right,..""Waste of great effects on environment.As someone said, if you read this and would like to watch it, just forget about reality and watch this with empty head, just try, otherwise you will write 1 star comment too, I couldn't help it.Major flaws, major gaps,....If above house is everything under water, how come that under the house is not?
If pipe is almost 1 meter above ground, how is that not enough for 0.3meter ... to pass under?
If horizontal pipe is under water from one side and not under water on other side, how is that called except miracle?
Crock are blind, ow wait, let's see what wiki says:""Crocodiles can see underwater due to a transparent lid that closes over their eye to protect it. They also have excellent night vision, due to a specialised retina, as well as a good sense of smell."" You will remember that one, crocs are not blind, even if you stand still.
Wow they have great vision, great smell, so how come they are all blind and dull on smell in this ""great"" movie?
One more fact:""Crocodilian sense of smell is also very well developed, aiding them to detect prey or animal carcasses that are either on land or in water, from far away.""
And another:""They respond to the slightest disturbance in surface water, detecting vibrations and small pressure changes as small as a single drop.""
And another:""Crocodiles can hear well; their tympanic membranes are concealed by flat flaps that may be raised or lowered by muscles.""
And yet they are blind and deaf in this movie.But for real, did you know that they could live ""forever"", theoretically? :) I didn't so thanks for this movie, I have read more facts about crocs, than I did in my whole life, but still, you should not watch it...I bet somebody counted all mistakes and flaws, and I bet that this movie has more than 50!",Crawl

1001,betamigos-moviereviews,Crocodiles In The Basement!,5,31 July 2019,"At the most recent Cineworld 'secret unlimited screening' we queuing cinema goers filed politely into the screen, speculating upon what film we might be about to see. My money was on Hobbs & Shaw, though it could be the new Quentin Tarrantino (Once Upon A Time in Hollywood), or more disturbingly the Dora The Explorer movie. But no, it was film about crocodiles* in the basement.(*yes, I know they are alligators)Crawl, I had heard of but only in name. When it started, there appeared to be only two names in the credits. The first, Kaya Scodelario, although known by most as that girl from Skins, I had seen only in the most recent/worst rated Pirates of The Caribbean film Salazar's Revenge (or Dead Men Tell No Tales, as it was better named for the US release) and had faith in her abilities as a lead. The second name (Barry Pepper) did not mean much to me but more on him later.What I did spot early doors was the producer, none other than Sam Raimi. The man behind The Evil Dead Trilogy (and for three entries in the Spider-series) this was surely a safe pair of hands or at least a stamp of approval and gave me the feeling that this was going to be leaning in the direction of a classic horror and or slasher-style flic from yesteryear.It certainly started with all the hallmarks of a film from said genre. The girl from Skins is a semi-professional swimmer it seems, and along with shots of her pushing herself (physically) to do better at the swimming we get some flash backs of what we assume is her dad pushing her (mentally) to do better at the swimming. 'What are you?' He asks in that way that dad characters do in films. 'I am the Apex Predator' the child version of the girl from Skins replies, in a line that we all know will make a comeback later on in the film.
Post swim, girl from Skins (or 'Haley', to give her character name) goes off to get her, as we now find out, somewhat estranged father at the behest of her sister. A big storm is coming in and he'll probably get trapped in his house if he's not out of there soon! Haley ignores advice of officials on the road and head's to dads, but he's not there? Maybe he's gone to their childhood home, closer it seems to the weather danger-zone. Well his trucks there, but where is he?As Haley searches the house you are willing her to find something supernatural or at the very least potentially scary or gruesome and so when the first jump-scare comes, it's affective. Sadly the very mundane truth is that the dad is in the crawl space under the house rather than in another dimension or mutated into a giant moth and so down we go to what will essentially be the setting for the rest of the film.Dad appears to be fatally wounded (something he seems to get over thanks to a mouthful of rainwater, a wipe of the face and a splint made from a screwdriver) but how did this happen? There are a few moments before the sad truth arrives where you are still holding out for an ungodly demon of some sort, or at least a deranged serial killer. But no, an alligator crashes into the film destroying both the protagonists exit (the stairs) and our own hopes for the movie.The rest of the film plays out pretty much how you would expect (especially if you've watched the trailer which tells you EVERYTHING) with our alligator antagonists (altagonists?) munching through everything and everyone, though still sparing the family dog, surely the tastiest bite size snack for the gator on the go. Roland Emmerich would be proud.There are plot holes a giant alligator could swim through of course. Both of our two heroes sustain pretty life threatening injuries early doors, which in real life would result in them being dead within half an hour or certainly unconscious. They not only power-through but in later scenes, the injuries appear to have all but disappeared altogether.On the plus side, there are some moments of genuine tension, Kaya Scodelario is pretty solid, she can pulls off the American accent effortlessly and makes some of the weaker, predictable dialogue work for her. Barry Pepper who was troubling familiar (I later realised I knew him from Saving Private Ryan) was generally sound as the dead-beat (and nearly beaten dead) dad, again pushing out trite lines that wouldn't have been out of place in a daytime soap opera.The stars are of course the alligators. They are surprisingly realistic, assuming they are all but computer generated (unless they chucked the two main players in with some actual gators, just for added realism) and like all good movies villains a part of you is willing them to succeed, or at the very least take a good chunk out of someone.The issue I have, and it is my issue, is I am not sure why (or indeed how) this movie exists in 2019. It is a clear throwback to the 'giant animal in the sewer' movie tropes of the mid to late 90s, though thanks to some good CG, good acting and some genuine moments of tension it is lifted above films like Anaconda or Alligator (and way above the likes of Sharknados, thank god). Even if it isn't quite Snake on a Plane.But in a year that has given us great horror films like Jordan Peele's Us and Midsommar (which admittedly I am still yet to see) alongside your actual blockbusters like Avengers: End Game, I don't know how this film is expected to 'survive'. It is actually quite surprising that it has even hit the cinemas when it really has straight to Netflix written all over it. I am glad that it has in many ways, it's not the greatest film in the world or even in its genre. It is what it is and I happily sat through to see what fate had in store for this girl who can apparently swim faster than alligators. Its only 83 minutes, it's a bit of fun and you could do a lot worse.Oh and the end credit's song is clearly a result of someone typing 'songs with alligators in the title' into google! It will make you smile I guarantee it.RATING: 5/10",Crawl
1002,craigm6764-923-450320,Terrible Movie,2,26 September 2019,"I enjoy a good man vs animal movie and have enjoyed several low budget 3/10 type ones but this was truly awful.The thing that killed it for me was apparently you can be mauled by an alligator several times and just walk it off! for example in one scene an alligator has her entire arm in its mouth biting and pulling and she manages to get free and then spends the rest of the film with not a mark or bruise on her arm! someones leg gets broken as in snapped bone but has no trouble walking on it what so ever, an am also gets ripped off and apparently if you just tie it off you don't pass out or go into shock or die of blood loss you can just crack on like nothing happened.It was an ok movie but that fact that injuries that would have definitely have killed you where ignored meant for me that the alligators didn't actually pose any real danger so I didn't care about the story or the ending.",Crawl
1003,gracyhr,How non-Floridians enjoyed this is beyond me,5,2 January 2020,"I'd like to begin by stating that this is the most ""Florida"" movie I've ever seen. As a native Floridian, I personally found it quite entertaining despite its major plot holes and demonization of alligators. Native Floridians are likely to enjoy this film. They'll recognize the billboards advertising gator farms, existence of hurricane parties, and they'll understand that UF has one of the best swim teams in the country. I would imagine that non-Floridians would find this movie extremely confusing. Keep that in mind if you're debating whether or not to watch.",Crawl

1005,jgrowel,I felt like I have seen this movie before but with sharks or something.,4,13 July 2019,I knew most of this movie was going to take place in a confined area and it did. Not really creative and unrealistic. The alligators portrayed in this movie were way over the top and I guess if you want to waste $12 bucks go a head. How this movie got a 6.9 shows that the critics get it wrong a lot. One part in the movie they see 5 alligators in the water but decided to walk through it anyways towards a boat. Then the girl who is a college swimmer in a way out swims an alligator. Way over the top and not believable. Go see yesterday.,Crawl

1007,acgreen56,This movie is hot garbage,1,23 July 2019,I honestly was so mad at the constant awful choices made by every single one of the characters. All of them choose to make the worst choices based on their situation. This was single handedly the worst movie I have seen in many years.,Crawl
1008,jleritter792,"Cool concept, terrible execution",1,27 October 2019,"My bf and I are both from Florida... myself being from Collier County. We are used to hurricanes, seeing alligators everywhere, and torrential downpours all times of the day. This movie was a cool concept and, it being based in Florida, we both were excited to see it. We were both highly disappointed. First off, no ""crawl space"" in Florida is going to be big enough for you to stand up in and have a full sized gator swimming around freely in. First off....that was a basement, which is incredibly rare to see in the Sunshine State. Second, if you get bit by a gator, think of it as an aquatic bulldog. It will not let go, especially not from a 110-lb. Swimmer hitting it in the face with her foot. You get bit, you lost whatever limb it latched onto. Also, how was the water coming into the house like that prior to it flooding up to the roof? No drainpipe system in Florida is going to lead into a house big enough for an ALLIGATOR TO MISTAKENLY SWIM INTO YOUR HOME. They are also not nearly as prevokingly violent as this movie made them out to be. The radio wouldn't be playing tunes while a cat 5 storm is over the town, there would be weather alerts and that's kinda it. The gas station (which Bannon's is nothing either of us had ever head of) would not have power until the end of the freaking movie. Helicopters and poilce would not be out in the middle of a storm like that. Nothing would be flying in the air like that until the storm had passed. Levees don't hold an entire ocean's worth of water like that to flood the area to the rooftops. I could go on but we are actually MAD about how much this film sucked. Don't waste your time or money buying/renting this if you haven't already. I seriously don't know how in the world it got such good reviews. This was fake swampy garbage. Who films a movie based in Florida in Serbia?",Crawl

1010,jordanmarshall-37523,How do people enjoy this?,3,23 July 2020,"I don't really write reviews, but this movie is insanely overrated even at a 6. Nothing in this movie makes sense and goes beyond requiring you to suspend disbelief for a movie. My points will include spoilers.Let's start with the simple things. First, I don't care if you're Michael Phelps, you aren't out swimming 15 alligators, so if you're a college girl, you CERTAINLY aren't. 2nd, alligators only hunt by splashes now? The alligator killed the cop standing outside the basement, he wasn't even in the water to splash. 3rd, so the boat the alligator jumped into to kill a looter is now a safe haven for the main characters because the alligators can't get to them? 4th, I don't think alligators just swim away after 5 seconds of not being able to get to you through FLIMSY water pipes in a basement. 5th, the dad has a gushing shoulder wound, a bone coming out of his leg, and gets an arm eaten and he's still conscious and alive? 6th, why are the alligators suddenly afraid to walk on land when they had already been before the flood even happened? THE GIRL SURVIVES A DEATH ROLL FROM AN ALLIGATOR AND NOT ONLY SURVIVES, HAS THE AWARENESS TO GRAB A FLARE AND STAB IT DIRECTLY IN THE EYE. Why is there a helicopter flying into a hurricane bad enough to go from ankle deep water to the roof of a two story house in the matter of 2 hours? Lastly, why do the alligators bust out of random walls and windows like they're boulders from Crash Bandicoot? All of it is just so stupid.",Crawl

1015,fabiana-BR88,It's um... a movie,5,16 December 2019,"Crawl is the perfect definition of average. Firstly, I have to admit. There are some thrilling and breathtaking scenes and the premise of the movie is quite interesting, so in my opinion, the movie wasn't bad. Nevertheless, there are quite a few plot holes. Let's just cite a few.Her father doesn't answer his phone and is probably in danger right where a category 5 hurricane hits. Should she, an unprepared person, look for help first or venture to find him by herself? ""Nah, I'm going straight into the storm with nobody's help"".One more very noticeable inconsistency. Would someone call 911 as soon as they grab their phone, or would they immediately get to a safe place first? Just safely put your phone in your pocket and get the hell out of there! It makes absolutely no sense to try and make a phone call if there might be a freaking gator just around the corner. Now her phone is a goner. Genius.Would you like a few more? Ok. I'm pretty sure alligators can smell blood. But somehow, in the movie, their prey managed to stay hidden and stand still within inches from a gator while it swam past. Also, these reptiles swim faster than humans but again, somehow the latter were able to outswim them. Nice.The acting was average. The main character's facial expression when she was frightened was weird, to say the least.In conclusion, would I recommend for you to pay to watch Crawl in the theaters? Nope! Should you watch it at home to pass the time? Sure, why not? Because flaws aside, it was an entertaining movie for me, as I said. But would I watch it again? Definitely not.",Crawl

The acting is bearable for the most part.
Now for the problems with this movie. Everybody acts like absolute idiots. They constantly make the wrong choices even when it's obvious what they should do. Of course this is to make the movie exciting, you're supposed to be scared for what will happen to the characters next. But this is just lazy writing. It gets tiring when every time the characters manage to get out of a scary situation with the gators they just put themselves willingly in a new one.
And the same behavior goes for the gators. They do not follow their natural instincts in this movie and instead is written absolutely dumb. They can't smell blood. They bite but do not hold on, instead they just nibble a bit and then let go. And they swim slower than humans under water. It's like the creators of this movie did zero research on gators. This just breaks all immersion in this movie and what could have been a cool creature movie just becomes pure camp.
If you have a nice home-theater then maybe give it a rental for the sound and visuals. Otherwise avoid.If you want to see a similar movie like this that is actually good then check out Rogue (2008)",Crawl
