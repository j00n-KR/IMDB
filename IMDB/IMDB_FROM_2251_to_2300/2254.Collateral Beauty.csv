0,TheLittleSongbird,"Hardly an ugly duckling, lacking in too many areas to be considered a beauty",5,30 May 2017,"'Collateral Beauty' is one of those films that was critically derided, critical reception was not kind to it, but has garnered a more polarising reaction from people commenting on this site.Seeing 'Collateral Beauty' without any prejudice, despite having knowledge of its negative critical reception the cast is such a great one with plenty of talented names, to me it was nowhere near as bad as critics have made out. It is a hugely flawed film and many of the critics' criticisms are on point, but there are far worse films around and is not bad enough to be one of the year's worst, it is nowhere near either among the worst work of anybody in the cast (for example Will Smith has never done a worse film than 2013's 'After Earth'). There are some good points here, that can be recognised by me, but can people seriously start expressing their opinion without resorting to critic bashing, conspiracy theories or insulting anybody with a different opinion to theirs, it is getting incredibly annoying and has gotten way out of control in the past decade.The best thing about 'Collateral Beauty' is the cast. Will Smith is understated and stoic, but also charismatic and affecting. Helen Mirren seems to be really enjoying herself and provides a few fun quotes, while Kate Winslet, Michael Pena, Keira Knightley and Edward Norton make much of little. 'Collateral Beauty' is beautifully filmed, atmospherically lit and crisply edited, and the soundtrack is not too intrusive, nor is it too low-key to be non-descript.Some genuinely beautiful and touching moments too, though they don't come consistently and actually come too far and between.Unfortunately, 'Collateral Beauty' is hugely flawed. It is very muddled tonally, with what it was trying to be raising some question marks (basically a drama but it seemed to try and do other things too that didn't mesh), as a result of trying to do too much and not doing much with most of it. There are pacing issues here, due to some scenes going on for too long and a few of them being little more than filler the film does have a tendency to drag.It was very difficult to identity with the main character's plight properly, because the character is too mysterious to the extent that he is underdeveloped and one-note. Many of the other characters are also underwritten. The script is also unfocused and sees some horrendously stilted and forced dialogue with overdone emotional moments and jarring comedic touches. The ending leaves a sour taste in the mouth, it lays it on so thick with the platitudinous schmaltz that emotionally it feels manipulative, meanwhile the final twist is laughable.Overall, not as bad as it has been made out but hugely flawed and not a particularly good, let alone great, film. It does feel like this is going to be an unpopular review, like one going out on a limb, judging from the defensive and condescending tone of many of the positive reviews. 5/10 Bethany Cox",Collateral Beauty
1,SnoopyStyle,left me cold,4,21 October 2017,"Howard Inlet (Will Smith) has been a zombie since losing his daughter two years earlier. He spends all of his time putting up domino chains and knocking them down. His business partners Whit (Edward Norton), Claire (Kate Winslet), and Simon (Michael Peña) are concerned. They would like to sell the company but Howard owns 60%. Whit is divorced struggling to connect with his daughter. They recover a letter he wrote to Love, Time, and Death. Whit is taken with Amy (Keira Knightley) and follows her to her acting group. The partners come up with an idea for Amy and two of her acting friends Brigitte (Helen Mirren) and Raffi (Jacob Latimore) to portray Love, Time, and Death to 'gaslight' Howard.Will Smith is doing a depressed low energy guy. The three partners' motives are questionable at best. The three actors are acting obsessed and callous. I can't attach to anybody. It all leaves me cold and then there is a final twist reveal. The twist only accentuates how fake and artificial the story had been. It is all contrived and manufactured emotions. The only way to truly do this is to follow Howard's point of view. At least, that has a chance for the audience to empathize with him. The audience can discover the hiring of the three actors along with Howard. The twist reveal could be truly shocking and the movie can even do a double twist if it wishes. Despite the stellar cast, this is a sad, tiresome watch.",Collateral Beauty
2,Horst_In_Translation,Neither beautiful nor ugly I would say,4,21 May 2017,"""Collateral Beauty"" is an American movie from 2016 that runs for roughly 95 minutes and was directed by short film Oscar winner David Frankel. If you take a look at the cast here (Smith, Winslet, Norton, Mirren, Knightley...) you have a bunch of actors who can carry a strong script alone on their shoulders. But sadly this is exactly what even five of them need: a strong script. And while there are some okay moments here, I would not necessarily say that the screenplay is really on a level here where it is good enough to really make for a good, let alone great, movie. It is an ultimate sob story I would say because every character here has basically one factor that makes their life tragic for whatever reason. Be it terminal cancer, the impossibility to become a mother, a bad father-child relationship - you name it. And then there is of course the central character played by Smith who is fighting his inner demons here as the father of a deceased girl who has stopped being part of the outside world and just lives life for himself. So his friends, played by some of the actors I mentioned, try to find ideas how to help him. They know that Smith's character writers letters to recipients like death, time etc. so what is their idea? Have these phenomenons respond to him. This is maybe the worst component of the entire movie action-wise. Imagine you have a dear friend who is emotionally very unstable since losing a loved one. What do you do? You send a woman disguised as death to him and pretend nobody except him can see her. Honestly, I would have expected the poor guy to completely go insane, but the somewhat bizarre result of it all is that for whatever reason he goes to a group of parents who lost their children to talk about it. Doesn't make sense to be honest.Completely aside from the protagonist, these struggles for the supporting players emotion-wise felt rushed in and just for the sake of it, so that every audience member should be so deeply affected by at least one of the bunch, perhaps through personal experience. It's a bit on the cheap side I must say. And what was it with these characters disappearing on the bridge at the very end? Does it mean they never existed? Or was it just for the sake of effects? I have no idea, but it sure was a bit on the pretentious side. So overall, this was really a missed opportunity, but honestly can you be surprised? After all, here we have the writer from stuff like ""Just Go with It"" and some other fairly weak romantic comedies, so from that perspective one must perhaps say that the expectations were fulfilled with this 2016 movies. The title is also a bit on the pretentious side and the way it was included was in theory not bad, but the crucial scene at the very end mostly including Mirren's character was not half as effective as it could have been unfortunately with the decent build-up. Quite a pity and also there are more than just a few moments that felt random and unrealistic. So yeah, I would not say this film is a trainwreck like many do, but it is also nowhere near the level it could have been. Just another pretty forgettable 2016 movie and definitely a wasted opportunity looking at the cast. Pure Oscar bait for Smith too and maybe one or two supporting players that did not work out at all. I have to give it a thumbs-down. Not recommended.",Collateral Beauty
3,Prismark10,Concussion,2,1 March 2017,"Will Smith might had got away with it in the film Seven Pounds but he had no need to return to this well again for Collateral Beauty.The film has a Twilight Zone type reveal at the end, by which point the film has fallen of the cliff.Will Smith plays Howard a charismatic advertising agency boss who we see giving his staff an inspirational pep talk at the start of the film.We then go forward three years later where Howard is in the dark depths of depression after the death of his six year old daughter. His business is going down the drain as lucrative ad contracts are getting terminated and his partners are worried. They include Whit (Ed Norton) Claire (Kate Winslet) and Simon (Michael Pena) who all have been waiting patiently for Howard to snap out of it and all tried to help out in whatever ways they could. They also have problems of their own such as Whit having been through a messy divorce has a daughter who does not want know him and Simon facing a serious illness.The three executives hatch a bizarre elaborate plan by calling in a private investigator to at least salvage the future of the company somehow. They then get actors from a theatrical company to bother Howard by portraying the spirits of love, death and time after they discovered some letters Howard has written to these existential beings.So these three actors now pop out of nowhere to talk to Howard, the private investigator films them and even makes out that no one else can see these beings and that Howard is talking to himself.Strangely the actors playing the spirit help resolve issues that the executives who hired them have. Such as Helen Mirren who portrays the spirit of death brings solace to Simon as we see his health deteriorating.There is also a ludicrous side plot where Howard finally goes to a bereavement group meeting and gets to talk to Naomie Harris who runs it and she seems to have success in getting through to Howard, however the viewer might be left with a feeling of drowning in treacle with this particular story.The film is mawkish, sentimental rubbish with an all star cast. If I was Simon facing death myself and unable to leave something to my family because the business could collapse as my fellow partner cannot move on from the death of his daughter. I would had given Howard a left hook.",Collateral Beauty
4,nogodnomasters,I'm gifting you,10,8 August 2017,"Howard (Will Smith) owns 60% of an ad agency. When his daughter dies, Howard goes off the deep end for years causing the agency to lose accounts. With the agency is about to fail, a generous buyout is on the table. However, Howard won't discuss the matter. Three employees develop a plan of competency for Howard, while at the same time give him shock therapy by having actors visit Howard as Death (Helen Mirren), Time (Jacob Latimore) and Love (Keira Knightley) like the ghosts that visited Scrooge. What makes the film clever is that each of the three employees have serious issues themselves with death, time, and love.The film deals with the grief of a lost child so it is guaranteed to be a tear-jerker. I had initially thought the film should be 4 stars until I watched the double twists or surprises at the end which I admit I thought were clever and changed the whole complexion of the film. Heart warming clever drama.Guide: No sex or nudity. I did hear Time utter a quick F-word",Collateral Beauty
5,kosmasp,Weird feel good (?) drama,6,3 July 2019,"Great cast and I would argue everyone is doing their best. The movie though has quite a few cliche traps - especially towards the end. Actually with an ending that ... well might break the movie for some watching. I'm guessing the negative reviews (at least some of them) had to do with that.Other than that, we have a Will Smith as a broken down person. With so many people around him that care, that you do wonder how and why he even needs more help. That is if you don't get that helping a person mentally is more than just difficult. But there is a selective ... view on things. That may make you question what you just witnessed (sorry for the puns, you might get them if you watch the movie). It also depends on if you can believe ""drama"" Will Smith - do you buy it when he is sad instead of happy go lucky? It's a tough sell and borderline at moments. He is a good actor overall but I would argue that he falls short in some critical moments. They are still good moments, because they are written well ... So overall decent and depending on your view on (after)life and other things you may like it more than others",Collateral Beauty
6,Sleepin_Dragon,"It doesn't get much love, but I thoroughly enjoyed it.",8,2 September 2019,"This kept reminding me of A Christmas Carol, with the central figure visited by three ghosts, our central figure, namely Will Smith, is visited by three beings, all sent, to turn his life around.I've not found a great deal of love for this film, and that surprises me, I very much enjoyed it. It had me moved to tears. The ending in particular hit hard.A great story, with some terrific performances, a terrific cast, including Helen Mirren and Kate Winslet. Despite the names, I must give full credit to Will Smith, the best performance I've seen from him to date, he had me choked up.",Collateral Beauty
7,lee_eisenberg,everyone needs to make a connection,6,7 August 2017,"I understand that the critics panned David Frankel's ""Collateral Beauty"". I didn't find it to be a great movie, but I didn't think that it was a bad one. I guess that the point that it was making is that social isolation can't be a lifestyle, even for an executive. Will Smith plays a role quite different from the ones with which we usually associate him (he probably wanted to show that he can be more than just the cool dude in action flicks).I found the characters played by Helen Mirren, Kate Winslet and Keira Knightley to be the most interesting ones in the movie. Naomie Harris played a good role here, but her performance wasn't as strong as in ""Moonlight"". Overall, I'd say that the cast did its best with the material that it got given.Basically, it's an OK movie. Not one that I'd recommend over anything else, though.PS: David Frankel also did ""The Devil Wears Prada"" and ""The Big Year"".",Collateral Beauty
8,Quinoa1984,one of the worst screenplays Hollywood has produced this century,1,26 December 2016,"Grief is crippling and grief can really take people to the woodshed who otherwise thought they were strong. A close family member of mine lost their father when still quite young (both she and the father), and it devastated her and changed the dynamic of the family. But what happened after this? What else could she do? She got back up, went back to work, and tried to move on with her life, with the grief always there in the background at the least. Maybe some people aren't so lucky. If one were to watch Collateral Beauty it would seem like the only logical thing to do when one's child dies is to become a zombie that has a penchant for reenacting the pastime of setting up dominoes to fall. Does it have some symbolic relevance? Who cares? Doesn't it look SYMBOLY, though? F*** this movie.This is what some Hollywood hack - who seems to have a thing for writing the lessor vehicles for Jennifer Aniston, Sandler and Kevin James (and what does that tell you) - think is ""deep"". This is not at all what the trailer said it was, but, frankly, I knew that going in. I read a few reviews and I knew that there could be, or would be, something revolting in the execution of the story of what is essentially a gas-lighting: three 'friends' of a man who really needs to be committed to a mental hospital (and I don't mean that in a bad way, sometimes people really do need many years of therapy) decide to hire actors so that their boss/co-founder of this ad firm, played by Smith, can be declared incompetent so that the business can keep going on without him.What I had hoped for was, also frankly, that perhaps the performances could liven things up or that maybe there could be some genuine levity or humor to off-set the major tragedy going on inside this protagonist (ala Manchester by the Sea, which was already a tremendous work of art and now, compared to this, is like the deepest, darkest, most meaningful Ingmar Bergman film compared to this). Nope. This is grief porn. This is a filmmaker taking what is most offensively a LAZY script - the proof of this is that we don't get to know Howard really at all, to actually be *shown* it, before it cuts ahead to him being the Griefing Dead, and instead are told this over and over by Norton, Winslet and Pena to other people and to themselves - and trying to make it ""mean"" something through the magic of clichéd music and terrible ""characterizations"" for the actors who really are the stars more than Smith (this may also be the writing too, it's honestly such a horrible script that had I been a reader for it I would've used it for the old 'poop on fire on a porch' gag - actually, that's offensive to poop).This premise doesn't make much sense, nor how it's executed. How do other people not see the other actors around Howard (there's supposed to be one exception when the P.I. following Howard, who also discovers these letters written to the abstract concepts)? Why would they show the video of Howard ""talking to himself"" in front of other board members, or even just one, and not worry about, gee, I don't know, being found out as frauds pulling a con game on their partner and friend, and not even a good one? But more than this is that every time ""Death"", ""Time"" and ""Love"" come to confront Howard, everything they say is so saccharine and lame and the kind of words that make Hallmark cards rip themselves up with scissors.I wish I could even point to one thing here that I liked. Mirren I suppose isn't terrible, and Smith, Dog bless him, is trying to bring something to a character that is, even by the end, just a walking dry-mop of a man (until the inevitable break through of course). It might just be saccharine and forgettable if not for how aggressively terrible it is in every department of its storytelling: poorly/under-developed characters, actors who should know better (Kate Winslet, shame on you!), and taking a premise that could be a twisted thriller or even a horror movie of sorts in other hands and instead force us to like characters who are both understandable in their terribleness (sure, I'd want my boss/partner out too if he did nothing all day, dead child be damned, and if my job was on the line) and yet still terrible all the same.It's morally bankrupt in how it wants to come sit at the grief table, but doesn't do the actual dramatic work of earning the sentiment. It takes what actually happens to people who are grieving and in pain and makes it into something that is some kind of distraction or abstraction - my grief isn't like Will Smith's, after all, he can live comfortably and healthy despite his numerous responsibilities, and we don't need to really get to know his co-workers or anyone past their surface-level problems or issues. And on top of everything else, after not one but two wretched 'twists' near the end that aren't since you can see them coming ten miles away, it tries to shoehorn in Christmas and the holidays too because, sure, throw more kindling to this monstrous dumpster fire.As the New York Times' Vincent Canby was fond of saying of Heaven's Gate: AN UNQUALIFIED DISASTER!",Collateral Beauty
9,studioAT,"Well intentioned, but misses the mark",3,25 June 2017,"This film is to its credit trying to do an awful lot of things, and it's got a nice objective of trying to be a modern Christmas fable.Ssdly though despite the best efforts of a seemingly endless list of big name actors, the film starts slowly, and is then playing catch up in terms of trying to regain the audience's attention after that.It's all a bit overly sentimental, it's all a bit slow, and for those reasons I didn't really get into this film, despite me really wanting to.I understand that the critics had a field day being negative about it, and that's a shame, because it's a well intentioned film.",Collateral Beauty
10,sunwarrior13,A Complete Disaster,1,13 September 2019,"Will Smith together with a star-studded cast that includes Edward Norton,who rarely appears on movies nowadays being a difficult-to-work with actor,together with Kate Winslet,Helen Mirren,Mark Pena,Keira Knightley, Michael Pena, and Noami Harris in this film entitled,""Collateral Beauty"". It tells a story of an advertising executive who treated from life after experiencing a tragedy. His friends help him in order to help him to get back from his depressed state and become the same person again.Despite having a great cast,the film completely fails as it lacks a story and the execution of the plot was disastrous. Added to that,we also see how implausible it was as the people involved - the advertising executive and his friends - are able to control reality and are not susceptible to any circumstances at all. While the friends' intention were great, the execution of the film was done poorly. It only appeared to be both cheesy and melodramatic. It tried to evoke tears among the viewers but the lies that the friends do will prevent it from doing so.In summary,it was a complete disaster.",Collateral Beauty

12,oscaralbert,Warner Bros. warns America of the dangers of . . .,9,3 January 2017,". . . Snail Mail in this tragic story of COLLATERAL BEAUTY. Warner documents how it may take as little as $800 to cut a master key to all the blue metal U.S. Postal Service sidewalk drop boxes in New York City, so that your business colleagues or rivals can joke about your personal correspondence--or, worse yet--use the privileged information contained therein to wreak havoc with your personal life and destroy the firm for which you've slaved your entire working career. Will Smith runs the full gamut of Human Emotions from Sad to Weepy as the main victim of COLLATERAL BEAUTY's mail fraud scam, so it's likely that Will's Real Life Wife Jada will get Sad Will a Best Actor Oscar Nom, as well as garnering Weepy Will a Best Supporting Actor Nod.

13,neil-476,Much to recommend it,8,16 May 2018,"Howard (Will Smith) is a high-powered and committed ad executive, driven by the interaction between Love, Time and Death. When his daughter dies, there is nothing left in Howard's life. He writes letters to Love, Time and Death, but doesn't function at work any more, leaving his three partners at a loss as to how to save the business crashing. When Death, Time and Love turn up in person and respond to Howard's letters, will this provide him with a way out of his grief?The first thing to mention is that this is another film which leaves a key plot element out of the trailer - indeed, in some respects, the trailer is downright misleading - and the developments from this element are one of the joys of this movie. Parallels are drawn between the personifications of Death (Helen Mirren), Time (Jacob Latimore) and Love (Keira Knightley) and the circumstances of Howard's partners (Michael Pena, Kate Winslet and Edward Norton), who have personal issues with Death, Time and Love at their hearts.But even without that wrinkle, the movie is highly engaging. The script is good. It may not ring with resounding wordplay, but it is constantly thoughtful and thought-provoking and - surprisingly given that the film's overpowering theme is bereavement - it is often quite amusing.Naomie Harris plays the leader of a Child Bereavement self-help group which Howard eventually attends after loitering outside on numerous occasions, and maybe she will be able to help him make sense of these meetings with individuals who may - or may not - be figments of his imagination. The movie plays with fantastic elements while never losing site of the raw reality of bereavement which lies at its core.It's not fair to say that the film resolves Howard's issues - that would indeed be glib - but the film does resolve itself, and there is a degree of glibness in how it does so.Even so, the film tackles a difficult subject and does so in an engaging and compassionate way, entertains throughout its length, and leaves you with much to mull over in quiet contemplation or in empassioned conversation.An unusually thoughtful and intelligent movie.",Collateral Beauty
14,HotToastyRag,Moving and tender,9,6 June 2019,"Collateral Beauty bombed at the box office, but it's a fantastic movie. It's also extremely heavy and will make you go through an entire Kleenex box, so that might be why audiences didn't flock to the theaters to see it. Whenever you're in the mood for a good cry, rent a copy. The acting is wonderful and the story is intriguing and original.Will Smith stars as a grieving man whose life has fallen apart. His friends and business partners Kate Winslet, Michael Pena, and Edward Norton are worried about him, and they try to help him, in a very bizarre way. They hire three unemployed actors, Keira Knightley, Helen Mirren, and Jacob Latimore, to play Love, Death, and Time. They tell the actors how Will is grieving and they think with a spiritual intervention, he could get his life back on track.This film is so moving, clever, and emotional, and the all-star cast gives lovely layered performances. When given the opportunity to show his dramatic talents, Will Smith is always wonderful, so get ready for another display of raw emotions. It's a bit of a running joke in my house that I'm not the biggest Helen Mirren fan, but I love her in this movie. She's clever and doesn't ham up being a struggling actor, but instead makes the audience feel they're eavesdropping on her private conversations. Keira Knightley, whom I love, is tender and expressive, just as her character needs to be. In one of my favorite scenes, she approaches Will in a restaurant, sits at his table, and as her eyes well with tears, she declares, ""I am Love.""Rent this movie. Sure, it's an indie flick, but it doesn't feel like it. It's one of the better movies to come out of 2016.",Collateral Beauty
15,gradyharp,'Death is so much more vital than Time. Death gives Time all of its value.',10,11 August 2017,"Letters to Love, Time, and Death – that is the simple message that opens this illuminating and insightful and philosophically rewarding film as written with consummate skill by Allan Loeb and directed with respect and taste by David Frankel. It is an investigation of life, love, death, grief, and recovery – a film that will most assuredly bring solace to those who have lost close loved ones while preparing all of us to look at the process of life and death in a more resonant manner.When successful New York advertising executive Howard (Will Smith) suffers a great tragedy (the death of his 6 year old daughter), he retreats from life. While his concerned friends and co-workers Whit (Edward Norton), Claire (Kate Winslet), and Simon (Michael Peña) try desperately to reconnect with him, he seeks answers from the universe by writing letters to Love, Time and Death. Engaging an investigator (Ann Dowd) to watch Howard, his friends and co-workers discover a troop of actors – Helen Mirren, Keira Knightly and Jacob Latimore – to impersonate Death, Love, and Life. Howard begins to open, attends meetings with other victims of loss (including the radiant Naomie Harris), but it's not until his notes bring unexpected personal responses that he begins to understand how these constants interlock in a life fully lived, and how even the deepest loss can reveal moments of meaning and beauty.The acting is extraordinarily fine from the entire cast, the musical score by Theodore Shapiro enhances and never detracts from the mood of the film, and the cinematography by Maryse Alberti is sensitive. Highly recommended on every level.",Collateral Beauty

I thought I was going to be in for a treat but at the end the movie is just disappointing. It only deserves a five because of the cast. That's the only thing that didn't fail in this movie. You have a bunch of real good actors, like Helen Mirren, Edward Norton, Will Smith, Kate Winslet and others but that's not a guarantee for a good movie. You need a good story and this one is just poorly written. Maybe if you are a parent that lost a child you might find some comfort in this movie but otherwise it's just not good enough. The whole writing to and meeting Death, Time and Love thing is just ridiculous. It's one of those American movies where you supposed to learn a life lesson. But I don't need life lessons, and certainly not about a subject like this one, so besides the excellent cast this movie is just not good enough.",Collateral Beauty
17,Hellmant,I guarantee most viewers will like!,9,29 December 2016,"'COLLATERAL BEAUTY': Four and a Half Stars (Out of Five)A drama about a man who tries to deal with the tragic death of his young daughter, by writing letters to Love, Death and Time. The movie stars Will Smith, Edward Norton, Kate Winslet, Michael Pena, Naomie Harris, Helen Mirren, Keira Knightley and Jacob Latimore. It was directed by David Frankel (who also helmed the 2008 sentimental dog flick 'MARLEY & ME'), and it was scripted by Allan Loeb (who's mainly just written silly comedies before this). The film has received mostly negative reviews from critics, and it's disappointed at the Box Office (so far); but theatergoers, who have seen it, all rave about it (mostly). I loved it as well. Howard Inlet (Smith) is a successful advertising executive, in New York, who's life takes a sudden turn for the worse, when his daughter (Alyssa Cheatham) dies. Howard becomes completely depressed, introverted and somewhat suicidal. His business partners (Norton, Winslet and Pena) all fear for his mental (and physical) health; as well as the well-being of their company. When the trio learns that Howard has been writing letters to Death, Time and Love, they decide to do something drastic. I found the film to be very cleverly written (with some pretty surprising twists throughout), and it's superbly acted as well (especially by Smith). Yes, it is very sentimental, and it is an intentional tearjerker, but it does those things very well. If you're not moved by this movie, I'm afraid you probably don't have a heart, or a soul (just like most film critics). It's a great movie, that I guarantee most viewers will like!Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://youtu.be/B4EI2AvkLgo",Collateral Beauty
18,lesleyharris30,"Spiritually Enlightening,",8,12 January 2017,"Collateral Beauty is a great movie with a very well developed plot and a stellar cast. This is receiving diabolical reviews from critics, and if I was to ask why, I would imagine they were not open enough to truly understand it's message. It is sort of like poetry, in the sense that you will not appreciate a poem you do not understand, there are a lot of complicated elements to this film, plenty of unexpected turns throughout. That all is a message in conveying the massive effect people have on our lives, how love, time and death is the key elements to any person. I would have appreciated some flashbacks, that was the only major downfall for me, it would have served the plot very well to have actually seen Will Smith spending time with his daughter before her passing. It would have made the audience more connected to the character and give us a better understanding of what he is going through. The cast is phenomenal and it saddens me that they may not be receiving any credit that they deserve. Smith, Edward Norton, Kate Winslet, Michael Peña, Helen Mirren, Naomie Harris, Keira Knightley and Jacob Latimore all come together to tell a complicated, layered story in which all of them had great arch's, with each character being developed subtly through warm and sincere dialogue. I walked in with low expectations, and I came out with a smile on my face, delighted with what I had viewed, there is truly nothing like it, and I am not afraid to admit I was in tears. Sweet, meaningful and very complicated, the trailers will make it seem basic but there is a lot more to it, Collateral Beauty is worth the watch for anyone looking for a good drama.

19,capone666,The Vidiot Reviews...,5,11 March 2017,"Collateral BeautyLosing someone is very difficult, especially when they didn't tell you any of their online passwords.Fortunately, the deceased in this drama was too young to have that many PINs.Spiraling into depression after losing his daughter, ad executive Howard (Will Smith) starts penning angry letters to Love, Death and Time.When his business partners (Edward Norton, Kate Winslet, Michael Peña) discover this they hire actors (Keira Knightley, Helen Mirren, Jacob Latimore) to portray those concepts and confront Howard publicly.However, their scheme to get him deemed insane makes them reevaluate their own feelings towards those intangibles.A failed attempt at an uplifting ensemble, the hokey premise gets more pathetic and laughable as it limps towards to its overemotional ending.

20,tabuno,Emotionally penetrating drama,9,28 January 2019,"This emotionally penetrating drama while focusing on the intense bereavement of Wil Smith's character also incorporates three parallel personal stories of three other characters. The movie echoes some of Wil Smith's earlier dramatic mystery from Seven Pounds (2008). The first third of the movie carefully, though somewhat oddly balances a surprisingly, well- crafted wry sense of humor in some of the dialogue which also subsequently oddly dissipates. Not an easy movie to watch, Collateral Beauty offers nevertheless up a rather mystical tone reminiscent of The Fisher King (1991), K-Pa (2001) that allows the audience to experiencing both deep sadness as wells as curiosity. In the superb fashion of Nomad (1986) and Picnic at Hanging Rock (1975), director David Frankel achieves a fine ambivalence as the nature of the movie' ultimate genre that Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close (2011) chose not to follow but with still glowing satisfaction. The movie hits hard on one of the most profound human experiences that people inevitably face and does so with commendable results.",Collateral Beauty

25,Reno-Rangan,Love. Time. Death.,7,14 September 2017,"I think I underestimated this flick. Despite a wonder cast, I judged the film before watching it. I was surprised how beautiful film it was. Though not a film of the year. It was like 'A Christmas Carol', except the past, present and future were replaced with different topics. And for each topic, separate set of characters with one twist at the end. The overall film was short and sweet.A successful businessman man who had lost his child seems not able to come out of the sorrow. His partners are worried for him, as well as the firm's future. So they come up with an idea to bring back their partner that they hire actors to help him recover. How the remaining tale turns out and the last part of the story brings an emotional ending.There were lots of actors for just an 90 minute film. But everybody had a fair share. Nobody was greater than others. Smith had less dialogues as his role demanded that. From all, Winslet role was so ordinary, comparing her star value. Knightley was good, but her one of the dialogues about 'love' was awesome. Norton, Pena and Mirren, all were good in their respective parts.An emotional film, but I don't think it appeals enough to everybody. As I'm being a fan of that theme, I felt it should have been a bit strong in those parts. Other than that it was a good film, a family friendly drama. It was not based on any book, though, looks like one. Surely worth a watch, especially if you love tearjerker films.7/10",Collateral Beauty
26,cruise01,Forgettable and boring.,4,14 April 2017,"Collateral Beauty is a drama film that could have been great with well-done characters and a strong meaning about grief and loss. For some reason, the script and the plot was cliché and predictable. Do not get me wrong, the film has a great cast talent and tries to become a different take on a Christmas carol. The plot follows Howard (Will Smith) a successful executive until his life is turned upside down when his daughter passed away. He became so enclosed and depressed that even his business partners worry for him and their stake with their company. Whit (Edward Norton), Claire (Kate Winslet), and Simon (Michael Pena) hired a private investigator to capture evidence that Howard is incapable of running the company and notices he is writing letters to love, time, and death. The trio tries to hire three stage actors to portray as Love, Time, and Death. So they can try to help Howard and is unstable mental condition. I love the cast they have in the film like Will Smith, Edward Norton, Keira Knightley, Michael Pena, Naomie Harris, Jacob Latimore, Helen Mirren, and Kate Winslet. They all did their best. The script tried to give each of these characters a bit of development. Like Whit going through a divorce and is trying to be there for his daughter. Simon struggling with an illness that he has not shared to his wife. The script was unbalance trying to fit in with these characters struggles making the direction feel incoherent. In the end, these characters are forgettable. It has its predictability's and cliché that the film is flawed. Even though, it is suppose to be meaningful and emotional with the state of loss and grief. Collateral Beauty surprisingly was not as good as I was expecting from a script that created forgettable characters, a direction that is boring and incoherent. I was expecting a lot more from this.",Collateral Beauty
27,Floated2,Doesn't live up to the hype,2,15 November 2017,"Collateral Beauty seemed to have some hype and fans going for the film leading up to its release due to its case, though once the first trailers came out, there were a bit of skeptical considering they came across as forced and clear ""Oscar bait"". Some of trailers led to believe the film was different, though from the actual film, it isn't as good and comes across as forced and cheesy. A lot of the film tried too hard at being emotional, depressing and intelligent but in actually it is quite silly, over the top and not that engaging. It is quite bizarre and the panning from the critics (13% on Rottentomatoes, 23 on Metacritic) is accurate. However, this appears to be one of those films where casual movie goers like the film much more than the critics (6.8 IMDb, 64% audience score on RT, 6.2 on MT).Collateral Beauty has decent acting for the film but the general plot is quite silly. Will Smith suffers a tragedy that he lost his daughter 2 years ago, where we see he isn't mentally himself and is depressed, so his colleagues decide it would he right in playing a sort of prank on him, in order of getting him to feel better as well as documenting his behavior and showing it to the higher ups so he would not be able to vote for their certain procedure. The film has some okay moments but in general it is quite boring and the side characters are there for filler. Ed Norton's character's subplot with his daughter felt forced, as well as Michael Pena suffering from a sort of illness. We simply did not care too much for them. Overall Collateral Beauty is a massive disappointment, both in box office success and overall quality.",Collateral Beauty
28,eddie_baggins,Hollywood schmaltz done wrong,2,27 April 2017,"His got some runs on the board when it comes to schmaltzy and sentimental dramas with the likes of The Pursuit of Happiness and to a lesser extent 7 Pounds, but continuing on with a worrying amount of recent misfires, Hollywood playmaker Will Smith finds himself a side character in David Frankel's misguided and trite Collateral Beauty.Trying all at once to be both a feel good holiday period event, a heartbreaking tale of grief, loss and of course love as well as an awkward comedy. Beauty is one of those tonally off films that very early on suggests an uneasiness with its material and despite Frankel showcasing form in the past with films like Marley and Me and The Devil Wears Prada, he along with a seriously underdeveloped A-list cast get lost in a dire story of Will Smith's depressed marketing bigwig, that never once threatens to capture our hearts.As Smith's Howard struggles to escape the black hole of depression after his young daughter passes away, his loving (more so money hungry) colleagues in the form of Edward Norton, Michael Pena and Kate Winslet recruit the help of a trio of actors played by Helen Mirren, Keira Knightly and Jacob Latimore to pretend to be Death, Love and Time to make Howard love life again and start making money for the company.It's a truly odd story, one that may've worked had it been handled by someone in the form of Michel Gondry or Spike Jonze but produced here with the oversaturated cheese that Hollywood is known to produce, Frankel's film feels fake, forced and forgettable as well as a curious waste of Smith's time and name brand recognition.Relegated to what feels like a bit player in a story that is supposed to be about him, Howard gives Smith one of his worst roles outside of After Earth and Winter's Tale as we're barely allowed time or insight into Howard's life or history of what made him such a stand-up guy in the first place.We get ample looks at Howard making domino courses, riding his bike angrily around New York City and eventually conversations he has with a token love interest in the form of Naomie Harris's grief counsellor Madeline (whose role feels completely thrown into an already overcrowded support cast) but Howard's fly-in-fly-out nature in the film supposedly about him makes us care very little for what his going through despite the fact we know we clearly should.Final Say – There's nothing wrong with a little Hollywood heart-string pulling but Collateral Beauty is a deserved critical and commercial flop. With a wasted cast, a rather cringe worthy story and an ending that will likely have you rolling your eyes; Frankel's film ends up being another sad chapter in Will Smith's recent career output.1 thrown skateboard out of 5",Collateral Beauty

Well, the performances were really good (especially from Will Smith and Helen Mirren, who were perfect!) and the main story was touching. However, there were some factors that led me to rate this one 4 stars out of 10. And they are mainly due to the story and the way it was presented. So, we have a CEO and founder of a company, who is in depression because he lost his daughter. His colleagues are worried that his actions and indifference towards life would ruin the company. So, in order to save it, but because of other reasons, more personal, they have to prove that he is mentally unfit to continue leading the company. To do that they hire three actors to play Death, Love and Time, after letters the man had sent to those three, blaming them for taking his daughter away. Okay, so the story was a bit confusing at the beginning, but it got better after things were cleared up. But then, the ending tangled things again, especially the final scene. So, because of that, 4 out of 10.",Collateral Beauty
30,leonblackwood,Great storyline but an average execution by the director. 5/10,5,13 August 2017,"Collateral Beauty (2016)Plot: When successful New York ad executive Howard Inlet (Will Smith) suffers a personal tragedy and retreats from life, his friends devise a drastic plan to reach him before he loses everything. Featuring an all-star cast this thought-provoking drama explores how even the deepest loss can reveal moments of beauty, and how the constants of love, time and death interlock in a life fully lived.Review: This movie was cleverly written, and I did find the storyline intriguing at the beginning but after a while, I found it quite boring. The top cast, all put in an emotional performance but the director should have played on the death, time and love concept a bit more. Anyway, Will Smith plays a high flying business man, Howard, whose in partnership with Whit (Edward Norton), Claire (Kate Winslet) and Simon (Michael Pena). After sadly losing his daughter, he puts his company in jeopardy, by not signing important documents which desperately need to be dealt with. All of his partners try to communicate with Howard but he's in a world of his own, and he finds it hard to interact with anyone. After writing touching letters to death, love and time, Whit hires actors to play the 3 elements, to try and get into Howard's mind, and make him face his problems. After a while, it turns out that all of the various characters have there own issues, which they eventually come to terms with during Howard's breakdown. I think the main problem with the film is the slow pace, and the direction that the movie takes. It really does show how different people deal with lose and personal issues but from an entertainment point of view, it seemed to hit a brick wall after a while. With that aside, the cast and the concept kept it interesting throughout but I was expecting more towards the end. Basically, it's not the type of film that you will watch twice, and I personally think that it was a waste of a brilliant cast but it's still a watchable movie, with an original storyline. Watchable!Round-Up: This movie was directed by David Frankel, 58, who also brought you Miami Rhapsody, The Devil Wears Prada, Marley & Me, The Big Year, Hope Springs and One Chance. He certainly has quite a successful career to date, which is why he was able to pull together such a big cast for this movie. Personally I've been disappointed with Will Smith's latest movies, like Concussion, Focus, After Earth and A New York Winter's Tale, and I can't see his latest project, Aladdin, directed by Guy Ritchie, pulling him out of this bad track of movies. On the plus side, he is supposed to be starring in a new Bad Boys movie, which should bring his humorous side to light. As for this movie, the whole cast and crew want it to be taken as a fable, which has a mixture of comedy & drama but I think that they didn't do the writer any justice, who put together a brilliant story, which could have been executed much better from the director. Budget: $36million Worldwide Gross: $88.5millionI recommend this movie to people who are into their drama/romance movie, starring Will Smith, Edward Norton, Kate Winslet, Michael Pena, Helen Mirren, Naomie Harris, Keira Knightley and Jacob Latimore. 5/10",Collateral Beauty
31,TheMovieDiorama,Collateral Beauty can be best described as misguided.,5,27 February 2018,"I can see the intentions of the story, I admire the subject that it's trying to tackle (that being child loss). Somehow, this fell short and unfortunately is a mess. Howard has a promising start to life. Tragically though, he loses his daughter to an illness and slowly his life begins to crumble. He writes letters to three abstractions of life: Love, Death and Time. His work colleagues notice this, and hire three actors to portray the physical representations of these abstractions in an attempt to help him...therapeutically I guess. That's all well and good, but when you use grief and bereavement as a plot device it should be handled with care. In this, they make the protagonist feel like he has mental issues so that his ""friends"" can continue working in the company. Call me old fashioned or sensible, but that's not ok. Suffering is a horrible process, Will Smith excellently conveys this and actually makes quite a powerful performance. Yet, beneath the narrative is this weird jolly undertone that makes it seem like you're watching a romantic comedy. If this was made ten or twenty years ago, it could've had a place. Now though? No. Evidently what attracted audiences was its stellar cast consisting of Will Smith, Kate Winslet, Helen Mirren, Edward Norton, Naomie Harris, Keira Knightley...and more! It just keeps going! To be fair to them, they were all good. The preachy script about time, love and death just doesn't help them. Literally. ""I wish I had more time so I can love and not fear death, but time is running out and time time timeeeeeee."" Then the last five minutes happen and it's just nonsensical. Direction was solid, the whole film was well shot and was nice to look at. But...not enough I'm afraid. Watchable, it's not entirely a collateral mess. Oh, and what even is Collateral Beauty!?

33,jtindahouse,An unconventional film that works because of it,8,25 January 2017,"As you're watching some movies you just know that you love them, and conversely some movies you just know that you despise them. Then there are films like 'Collateral Beauty' which can have you stumped as to your true feelings about them. It wasn't until the final five minutes of the film that I actually worked out I liked it. There was a reason for that though. At about the halfway point in the film you work out that the ending is going to be absolutely crucial to how you feel about the film. Without spoiling anything, I'll simply say that this could not afford to have a standard ""Hollywood"" type ending. In some ways it was, but overall it was different and unique enough to make the whole thing work.There's nothing conventional about 'Collateral Beauty'. The story is told in an almost bizarre way at times, and I think this is a large reason why some people are being tricked into thinking they didn't enjoy it. It's also a very depressing film in its tone. There's a lot of very sad and impactful scenes that you need to brace yourself for.There's obviously an all-star cast lined up for this one. Will Smith in the lead role thoroughly impressed me. We learnt even as far back as a particular episode of 'The Fresh Prince of Bel Air' that he had impressive acting range. He still has it to this day and will get his much cherished Oscar one day I suspect. The one who disappointed me though was Edward Norton. Not in terms of his performance, but in his choice of role. He's so much better than what he was given to work with here. In the right role he's one of the finest actors ever to work in the industry. This was certainly not one of those roles.'Collateral Beauty' really surprised me in terms of how much I enjoy it. There are certain ""cheesy"" elements to it if you want to look at them that way, but to do so would be a negative way of perceiving things in my opinion. I think the thing I liked most about the entire film though was that it made no apologies, because life makes no apologies. It may not be to everyone's liking, but I think it will certainly be enjoyed by more people than the critics are suggesting.",Collateral Beauty

Some misleading trailers can be good, it can sometimes have surprise twists that you don't see coming, although this does have a surprise twist at the end, and I don't mind a surprise twist, but it has to make sense, this twist makes no sense.Will Smith is the only actor here, who I get invested into, his performance I really get invested into, as sad lonely grieving man, really brings the film above a little, when moments he's on screen, the film is watchable, but when moments he's not it's a Collateral Mess, actors Edward Norton, Kate Winslet, and Michael Pena are all good actors, but here they are basically sleepwalking through this. Kiera Knightley and Helen Mirren seem to put in some effort, but goes nowhere. I liked Seven Pounds(2008), in which Will Smith delivered a good performance there, but at least that plot line made sense. Will Smith has made bad movies before, and he always bounced back from, I believe he'll do the same here.This is one movie that tries to think it's smarter then it is.",Collateral Beauty

Edward and Kate are partners in his business firm and close friends-they helped build the company together but when Edward went through a divorce, Will bought some of Edward's shares and is now 60% owner of the company. In his depression, Will starts paying less attention to the company's day-to-day business and his friends really start to worry when Will starts writing letters to abstract ideas, such as Love, Death & Time. Before his daughter died, Will would say that life is based on 3 things; Love, Death & Time. Everyone wants love, they fear Death and they wish they had more Time. After the death of his daughter, Will looses his faith in all 3 and starts writing letters to each one explaining his frustration in them. Edward gets the idea that if they can get actors to confront Will as the human personifications of Love, Death & Time, then maybe Will will snap out of his depression and rejoin the world. Keira is the actor hired to play Love and Helen is the actor hired to portray Death. I'm not totally sure about the meaning of the title, collateral beauty but I think it has something to do with accepting things in life and moving on.

37,peterp-450-298716,Critics claim it's utter crap. May I dispute this?,7,10 April 2017,"""Love. Time. Death. Now these three abstractions connect every single human being on Earth. Everything that we covet, everything that we fear not having, everything that we ultimately end up buying is because at the end of the day we long for love, we wish we had more time, and we fear death.""I'm afraid ""Collateral Beauty"" is just another film pulled along by a spiral of negativity among critics. Sometimes it happens that a certain opinion is being introduced and others use it as a guideline. Slogans such as ""Atrocious cynical and tearful"", ""A tearjerker without value"" and ""Pretentiously hot air"" appeared on my screen to my surprise. Admittedly, it isn't as peerless as ""The pursuit of happiness"". But it's not such a commercial nonsense as ""Men in Black II"" or as annoying as ""After Earth"". Maybe Will Smith isn't the perfect actor for a melodrama and you associate him with a more action-packed and lighter genre. Yet he could convince me as the grieving owner of an advertising agency. Every time a sort of global crusade is being organized against a particular movie and I don't agree with the used arguments, I feel like throwing myself into the breach for it. The last time I felt this urge was with ""47 Ronin"".I admit, a film like ""Hold Me"" brings up more emotions when it's about dying and saying goodbye to someone dear. And content-wise there are plenty of elements so you could label it as a melodrama. But what was the ultimate message? Is the movie solely about suffering, sorrow and pain? Or was the message also about that glimmer of hope, overcoming personal demons and recognizing the real values that are important in a human life? Well, cynics will look at it in a disgusted way. And yes, I myself thought that the end reached a high ""Scrooge"" level. Three metaphors trying to steer the lives of four individuals in the right direction.Not only the life of Howard (Will Smith) needs a little bit of steering. The three co-owners Whit (Edward Norton), Claire (Kate Winslet) and Simon (Michael Pena) have to deal with their own demons. Each of them will get the help of a metaphor to dot the i's en cross the t's. Their joint project is Howard, who leads a comatose and aimlessly life since the death of his six year old daughter (she suffered from a rare form of cancer). The charismatic appearance in the beginning of the film contrasts sharply with the self-destructive person who rides his bike against traffic like a kamikaze blinded by rage. He doesn't care about what will happen with the company he founded. Since months, the only activity there is designing a structure of dominoes. And after several days of hard work, he breaks it down by pushing the first domino. Is this self-destruction in a symbolic way?The first step to join a support group for people trying to handle a loss, is an impossible step for Howard. The next thing Whit, Claire and Simon come up with is a plan to prove that Howard is of unsound mind and can't take any decision because it could harm the firm. That's when three amateur actors enter the picture. Brigitte (Helen Mirren), Amy (Keira Knightley) and Raffi (Jacob Latimore) will perform each as one of the three abstractions and confront Howard with his writings. That is, the letters he writes to the abstractions. In this way they try to provoke an aggressive or irrational reaction.Critics in The US panned the film mercilessly because of exaggerated dramatics and according to public opinion a disgusting preconceived plan of the other shareholders. Let me counter these arguments. Take any season of Grays Anatomy and you'll be drowning in a pool of artificial drama and sickening emotional nonsense (but this is probably due to my hatred for television series). And saying the plan of the co-owners is morally offensive, is a hypocritical statement. I'm sure in the US (and other major capitalist countries) strategies like this are being used on a daily basis, trampling other individuals without pity and pushing them aside strategically. And pointing at Will Smith while claiming he isn't capable to bear a serious film, is also jumping to conclusions. I can't stand Keira Knightley (a film with her in it, and my cozy couch is covered with marks of my fingernails). But that's no reason for me to proclaim the film is totally crap (""Begin Again"" is an example of that).""Collateral Beauty"" is a wonderful film about grief and the consequences when losing a loved one. Admittedly it was a bit predictable. The connection between Madeline (Naomie Harris) and Howard was quite clear upfront. And the end was a bit too magical. But ultimately, I felt the film struck a chord and left an impression on me. Will Smith didn't succeed in moving me to tears as in ""The pursuit of happiness"". And the crying part isn't his strongest talent as an actor. But I still have respect for the person who started as a rebellious, yo-yo-yo rapping teen from Bel-Air.

38,truemythmedia,A Sad Attempt at Being Profound,2,26 November 2019,"Why do I dislike this film so much? There are many reasons, running from nitpick to fundamental flaw, so I hope you understand that not every point I attempt to make is of equal weight in my mind.My main issue with this film is its laziness. This laziness comes in many forms, the first of which is in its writing. I'm sure to many people the writing will seem smart and enjoyable for the way things seem to click together with mirror images finding each other and completing each other in a variety of scenes. This does not take great skill to do. It's actually quite easy since you are in control of all the variables. What is difficult is creating dead ends, misdirects, character flaws, and personal failures that seem real, earned, and connect with the audience.Another sign of laziness in the film are the metaphors employed. Don't get me started on how lazy of a metaphor a domino is and it is used throughout the film. Used is a kind word, though. There are multiple scene that have dominos in them. They are never used to reveal anything, emphasize anything, or contribute to a single character's journeys or growth. Why even have them in the film?The reason everything clicks together nicely in this film is because it is simple and easily controlled. Most of the characters have a relationship with one person, Howard, and then one struggle in life in the form of another relationship or lack of one. As a result, their problems are easily fixed over the course of the film.Don't get me wrong, I love a simple plot, but only when its simplicity is used as a way of communicating inner complexity. This is a film that eschews complexity for the sake of simple answers and ephemeral easy feelings.This is a film that wants us to look at the silver lining in every dark cloud but doesn't ever let us get a real glimpse at the dark cloud. The answers it offers feel trite compared to real pain which most of us have endured. Showing us the story of this man's life falling apart might have made it hard to keep certain twists (which are forecast a mile away) and it might have made the movement of Howard's character more complicated but it would have felt a lot more true than never ever seeing the relationship he is missing or the circumstances of his pain and then having complete strangers speak to him about that pain in generalities.This film fails hard because they want to show us how beautiful the world is despite the pain we see but never lets us see the pain. The tacit message is that the pain must be forgotten, avoided, and not entered into. What could be more unhelpful than that.Heap on top of this the number of film school 101 hacky devices which get used in the film and you have a terrible movie that struggled to keep my interest in between rolls of my eyes. He writes letters to Death, Time, and Love? If I had a nickel for every story I've heard pitched where people represent concepts of emotions I'd have enough money to make a better film than this one.This film attempts to wrestle with real tragedy and pain in people's lives but, unfortunately, lacks the courage to look at those difficulties in an honest and meaningful way. It seems more interested in patting people on the back and saying, 'see, it all works out and there is beauty out there,"" than it is in giving audiences the experience of finding beauty in the midst of ugliness. That would take real skill in writing, acting, directing and might not make as much money. I know, all things that this film wasn't willing to put in for the sake of its own silver lining. The film makers seem to have forgotten that silver linings need dark clouds in order to shine brightly and one without the other just isn't as beautiful.",Collateral Beauty
39,Amari-Sali,Will Smith continues to explore his abilities as an actor and taps into that well which made The Pursuit of Happiness one of his best films.,7,16 December 2016,"Trigger Warning(s): Conversations about Death of a ChildReview (with Spoilers)Noted Actor(s)Howard (Will Smith) | Whit (Edward Norton) | Claire (Kate Winslet) | Simon (Michael Pena) | Amy (Keira Knightley) | Raffi (Jacob Latimore) | Brigitte (Helen Mirren)StorylineLosing a child, be it physically or the chance to have one, is devastating. This little person, you don't get to watch them grow up in the image of you and the one you used to love the most. You don't get to see some of your personality slip into another being. Like fingerprints on hardened clay. Death takes that from you, time makes your suffering seem like it could last forever, and love is replaced by their evil twin hate.That is the shared story of Howard, Whit, Claire and Simon. Each trying to deal with a different aspect of a child which doesn't exist, they wish existed, or wished they were closer to. Something which three people, Brigitte, Amy, and Raffi try to assist in by being the voice each character needs to hear.HighlightsSmith Continues to GrowI can't remember who said it, though I feel it was someone on Shadow and Act, but Will Smith is coming to a new stage of his career which is refreshing. Now, some may disagree, they may miss Mr. $100 million at the box office but there has to be more to acting than making money. Will Smith, if you hear the stories about his house and life, he has more than enough money. He proved, hell his family has proved, you can be Black, likable, touch any genre of music and movies, and have some form of success.So what now? Well, there was one review which actually praised Smith's real big flop in After Earth and I think that person predicted the future of Will Smith. He is no longer content with films which are easy. He wants something hard, which pushes him to feel, and actually put more work into the production than knowing his lines, showing up on time, and marketing the film. In After Earth, he had to learn to tone down his charisma and be still. He had to learn how to rely on another actor, unfortunately, his own son, and not necessarily be the star.In many ways, since then, we have seen him grow or at least try to. Arguably, Suicide Squad was about him learning to be one of many. Not being the person who got the final hit or the sole star. Concussion was about being in a movie which dealt with controversy, trying to perform with an accent, and honestly, he is living up to the idea that sometimes you have to fail to get better. However, in this film, it seems we may finally be seeing he is learning something about dramatic acting. We saw a glimpse of it in Ali and The Pursuit of Happiness, but the onion which is the abilities of smith gets peeled back another layer as we watch him be a depressed man. Not depressed like in Hancock where there is some wit or sarcasm, but from After Earth you see him tapping into a person who is controlled and drained. Someone who lost a life and doesn't know the point of going on past that. In many ways, it is like Smith has graduated from one level and this is his start into the next.CriticismLet's Kick Howard While He Is DownGood thing: This isn't some remixed version of The Christmas Carol. Bad Thing: It deals with a group of friends trying to sell their company because their boss has become unproductive and the company's value is dropping fast. So, as a group, they decide to set him up to look crazy so his signature won't be needed on the final documents for when they sell.On The FenceMany Good Stories, Too Many In One MovieI am a firm believer that unless the actors are Viola Davis level and/or the story are superbly written, splitting the focus within a drama is a mistake. Reason being, you lose all the development and time needed to craft a fully dimensional person. Leaving the audience with something as real as a microwave dinner. Yeah, it maybe sustenance, but all the flavor and taste just isn't there because time was limited so the real deal just wasn't an option.To go further, each person, not even bringing Howard into the equation, has a movie plot within itself. Claire is at the age where having a child is difficult, Simon is no longer in remission and, for the 3rd time in his life, cancer has returned. Oh, and may I add, it is within weeks or months after his child is born? Then with Whit, he ruined his marriage and the collateral damage of that is the hatred of his adolescent daughter who doesn't want to speak to him or spend quality time with him.Each of those stories aren't given justice and it is so frustrating because you almost feel cheated because of it.Overall: Mixed (Home Viewing)While Smith continues to progress by taking on roles that perhaps challenge him, unfortunately, while the role maybe good for him he keeps picking movies which are not. Like Suicide Squad, this film seems diluted by the amount of talent whose lives are made too big to just be supporting roles and thus too small to be ultimately satisfying. Yet, I will admit, you may get emotional and won't walk away thinking you wasted your money. However, you may very well feel that given a taste of everything may have left you full but not at all satisfied.",Collateral Beauty
40,rgkarim,A Collateral Cast Makes This Movie Emotional,7,17 December 2016,"We all know Charles Dickens' classic tale the Christmas Carol and all the lessons it teaches this time of season. It's a story that has been told through many mediums that continue to entertain the masses. This weekend, we get a similar tale to grace the theater entitled Collateral Beauty starring Will Smith and a slew of other characters. The question is though, does this twist work? Hi Robbie K here, privileged to share some thoughts on another movie. Shall we get started?LIKES:  Fantastic Acting  Equal Screen Time  Good use of Music  Fantastic moralsWith a star, studded cast that includes Will Smith, Kate Winslet, Hellen Mirren, and Edward Norton you expected good acting. Well good news, the acting met the expectations placed on the cast. Smith of course takes the lead, delivering another grand performance of someone suffering in life (7 pounds and pursuit of happiness). He sells the anger and hurt, while maintaining his emotional balance to prevent falling into overacting territory. Edward Norton, again delivers a sound performance and probably has the most diverse energy of the cast. Newcomer Jacob Lattimore surprised me with his performance, which although a little skewed, had the teenage angst and aggression representative of time. But the champion actor is Helen Mirren, who continues to prove that age brings experience. Mirren was the funniest of the group, but managed to sell the morals of the movie the most without going too far. She engages so well with the entire cast, and does a good job as the keystone of the movieyou know past Will Smith. The entire group again does a fantastic job altogether, and even better are all balanced through the movie, each member getting close to equal time (which is sometimes unheard of). While the acting certainly helps make the story come to life, the editing of the movie helped amplify the emotions of the film. The cinematography is beautifully executed, combining the enchanting scenery with the raw pain of our suffering characters. You'll get plenty of close ups on tear stricken faces and troubled stares as our characters face the ordeals at hand. But it's the background symphony music, that helps add that edge to get the tears flowing. Beautiful piano work helps sell the scene, subtle at times before unleashing its full power as the lessons are learned. The culmination of audio and visual are fantastic tools to seal the deal for the morals this film has to offer. And speaking of morals, the writers did a nice job twisting the tale to focus on dealing with life's problems. Aside from Will Smith's trial of accepting his daughter's death, the other characters each have their own trials to face that involve self- assessment, acceptance, and a willingness to try and make things better. Preachy as it can be, these important lessons are taught with the fantastic lines and strong acting premise. DISLIKES:  Not as deep as I thought  Felt Incomplete  Lackluster  More spirit interventions would have been niceDespite all the good I reported, Collateral Beauty still has some rough edges that need some smoothing out. For one thing, I felt there could have been more emotional punch to this film. I felt the lessons in my heart, but I wasn't borderline crying in this film. It felt like they held back on the emotional punch. Whether this is due to some production quirks, some shallower plots, or the fact that the trailer delivered much of the film could have diluted it. The movie also felt incomplete at parts, as if other scenes were needed or perhaps scenes deleted to take out the incomplete feeling. In addition, the movie is a bit lackluster from the various tellings of the Christmas Carol. This film doesn't have the terror or suspense that Dickens' three spirits contain, although they are much more entertaining. This movie, despite teaching values, was just not as unique as I think it wanted to be. There were no grandiose twists, no outstanding spirit designs, and no key features to help make this movie stand out from similar morale tales. I think I also wanted more spiritual interventions as well, another round to drive the point home to Howard. The VERDICTCollateral Beauty is certainly an example of great acting, as our stars have incredible chemistry, integrate through most of the movie, and have the emotional balance we would want in such a cast. In addition, the morals are taught well thanks to the strong dialogue and wonderful audio/visual techniques to amplify the emotions. However, there was something missing that just didn't make this movie as emotionally deep as I expected. Still, this is a movie that will move many and a good, fun movie for the holiday season. Is it needed to be seen in the big screen? When looking at the technical qualities and the unique aspect of the filmno this movie is worth a Redbox rent. However, in regards to the moral lessons and heartfelt story, this one is worth a visit. My scores are:Drama: 7.5 Movie Overall: 6.5",Collateral Beauty

42,Kingslaay,Not well executed,6,8 May 2020,"Collateral Beauty is quite a deep film yet it lacked a good guiding hand. A better director and team could have transformed it into a powerful and meaningful film. Otherwise it falls flat and comes across as not strong enough. There is no emotional pay off and good set up to carry it all the way through. Despite strong performances it is not enough to save this film. The deeper themes could have been explained better, there could have been more symbolism present and yes a much stronger director and team at the helm.",Collateral Beauty
43,eric262003,"Not Great, But Doesn't Deserve The Maltreatment It's Been Getting",6,18 December 2017,"Over the years, Will Smith has shown to be a well-rounded performer. It's just a crime shame that ""Collateral Beauty"" has been plagued with negative slack from the critics, complaining for reasons that are so unnecessary it's almost laughable. Granted he has been in his share of comedies, action, science-fiction and summer blockbuster films, but what his best dramatic performance before ""Collateral Beauty""? My guess would be ""The Legend of Bagger Vance"". It's probably ages since the critics have been on the rampage to arbitrarily take apart a worthy film and badly ostracize it in every way possible. It's a shame this movie was the metaphoric punching bag. Though I can't really regard it as a classic, it still has many qualities that standout quite remarkably. For starters, Will Smith can still stand toe to toe with any performer regardless of all the awards and accolades his other co-stars have received over the years. Think of the performers that are in this movie. You have Edward Norton, Kate Winslet, Keira Knightly and Helen Mirren are all two-time Oscar winners and it's a shame that Michael Pena has been overlooked of getting one. Smith is the guy that truly sands out above the flock even though his character is most of the time wordless. Another trait that makes this movie enjoyable is when it targets at the cliches, even when it abides by other cliches. At least it targeted the cliches that have annoyed me the most over the years. I won't delve into the arcs of the characters, but once you see the move you'll see which cliches are being targeted. In one of the more surprising elements that makes this movie work was that very little spoilers were seen in the trailers, especially by placing the best scenes in the trailers and all the less interesting scenes out which I hate. I want to see a film where even good scenes are left out of the trailers not be hoodwinked and have my intelligence insulted. As I've said before there are still plenty of traits that make this film far from perfect. In his time of grievance over the loss of his young daughter, Smith's friends seem to treat him pretty shabby and now they are yearning for the viewer's redemption. I don't think so! The film easily persuades us we should go into that process and think everything they said can be forgiven. However, the swerve in Smith's character was too rushed making it feel quite unnatural and the twist was just way too ironic to be solved.  The transformations to change in the other characters from unlikable to more sympathetic seem to happen so soon and too sudden. Thematically it went with the story and it made perfect sense, it was very rough in its delivery which wasn't fully satisfying. Others might agree or disagree it's their opinions and they're entitles to it. When the smoke clears, ""Collateral Beauty"" is a a great film with did not deserve the negative backlash it got from the critics. It delivered the way it was intended and in a rare instance it had me in tears. Sure it overlooks the subject of death and grief, but it stays true to its intentions and is meat to tug at your emotions. And that is not entirely a bad thing.",Collateral Beauty
44,bkrauser-81-311064,May Just Be 2016's Worst Movie,2,16 January 2017,"I read somewhere that 2016, in addition to having a leap day also included a leap second that the powers that be added unceremoniously to New Year Eve. While the reasons for this are scientifically understandable, the goofy Facebook click-bait that followed the announcement only reinforced the idea that the year was simply not going to end. Watching Collateral Beauty in 2017 is like reliving that extra second of 2016 over and over again over an hour and thirty seven minutes. Much like this past year, I looked on Collateral Beauty with cautious optimism - I then quickly graduated to anger, migrated towards the ""well s**t"" feeling of detachment you get when everything goes off the rails, before finally simpering in my seat praying for the sweet release of death.Will Smith plays a cardboard cutout named Howard whose advertising agency's mantra is based on humanity's relationship to time, love and death (also Dominos). Since the death of his six-year-old daughter however, Howard's become virtually catatonic botching business relationships and new contracts with his constant moping. His business associates Whit (Norton), Claire (Winslet) and Simon (Pena) worry Howard's mental state will ruin the company. Howard is seems worries about nothing anymore.At some point in this train wreck, Howard comes to believe he is having conversations with the concepts of Death (Mirren), Time (Latimore) and Love (Knightley). I will try not to drop any serious spoilers, lest to say Collateral Beauty is not as advertised and the results are about as contrived as a hipsters beard and as morally dubious as enjoying a Nazi romance story. Make no mistake, this movie is such an unholy mess of maligned story elements, faux sentimentality and outdated influences that it did cross my mind that I was living in a Twilight Zone (1959-1964) episode; or at the very least living in a middle school playwright's first draft of his ""edgy,"" first student led play.The inexcusably bad quality of this film is downright absurd considering the talent involved. On their own the fiery instincts of Edward Norton, the marshaled power of Kate Winslet or failing that the stateliness of Helen Mirren should have been enough to save this movie. But much like faded, badly preserved paintings adorning the walls of a Best Western, the actors all just hang there lifeless. Will Smith, our interminably absent lead has surpassed his work in Seven Pounds (2008) to turn in the most painfully artificial character he's ever played. His depictions of a grief stricken father are so insultingly sweeping and tertiary that I honestly believe in preparation for the role he stared at a sad clown painting until he got a migraine.Of course it's not his fault, nor the fault of any of the actors on screen. Much like the Dominos that Howard patiently stacks in his pristine glass office, Collateral Beauty is built on a lousy foundation. I think the film is trying to update the saccharin chastity of Frank Capra's It's a Wonderful Life (1946) for modern audiences. But if that's the case, none of that film's clarity of mind survived the transfer. Nor its ability to coax real emotions which this movie fumbles to the point of unintentional hilarity.Collateral Beauty is like watching the cheery, life-affirming moral of ""A Christmas Carol"" being hit by an Uber. The implications of this movie are so thoroughly twisted, the joints of the story painfully exposed and the talent involved have been reduced to nothing more than grease stains. 2016 is over - as of this review it's been over for seven days. But the residue of such a painful year still lives on in the recess of this films putrid, noxious bowels. I guess before it died 2016 really did s**t itself.",Collateral Beauty
45,LeonardKniffel,"Potter Would Call It ""Sentimental Hogwash""",8,29 November 2020,"Lionel Barrymore as Mr. Potter in ""It's a Wonderful Life"" no doubt would call ""Collateral Beauty"" sentimental hogwash. But then Potter was the meanest man in town. Yes the director could have made a better movie and made better use of the incredibly talented cast, but he didn't. He made this movie, and critics who take movies to task for what they aren't are usually cynical beyond belief, able to ignore a genuine effort to make a film about what the death of a child means to parents whose lives are irreparably damaged. Will Smith delivers a remarkable performance that can make you cry by just looking at his grieving face. There are times that the allusions to Dickens' ""A Christmas Carol"" are obvious and may make you wish that this film had gone even farther with the fantastic elements. But a ""Christmas Carol"" has been made into a film several times, so this is more of a variation on a theme. Let's put it this way, if you are a fan of Quentin Tarantino, this film will nauseate you. If you love ""It's a Wonderful Life,"" this one is for you.",Collateral Beauty
46,Screen_Blitz,"Emotionally charged drama is beautifully acted, but its too manipulative to take seriously",4,15 March 2017,"Recovering from his disastrous role in 'After Earth' in 2013, Will Smith attempts to rebuild his acting career in this emotionally stirring drama following his role in last year's biopic 'Concussion'. Stepping in the shoes of a father dealing with the devastating power of grief and depression, Smith stars along a roster of A-list actors who serve as the highlight of this film's marketing. Unfortunately, an awe-inspiring cast of Edward Norton, Kate Winslet, and Michael Pena can only do so much to save this movie from the overly manipulative slog it transpires to. And one of the main enemies that bars this melodrama from reaching the heights of Oscar material is not only the schmaltzy script but a twisted concept that director David Frankel misrepresents in the marketing. Unlike how this film is advertised, this film follows Howard Inlet (played by Will Smith), a successful New York advertising executive who sinks into extreme depression following the death of his six-year old daughter. He spends his days relinquishing his executive duties writing letters to abstract figures: Love, Time, and Death. Fearing for the progress of their company, his co-workers Whit (played by Edward Norton), Claire (played by Kate Winslet), and Simon (played by Michael Pena) respond to his predicament by hiring three actors Amy (played by Keira Knightly), Raffi (played by Jacob Latimer), and Brigitte (played by Helen Mirren) to meet up with Howard and portray human versions of Love, Time, and Death respectively. In the meantime, they hire someone to record him interacting with them and then use a software to digitally erase the actors to show the company that he is ""mentally unstable"" to run to company.....Seriously? It is clear within the first ten minutes that the film aims for little more than to tug at your heart strings. The idea of a parent losing his or her child to cancer is everyone parent's worst nightmare, and a deeply somber subject considering the emotional damage induces. The story showcases the extreme depression the lead character faces upon losing his daughter which establishes a deep emotional core of the story. The idea starts off on a fairly strong note. But when the supporting characters callous plan comes into action, that is when the story makes a hollow turn. Will Smith's character battling depression over a devastating loss and struggling to find the capacity to do his job, and his coworkers decide that the best solution is to hire actors to make an utter fool out of him -- something equivalent to a childish high school prank. From there on, the real drama comes not from his overwhelming depression but how morally despicable these characters are. It becomes one of those rare circumstances where a story's attempts at pulling at the heart strings borders on the line of unintentional laughter, if a little disgust for inhuman his coworkers are. Although the film generates a few good moments of genuine sentimentality such as his meetings with the support group hosted by Naomie Harris as well as well as some well-landed attempts at humor, the plot is a bit hard to take seriously for how unduly contrived the execution is. The ending, while somewhat of a tear-jerker, falls victim to a rather cheesy twist.For an ensemble cast flowing of A-list actors, solid performances can only be expected. Fortunately, the cast performances serve as the saving grace for the movie's deeply flawed rendering. Stepping into the lead role is Will Smith, Oscar-nominated actor who does a magnificent job at showing his dramatic muscle with his performance. Among the large cast, he is easily the biggest standout in terms of performance and emotional heft. Edward Norton gives an honest performance as a man who reveals to be going through a divorce and is struggling to maintain the affection of his daughter. The same can be said for Kate Winslet as Claire who's struggling conceive a child through artificial semenation due to her being too old, and Michael Pena as a married man who's battling cancer and trying to hide it from his family. These actors share a rather thin chemistry with the trio of actors (Helen Mirren, Jacob Latimer, and Keira Knightly) who serve as nothing more than one-dimensional representations of their life dilemmas. In the other words, the supporting cast proves themselves capable of pulling off good performances, although they only make up half of the equation of for how ham-fisted their characters are.Collateral Beauty is a contrived emotionally charged melodrama suffers from a shrewd execution, with only a plethora of riveting performances to keep it standing. Calling this movie is a flop may feel a little bit of an overstatement, but it is hard to deny how fundamentally miscalculated it is. Anyone with a heavy heart may understandably find themselves weeping buckets, but only if they can get past the primary flaws.",Collateral Beauty

48,rockman182,Collateral Beauty (2016),5,25 February 2017,"Collateral Garbage. Seriously. I'm going to break this down though. When I first saw the trailer for this film, my immediate thoughts were ""wow this looks like a really emotionally manipulative film"". And that is exactly what it is. But its even worse. This film was panned by most critics and I can see why. However, being the film lover that I am I decided to watch it to form my own opinion. Boy oh boy, I wonder why so many credible actors took the role for this film.First things first, the trailer for this film is incredibly misleading. Talk about manipulating right off the bat. Love, Death, and Time are three actors hired by Edward Norton, Kate Winslet, and Michael Pena to follow Will Smith's character and prove that he is crazy so he can give up his position in a flailing company. Why is the company failing? Smith's character recently lost his daughter to a rare disease and has been depressed and unfocused since. While the film may sound like it has heart, it does not. Its so misguiding and you can't even forgive how ridiculous the premise of the film is.I hate when trailers set you up for a certain film but then throw a bad curveball. This is the case with this film. I also feel bad for the acting talent (Knightley, Mirren, Winslet, Norton) who probably didn't look at the script before signing on for this film. I think Will Smith is a solid actor but he almost always picks bad films (especially recently). This film becomes downright infuriating at times. I can't get into it much because it would spoil the film but wow the end of this film is so, so stupid. There's multiple ""twists"" for the sake of being quirky but its really bad writing.This film is so misguided. The writings bad, I think someone should have checked it and edited it before putting it out there as the final product. If you are interested in the film based on watching the trailer be forewarned, that this film will pull a punch on you. Its an over-emotional, sappy, and at times incoherent but convenient mess. I am so glad that my number one BAE Rooney Mara did not follow through on this crap.5/10",Collateral Beauty
49,jon.h.ochiai,"In the ""Collateral Beauty""",9,18 December 2016,"""Collateral Beauty"" is flawed, beautiful, and amazing. In the opening scene, Will Smith as Howard, CEO of his New York advertising agency, is movie star Will—handsome, fit, and charismatic. He asks his employees, ""What is your why?"" He iterates, ""Love. Time. Death."" We all want love. We don't have enough time. And we all fear death. Three years later, the swag is gone. Howard has aged more than President Obama in his first term. He has lost his ""why""— his purpose. His 6 year-old daughter died from a rare form of cancer, his wife has left, and he is virtually catatonic. He wanders the office creating expansive domino constructs. Howard is angry at the universe, but finds his screams don't even generate an echo. To survive he buries his anger to numb the pain. He gets so angry at the universe that he writes letters to Love, Time, and Death. Then surprisingly, they respond back. This is the touching and inspired fable of Director David Frankel's (""The Devil Wears Prada"") ""Collateral Beauty"". Writer Allan Loeb's story is ambitious, daring ideas that matter—love, time, death, and forgiveness. I think initially Loeb's story seems capriciously mechanical, canny, and manipulative. On the surface reprehensible narrative elements emerge which in retrospect are necessary albeit clumsily executed. Loeb's domino metaphor poetically captures Howard's past becoming his present and future. But does this have to be so? ""Collateral Beauty"" is blessed with Will Smith and Helen Mirren, who are awesome. Will Smith acts his ass off. I read that he dealt with his own father's passing while making the movie. His performance is fearless and raw. Helen Mirren plays ""Death"" and is mesmerizing. When she knowingly closes her eyes with Simon (Michael Pena), I got the movie. Helen and Will possess poignant screen partnership. On the emotional subway ride Howard unloads on Death from the Tibetan Book of the Dead to ""Life is, but a dream."" Mirren is silently still, and listens. Smith and Mirren are sublime. ""Collateral Beauty"" is about the compassion to listen to another's soul. I read numerous published movie reviews outraged by the movie for being emotionally played. Yeah, if being played moves and inspires, then I am okay with that. I think with ""Collateral Beauty"" you may want to watch and listen with your soul. Frankel and Loeb share great ideas intended to be gotten, not so much analyzed or understood. They even cop to this. Howard (Smith) dismisses grief counselor Madeleine's (Naomie Harris) epiphany of ""collateral beauty"" as utter bulls**t. Initially, we do as well. Perhaps ""collateral beauty"" is like cosmic propinquity— a connection to the universe that transcends love, time, and death. Collateral beauty begins to resonate. Howard's debilitating despondence jeopardizes his once thriving company. Howard's best friend and co-founder Whit (Edward Norton) informs Howard of a lucrative buyout deal. He doesn't care, but has 60% interest in the company. Howard's other loyal friends Claire (Kate Winslet) and Simon (Michael Pena) are equally concerned about their livelihood. In a repugnant turn all three conspire against Howard, disguised as helping him. Whit uses the private investigator his ex- wife employed to uncover his own infidelity to discern Howard's weakness. Sally (callous Ann Dowd) 'steals' the letters Howard wrote to Love, Time, and Death. Whit devises a plan to hire actors to play Love (Keira Knightley), Time (Jacob Latimore), and Death (Helen Mirren) with the rules that only Howard can see them. So Love is a beautiful young woman; Time is a young African American hipster; Death is an old white woman in blue. The actors confront Howard in public while being filmed, with their digital images removed in post editing. This will either therapeutically cure Howard or bury him in a corporate competency clause. Supposed loyal friends turn ruthless. Claire objects, but not vehemently enough. Who precisely is being played? Frankel and Loeb's narrative synchronicity kicks in. Whit is estranged from his daughter Allison (unintentionally unlikeable Kylie Rogers), and wants desperately back in her life. He is paired with Love. Claire forfeited motherhood for the company; now anguishes over the cost. She is paired with Time. Simon, who has the telltale cough, hides a secret from his family. He is paired with Death. Self aware Howard befriends Madeleine (Harris), who leads a grief counseling group for parents who suffered their child passing. Howard confesses, ""I'm trying to fix my mind."" This storyline authentically grounds ""Collateral Beauty"". The movie powerfully deals with loss, gracious acceptance, and promise. Performances transform ""Collateral Beauty"". Forgive some the awkward melodrama for the greater cause. Norton is so vulnerable when tells Love about his daughter's birth. Pena surprises in his predictable role, particularly with Mirren's Death. Knightley's tearful visage illuminates when Howard tells Love, ""You broke my heart!"" Winslet's gravitas overcomes the sketchy Claire character, especially in her relationship to Time. Latimore holds his own as Howard lashes out about his daughter. Smith and Mirren awe us. Mirren's profound passion and compassion guide the path. Her unsaid is magic. Smith gives ""Collateral Beauty"" its heart. He effortlessly balances levity and power. I think his listlessness covers the hurt in Howard's soul. He is hysterical when Love interrupts his dinner. I cried in the board room scene where Smith is unconditional love and forgiveness. We are so for Smith as his Howard courageously makes his way back into life. I did not understand all the narrative twists for Howard, and I got them. ""Collateral Beauty"" is perhaps the worst critically reviewed movie of the year. So I really don't know anything.

50,dave-mcclain,"""Collateral Beauty"" is a wonderful, but incomplete movie.",8,15 December 2016,"Some movies manipulate the audiences' emotions, while others just connect. ""Collateral Beauty"" (PG-13, 1:37) is the latter. Who among us cannot relate to the loss of a loved one, or to divorce, or loneliness, disease, financial hardships or simply feeling rudderless in life? We've all been there, in one or two of these situations or more. This movie explores all of those challenges, while showing us how our troubles are connected – with each other – and with our joys, as well as with the beauty that always surrounds us even if we choose not to see it. The film focuses on sadness and tragedy (one tragedy in particular), but rather than being depressing, it manages to be uplifting and pretty entertaining too.Howard Inlet (Will Smith) is a successful advertising executive, but his business doesn't matter much to him anymore, nor does anything else in his life. His daughter has died, but it wasn't just her young life that ended. Howard also lost his marriage, his ability to enjoy life, his ability to love and even his very will to live. Now, he feels like he may be losing his mind too. His friends and co-workers are afraid of the same thing, and they're afraid that the company he started could be lost too. Trying to save the ad agency (and thus preserve their own futures), Whit Yardsham (Edward Norton), Claire Wilson (Kate Winslet) and Simon Scott (Michael Peña) come together to try proving what is obvious to all of them, that Howard is no longer capable of running his company. They hope that they will be able to save their jobs (and those of the others who work at the agency) and, hopefully, save their friend in the process even while dealing with their own struggles with issues that seem to reflect those affecting Howard.Although it may look like Howard has given up on life, he's still trying to work through his feelings over the loss of his daughter. He stands outside the windows of a local support group for people who have lost a child and one day, he actually works up the courage to enter, which gives the group leader (Naomie Harris) the opportunity to reach out to him. Meanwhile, Howard writes and mails letters to Love, Time and Death, as if they were people. A private detective (Ann Dowd), whom Whit, Claire and Simon have hired to follow Howard and gather information on his activities and his mental state, manages to retrieve those letters and share them with her clients. Then, Howard begins receiving personal answers to his letters in the form of in-person encounters and conversations with an old woman (Helen Mirren) calling herself Death, a teenager (Jacob Latimore) who says he is Time and a beautiful young woman (Keira Knightley) who identifies herself as Love. Can Howard's talks with Time, Love and Death help him to get past his grief, or will they only prove that he's lost touch with reality? ""Collateral Beauty"" is a wonderful, but incomplete movie. The ways that Allan Loeb's script portrays both uncommon tragedies and common struggles are relatable, and his perspective is both realistic and encouraging. David Frankel's direction is sensitive and includes some subtle humor to help us handle the pathos. The story's reveals are highly satisfying, if somewhat predictable. Mainly, I wish that the movie had better emphasized the point implied in its title. Then there's that one big plot hole which could've been easily fixed but I'm willing to (kind of) overlook it in order to give this creative and valuable movie its due. It's a modern ""It's a Wonderful Life"" (and some of Smith's underseen 2008 drama ""Seven Pounds""), but forges its own path. Its heartfelt performances (from a stable of past Oscar winners and nominees), its lessons about family, friendship and forgiveness, and its Christmastime setting, make this a great holiday movie.

51,MihaiSorinToma,An average drama,7,1 July 2017,"A charismatic person, full of life and joy suffers deeply after the loss of his six year old daughter. He retires into his own thoughts, living alone, while his agency for which he worked so hard with three friends gets on the verge of bankruptcy. Seeing the situation become desperate, the three seek out to enter his disturbed world, hoping to save him or prove that he's mentally ill, both ways saving the agency and earning a lot of money.It's a movie which presents the drama of a man who entered a state of depression after the loss of his beloved daughter. It presents how he copes with the situation, what he does in order to rectify something and what he receives from outside, while preparing an unexpected ending. Unfortunately, the movie is very slow paced and dull, most of the actions leaving the impression that they lead nowhere. The three friends have a good and interesting idea in terms of entering his world, but their characters are not well developed and simplistic. Furthermore, you don't feel any pity for their situation, making you even think of them as some kind of bad people, looking only for their personal well being.What I did like about this movie was Will's performance which made his complex character credible, thus making you care about his faith. The plot twist in the end also is a white ball for this film, which proved to be quite average overall. The focus was put on the friends' attempt to save the agency but their characters and ultimately their actions proved to be a letdown from my point of view.",Collateral Beauty
52,jrarichards,Takes various gambles ... most of which come off ultimately,9,9 February 2017,"Like any sensible cinemagoer, I don't want to know too much in advance, and am PARTICULARLY glad not to have heard beforehand how the critics panned ""Collateral Beauty"" - given that I feel - OVERALL - they were wrong to do so. ALL THINGS CONSIDERED, I'm more than happy to say positive things here.It will be clear from that that I DO recognise how ""CB"" could have gone off the rails. But my conclusion, my gut feeling after actual exposure, is that IT DID NOT DO SO... For literally a couple of minutes at the start of ""Collateral Beauty"", we get to see the Will Smith role we know and love. His Howard Inlet is assertive, sassy and smooth-talking, and the talk he's smoothest with concerns his marketing profession, at which he excels, and within which he feels greatest effectiveness will be achieved if activity is predicated on the ever-present nature in our lives of: love, time and death.For the rest of the film (that's 90+ minutes of precious ""time"" that do not drag at all), we have a new side to Will Smith, as Howard's life continues in ruins, despite the passage of some time since the death of his young daughter, for whom his love remains strong, and his denial even stronger... This was an acting challenge for Smith, and there are moments here when we feel he's not quite pulling it off. That's gamble 1 from Director David Frankel (and writer Allan Loeb), but ultimately, IMHO, Smith's work is good enough to meet audience expectations of the portrayal, and one thing Inlet has been doing (apart from domino chains) is penning cynical letters to his former buzzwords of love, time and death.Now it's nearly Christmas, and 3 co-workers of Inlet's (Kate Winslett, Michael Peña and Edward Norton) decide that, if Dickens can have Marley's ghost call upon three spirits to change Scrooge, they can call upon 3 actors to confront and debate with Inlet in those roles of love, time and death! That's Gamble 2, as it's a bit whimsical, a bit James Stewart in the 1940s for 2017. For me it still works. Gamble number 3 is also present here, as our three mates of Inlet's - each of whom has major sadness issues of his/her own - come to the conclusion that, if these strange encounters don't pull Inlet out of his fugue, they can at least be used to prove that he's mad and unfit to run his (their) company. That's a peculiar ambiguity, and circumstances quickly conspire to ensure that it's more likely to be the second purpose that will serve than the first. None of the three want Inlet's company to go down, and they're prepared to be ruthless to save their own necks, basically sympathetic to Inlet as they may be.There's a tension in this plot-line certainly, but this doesn't ruin the film either. Indeed, the setting keeps being dragged back firmly into the no-nonsense world of contemporary New York, and some of the ""Big Apple"" shots are spectacular. And so to love, time and death, as played respectively by Keira Knightley, Maze Runner veteran singer-dancer-actor Jacob Latimore, and star of stage and screen Dame Helen Mirren. Since Naomie Harris also has a key role to play outside of this main line, but in close connection with it, the significant British input into this film will be clear, though only Keira retains her accent, Mirren struggles just a little with her American one, while Harris does the job seamlessly...As it turns out, each of our three figures has two encounters with Inlet (while Harris has several), but each encounter is short. Mostly ""Love"", ""Time"" and ""Death"" have just a couple of lines to deliver to him, often not even done with particularly tangible emotion. Yet, at the moment of delivery, this audience member had tears springing into his eyes without warning. Somewhere, somehow, (familiar) feelings of immense gravitas and importance had been summed up, and the effect was quite masterly. For my money, Latimore and Knightley are even better at this than Mirren, despite having less to say; but in general these are three fine performances - small as they may be in time-terms (that word again). Which brings us to gamble no. 4 that this film takes - the biggest of all. The death of a child is heavy, and - as I've indicated - this not the only life sadness present in this movie. Now a piece of this kind always faces three serious risks. Risk one is that the audience will experience such sadness that the effect of the story-telling instrument is blunted by over-emotion. Risk two is that there will be a rejection of melodrama, with audiences feeling goaded into ridiculing the content. In close connection with that, risk three is that people will feel their emotions have been exploited cynically. Of these three risks, I think it is 3 that ""Collateral Beauty"" comes closest to facing, if emerging triumphantly , and also - narrowly - avoiding the other two risks.Ultimately, ""Collateral Beauty"" keeps its feet in 2017, avoids ridiculous flights of fancy, conveys its message, and does not (quite) obscure that by descending into mawkish sentimentality. While (like the effective ""Me Before You""), ""Collateral Beauty"" comes with Rom-Com packaging, it is drama, if not entirely humourless. For me, this was uplifting overall, meaningful; skating on thin ice certainly, with its methods, but ultimately staying dry - unlike this reviewer's eyes, and those of most of his fellow cinema-goers, male and female. ""Collateral Beauty"" has a large twist (which worked with me), and (probably) also a couple of other ones, which may only come into one's head as one leaves the cinema. This is then far from a forgettable piece, despite what critics seem to suggest.",Collateral Beauty

(see why at the end) I won't spoil by revealing the two twists in the plot, this film will keep you guessing right up to very end, I doubt whether you'll guess the eventual outcome! An emotional tear jerking drama, with a Stella cast. But why does this film feature in so many top ten worst films of 2016? I can't understand the poor reviews this has attracted, why all the hate?I have seen this has been criticised for being yet another Will Smith 'OSCAR bait' film, but don't listen to the professional critics, I've seen enough rubbish in 2016 to know this isn't that bad. Will Smith's character writes letters to three things, the three pillars of life, he's suffering severe depression after a tragic loss. These letters are posted in order to reconcile his emotions and gain closure (it's in the trailer, so not a spoiler).He spirals deeper and deeper into depression and doesn't seem to care that his business is in jeopardy as well. Bereavement can't be dealt with as a 'sprint', more like a 'marathon', and the film depicts that well.If you want exploding cars and superheroes then this definitely isn't for you. If you want an emotional drama that's twistier than a twisty thing then you'll appreciate this. This film made my wife cry, and my wife is far from being a weepie kind of girl. This review deserves to be spoiler free, I hope I've managed that and I hope that I've managed to persuade you to go watch and decide for yourself? Thanks and Happy New Year",Collateral Beauty

57,CANpatbuck3664,Collateral Beauty Explores Deep Ideas and Boasts a Great Cast but They Are Undone by a Bad Central Premise and a Sappy Ending,4,14 March 2017,"*Minor Spoilers Ahead* At the start of the movie, we briefly meet Howard (Will Smith), Whit (Edward Norton), Claire (Kate Winslet) and Simon (Michael Pena) at a party to celebrate how well their advertising agency is doing. Although they are all essential parts of the agency, Howard is the charismatic leader of the bunch and he gets up to give an inspiring speech to the employees. He talks about the 3 abstractions that we all have in life: love, death and time and how they're the key to reaching people in advertising.We then flash to 3 years later and things have changed. Howard has unfortunately suffered the loss of his daughter to a rare form of cancer. He's obviously grief-stricken and he's a shell of his former self. He shows up to the office, he doesn't talk to anyone and spends his days building domino towers and knocking them down. The agency is losing clients hand-over-fist and Whit, Claire and Simon are panicking. They care about Howard but the agency is about to collapse and while they have a standing offer of a buyout from a competing firm, they can't get Howard to sign papers to authorize it. He has the controlling majority and his grief is preventing him from doing anything except writing letters to Death, Love and Time. In a desperate attempt to regain control of the company, they hire a group of actors: Brigitte (Helen Mirren), Raffi (Jacob Lattimore) and Amy (Keira Knightley) to impersonate these immeasurable concepts to prove that he's incompetent.I want to get what I liked about Collateral Beauty out of the way (there were things to like). This is a pretty impressive cast and they largely did what they could to elevate this film. The trailer for this movie is deceptive, Will Smith isn't actually the centre of this movie. Edward Norton, Michael Pena, Helen Mirren and Kate Winslet actually get the most screen time. Will Smith gets a lot of crap but he performed as well as he could with this character and the concept this movie is centred around. I found Michael Pena and Helen Mirren to be the most charming of the bunch. Naomie Harris, Keira Knightley, Kate Winslet, and Jacob Lattimore were all good with what they were given. I'd especially point out Harris who's always been really underrated and Lattimore who'd I'd never seen before. The only exception was Edward Norton who wasn't bad but he seemed to be coasting through this.The other aspect I liked was that there were a lot of good scenes where 2 of the characters were talking about the issues they were working through. The interactions were very honest and while the dialogue was a little spotty, with the cast they've assembled, you're watching some of the best in the world doing what they do best. So there were scenes in this movie that really stuck out and they were good enough to hold my interest through some of the problems I noticed with Collateral Beauty.The biggest problems I had with Collateral Beauty are spelled out in my title for this review. Much like another movie I saw fairly recently named Passengers, Collateral Beauty has a hard time getting around the central idea the plot is based on. I had a hard time at the end sympathizing with any of the characters. You feel for Will Smith because of his tragic loss but his life has devolved so far and his mindset is so broken to the point where he can't sign some papers to save his employees' jobs or keep his agency from collapsing? He deserves pity but with so much time passing, what needs to be done requires so little of him that I couldn't believe he wouldn't do it. You also can't side with his friends or the actors/actresses they hired because the bottom line is that they're tricking/railroading an emotionally/mentally broken man. If you actually consider they're actions, I could honestly see this pushing him that much closer to a possible suicide. You understand why they're doing this but they're actions as a group were playing with fire in a dangerous situation.The other thing with Collateral Beauty is that while the movie largely turned out to be okay, the ending twist ruined almost any bit of goodwill I had towards it. It was relatively believable, the way events unfold leave certain things in the plot unanswered. Admittedly, the ending does clear those things up. The movie walks a fine line between genuine emotion and eye-rolling sentimentality and the tower they build topples into corniness with that plot twist. To me it just came off as way too in-your-face and they overdid the drama completely.This movie could have had the best of intentions and I would believe it completely. It deals with heavy subject matter and I think the cast did as good of a job as they could have. This movie just didn't work and I largely fall on the side of the critics. If this turns out to be your thing (I could see it working for some people, I think it will reach people who have experienced deep and personal loss) that's fine but in the end I couldn't connect with this movie.",Collateral Beauty

I had to suspend disbelief in a major way to accept that...well, I won't finish my thought because it will spoil the film.I can't say that the film delivered the profound insights I thought it would. The insights about ""profound connection to everything"" and ""collateral beauty"" were lost on me, really. They weren't adequately developed in the movie. I do feel that I have a better understanding of what it is like to lose a child.I think maybe this is a film that was all over the place.The script and plot were just not at the same quality level as the star-studded cast.

59,CineMuseFilms,A complex lyrical essay on grief psychosis,7,13 March 2017,"Every now and then the movie commentariat gets it wrong. Bad movies earn bad reviews, but it is something else entirely when a movie that is not bad receives universal condemnation. Last year that honour went to Collateral Beauty (2016), the most misread movie of recent times. Ignoring the fact that its cast includes Will Smith, Helen Mirren, Kate Winslet and Keira Knightly, actors not known for lending their names to C-grade flops, the question must be put: why does this film get such a bum rap?Some of the problem starts with the label on the product. When we buy a ticket to a contemporary 'drama romance' our senses are tuned for the usual genre tropes and conventions that help us interpret a film. If Collateral Beauty was labelled 'magical realism' the outcome might have been worse despite the more accurate label. This genre offers an essentially realistic view of life but it incorporates elements of magic, fantasy or the supernatural. Unprepared, viewers can misread the cues and thus mis-read the film. Put simply, Collateral Beauty is an essay on grief psychosis that is made bearable by framing its premise around magical realism.At a superficial level, the plot is straightforward. Howard (Will Smith) used to be a charismatic leader of a very successful advertising agency until, two years ago, he lost his six-year old daughter. He cannot come to terms with her death, his marriage is shattered and the agency is in trouble, while he cannot even speak the words ""my daughter Olivia died of cancer"". Seeking catharsis, he writes letters to three abstract entities, Death, Time, and Love. But his letters are intercepted by a private investigator hired by his colleagues who want to either shake him out of his depressive stupor or have him certified unfit to run the company. Three actors representing Death, Time, and Love are hired to confront Howard and goad him to externalise his suppressed grief. They convince him that nobody else can see them although each encounter is secretly filmed as evidence. Each of his three colleagues have personal dramas in their own lives, as do each of the three actors hired to confront him, and of course his therapist has problems of her own. In terms of narrative structure, films do not get more complicated than this.If the structure is not sufficiently perplexing, there are frequent non-signposted transitions between layers of reality that leave viewers uncertain that what they are seeing is actually happening rather than a figment of a disturbed mind. Despite excellent acting from a stellar cast and a brisk pace of storytelling, this film presents insurmountable challenges for viewers wanting easy entertainment. However, what has been described by most critics as a total mess of a film is, for this reviewer, a lyrical fable of mixed realities that reflect the turmoil inside Howard's head. When he first utters those words he could not speak, it is gut-wrenching.If this film was re-imagined with the cast in 17th Century costumes and Howard as the innkeeper of the best establishment in the land, with the three actors, Death, Time, and Love played as ephemerals that materialised and then disappeared, it would be described as a universal tale of Shakespearean proportions. But instead, it is a highly original story in an age where originality is hard to find. It is also a complex, challenging, and deeply thought-provoking story capable of reaching deep inside your soul, if only you let it.",Collateral Beauty

Damage to organs are a suitable place to start in existence because from the earliest days of humanity organs failed or were made to fail through wars but here we can explore the meaning of preserving those moments by excepting that peace governs us. 
Peace to countries like Pakistan from India; peace to call them home. Peace to bring soldiers in foreign lands home; because troubles like being in an air raid because the government is under terrorist ties brings nations like France and United States of America to perform strikes on Lebanon and Syria. 
Regimes are overthrown by the space of a decade and peace prevails but being in the third world it is hard to bring home the effects that we are peaceful like the countries of the first worlds. Relevant points of searching for life after death through means of peace can be traced to primal humans because they were in the moment. 
Momentary gain like achieving a pass mark in an exam brings joy and peace contrary to violence and disobedience under Boko Haram or Al Quaida. Terrorism does not exist; finding a terrorist within brings another to share your basic life style.

65,kaptenvideo-89875,Will Smith wants to get serious,5,3 January 2017,"It has been said that the producers originally wanted ""Collateral Beauty"" to join this year's end's awards race but ultimately decided against it. Looking at the big names starring here – Will Smith, Helen Mirren, Edward Norton, Kate Winslet, Michael Peña, Keira Knightley, Naomie Harris – one just has to ask: how bad can it be? To avoid the awards race, I mean. At least it's still released in December, as an antidote to much more popular sci-fi actioneer ""Rogue One: A Star Wars Story"".Well, let's look at it this way. The movie has enough going on for it to catch attention. Really cool cast, intriguing trailers showing Will Smith talking to abstact supernatural beings such as Death, Time and Love... I also liked the ending although if it does not evolve from the previous plot naturally. And when have you ever seen lots of domino bricks toppling on each other without being at least a little bit impressed? They have quite a few of those scenes, right from the beginning.The only troubling note I could foresee is the duration of the movie, which is a measly 97 minutes. Since when any self-respecting glamorous Hollywood project of modern times has been satisfied with less than two hours, or something close to it?And then it happens. Many of the watchers will probably notice soon that they are not not actually enjoying themselves much. For all the ambitions to offer a poignant story about loss, pain and being humane to each other, the result is just... not there. It's too sappy and bland, characters feel like vague shapes than real human beings and the whole plot can be called pretty manipulative.There's actually two kinds of people who I can imagine actively enjoying this: (1) the ones who have not seen a lot of American movies but quite like them, (2) little girls of all ages or sexes. To put it more bluntly: ""Collateral Beauty"" is for this sweet little girl in all of us. I am talking about this joyous abstract being who can still believe that acting nice makes one essentially a good person, no matter the actual deeds, and always pays off in the end. After all, it's, of course, a suitable direction for what is essentially a Christmas movie disguised as ""Will Smith getting serious project"".Speaking of the handsome devil, this role is very suitable for where the leading man Will Smith currently is with his movie making career. Just as his character has lost all passion for all the seemingly sunny and successful life that has come before, I don't actually remember seeing Smith in a movie and thinking that he must be satisfied with acting for quite some time. Maybe he's really enjoying himself in ""Suicide Squad"", haven't seen that one yet.To some degree, it certainly hurts ""Collateral Beauty"" that Will Smith has always been more of a strong performer than notable actor, even given better material. He's always been adequate and he will not sink the ship here, but he's just... not that good.I guess it helps a little that Smith uses little bodily movements and tics to convey the overwhelming emotional pain buried inside the character. But he's far from having a convincing, effortless dramatic role presence as some of his colleagues here, mostly Harris, Peña and the ever-great Mirren.Maybe it's just me... but I have noticed that sometimes movie makers use this trick to compensate for the mediocre performance of the star. They give him as little dialogue as possible and let him just lurk around, so the screen colleagues and overall atmosphere can make him look better. Remember, say, Eminem in ""8 Mile""? This seems to be also the case here but sadly the material is not as interesting to really make it work.""Collateral Beauty"" doesn't offer much in the way of authentic emotions, nor exciting roles from talented cast included here. But as just a Christmas movie for a little girl in all of us, it's quite OK. It looks certainly pretty, which can be confused with good sometimes, when the audience is feeling generous.By the way, Will Smith is appearing next in ""Bright"", some Netflix- produced fantasy that is still mostly held under wraps. The plus here is magnificent director David Ayer known for achieving frightening authenticity with his actors, as in ""Harsh Times"" or ""End of Watch"". I really liked ""Fury"", too. So if there's someone who can give Smith his mojo back, maybe it's Ayer.And if even this will not work out, ""Bad Boys"" 3 ja 4 seem to be on schedule for 2018 and 2019, repectively. Surely Smith can do good with the series that made him a proper movie star?",Collateral Beauty
66,nicolechan916,Heart-rending,7,28 December 2016,"There is more to this film than meets the eye, and while I was thoroughly thrown off guard by its many intricacies, and by the ending, the emotional connection fell short for me. It might just be me, as I don't show my emotions much, and am not easily affected by others. But the chemistry between the characters are OK at best, not great. My friend on the other hand, cried about three times while watching this; I think both of us are on opposite sides of the spectrum.The acting is pretty great, as Smith portrays the figure of a grieving father in pain incredibly well. The emotions he displays, and the hurt you can see in his eyes, is remarkable. Other supporting actors do their part well too, though not as strong emotions emit from them. At first, Knightley didn't stand out to me and I was a little disappointed by her acting, but when she had that final confrontation with Howard, that was an amazing scene. It might have been all the cuts in the film which detracted from the emotional climb for me, as there are many characters, and the movie cuts here and there. Not so drastically that it is disruptive, but enough so that there isn't much emotional climax. At least for me anyway. Having said that, I did enjoy how the movie seems to be straightforward and almost cliché like, but turns out to be something different. So, I applaud the way in which it has been put together, through the directing and storytelling. Dealing with such a vulnerable and tragic topic, the movie explores the depth of human emotions, and how the lives of those around are affected. Overall, it is a pretty great drama to watch.",Collateral Beauty
67,ferdinand1932,Constant Dyspepsia,3,26 February 2017,"This movie comes with a reputation for its unintended consequences. This is not entirely fair. The film is not particularly egregious and is quite typical of its kind. It lacks a plot, the story is superficial and predictable. It is rather like a short story written by a sensitive adolescent who yearns to write deep and ever so meaningful things about life and love and how we are all connected and it's so wondrous. Golly gosh!In other ways it is like the American remake of Wings of Desire. Where the German film was written with care and precision, setting a line between the boundaries of existence and eternity, the American remake was a sickly, mawkish, obvious work which traded on the idea for a cable television weepie.Almost aware of its weak premise, Collateral Beauty occasionally pricks at its platitudes but that doesn't convince because the work is based on bad writing. This is apparent in the title, an illiterate clanger, which is picked apart in the film for its failings as an incomprehensible oxymoron. Yet, we are asked to continue believing in something that is flawed. It may be that in years to come this film is adored and constantly on rotation on some new media platform, as yet uninvented. ""It's a Wonderful Life"" had bad reviews on release and it grew into an overly loved piece of schlock with the same level of noxious banalities. The possibly is there but if so future viewers are warned to have tissues and stomach medication handy for frequent involuntary regurgitations.",Collateral Beauty
68,FelipeCarrillo,"I Still Do Not Apprehend What Is ""Collateral Beauty""",5,22 January 2017,"Love, time and Death are the three abstractions connecting each human being with existence nature, they regulate our steps in the earthly world and rule a concatenation of situations personally related to a superhuman religious power. Based on these three conceptualizations, Christmas wager of Warner Bros. seeks to provide a life-giving message through the long-drawn-out dose of lachrymose content that after all it just got is to try the audience's patience and supply a wrong composition and emphatically distant to what it is proposed.Howard (Will Smith) opens with a poignant speech about the life pillars, in which manifests optimism and vitality of being in command of an increasing advertising agency. Two years later, a downcast man by depression, fatherly devastation, sadness and melancholy appears on screen, usually with an affliction frown and about to immerse himself into a fit of tears. According to his ""colleagues,"" the persistent emotional fluctuation of their chief—he spends the most time stacking up multicolored domino pieces in the form of small forts or constructions for symbolizing each individual fate: everyone will crumble; —is going to make to collapse their advertising company abruptly. To prevent this happening, and with the subterfuge of seeking his social, personal and labor rehabilitation; they determine to hire a group of actors to embody three characters whose their boss sends rejection letters: Love, Time and Death. They are portrayed by Jacob Latimore (Raffi), Keira Knightley (Amy) and an unexpected Helen Mirren (Brigitte) within a deeply unlike role to her triumphant career. All this in order to save the company, redeeming their ""colleague"" and suddenly saving their own lives, each one related to the existing pillars interpreted by the actors.I have to confess that in mid-2015, when I gradually found out about the cast and crew was quite elated and anxious to visualize the suggestive design starring these experienced actors, however, when I slid down on the screen and read the storyline, my expectation was accentuated uncompromisingly. I felt that it was what every film lover demands with devotion in these times of creative vicissitudes; an original story, with unique qualities and fine resolutions.Today, one year and a half later, I have the opportunity to see the film in its entirety, triggering a forceful change of opinion both subjective and objective. First, I noticed an air of magic realism that works to some extent; trying to play with viewers' mind is certainly detrimental since if it does not run with a rigorous and acute diplomacy can cause a powerful cataclysm, and precisely that was what happened to this feature film. In addition to that fanciful aura into a realistic conception of the world—which is far from generating a consistent empathy with the public, —Allan Loeb's script provides a figurative and utopian searching, shuffling the story desire within the three supporting characters: Whit, Claire, and Simon (Edward Norton, Kate Winslet and Michael Peña). While it conglomerates subplots in the story, Howard, the true leading role, moves to the last place, dragging the course of the occurrences out and trying to be a competent work influenced by philosophical issues. Besides this, the staging does not suggest high conception of imagination or invention, adhering to New York in full holiday season, repetitive close-ups of misty-eyed Will Smith, editing of uneven pace and a soundtrack as generic as deficient for jam-packed dramatic moments, which there are every minute.Despite the constant detriments, the film acquires and retains a stimulating ether around the leitmotiv: trying to bring back a loved one. Playing Love, Time and Death of crystal-clear, but at the same time multiple ways is one of their few skills, even getting to arouse fervor with the cardinal aim of the characters. In addition, the task of giving sense to existence reminds us of the classics which managed more than honoring and paying tribute to life itself: ""Life Is Beautiful"" or ""The Pursuit of Happiness"" (starring Smith in 2006).""Collateral Beauty"", directed by David Frankel, feels as the definitive collapse of a joint of erroneous decisions about giving shape to a story, however, above film or narrative standards, the movie is a good choice for those who wish to reaffirm the importance of life, time, death and love.Packed with talented stars, a fortifying central plot and a suggestive final twist, Frankel's celluloid does not deserve such reprimand by movie critics. Is it a confusing and irregular motion picture? Yes, it is, but if we are going to talk together about real dud movies, several heads already lean out.",Collateral Beauty
69,Avwillfan89,Not the way to do it.,4,28 February 2017,"This film got absolutely skinned alive by the critics. And I can kind of see their point. The story focuses on Will Smith's character Howard, who is on complete lock down after the tragic death of his daughter. He creates domino buildings and writes to Time, Love and Death (a reference to speech he made in the beginning before his daughter died) His three friends (Norton, Winslet and Pena) are struggling to keep their company alive as Howard won't commit to his work, or even talk. So they devise a plan that will make it appear that Howard is insane in order to sell their company. They do that by hiring three struggling actors to pretend they are Time, Love and Death and filming it with the actors edited out. If this sounds utterly wrong, it is. Seeing Howard's three best friends gaslight him the way they do in the film is pretty hard to watch. Keira Knightley's character repeatedly states that what they're doing is horrible and morally wrong. And she's right. And there are no real comeuppances to the act. When a movie isn't sure how it's marketed, or if it wants to be a comedy or a drama, you know it's going to get a thrashing. I personally loved seeing the actors, but the script is so paper-thin, superficial and misguided in its message, it slowly becomes more and more cringe-worthy.Finally, the trailer for this film presents a COMPLETELY different story to the one we see. But even if it did play out the way we thought we did, it still would have been terrible. It pushes too hard to be sentimental and forced that it feels rammed down your throat. There's a lot of wasted talent in this. Too bad.",Collateral Beauty

71,kingofdanerds,"I mean, I am not as angry as some with this movie",5,7 October 2020,"Well well well. What we have here is another Will Smith drama that seems to get negative reception from critics and praise from audiences (at least most of them). Collateral Beauty was released in 2016 and as mentioned, recieved mostly negative reception and even recieved a nomination at the Razzies. The film did alright at the box office. The film stars Will Smith, Edward Norton, Keira Knightley, Michael Pena, Kate Winslet and Helen Mirren (just to name a few).We see Howard (played by Will Smith) grieving over the loss of his daughter. He is single and works at this advertising agency or something and his friends/coworkers are noticing that he is not himself. (Of course he lost his kid). They basically follow and send a private investigator to figure out what he does with his life. They find out that he writes letters to love, time, and death. Howard's friends go and find some actors to portray love, time, and death in the hopes that they can bring Howard back into the real world.Well......... I have seen reviews of this film where people absolutely rip this film apart. (Check out Stoned Gremlin Production's Midnight Screening video of this film). But, I can see why people would hate this film. But I am not gonna waste my anger on this film. First of all, what good is there in this film? Well, Will Smith is pretty decent in this film. Also, this film can be emotional at times (even though if you think about it, this film shouldn't). But even though this film can be emotional, it is not very often. (Actually, there was only once with Michael Pena's character). Other than that, the film was well.......... not great. First of all, this film just has people who are probably the sickest of people who go and try to make this guy think that he is crazy. It is wrong and it is sick. There are two big plot twists that I didn't like just for the fact is that one of the plot twists completely makes previous conversations and scenes completely meaningless. The other plot twist makes sense in way I guess, but at the same time, it is just stupid. I suppose it is interesting that these people who hire these actors to portray Love, Time, and Death expect to help their friend but these actors end up helping them. The cast here consists of actors/actresses that are fairly well known and have appeared in better films and have acted far better as well. Again, Will Smith did a pretty good job here. Another complaint that seems to be in everyone's negative reviews of this film is the misleading trailer. I have not watched it (nor did I see a trailer for it in 2016). Does this film manage to portray grief well here? I don't think so but that is me. I have seen people actually get something from this film but I just did not get anything from this film at all.Overall, this film is not great. There are some things that were good but the things that are bad can be really annoying at times. I didn't get much out of this film but I do believe some people got something out of this film.",Collateral Beauty

My only advice would be to say go and watch it like I did low expectations and you just might be pleasantly surprised by how moved you were by the drama like I was.

73,lnvicta,Will Smith is sad for 90 minutes,3,10 October 2019,"Misguided, mean-spirited, melodramatic, and saccharine; Collateral Beauty is manufactured Oscar bait. The performances are all solid. Everything else is a disaster.Will Smith is our protagonist I guess? He doesn't do much but mope around teary-eyed the entire movie. Apparently his daughter died, but we never see their relationship and we don't know much about Will Smith's character before he's in complete mourning. The real plot is Ed Norton, Kate Winslet, and Michael Pena trying to squeeze him out of their company. They want to make Will Smith's character look crazy, so they hire three actors to portray love, time, and death. See, Howard (Will Smith) writes letters to love, time, and death, blaming them for his daughter's death and other general bad things, so their evil plan is to film Howard talking to the actors, then digitally remove the actors from the footage so it looks like Howard is talking to himself. That way, he'll be removed from the company and the three of them will get his equity.This movie doesn't work for many reasons. One, as I mentioned we really don't know Howard's character. He's sad. He cries a lot. He misses his daughter. He writes distraught letters to theoreticals. That's it. We're given no chance to relate to the character because his only characteristic is ""I'm sad"".Two, the trio of business partners are despicable. A lot of time is spent on them setting up scenarios to humiliate Howard and constantly colluding behind his back, yet we're asked to sympathize with them when they show Ed Norton's strained relationship with his daughter, or introduce the fact that Michael Pena is sick. Who cares? These are horrible people. They make very little effort in trying to console Howard or even talk to him. Everything is behind is back even though he's apparently the creative force of the company.Three, there is little to no interaction between Howard and the trio of scumbags. At one point Howard calls Whit (Norton) his best friend. Nothing in the movie indicated that they were friends, or even that they liked each other. They have one awkward interaction in the elevator, but we're just supposed to take the movie's word that they are dear friends. Howard spends most of his time with a girl he meets at a grief counseling class. We're barely given a chance to care about their relationship either because so much time is spent on the stupid business plot.There is only one scene that had all four main characters that I can remember and it was the ""climax"" of the film. Again, we care about none of these characters and what should feel cathartic just comes across as phony and contrived. This is a miserable movie that tries to come across as good-natured and profound. It's neither. It's grief porn, basically.I can't think of a single reason to recommend this movie. Maybe if you're trying to fall asleep, Collateral Beauty could help.",Collateral Beauty
74,SpoilerAlertReviews,Gets lost but hit refresh and ponder the collateral beauty of it.,8,29 December 2016,"The Devil Wears Prada and Marley & Me director, David Frankel gives us another intriguing drama. He tends to makes films about subjects not so to everyone's tastes but you end up watching it anyway. And, gladly so. The Devil Wears Prada was one of my favourite films of 2006. The story is centred around Howard, Will Smith, an advertising executive who was once full of life but now suffering from heavy bereavement, after tragically losing his daughter. Even though the story is pivotal to Howard, it's superbly balanced with the rest of the cast, so much so, I would say no one is headline star here, being a film similar to Crash, Adaptation or Magnolia in terms of balance. We mostly see how Howard's relationships are affected by his recline from society, mostly all work related and their knock-on affects, which poses a few key moral dilemmas. Norton, Winslet and Peña being his trusted colleagues/friends, each having their own issues whilst trying to juggle the future of their company with lack of leadership from Howard. Howard writes three letters, each addressed to Death, Time and Love, literally protesting their existence and purpose feeling betrayed by each of them. What happens next, is a little disappointing, but without giving anything away, the three respond in personified person and what starts off as a disappointment actually turns into wonderment as the scheme plays out. Mirren, Knightley and young Jacob Latimore play the three entities that visit Howard in almost Dicken's fashion, like A Christmas Carol. And whilst all give strong performances it's Norton, Mirren and Latimore who shine. Especially Latimore having to act against and amongst such great actors and he does a brilliant job. How does a fresh actor go about intimidating Will Smith, unless you're Margot Robbie of course. Smith displays similar faces of emotion from Seven Pounds, and whilst he is powerful in parts it wasn't enough to be fully engaging. It's almost automated to like any movie with Mirren in and she's does her part well, but again, like Smith, it's not Oscar worthy and Norton does outstanding as expected. Maybe it's because of how the film is structured and balanced, not allowing the characters to be fully explored. We realise it isn't just about Howard, but about connection, the people around us, the Collateral Beauty. And though at some stage I felt like I was missing something, or that the film wasn't making clear sense, it does eventually blossom into something heartfelt. Theodore Shapiro does an elegant and beautiful score, instantly hitting home with emotion. It's a score I can reflect with, finding it inspiring. The soundtrack is minimal but amazing use of Fink's track ""Looking Too Closely"" and OneRepublic providing the end credit track ""Let's Hurt Tonight"" It's not the first time Frankel makes a film this at first feels like it loses it's way. It's poetic, crisp and smart but does lack the immediate impact. However once you think about it and connect all the dots, you figure out it's full glory. It's certainly a film not just will watch again, but want to watch again.

75,rutzelb,Powerful and Touching,9,19 March 2017,"Advertising CEO Howard (Will Smith) lost his daughter to cancer 2- yrs ago and cannot function in a business sense. His partners are concerned and want to sell as the company is losing accounts. They decide to hire actors who will act as Love, Time and Death as those are the entities Howard writes letters to. They hope one of the actors will get through to Howard. But unknown to his partners, Howard goes to Madeline's (Naomi Harris) therapy session where parents have lost a child. Howard knows he needs to set his head straight. Madeline tells Howard she lost a child to cancer and she was 6-yrs old and her name was Olivia. She asks Howard, more than once, what was the name of his daughter and Howard does not reply. This is very powerful and touching and you may need a box of Kleenex at times. The actors who portray Love: Amy (Keira Knightley); Time: Raffi (Jacob Latimore) and Death: and Brigitte (Helen Mirren) do their best to convince Howard to snap out of it and later a video will be shown of them conversing with Howard but they will be digitally removed from the video so it will look like Howard is talking to someone no one else can see. The video will be shown to potential buyers of the company to show that Howard is not capable of voting to keep the company. Howard's partners are: Edward Norton as Whit; Kate Winslet as Claire; and Michael Pena as Simon. A sort of comic relief concerns Whit and his estranged daughter Allison (Kylie Rogers) as she believes Whit's infidelity with her mother caused the divorce and she wants nothing to do with him. Later, acting upon advice from Howard, we see Whit taking charge and finally getting through to Allison. These scenes are pure gold. We see a major twist (No one saw coming, right?) later when Howard visits Madeline on Christmas Eve and this is where you will really need that box of Kleenex.There may be a question you may have regarding Brigitte and the question is this: Is she really Death?

(Think Sixth Sense and you'll see what I mean.)Outstanding actress is Helen Mirren who lifts the entire movie with her presence. I'm also a great Edward Norton fan and he is superb here, too.So, should you see it? Without a doubt - Yes! But prepare to be manipulated if you're a thinker/analyser.

But alas all my hope was destroyed after watching the film. Casting is all there is to in this film, but there is no real story. Everyone is dying in the film or having a major crisis in life, everyone is crying all the time. Somehow the managed to gather all the saddest people on earth in one film. Even in scenes where there is no need for tear they put extra effort to make it emotional, Like writer made the final confrontation scene with Whit (Edward Norton) and his daughter unnecessarily touchy and teary while it was genuinely a upbeat scene then it would have been far better scene. I think it was the writer's mission to made an emotional film but by overdoing it he made a sad and pathetic film.As there are so many great people in the film writer tried to give everyone an important role no one had time to build her/his character so that character could have any impact on the viewers' mind.

79,Davalon-Davalon,Helen Mirren is the best thing in it,2,11 August 2021,"While there may have been a truly interesting concept in this story, I do not want to watch Will Smith mope around for 90 minutes. That's basically all he does.The movie asks viewers to keep 1) a lot of characters straight in their heads and 2) to understand some bizarre subplot about Will Smith's company and its impending takeover because he can't accept reality.The characters and subplot were really distracting. There were a few fun, funny moments, but in all I felt that all the actors, except Helen Mirren, were just ""acting."" I didn't feel connected to anything or anyone, nor did I care.To lose a young child as a parent, which is the thrust of the Will Smith character's story, is of course devastating. The fact that he was willing to take the whole world down with him while he suffered his grief, not to mention riding straight into traffic (in the hopes that he would be killed so he wouldn't have go on living in pain?) were not entertaining, enlightening, uplifting, moving, or anything else that the creators of this strange world were clearly certain that people were going to feel.Tons of questions abound, but for starters, why would Oscar winner Kate Winslet take on what is clearly an insignificant supporting role? Also, she is paired with Jacob Latimore (talentless as ""Time"") -- and there is absolutely no chemistry or connection between them. Zilch.Michael Peña, as one of Will Smith's colleagues, gives a completely flat, emotionless performance. I have no idea why he is in this film, because he doesn't bring anything to it.Edward Norton plays a borderline creepy weirdo who quickly becomes obsessed with Keira Knightly (""Love""), even though we are made to understand that he cheated on his (unseen) wife and basically lost custody of his child (a very talented Kylie Rogers). I'm unclear why we were supposed to root for him. He has one scene with Mary Beth Piel, who plays his Mum. Half her image is basically cut out for the first half of the scene, and then for the second half of the scene, we can see this talented actress go from a conspiracy-filled Alzheimer's patient to a loving mother in a snap. She was interesting. But... ultimately... why was she in it? It was pointless.Will Smith is obviously a movie star. He has presence. He has that magic and that sparkle. But in this film, it's all washed away and you just have this sad, angry man. I'm unclear how the creators thought we, the audience, wanted to sit through what amounts to a 90-minute therapy session as ""Howard"" (Will's character) finally ""breaks through"" and reconnects with his (surprise!) wife ""Madeline"" (Naomie Harris, doing the best she could with the lines she was given).There were also numerous scenes of domino-esque rectangles that had been constructed into amazing formations, only to be destroyed by the flick of a finger. These were fun and might even have been more entertaining than the entire film. But Helen Mirren's few moments on screen were entertaining and again, that's the only reason this disaster received 2 stars from me.",Collateral Beauty

82,samuelding85,Seeking the Emotional Connections,6,14 January 2017,"What is 'collateral beauty'? Not many will know about this term, which director David Frankel is using this term as his theme for his latest feature film. Howard (Will Smith) is a successful entrepreneur who runs a media agency together with his three best friends: Whit (Edward Norton), Claire (Kate Winslet) and Simon (Michael Pena). After losing his daughter to a rare brain tumor, he drowns himself in sorrow and isolates himself at work and personal life. An encounter with Amy (Keira Knightley) leads Whit, Claire and Simon came across with a struggling theatrical group which was co-run bu Bridgette (Helen Mirren) and Raffi (Jacob Latimore). Howard's friend intercepted three letters written by him, which the recipient turns out to be: Death, Love and Time. To assist Howard coming out from grief and sorrow, his friends engage the help of Bridgette, Amy and Raffi to play the role of death, love and time respectively. Meanwhile, an encounter with Madeleine (Naomie Harris), the founder of a self-help group for parents who have lost their children to death makes Howard decided to start life all over again. When the trio (Bridgette, Amy and Raffi appear in the form of death, love and time) appears in Howard's life, it makes him question the meaning of life and the importance of overcoming the grief. The term 'collateral beauty' can be simply defined as parents unable to see the damage of their child's death in full picture, but the love and beauty that comes after the death helps to bring people closer to one another. Frankel explores the definition in the film through the connections between the people around Howard. Here, we have seen how Howard has isolated himself from the outside world, which worries his loved ones and his friends (damage). Through the intervention of Bridgette's trio, it helps Howard to pick up the courage to restart his life, while at the same time seeking the possibility of connecting with Madeleine and give himself a second chance in life. Looking at the bigger picture, Frankel also touches on the life of the people surrounding Howard: Whit is patching up his broken relationship with his ex-wife's daughter, Allison, to redeem his infidelity; Claire is seeking a sperm donor to conceive a child due to her age after spending most of her time establishing the career for Howard; Simon fears his family will be unable to support themselves financially after a relapse of cancer he has recovered. The subplot supports the story to move on, which it only helps the audience to understand the term, but also shifts the focus on Howard's grief to avoid boredom. While these subplots seems to be valid and reflects the actual life an individual will encounter, it may be heavy for some who are seeking to entertain than to reflect on their life. Towards the end of the story, audience can feel that emotional toils takes the center stage of the story, though it is not much of an emotional roller-coaster ride. Smith carries the same usual self from his previous films in the similar genre, such as The Pursuit of Happiness, Seven Pounds and Concussion. Though he is the main focus of the story, he has unfortunately unable to engage the audience in the emotional toil he has been through. Not much explanation was given on Smith's Howard wallowing in sorrow, which audience may not be convinced on what has happened, which leads to the undesired behavior he displays when his friend is helping him. Instead, the focus has shifted to Helen Mirren's Bridgette, which she came in as a form of enlightenment to Howard. Besides applying her theatrical knowledge to the role she was given to, her age and appearance have also help the role to look more convincing without too much giveaway. At duration of 97 minutes, there isn't much room for Norton, Winslet, Pena, Knightley, Latimore and Harris to explore their respective roles. The casting is strong to draw the crowds, but it seems to be a waste since not much chance was given to explore the role.

84,antoniokowatsch,Too bland,3,11 February 2017,"This movie isn't exactly profound in nature. It tries to be but ultimately fails once you realize that the entire premise of the movie is that ""trauma"" can be overcome by an abundance of lies (from close ones). I kid you not. At the end of the day it ultimately boils down to the moral compass of the viewer. If you're in the ""the ends justify the means""-camp you'll definitely like this movie. But if you don't subscribe to this moral paradigm you will have a hard time liking this particular flick. This entire movie is basically about a guy who is ""beaten down by life"" because of his daughters death and all that his ""supposed"" friends do is lie and deceive him to further their own careers. What turned out to be exceptionally surprising was the way in which most of the protagonists talked about and handled money. They seemed very out of touch with reality.Also, the movie itself is technically a great deception. It tries to nonchalantly justify the wrongdoings of the protagonists by highlighting the positive outcome that ensued. Very Machiavellian.And to top it all off the ending was made deliberately confusing. As a matter of fact some might even call it ridiculous in the truest sense of the word. I know, I'm being very nebulous in my telling but you'll understand what I mean once you watch the movie.",Collateral Beauty

This is not to say Collateral Beauty is a failure. It explores one of the biggest questions in all our lives. What is your Why? Why do you get up in the morning etc. Plus we get to meet Love, Death and Timethe three quintessential elements of life. In the words of singer Marcia Hines, ""This show is deep"". And what a cast with Edward Norton, Kate Winslet, Helen Mirren, Kierra Knightley and more. You'll laugh, you'll cry, you'll sigh! Isn't that how any movie should engage with it's audience?",Collateral Beauty
87,WooderIce64,Complete train wreck of a movie,3,4 August 2021,"One of the best things that film can do as a medium that no other can is that it can convey the human condition on a scale that is digestible but connects to the audience on an emotional level. When a film crew manages to put together an emotional moment that makes an audience cry, it can be a very special thing, but it must be done with utmost care and precision. Collateral Beauty is a movie that attempts to be just that but fails miserably in virtually every regard. It's about Howard (Will Smith), an advertising executive whose life is turned upside down by the death of his six-year-old daughter. His co-workers, Ed Norton, Kristen Dunst, and Michael Pena, see him writing letters to love, time, and death and get actors to respond to him as those characters. With a subject matter as heavy as the death of a child, it's something that must be handled extremely well to work. It doesn't.This movie is master class in bad writing. It's sappy, preachy, heavily clichéd, has no clear message, thinks it's deep but isn't, and has some awfully written moments of what can only be assumed to be levity. The character arcs range from non-existent to barely fleshed out. Some of them are one note cliches (most notably Edward Norton's character), while others aren't even there at all, and are mostly acknowledged through throwaway lines (in this case mainly Kirsten Dunst's character). It also has this sort of plot twist at the end that opens way more questions than were previously present. Worst of all, the whole idea is that it's supposed to be this uplifting message of hope, which it does quite the opposite of. There's not a single ray of light in this dark, depressing film. At the end of the movie, virtually nothing changes in terms of Howard's grieving process. It's one of those movies that thinks it's some sort of deep intellectual thing to say, but it really doesn't by any means.There are some good things here. The acting from the top-of-the-line cast was generally good. Smith had his moments where the grief clearly weighed down on him. Helen Mirren and Kiera Knightley were both very good in their roles as death and love. Seeing Michael Pena in a serious role was interesting, and he played it well. The movie is conceptually interesting, and I give it credit for that. It would have been better if it was a magical realist film, in which love, time, and death literally appeared to him and only him. Without that mystical element, the idea of them hiring actors seems unnecessarily cruel, and makes Norton, Dunst, and Pena the worst of friends. I guess you could say that for them, this whole thing was little more than collateral damage.",Collateral Beauty
88,antoniatejedabarros,"A strong & deep film that talks about parenthood, love, life & death. Don't expect car races, fights, guns & superficiality! Will's performance is BREATHTAKING!",10,25 December 2016,"Amy / Love (Keira Knightley): ""I'm the reason for everything. If you can accept that, then maybe you get to live again"".I have read some bad reviews about this amazing film. I doubt that all those people who left bad reviews are parents who have experienced the indescribable, gigantic & unconditional love that a mother or a father feels for his/her children. Clearly, they didn't get the film. Also, this is a movie of many layers: there are many turns and twists, and that's what makes this movie brilliant. But apparently only few people got the story. Collateral Beauty is a beautiful, strong & deep movie that talks about parenthood, love, life & death. Don't expect car races, fights, guns & superficiality! This is a movie that will make you think, will make you cry and will make you learn to accept the tragedies of life.Collateral Beauty arrived to Spain on December 23, and I was dying to go and see it, because I am a huge fan of Will Smith. I find him very cool, sexy and fascinating: he is handsome, he is exciting, he is funny, and he is artistic. But the most sexy thing that I found about Will is that he is a loving father and a loving husband. As much as I love to see his muscles and his beautiful smile in movies like Bad Boys, Men in Back, Wild Wild West, Ali, I, Robot, Hitch, I Am Legend or Focus, I must say that my favorite Will movie is, definitely, The Pursuit of Happiness. Finally, I couldn't go to the cinema that Friday, because I have three children (A girl, a boy and a little girl, ages 10, 8, and 3) and I had to bring them to the swimming pool and to Taekwondo, so I ran to the cinema only yesterday, Saturday the 24th. And I loved the film.I stopped watching Trailers before having watched the movie, because the Trailers really ruin the movie for you. So, I didn't have a clue regarding what Collateral Beauty was about, and I was very touched and surprised.Will's performance in Collateral Beauty is breathtaking! He is phenomenal. His eyes have so much pain and so much sadness that you can really feel his sorrow. Edward Norton is OK, Kate Winslet finally managed to get her American accent right (it took her almost 20 years!), and Michael Peña is good enough. I loved the fact that Keira Knightley kept her British accent, Jacob Latimore (I didn't know him) is great, and Helen Mirren and Naomie Harris are absolutely amazing (Naomie is an spectacular actress: saw her in Mandela: Long Walk to Freedom and her portray of Winnie took my breath away).I was very surprised to read today that Will didn't get a Golden Globe nomination for his portrayal of Howard and that the movie didn't get any nomination so far. Oh, well, awards can be really stupidGo watch this amazing film today!

For once, a ''top notch'' list of actors are well used and even if some are not in the films for a long time like Keira Knighley or Naomie Harris, their roles are as important as the rest.

98,iamianiman,The Most Manipulative Film in a Very Long Time,4,20 March 2018,"Although January has been known to be the dumping ground for films that studios don't believe in, December has also become that month as well. Yes, December and January is usually when you can go to any cinema and find a handful of films that will be nominated for #Oscars, ensuring your satisfaction at the movies. Having said that, smaller studio films are placed next to a huge blockbuster, because they don't know where else to place it. After seeing a few trailers for Collateral Beauty it truly made me think it was going to be a very enjoyable time at the theatre. Sadly, there is a reason that it was released alongside Rogue One: A Star Wars Story, not due to the fact that it wanted to compete for best quality, but because it really won't end up finding a huge fanbase. Why? Collateral Beauty is one of the most manipulative films I have seen in a long time. Let's dive in. Minor spoilers to follow. Read at your own risk. The plot of this film will be jarring to explain for those who don't know, because the trailers have technically been lying to you. Making it out to be a happy-go-lucky film about a man who has lost a child and is visited by embodiments of love, time, and death, Collateral Beauty masks its actual story, which really is about a man who is grieving the loss of his daughter, but also is about to lose his company, due to lack of focus. His employees gather together and hire actors to portray the embodiments of love, time, and death in order to stoop to his level after he writes letters to these ""things."" Not only is this a very mean-spirited film in my personal opinion, but it also takes away the magic of what the trailers advertise, even if that story would have been cheesier. If I had to choose between a mean-spirited or a sappy film, I would have choose sappy every day of the week. Although I have to admit that I disliked this film overall, the biggest compliment I can give Collateral Beauty, is the fact that it kept pulling me back in, due to the terrific performances. Everyone in this film seems to be giving it their all here, especially Will Smith. He is a man of very few words here, but his expressions and few scenes of complete mental and emotional breakdowns were truly heartbreaking. Helen Mirren, Keira Knightley, Michael Pena, Edward Norton, Kate Winslet, Naomi Harris, and Jacob Latimore all give commendable performances, and play off of each other in quite a believable way. Sadly, looking back on this film, these performances are what made this bore of a film watchable. Sure, the film is competently made, but there was so much room for expansion. The most frustrating aspect about Collateral Beauty was the amount of side stories with every character. The core story here is about Howard (Will Smith), but everyone else receives just as much screen time as him in order to develop their relationships outside of work. These people are supposed to be his friends, yet they do a very mean thing to him, and yet we are also supposed to care about their personal lives, while the story needs you to care about Howard the most. On top of that, just so that the film can have a big reveal in its final act, Howard's backstory is completely glossed over and given to the audience periodically throughout the film. This made the film extremely messy and I hardly found myself emotionally invested in any of it. In the end, Collateral Beauty it far too manipulative to fully enjoy and although I undoubtedly admired the fact that this is an original film, it was too messy to connect with me. I didn't like this film very much, but the performances are all terrific and while they do belong in a better film, that is the sole aspect that kept latching me on. I was able to grasp onto a few elements and Will Smith made me shed a tear for an instant, but only due to the fact that he committed himself to this role. The story itself is completely lacking depth and should have stuck with a more spiritual route in my opinion. It is competently directed by David Frankel, but sloppily constructed by writer Allan Loeb, who has actually made a couple films I have enjoyed in the past, such as 21. I found myself going back and forth between liking and disliking Collateral Beauty, but in the end, it is completely forgettable and I'll probably never find myself revisiting it. I can't get myself to recommend this film to anyone, but if you are a fan of any of these actors, you'll at least enjoy their performance.

I've kinda lost my interest in Will Smith in recent years, but in this movie he proves that he is still an incredible actor. The movie not only explores what happens to families and individuals after the loss of a child, but also how their reactions affect the people around them, asking the very valid question of whether your friendship with one, and your understanding of his ordeal, is enough to not only allow it to wreck your own life, but also the lives of all others counting on that person. The supporting cast, although not quite comparing to Will Smith, all offer strong performances (with the strange exception of Edward Norton who does seem kind of wooden here), and all play a pivotal role in sending the audience on an emotional journey, which really does talk to you, especially if you've had experience in losing one really close to you.

It then moves forward in time and Will Smith loses his daughter so therefore becomes a hermit with no personality. Now his business is in crisis because he does no work, so his ""FRIENDS"" who work for him hire a private investigator to break into the postal service and retrieve letters that he writes... Okay so his ""FRIENDS"" find out he's writing letters to Love, Death and Time, so they hire actors to play these three concepts. The actors confront Will Smith, in order to make him lose his temper in public. This was all filmed by the private investigator, who somehow digitally removes the actors, making Will Smith seem crazy, because it looks like he's yelling at no one. His ""FRIENDS"" now use this footage to get Will Smith kicked out of his business....... and then Will Smith thanks them....... Yep so this movie actually got made.

Stocks in their company are going down as Howard refuses to deal with his personal accounts and this is a last-ditch attempt to save their company by selling it at a loss by proving that Howard is mentally incapacitated.The actors they hire are Brigitte (Helen Mirren: The Queen, RED) as Death, Amy (Keira Knightley: Love Actually, Bend it like Beckham) as Love and Raffi (Jacob Latimore: The Maze Runner, Sleight) as Time and they interact with Howard, making him question everything including whether to attend a child bereavement support group run by Madeline (Naomie Harris: Skyfall, Moonlight).This is a beautiful movie which takes you through all the emotions associated with loss and grief. I had not expected much with the negative reviews, but this is a film that makes you question everything, just like you do when you lose someone you love. There are phenomenal performances throughout from all and yes this is not a blockbuster, or thrill ride, but this film packs a punch nonetheless. It will make you cry and there are some subtle twists made more significant by the excellent acting, spot-on emotional quotes and hilarious one liners, for example: ""I thought you couldn't afford therapy anymore."" ""I can't. It was my Uber driver."" ""Be sure to notice the collateral beauty. It is the profound connection to everything."" ""I am love. I am the fabric of life. I am the only 'why'... I was there in her laugh but I am also here now in your pain. Do not try to live without me.""Although not released in December, this film could easily become a classic Christmas movie of the future, for it takes place in the run up to Christmas and there are shades of 'It's a Wonderful Life' about it in that it teaches you life lessons on difficult subjects in a non-preaching way and it makes you cry....buckets.

118,danielnunez-81518,Worth the watch if you like interpersonal Dramas,6,22 April 2019,"I get the negative critic reviews, but I still think you should check it out if you're into Dramas.Tone - a little wishy washy, it's heartbreaking one minute, then there's some lighthearted crack the next.Performances - pretty good all around, especially Will Smith.Plot - this is where it kinda dips in quality. Felt a bit unfocused, there were subplots that maybe didn't need to be here due to the fact that they weren't all that fleshed out. Also, the ending could be a bit confusing to some (with the actors on the bridge, and then poof! You'll know what I mean if you've seen it). The little twist at the end though With Will Smith (before the final sequence) was really good and I actually wasn't expecting it.Story - Very heartwarming and relatable.Overall - Don't over analyze it and enjoy it if you like Dramas. If you're not into this kind of thing you should probably avoid it.",Collateral Beauty

The actors were given a script, they acted. Right emotional music played at the right time. A good amount of suspense was kept and a bit of twist was given at the end.It's like when someone new to cooking tries to cook food just according to the recepie and still the food tastes awful. I had the exact same feeling throughout the movie.If only the writers were a bit more deep, it would had fixed everything and instead of spending bucketload of money on getting the best two actors, it would had been much better if they had just got the whole crew to be average paid actors. Only two good actors mixex with so much bad acting just makes the whole movie terrible.I can write more in details but this movie was really good. Don't watch the movie because of the cast.

124,Yelitza-screenwriting-student,A creative tapestry of human complexities: philosophical and flourishing!,9,16 January 2017,"Interesting Drama with a touch of fantasy, emotional, and inspiring. Loved this movie! I have seen it twice.what's about? When an executive loses his 6 year old daughter he also loses his faith in life. He declares himself a stranger from his wife (and divorces) and he jeopardizes his company. Howard (Will Smith), is in state of shock. As such, he writes three letters to the Cosmos: to death, time, and love. In an attempt to save the company, his three advisors, Claire (K. Winslet), Whit (E. Norton), and Simon (M. Pena), agree on a plan: simulate Howard's handicapped mental by hiring a private detective, and three actors to play the roles of time, love, and death. By forcing Howard to confront these three abstractions he comes to the realization that he is in a troubled mental state and should approve the sale of the company to save the jobs of his employees. In the theatrical montage process, these ""actors"" (pay attention here, for they are not really ""actors""!) not only save Howard but also save/help Whit, Claire and Simon from their life's tragedies/dilemmas. Notice the words Sparks, Angels, and the beautiful lighting effects!!the wonderful: I loved the mystery, the suspense, the subtlety in every sentence spoken by these so called actors that each represented death, love, and time. What a fantastic and inspired performance! Knightley as Love, Mirren as Death, and Latimore as Time. Wow, such strength and feeling. I loved the pairing of the ""actors"" with the characters of Claire, Simon and Whit. I thought the message of each one was perfectly crafted and straight to the heart. I think these ""actors"" are angels! What do you think? You might arrive at that realization with the various clues along the story and in the final scene! Just wonderful. I also loved how Will Smith poured his heart and all his humanity in this role. Overall, the cast was fully connected and beautifully synchronized. I thought N. Harris empathetic, heart-reaching vibes were so real! In summation, a beautiful tapestry of human complexities. The Director, David Frankel (D. Wears Prada, Marley), has created a deeply human story with hidden touches of the supernatural! One thing that I found striking was how Death reveals its ""triumph"" to Simon, how Love discovers Whit's troubles, and how Time forecasts life to Claire.The to-think-about-it: Yes this film revolves about a sad, tragic event, but I couldn't let myself cry because the message of collateral beauty was so profound that it overpowered and neutralized pain and tragedy. The message of Time, Love and Death were so transcendental and life-giving! What a paradox! I loved it. I don't consider this film a sad, on the contrary. It is a like a tree which is rooted in tragedy, it's trunk is transformation; and its branches, leaves and blossoms, each are giving us a myriad of clues on how to live our lives to the fullest. Film-take-aways: Collateral beauty It's like noticing and admiring some stray pearls from a broken necklace in the middle of rubble...Of course seeing the collateral beauty in the middle of our tragedies and life's disasters/crisis is hard, but with time it makes itself visible when we allow it to.conclusion: Enjoy this heartwarming, illuminating, beautifully written-and-acted film and take home that collateral-beauty principle and keep it in your life's toolkit forever.Cheers.",Collateral Beauty

128,Searsino,Collateral Beauty... MEH,5,22 January 2017,"Let me preface my 5-star rating by saying that the movie was without a doubt entertaining. It's hard not to be with such a star-studded cast and strong supporting soundtrack to help bring out emotion.I had high hopes for this one. While I must admit to being suckered into such beliefs by the trailers, Will Smith and Edward Norton are two of the greatest Actors of our generation. Sure, they will land some flops (that's just statistics), but I have not been let down by the two in a while.Ultimately this one felt rushed. The back stories for all the supporting cast members (Michael Peña, for example, is dealing with a terminal illness from the get go) was just as depressing as that of Norton and Smith's characters. What this has done is take away from the focus of the leads! With such a glaring error in the way this story was produced, it's difficult not to feel there were less ingenious intentions involved.Too much packed into the script. While the premise was encouraging, it was evident within the first 20 minutes that there would be too much going on here. Everything felt rushed (not enough time invested in character stories).But of all the reasons I suspect this has flopped ($36 mil budget and $29,846,313 mil on opening weekend) the biggest flag for me was this reiteration of ""Collateral Beauty"" being spoken several times throughout... literally! There were several instances of characters mentioning the title of the film (word for word) or regularly revisiting a more typical situation so as to ensure every single person hasn't missed it. Production and Directors: Please stop treating the audience in a way that says we are incapable of detecting the more subtle aspects of a story.Ultimately I give this one five stars because of how great the actors/actress ensemble is. Had production advertised this one in much the same way that we saw in ""New Year's Eve (2011)"" or ""Valentine's Day (2010)"" (whom also packed the cast full of stars) my review would likely be far better. At least I would have known the mediocrity that was to come.I am a huge fan of Will Smith. It cannot be denied that most of what he will touch ultimately end up turning to gold (with the very rare flop such as "" After Earth (2013)""). Himself and Norton should be steering well clear of these kinds of motion pictures.I will conclude with a phrase everyone has likely been told at least once by a parent: ""I'm not upset, just disappointed.""----- 5/10 STARS -------- Review by Searsino -----",Collateral Beauty
129,twillis600-152-449978,"Good story, better acting & great climax.",10,24 December 2016,"Me and my girls(wife & daughter) went to see Collateral Beauty....I rate it a 10! It's a Sensitive topic because I'm the father of a daughter. But since she was there with us, I was able to push thru the story line.Any man that is a father of a daughter will need to secretly keep some tissues in his jacket pocket. Many men (including me) don't truly know love, until the moment they first hold their daughters. At that moment, there's an inexplicable phenomenon that happens and the steel that shields a mans heart, that makes it incapable for him to cry or show emotion, evaporates. At that moment, all other priorities become irrelevant and the focus of the fathers remaining existence, becomes protecting his baby girl. My entire existence is to ensure she is forever protected...to the best of my ability.Will Smith captures the essence of every father that shares my relationship with my daughter and how I would prefer to take on any pain, sadness or issues that would come her way. If you can understand that level of LOVE...then you will certainly enjoy this movie. Good story, better acting & great climax.",Collateral Beauty

So the partners idea is to hire 3 actors to play a physical manifestation of each one, get them to talk to him to the point he breaks down while they have a PI film it and digitally remove the actors so Will seems insane and they can use it to remove his voting rights at the company...Seriously this is the main plot.The movie wants to touch on the subject of loss and finding meaning after that, but the plot is so bad and it keeps getting worse.The twist is the actors are really Death Time and Love which makes the movie even more ludicrous once you start asking questions like well once the went to digitally remove the actors they weren't surprised to see none there? the company that did the job wasn't like, hmm you know there is nothing to remove right?The twist also can be seen from a mile away, it is hinted at the first meeting of the 3 ""actors""This movie reminded me of Ghosts of Christmas past and to me that was the proper way to do it.Have all spirits visiting him by themselves without the stupid plot, alone and in their own time and for the partners plot have Love visit Edward Norton , Time visit Kate Winslet and Death visit Michael Peña each giving them what they need and without any partner seeing any of the other spirits.Also there is another kinda silly plot going on were Will goes to therapy and the therapist is actually his wife, i mean i don't even know what to make of that.Overall a boring movie mainly due to its plot.",Collateral Beauty

And how good of Will Smith to appear leading a superb cast in this sad, life-affirming film. Smith leads a phenomenal cast in a story of a man who is completely lost following the death of his young daughter. Will Smith has been in so many commercial successes that he's more than earned the right to do something like COLLATERAL BEAUTY. And look at the cast that was drawn to the film--Edward Norton, Kate Winslet, Kiera Knightly, the astonishing Helen Mirren, Michael Pena, Naomie Harris, Jacob Lattimore are all wonderful. The film is confidently under the guidance of director David Frankel (Band of Brothers, The Devil Wears Prada). Allen Loeb's script avoids the pitfall of bathos with wit and a deep humanity.

138,mmgreenberg,Pure magic,10,7 October 2017,"This film is pure magic without any use of cgi effects or cartoon simulation. It comes from that source of magic which is our need to believe in something. Maybe all religions came about when we had to face the deaths of our loved ones. Maybe the consolation we need, and which they strive to provide, is what makes for that harmonious whole of congregation, text and spiritual leader. In the Jewish faith there is the recitation of the Kaddish which sternly redirects our grief to praise of that which created this universe. This film does not come short of that, but takes a meandering (yet tightly-plotted) course of discovery unique to a man who has been broken like Job, whose faith in every last thing has been denuded as false. Leonard Cohen recently said not one of us is not being tested, not one of us is immune to suffering and loss. He was rephrasing what it says time and again in the Bible and elsewhere, wherever we look for comfort.It is amazing Hollywood assembled such a stellar cast not as a box-office draw but to exploit each actor to the best of his abilities. Helen Mirren shines, Kate Winslet, Ed Norton, Michael Pena draw every laugh and tear out of you, while Will Smith's performance is exalting.There is much to quietly reflect on in this movie, hours, days, weeks, months, years later....It occurs to me that, if you have not been deeply affected by the death of someone, this movie will be utterly lost on you.

The story is not flawless and there are some predictable moments but at the same time, the journey is worth taking. The biggest challenge for the movie is the number of characters that it has at its core. There are seven characters with significant roles (an argument could be made for eight). Three characters act primarily as catalysts for the action. But still, that's a lot of characters to develop in a short period of time. As a result, the challenges that three of the characters are dealing with are spilled out onto the audience. All the actors are believable in their roles- --I just wish there was more time to develop their individual characters.I believe 20 more minutes of running screen time would have done wonders for this film. In spite of its shortcomings, I believe that it provides an emotional experience at the end of the film and also some poignant thoughts to ponder. Not perfect, but definitely worth seeing.

""Hidden Figures"" was still inspiring audiences and the one-two punch of Denzel and Viola made ""Fences"" another must see flick for the holidays. So when it finally hit video a few months ago, I almost forgot that I had missed it at the theaters. With such an all-star cast (Will Smith, Helen Mirren, Kate Winslet, Keira Knightley, Michael Pena, and Ed Norton) I was expecting a much stronger movie. The story is a solid one, it just didn't get the chance to fully evolve. Will Smith is the ultimate reason to see it. His heart-wrenching performance is the only thing that really grounds the film. The supporting cast (as talented as they are) never got the chance to fully explore their characters. It wasn't a bad movie, it just could have been so much more.

I did a little bit of research after watching it and saw that it got slammed by critics and I don't think it's all necessarily deserved. However, there were a lot of things in this movie that didn't make sense. It's hard to describe without going into spoilers but it's almost like this movie wants to have a sprinkle of fantasy, but it just doesn't really fit in with the theme of this movie. It also had a pretty dull start that took a little bit to get over. Plus, there was so much crammed into this movie that never really got a chance to be fleshed out, because if it did, the movie would've been much longer than it is now, specifically with the side characters and their personal lives. I think the movie would've been better if it just avoided those altogether, or at least not made them as major of a plot point. All this said, there were some really good moments. The actors were fantastic. Michael Peña really blew me away for the first time. Will Smith was excellent in this. There were some really heartfelt and emotional moments, interesting ideas, and some really good messages. I saw the star-studded cast was nominated for a Razzie for 'Worst Screen Combo.' I disagree. I thought there were some really memorable characters in this and everyone had really good chemistry. My final thoughts: there's so much about this movie that could've been much better but this was by no means an awful film.

151,imdbbonfiresky,What a Terrible Mess of a Film. Why was this made? Holiday cash grab?,1,17 December 2016,"I got dragged to this film due to star power. Never having seen a preview for this film. This is a made for the Hallmark channel film, daytime slot time waster. I guess the star power needed a holiday paycheck and a reason to hang out. None of the supporting character stories are developed/deep enough for you to care. The plot requires a major sense of disbelief.Spoilers Will Smith gives intro speech then doesn't say a word for half the movie. Next scene(2min later) 3 years later he looses a 6year old daughter we are never introduced to. Toward finale, ends up saying a few lines crying, and collecting a paycheck. All while director pans camera and plays music to build up suspense into boring plot. Followed by scenes of confused face Will smith cycling around New York City. He writes letters to Death, Love, Time or whatever. While his friends plot to screw him out of the company by proving hes unfit to run his own company. They do this by hiring 3 actors . Helen Mirren , Keira Knightly and some black dude I've never seen before. They hire some grandma looking lady that does this by stealing letters from a USPs mailbox, then uses a shitty cell phone with poor angles to capture this and they ""digitally remove"" the actors to prove hes talking to himself. (it gets worse)Actors confront Will Smith as Death/Love/Time he has an almost instant dramatic transformation,starts talking and snaps out of his depression (half the movie angry sad face). Goes to the support group for people with lost kids, where we are shown some dramatic monologues from mothers who lost kids. Hes been stalking the group outside many times. Organizer of group sees him. He comes in eventually. They kind have dates I guess. Support group lady drops a foreshadowing bomb you can see a mile away on when she lost her daughter. She recollects how at hospital, some old lady told her ""Collateral Beauty"" ( Hmm which old lady are we presented out of all the actors..Helen Mirren)In the end The ""actors"" turn out to be really who they are, death/love/time whatever. But not before screwing out Will Smith company friends of $20,000 each. (Makes sense right). And there is some emotional attempts of manipulation. Happy company partner friend guy apparently has cancer then confronted goes from happy to I'm dying in like 10min, emotional scenes with Helen Mirren.(your beyond caring at this point as you just want the movie to get to some point)But wait here comes the major emotional end scene..surprise Helen Mirren was the lady that told her that, and shes is really Will Smith wife, and he just had to be told that to remember.Really the actors tried here(- Will Smith) The Biggest fault lies With Director: David Frankel Writer: Allan Loeb. I don't know how or why they got the green light or the star power for such garbage.Wait to watch this film when you dumb down over the years due to memory loss and loose critical thinking abilities and they force you to watch this at your nursing home.I still can't believe they got all this star power to be in this turd.I would give this a 2.5/10 for some performances but the overwhelming studio plant astroturf reviews need some balance.",Collateral Beauty

That's this film.Despite Will Smith being the most prominent person on the poster, the film does not revolve around him. It's a story describing how everything connects along with, of course, collateral beauty.In this emotional film by Frankel, you are sure to find one character or another that you can relate to as an audience member. Perhaps this is why it is so riveting and engaging. Plus this film keeps you guessing about Helen Mirren's, Kiera Knightly's, and Jacob Latimore's characters of Death, Love, and Time respectively.Films that make you feel, think, and leave you with a new found experience and/or knowledge are my favorites and therefore this is my new favorite film. To me, it is the best film of 2016. True, it doesn't have many special effects or flashy scenery nor amazing camera work, but the script and acting makes up for all of it. It's a feel good, tear jerker, amazing film and if you had to see any film in theaters right now, I would strongly recommend this one to start off the new year.",Collateral Beauty
156,archyros-30909,An Amazing Film,10,1 October 2017,"The story is deep. The acting is amazing. There are so many great moments. And if I watch it again, I may cry. Will Smith shows what it is like to lose a child, and how his life has ground to a halt. He lives every day, but he cannot move forward. Until his friends decide to try to prove that he is too upset with life to be allowed to continue to run his ad agency into the ground. Their brilliant idea is to hire three actors to portray Love, Time and Death, because he has been writing letters to those cosmic concepts as if they are persons. Their intention is to capture video of him arguing with those entities to show that he is out of his mind. But he, along with his friends, gets help from those entities. Excellent writing, great scenes, I just finished watching it, and I have to go now. All I can say is Goodbye!",Collateral Beauty
157,mydistracteduniverse,"Collateral Beauty - Critics be quiet, it's a wonderful movie!",9,31 December 2016,"It is no coincidence that Collateral Beauty is set around the Christmas time and hit the cinemas during the festive season. As beautiful as the story is, it would have a hard time working at any other time of year. We meet Howard at the height of his game. He is an advertising executive with a loyal group of friends and business partners around him. Together they just opened a new office in New York and life is good. Fast forward three years and the picture has changed. Howard has changed. Two years ago he lost his daughter and is unable to process the grief that consumes him. He is no longer able to cope with his surroundings. Instead of working he stopped talking to people and spends his days building elaborate domino structures.This, of course, threatens the wellbeing of the firm and it's staff and his friends are slowly running out of options. Whit, Claire and Simon worked hard to keep the ship afloat but big contracts depend on the connection that Howard had with the clients. Without his input the business has taken a turn for the worse. However, there is light at the end of the tunnel. They have an offer to sell the company but Howard won't hear any of it. In their desperation Whit suggests to hire a private detective to help gather evidence that Howard is unfit for business. At first hesitant, Claire and Simon eventually agree and the PI discovers that Howard wrote three letters: one each to Love, Time and Death.They decide to hire three actor to portray Love, Time and Death. The actors are at first supposed to interact with Howard to shake him out of his stupor. That failing they go on to the next steps in the plan.All the while Whit, Claire and Simon are directing Love, Time and Death they also struggle with their own personal problems and how to deal with them. Whit gets a lesson in love, that he desperately needs because his daughter hates him after his divorce. Claire has dedicated her life to the company and made the staff her priority. Now feels she ran out of time to create her own family. And Simon is in dire need of advise from death himself.Meanwhile Howard spends his evenings watching a support group for bereaved parents through a window. One night he gathers up the courage to go inside and join. The group leader is a woman called Madeleine, who lost her daughter to a rare form of brain cancer. Although he is unable to speak about the loss of his own child, this together with the appearances of Love, Time and Death are the begin of the healing process he so desperately needs. With Collateral Beauty there will be no middle ground. It's like Marmite. There will be people who love it and there will be people who hate it. I love it. It is such a beautiful story. Will Smith is giving one of the best performances of his life. Considering that his character doesn't speak for most of the time all his emotions are portrayed by facial expressions and body posture. The man is a terrific actor!Helen Mirren is a brilliant as always. She can do no wrong in my mind. Her portrayal of Death could have been awkward, but in fact is was just the right balance between serious and light hearted. Kate Winslet is a wonderful actress. Unfortunately the role didn't do it for me. It didn't do her acting ability justice. It's almost as if the actress was bigger than the role. Although, on the occasions when her talent could be shown - show it she did.I was disappointed with Keira Knightley's performance. Not quite sure if she was meaning to play a bitch, but she certainly came across that way. Not very nice for someone supposed to portray Love. Naomie Harries plays Madeleine, the woman that Howard meets at the support group. She gives a stellar performance in her portrayal of the heartbroken mother who lost her little girl in such a cruel way. I can certainly see, where the critics are coming from. There aren't any ups and downs and in a way, the story is also quite predictable. Yet, I really loved it. I can see myself pulling Collateral Beauty out every Christmas together with all the other Christmas movies such as Love Actually & Co. Collateral Beauty is a very moving film. It took me several days of mulling it over in my head before I was able to put my thoughts into words. In fact I actually went to see it when I first came out here in Ireland on December 26. But I felt that I wanted to keep it close to me for a while, before talking about it. That in itself makes it special to me, because I don't get this feeling very often.It also is a very sad movie but it also is full of hope. In so many ways. It gives hope that we have enough Time and Love before Death comes and gets us. And hope that we will be able to see the Collateral Beauty all around us in those we lost.",Collateral Beauty

159,stilloopless1,Beautiful Story,10,3 January 2017,"The trailers for this movie had me intrigued to say the least. Writing to Death, Time, and Love and getting an in person response?! And what is collateral beauty after all? Never heard of it. Collateral damage, yes, but collateral beauty..? Still can't say for sure, but, it packs a helluva punch.The premise has tear jerker written all over it, however, the setup for the movie was still surprising. Things aren't as clear cut, black and white as they first seem. The surprises, twists and turn, (especially the last one) are artfully done and take this movie to a higher level, leaving you with a lot to think about.Also surprising, much like life itself, especially during hard times are the moments of humor. Perfectly timed, executed, and organic.The all star cast is unbelievable. The incomparable Helen Mirren, flawless. Kate Winslet emotional and compassionate. Edward Norton human and flawed. Michael Pena quality all the way. Keira Knightly funny, sweet, pained and beautiful. Relative newcomer Jacob Latimore is fierce in his portrayal and he delivers quite the slap in the face wake up call. This kid is someone to keep an eye on.Finally, Will Smith... Damn. This is a tour de force performance that reminds me just what an amazing actor Smith has become. Quiet, subtle, pained, raw, emotional, vulnerable. The first fifteen to twenty minutes of the film, Smith doesn't even speak, but you see and feel every bit of the hurt and turmoil his character is going through. I'm not gonna lie, every time he was on screen I had to fight back tears just looking at his eyes. It's simply heartbreaking and devastating. Once he does began to speak/engage the power of his performance became undeniable.If you want to great writing/acting and a film that will make you think and feel this is the movie to see. Grab yourself a box of Puffs, you'll need them, and check out this 10 tissue beauty.",Collateral Beauty

In the beginning it seemed like Leo Dicaprio, a classification stamp assigned to him, regardless of the greatness of the actor. But as years and roles came...Edward, Michael and Kate, nice trio. Here, they are all with their own serious problems, although seemingly invisible to the person this movie is centered around - Howard (Will). After loss of his loved daughter. Soul too hurt to live, sorrow too big to heal. Business they all have in common is falling apart with Howard faraway. Hence they decide to stop it, either to reach him or to get rid of him. One way or another, they hire trio of actors to stage those Howard is addressing, when expressing the grief: The Death, the Time and the Love.As story goes, trio of actors and the trio of Howard's mates crosses.

162,marcos-73933,Like an After-School Special,3,13 January 2017,"Fantastic acting, especially Will Smith. Some compelling scenes.But it reminded me to much of the movies they used to show at Church. The whole point of this type of didactic movie is to share a message of some sort. The message is more important than the movie, and as a result the movie often suffers artistically. But strangely, I'm not even sure what the message of ""Collateral Beauty"" was.Like a Church movie or an after-school special, there was just too much in-your-face stuff. Constant super-close-ups of the actors' faces while they're having deep conversations, the lingering of the camera for up to five seconds beyond reasonable, to the point where you almost feel like a stalker, and symbolism that is shoved down your throat. Characters that we don't care about that much because they seem, well, too manufactured. Lines that contain some interesting thoughts but because they come out of nowhere have the same impact as a pithy saying on a fridge.I like the idea of collateral beauty. If we look hard enough there may even be some of it in this movie. But as it was I walked away with an unsettled feeling in my stomach, even though I skipped the popcorn.",Collateral Beauty

Also a well casted movie. I feel like I could watch the movie many times and get something different from it every time. Each entity brought such passion to the roles. As the main character is so angry at Death, Love and Time, the same entities show the same passion, and anger back at times. As we see Death, Love and Time interact with the different characters I am reminded of Dickens A Christmas Carol. It does not end quite the same as this movie has a different and some what confusing twist. Which brings me to my only fault...did Will Smith character forget his wife completely? Did I miss something explaining how he did forget her? A wonderful movie with great complex thoughts that bring such powerful feelings and hopefulness.

172,zimmerblitz,A thing of beauty,10,8 March 2020,"I don´t write too many reviews, and more often than not when I dislike something.
But after having seen Collateral Beauty and finding it rated with a meager 6,8 average I will do something I thought i´d hardly ever do, and give it a rating of 10 (in words :TEN).
Because in my opinion it is one of the rare occasions where a movie works so well that all the flaws that it contains can easily be forgiven.
If the three actors actually exist, or if they truly ARE love, time and death....
well- who knows.
I must say I was expecting to see Whit, Claire and Simon walk into the ""theater"" at the end, to find it empty and be told that it was like that for a long time.
A bit of a ""twilight-zone"" moment. But maybe this would have been too much- and it wasn´t really necessary to make the point.
So I will just say that when Will Smith said about the cast "" ""If we are all judged by the company we keep ... then I want this cast with me for life!"" he was saying something true and beautiful.
Helen Mirren´s performance alone would have been worth a rating of 9 , I have hardly ever seen a woman that fascinating, moving, funny, attractive and sexy.
Well done, funny to read about the director having been changed, and who was initially asked to do what part- but the outcome could simply not have been better.
So many American movies about live, love etc. are not worth watching a second - or even first- time- but this one I watched again as soon as it ended.
Because it is a thing of beauty.
Thanks for that.",Collateral Beauty
173,paul-3991,Better than I heard!,9,26 December 2016,"This movie had great character development, a great story line, and was as good as I thought it would be when I first saw one of the previews. Why it got poor reviews from others can only be attributed to the limitations of people not understanding nor appreciating a good story & movie. It seems that without a lot of special effects, people can't get into a movie anymore. A lot of violence, CGI and a very limited plot apparently spells success now-a-days.This movie is well worth seeing for yourself. I very highly recommend seeing it, especially if you can keep track of a good plot and don't need the simplicity of comic book story-lines in order to understand good writing.I am older than a lot of people here, which means that I grew up with movies with character development and well thought out plot lines. While I do enjoy movies with a large amount of CGI & special effects, without a decent plot they are empty of substance.Collateral Beauty well deserves the 9 stars I am giving it. We almost didn't go to see it based on the reviews we were reading about it. I am glad that in the end we ignored those reviews and went with our original opinion of how good we hoped & thought the movie would be. We may even go to see it again...it was that good.

If I was someone who actually experienced the death of my child, I would have been outraged while watching this idiocracy of a film. The contrived bits of ""insight"" were of less value than something that would come out of the mouth of a five year old. The title of the movie was thrown in with no purpose or sense to it. The twists and turns were apparent from a mile away.ALSO, PLEASE. FOR THE LOVE OF GOD. DOES ANYONE ELSE NOTICE THAT THE ENTIRE MOVIE IS A GIANT PLOTHOLE?If at the end of the whole thing, the actors playing death love and time are indeed abstract and invisible to most people, than what was the point of that entire plot to get Will fired? The private investigator didn't think these people were crazy too? What about the guy they hired to digitally remove them from the footage? (Which also wouldn't have even been possible from the angles the P.I. was shooting from) I'm sure he would've loved to reconstruct the entirety of Will Smith's body, except of course for the fact that there was nobody there in the first place. Imaging Kate saying ""oh yeah, riiiight there. That woman in the blue dress. Oh. There's ACTUALLY NOBODY THERE? INTERESTING!"" Such a cheap sell. All of this movie. Bad. Bad bad bad. I am so sad that people found some sort of message in this pile of dung. I could continue to go on about all the issues in this movie. But I will leave it at this.

Will Smith is great, no doubt. The other actors are very good too.-The last moments of the movie are good. They surprise you.Cons:-It is boring; it spends a lot of time on unnecessary scenes and dialogues that are either marginal or not related to the main story.-It is not deep. Drama is supposed to enter in depth in human emotions. The main issues in the movie ""death"", ""time"" and ""love"" are discussed very superficially, and the related dialogues are short. Even the main issue of the movie ""Collateral Beauty"" is very passive.Summary: Although the movie had had all the requirements of a good movie like good acting and good story line, I will not recommend a boring superficial drama.",Collateral Beauty

Now don't take it the wrong way, maybe if you have the same virus as me to predict movies and then feel a little disappointed, there is always possibilities you may find out the plot twists, before they happen, but until then I think you should give it a go.

Began with an interesting plot and with the kind of pain nobody would ever dismiss and then it just kind of falls flat around half way. It was just trying too hard. It tried putting in all these little tidbits to keep you thinking and giving all the other characters depth and emotions that came across as the robot writing thinking to themselves 'oh, other humans will probably find this sad let's put it in.' The only reason I cried during some of it was because Will Smith was crying and then it all went dry in the last half hour and I was resisting the urge to see how much was left.

These movies help is to take a step off the fast wheel and just take a moment to think. I think the movie demonstrates a certain feeling that we all become quite numb in our lives. Numb to other people's feelings, numb to our own needs and numb to our pain and to the needs of others. It doesn't surprise me that someone would write a dreadful review about this movie. I ask for what motive? Movies are not for everyone. There are many movies that I don't like but I don't feel compelled to scrutinise what was bad or wrong about it. I have grown up with Will Smith and I have always loved his movies. I think if you love Will Smith you'll just love this movie anyway. Love, Tine Death, three key things that connect us all. It's true. And this movie has the ability to relate to anyone who is perceptive of their circumstances, surroundings and open to possibilities and ideas. This movie is a wonderful journey, I never picked my phone up once, I was intrigued and absorbed with this compelling tale of grief. Yes it deals with grief yet it doesn't bring you down. A great cast! Simply perfection. The story is more than it seems and if you connect with it you will make some links and realisations and messages will reach out to you, mostly about the importance of trust and human kindness.

Initially I definitely expected a lot, thinking the trailer was really good and being that Will Smith is one of my favorite actors. However, I was completely open minded to having the movie play out differently than what I expected. I think the part I just really didn't like was how the movie was arranged. I'm not sure whether or not it was the way it was directed or the way it was written, but it seemed slow and boring to follow at first. Some scenes or story lines felt underwhelming, shallow, or just unnecessary (making it slow). On top of that, I wish they created more of a story, more background where we feel connected to the characters. As the story unfolds and you learn things, you might sort of feel connected based on where the characters are in their lives. So maybe based on your personal experiences you may feel different than I did, but yeah they didn't really reel me in. At some point the scenes, dialogue, transitions, or general direction of the movie definitely did feel all over the place and scattered. I wish there would have been more depth, in some cases. The lack thereof may be due to them creating this sort of, light-humored comedic balance. It just felt surface level, as if they were trying to trigger your emotions with surface level things.Interesting concept, the ending did amaze me, but sadly that was the best part for me.",Collateral Beauty

Every tragedy is accompanied by beauty.

Although there are some predictable moments that make this journey of 90 minutes, worth taking.Will Smith! The multitalented actor, have successfully made me fall in love with the character of Howard. It makes you cry, smile, sad, emotional & touchy at the end.Every actor has acted phenomenally.

195,mdreser44,Maybe too mysterious for most.,8,19 November 2021,"I saw a lot of critical critiques. My perspective is that it may be too deep for many to understand. It's a message about life's mysteries...here named, for simplicity, Love, Time and Death. It's about overcoming yourself, and struggling through sorrows, learning self-control learning to live with grace. It's about people helping each other.Loeb is so good at contrasting our realities with life's mysteries. The visible versus the invisible. Perhaps this movie only appeals to those with a sense of mysticism.",Collateral Beauty

197,jimmymahone,"Great characters, implausible premise.",7,1 January 2017,"I'm ready to see any film starring Will Smith and some of his co-stars. This was a nice drama, although its premise was a hard sell.For someone to be that grief-riven after two years as to totally disregard the welfare of everyone around him seemed like a stretch. Smith does a nice job, complemented by the tragic parallel story lines of his key co-workers. Still, it was hard to imagine such emotion after such a stretch of time, given the tremendous strength of the main character.Truly enjoyed the outstanding cast of perennial favorite actors and actresses. Worth seeing, with a satisfyingly ""surprise"" ending. Still, much more could have been done with such a wealth of acting talent.",Collateral Beauty

Only critique I have: I would've enjoy the movie a little bit better if the part with the company and the actors was a little less relevant. The movie had the potential to keep people crying the whole time. But, this said, it was awesome.
I read a lot of just, STUPID, critics. Critics should start being less arrogant and start understanding that we, viewers, don't give a damn about their deep personal tastes.
""Professional"" criticism should be based on general criteria, which can be consulted and judged by everyone, and not on strictly personal tastes or on the frustration of some unsatisfied wife because will smith has not shown the ABS. I'm not a critic, but I can spot little haters with a keyboard that call themselves ""critics"". And there's plenty of them. Imo, great movie. Sorry for who didn't enjoy it.",Collateral Beauty
199,eamon_yates,Ignore The Critics - Its Not What You Think,10,22 January 2018,"Some of you may have seen the understated adverts for Collateral Beauty during its release in 2016. I remember seeing them and thinking, its just another of those feel good comedy films thats not really that special, why should I watch this one? Consequently, I didn't watch the film until now.Having recently seen this appear on streaming services I thought, what have I got to lose except the 93 mins run time it has and, to be honest, I can even do something while watching if it is that bad.Well, how wrong I was! I am genuinely glad I watched this film and found myself hooked by the end. I strongly recommend it, especially if you liked films like Seven Pounds, also featuring Will Smith.Don't get me wrong the start of this film leaves you with a lot of questions and not a lot of answers. The key character, Howard Inlet played by Will Smith, is so aloof I even found myself questioning if he was indeed the lead character. Surrounded by a bumper crop of great actors and actresses such as Helen Mirren, Edward Norton, Keira Knightley, Kate Winslet, Naomie Harris, Michael Pena and Jacob Latimore, you worry that this is a film that will either deliver in spades or not at all and unfortunately the start makes you feel the latter is about to happen.However, if you stick with this film until around two thirds through you will start to realise that everything that has happened is a mixture of great storytelling and script writing by Allan Loeb and fantastic acting choices, notably by Naomie Harris, Kate Winslet and Will Smith who I personally think delivers one of his finest acting performances ever. Knowing that this story was incredibly close to Will Smith due to the passing of his father and realising how much risk he took on in doing this role at such an emotionally vulnerable time simply heightens the respect I have for an already huge role model for me. What this also brings to the film is a level of depth in his character that at times I am sure is nothing short of actually real.One of the great things that stood this film apart for me by the end was the sheer level of depth that the characters had. Discovering this depth was a charm rather than being instantly revealed. It was discovered in small drips and drabs which created a completely believable reality that the actors really brought you into with their performances of these unique individuals. So refreshing not to be spoon fed the characters histories in the first 5 minutes in a poor attempt to make them appear deep.By the end of the film I was hooked and bordering on being an emotional wreck. Yes, real men cry too. There were genuine points where I had no idea what characters were going to do and I was riveted to the screen without a thought of doing anything else. Theodore Shapiro creates a unique and hugely haunting soundtrack that complements the tough, gritty moments on screen and simply heightens the emotional connection with the film. Even as a stand-alone album, the soundtrack is great to listen to.So, should you watch this film? If you do, stick with it to the end. There will be those that simply don't enjoy this genre and type of film, simply check rotten tomatoes to prove this and I have no problem with people feeling that way, I won't force you to watch something that doesn't appeal. Although I will say, this film is not your average, its clever, deep and carries some great emotional layers and storytelling that I think if you are prepared to go with it, you will be pleasantly surprised.I look forward to watching this again and it is definitely firmly found its place in my Bluray cabinet. Please don't let the scores on review sites and the adverts put you off.Pleasant watching!",Collateral Beauty

Death.Three of the most, if not thee most Important principals of life. Love is purpose, Time is the gift & death is the end. In this film each three of these is manifested & played out to a grieving Dad (Will Smith), who lost his daughter from an early age. There is also a nice symmetry between other characters, showing these three things affect others in much different ways.With out giving to much away, all I can now do is urge people to give this a watch, but don't just watch it, feel it & understand it. It's certainly given me food for thought.",Collateral Beauty
202,carlowdelete,Pretty good movie if...,8,18 December 2016,"you're not one of those that expect a movie to change your life.The acting in this movie was spot on. Will Smith hit it out the park as a father who had an extremely difficult time dealing with the death of his child. The ending was totally unexpected and great! There were only 1 or 2 moments that I felt were typical of scenes in movies but forgivable given the movie in it's entirety. The plot was unique, the acting was pretty good by the other characters. As a father I could feel what was going on in Will's heat and soul. Edward Norton's problems are experienced by many fathers who are on the loosing end of a custody battle with the mom bad mouthing the daughter concerning adult issues.Every reviewer that's digging really depend into the movie to dissect it really need to learn to sit back and watch a movie and enjoy it.

It's so disappointing when A good film falls victim to one in, all in.Such a beautiful film and the concepts are interesting. It's not a movie that has been over done and it's ideas are new and interesting which is why the reviews baffle me. 
It does have moments of pulling at the heart strings but what's so wrong with that? It brings out our emotions and really gets you questioning, how would I feel if I lost someone? How would I cope? Who would I blame? Imagine if we could speak to death, love..ect. What would you say to them?It's a though provoking film and the ending is beautiful and well thought out. It's a little surprise but one that brings it all together Another near flawless preformance by Will Smith and the supporting actors all bring their own quirk to the screenSo glad I picked this up, definitely a movie to remember.

He knows how to choose the really good works between the rest and knows how to handle them in order to create something at least worth watching.To be honest, he is one of the very few actors, (Edwart Norton is also one of them) that when I see he is participating in a film I know is gonna be good.What I really enjoyed in this movie, is how everything changes in the end.

206,fvlecmatic,Movie is quite original but could've been better,7,15 December 2016,First of all I have to say that I was really looking forward to see this movie and I had big expectations from it. That's always a bit tricky as mostly you end up disappointed. And that's almost what happened. This movie started in my opinion a bit silly and my first impression was that this will be a disaster. But it did build up nicely and although it is not the best movie I've seen this year it didn't disappointed me in the end.The story is beyond any doubt original. I loved the fact that beside the main story there are tree side stories which all have their meaning and depth. Everything fits nicely together (maybe even too much) and the final result is a sad but entertaining drama which will likely hit you on a greater emotional level. There's also a surprise twist which I just didn't see coming.The only downfall are the last two ridiculous scenes which made the movie rather about magic than real issue solving. They were just overblown and shouldn't be in the movie. But again this movie is worth your time. But don't get too excited.,Collateral Beauty

It is very formulaic, but the acting is good. Even the little parts are good. I would say if you watched and liked ""The Fault in Our Stars"" this is a good movie for you. It focuses on interpersonal relationships and the raw emotions that come with tragedy. If you are looking to cry, but definitely feel something, this is the movie for you.I feel like a lot of the negative hype may come from expecting more from the movie than was ever promised. Two of the main actors are known as taking action movie roles. This movie was never marketed as an action movie, though. It was advertised as a drama about a man who had lost his child. That is exactly what it is. Sure there are some unexpected turns, but at the end of the day, don't expect what was never advertised to be there.",Collateral Beauty

210,cadburypg,I do not understand the utter bad reviews for this movie,7,14 August 2017,"This movie is about a parent (Will Smith) coping with the grief of losing a 6 yr old child. This was in no way as bad as the critics cried out to be. Howard (will smith) used to be an advertising genius and entrepreneur before he became devastated with the loss of his daughter. Being the majority shareholder of his firm he became a ship which was pulling everyone to the bottom as it sank. So when his partners were unable to bring him back over a period of 2yrs they ""gaslight"" him. Howard in his own grief was completely detached with the world outside. His partners and employees were at the brink of joblessness and financial ruin. Whit (Edward Norton), Claire (Kate Winslet) and Simon (Michael Peña) are his long time partners and friends. They employ a PI to monitor his actions so that they could render him mentally unsound and thus incapable of using his majority shareholder voting rights in the decision to sell the business to another firm. In the meantime Whit whose mother is slightly mentally unsound has an idea to employ actors impersonating Love time and death , the 3 abstracts that Howard is obsessed with. HOWARD had written poignant letters to all 3 abstracts which the PI had acquired.it was an attempt to step into Howards reality and help him recuperate or else use the evidence against him. The letters written by Howard were soul wrenching. This was a father whose career and marriage fell apart because he didn't know how to deal with his grief. The story shows different ways to cope like going to group therapy sessions. It also shows that there is a difference between how each parent of the same child copes and perceives the situation. There are sub plots revolving Whit,Claire and Simon too who think they have chosen actors but actually the 3 abstracts chose them one each to show what they were each missing out.Helen Mirren as Death couldn't be more firm in her consolations or more sassy in her attitude reflecting the inevitability and finality that she represents. Its also ironical that death which should be the end of all pains is a woman as opposed to all cultures showing Death as a formidable man. Keira Knightley as Love was the cutest and smartest form Love could come in. She looks fuller,says clever and funny lines and yet reflects compassion and pain in her eyes just as love should be. Jacob Latimore as time is curt and impatient. He is smart and speaks in mysterious ways contradicting himself at times, rebukes and mocks Howard and Claire on how we waste its gifts. I liked the movie. It touched my heart although the plot could have been smarter. May be more depth and credibility could have been lent to the sub plots. Kate winslet was good but was wasted in a somewhat soppy character. I resented that. Edward Norton as Whit who was recently divorced due to his philandering, stayed with his sick mom and at the brink of financial ruin was aptly portrayed. He is the suave Newyorker who takes advices from uber driver (Try to step in their reality rather than force our own on them.Would love to take therapy from such an uber driver).Micheal Peña as Simon who way dying due to cancer, was mostly coughing through the movie which was slightly cliché. These are some holes i found but not worth panning the movie altogether.",Collateral Beauty

216,lelya_fantastka,"""If Love is creation and Death is Destruction, I am just a terrain in between""",10,25 August 2021,"It seems to me, it is one of the most heartwarming stories about grief and recovery from it that I have ever watched at the cinema. The movie is simple, the stories of all characters are ordinary, there is no remarkable in it, but it forsakes the pleasant aftertaste, as if .......
The movie is made very sophisticated, it twists the fates of eight persons. I enjoy movies where you cannot divide the characters into bad and good, where you are observing the deportment, behaviors of the heroes, analyzing them, imagining yourself in his place and asking yourself a question how I would act in a particular situation like a main hero or like some other one? Because of these reasons this movie is ideal fit to my vision of the best cinema.There are four life stories in front of us, first one is a story of Howard who has lost his beloved child from the incurable disease, the second character is his best friend Whit which is recovering from the emotionally difficult divorce and trying to improve the relations with his daughter which rejects to communicate with them. Besides them we can take a look at the life of two other characters - Howard's friends Simon and Claire. Simon like most Americans is a self-made man, and he is terminally ill (incurably sick), and if he has already accepted to the end of his life, his family doesn't know anything about his disease. Claire has been dedicating all her life to their marketing agency and she refused from her own family to this great business project. All of the characters have their personal issues and at the same time they have one common concern about the future of their company which they gave a half of their lives and which is destroying before their eyes while their major shareholder is coming to himself after his daughter's death.All heroes are surviving the loss in one form or another. Howard literally lost his daughter, she is dead, Whit has lost his daughter after the divorce, and despite she is alive, she feels hate to him and accuses him in the painful divorce, Simon is just going to lose his family due to the decease, this process is close and inevitable, and Claire has almost missed her chance to happy home and family because she has been giving all her time and cares to the company for the last 15 years till the time, she understood she wanted a child. All heroes are need a specific therapy and they meet with it in a face of actors trying to search money for a new play.All actors are up to their tasks and from my point of view there is no main character in the movie. At first sight, you can think that Howard is the main character, but I don't know why his storyline wasn't so captivating for me as the story of Whit. The idea of third Howard's friends is very unusual and fantastic, firstly I thought it wouldn't work due to the Howard's detachment but further I surprisingly found out that it has been worked, and Howard gave a new response to Love, Death and Time.I recommend this movie to people who can estimate profound and thoughtful movie and prefer steady plot, who can enjoy the beauty of the picture on the screen, who has a possibility for long thoughts, who likes to search of the hidden meaning and indulge in reflections. You are getting the true pleasure.",Collateral Beauty

All I know is, it is certainly very good from my viewpoint. It isn't even the storytelling, which is interesting, what with 4 arches throughout the film. Admittedly, some of the arches almost outshone the main one in some parts. The performance from the star-studded cast is (mostly) brilliant.

I pay attention to people while leaving the theater and no one had a look on their face that this movie was horrible. All of the actors in this film were perfect.

That is because I had heard we were given a trailer that fed us something not even remotely close to what the film represents. Please do not read below this if you do not want SPOILERS.SPOILERS:First of all, yes, the actors (Love, time and death) were hired by Norton, Winslet and Pena to stalk Will Smith's character ""Howard"". Or at least they think they were the ones initiating the deal.One by one the ""actors"" would convince Howard somehow that he was either crazy, or as an audience, we are hoping he snaps out of his emotional downward spiral due to the death of his daughter. After seeing the movie and being able to legitimately dissect it, we know that Knightly was sent as LOVE to catch Norton's eye. She purposely wears a red knit cap noticed by Norton as he chases her down and follows her to the theatre. Love reels in the first catch and the other two followed.As TIME collects his check from Winslet at the end, he proceeds to tell her that the play is no longer going to happen. Coincidence? Not really, since they never intended to have one.Then we later find out that Mirren was DEATH in the waiting room at the hospital with Howard's wife. This automatically tells us that these three entities who were hired as actors are really the spirits we've been told they were as shown in the trailers. At the very end, Howard turns around and sees the three on the bridge, but they disappear when his wife turns around.I am very satisfied with the entire film. If you did not realize at the end that the three are spirits, you did not catch the clues and maybe this just isn't the film for you.",Collateral Beauty

Of course this more sensitive category of movie lays itself open for cynicism and I would not go to see this with a bunch of mates, but with this type of movie I try to sit back and let it gently flow. And it flowed nicely for my wife and I. And we were rewarded with what we thought was an excellent, satisfying ending. If Need For Speed is your favorite franchise this is not for you.

Death is destruction, the end, the moment when it all ends. Love is the beginning, the blossom, the desire, the pain, the suffering, in short, Life! Time is all that begins with Love and ends with Death. The film Beauty Collateral, leaves us in reflection on these three remarkable entities on the human life. And we come across them as they mark us throughout Life. It is undoubtedly an excellent masterpiece that I could not have seen for along time in the movies. Even if we write letters to make us feel more humans, we will always have to shout out loud what we feel to free ourselves from the shock, the illusion, the pain, the suffering that the loss of someone makes us feel at that moment. To lose a child, to lose a father, to lose a friendship, to lose her love for not loving her, everything have the precis time to heal, to mourn his loss (Death) and to always feel the Life (Love) in all Moments.

It is so familiar to keep an eye on the collateral damage of anything we do. We don't tend to look for beauty. This movie is so deep, and it is one of those type of movies that make you think! It illustrates the three big why's that drives us; love, death, and time. These three constructs are not absolute; they are not fixed and they don't diminish. They are so sensitive to things, events, and people surrounding us. They change forms, and accordingly change our lives.

252,bogdandzakovic,"Where is the ""Collateral Beauty""?",7,11 January 2018,"Apparently, this film has been slaughtered by the critics. While I have long learned not to pay any attention to the professional reviews, I must admit this one comes as a bit of a surprise. Not an earth-shattering experience by any means, but a truly good movie none the less. It captivates attention from the off - not with action or chase sequences, but with an idea; not with special FX, but some truly masterful performances from the cast.This movie will keep your attention throughout, and unless your name is Hercule Poirot, you're probably in for a massive surprise at the very end - the kind of surprise that will ensure this movie, and its message, endure in your memory beyond the time it takes you to walk back to your car from the theatre. You will find yourself speechless for a while when its done, left to ponder the ramifications on what you have discovered, retracing every step of the story with this new insight - and it will make you appreciate how good the acting (and the writing!) was even more.Back to the title - Collateral beauty - where is it, exactly? If I'm not mistaken, the underlying message of the movie is the following: In every tragedy, there is hidden, unintended beauty, that comes as a direct consequence of said tragedy. Unless I have completely misinterpreted the central premise of the movie, I do not think it delivers what it purports to do. More to the point - what is the collateral beauty in the death of his daughter?Nevertheless, for some strange reason, while an omission such as this one would have normally left me annoyed to the point of completely ruining the experience , it doesn't seem to bother me one tiny bit.

A performance put alongside Seven Pounds and the Pursuit of Happiness proudly. It was also great to see Edward Norton come back in this movie. It's the perfect soft comeback needed.

The plot itself is so original, the screenplay is absolutely captivating and the performance shown and given by each actor (especially Helen Mirren which I adore- to me, her acting is beyond natural, she is the character, she no longer acts like the best actress, she's beyond that, she's the god of all actors). I watched the movie with my mom sitting next to me, and I looked at her whilst watching the movie and I saw a coat of tears in her eye, a second away from dropping down her face. I felt as if her tear is held hostage in her eye. Withholding itself, just from my mom's fear of god forbid loosing any of us, her children. I cried (to be accurate- wept whilst kissing my mom on the cheek afraid of loosing her), I felt joy, anger, fear, wanting to scream with the empathy I felt towards each character, I was in an emotional storm like a nine month's pregnant woman.

But about a third of the way in it becomes quite wonderful, though it helps if you love death. Will Smith could be better, though he tries, has his charm and comes through in the end, but Keira Knightley delivers several fabulous riffs, one as love, Helen Mirren is self illumined as death and Kate Winslet, Edward Norton and Naomie Harris shine in their supporting roles. Allen Loeb's script is spotty but ends up being superbly written though in a subtle way that many might under appreciate. And Maryse Alberti beautifies New York and captures other luscious sets and facial expressions as few DPs have, no doubt with the help of Frankel's sometimes excellent direction. The music is great and, ultimately, the film is quite love-filled and fulfilling if you have the temperament and patience.",Collateral Beauty

Sadly it was wasted on me, and my wife. The whole concept of three actors playing love, death and time was just pointless and seemed to be of little relevance in the end anyway.

I am of the former, over the moon. I watched it on a plane and found myself in tears by the end, but because I felt hope, absolute unadulterated hope. It's not about death, though some have said as much. It's not about money or acting or any of that. It's about life and the reason to go on, irrespective of what tragedy we face or what difficulty we're going through. It's about finding purpose in a seemingly purposeless world. I think some people see the all-star cast and expect something more that a character driven idea, but the best films connect with their viewers and nothing more. This film jarred me out of myself and made me think that faith in the universe is not such a bad idea.

Unfortunately the movie itself doesn't isn't able to live up to it fully. Even though you get the feeling that the intention was to make it a kind of feel-good pre-Christmas movie à la ""the Holiday"" - there were just too many distracting logical weaknesses in it, such as the scene where Kate Winslet (who is completely under-challenged in her role) walking into a poor area in a designer dress handing over 20K cash and ANNOUNCING it loudly. Most actors aren't given room to develop their role, instead their character is smacked into the audience's face by their situation being talked about or repeatedly displayed (Winslet's wish for a child).

Instead you end up with something that only is weird and doesn't make any sentence. But i must say that both Will smith and Edward Norton does a okay job and tries, but their mediocre performances can't save this move.

Noticing that Collateral Beauty was playing for a one night early screening at our local cinema so off we went, with an excellent cast including Kate Winslet, Will Smith and Helen Mirren it had a real chanceand I am so glad we did, what an excellent movie, Will Smith was superb, supported by a great cast, ignore the negative reviews, sometimes you just want to appreciate life and also understand that the time we have is limited so enjoy your friends and family while you can.

I loved the link between the three spirits (love, death, and time) and every character of the story. The spirits (who have been considered real humans till the end of the movie)were paid by three people to let everybody understand that a man who have lost his daughter was not ready to take decisions for the company that they work for. However, the spirits helped this man who have lost faith in love, who his daughter died, and who did not care about the time anymore; and a at the same time the three spirits helped the three people who hired them. The spirit of death helped the man who had a cancer and was dying, the spirit of the time helped the woman who with the passing of the time did not manage to have a baby, an the spirit of love helped the divorced man who needed to conquer the love ho her daughter who hates him because she considered his father guilty of the divorce. At the end, the two words ""collateral beauty"" said by the spirit of death sound like magic. They could mean everything we understand. For me they mean: the beauty behind the drama, the joy of keep going despite the bad things that happen in our life, the love to share our hope with somebody that we really care about. In conclusion, this movie give a sensation of magic in the air, it is an original classic movie which will not let you down.",Collateral Beauty
286,haydenmcallister-02913,A Great Film,10,15 February 2017,"I saw this movie with a girlfriend. Normally we disagree on what we see, but after watching Collateral Beauty we both gave it top marks. After arriving back home we looked at some of the reviews from the professional critics and couldn't believe the belittling comments some of them had made. It was as if they had all agreed to slag off the film, and have a collective pop at Will Smith. We even wondered whether we were living on a parallel universe where everything is the reverse of what it is here! This is a very deep movie, with some great acting, especially from Will Smith. The themes were those that affect everyone, Love, Time, and Death. And ultimately, the film hints at the collateral beauty which we totally miss when bereaved, and rarely see during a normal busy day. Should have won an Oscar for best film, and Will Smith for best actor. And I think ""Time"" will prove the critics very wrong.",Collateral Beauty

I won't go in depth about this movie as other reviewers had already done so, but this is a MUST SEE movie if you are a compassionate person who can connect with one's loss and how painfully it is to accept life's tragedies but is also able to treasure the ""beauty"" and the times you spent together before the tragedy.",Collateral Beauty

291,cmb-54959,Enjoy it at face value,7,14 October 2018,"I often feel it must be difficult to be a film critic. Yes it seems an easy job just watching films and then writing a review. But they always need an angle. They HAVE to write something, so it's difficult for them to just take a film at face value. Many films which are thought of as classics can also be viewed as schmaltzy or manipulating. But sometimes it's ok just to enjoy a film and be taken wherever it wants to take you for 90 minutes. I watched this on a cold damp Sunday evening and enjoyed it for what it was. An enjoyable story of someone dealing with almost suicidal grief. It's a story of love and loss and how that love and loss is so different when it's the love of a child rather than a love between husband and wife/boyfriend and girlfriend. We all had a life before we met our loved ones. We all had a life before our children but the arrival of the latter changes us in a way that means a return to the life we led before is impossible when the child is taken away. With a break up or divorce we may meet someone else, maybe develop an even better relationship. Not so with the loss of a child. This film deals with that loss which is felt so deeply it consumes Will Smiths character making life seem worthless. Watch it without judgement. A film that makes you think about life and love and loss and how to cope is worthy in itself without being judged in an overly critical way.",Collateral Beauty

It starts off well enough and then halfway through the movie it just stopped going anywhere significant. This movie missed on every mark, despite good performances by nearly all involved. This was simply a script too sappy for its own good. Instead of telling a good story, it seems like the main intent was to try to get a tear out of you.Smith's character has distinct interactions in which he neither grows nor changes in any noticeable way.There are twists for no other reason than to just have twists. Perhaps the writers thought they were being so clever, but the twists were just pointless and gag-worthy.And one scene in particular with Norton's character and his daughter was just so poorly done for no better reason than to just put a big happy bow on the situation for maximum sappiness.PASS",Collateral Beauty

300,vivijanae,Honestly I'm blow away!,9,21 May 2019,"This movie was phenomenal! The themes are beautiful and heart wrenching and so good all at the same time. First of all, the music in this film is incredible! The score is beautiful, and the soundtrack adds just the right feelings. From the very beginning of the movie with the song ""Way Down We Go"" by KALEO you get that sense of despair and disregard for life. You really begin to understand the pain Howard is feeling. The opening scene really hits you right where it hurts with the song and the dominoes falling down, showing just how impermanent things really are.
Also what an amazing cast! I have always loved Will Smith but he was spectacular in this movie! By including other big names like Kate Winslet and Keira Knightly I was intrigued from the beginning. I loved that even though the movie dealt with a specific kind of mourning it applied to all kinds, and the pain and ups and downs that come with loss of any kind.
I think there's so much you can learn from this movie, about life and death and pain and progress. The scene that has stuck in my head is Love's/Amy's speech to Howard about love. It's so powerful! And she's right. There's pain in loss, but there's love too; after all, you wouldn't miss it if you didn't really love it. It's so hard to find the good amidst the bad, but this movie shows some of the steps it takes to get there. They're not always easy, they're not comfortable, and the grief is normal, but there is light at the end of the tunnel if you look for it.
I agree that there are a few problems with the plot, but overall those were lost among the beauty and sweeping feelings of the film. Seeing Howard's development, seeing his extreme lows and what grief can really be like, carry the story so well that any inconsistencies seem unimportant. The plot had so many unanticipated twists and it was a pleasure to be shocked.
Overall, I would definitely recommend this movie! It's beautiful and painful all at the same time and it leaves you thinking about so much. Truly a wonderful movie despite what the critics say.",Collateral Beauty

The film is easy and pleasant to watch. It contains many touching sincere moments.How often do we ask questions to the universe in the hope to get answers? How hard is to let go the past and find yourself again? How often do we complain that we do not have the time, not realizing that time is a gift and we spend it on unimportant things? The 'Collateral Beauty' has many tears, mostly relevant and capable of causing a lump in the throat. Also in the film are a lot of monologues, dialogues and sometimes long pauses to think about the last said things.It is really worth to go through whole film for a very strong emotional ending that gets together sometimes strange scenes of the film.I really love psychology aspects of this film. It has an appeal to abstract concepts and simple human relations, to understanding of the relationships between all people on the planet. And I don't have words to describe magnificent and exceptional acting of Will Smith... He is simply genius. In general, film leaves a deep impression and makes you wonder: is it worth to be so worry about your problems while there is Love, Time is passing and Death is coming closer?",Collateral Beauty

The only thing which made me little disappointed was the ending, i felt it was incomplete, something was missing. This movie started same as we saw in trailer . Will Smith's friends and partners - Kate Winslet , Edward Norton and Michael Peña actually appoint characters to play Love ,Time and death , when they know that Will Smith 's character Howard writing letters to Time death and love after loosing his child.They shoot the videos while Howard is talking to love time and death and remove those character digitally so it looked like that Howard is talking to himself, As proof they show this to board members just to prove that Howard is not in normal state of mind to run his agency. they all wanna save their jobs too but they are equally concerned about Howard as well. The story is beyond any doubt original. I loved the fact that beside the main story there are tree side stories which all have their meaning and depth. Everything fits nicely together (maybe even too much) and the final result is a sad but entertaining drama which will likely hit you on a greater emotional level. There's also a surprise twist which I just didn't see coming. i wanted to see happy ending for each character but they only showed for Smith, rest we imagined for other characters. give this movie one shot if you like real emotional drama with great actors and their performances and also the movie includes amazing twists till the end.the movie takes you through stages of what actually is love, time and deaths beautiful portrayed by kiera, jacob & helen, if you are the one that cries in movies, carry a pair of tissues, this will keep you glued with teary eyed smiling face.Go for it for will smith and all characters .",Collateral Beauty

But after watching this film myself I realized the audience score, which averages over three times higher than the critic score for Collateral Beauty is the one to listen too. The film is crafted in a beautiful way that really shows a untypical approach to the subject matter. It is an important film for people to see regardless if you are a fan of dramas. The film speaks in great reflection about human connection, grief and trauma; all topics that we sometimes avoid to our detriment.

330,dktbrwn,One of the best films of this decade,10,25 March 2017,"The idea is profound and complex. I was so upset to see the negative reviews in regards to this film. 'We long for love, wish for more time, and fear death'.The opening scene of the film shows Will Smith speaking to the company. The film shows exactly how love, death and time appear in our lives when we need them most. Edward Norton speaks to his daughter and she rejects him, and then Love(Keira Knightley) in the very next scene appears to him. The 'actors' are not actors at all they are figments of each persons imagination. They never actually hired anyone. And its the reason why each person is separated by the lesson they need to learn the most, Edward Norton(Love), Micheal Pena(Death), Kate Winslet(Time), and Will Smith(Love,Death,Time). Its the same reason why Will Smiths wife sees death in the hospital when she's losing their child. Its the reason why he always is setting up dominoes in the movie, it shows how one touch leads to destruction, but we can choose to see the collateral beauty in the dominoes and how they fall with music. But he doesn't choose to see the beauty he starts the first domino and walks away refusing to see any of it. I strongly encourage anyone who didn't like this film, to watch it again from this perspective. Everything comes together.",Collateral Beauty

Every damn thing about this movie was cliché. I laughed at parts that were supposed to be somehow meaningful. My take-away from this movie:Never, ever, ever rely on IMDb vote rate to judge a movie Popular actors make awful movies all the time If your gut says the movie will be bad, trust your gut.I have never written a review on this website, but this movie FORCED me to make one, just because of how misleading the rating of this movie is.I have learned a good lesson now.",Collateral Beauty

336,sandeepyn,Must Miss,1,23 December 2016,"A half hearted or probably a quarter hearted attempt at a story which could have been a great movie with the right direction. Director fails to portray what he has in his thoughts, movie looks more like a college project which was done just for the heck of doing it. Wonder if will smith had not done due diligence on the background of the director. The movie seems like the director almost took the audience for granted. Parts of the movies are very clichéd and you also start wondering as to what the director is trying to convey after 10 mins through the movie.Wish directors take time in spanning out the story and connect it to what they want to convey properly",Collateral Beauty

My daughter asked me to accompany her as she wanted to see the movie so I went along expecting it to be awful. It wasn't. The three actors that play Time, Love and Death are magical and perfectly cast. Helen Mirren plays Death, Jacob Latimore plays Time and Keira Knightly plays Love. Howard (Will Smith) eventually accepts the idea that he's talking to actual Death in a blue hat, to actual Love in a pink coat, to actual Time that rides a skateboard. At the end of the movie, my daughter and I could not move from our seats as we were so overwhelmed by emotion. It got me! For a movie to provoke that kind of reaction in me, I know it really hit the mark. Don't believe what the critics say. It is a great movie!",Collateral Beauty

341,ravelnv,Could be better... but is not a complete disaster,8,19 March 2017,"It could have been a great thing... come on... Helen, Keira, Kate, Edward, Will!!! All this talent had to mean something... but yet, I know that expectation is the path to destruction. So, I went to this movie with my heart wide open. No expecting too much, neither too less. Something in the middle. So, while I was watching it - and getting emotional, by the way - I realized that Howard (Smith) wasn't the one who need the help from Death, Love and Time. If was it, he would be the one to meet them. But this was not what happened. In fact Howard was grieving, but he was trying. The letters represented he fighting against his depression. A way to fix himself. However, even if they were apparently well, his friends were fighting against time, love and death but they were not looking for help. They were losing the battle against themselves. So Howard was just an excuse. He understood the three more important things in life, but to his friends those concepts were unknown. People watch this movie expecting great things, but the messages are simple. Love while time does not allow death to act. Beucase death makes no bargains, death makes no concessions and only love can be greater then both of them, because love is in time and in death, and in everything in between.",Collateral Beauty

But the script is very novel and kept me engaged throughout. This is something which I can't really say for most of the recent ""blockbusters"" of late. It may not be the feel- good movie of the year but has plenty of positive messages and a very good twist. It has a surprising list of good actors. Will Smith is very believable. Norton and Winslet do their part well. Different people will interpret the meaning of the words Collateral Beauty differently. The movie I think conveyed the message that pain and tragedy can still effervesce so many beautiful emotions (love, kindness etc) as byproduct, and that its up to us to make an effort to experience the fullness of all life has to offer.",Collateral Beauty

I will never understand how critics can rave over trash evil nonsense. I am grateful to see that there are still a few Hollywood film makers investing in stories that move people to think and dig inside to feel given the plethora of stupidity out there. It was impressed to see such an amazing cast portray each role as if it had been written specifically for them. It was clever to use the subjects as the source of anger and then expose the true aspects of each of those subjects and all that they embody to bring about understanding of the real truth.

At the beginning, it was different than I thought but the ending tied in everything.Wil Smith movies don't disappoint, he's so gifted and talented in showing true emotions. I cried at the end after the movie. Collateral Beauty was a movie that taught a lesson and everyone could learn from this one loss that Wil Smith has encountered . Im going to watch the movie again. I loved it that much!!! Job well done. I don't understand the bad reviews at all. Its not a typical Christmas movie with a happy Christmas, but a sad one.

It is the presence of absence that intrigues the audience. When love is lost, it is found. When time is lost, it is found. The absence of light is darkness, but darkness itself is not a presence. It is a total ruin when the trio stood on the bridge, revealing to the audience their ""real identity."" Whoever decide on it, you insulted the audience, destroyed the aesthetics, like serving skittles as deserts, wasting all the good food (energy) as delivered by each of the key characters. However, each of the character is mostly enjoyable and the acting without acting is highly entertaining. Good job for the soundtracks.

354,brandon-67304,Honest Thoughts on Collateral Beauty,1,13 April 2017,"First of all, I want to point out that the review on this movie from this site is completely wrong. It comes no where near a 5, much less a 6 or 7. It's like watching a high school play where people are pretending to act. I was shocked to see Will Smith and Edward Norton in the same film to witness such a horrible script they had to follow. Someone wrote that this movie has heart and that's why it deserves a great review. Come on guys, doesn't most movies have heart? We should be rating this based on how well the script was, the acting and overall plot. In that regard, it completely sucked. It's not a movie you should sit down with family to watch unless you just wanted something to play to pass time. This is an honest review of this movie. Also, IMDb needs to start giving better reviews. I don't know how many people think their reviews are off these days.",Collateral Beauty

If you are emotionally intelligent, then Collateral Beauty could be your best movie ever. If not, then ... tough luck ! Knowing that I am a person with a decent EQ - I have found this movie as a piece of art. It had it all and did not lack a digit.Will smith proves that he is one of the best in the business and no one could have played ""Edward Howard"" better than him.

It's a movie I will recommend to anyone who has lost a loved one. It's therapeutic, hilarious, implicitly godly, and surprisingly ""twisty."" It's a movie an intelligent mind will watch over and over again. It's so real especially, to a parent who has lost a child.... From a nurse's perspective, watching Howard, the actor, appears as if the story of a grieving heart is unfolding before the world. Oh, how parallel Collateral Beauty is to life, real life. Being a parent who has lost a child, Collateral Beauty could not have been acted any better. Will Smith is certainly dazzling. Collateral Beauty is superb!",Collateral Beauty

359,ufukisbitiren,Where is the beauty?,9,24 December 2016,"There are many metaphorical things from the beginning till the end of the movie. The question for the viewer is that where collateral beauty under all negative things. In my view, a great girl is killed by 'death' so as to give life to three friends and the main character himself. This is very sad but the life of others unfortunately are bounded this little kid. Will Smith's can only leave his job because of her death, the guy who is going to die soon can only live his last days happily after seeing a young kid's early death, and Wit can only struggle for his daughter after meeting 'love'. However, my vote is for the wife. The weakly depicted wife of Smith. She waits for her husband and leads him to recover patiently. She acts perfectly and deserves to be the secret heroine of the movie.",Collateral Beauty

They both did an outstanding performance as one would expect. The three main actresses were Kate Winslet, Keira Knightley and Helen Mirren. I have always viewed both Kate Winslet and Helen Mirren as above average actresses and they did not disappoint me in the slightest. However, the gorgeous Keira Knightley really let me down. I would have to watch the film a second time to attempt to pinpoint whether it was because of the script or if she failed in her acting but in either case her role was below average. There was a lot of great acting, it was thought provoking, differently brought a lot of sniffles from both the women and the men in the audience, and the movie even provided a few unexpected twist.

I can't think of a movie starring Will Smith that I've regretted immersing myself in. A necessary see for anyone who has experienced tragedy through loss. I for one don't always watch a movie for that ""feel good"" feeling....I enjoy watching a movie that is both raw and brutally honest. This movie gave me that experience and allowed me to reach places in my soul that aren't easily reached. It can be uncomfortable yet comforting in an extraordinary way that only a great story line and excellent acting can drive home. Ignore the poor reviews and see this movie!!",Collateral Beauty

Watched several of the SAG and Golden Globe movie nominations and this one was heads up ahead of them all (so far) except Hacksaw Ridge...but was a close 2nd. The movie was heart wrenching, thought-provoking, touching and scattered throughout with humor. Tough subject and had an ending I didn't see coming. The actors were convincing and had me trying to imagine myself in their shoes...what would I say given the ""job."" While this didn't start or even end as a totally feel-good movie, the story line was compelling and intricate with the key roles having some sort of challenge in their lives, not all of which end happily.

I have never before seen such a supremely talented cast acting in a bomb of a film like this one. Helen Mirren! Will Smith! Fire your agents for suggesting such rubbish. Kate Winslett - why do you appear so pale and drawn? - is it because you realized it was just too late to get out of the contract? I found the only enjoyable thing about viewing this film was the state-of-the-art chair with footrest, that I viewed it from.

Unfortunately the only other movie we (I) were (was) interested in seeing was sold out. So since she had her heart set on a movie we went to Collateral Beauty. And guess what, we both liked it. Obviously the topic is a sad topic, and there were some emotional moments, but there were also good doses of mystery, a little intrigue, and even humor to keep it quite interesting. It won't answer your questions on ""why we're here"" or offer up any other deep meanings, but who cares, because I left the theater feeling good. Interesting ending too.",Collateral Beauty
365,rickmetheny,Critics got it wrong,8,1 January 2017,"Reading through the professional critics reviews of this film, I wonder if they really watched the movie or just riffed off of each other because their shallow observations are so similar. This is not action hero Will Smith.....this is a man who lost his little girl and the happy, charismatic character in the beginning is the contrast before the fall. Were his partners being deceitful in an attempt to pull Smith's character back from the brink, as suggested by the critics, or were they the unwitting accomplices of their correlates, Love, Time, and Death - the mantra of their business. Einstein explained relativity saying, ""Put your hand on a hot stove for a minute, and it seems like an hour. Sit with a pretty girl for an hour, and it seems like a minute"". This movie falls in the second category. My wife and I were so engrossed in the film that that the 90 and a couple minutes run time flew by and the ending......you just don't see it coming and it smacks you.We loved the movie and would watch it again in a minute. You should give it your time.",Collateral Beauty
366,poneill-69920,Highly recommended beautiful little movie,8,2 January 2017,"Enjoyed this film so much I signed up to IMDb just to review it......The film tells the story of four colleagues/friends, Howard (Will Smith), Whit (the ever reliable Ed Norton), Claire (Kate Winslet) and Simon (Michael Pena). The film pivots around how Howard deals with (or rather doesn't deal with) the death of his six year old daughter and the impact it has on the other three. I don't want to give away too much but an unusual (slightly implausible) scenario results in Howard meeting Love, Death and Time who end up imparting some wisdom not just to him but also to his three friends. Whilst there are undoubtedly sad moments, I found the film to be touching, thought provoking, entertaining, amusing and very unique. Ultimately this is a the film about life and death and the beauty of existence, delivered in a somewhat ""Hollywoodesque"" manner. So yes at times there is an air of cheesiness but it still manages to be heart warming without being over the top. I didn't mind the ""Hollywood"" feel as personally I find some arty films can veer towards being slow, self indulgent and pretentious, which this is not (maybe that's why the critics didn't like it?)The acting is top notch - all the main cast are excellent and Helen Mirren is scene stealing yet again.Overall I found this to be a charming little movie which made me leave the cinema thinking about the wonder of life, and isn't that what art is supposed to be about ????So if you like films like It's a Wonderful Life or The Family man ignore the critics, go see this film, I'm glad I did",Collateral Beauty

The mood of the movie was almost quiet, a departed change from most maybe that's why critics slammed it so. I most appreciated it was A very original story, dealing with everyday life. well cast while I thought Kate Winslet could have been so much more.

Will Smith is a brilliant actor, and he portrays Howard impeccably. The pain that the character of Howard would have been feeling really shows in this film. Although the film is based around Howard losing his daughter, if you have ever lost anyone you will relate to his pain. Beautiful story line and honestly the best film that I have ever watched.

Yes, the topics addressed - the loss of a child, the inevitability of death, the regret of a life wasted chasing what doesn't satisfy - are portrayed in a deeply emotional way. But it felt honest to me and it was cathartic. And I wouldn't be surprised if Will Smith gets an Academy Award for his performance. So take a chance. Ignore the critics. Prove them wrong.

And most critical reviewers'd better change job, I can not say whether they are more obtuse or more in bad faith. An existentialist film, speaking about real and common situations of suffering in a sincere direct but gentle way. And also with a light humor which is typical of the serious things of real life. It is time for our neurotic society to start talking about real things in real life that we pretend are no more: loneliness, sickness and death. And above all it is time we start talking about it together. And found a new direction too. The end of this movie is very beautiful, smart and - almost - unexpected. I admit that -even considering myself very Viking style- in the end, as a dad, I spent one tear, more of surprise and joy than pain. Highly recommended to everybody!",Collateral Beauty

372,kellogg-19366,Beautiful movie about Grief and Loss,9,11 January 2017,"Collateral Beauty captures the feelings of loss, grief and hopelessness so very well. I lost my wife 6 months ago and Will Smith does such a good job of portraying the inner turmoil and struggle to find meaning in life. Putting effort into useless tasks like stacking dominoes in hopes of honoring your lost loved one, wandering aimlessly because you have the time and money to do anything, but nothing seems meaningful anymore now that the love is gone from your life, and reaching out to entities, or God, or the universe in hopes of answers are all things I can relate to on a very personal basis.The wonderful thing about this movie is it takes that feeling throughout the movie and weaves in a tapestry of other feelings from the other characters, their own fears and hopes, their wonder about whether they are doing the right thing as they try to answer how to help Howard, and ultimately themselves, move forward.",Collateral Beauty

Somehow just simply writing a letter and receiving a response and become more than an outdated action. This filmed provided answers to questions I hadn't even thought to ask. Complete with plot twists and empowering messages, this isn't a film to miss. While I am bias to any film that Smith acts in, you have to really see it for yourself. I don't cry much in films and this didn't change that for me, but I felt a build-up of emotion that was exciting to experience. See it for yourself, if you don't want to spend $12 on a film you may or may not like, then wait until it comes out in the local video store (if those are still available), it's worth checking out for yourself. This film invites many different perspectives and no matter what the writers and the rest of the cast should be proud of their work.",Collateral Beauty
375,emmanora,A deep movie,10,22 January 2017,"This is a movie that really makes you think and value what you have, appreciate all the blessings around you.All actors played their roles exactly as they should & they've succeeded no matter how long or short their lines were. Many moments of truth, honesty and sometimes reality that we see everyday around us in different ways. Sometimes we need a ""wake up"" message to re-evaluate what is not running well and get it fixed. Pick the track you want to have in life. Make the best use of your relationships. Well done all the cast. One of the very best movies ever.",Collateral Beauty
376,michellesalter,A great film with a fantastic cast,9,27 January 2017,Yet another occasion that I'm glad I didn't listen to the critics. This film had everything in it for me and Will Smith once again showed what a fantastic actor he truly is. It has a great cast of award nominees (including Dame Helen Mirren) who make this film a real roller-coaster of emotions. Each actor having their own unique part to play giving the film great depth. This is my first ever review on IMDb and it's because I enjoyed the film so much and I believe the critics got it so very wrong on this occasion! I felt I had to stand behind the film and great actors to prove this is not the underdog of films but can stand side by side with many great films.,Collateral Beauty
377,jeromeledeley,Nice but.. (possible spoiler),6,3 February 2017,"A moving movie, to which I would have given a much better rating only if the scene between the hero and the group therapist wouldn't have turned this way close to the end.I find it very disappointing, as far as the scenario is concerned, as if it were necessary to unfold one's history and re-conciliate with one's past, rather than create a new one, a new hope, a new life, towards which the movie seems to give clues.I've been there watching the movie, in which I was believing close to its end, when I watched the scene, I said no no no, what the .. have the scenarists done ?? The end is nice, though, as the whole movie, apart from that. I don't know whether the movie comes from a book or real story, and if so, I apologize to the scenarists.",Collateral Beauty

F the critics who have never created a movie in their life and gave less than 5 stars! watch it. Privately if you can Will Smith acts a mentally unstable and does a really good job.Movie is synergized during the whole length period. Too bad it was left without the relationship that was developing with the other two heroes of the movie. they just left it for us to figure out.,Collateral Beauty
379,snoopydog-04591,A movie that really understood the meaning of life...,9,27 February 2017,"This is the first movie that I have watched that addresses the meaning of life but in a way that it focuses on the real emotions that many go through. Unlike other movies, it doesn't pull on the strings of the obvious emotions. Instead, 'Collateral Beauty' structured itself in the form of spoken word poetry. Taking the viewer into a roller-coaster of true emotion. This movie isn't your ordinary drama but it's one that needs you to really understand the fight that people go through when either, losing or have lost a battle in life.Many would give this a poor rating as they would expect Smith to be his usual comedian. Many would fail to understand the connection of faith, hope and illusion.",Collateral Beauty
380,brendandavey,Most thought provoking movie in a while.,9,27 February 2017,"If you like to engage your brain as well as being entertained then this movie is for you. This movie is thought provoking with many threads weaved together within the main plot. Not all of them are resolved within the movie, and it leaves you with many ""but what about..."" or ""why didn't they.....""If you are looking for something different from all the action movies, then this is worth looking at.",Collateral Beauty
381,cartwrightkieron,This movie changed my outlook on life.,10,28 February 2017,"No words can describe how utterly amazing this film is, my whole life - for the good 13 years i have been in it - consisted of crap i don't need to worry about. Time is what you make it. Love is not what you are on the outside but what impact you make to the person who loves you back. Death is not the end, yet i still think there is no heaven. I type these words so that maybe one single person will read this and know I'm not any average secondary school student. I am whoever i want to be, no one but me dictates what i do on this short life we live. Now you can go and laugh at me and say ""What would a 13 year old know"" because i really don't care. Life is what i want it to be whether good or bad. And so as i conclude my review ill leave you with one thing, I love who i am, i love life, i understand death and i don't care what anyone else says.",Collateral Beauty
382,dstacey-11409,Most adults will appreciate this rendition of a heart felt story masterly portrayed.,9,3 March 2017,"Not all movies need to follow the same text book and vanilla plot and story line. This piece was beautifully written, exceptionally portrayed and delivered every bit of emotion it was meant to.While I'll be honest in the fact that it definitely wasn't Edward Norton's best piece of work and disappointingly he brought down the over all quality of this film, Will Smith (as always) boosted this challenging story to a height beyond expectation. The supporting cast was also extremely strong and aided in the overall success of this film.In reading the other reviews, I've heard this story as being a sad one. Without question, it's based on an extremely sad under tone however, I believe the over arching message that morphs from this is far deeper and draws out inspiration, courage, love and understanding. Watch it. It's worth it.",Collateral Beauty
383,tonycoldfield-17345,Masterpiece if you can see what they see,10,3 March 2017,"My review really can't do justice to how impressive this film was. The music selected compliments the film perfectly, the script is simple yet clever and the acting was strong and well balanced throughout. But what really hit home for me in this film was the depth of the words chosen to describe the meaning of collateral beauty and allowed me to understand the underlying meaning wholeheartedly.If you look at it on the surface alone and just see it as some wishy washy feel good film sure, you won't think it anything special. But if you reflect on your life and you ask yourself about what makes you happy and how you can keep that happiness with sad times constantly entering your life, then this film might show you something you've never looked at in life and for that it's more than just a 10/10 film.",Collateral Beauty
384,janehill-99853,Wow...to the negitive reviewers and for the greater public.,8,4 March 2017,"To the person looking for an honest review... First this film in my opinion is fantastic. It is well crafted, well directed and well acted.Normally I follow the ratings on IMDb quite closely and rarely enjoy a film below a 7 unless it is about something I am truly interested in. Now I admit that on first viewing the film might seem a little confusing but if your willing to watch it again then you can see how truly remarkable it is and how it was truly done a disservice by its marketing (ironic much?) but in the marketing's defense, this film is hard to market without spoiling something. So instead of trying to keep everything a secret they expose everything which is doubted because of the beginning. Please watch and figure out whether you like it or not yourself instead of relying on the opinions of others who have nothing good to say about anything (i.e. the entire gaming community).Now if your reading this without seeing the movie, I would highly suggest not reading farther because this is where the major spoilers will be stated.On first watch you might come to believe that Love, Death and Time are just actors being hired by the assholes trying to take the business away from Howard or you will come to believe that they are actually who they pretend to be but be confused to why they needed to come in contact with Whit, Clair and Simon and create something so complicated. Answers: They are who they portray and not only are they effecting Howard but helping all the others around him. Death talks to Simon who is dying. Time talks to Clair who is done trying to have a kid because she doesn't believe she has time. Love talks to Whit who struggles because he feels like he is loosing the love of his daughter and is starting to give up on her. Everything they are saying starts to now make sense and the fact that death talked to Howard's wife also makes sense.",Collateral Beauty

This is a deep, DEEP movie. Philosiphically deep, I mean. A place where movies usually fear to tread. Hats-off, to stellar acting by all.

Another Hollywood movie that pretends to give us some truths about the life, but just polishes the surface and gives people completely wrong picture what the pain of loosing someone is. On the plus side, it tries to raise the awareness of the problem that people avoid like a fire and nice music too.",Collateral Beauty

This was a happy, sad, edge of your seat, funny, fantastic, and spiritual movie. To have a cast that ultimately can carry out the message of this measure doesn't always happen but when it does, the movie has just gone from good to Fantastic. A movie is only as good as it's able to be related to, so ultimately not everyone will have the same viewpoint. I absolutely loved this movie, as I myself am working on creating a meaningful life, lived with much love, am seeking a higher purpose to what life actually is versus what it really is. If we take our time to love life everyday than ultimately we have lived beyond death, with no fear of death, and only love to make our world bigger and brighter. This film has the capacity to change the spirit of everyone who watches it, whether or not they are ready to face the change. Thank you to the entire cast, writers, and everyone behind the scenes for believing in love.",Collateral Beauty

All the actors did an amazing performance doing his own character with passion and dedication. The main character (Will Smith) is one of my favorites actors and this film isn't his exception. His performance makes a before and an after into the film that makes you are in the story. Before I saw the film, I believed that the film was going to be the Christmas's's topic but during the story I knew that it is all except a topic. The end was the most beautiful and unexpected part of the story. In conclusion, this film can't have any bad review because is an untypical film that has an amazing plot.",Collateral Beauty

392,swisner-61145,Don't be afraid to like it,8,11 August 2017,"It is OK to see and like Collateral Beauty no matter what the critics say. It isn't a happy movie but it ends happily. It isn't a movie rich in scenery or special effects, no romantic side story or even much complexity, no snappy soundtrack. In many ways, it is about life's challenges and how people each struggle with their own in their own ways. It is a simple movie with a lot of things to think about. I felt for the characters no matter what their individual struggle was. I wanted each of them to find peace and resolution to some very real, life changing situations. And, at the end of the movie, I was glad that I had seen it. I will likely see it a few more times. There is more to this movie than the professional critics would ever see. Its OK to like this movie.",Collateral Beauty

This film, for me, was a breath of fresh air focusing on real feelings, real issues and it was supported by an absolutely stellar cast. I say, BRAVO! and ""think for yourself"" rather than listening to the critics and particularly Rotten Tomatoes. Thank you for a viewing experience which took me away from ceaseless, useless violence and dissent. This film is hard to watch but for honest, decent reasons, not because of made up violence in films or from subjecting myself to the evening news. Just watching the domino scenes made the price of admission worthwhile. When Will Smith ventures into films with actual, honest emotions he wins. I recommend renting ""7 Pounds,"" another Will Smith film.",Collateral Beauty
395,lennypitt,Completely Misunderstood By Negative Reviewers,10,6 January 2018,"Ok, this will be my first IMDB review. Having said that... this isnt really a review it is an attempt to make people understand the film. So let me just say this... its a great film. Go see it.I felt compelled to review this movie as I find it astounding that so many negative reviewers have completely misinderstood the plot.
Let's just focus on the two main points that negative critics focus on...1. Negative critics in the majority claim this movie is a gross portayal of emotional manipulation performed on a trio of friends to another. Without denying that the trio have been driven to concocting this loopy plan to translate love death and time into real beings, lets not forget the lightbulb moment for this plan came when Kiera Knightleys character 'Love' caught Ed Nortons attention and duped him into following her back to a 'theatre' where the three soon to be employed 'actors' including Kiera Knightley are rehearsing. SPOILER: CRITICS YOU SEEM TO HAVE MISSED THAT THOSE THREE ACTORS ARE ACTUALLY ANGELS!!! THEY ARE THE ONES PERFORMING THE MANIPULATION. AND THEY ARE DOING SO TO HELP THE THREE FRIENDS DEAL WITH HUGE ISSUES IN THIER LIVES!!! AS WELL AS WILL SMITHS.Let's get this straight. The friends are manipulating no one. The angels are manipulating if you must call it that... although it isnt that, its helping the friends to deal with thier issues and to look at thier own lives and problems WHILST ensuring Will Smiths life is put back on track. The 3 friends of Will are completely led down a garden path by these angels in a beautiful way and for incredibe reasons. I feel some critics do not have the emotional IQ to have understood this. Or even actual IQ. I saw one critic question why others could not see the characters of 'love' 'time' and 'Death'... they are angels mate... and can be seen by whomever they want, whenever they want. Jeez Helen Mirren even says it!!!2. The second point to make is that people think the film misconstrued how grief and love is felt! HA! HILARIOUS. Who are these people to say how everyone would deal with certain emotions. Who are they to say how every person would deal with the rekindling of a romance that has been extinguished for a prolonged period over extremely strenupus circumstances. They are no one thats who. This is a FILM made about this particular group of peoples struggle with emotion. If you want a genuine reflection of how people deal with grief and love go stand outside a funeral home as well as a church and ask people how they feel as they come out. This is a wonderful story about a mans struggle to reconnect with life and the intervention of spiritual beings.And thats just it for me. Why do movies these days have to contain other worldly, hard to understand plots that create more questions than answers these days? Whats wrong with good old fashioned story telling. Which is exactly what this is. Its beautiful.",Collateral Beauty
396,ikestroud,Just another bad film,1,15 September 2017,The movie is slow moving with a poor plot. Will Smith struggles to fit the character of a battled father. His character is not convincing.

The movie does hit the mark in that it really stirs your thoughts and emotions.
I watched this movie over 2 months ago, and I cannot tell you how many times I have caught myself thinking about the movie! There are layers after layers. What a fantastic film! 
If you want something all processed and chewed up for you, then this probably isn't for you. If you want a story that makes you evaluate your own life, and makes you think about your own circumstances (without providing answers I might add) this is perfect. The answers are yours to find and are not included in the movie btw. 
Lastly, the acting: Smith, Norton, Pena, and Knightly, wow! Excellent! 
Smith however was simply astonishing. I really felt for him throughout the movie. I know he was acting, but I sincerely wanted to reach into the screen and give that poor man a hug. 
Watch this movie. Thank me later.",Collateral Beauty

Will Smith gave an incredible performance, I reckon all the actors did so. The plot was clever and even though it isn´t an exhilarating action film, it has some twists that make it very exciting at the end. It was beautiful and romantic and painful.

402,svenmason,Ideas about What Happened,6,12 March 2018,"I didn't really enjoy this movie, but then like often happens later that night ideas start bouncing around and I can see something a bit deeper that redeems it. I have not seen reviewers mention these ideas so I thought I would write them up here in case it helps others appreciate them (or reject them if mis-thought).This involves the overall plot, so is all spoilers.When I watched it, I thought the story was stupid, how the people acted was silly, and that it was just a waste of time and talent. I sad guy is manipulated by his friends to try and get him to sell the company. The lady in the help group was actually his wife, that is kind of cool but then the lady on the chair when the daughter is passing is actually the old actor, stupid coincidence.But then its not, because now I believe the three actors were actually Love, Time and Death. Might have been manifestations or in someones head.Could have been they manifested for the three partners, who all had their connections with each: Absent father who needed to be forced back into loving his daughter, the dying man who needed to come to terms with death, the aging woman whose time to have a child has passed. In this scenario Howard may have had no need for them, he was already on his way to recovery, it is the three partners who needed them.Or it could have all been in Howard's head, the partners never contracted anyone, he imagined it all as a way to talk with these concepts and find his way through the grief and realize the needs of his partners, to find a way to help them.Clues: 
the direct connection between each contracted actor and the partner they interact with.the way they appear on the bridge but are not really there.the impossible situation of the the older actor being in the hospital with the wife.the video with them digitally edited out, possible but would be really difficult.I think no-one else in the movie interacts with the three constructs except Howard and the three partners?",Collateral Beauty

There was nothing on tv, Good Will Hunting was nearly over, but this had just started, 3 mins in. I had seen an ad for this before and thought it looked contrived and cliche. But the ads don't do it justice, it took me completely by surprise! It is a really beautiful story about a Father grieving for the death of his daughter. A storyline done before but I have never seen another film or book approach it in this way, it is incredibly uplifting and engaging. Be prepared to cry as it is emotional (and I hate to cry at films but you cant help but cry at this!)
