0,bkoganbing,Brandon Teena --- 1972-1993,10,9 December 2006,"At the tender of age 21 it was all over for Brandon Teena as young Teena Brandon had presented himself to the world. Two young men murdered him in the small town of Humboldt, Nebraska, unable to cope with the existence of someone outside of the norms they were carefully taught. The world took little notice of Brandon's passing back then. But when the relatively inexpensive production of Boy's Don't Cry got rave reviews resulting in an first Oscar for Hilary Swank, his story became known the world over.It's only been in the past decade that the transgender right movement spun out on its own from the general gay/lesbian civil rights cause. Stories like Brandon Teena's or Gwen Araujo's or one of Moses Preston Waller, a case that I was familiar with back in my working days at the New York State Crime Victims Board have brought the ugliest manifestation of discrimination that transgendered people face, that of loss of life. A terrible price to raise the consciousness of the general public. Teena Brandon was born in Lincoln, Nebraska a biological woman and moved to Humboldt later on where she reversed her name and presented himself to the public as Brandon Teena. It's what Brandon saw inside himself, what he felt to the depths of his soul. As a man he won and wooed a woman played in the film by Chloe Sevigny, but some of the redneck crowd Brandon hung out with suspected something afoot. Including some of Chloe Sevigny's relatives.The brutal rape and killing of Brandon Teena is probably only comparable to the honor killings that are sanctioned by some extreme branches of Islam. It was as if their own honor, their own sense of masculine self was compromised by him even touching a woman. They reaffirmed their flagging masculinity with rape and purged the family of dishonor with a homicide. And they felt totally justified in doing it which is the real scary part.When I was a kid of eleven I remember when it was a foregone conclusion that Susan Hayward would be an Oscar winner for I'll Cry Tomorrow. Years later it was also concluded for Jack Palance for Supporting Actor in City Slickers. The only other time odds weren't even given in an Oscar race for Hilary Swank in Boys Don't Cry. In the memory of most of the movie-going public this was something that just didn't happen. But Hilary Swank pulled something from the depths of her own soul, that's something seen a few times in a life when she played Brandon Teena. For me, Boy's Don't Cry was a cathartic experience that I had never had before watching a film. It was brilliant, but terribly painful. I said at the time I probably would never see the film again, but I did in order to write this commentary. It was just as cathartic as before and even more so after the annual Transgender Day of Remembrance which I participated in my town of Buffalo, New York.Hilary Swank, Chloe Sevigny and the rest of the cast and crew have made an enduring classic. This review is dedicated with reverence to the life of Moses Preston Waller who questioned the package God put his soul in and like Brandon Teena paid for those questions with his life at too young an age.",Boys Don't Cry
1,SnoopyStyle,some great performances,8,27 May 2015,"It's 1993 Lincoln, Nebraska. Female born Brandon Teena (Hilary Swank) dresses as a boy and charms the girls. He gets into trouble constantly. He's not gay. He defends Candance (Alicia Goranson) and befriends John Lotter (Peter Sarsgaard). He starts dating Lana Tisdel (Chloë Sevigny) but as always, he doesn't tell them that he's actually born a girl.Hilary Swank's performance is amazing. I love that her character is so lost while so adamant about her identity. The group dynamic is fascinating. Sarsgaard gets overlooked sometimes but his work is terrific. He is great as this unstable character. The acting from the big three is all terrific in this engaging story.",Boys Don't Cry
2,Hitchcoc,The Sad Thing Is That There Is an Element Out There,9,5 January 2017,"I could never watch this film again. Not because it is a bad movie (I think it is superb), but because I would be subjecting myself to the human pain expressed in it one more time. Hillary Swank, who has proved to be one of our best actresses, plays a young woman, biologically, who sees herself a boy and begins to live that sexual role. We don't know for sure what the future is, but we do know that there are people out there that are willing to kill another person over their sexual preferences. Swank plays a heroic person who tries so hard to embrace what a male would be, even to a dangerous level, that the ugly forces of society can't wait to take her down. There are scenes of the most brutal violence I've seen. The film is masterful in its portrayal. Would that it weren't. Swank's complexity of character is the hallmark of this film.",Boys Don't Cry
3,classicsoncall,"""So you're a boy? Now what?""",8,30 April 2018,"There's no denying Hilary Swank gave a career defining performance in ""Boys Don't Cry"". She handles the conflicted role of a transgendered woman with skillful realism, though I had a hard time accepting that so many folks in her circle would have taken her for a man before the truth eventually came out. More than anything, the picture reveals the utter depravity and violence that exists in certain parts of the country among the unenlightened elements. One doesn't have to necessarily approve of alternative lifestyles to be repelled by folks like John Lotter (Peter Sarsgaard) and his buddy Tom (Brendan Sexton III). I didn't know this movie was based on a true story until the film's end credits stating what happened to the principals. I would bet on a special place in hell for folks with the capacity to hate like those two. The picture is not an easy one to watch, particularly for those faint of heart, especially for the violent rape scene. In terms of a cinematic experience, this is not something one ought to choose for entertainment.",Boys Don't Cry
4,gavin6942,An Unusual Tale of Gender Identity,8,17 June 2010,"Teena Brandon (Hilary Swank) identifies as a boy, so she calls herself Brandon Teena and dresses as a boy. Unfortunately, she also gets in trouble like a boy, so besides the unusual dating situations she/he gets into, the police are on her tail, and others just don't understand.This is a great film, but the most interesting thing about it is how it explores gender roles. The general appearance would suggest that Teena is a lesbian: a woman who likes women. But, that's not really accurate. She's really a man in a woman's body, who happens to like women. As strange as that may sound, it happens.Hilary Swank was, of course, excellent as Brandon Teena. But I also think credit should be given to Chloë Sevigny as Lana Tisdel. Sevigny has time and time again put herself in roles that really push the limit and rarely does she get credit for this.",Boys Don't Cry
5,jboothmillard,Boys Don't Cry,6,7 July 2007,"I recognised the poster, then I watched some of the film in Film Studies class, and I was very interested in seeing the whole thing. Writer/director Kimberley Peirce started this project first with a documentary (or it might have been her short film) based on the true story of a young girl from Nebraska who disguised herself as a man, and was raped and murdered, and then Peirce got the go-ahead to make this independent film. Teena Brandon (then rather unknown, Insomnia and Million Dollar Baby star, Oscar (her first) and Golden Globe winning, and BAFTA nominated Hilary Swank) dressed as a man, mostly to get used to the idea of what it would be like to be one before her operation. She called herself Brandon Teena, and with her new persona made some male friends, including John Lotter (Peter Sarsgaard), Tom Nisson (Brendan Sexton III) and Lonny (Matt McGrath), and some female (the sex was now more attracted to) including Kate (Alison Folland), Candace (Alicia Goranson), and of course, the girl that she would fall in love with Lana Tisdel (Oscar and Golden Globe nominated Chloë Sevigny). The film basically sees Teena/Brandon making a convincing life as a man, getting a girlfriend that after finding out is pretty much okay with it, and the only person that knew before was her brother Brian (Rob Campbell). Soon enough though, the male characters find out her secret and first exploit it to others, then rape her, and in the end it was John that murdered her, maybe accidentally, maybe intentionally for her/his lies. The rape scenes are very disturbing, and the murder is tragic, this is a very convincing performance from Swank as the hero(ine), and a gripping film. Good!",Boys Don't Cry
6,moonspinner55,"Tough-going, truly tragic drama",7,2 June 2002,"Difficult as an entertainment, but certainly worthwhile, this true story about a young woman with a gender-identity issue creeps forward to its preconceived conclusion with the unease of a bad stomach ache; there isn't a pleasant moment in it, but it is remarkable from an actors standpoint. Story of doomed Brandon Teena is retold with care and insight (although the climax was restructured for 'dramatic purposes'), and director Kimberly Pierce examines stifling small-town life in vivid and painful ways. It's not easy to sit through, but its impact stays with one for many days afterward. Hilary Swank gives a bravura, Oscar-winning lead performance; supporting cast is her equal. *** from ****",Boys Don't Cry
7,Quinoa1984,Controversial,7,29 April 2000,"Boys Don't Cry is the controversial tale of a young lady with SIC (sexual identity crisis) who goes as Brandon Teena (though named Teena Brandon) in a small Nebraska town.  Many scenes I liked, but the character of Teena Brandon was not too likable.  I found her to be narcasistic and a not too careful lesbian that led to her demise.  Still, Hilary Swank (in a Oscar winning performance) gives the best she's ever done and succeeds in pulling off her character.  I also liked the supporting characters including Chloe Sevigny, Brendan Sexton III and Peter Skarsgard.  Ok, if It's your liking. B+",Boys Don't Cry
8,michaelRokeefe,Powerful. Eye opening. True life story!,8,5 July 2000,"Director/co-writer Kimberly Peirce puts on the screen a rather frank and sordid love story that ended in a tragic murder in 1993. A young girl in Lincoln, Nebraska leaves her home to try and live out her preferred life style, that as a boy. Suffering a gender identity, Teena Brandon/Brandon Teena lived a short alienated life; but found a soul mate that finally accepted the love of a lonely person.In Teena's mind, she is a young man trapped in a girl's body. After the trans-gender roll playing was discovered, Teena/Brandon was brutally raped and finally shot to death.This movie will not be for everyone. The profanity and violence is relevant to the tragic story. The rape scene is very intense and not easy to watch. The shock of the whole thing is that this is a true story. Sympathy and compassion are part of comprehension. This movie will be hard to forget.Hilary Swank's Oscar winning portrayal of Teena/Brandon is much to talk about. Chloe Sevigny, as the soul mate Lana, is worthy of praise as well. Also in the cast are Peter Sarsgaard, Brendan Sexton III, Jeanetta Arnette and Alicia Goranson.",Boys Don't Cry
9,sunwarrior13,A Powerful And Brilliant Film,10,22 September 2012,"Boys Don't Cry is an independent film that is a dramatization of the real-life story of Brandon Teena, a biologically born female who identified as a man and as intersexed, played by Hilary Swank, who pursues a relationship with a young woman, played by Chloë Sevigny. Aside from Swank and Sevigny,the cast also includes Peter Sarsgaard,Brendan Sexton III,Alicia Goranson,Jeanetta Arnette and Matt McGrath.It was and co-written by Andy Bienen and directed by Kimberly Peirce.Teena Brandon is a woman who chose to live her life as a man and suffered tragic consequences as a result. In 1993, 20-year-old Brandon leaves Lincoln, Nebraska for the nearby community of Falls City, where she sports a crew cut, favors jeans and boots, and is regarded as a man by most of the people in town. While Brandon's friend Lonny warns her that sexual outsiders aren't looked upon kindly in Falls City, she develops a reputation for being something of a ladies' man, and is soon living with a single mother named Candace. But when Brandon meets teenage Lana, the two become romantically involved almost immediately. Brandon makes friends with Lana's mother and a burly ex-con named John. John and his buddy Tom run with a rough group of men who like to drink and carouse, and they accept Brandon as one of their own. However, when Brandon ends up in jail on a traffic violation, her secret comes out, and, while Lana stands by Brandon's side, John and Tom feel betrayed -- and their anger soon boils over into violence.Teena is beaten, raped and murdered by his male acquaintances.Hilary Swank's acclaimed performance pays fitting tribute to the tragic life of Brandon Teena.The picture explores the themes of freedom, courage, identity and empowerment.Also,it is rich love story between two ill-fated lovers and it could be classified as a ""romantic tragedy"" occurring in a working class American setting.Overall,it a powerful and brilliant film.",Boys Don't Cry
10,hitchcockthelegend,You don't seem like you're from around here.,8,21 February 2016,"It's one of those films that any film lover has to see to judge for themselves. A critical darling and an award winner, it's a film of undoubted emotional power. It is based on the tragic case of Teena Brandon (Hilary Swank) who was raped and murdered in 1993, it would become one of the significant cases of hate crime in American history.From the off Kimberly Peirce's film sets out its stall that we are in bleak territory, and so it proves. It dangles little shards of light, but constantly it proves uncompromising and unpleasant. There's a nagging irk that main characters are very thinly drawn, where motives are given short shrift, and this is bizarre given that the pic runs for nearly two hours. However, the performances of both Swank and Chloë Sevigny are outstanding, and Peirce handles the darkest scenes in the movie with a grace and tact that deserves applause. A tale that needed to be told, even in truncated form, Boys Don't Cry is fine cinema making. 8/10",Boys Don't Cry
11,preppy-3,"Strong, unpleasant--SPOILERS",7,1 November 1999,"Graphic and VERY disturbing about a person born with both sexes. The female side is more developed but she/he chooses to live as a man. She falls in love with another woman, people discover her secret and all hell breaks loose. Based on a true story, this movie is very well-acted (especially Swank) and pulls no punches. Unfortunately, that also makes it very disturbing to watch. There's a rape sequence that's almost impossible to sit through, and some people walked out of the theatre I saw it in towards the end when it was clear she was going to be killed. I almost joined them! Still, I recommend it and find it great to see a movie that doesn't hold back. Just brace yourself for some truly horrific violence.",Boys Don't Cry
12,lastliberal,What else is there to say?,9,4 April 2008,"Two-time Oscar winner Hillary Swank WAS Brandon. There just wasn't any doubt about it. She gave one of the most powerful and magnificent performances on the screen. There is no not knowing the pain, the fear, the anguish of someone who is struggling with their sexual identity after seeing this magnificent film.Chloë Sevigny had given many good performances over the years, but her performance here was worth of all the awards that she received. She was caught up in something she didn't understand and gave a tender and moving picture of love.With the job that writer/director Kimberly Peirce did here, there is no doubt that I am going to see Stop-Loss as soon as I can.",Boys Don't Cry
13,Boba_Fett1138,Great performance's but not really that powerful as a movie.,7,25 March 2005,"With all respect but why should we care about a lying little young criminal? That was the biggest problem I had with this movie, I could not care for the main character. Therefor the movie wasn't as powerful to me as people made me believe it would be.Yet ""Boys Don't Cry"" is a good watchable movie thanks to a very believable Hilary Swank. Even though we get to see her fully nude (don't hold your breath fan boys, her nude scene's are most definitely not erotic.), you would still belief it if it was said she was a real boy. Still I think that Chloë Sevigny performance was surprisingly even better.What the character's relationship's with each other are was completely unclear to me. Who's who's brother sister, father, husband, mother or friend is completely unclear to me which made the movie hard to follow for me at times. OK, I should admit that I was a bit tired while watching this movie (Had worked very hard this week), so maybe things will be clearer to me when watching this movie again.Fact remains that the story is not told in the best way. Even though the movie is based on a true story, the ending still comes out of the blue and it isn't really clear 'why' the things at the ending happened.Still the love story in the movie works, as well as the movie it's message; Dare to be yourself. It's just that all of it isn't as powerful as it could had been.Still perfectly recommendable for Swank and Sevigny's performance's.7/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",Boys Don't Cry
14,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,"From watching this, they just might",8,16 July 2010,"I watched this years ago. How many? I couldn't tell you. Well, less than eleven, obviously, if not necessarily by much. I'd say it's in excess of seven. Anyway, I wasn't very old or mature at the time, and yet it gripped me. From start to finish. It hit me like a sledgehammer, and it has not left my memory since. This needed to be made. It is the true story of Brandon Teena, a transgendered youth. A controversial(and important) subject to be sure, hence its low budget and the need for it to be independently produced. How to make it work? Focus on the aspect everyone can relate to. Romance. Love. This is about being yourself, about acceptance, identity and understanding. We are introduced to angry 20-ish guys and girls who don't have many chances of a good future, and it angers and frustrates them. Every character in this is completely credible, psychologically accurate, well-developed and portrayed to perfection. Swank(who can pass for a boy), then new-comer Sevigny(whom we fall in love with along with our lead... and she can sing, too!), Sarsgaard(that man has serious guts to go along with his acting chops), I could go on. Entirely convincing every step of the way. This has an immense energy to it, emulating the ""live fast"" philosophy that the people we follow engage in. It is in part on account of the very loose and dynamic camera-work that also creates atmosphere. This barely slows down. Then there are the dream-like sequences hinting towards a freer existence that the real person wanted to achieve. There is impeccable tension in this, as well. The music is great, all well-chosen songs, many of them country, the rest being rock. There is a lot of disturbing content and strong language, a bit of full female nudity and sexuality, a little bloody and unpleasant violence and disgusting stuff and a brutal rape scene in this, none of it gratuitous. The DVD comes with an informational and interesting commentary track by the director/co-writer, Kimberley Peirce(note that she swears in it), a four-minute featurette(largely promotional, and it contains spoilers), a trailer, a teaser and three TV-spots. I recommend this to everyone who can handle it. 8/10",Boys Don't Cry
15,evanston_dad,Deeply Tragic Story That I'll Probably Never Want to Sit Through Again,8,29 June 2010,"""Boys Don't Cry"" is one tough movie to sit through. It's definitely an accomplished bit of film-making, and it features an astonishing performance by Hilary Swank, but I don't know that it's a movie I'd ever want to watch again.It tells the story of Brandon Teena, a young girl who wanted to be a boy. As she explains it in the movie, she suffered from a birth defect whereby she was accidentally born with female body parts. She lives in rural Nebraska, where homosexuality isn't ever tolerated, let alone a lifestyle as complicated as the one she lives. She's of course viewed as either a monster or an object of ridicule, until the intolerance surrounding her reaches a devastating and tragic conclusion.""Boys Don't Cry"" is the kind of movie that will likely only be seen by those who already sympathize with Brandon Teena, and will never be seen by those the movie is trying to instruct.Grade: A",Boys Don't Cry
16,The_Void,Compelling and thought-provoking drama - a must see!,8,26 April 2005,"I've had ample opportunities to see Boys Don't Cry over my film viewing career, but have always neglected to do so because of the themes of it's story. Simply put, the idea behind this film doesn't interest me much and that is the reason for me not bothering to finally see the film. However, now that I have seen it, I don't know why I waited so long; Boys Don't Cry is an excellent film. As rich in themes and life lessons as it is compelling, the film works on a number of levels and is topped off by a truly excellent cast of young performers that give it their all and help to ensure that Boys Don't Cry is the success that it so richly deserves to be. The film follows the intriguing, and oddly true, story of Brandon Teena, or rather Teena Brandon; a girl who is in the midst of a gender identity crisis and decides to live her life as a boy. After finding a young man and woman in a bar, Brandon quickly finds herself on her way to a small town in Nebraska, where she quickly becomes friends with the locals...all the while harbouring her secret.When it comes to good films that are directed by women, there isn't many to list; but Boys Don't Cry is certainly one that belongs towards the top of that short list. Kimberly Peirce excellently directs the film, and after viewing her past filmography it is evident that Peirce was very dedicated to this story as she produced a short film version of it in 1995. While Peirce's direction stands out, it is certainly not the star of the show, as that accolade falls to the scintillatingly brilliant Hilary Swank. Swank picked up an Oscar for her performance in this movie, and that momentous event represents one of the few times that the Academy has given the award to the right person. The central role of this movie is the sort of role that every performer wants to get as it allows them to really get their teeth into it, and that is certainly what Swank does. The rest of the cast also does well in their roles, with Chloë Sevigny and Peter Sarsgaard being the standouts among them.Every scene in the movie is rich with substance and double meaning, and as we spend the whole movie getting acquainted with the various parties; what happens at it's conclusion is both shocking and heart-breakingly tragic. The way that the film pulls off it's climax is skilfully handled, and it's also detached enough for the audience to make their own mind up about, which beats the sickening thickly laid substance approach that so many films latch onto. The substance emancipates from the girl wanting to be the other sex, but if you look deeper into the film, it is not just this element that lends it substance. The meaning of Boys Don't Cry can be stretched to any and all moments in life when you're not the person you want to be, and the story while tragic and shocking, is ultimately uplifting, which only adds more confusion to the already potent cocktail of emotions that Boys Don't Cry forces you into. If, like I was, you aren't watching this film because it's subject doesn't appeal to you; you should book your ideas up. There is something for everyone in this compelling drama.",Boys Don't Cry
17,namashi_1,A Must Watch!,10,18 August 2010,"Brandon Teena (December 12, 1972 – December 31, 1993) was an American trans man who was raped and murdered in Humboldt, Nebraska in December 1993. Does this wikipedia information attract you to watch 'Boys Don't Cry'? Honestly, some true stories are hard to even listen. And harder to watch them on the Silver-Screen! 'Boys Don't Cry' is an incredible film. Biopics on people who became a topic and remained as such, are easier to make. For example, a Alexander or a Ray don't need an introduction. But a Brandon Teena, his emotions, are tough to explore. Sad, but fact, Teena died at the age of 21 of a brutal murder. Controversy caught the film, many claiming it as a half-hearted attempt.As a film, 'Boys Don't Cry', as mentioned, is an incredible film. Kimberly Peirce & Andy Bienen write a biopic, on a short-lived Trans Man with high volume. People say 'You Know, The Final 30-Minutes are Very Depressing'. I damn-en those comments, because... This isn't an easy film to watch right from the beginning. You need a strong heart to watch this film. It tears you apart, it makes you feel like a loser. In it's intentions, 'Boys Don't Cry' succeeds big time.Hilary Swank as Brandon Teena, is magnificent. The actress who won wide acclaim and numerous awards for her performance here, is actually a under statement. She delivers a performance what an actor only dreams about! It's a Hallmark Performance! Chloë Sevigny as Brandon's girlfriend, Lana, is another topper. She is fantastic. Peter Sarsgaard delivers a bravura performance, as well.On the whole, A Must Watch film! WOW!",Boys Don't Cry
18,Smells_Like_Cheese,A love story of confusion and acceptance,10,5 October 2005,"Hilary Swank won in 2000 the Best Actress Oscar for 1999's ""Boys Don't Cry"". While I think she did an excellent job, I felt the Oscar still should have gone to Annette Benning for ""American Beauty"". But Hilary is awesome as well, this is a close tie for the Oscar.""Boys Don't Cry"" is an excellent movie. I was really moved and touched by the story. It made me cry, I'm a girl it's OK :D, because just being accepted for being different is so hard. I felt so awful for Hilary's character. Bradon and Lela had a beautiful love that was awkward obviously, but it was true.This being a true story scares me a bit. Because we still haven't changed to this day in not accepting other's being a homosexual or wanting a sex change. Maybe this movie can help us realize some mistakes. I think this is a great movie to watch, but it is very graphic and disturbing. It's not for all, but I would recommend it. Hilary, you are a terrific actress, keep it up! 10/10",Boys Don't Cry
19,sddavis63,Powerful And Disturbing If At Times A Bit Unfocused,9,27 August 2011,"There were more than a few times when I wondered what the message was. The subject matter was interesting enough. Teena Brandon (""Brandon"") was a transgendered female who identified as a male and lived as a male in Lincoln, Nebraska. After some difficulties with the law, Brandon finds himself hooked up with a questionable group of friends in a small town in the state. The ""friends"" include a couple of ex-cons, and several young women, one of whom - Lana - Brandon becomes involved with even though she doesn't know about Brandon's sexuality.This is based on a true story. I didn't really know the details of Brandon's life, and so had no idea what the movie was going to contain or what was going to happen. For a good part of its runtime, I was wondering what made the story so significant. It was interesting to see how Brandon approached the question of sexuality and how Brandon lived. It was obvious that Brandon was someone who came from a troubled background; obvious also that Brandon's sexual identity had resulted in rejection from Brandon's own family. Brandon had a troubled life, and in some ways the connection with Lana made sense. She also had a troubled and unhappy home life, and the two did seem able to support one another through their respective difficulties. Even though Lana didn't know about Brandon's sexuality, her acceptance of Brandon as a male must have been a source of some comfort and relief. Hilary Swank won an Oscar for her portrayal of Brandon, and Chloe Sevigny was nominated for her portrayal of Lana. I thought both were excellent in this. The movie eventually becomes quite dark and disturbing, moving from being an account of Brandon's life to the events that led up to Brandon's death. Unable to hide the ""secret"" forever, Brandon's identity is discovered by the thugs John and Tom (Peter Saarsgard and Brendan Sexton III). This becomes quite ugly, and for perhaps the first time in the movie Brandon (who had come across up to this point as a bit manipulative, lying about all manner of things and not just sexuality) becomes a real object of sympathy. John and Tom humiliate Brandon by forcibly removing Brandon's pants and forcing Lana to look to prove to her that Brandon has female parts. Brandon is then driven to an isolated area by John and Tom and brutally assaulted and raped. Eventually, out of fear that Brandon would report them for what they did, Brandon is murdered by John and Tom.Based on what I've read about Brandon/Teena and about the case since seeing this, I'd have to commend those responsible for sticking pretty close to the details of what happened. There doesn't seem to have been a lot of dramatic licence taken. I also appreciated that although in the end one has to be appalled by what happened to Brandon the movie didn't come across as a tribute to Brandon. Brandon was shown with both strengths and weaknesses. Brandon's life was hard - and some of the things that made it hard were the result of Brandon's own choices. Brandon's life wasn't soft-soaped in any way to create a hero. This was a life depicted with warts and all. Having said that, it should be mentioned that the real Lana threatened to take legal action over the use of her real name without permission and because of what she claimed was an inaccurate depiction of her life.For a while if you don't know the background of the true events that inspired it, you do wonder exactly where this is going, what point is trying to be made or what lesson is trying to be taught. Still, it's very interesting from beginning to end, and turns out to be both powerful and disturbing. All in all, it's an excellent piece of work. (9/10)",Boys Don't Cry
20,paul2001sw-1,Somewhere in the middle of America,9,6 June 2003,"Lincoln, Nebraska, is a long way from Memphis, a long way from anywhere, in fact; and as for Falls City, well, ""they hang faggots there.""  There's not much for young men to do but drive around in stolen cars, get drunk and stoned, and raise merry hell; not such a bad life, in fact, compared to that of their womenfolk, who work in dead-end jobs and try to look out for their kids.  This outstanding film tells the horrific true story of Teena Brandon, a girl who found her identity through transgressing into the role of a boy. But its real strength comes from the way it uses the particulars of its story both to capture some fundamental truths about the human condition, and also to perfectly evoke a sense of place.  The white trash communities are depicted, even at their worst, with a complex humanity that defies this simple label; their world both cruel and warm, ghastly yet attractive. Accepted in it as a male, Teena experiences both a thrill and a sense of belonging.  The conveyance of these subtle, confused emotions is aided by the technical excellence of this movie: the performances are universally strong (especially Peter Sarsgaard as the Teena's disturbed nemesis), the scene composition unshowy but haunting, the country rock soundtrack exactly on the ball but never allowed to intrude. Crucially, the film never strays into purience or preaching.  We're left with a simple tale of a mixed-up kid out of his/her depth; but every detail is made to count.Smalltown America is a favourite subject for filmmakers, but this is one the best portraits yet, and certainly the most disturbing.  Think ""American Graffiti"" without the sentiment, or ""Fargo"" without the irony.  Compelling, bleak, and human, this is better than either.",Boys Don't Cry

I can't believe both of them are still alive today. This is so much like the Matthew Shepherd Story with hate crime. It's unfortunately happening everywhere, not just America!Hilary Swank made a great resemble of the real Teena Brandon. She honestly prepared the role that I'm so glad she got an Oscar for her character.

23,Dr_Coulardeau,Bigotry or Fetishism ?,9,18 March 2007,"A very disquieting film that tells a story that seems so unreal that we need to discover, at the very end of it, the fate of the protagonists to believe it is a true story. It is first of all a story about the gender identity of a girl, Teena Brandon, who sees herself as a boy and wants to behave as one, to be one. She manages to go through it all and falls in love with a girl who falls in love with her too, thinking she is a boy. So far so good. But what will happen when her real identity comes out? And that is the drama. The brothers or local boys of the neighborhood of the girl who has fallen in love with Teena Brandon decide to take justice in their own hands. First they teach a lesson to that Teena and rape her ruthlessly. But this ends up in the sheriff's office and that is only the beginning of the end. Then the two boys decide to expedite real justice and they kill Teena along with another girl, and mother, that happens to be there at the wrong moment with her baby. The two culprits will be taken to court, tried, convicted and sentenced. But what can we do with such a tragedy? How can it be possible in our modern world that a gender crisis in the mind of a girl may cause such disorder among the people around her? How come the boys react so violently whereas the girls or even older women seem to be a lot more tolerant? What makes such a gender crisis so dramatic? There is no real answer and simple male bigotry is not enough to explain such events. Is malehood such a privilege, such an unsharable dignity that any woman who will desire to assume some of it for herself will turn the surrounding men into criminals? We are dealing here with sex or gender fetishism. But how come it is stronger among men than among women? Or would it be the same in reverse if a boy tried to assume a female identity? I am not sure. Men must feel particularly menaced by the gender wavering of a female who could thus penetrate the secret citadel of malehood without being a member of the brotherhood. Is it really an old story? Definitely not. It could happen again any time, and I would even say it does happen all the time here or there, openly but probably most of the time unknown of anyone because self-censored by the ""culprit"" of such wavering.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris Dauphine & University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne",Boys Don't Cry

25,freemantle_uk,The tragic life and death of Brandon Teena,8,19 October 2013,"Boys Don't Cry is a brutal, hard hitting drama about the tragic story of Brandon Teena (Hilary Swank), a young woman with gender identity disorder and aims to live her life as a man. With a history of juvenile delinquency and social rejection from a homophobic, ill-informed community Brandon finds acceptance in Fall City, Nebraska, finding friends with a group and even love with Lana Tisdel (Chloe Sevigny). But when Brandon's secret is discovery it leads to rejection, violence, rape and murder.Boys Don't Cry is an extremely well acted, well directed film, particularly from Swank and Sevigny who had very tough roles. Director Kimberly Peirce gives Boys Don't Cry a very tight, claustrophobic feel with her close direction in small settings and she does not shy away with the brutality when showing the violence and the horrific rape scene.Boys Don't Cry is a very raw, powerful film and a fine example of American independent filmmaking as we get a film about acceptance, love and prejudice.",Boys Don't Cry
26,dfranzen70,Trans-gender-bender,5,12 June 2000,"Well, they might not cry, but they sure get themselves in a whole mess of trouble. Especially if they're not sure they want to be a boy. Brandon (Hillary Swank) has a sexual identity problem. She's female, but she desperately wants to be a male. She cuts her hair short and picks up women in honkytonk bars in Lincoln, Nebraska as a way of dealing with her emotional problems. Of course, this sets her up for endless persecution by local rednecks (this movie does nothing to eliminate standard hillbilly/small-town stereotypes), and poor Brandon Teena (or Teena Brandon, her real name) suffers tremendous mental and physical anguish at the hands of those less understanding.Brandon's travails take her to Falls City, where she meets Lana (Chloe Sevigny, late of Kids) and Candace (Alicia Goranson). Brandon hangs out with her new friends, who also include Tom (Brendan Sexton III) and John (Peter Sarsgaard). They drink, they party, they try to outrun the cops in a mid-70's Nova, and pretty much play the roles of Young People Gone Bad. How much you like these characters might depend on how much you identify with them - picture the gang from The Outsiders, for example. There's not much original in these amoral, hell-raising characters; they paint a pretty ugly picture of small-town people. Think your family has problems? Just about every vice and bad character trait is evident in these people, probably doing more to lower outsiders' opinions of rural America than any in any film in recent memory.Needless to say, Brandon doesn't tell anyone she's female right away, which means that in true Hollywood fashion, those very same people who she's come to know and trust - and yes, even love - aren't going to be as trusting when they find out she's female, rather than male. Haven't we seen that a few times before? She can't very well tell anyone right from the start, because then she runs the risk of their ridicule before they get a chance to know her. Ah, but this is a movie, even if it IS based on fact. So when she DOES have to tell them she's a girl, of course most of them react rather negatively. And because this is a stereotypical small town, they react violently, too. I think I saw this before, when the movie was called Frankenstein.Some of the persecution Brandon undergoes is a bit overdone, too - did we REALLY need a protracted, graphic rape scene? I realize that sometimes the audience needs to be shocked in order to be convinced of the character's appeal, but this scene occurred rather late in the film, and by then the audience really should be on the lead character's side.And that brings up another little issue - the motivation of Brandon. I do understand that this is a person (based on a real-life person, too) who is completely at odds with herself - she has the female parts, but longs to be male - and that conflict causes her to seek pleasure and pain simply to survive. But most of her problems in this film are brought on by her own actions. It's not as if Brandon is simply trying to fit in with the rest of the world - she actually pushes the envelope, almost challenging herself to survive, trying to see how far she can go before someone finds out. This isn't a story of someone with  a troubled past simply wanting to move on; this is a story of someone who's a little different than everyone else, and wants to challenge herself, who almost dares others to discover her secret.
Don't misunderstand me - this is a fine film, but it has its bad points, too. The first three-quarters of the film are riveting, although sometimes tough to watch. But the last quarter descends into a standard movie-of-the-week treatment of a pretty serious subject, and generally every character becomes a caricature. I watched countless stereotypes and cliches walk across my screen during that last quarter. It's almost as if the screenwriters took an extended coffee break and someone from USA Networks filled in.Another problem is the casting. Hilary Swank turns in some magnificent work (and really deserved her Oscar), but her casting was puzzling, at least from a physical standpoint. When she cuts her hair short in her guy-disguise, that's about as male as she looks. For the bulk of the movie - in full guy-mode - she basically looks like someone's underfed sister. She's skinny and with a gigantic mouth. (And I saw her at the Oscars in female-mode - she's really VERY attractive.) To me, she really didn't look all that male - she just looked young. Now, I'm not sure what else the makers of this movie could have done to make Swank look more masculine, and of course this is based on a true story. Certainly, given the physical limitations of the role, Swank did a remarkable job.All in all, it's a good movie, thought-provoking at times. It's just a shame so many white-trash stereotypes had to be thrown in there as well!",Boys Don't Cry
27,meeza,POWERFUL WITH GREAT ACTING!,8,28 February 2000,"You will not see a more traumatic film this year than ""Boys Don't Cry."" The film is based on a true story about a young girl named Teena Brandon who disguises herself as a boy named Brandon Teena and ventures into an unfamiliar rural small town. There she befriends several young drunken-happy rebels and falls for one of them. Hilary Swank's unbelievable performance as Teena/Brandon will make any boy or girl cry. I project this girl crying when she picks up her Best Actress golden boy. Chloe Sevigny's supporting role as the small town no-lifer who falls for Brandon was stupendous. Peter Sarsgaard was amazing as the drunken rebel who first befriends Brandon and then rapes and kills Teena. Director Kimberly Pierce, along with ""Being John Malkovich"" director Spike Jonze, definitely deserve the rookie-of-the-year auteur distinctions. This film is not for the weak-hearted because of its poignant and traumatic rape and murder scenes during the film's last overture.

28,FilmCriticLalitRao,A film about sexual identity crisis is not for all tastes.,7,16 September 2009,"The most singular truth about ""Boys Don't Cry"" is that it is not at all an ordinary run of the mill entertainment film masquerading as an amusingly adventurous biopic about a hapless victim of hate crime. This is hardly no mean achievement for a low budget independent film which went on to become a tremendously huge commercial as well as critical success.Viewers and critics can do justice to this film by ascertaining what it meant to them and how continues to change their perception of alternative sexual preference.It has been repeatedly stated in media that ""Boys Don't Cry"" is a film about hate crime but not enough information is given to enable viewers to have an idea of what exactly causes such a gruesome crime to happen.This is something which can be considered as a weak spot in the overall narrative trajectory.It is true that this film is an absorbing biopic about a person who faces issues related to sexual identity crisis but the film loses its charm when it starts to focus more on its sundry characters. It would be blasphemous to compare ""Boys Don't Cry"" with ""In Cold Blood"" as Richard Brooks' film laid ample stress on criminals' psychological as well as emotional framework.This is not exactly the case with ""Boys Don't Cry"" as it appears mostly as a film depicting dreary existence of low lives in small,sleepy,obscure American towns.Boys Don't Cry would always be remembered as a truly phenomenal film which has been able to garner wider acclaim thanks to peerless collaboration between filmmaker Kimberly Peirce and leading lady Hillary Swank.",Boys Don't Cry
29,MaxBorg89,"Audacious, painful and heartbreaking.",10,26 April 2006,"This film could be easily dismissed, given its subject, as a ""lesbian love story"" or, as some called it, a ""chick-with-a-d*ck-flick"" (actually, that's what they said of Transamerica, but in a way it works for this one, too). Those definitions are disrespectful and very reductive. Boys Don't Cry is one of the most gripping and brutal dramas ever made, and it stands the test of time thanks to its audacity and its brilliant central performance, courtesy of the heartbreaking Hilary Swank.Swank stars as Teena Brandon, a 20-year old girl from Lincoln, Nebraska, who's right in the middle of a ""sexual identity crisis"" (her own words). This crisis causes her some trouble with the law, and she decides to run away, more specifically to Falls City. Once there, she starts a new life, with a new name (Brandon Teen), a new haircut and socks down her pants. It's under these circumstances that she meets Lana (Chloe Sevigny), who will begin a passionate relationship with Brandon, unaware of ""his"" real nature. But what's gonna happen when the truth leaks out?On the surface, Boys Don't Cry could sound like a simple ""lesbian flick"", but that would be like saying American History X is just about skinheads. True, this film is about love, but it's also a careful, unflinching study of identity, hope and fear. The last one plays a significant part in the third act, as some of the characters' (most notably John, cunningly played by Peter Sarsgaard) fear of something they don't understand will have tragic consequences.Director Kimberly Peirce tells this painful true story without judging anyone, so that the performances can speak for themselves: Swank is staggering in a role rivaled only by her equally tear-inducing turn in Million Dollar Baby (she deservedly won an Oscar for both performances). She makes Brandon appear like a human being, not a freak, and that makes her story even more uncomfortable to watch in certain parts. The supporting players excel as well, Sevigny (who was Oscar-nominated for the role of Lana) and Sarsgaard delivering the first of many riveting contributions to independent cinema.Consistently moving, occasionally hard to watch (there's a rape scene which might upset the weak of stomach), Boys Don't Cry is a daring, powerful effort that demands to be seen. And despite its title, it's very likely to make all audiences shed a tear, no matter the gender or inclination. This is a movie that won't leave you indifferent.",Boys Don't Cry
30,jimbo-53-186511,"A compelling, interesting and often powerful film - it hits more than it misses",7,4 November 2017,"Teena Brandon (Hilary Swank) is a young woman who refuses to accept that she's a woman and uses the male alias of Brandon Teena. Teena dresses like a man, has her hair cut short and uses various 'accessories' to make her look like a man. Teena finds love when she meets Lana Tisdel (Chloe Sevigny) who is unaware that Teena is really a woman. Things come to a head and take a dangerous turn when Lana's friends and family discover Teena's secret...I've heard stories about woman and men whom have a sexually identity crisis; a man feeling as though they are trapped inside a woman's body and vice versa, but it's not really a subject that I know a great deal about it (and I suspect that it's something that most people will neither understand nor be able to relate to). This is clearly what Teena suffered from and being seen as a guy and hanging out with the guys made her happy and in her own mind she saw this as living a normal existence.Perhaps that's part of the reason that I found it interesting; the fact that I know so little about it and the film does give some insight into how this type of disorder affects the individual. This part of the story resonated with me because I did think to myself that it must be genuinely awful for those people that live their lives feeling as though they are trapped in the wrong body; of course there is gender reassignment as an option, but that's quite a big step to take and presumably it doesn't come cheap either so for most individuals the only viable option will be to pretend like Teena Brandon.Like a lot of biopics, Boys Don't Cry does play loose with some of the facts; for example in the film it shows that Lana and Teena's relationship continued after Lana discovers Teena's secret, but in actuality this didn't happen - allegedly the real Tisdel sued the filmmakers for misrepresentation. This revelation confirmed some of my suspicions about the film being a bit phony as I felt that Lana's reaction to Teena's discovery didn't reflect the way that a normal person would react to quite a major shocking discovery. In some ways I can understand why the filmmakers chose to show Lana and Teena in a relationship throughout the film; it keeps the audience more involved in the story and also makes the powerful and brutal ending more emotional - at least it did for me as I found myself emotionally involved in the story.One other thing I found puzzling is that Lana never challenged Teena about her being a compulsive liar - yes some of it was necessary in order for her to keep her secret, but some of her lies were delusional grandeur and it made me wonder why someone would trust and want to be with someone whom they know to be a compulsive liar? Having said all that, I can't deny that this was a pretty involving film about a subject that many people won't understand or be able to relate to.However, despite the fact that it plays loose with some of the facts it does enough to open our eyes on what it's like for an individual suffering from a gender identity crisis. It won't be for everyone, but I thought that it was a pretty good film.",Boys Don't Cry

And it does pander to that curiosity. But it gets beyond that to quite vividly show that relationships are about sharing, caring and intimacy, regardless of physical how-to's, making sexual identity confusion more sympathetic than the usual treatment of transsexuals in film, including ""The Adventures of Priscilla,"" or maybe it's just because the gender is different. Or maybe it's Hilary Swank's amazing performance.There is a frightening sense of isolation surrounding these trailer-park trash characters--not just the very confused central character, Teena Brandon/Brandon Teena, but all these screwed-up, very drunken, very bored folks in very small Texas towns, such that one very much fears for their progeny. I thought it looked like alcoholism is a bigger problem than homophobia and threats to sexual identity such that you are made sympathetic to the desperate lives of all of them where they seem to only have sex and violence as outlets. Reminded me of a line in the Hal Ketchum song to the effect that the world must be flat because everyone who leaves never comes back.Brendon Sexton III is once again playing a threatening character, like in ""Welcome to the Dollhouse,"" but he was unrecognizable at first in curls and scraggly beard as the follower not the initiator.

Well, if I'm wrong, I don't mind telling you that too and this time I was wrong.""Boys Don't Cry"" was actually a good movie with a disturbing, but also interesting subject.

At first everything seems to go perfectly, but than his new friends find out his true identity, thanks to a letter from the police.

Not only has she been courageous enough to play a role like that (I'm sure that many conservative Americans will have a lot of difficulties with this role), she also played it very convincingly. The other actors did a good job as well of course, but her performance stood out in my opinion.

It's strange to me to think that all the actresses in this film auditioned for the role of Teena,specially Chloë Sevigny, who plays Lana, that is so feminine. Anyway... this story is very beautiful and touching, but I personally don't see how someone can think Teena was guy, or how Lana didn't figure out that she was a girl while they were going out.The film has also been criticized for, erasing the real-life character of Phillip DeVine, a disabled black man who was friends with Brandon, and who was killed by John Lotter and Marvin Nissen in the same incident.",Boys Don't Cry
38,tomsview,A boy too many,8,4 September 2013,"""Boys Don't Cry"" is a powerful experience. So is root canal therapy. Although the film cannot be considered entertainment, it is a compelling document that makes the point that being different can get one into a lot of trouble.Set in Nebraska, the movie takes place in bars, trailer parks and rural locations, which may possess rustic charm in other films, but in this one are just depressing. However, the locale is secondary to the film's universal themes of prejudice and the search for identity.The story is based on real events. Teena Brandon (Hilary Swank), is a woman who prefers to live as a man – Brandon Teena. He has already commenced the hormone treatments that will help him achieve the change physically. There is little doubt that if he had pursued this gender choice in a large city, he probably wouldn't have attracted undue attention. However, he rejected this course, refusing easy classification. Brandon is referred to as him in nearly all the serious reports of the case. It is as though the media has accorded him the dignity and acceptance that was denied him while he lived. Brandon chose to try and lead the life of a man in a small, semi-rural environment where anonymity was almost impossible. He was attracted to a group of people who were fringe-dwellers with petty crime and anti-social behaviour almost a given. Befriended by John Lotter and Tom Nissen played by Peter Sarsgaard and Brendan Sexton III, he comes to know three women associated with them, an ex-girlfriend named Lana played by Chloë Sevigny, her mother, and another friend Candace, who features in the film's tragic ending. All accept Brandon as a boy, albeit a pretty and slightly built one. Brandon and Lana begin an affair. At first Lana doesn't realise Brandon's true physiology but as time goes on, seems to accept the situation. The affair creates tension among the others, especially John, who is jealous of Lana's attention to Brandon.The discovery by John and Tom that Brandon is still physically a girl leads to ugly events. The final scenes of this film are brutal and haunting. Hilary Swank won the academy award for best actress. It is a searing portrayal that blew away all the other contenders that year. One must feel sorry for those other actors who came up against this tour de force of a performance. Swank lived as a man for a month to prepare for the part. With chest taped and a sock in her jeans, the transformation is startling. The two boys, John and Tom, swagger, brawl and drink in a reckless way that is disturbingly real. Their dysfunctional personalities are painfully revealed. Despite the fact that John and Tom break the law whenever they can get away with it, they are in fact rigid conformists, shaped by an environment that has little tolerance of difference and none at all for gender conflict. The danger they generate is palpable, and it is into this environment that Brandon walks with a degree of innocence. The film is unique in subject matter. It is a disturbing work on every level. Even after another Academy Award, it still marks a career highlight for Hilary Swank, and for Kimberly Peirce, the woman whose creative drive brought it to fruition. Between them, they have created a work that is more of an experience than a film.",Boys Don't Cry
39,DeeNine-2,Sometimes they do,9,17 September 2001,"(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book ""Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!"" Get it at Amazon.)This movie really made me think about sexual differences and what it means to have a sex change or to want one, or to be trapped in a gender you don't want. It was very effective to have us see Hilary Swank (who plays Brandon Teena/Teena Brandon) with short hair and male facial expressions and gestures without giving us a glimpse of her as Teena. (Actually we did get a brief glimpse in a photo.) Swank looks like a boy, acts like a boy, in fact works hard to be a boy; indeed that is (sadly) part of what this movie is about, what it means to be a boy in middle America as opposed to being a girl. And then when we have the scene with the tampons and the breast wrapping and we see her legs, the effect is startling, an effect possibly lost on those who knew that the person playing Brandon was a woman. It was when I saw her legs and could tell at a glance that she was a woman with a woman's legs that I realized just how subtle, but unmistakable are the anatomical sexual differences, and how convincing Swank's portrayal was.I was reminded as I watched this of being a young person, of being a teenager and going through all the rituals and rites, unspoken, unplanned, without social sanction, that we all go through to prove our identity, because that is what Brandon was so eager to do, to prove his identity as a boy. I thought, ah such an advantage he has with the girls because he knows what they like and what they want. He can be smooth, and how pretty he looks. It was strange. I actually knew some guys in my youth who had such talent, and the girls did love them.The direction by Kimberly Peirce is nicely paced and the forebodings of horror to come are sprinkled lightly throughout so that we don't really think about the resolution perhaps until the campfire scene in which John Lotter shows his self-inflicted scars and tosses the knife to Brandon. Then we know for sure, something bad is going to happen.Hilary Swank is very convincing. Her performance is stunning, and she deserved the Academy Award she won for Best Actress. She is the type of tomboy/girl so beloved of the French cinema, tomboyish, but obvious a girl like, for example, Zouzou as seen in Chloe in the Afternoon (1972) or Élodie Bouchez in the The Dreamlife of Angels (1998), or many others. Indeed, one is even reminded of Juliette Binoche, who of course can play anything, or going way back, Leslie Caron in Gigi (1958). Chloe Signvey, who plays Lana Tisdel, the girl Brandon loves, whom I first saw in Palmetto (1998), where she stole a scene or two from Woody Allen and Elisabeth Shue, really comes off ironically as butch to Swank, yet manages a sexy, blue collar girl next door femininity. She also does a great job. Peter Sarsgaard is perfect as John Lotter, trailer trash car thief and homophobic redneck degenerate.Very disturbing is the ending. If you know the story, you know the ending. Just how true this was to the real life story it is based on is really irrelevant. I knew nothing about the story, but I know that film makers always take license to tell it the way they think it will play best, and so it's best to just experience the film as the film, independent of the real story, which, like all real stories, can never be totally told.Obviously this is not for the kiddies and comes as close to an ""X"" rating as any ""R"" movie you'll ever see. It will make most viewers uncomfortable, but it is the kind of story that needs to be told.",Boys Don't Cry
40,sme_no_densetsu,A daring film with a couple of fine performances,8,7 June 2008,"""Boys Don't Cry"" should get points for being daring, if nothing else. It doesn't shy away from its subject matter, it confronts it head on.The story concerns a young transsexual (Hilary Swank) who strikes up a relationship with a young woman (Chloë Sevigny) who isn't aware of his/her condition. Brushes with the law and homophobic would-be friends soon threaten to bring the relationship to a tragic end.The acting in the film is not that great, with two exceptions. Swank's performance was justly rewarded by an Oscar while Sevigny earned an Oscar nomination. This was Swank's breakthrough as she shone in a very challenging role. Her chemistry with Sevigny is evident in the scenes they share, including some of an intimate nature.The direction by Kimberly Pierce is well done throughout and was a surprise since the name was completely unfamiliar to me. The soundtrack, on the other hand, is hit and miss with a few excellent choices alongside some regrettable ones.One possible drawback for this film is that it's based on a true story so if, like me, you're already familiar with the story then you know how it ends. Nevertheless, it should keep you interested, if only to behold the fine performances from Swank and Sevigny.",Boys Don't Cry
41,Howlin Wolf,I didn't feel as much sympathy as I should have...,7,29 March 2005,"... because we're never afforded the opportunity to get inside Brandon-Teena's head. There's no measured build-up to show the beginnings of a life in torment, we're just thrown in at the deep end of the problems and asked to care. We see the physical scars, sure, but by and large the mental adjustment seems already to have taken place. Brandon is comfortable enough in a man's skin to be able to assimilate without question and form near-enough instant bonds. It's only when she is rumbled that the uncomfortable circumstances start to dominate. How can I sympathise fully, when the psychology of this person is just as 'distant' as that of some random man or woman on the street?",Boys Don't Cry
42,Screen_Blitz,"Powerful, moving, and thought-provoking tale",8,6 December 2015,"This movie directed by Kimberly Peirce, dramatizes the tragic events that took place in December 1993 in Lincoln, Nebraska and made news headlines around the nation. This film follows 21-year old girl named Teena Brandon (played by Hilary Swank) who lives with her cousin Lonny (played by Matt McGrath) in Lincoln, Nebraska. Sporting a short hairstyle, platted shirt, jeans, and some boots, Teena adopts a male identity and goes under the 'Brandon Teena'. He begins living his life as a boy and travels to a small of Falls City, Nebraska where he attempts to true love and falls in love with beautiful girl named Lana Tisdel (played by Chloe Sevigny). Making an effort to keep his true gender a secret, Brandon ventures his nights through drinking, sex, and street racing with Lana and her friends Candice (played by Alicia Goranson), John Lotter (played by Peter Sarsgard), and Tom Nissen (played by Brenden Sexton). However, when everyone soon discovers he is hiding his true gender, his life makes a turn for the worse and his relationship with Lana is deeply put to the test. The title of the film is taken from 'Boys Don't Cry"" by the rock band The Cure.This film tackles on some heavy subject matter about transgender and the story is very thought-provoking enough for viewers raise questions dealing with the subject matter, especially since this is based on events that happened in real life. Director Kimberly Peirce and the writers with the story as well as the characters very genuine and maturely, and I think it pays a good tribute to the real-life story of Teena Brandon. The characters are beautifully written, the main character Brandon Teena (or Teena Brandon) in particular, and the story really comes to life by an amazing, if not excellent script. Hilary Swank's performance is nothing short of fantastic, she really brings such light to her role and viewers can tell that she is really committed to the role. The fact that she won an Oscar for her performance is no surprise. The rest of cast did quite a credible job as well. Then the story moves pretty good throughout its the film's run and manages to stay intriguing for the most time. The first half of the film is very light-hearted and soft-spoken, then the second half gets quite powerful and upsetting in tone. As the themes of the film are heavy, there are some scenes that get quite poignant and aggressively uncomfortable to watch, especially for viewers who have dealt with similar situations. But overall, this film really honest and grounded in a way where viewers are able to connect with the characters and the story. The only real flaw with the film is that it fails to explain the reason behind the Brandon's transgender or her background that gives hints as to why she adopted a male identity to begin with.Boys Don't Cry is a powerful and thought-provoking. The performances are amazing and the writing is quite awe-inspiring. This is a film that is important to watch, but something I would only recommend to mature viewers due to the intense subject matter and tone that not all viewers could handle too easy.",Boys Don't Cry

Sometimes, most often, these journeys are pretty ordinary, small peaks and troughs balance our contentment. If you're really lucky you'll find a way to squeeze a bit more happiness out than others but there are always risks that you end up with a bit more sorrow sucked in instead. On this occasion, Hilary Swank magnificently reveals the extreme consequences that can result when the choices you make about who you want to be, and who you are, deliver you into circumstances that have a considerably deeper impact than you could ever have anticipated. With a great supporting cast, a story of hate and prejudice that still echoes as loud as ever around the world today, sadly - and one that doesn't look like changing too soon either.",Boys Don't Cry

45,CharltonBoy,A Good performance from Hilary Swank,7,14 May 2002,"Having seen reviews and ratings from different sources I was looking forward to a brilliant film and although good this did disappoint me a little. Don't get me wrong the acting is great and the story is different from anything I have seen before but it did lack a certain something that I can't quite put my finger on. I think deep down we wanted to (or needed) to see Branden as a girl so we could really appreciate the lengths the young girl went to to disguise herself as a boy, maybe if we had seen her at the begining that would have made all the difference.Nevertheless this film is good and very thought provoking without being moving at any stage.Hilary Swank deserves a great deal of credit for her performance because it could not have been easy ,she does look and sound remarkably like a young boy. Some of the scenes she is involved in must had been difficult to shoot and for her performance alone this film is worth seeing. 7 out of 10.",Boys Don't Cry

47,KnightsofNi11,Brutally real,8,25 July 2012,"In 1993 a story about a transgendered teen named Teena Brandon found its way into the news. The 1999 film Boys Don't Cry is the dramatization of Teena's story. Hilary Swank plays Teena/Brandon, the transgender person who prefers living as a man, despite the fact she was born biologically female. Her story takes place in and around Lincoln, Nebraska, a very rural area where locals don't take too kindly to something so foreign to them like transgender people. Teena/Brandon knows this so she hides the fact she is female while running around causing trouble with a group of alcoholic ruffians. But when she falls in love for Lana, one of the people she stays with outside of Lincoln, things get very complicated and the story darkens quite a bit in this brutally honest and disturbingly real film that is hauntingly sick from start to finish.You have to go into Boys Don't Cry prepared for a lot of drama, a lot of emotion, and a lot of brutality that will both shock and disgust you. This is a vulgar, disturbing, and obscene film that will haunt your dreams and make you look at the world in a whole new way. Of course, the vulgarity and obscenity I'm referring to has nothing to do with the protagonists sexuality. What is so shocking and so disturbing about this film is how our protagonist must live her life and the disgusting bigotry and hatred she must face. It's such a harrowing experience, one that we rarely see translated to film in such a brutally realistic way. Boys Don't Cry captures a dark and troubled part of real life that so many of us are sheltered from. It opens our eyes and our minds to what all is out there and it shows us just how different this world can be and the horrible ways in which people will do all they can to fight off change and difference that we all experience.Boys Don't Cry is not a film you will walk away from thinking, ""Boy, that was a great film,"" or, ""Gee, I really enjoyed that."" No. It is a film you will walk away from shocked and appalled. It's not a film you simply look at as just a good film. It's a violent slap in the face from reality. It's a film that, rather than transport you from the real world, throws you into it's dark crevices and makes you experience the kind of horrors that really are out there. It's a sobering experience that will surely make you think, and will challenge you to open your eyes to the different kinds of people that do exist in this world. Boys Don't Cry is a very difficult film but, if you can handle it, you really have to see it. It's a cinematic experience like no other, and it will throw new and somewhat frightening ideas into your mind. This is quite the film.",Boys Don't Cry

While the Tennessee locale has been changed to Nebraska, its basic purpose seems the same:  exploiting the facts to graphically depict humiliation, rape and murder.

Unfortunately it's an extremely sad and brutal story of what happened.

50,Isaac5855,A disturbing and unsettling drama anchored by one of the most richly deserved Oscar winning performances ever....,8,29 March 2007,"BOYS DON'T CRY was an unsettling, uncomfortable but ultimately rewarding film experience that gnaws away at you long after the credits roll. The film is based on the life of Teena Brandon, a woman who felt she was man trapped in a woman's body and attempted to live her life as a man. Hillary Swank won her first Oscar for Best Actress in a Leading Role for her powerhouse performance as Teena, who changed her name to Brandon Teena and attempted to live her life as a man. This film has little to do with homosexuality. As a matter of fact, early on in the film, when her best friend refers to her as a lesbian, she blows a gasket. This encounter, coupled with problems with the law, force Brandon on the road to a new life where he meets a shy young factory worker, played by Chloe Sevigny, and begins a romance with her, which is complicated by her friend (Peter Sarsgaard)whose constant challenging of Brandon in Sevigny's life leads to an inevitable and tragic showdown. The performances by Swank, Sarsgaard, and Sevigny (also nominated for Best Supporting Actress) are nothing short of mesmerizing. A truly adult motion picture experience, this film features some uncompromising violence and a very graphic rape scene. Once you have the children safely tucked in bed and if you have the stomach for it, treat yourself to what was probably the most powerful film to be released in 1999. You've never seen anything like this and never will again.",Boys Don't Cry

52,Movie-12,"The main character is never felt or realized, but the performances save the movie. *** (out of four)",7,24 February 2001,"BOYS DON'T CRY / (1999) *** (out of four)By Blake French:(""Boys Don't Cry"" is based on a true story. In this review a few actual facts are revealed. Some readers may believe the information to be spoilers.)Hilary Swank is an remarkably talented actress, too good for the material in ""Boys Don't Cry,"" the new drama based on the true story of young Nebraska woman Teena Brandon, who was raped and killed after experimenting with her sexual identity. Swank and a immovable supporting cast, together with Chloe Sevigny, Peter Sarsgaard, and Brendan Sexton III, grant success for Kimberly Peirce's heartbreaking, although mislead, depiction of vivid events. The acting saves the movie and the Academy Awards recognized several of the better performances (Swank even won Best  Actress). What the movie does not do is understand the true depths and emotions involved with the main character's intentions.Teena Brandon (Swank) becomes confused about her sexual identity and therefore cuts her hair short, stuffs her pants, flattens her chest, and exchanges her name for Brandon Teena. (We will use ""he"" when referring to Brandon Teena). Brandon travels to Falls City to clear her mind of an awaiting court date for grand auto theft. There he notices a townie girl named Candace (Alicia Goranson), whose ex-con buddy, John (Peter Sarsgaard), befriends Brandon. His other companions, including Tom (Brendan Sexton III), Kate (Alison Folland), and Lana (Chloe Sevigny), welcome this new ""pretty boy"" as one of their own.Romantic sparkles fly between Lana and Brandon, arousing John's jealousy. Soon their relationship becomes sexual, and the closer the two become, the more cautious Brandon must be in keeping his actual identity a secret. The other's begin to suspect something suspicious when they find tampons and a dildo under his mattress. When they eventually learn of his gender, John and Tom brutally rape Brandon. When the police do not take charge of the criminals, a few days later Teena is slayed by the two.
The posters of ""Boys Don't Cry"" reveal a peculiar tagline: ""A true story about finding the courage to be yourself."" Understood the movie flows understandably and clearly and the style is disturbing and vivid, Kimberly Peirce directed with a perverse and edgy mood. But the movie lacks an extremely important element: the defining of Brandon Teena's mental status. Even if we simply accept the notions of Teena wanting to be a boy, we want to know why. Is this young woman a lesbian? A transvestite? A hermaphrodite? Are her intentions aimed towards identity or homosexuality? Is she actually a lesbian who wants to be normal--therefore a sex change is necessary? None of our questions are answered dealing with Teena's intent, and the entire movie is based on those vary feelings.I previously reviewed this film negatively; the filmmaker's failed to develop ideas, but it is now that I realize the actors are really what it is all about. It was up to Swank to portray a confused character, and she did a great job with the slim material provided. As I said earlier, the actual production is unworthy of such great performances, but thanks to the terrific actors, ""Boys Don't Cry"" comes off as a satisfactorily passionate piece of work. That is more than the majority of movies these days.",Boys Don't Cry
53,alice liddell,Epiphany versus reality.,5,6 June 2000,"Kimberley Peirce seems to want to mirror the effect Brandon Teena has on a sexually ultraconformist society in her film's form.  So that society is represented by the dominating 'true story' narrative, predictable, linear, conventional; while Brandon is figured in the epiphanical moments that suspend narrative, time, place - Van Sant-like infusions of pure colour, grace and magic.  As in real life, the former swamps the latter, and both thoroughly depress the viewer.  You expect an American film to evade social criticism, but the lack of a sense of landscape is surprising.",Boys Don't Cry
54,FlickJunkie-2,Disturbing and powerful film,9,6 May 2000,"This is a poignant and powerful film.  It is the true story of Teena Brandon, a young woman who is in the throes of a sexual identity crisis. She cuts her hair and dresses like a man to see if she can pass for one. What starts out as an experiment turns into a full fledged alter ego as she is accepted as a man by a group she meets in a bar.  The story follows the group's escapades, including Brandon's love affair with Lana, who falls in love with Brandon, thinking she's a man.  It culminates with the discovery that Brandon is actually a woman with a dramatic confrontation in the finale.This is film noir at it's finest.  A lot of people think that this is a story about courage and lesbianism but it is really about neither.  It is about the search for identity; not just sexual identity but the search for a deeper self .  All the characters in this film were lost and confused, but Brandon was the only one who realized it of herself.  The rest were basically playing out their despondent lives trying not to think of who or what they were.  Here was a person they loved and accepted, but who turned out to be the most heinous of deviants as defined by their own prejudices and fears. This is why they were so fundamentally shaken upon the revelation of Brandon's true identity.  It left them to confront their own flimsy identities.  They were left with no respite from the emotional vortex. Brandon presented a terrifying threat to the way they viewed themselves. They were compelled to change who they were or hate someone they had grown to love.This film was also about obsession.  Brandon takes extraordinary risks to live the male role, not out of courage, but out of an obsession to know and understand it, and to see if she can find comfort and a sense of belonging. Likewise, writer/director Kimberly Peirce had been obsessed with this story and researched it for five years before finally making the film.  Obsession generally leads to one of two places: greatness or death.  For Peirce, at least for the moment, it has lead to greatness in the production of this film.Strictly from a technical directorial standpoint there was nothing special here.  The lighting was amateurish, the shots were mostly mundane. The sets and locations were realistically trashy, but it is a lot easier to create realistic trash than realistic elegance.  Peirce also bogs the film down occasionally with excessive character development.  However, Peirce captures in the story and the filming, the essence of rural lower class crudenes, bigotry and hatred and fear.  It is the raw emotion that reaches out and grabs us.  Her lens brought into sharp focus the base reality of inescapable despair and deluded hope.  Reality often has fangs, and Peirce was undaunted in showing them and then ripping us to shreds.As to Hilary Swank, I can only add one more rose to the bouquet of praise that has been heaped on her.  If there was any courage in this story, it was the courage of Swank to take such a complex and disturbing role.  The subtlety of her performance was astounding.  She needed not just to be a woman playing a man.  She needed to be a woman playing a woman playing a man, trying to look convincing yet insecure and unsure of how she was being perceived by the other characters.  When in character, her many skillful lapses into moments of femininity, only to snap back into masculinity were masterfully done.  For Swank, this was a meteoric rise from obscurity.  It remains to be seen if it was just the perfect alignment of actor and role, or something more.  I hope for the latter and look forward to seeing her next project.Greatly obscured by Swankmania, was the performance by Chloe Sevigny as Lana, Brandon's love interest.  She gave an outstanding performance in another extraordinarily difficult role.  Her conflict over the implications of her sexual and emotional feelings for Brandon were sensitively and delicately portrayed.  She played the part with a tentative eagerness, just as one would expect of someone whose sexual identity had been thrown into upheaval.  It was also no easy career choice to be cast in a role with so many explicit sexual scenes with another woman.This film was stark reality with no holds barred.  The filmmaking was technically unsophisticated (and I'm usually a real stickler about that), but I rated it a 9/10 on pure emotional power.  This film is not for you if you are offended by lesbianism, graphic violence or profanity.  But if you are not intimidated by the naked reality of the darker side of life, this is a film you must experience.",Boys Don't Cry
55,sashank_kini-1,Powerful and heartbreaking performances extracted from the actors by a highly committed director who doesn't compromise in conveying the gruesomeness of the subject matter,9,28 April 2012,"Teena Brandon masquerades as a boy by stuffing a sock under her pants and flattening her breasts by binding them; she does this not because she considers herself a lesbian but because she cannot identify herself as a girl. This is the difference that distinguishes her from others, and develops a sexual identity crisis in her. Never does Teena as Brandon try to recognize her femininity; in fact, she tries to conceal it completely. Teena as Brandon is spunky, foul-mouthed, gutsy, amiable and sometimes reckless; Brandon as Teena (as the movie progresses we get to see shades of her) is delicate, vulnerable, pitiable and helpless; Brandon does not want Teena to weaken her, and she is emboldened when she is Brandon. Hilary Swank assumes the role of Brandon Teena in Boys Don't Cry, a poignant drama on the life of Brandon Teena, a young human being who was raped and murdered by her close male friends after being exposed as a woman posing as a man. For Hilary, this role is extensively challenging because she has to make Brandon believable; Brandon does not come from rich surroundings, neither does he possess exquisite talent or intelligence or have a terrific story to tell. He is a young trans-gender who has faced years of abuse at the hands of his uncle (not covered in the movie) and who only wants the world to accept him. Sadly, he cannot undergo a sex-change operation because of financial troubles, and therefore he has to remain careful regarding his identity. In the second scene, Brandon cannot take his eyes off a young girl and manages to kiss her by the end of their first date; the girls themselves fall for Brandon easily. But immediately, a group of flaring men chase and pelt Brandon with stones until he finds shelter in his cousin's trailer. His cousin fears for his own life and cannot put up with Brandon's constant negative attention-grabbing behavior, and therefore evicts him from his trailer. Brandon then befriends two ex-convicts and their friends, which includes his future girlfriend Lana, and becomes bedazzled by his newfound companions. However, these same relations possess a potential threat for him when he and Lana fall in love and skeletons begin to tumble out eventually. Swank is a wonder here – she conveys Brandon's confusion, happiness, acceptance, hurt, grief and fear with such subtlety we never find a moment of falseness from her performance. I saw this movie about a week ago and so my review may seem slightly unpolished but I can tell you one thing, that when Brandon begins to whimper as he is, being raped, his screams hint a presence of Teena underneath him. Hillary's acting is so powerful is that it became difficult for me to watch the entire scene without pausing once to cry watching her helplessness. Then there is Chloe Sevigny as Lana Tisdel, a hopeless drug addict whose life is as hollow as her karaoke performance in the bar. Lana's life changes after she meets Brandon who turns her from this confused and submissive wreck to an independent woman who stands by Brandon and is able to see her life more clearly. Chloe manages to give much more depth to her character and conveys her hopelessness, loss, love, confusion, and support through her beautiful eyes. Peter Sarsgaard plays John Lotter, a self-destructive man, whose only outlet for hiding his weakness is to do drugs, commit violence and lose impulse. His friend Tom Nissen, played by Brendan, is slightly more stable but in the same quagmire as his friend, cutting himself to calm his impulses. Sarsgaard makes Lotter intimidating and fearful, a highlight being when Lotter isn't able to accept his fault of encouraging Brandon to drag race and evade the police, and he brazenly tells the group, except Lana to get out of the car, leaving them stranded. Here, Nissen's reaction to Brandon's defense against Lotter is noteworthy as he tries to calm Brandon down to no avail.The technical aspects of the movie are also surprisingly unconventional; director Kimberley Pierce takes us extremely close to the characters' mental state, which is mostly spaced-out because of all the drugs. This works for most of the film, especially in case of Lana, and makes the confrontational scenes even more haunting, because that is when things begin losing their haziness. I was not very impressed with the slow-motion sequence towards the end of the movie and would've opted for a quicker, more shocking end for Brandon.Boys Don't Cry is a great film whose director (and writer) Kimberly is genuinely interested in its subject (unlike the recent failing of Ms. Phyllida Lloyd) and knows how to get emotional response from her characters and get the audience closer to the character's own perceptions. It may be putting-off for many because of the subject matter, the rape scene and the pace, but anyone who is ready to give the film a chance will be mesmerized by the performances, the story, the characters and the direction.My Rating: 8.6 out of 10",Boys Don't Cry
56,moviesleuth2,"Shocking, Brutal, Powerful",9,10 July 2010,"I've been sitting here for about twenty minutes deciding how to start this review, and I can't think of one. Maybe it's just best to describe what the film is like. ""Boys Don't Cry"" is an absolutely riveting film. It held my absolute attention from frame one, and as the end credits rolled, I sat in my chair completely stunned.A young man saunters into a bar and starts chatting up a girl sitting two seats away from him. He tells her his name is Brandon, and she appears to like him. After a burly man starts getting fresh with her, he steps in, and a brawl ensues. Brandon makes quick friends with the girl, named Candace (Alica Goranson), and her friends. But this charming, sensitive young man is hiding a secret: he's biologically female.This film is based on the true story of Brandon Teena, a trans man who was brutally raped and later murdered by John Lotter and Tom Nissen, two men he considered his friends. As told by co-writer/director Kimberly Peirce, it is a fiercely compelling and devastating story.Much of the reason why this film works so well is because the performances are superb. Hilary Swank won an Oscar for her portrayal of Brandon. Although the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences has made some serious blunders in who they give their awards, this is not one of them. Swank is nothing short of incredible. I've seen ""The Year of Living Dangerously,"" where Linda Hunt portrayed a male character (and won an Oscar for it). Hunt was terrific, but prior knowledge inhibited me from completely buying into the character. Somehow Swank manages to overcome this, and it took about ten minutes for me to stop seeing ""Swank playing a guy"" and just see Brandon Teena. But the physical transformation isn't the only reason why she's so good. Swank embodies the character completely to a degree that I've never seen before. Brandon is not a rocket scientist, and unquestionably naiive. He knows what he wants, but he fails to really think about the possible consequences of trying to pass himself off as a man. In fact, his penchant for trouble and his naiveté actually present the possibility of a personality disorder. Nevertheless, Brandon is a tender and romantic soul whose sensitivity makes the girls swoon over him. This is probably one of the most complex characters ever to grace the screen, and Swank creates a person who is startlingly real. This is not just a breakthrough performance; this is a performance of a lifetime.Swank walks away with the film, but the other actors are also great. Chloe Sevigny is great as Lana, the girl who becomes romantically involved with Brandon. The development of this subplot is rather rushed, but the performances by Swank and Sevigny make it work nonetheless. Lana is a wounded soul who desperately wants to escape her life of boredom and reprehensible men, and Brandon is her escape. It's a low-key performance, but it works very well. Peter Saarsgard is an actor who plays facets of himself, but ""Peter Saarsgard as a psychopath"" works as John Lotter. He seems like an okay guy, but there is always the potential for violence whenever he's around. Unfortunately, Brandon never realizes this, or perhaps he is so desperate for his transformation to work that he ignores it. Alicia Goranson is very good as Candace, who's even more naiive and simple-minded than Brandon, and Jeanetta Cunningham is excellent as Lana's alcoholic mother.The film is expertly told by Kimberly Peirce. It's not flawless (as I said, the Brandon/Lana romance is a little rushed, there's a ""dream shot"" that is ill-placed, and one of Brandon's crimes is confusing), but it is always compelling. She has a keen eye for establishing the setting. This is small town Nebraska, where there is nothing to do but get drunk every night and go to work to pick up a paycheck so you can drink some more. This enhances the story by creating a place where this all can happen. Boredom and a lack of education have given birth to a place where something this horrifying can occur.This is not an easy film to watch. But for those who venture into this film will find a film that is absolutely unforgettable.",Boys Don't Cry

There she meets Lana (Chloë Sevigny), whose philosophy on life includes, `You don't have to be sober to weigh spinach,' and falls in love. She, still as Brandon, falls into the `gang' that includes Lana, John (Peter Sarsgaard), and Tom (Brendan Sexton III). Then, when people start finding out that Brandon Teena may not be Brandon Teena, things get bad.Strong language, brutal rape, and nudity is included in Boys Don't Cry. It certainly is an exciting piece of art if you're ready to be shocked. I felt a connection to Brandon. I didn't feel like I was Brandon, but I could understand what she was going through. She didn't really want to get involved with all of the drunkenness and dangerous activities everyone else was doing, but she had to do it anyway. She had the courage to be what she wanted to be, an important message that may be used in too many movies now, but especially holds strong in this one.Hilary Swank puts in an exceptional performance, showing true emotion, and she makes this little indie pic known and brought it to Oscar status. Sevigny also was nominated for best Supporting Actress, but didn't win, for some unknown reason. She was truly great, also. I don't want to list everyone in the movie and how good they were, so I'll just say that everyone was great.If I had to complain about this movie, I have three. First, I thought, a lot of times, there wasn't much character development and that the characters were muddled, since I didn't know who some of them were at times, such as Kate. Secondly, for the first half of the film or so, the movie didn't explore Brandon's cross-dressing, which is the main point of the film. Third, the make-up on Brandon's face was obvious at time, but if you get engrossed in the movie like I was, you won't notice anything wrong.Boys Don't Cry is an emotional tour de force that you won't forget for a long time.My rating: 9/10Rated R for violence including an intense brutal rape scene, sexuality, language and drug use.",Boys Don't Cry
58,LebowskiT1000,Not Very Good,6,13 May 2002,"I don't know why this movie got such high praises or why it has such a high rating on this site, it really wasn't that good.  I thought the movie was completely predictable and very infuriating.  I feel sorry for the real-life person that Hillary Swank portrayed, but at the same time, she totally brought everything on herself.  She was advised repeatedly by her friend to change her ways, but she chose to ignore him and continue surrounding herself with those horrible people, which ultimately led to her demise.No disrespect intended toward Hillary Swank, but I don't really see why she got an oscar for her acting.  So she has the ability to cut her hair and look like a feminine boy, big deal.All in all, I didn't think it was a very good movie, and I'm VERY glad I waited till video for this one.  I wouldn't go out of my way to see this movie again, so I wouldn't recommend you going out of your way to see it, unless you're curious like I was as to what all the talk was about. Anyhow, I hope you like it more than I did.  Thanks for reading,-Chris",Boys Don't Cry
59,MichaelMargetis,"""I just need to learn to stay home, huh? "" - Brandon Teena",8,14 December 2005,"'Boys Don't Cry' was the most disturbing picture of 1999 but it was also one of the best. It was true to it's subject, very powerful and sported two great performances along with a spectacular one. Hilary Swank well-deserved her Best Actress Oscar for beautifully portraying the real-life person Brandon Teena, a gender-confused lesbian who wandered around down South disguised as a boy to score hot girls. The tragic true story ended with Brandon Teena being brutally raped and murdered by two mouth-breathing violent hicks (played in the film by Welcome to the Dollhouse's Brendan Sexton III and the ever-so-brilliant Peter Sarsgaard) who were her buddies when they thought she was a boy. Chloe Sevigny (in a performance I actually really like her in) plays Lana, Peter Sarsgaard's sister who befriends and eventually falls in love with Brandon. Kimberly Pierce does a decent job directing her debut but she does a fantastic job with the film's screenplay. Peter Sarsgaard is perfectly diabolical in a performance that should have earned him an Oscar nomination for 'Best Supporting Actor', while Chloe Sevigny is great in her performance that actually won her a nomination for 'Best Supporting Actress'. However, the movie belongs to Hilary Swank who in it manages to distinguish herself as an actress in the ranks of Meryl Streep and Glenn Close. Swank is breathtaking simply put and engages you in her role for every second she is on screen. 'Boys Don't Cry' is indescribably disturbing, especially during it's needed but gut-wrenching rape scene, but if you can handle it I think you will find it to be a very good film. Yes, there is flaws like running a little long and dragging a bit towards the middle, but for what it is worth 'Boys Don't Cry' is a great film and an excellent debut. Grade: B+",Boys Don't Cry
60,christophe92300,Long and unproductive,4,6 November 2014,"Despite the director/writer good intentions, the movie as a whole turns out to be too muddled : there is no clear line, you just drift inside this group with absolutely no dramatic tension except at the end when everything accelerates tragically. This type of subject must be tackled with grip which isn't the case here, scenes follow each other in a boring monotony and there is a terrible lack of identification with the characters especially Brandon, perfectly embodied by Hillary Swank. After barely 45 minutes, all hope for this real story is lost and the outcome therefore comes off as a great relief for a long and unproductive movie.",Boys Don't Cry
61,SKG-2,"Sad, powerful look at identity",10,1 December 1999,"I've read a couple of the negative comments on this film and was struck by one theme; the complaint that they couldn't relate to any of these people. I think that's incredibly short-sighted.  This movie is about someone who was struggling with questions about their own identity, and society's attitude towards it.  We may not be exactly like Brandon Teena/Teena Brandon, but who among us hasn't, at some point in our lives, struggled with some kind of identity question, at who we are and how we fit in, especially in today's world, when we're bombarded with how we're supposed to fit a ""perfect"" mold, and are left aside when we don't?So in addition to Brandon's story, we get the parallel story of Lana, played beautifully by Chloe Sevigny, who is fast emerging as one of our best young actresses.  Like Brandon, Lana struggles with questions of identity.  She works in a factory on the night shift, and lives in a small town where there's nothing to do(except the odd karaoke night) and no one new to be with.  She's headed for the stereotypical role we apply to woman at her stage in life, and while she knows she doesn't want that, she sees no way of escaping.  Then she meets Brandon, and for the first time, sees a hope of escaping.  For her, the talk of Memphis and singing for a living is more than just a dream, it's a way to open up new worlds for her.  This, perhaps, is why she denies to herself who Brandon really is.That feeling, initially, is also why Lana's friends, including John and Tom also deny to themselves who Brandon really is.  He brings something fresh and different to their world, just by being so gung-ho to join (even after Brandon screws up so many times early on when trying to ride on the back of a truck, we can see John cheered by his perseverance).  And as one reviewer up here pointed out, if Brandon did deceive everybody, it was a willing deception; they so wanted something new they wore blinders until things came to a head.  And yet while this was a horrible crime, director Kimberly Peirce manages to convince us that these weren't terrible people; they just did a terrible thing.Of course, I have to mention Hilary Swank in the main role, especially since I was going to pass this up because of her initially.  I had seen her in a couple of movies(BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER) and wasn't impressed, plus she was on Beverly Hills 90210.  But she's amazing here.  You can always sense the longing Brandon has to be accepted, as we all do, to be accepted for who we are.",Boys Don't Cry
62,AKS-6,Swank is phenomenal in well-made film,8,26 November 1999,"""Boys Don't Cry"" is without a doubt the best American film I have seen at the cinema since ""American History X"". It's a touching, heart-rending and very powerful film about a young man who really is a woman. What happens when his friends find out about him being a woman is very shocking and very disturbing. Knowing that it is based upon a true story is absolutely harrowing.""Boys Don't Cry"" is very well-made even though I consider it to be a bit too long. Hilary Swank is phenomenal as Brandon Teena/Teena Brandon and Chloë Sevigny is almost as good. Swank deserves all the praise she has won, and at the Stockholm Film Festival she won the best actress award. Swank certainly deserves an Academy Award nomination as well -- she is absolutely brilliant. (8/10)",Boys Don't Cry
63,room102,A missed opportunity,5,9 October 2015,"* This review contains a spoiler for the movie ""Predestination"" *I've watched this movie 2-3 times before, but not in quite some time. The movie is just as flawed as I remembered it. There are so many things about it that just don't work.First of all the writing and direction: They are just bad. Here is such an interesting subject for a movie and yet they managed to present it in such a boring way. It's slow, during at least half the movie almost nothing happens and we are slowly introduced to very boring and one- dimensional characters and environment.Now, Hilary Swank: She is a good actress - I came to like her only from this movie and ""Million Dollar Baby"", which both earned her pretty deserving Oscars. Still, during the entire time I couldn't stop thinking: ""This is Hilary Swank"" and ""this is a girl, not a boy"". It's usually a very bad sign, when I watch a movie and can't stop thinking about seeing the actual actor and not the character. It's very distracting, too. A movie should be good enough to have the suspension of disbelief make you forget you're watching actors doing their job. I don't know if that's the fault of Hilary Swank (I do think she gave a good performance), or maybe she needed more makeup/prosthetics or maybe it's a problem with the direction. What I'm quite certain is that she DID need to change her voice - it would have helped a lot.Now compare this movie to ""Predestination"" (my favorite movie of 2014), with the brilliant performance of Sarah Snook. I'd take ""Predestination"" anytime over ""Boys Don't Cry"". Snook's performance, together with the makeup and prosthetics made an amazing character - it was extremely convincing (at least for me), to the point that I needed to go check IMDb the first time I watched the movie (and thus ruin it a little bit for myself) in order to understand what is going on and find out whether the role is played by two actors or just one. If I'd have to choose between Swank's performance and Snook's performance, I'd definitely choose the latter - it's so much more believable and makes you forget you're watching an actress in makeup even when you know that.Peter Sarsgaard is very good in his poorly-written role and almost unrecognizable; Chloe Sevigny is also very good in her poorly-written role.All in all, this is a very missed opportunity, which could have been made into a MUCH better movie in the hands of more capable writer and director.",Boys Don't Cry
64,DavidYZ,Repulsive,1,23 April 2017,"This is a disgusting mess of a film about repulsive people.

65,buckikris,"A Powerful Movie About The Life And Death Of Brandon R. Teena, A.K.A. Teena R. Brandon.",10,3 June 2020,"This is an excellent movie everyone should see regardless of your views toward the LGBTQ Community. Boys Don't Cry was directed by Kimberly Pierce. The film was suppose to be filmed in Falls City, NE.. Due to budget constraints they filmed it in Texas. The film is brilliant and if you gave it a poor rating you just didn't get it. A excellent movie with an outstanding cast, an outstanding performance by Hilary Swank and Chloe Sevigny. Here is my review of one of my favorite films, Boys Don't Cry.This film is about Brandon Teena( Hilary Swank) who is a transgender man. Brandon is actually Teena R. Brandon, a girl who want to be a boy; but can't afford the surgery. Brandon's only relative is a cousin, Lonny( Matt McGrath). Brandon and Lonnie live in Lincoln N.E.. One night Brandon tells Lonny he really has a date with a girl at a roller rink. Lonny can't believe it, but Brandon meets this girl. That night the girl's brother finds out Brandon's is actually a girl. They chase him all the way back to Lonny's trailer, and threaten to kill him. Well, Lonnie has had it and kicks Brandon out; and Brandon decides to move on.
Brandon decides to go a bar and think . At a bar he meets Candace( Lecy Goranson), and two of her friends. They are Ex-Cons each with a troubled past, when a bar fight starts John Lotter( Peter Sarsgaard) and Tom Nieseen( Brendon Sexton) jump in a help Brandon out. They all leave for Fall City, N.E., were Brandon meets Lana Tisdel( Chloe Sevigny) who sings karaoke at the bar along with her friends. As soon as he sees Lana he is in love with her, and he forms a bond with John and Tom. Brandon quickly gets into a relationship with Lana which kind of ticks John off. The two of them used to date, but wonders what Lana sees in him. If you ask me the two guys were suspicious of Brandon at the start.
When Brandon updates his cousin Lonny, he is shocked to learn that Brandon is in Falls City. A known town for their distaste of homosexuals. As Brandon and Lana's romantic relationship continues, Lana notice's notices something one night when the two are intimate; but doesn't say anything. To her, Brandon is a man or so it seems. One day Brandon is arrested and put in the women's ward. He tells Lana he was born with both sex organs, and is waiting for the surgery. Lana tells him that's his business, and she loves him regardless.One day Candace discovers some incriminating evidence about Brandon. While cleaning his room she discovers the applicator of a tampon in between the bed. Her checkbook with missing checks and documents with Brandon's real name on them. She tells John and Tom, at first they think it's a misprint, but then they search his room. There they find literature on transgender and various male sex attachments. They are shocked and disgusted, as soon as Brandon walks in the S**T hits the fan. John and Tom take Brandon into a bathroom and force him to strip, there they find out Brandon is a female. When this happens they take Brandon for a ride.They take him to a remote location were the brutally beat and rape him numerous times. Afterwards they go back to Tom's house and tell him to keep it secret. If it is reported they will kill him, so while Brandon is washing up he escapes and reports the attack. Brandon is questioned by this tool of a sheriff, Sheriff Laux(Lou Perryman) who takes a careless attitude, and no empathy what so ever. John and Tom are questioned and released, that night they get drunk. They are both extremely intoxicated and they decide to kill Brandon. They arrive at Candice's house and find Brandon hiding out in her shed. When Brandon walks in he is shot and killed, and Candice is also killed.I could relate to this movie well, because I saw myself as Brandon. I can't believe people are still so close minded. It makes me sad that people can't accept people because they don't abide by the gender stereotypes. That is what is wrong with this society, remember we don't get to pick which sex we want to be. It is already assigned, and we do the best we can with what we have. If society can't accept that, that's their problem.",Boys Don't Cry

Once she is discovered and found out, she is viciously raped, and then later on after she goes to the police, is murdered by her same attacker in 1993.Since I knew about the story before hand, you know the film is going to be a tragic ending and perhaps somewhat predictable.  However, Hillary Swanks Academy Award performance as Brandon is AMAZING.  Hillary looks and acts so much like a guy it is fantastic.  Brandon-Teena seems like such an amazing character to go through the things he did.  What he had to go through, in such a place took a lot of guts.  Good cinematography as well.

67,Quicksand,"Powerful, thoughtful",8,29 December 1999,"This is not the story of a woman living as a man, because that would imply that this woman merely dressed up and fooled people.  That's not at all what's going on.This is the story of a male who thought male, felt male, and WAS male, but looked down at the body God gave him, and saw that of a female.  It's not homosexuality, or cross-dressing.  The name given to it, in the film, is Sexual Identity Crisis, but I don't really think it's a crisis.  I don't think there's anything wrong with Brandon Teena, or Teena Brandon, thinking that.  It is merely who he is.And this movie did make me think about it, and that is its success. Powerful at times, repulsive at times, those whose lives this story affected may not approve of the final film, but it can still open the eyes of people toward things in this world that they previously might not have understood... which may help the next Brandon find and keep happiness in his or her life.Worth seeing, but not for the weak of stomach or easily offended.",Boys Don't Cry

Words are far and apart and when spoken-is gibberish. You need a GPS system to know what the hell is happening where in Midwest. This should have been a suspense movie, the suspense being-when Brandon will be exposed? when Lana's mother examines him closely? in the prison? but the writers (mediocre with no humor in the dialogs) were clever in putting that puzzle to the last. Hillary Swank (as Brandon) is not the most attractive or femme-fatale in Hollywood, and she didn't need much makeover to be cute looking ""Claude Raines"". She is not an Oscar material (She is not Charlize Theron in ""Monster"") but morons in Hollywood. who vote for Oscars, are a close knit dumb-asses who give Oscars to ""Slumdog Millionaire"" have no class or taste left. None of the other characters are appealing-the usual smoking, drinking and speeding kind, as seen in a bunch of Hollywood movies, but this is not ""American Graffiti"" by any strech. The ending is quite disturbing and poignant at the same time, since both characters seem to have lot in common with their sexual and social identity, but the fate had different plans.

70,Bob Pr.,"Good movie, worth seeing; excellent casting and acting.",10,1 April 2000,"Hillary & Chloe received well-deserved recognition for their roles but _all_ the actors were really exceptional.  The characterizations were true to life and captured fairly well a certain small subculture of rural slums that tolerates episodic trouble with the law, impulsive disorders, polysubstance abuse, and a few antisocial personalities among a semi-permanent group of people who see themselves as (and function like) ""family.""The movie is short on answers as to ""why"" anything happens.  It's as if Brandon was 'just born that way.'  Perhaps so, but among transvestites & gender change candidates I've had in therapy, they've often endured -- while a child -- either a painful episode or atmosphere from which they emerge with a hope that becomes a belief that a change in gender will finally make the unhappiness and misery inside go away -- somewhat as a butterfly finally emerges from a cocoon.  I've heard that Teena's mother has recently criticized the movie for not showing that Teena was sexually abused as a child.  It certainly wouldn't be surprising to me if Teena did have that in her history.I heard some people blaming ""Lana's Mom"" for not exercising more judgment and structure for her extended family.  But, in my experience, people like Lana's mom themselves usually grew up in a family that is dysfunctionally similar (often worse in some respects) to the one in which she raised Lana. So the person in her position easily feels and says, ""hey, what's wrong? -- this is as good as it gets.""   Certainly not a ""fun"" movie any more than ""Schindler's List"" is; some scenes were too painful for me to watch.   But it does tell its story very well and is very well done.",Boys Don't Cry
71,pensacolacomputer,Rest in peace,10,4 December 2017,"Sorry, but this review is going to be a little haphazard. It also might contain a couple of spoilers! Its been a while since I've seen this movie. Today is December 4, 2017, I just watched the two hour documentary on YouTube from 1998. I am crying as I write this as it brings back memories of seeing the film in 1999. I feel such a connection to Brandon Teena, I am gay as well, except I was born a boy...when he was not...but he should have been.The Police officers involved needed to be punished and tried as well. The officer who interviewed Brandon should be in jail for murder for not arresting John and Tom for raping Brandon. And for the way he conducted the interview. If you haven't seen the real interview, it will probably blow your mind in disgust. There are a few positive things that came out of this tragedy. It brought much needed attention to gay rights, gay bashing, and transgender rights.I just read a couple of other reviews on here. I can see things haven't really changed that much from 1993 when this story took place. Sad. May God have mercy on your souls for such hate.If you haven't seen the movie, stop what you are doing and go watch it. It is a MUST SEE for any decent human being.

72,j-lacerra,Boys Don't Lie (well),5,19 September 2010,"Boys Don't Cry is an ambitious movie, which chronicles the tragedy of a transgender attempt by its main character, played by Hilary Swank, to be the male she believes she was meant to be. Swank does not have to persuade us, the viewers, that she is a male. We know she is Hilary Swank, actress. What she has to do is persuade us that her character can fool the other characters in the movie that she is a guy. This I never bought for even a flashing moment.Given her small hands, slight build, delicate features, and female voice, I am certain Brandon (Swank) would have been 'clocked', or outed, in a few seconds, both by men and by women. I never for one moment believed she could have fooled a soul, let alone a girl-friend and some beer-buddies. This, of course, is the ruination of the film's power for me. Also, it is the total depreciation of Swank's character for me.That said, that the critical linchpin of the story was a farce for me, the movie sinks into the realm of disbelief. Further, I found neither the rape scene nor the murder scene shocking or particularly repulsive. Just another instance of movie violence.I have used the term 'for me' quite often in this review. That is because I realize that many reviewers were convinced, shocked, and impressed. It is just that I was not. Worth seeing to draw your own conclusions.",Boys Don't Cry
73,ilovedolby,A film of brutal truth.,10,29 May 2003,"***SPOILERS***   ***SPOILERS*** It's hard to believe that the events portrayed in the film `Boys Don't Cry' could have actually happened. The level of homophobia, violence, and absolute fear of the unknown seems more reminiscent of a movie where everything is sensationalized. Unfortunately, it is based on a true story that took place during 1993, where a young woman with a sexual identity crisis was brutally murdered in Nebraska. Exceptional performances from Hillary Swank (`The Core'), Chloe Sevigny (`The Last Days of Disco') and Peter Sarsgaard (`K19: The Widowmaker'), and the marvelous direction of Kimberly Peirce make `Boys Don't Cry' a film of brutal truth.Brandon Teena (Swank) is not all he seems. Brandon is the chosen name of Teena Brandon, a lesbian who prefers to dress and act like a man. She holds herself out to be a man one night at bar and meets some guys who accept her into their group of friends. She also meets Lana (Sevigny), a girl who hates her life and wants to run away from her one horse town. The two become close friends and eventually a relationship forms, however, Lana has no idea until her first sexual experience with Brandon, that he is in fact a woman. Lana is still drawn to Brandon, though, and her secret remains safe with Lana until one of Lana's live in friends, John (Sarsgaard), finds out what is really going on. John, being jealous, a drunkard and all out 'redneck,' rapes Brandon with his friend, and eventually kills her.`Boys Don't Cry' is filled with disturbing images that easily shock the film's viewers because of the level of ignorance and violence that exist in some of the characters. John and his friend Tom spend most of the day getting drunk, high and both have a affinity for inflicting pain on one another, as one scene has Tom showing Brandon the cuts that the two inflicted upon each other in prison, just to see who could take the most pain. The scene of the rape of Brandon is extremely difficult to watch, as is the murder-both are quite grisly, and heart wrenching to endure.Hillary Swank gives the performance of her career. Her portrayal of Brandon garnished her an Oscar for Best Actress. Swank comes off so realistically as a guy, that it's difficult to believe she is actually a woman. Also, her portrayal of the pain that Brandon feels due to her differences from everyone else is done so masterfully, that one can't help but feel sorrow for her. Films like `Boys Don't Cry' send a message to filmgoers that the importance of tolerance and understanding is essential in life. No person is the same as everyone else and it's necessary that society understand that. Brandon Teena wanted nothing more than to be a man. That's not an easy thing to accept, but the point is that to the average person, it's not his or her business what kind of lifestyle someone else chooses to lead. People need to be judged on their personalities and characters, not on their preferences in life. `Boys Don't Cry' drives that message home-if we live in fear of those who are different or that which is unknown, we will bring about the destruction of our own lives, the lives of the people around us. ****",Boys Don't Cry

76,danielll_rs,A great movie with an amazing strength,7,2 April 2000,"""Boys Don't Cry"", the debut film of director Kimberly Peirce, is more than anything a movie about who you really are to yourself and to the others. It's a story about courage, strength, love. Not only because of the strong sexuality and violence, but also because of its serious thematics and the way it treats these subjects, ""Boys Don't Cry"" is the strongest film of '99.The story, which has been shocking many people, is about a girl named Teena Brandon (Hilary Swank) who dresses like and considers herself a boy, and changes her name for Brandon Teena. After some trouble in his town, Brandon meets a group of people and go with them to Falls City, in Nebraska. There his life will change even more, specially after he meets Lana (Chloe Sevigny), a girl who is tired of her life. Many things will happen, and I'm not able to tell this here, even this being a true story.What is special in this film is that we forget that it is based on real life. And this is because of the amazing performance by Hilary Swank. I was quite unsure if she deserved to win the Oscar, because she was competing with Annette Bening and Julianne Moore! But she won, and now I can understand why. The film has many qualities, but it wouldn't have been so good without Hilary. It is one of the best female performances of the '90s. But Chloe Sevigny shouldn't be forgotten. She is worth of as much recognition as Ms. Swank, in a very difficult role too.
With a great film editing and a very well written screenplay, ""Boys Don't Cry"" is a must-see. However, it is not for everyone. Some scenes can shock many people, and people who are not mature enough shouldn't see it.
When the film ends, we get back to reality and realize that it was all true. It's so sad, unfair and absurd how things like that happen because of a dirty feeling. It gives a great discussion about how truly unfair and ugly inside some people are. But the world is not lost...9/10",Boys Don't Cry

She just wants to hang out with the guys and have fun.  Unless you see the film, you might picture in your mind a butch lesbian type, but Brandon is a unique person and not a caricature.  She lives partly in a fantasy world all her own, not really sure how to define herself to others, but she reaches out to one particular girl and connects.  Her love scenes with Lana, played by Chloe Sevigny, are as torrid as any on film.Other than Hilary Swank's performance, the rest of the movie is just so-so. Brandon falls in with a bad crowd in a rural Nebraska trailer park - ex-cons and their alcoholic, druggie circle of friends - and the inevitable bad ending happens.  The other characters are good and the film has a realistic edge to it, but you're really just focused on Swank most of the time. Which is a pretty good thing.",Boys Don't Cry
78,m_madhu,"dark, disturbing and sensitive",8,11 January 2002,"boys don't cry is a harsh movie. the movie is a no holds barred look at a troubled kid who has a sexual identity crisis. hillary swank is brilliant. i hate the argument that some people come up with - swank is too pretty to be covincing as a boy, she is so believable, that somewhere along the movie for a moment or two i had forgotten that it was indeed a girl. the most touching character to me was lana. chloe plays the character out brilliantly. her acceptance of teena when she realises the truth. is puzzling to many. but thats the beauty of love i think. sometimes nothing makes sense, and it all is just perfect that way. boys don't cry is full of such complex and sensitive characters. a lot of the characters and their lives is determined and governed by their cultural background and baggages. but without truly understanding it, its difficult for me to form opinions on them. one thing, is for certain. emotions are common across cultures. the way they are played out might be different. boys don't cry is a touching movie about the struggle to ""fit in"", find a place for oneself. and the trauma of having to be who you cannot be. a touching 8!!",Boys Don't Cry

Admittedly this film is not for everyone: Homophobes should probably skip it.  Also, people who don't like seeing realistic and sympathetic portrayals of people who are clearly white trash. (By ""white trash"" I am not referring to geography or economic status, but a mode of behavior.)Brandon Teena (aka Teena Brandon), a man trapped in a woman's body, gets into a barfight over a girl named Candace one night, and his/her life changes forever.  A seemingly affable guy named John helps him/her out, and Candace takes Brandon home with her to a small town south of Lincoln, Nebraska.  We soon learn that Brandon is a wanted on several counts of petty larceny, assault, and Grand Theft Auto.  We learn too, that John, for all his friendliness and charm, is a dangerously violent psychopath.Brandon soon falls in love with a girl--Lana--who lives platonically with John.  The whole town learns the truth when Brandon tries to pay a speeding ticket with a fake ID and tragedy ensues.This movie is not perfect:  Despite living in the icy midwest, everyone affects a southern drawl.  And Lincoln looks an awful lot like Dallas (where the movie was made).  But overall, a compelling story and strong performances made me give this movie a 9.",Boys Don't Cry

Hilary Swank gives the best performance she's ever given here. She does a great job at making you care about this tortured character. I'd say her performance is the highlight of the film. Everyone else does a pretty nice job as well. The people playing the evil murderers did their job of making me hate them and the other side characters did their jobs fine. The film tells the story of real life teenager Brandon Teena who was murdered for being transgender, and for the most part, the film tells this story fairly well. Only problem though is it tends to ignore the more flawed aspects of the character. The real life person had quite a criminal record, and while they do mention this several times in the movie, I never felt they truly explored that side of the character. The film instead decided to focus more on making the audience care about the main character, which is fine, I just would have liked both aspects of the character to have been touched on with equal amounts. In the end, it's still a pretty great film. The film makes you care and the more uncomfortable scenes don't feel excessive and unnecessary. Go see it.",Boys Don't Cry

Especially if he found that Teena was a girl, it would be a catastrophe for Teena.The present society is more and more tolerant for homosexuality. It is really the huge progress for mankind.

Had she been born in New York City or London, she might have made the transition to Brandon Teena, not without struggle and trauma, but perhaps not so alone and self-destructive. The film, by debut director Kimberly Pierce, is extremely intense, the very small cast magnifying our involvement with each character. There's no limit to the praise for Hilary Swank's performance as the androgynous protagonist: she took both the Oscar and the Golden Globe as well as numerous other awards. Chloe Sevigny also garnered wide recognition for her portrayal of the young woman who ultimately accepted Brandon for himself. Surprisingly, this movie manages to be entertaining, and even elicits a few smiles, as it progresses ineluctably to its conclusion.

Definitely your life.The tragic tale of Brandon Teena opens with an enormous effort from the moviemakers, to make the audience fell in love with him. We are supposed to understand his obsession, and most of his actions towards it.When you denying your deepest identity, you'll ended up denying yourself. Your life. He starts denying his sexual identity, his appearance, his life, and finally himself. It is so sad to see the cost of betrayal he has to pay, when the folks who welcomes him finally see the truth.In a stunning work, these darkest side of our morals' been exposed and interpret perfectly in this movie. The casts are perfect, and we can see directly into their own eyes and characters. Musical scores and cinematography are fair good. They respectfully stand down to let the story and message flow easily. In short, it's a fine work. And a tragic tale.We ended up wondering about ourselves; and how it is luxurious to be able to accept ourselves and others. With a slight pain to see that the boyish face often look things in a simple and very narrow way. If somehow she wanted to be seen and treated as a boy, then for that purpose she is referred as him in this review on Teena Brandon's behalf.Hillary Swank is definitely Brandon Teena. Very total and honest. In Kimberly Pierce's hand, she is him and he is us. A successful team work.It's definitely a must-see movie. You can learn and get so much from this movie. Despite the pain.

The performances, most notably Hillary Swank's, are extrodinarily strong all round, and the story is a captivating one that will challenge many to think in different ways. The one downside to the movie is that it's based on actual events that people who see it will already know the outcome, however I was so captivated by the characters and the movies story that I went through long periods of time not even thinking about the real life story, and in the end somehow I was more shocked and saddened than I expected to be.

I did not feel sorry for the gal with the sexual identity crisis because of the way she handled/mishandled it.  The way she lied and deceived without regard for the emotional damage to be done to those she claimed to care about.  It made me angry and like I said uneasy by the time the film ended.

89,aldiboronti,Dishonest and manipulative exploitation movie,3,23 June 2017,"I am astonished at the high rating for this film. This is a movie whose makers cynically exploited the deaths of three people for their own ends, profit being the major one. Just consider the following.The Lana character, based on a real-life person as all of the characters are, is shown as being present at the murders. She wasn't and in fact sued the makers for saying she was there and also for depicting her as continuing to date Brandon after she discovered he was in fact a she. That's a lie too.How reckless and irresponsible is it to put someone at the scene of a murder they weren't at? The police could have arrested her and accused her of lying to them. I'm sure she had an alibi but what if she didn't? This girl could have ended up in prison as an accessory just because the idiotic movie company figured it would make a better story to place her there.The film turns Brandon into someone he wasn't. This woman/man was a total sociopath. He didn't care who he hurt or what damage he did to people as long as he could ""explore"" his sexuality. He could have been upfront with girls he was dating, explained the situation, but no, Brandon was the only one that mattered. People he sucked into his orbit ended up frightened, confused, nauseated or even dead. This guy was a danger to anyone he came into contact with. No, he didn't deserve to die but I'll keep my sympathy for the young mother and the unfortunate young man who ended up murdered as a direct result of meeting or befriending Brandon.The movie paints Brandon as a tortured transgender and that is correct, he was. What they leave out is his callous disregard for anyone but himself. But the movie makers don't care about Brandon, he's there to be exploited. He's there for Hilary Swank to use to get herself an Oscar in probably the hammiest and least-deserved Oscar-winning performance ever. But she didn't get the Oscar for acting, she got it because she was playing a murdered transgender, it was a PC role with an Oscar automatically attached to it. Anyone could have played it and still won the Oscar.Oh, except a real transgender. Hollywood will only go so far for political correctness. God forbid they should use the Real Thing.",Boys Don't Cry

Hilary Swank does a great job, sure, but for my money it was Chloe Sevigny that made this film watchable. If we didn't believe that SHE believed that 'he' was a 'she' (that's not a spoiler, unless you were born under a rock) then the whole movie would fall apart.

91,flickjunkie-3,A Moving Piece of Filmmaking.,9,2 December 2000,"Boys Don't Cry was a major success with the critics and the Academy Award's, so I looked forward to seeing it. Easily one of the best films of the past year, Boys Don't Cry is a moving experience that deserved all the credit it got, and then some.The film takes for its source material the true story of Brandon Teena (Hilary Swank), a girl who, well, just wants to be a boy. A sex-changing (getting her hair cut and sticking a dildo down her pants) credit sequence sees our hero(ine) at first on the pull, duping a local girl into a bit of nookie, and then on the run, when the truth about her sexuality rears its bizarre head. A fugitive of the law, as well as a few irate townsfolk, a twist of fate leads to her befriending a bunch of trailer-trash misfits and, temporarily, enjoying a new-found freedom under her manly guise. Of course, it's all going to go horribly wrong - particularly when she falls in love with the local girlie sweetheart (Chloe Sevigny).Chloe Sevigny, who plays the girl Brandon falls in love with, deserved to win an Academy Award. Her performance still lives in my memory, and it has been some time since I first saw Boys Don't Cry. Hilary Swank, who did receive an Oscar, pulls off an absolute barnstormer of a performance as Brandon Teena, it is easily one of the boldest and most memorable performances I saw in the 20th century. Kimberley Pierce is also another stand-out, she is in the director's chair, and she hardly got any praise for her amazing effort that she put into this film. I applaud everyone involved in Boys Don't Cry, even the one's who got little credit, particularly Brendan Sexton III (who plays a trouble-making misfit) and Andy Bienen (co-writer).Groundbreaking performances and a brilliant debut directing effort make this film unmissable.I rate Boys Don't Cry 9 out of 10.",Boys Don't Cry

Because the viewer is forced to pay more attention to the storyline, becoming involved with the characters.

97,stodruza,libidinal and psychological,7,29 October 2007,"This movie was confounding for me. There are so many forces at play, I feel I have to sift through them all in order to get at my thoughts regarding what is behind this work of art. I don't have to do any sifting, however, to get at the feelings which were going through me while I was watching it. I watched it with a sense of dread, because how else can one watch it? I suppose one can get engulfed in the film, in the sense of drama, but I guess I am getting old, and starting to think about films while I am watching them. It was inevitable from the beginning that something bad is going to happen. I suppose we are primed for this by everything shown early in this film, but I do not want to talk about the formal qualities of the film just yet. There is a sort of a time lapse release one gets with this film, at least I did, in that ""oh, this is the sense of freedom that is craved and one gets when one lives their life without thinking,"" and, this is the ultimate impetus, as I see it, in this film, which, I suppose, is mirrored in many aspects of American life. I hope it is undeniable that nobody does any thinking in this film, or has any sense of caution, not to say humility, except for the cousin who seems to understand in his bones that the best thing for Tina is to get put in jail, for the short term anyway, because even then her problems are only going to be postponed the way she chooses to live. And to her, it is such an imperative that it is not even a choice in the film what to do. She is so driven by her libidinal and psychological needs so that she can redeem her being in this society, that she is driven like an animal for that personal redemption. With severe blinders on. And, as it is shown in the film, this can only lead to destruction. With animals like those hick boys running around, and quite a few other predatory vectors of rural society, it is impossible, this film shows correctly, to ""go with the soul"" so to speak, and find your way and place in this society without thinking...Now it is probably impossible to find one's way through thinking also, it is such a labyrinth in America, so many pitfalls, but at least we can say that caution is necessary for self preservation, this film clearly shows, for people who are willing to think about it. Formally, I can only say that since everything was done perfectly well, even perfect, I can only disagree with the last few seconds of the film which introduces a short time lapse sequence. Was this film like a time lapse sequence? Does the director want to encourage the audience to see this film, finally, as a thoughtless roller coaster ride? I know she wanted to leave us with that cool feeling and exit on a high, but is that really the vision she wishes to perpetrate, or, as I understandingly admit, it is just a kind of an unconscious rejection of right discernment?! From Lana's point of view it was like a roller coaster ride, but why does K. Peirce wish us to consider the film from her point of view at its ending, and not Tina's after all the hard work has already been done? Anyway, no one will notice.",Boys Don't Cry

BOYS DON'T CRY is an emotionally shattering, hard-hitting movie and easily the best film of 1999. The movie tells the true story of Teena Brandon, a young woman who follows her sexual self-image by misrepresenting her outward identity. She cuts her hair, bandages down her breasts and begins living her life as a man named Brandon Teena. While not revealing too much about the story we come to realize that she will eventually pay for the deception.Director Kim Peirce reveals a world where people go ""bumper skiing"", get chased by cops and sleep on the couch with the television on. It's a film with the same kind of feeling as, let's say BADLANDS or DRUGSTORE COWBOY where the movie's effectiveness has a lot to do with the small mannerisms or details in the realistic setting. I will say, without praising the film too much, that I had some misgivings toward the deception. I was happy for Brandon and his relationship with the Sevigney character, but I questioned the approach she took to pulling it off. Nevertheless, how their relationship develops is incredible and is possibly one of the most impressive love stories I have seen in film. You really see how beautiful their world is.In conclusion, Pierce's camera work is distinctive and very effective. Hillary Swank's performance is the single best piece of acting in years. The fact that she got the Oscar just makes me forget all the times the Academy didn't get it right.",Boys Don't Cry

He is a transsexual (or ""suffering from a sexual identity crisis""), and desperately awaits the operation that will change his life for the better. He continually finds himself flirting with girls in bars under his preferred name of Brandon Teena, but always has to remind himself that he cannot go further with them. One of these girls, however, unaware that Brandon is ""technically"" female, introduces him to her circle of friends (including Peter Sarsgaard), and Brandon begins to feel a sense of normalcy creep into his troubled life. But he is always fearful of his new companions discovering his secret, especially when he begins to develop a more than physical attraction towards Lana (Chloe Sevigny).With the fact that 'Boys Don't Cry' is based on a true story comes a dilemma. What if you already knew what was going to happen? But even if one knows how this story will turn out, it would be hard not to be moved by the film's climax. In fact, knowledge of Brandon/Teena's fate may actually amplify the ending's emotional impact, as it makes the optimistic moments of 'Cry' all that more tragic.

I should regret I did not leave.This is another movie where the topic has been awarded and not the picture itself. Although I can sympathize with trans-genders' certainly faced everyday disturbing issues, I can not think of anything in this movie that would enhance their situation in any way. The story is violent mainly, and not revealing or fairly touching or interesting in any manner. Both Hilary Swank and Chloé Sevigny are doing their parts nicely, though.The plot has flaws such as Lana is not angry at all after her love interest turns out to be a woman. By that time the viewer also had to endure a painful love scene between the two. Nothing, well, strange, got noticed there, you see. And nobody minds in the end. Right.The rest of the story depicts the depreciating, hopeless area in which the characters reside. Nothing is said of, let's say, memories of Swank's character on how she turned out to be this way (born like it? trauma? woke up like it?), although I think it would be very important to enable the viewer to form an opinion. In case this has been left vague for a purpose, well, I do not believe that the viewers should not be allowed their opinions. It would have helped build the character. This way, Brendon remains a mystery. Why not wait until the OP is over and try find a lesbian girl-friend in the meantime? The reaction of the ""bad guys"" is not justifiable in any means, please do not get me wrong, but it is true that finding out that your buddy is a girl really could disturb anybody. I understand the movie is based on a real-life drama and I feel very sorry for the real Brandon. I had the impression that this movie is just using its topic to gain attention but does not give answers, or, although this would be the least to be expected, does not raise any questions.The two points go for the brave choice of the basic topic and the good performances.

After slogging the entire way through the ugly, depressing, predictable ending; and wondering what, beyond its undoubted brilliance in acting and cinematography, was the point, I discovered this fact only by reading on the screen, just before the credits rolled, that the perps were serving life sentences. Oh. That changes everything. Or does it? My hypothesis was confirmed, incidentally, that (with just a few exceptions such as the refreshingly un-PC _About_a_Boy_) the unlikeliest recent book or movie to feature a real boy character is one with the word ""boy"" in the title. Have you noticed?Being transgendered must be a very difficult card to be dealt in life, much more painful than being merely gay. Brandon easily won my sympathy on those grounds, but it was strained by the company he chose to keep. The moral of this story is very clear: Any young person with his condition and lack of career ties, with or without his stated ambition to live in Memphis or some-such metropolis, should head there immediately-- by sticking out a thumb on the highway if necessary-- rather than hanging around small towns in the American ""heartland."" There is a reason why gay people are such a presence in New York and San Francisco, and why they gravitate to urbane ""cultural"" occupations: while we will inevitably encounter individuals who don't like us very much, at least they are civilized enough not to stoop to actual mayhem and murder. And there's a reason why ""civilized"" derives from the Latin for ""city"". We have appreciated this for decades if not centuries. Many of us have also read _Lord_of_the_Flies. In this sense, the adjective ""disturbing"" for this film and its denouement is not only a cliché but a curiously naive one. Would someone who finds the word insightful please elaborate as to which of their assumptions it has disturbed?There is some cold comfort, I suppose, in pondering that social developments may soon, for awhile, make Teena's affliction obsolete. Other than semen, whose necessity biological research has not yet managed to eliminate, there is less and less said for maleness. One reads, for example, of a revival of beekeeping as a hobby. Is it surprising that many of the revivalists are women who readily explain how they admire the social structure of the hive? From the queen on down, most of the work is done by females. The drones are luxuries, grown in great numbers during prosperous times, but idle, powerless (literally with no sting), and summarily banished and left to starve or freeze as soon as the weather changes. In the post-industrial West, too, women's liberation means the ability to go anywhere and do anything, reducing masculinity to ornamental pastimes (often via tough and noisy motor vehicles) which our feckless Johns, Toms, and Brandons pursue with ever-more-desperate swagger. They may live in a midwestern backwater (which Mark Twain, I think, said would be the best place to be when the world is ending, because everything happens ten years later), but even they are by now children of their time. In one regard, however, Brandon's instincts were old-fashioned: when appealing to the ""opposite"" sex, he was all courtesy and chivalry-- and, despite having from all appearances yet to reach puberty, this approach was successful. Maybe there's hope yet.",Boys Don't Cry
108,ltj36,Against intolerance,10,31 May 2000,"When I saw the most terrifying moments of this movie (the rape and the killing of Brandon / Teena) I thought that this was a true story. So I realized that in a moment of my life, while I was sleeping or eating or studying, Brandon was going to be raped and killed. I got shocked by this and now I think that this is the best movie of the year (much more better than ""American Beauty""). Hilary Swank is fantastic as she portrays Brandon and all in this movie is so powerful, a hymn against intolerance. People must see this movie, people must understand this movie. And it would be fantastic if the sacrifice of Brandon will contribute to erase intolerance from this world.",Boys Don't Cry
109,baharuka,Badly directed movie rewriting a true story,5,25 June 2020,"I've never seen a story being changed so much in a movie and the movie would still be claimed to be based on a true story. I don't want to give spoilers but fundamental parts were changed and I was shocked when I read what really happened...I think it was a Hollywood project that went as hey, we will make a movie about a transgender person, make them look like the sole victim of an event, give them a grand love story, and...Hilary gets an Oscar!""
The scenes and the way the characters acted seemed unattached and illogical at times. I don't think that anyone could believe Hilary Swank's character was perceived as a guy by the other characters, and not just because of her looks, especially for the first half of the movie. The second part was acting-wise better and quite powerful at times, but still had the weird directing going on. The true story is really interesting and heavy, I wish they'd done service to it and developed a masterpiece.",Boys Don't Cry

Hilary Swank does a pretty good job as the main character but she is a bit too ""toothy"" like Julia Roberts and I can't help thinking they could have found a slightly more masculine actress to make the story more credible. The majority of the movie was repugnant and hard to watch - not because of the sexual stuff but because of all the trailer-park scum-of-the-earth redneck hippie rocker scumbags who inhabit the story. I just can't comfortably watch people like that who live in squalor and a world of drink and drugs and violence and who have no respect for anybody. The film was very well made and acted, but the characters were just so unwatchable to me that it detracted from the strengths of the film and I am therefore giving it a lowered score of 7/10.",Boys Don't Cry
111,mmunies,Depressing but very well put together documentary,7,30 August 2000,"I had a hard time rating this film since there were several things that depressed me about it and that I didn't like about it. I still have to admit that it was very well done, the acting was great, and the story was a fascinating one.I had a hard time relating to the white trash family in the movie. I didn't like these people overall but had sympathy with Chloe Sevigny's character.I too thought Swanks' performance was incredible - she ""acted"" very well as a male but in no way was she convincing as a male.  This is not for her lack of trying or lack of ability, though.  This was a big roadblock for me - I can normally suspend disbelief for lots of things but I couldn't believe that the characters in the movie must not have thought she was a girl. First, start with the physical aspects - she had decidedly feminine features, a small head, small hands, no shoulders and no musculature at all. Also, her mannerisms were never quite male and the way she reacted didn't seem too convincing.  I mean, I know she is just acting but I felt somehow that it was hard to believe anyone could accept her even as a feminine type guy.I felt quite depressed after this movie.  Seeing a bunch of crappy people do crappy things and knowing the protagonist will die is just kind of a bummer. Yeah, I know it's life but it doesn't mean I enjoy watching it.I'm glad I saw this movie but I will just need to remember to watch this sort of film in a more cheerful, contemplative sort of mindset.",Boys Don't Cry
112,alafolle,Quite good in a terrible sort of way,8,5 January 2001,"This is one of those films that everyone respects, but nobody enjoys watching.  ""Boys Don't Cry"" is a slow-motion train wreck of a movie that is watched with a deer-in-the-headlights sort of morbid fixation.  It's a work of art not meant to be enjoyed, but rather to be felt viscerally.  It's quite a good movie... but definitely not for the faint of heart.Director Kimberly Peirce deftly exposes the dark underbelly of small-town life, while simultaneously finding the humanity in even the most evil characters.  The villains here aren't faceless monsters, nor is the victim an innocent angel-- we see them all, for good or ill, as real people. Much of the production has an amateurish quality to it, however, with silly visual effects and melodramatic close-ups that detract from the mood. Peirce would have been wise to keep the sensationalism to a minimum and focus more on character development.  In the end, ""Boys Don't Cry"" is saved from mediocrity by the compelling tragedy of the story, and the strong performances of Hilary Swank, Chloe Sevigny, and Peter Sarsgaard.I recommend viewers watch the movie first and learn about the actual case second, as I did.  I was absolutely shocked by one of the events at the end of the movie, and the film had more of an impact on me than it would have if I'd known exactly what was going to happen.The real Teena Brandon has probably been lost forever in the dramatization of her/his life and the subsequent political crossfire.  Both the left and the right seem to be caught up in discussing gay issues and ""tolerance"". The tragedy of Teena Brandon is not one of ""intolerance"" (any guy who lies, steals, and seduces girls under false pretenses is not going to be tolerated.)  It is a tragedy of a person who was deeply unsatisfied with who she was, of a culture which labels people rather than accepting them as individuals, and of a couple of scumbags who felt that rape and murder were justifiable punishments for violating the unwritten male code of honor.",Boys Don't Cry
113,0maro0,Emotional manipulation succeeded,10,8 July 2019,"To be honest, I didn't know much about this film before watching it. I also didn't know it was biographical. Of course, I expected from it to has a good or at least an open ending. Reality, well, was stunning. I cried, a lot. The story itself is a horrible example of how inhuman, how cruel humans can act for no reason but fear of differences and desire for power. I hope someday this film won't be so relevant to current times, but today isn't such a day.
Narrative structure, visual code, the way original events were adapted and shaped into the script - all of this quite obviously meant to left the viewer crying and devastated, to make them feel compassion and sympathize with Brandon. Most of the time, I don't appreciate movies so blatantly manipulating with my feelings - there, however, it fits perfectly and works 100%. I even can't disregard this film because of how unethical authors acted with Lana's character - all the changes were necessary to make the story work, to shape it the way it is now. Though, of course, how this alternative image of someone still living affects their own identity is a question yet to answer. Could it be that movie about a person whose cultural and physical bodies are violated in the most disturbing ways, in it's own turn intrudes someone's personal borders? It's in no way on a scale of comparison, but still.
As for the rest about this film: it was really nice to see a transgender individual who is not only very confident, but at some point gets involved into romantical relationship full of love and respect. I don't know how things went in real life, but this movie at some of its moments is quite warm and reassuring. Even if circumstances are tragic, the way Brandon is presented gave me some confidence to stand my ground. Among other things, this movie also has very good cast. Hilary Swank's acting is beyond imaginable and in no way has any ""girly"" vibes that some people delusionaly pointed out in their reviews.
In conclusion, the film, despite how hard and heartbreaking it is at some points, in other moments possesses that cheesy 90-s-00s atmosphere. Which, actually, can be quite a pleasant thing at times and makes this particular film thoroughly enjoyable.",Boys Don't Cry
114,Michael Bennett Cohn,forgettable movie-of-the-week stuff,5,26 December 1999,"For those viewers who have had, or plan to have, their sex changed, this movie may provide some catharsis. But just because a story is true and sad, does not mean that it will make a good film if that film isn't arranged in a way that works dramatically. And this film isn't. It's boring and slow.I grew up in Kansas City, which is surrounded by the same type of impoverished rural towns that this story takes place in.Different strokes for different folks, but I remember driving through those places and thanking my lucky stars that I had grown up in an environment that was (relatively) more suited to helping me explore life's possibilities and become my own person (I am not a transsexual. I'm talking in generalities here.) And yet, the main character in this film, Teena Brandon, a person who needs such a fostering environment if anyone does, actively seeks to immerse herself in midwestern small-town life, probably one of the worst situations in the world in which to be thought of as a sexual deviant. While I certainly wish she hadn't been murdered, I didn't like, or have much sympathy for, her character, and try as I might, I couldn't' get very caught up in her plight, which she created for herself (I'm talking about her efforts to take on the specific male identity of Brandon Teena in that specific situation, not her desire to be a man in general) and then hung on to with all her strength until it killed her. Other than her kleptomania, we know almost nothing about Teena's personality besides her gender issues. And if that's the only aspect of her personality worth mentioning, well...then I'm even less interested in her.",Boys Don't Cry

The love scenes are fascinating, did the real character do that and get away with it?Hilary Swank's performance was outstanding.  But what a screwed up character the real person must have been, what a shame.  However, I couldn't help but think all the way through the film as I watched Brandon mess up more and more due to inaction, or the wrong action, what an ugly woman Hilary must be to be able to pull off this role so convincingly.  Acting aside, she really looked like a boy.  There was only a few places where her voice went up into clearly female registers.  I wondered how it was possible she got away with it for so long.The most interesting character, however, is not Brandon.  It's Lana.  The small town beauty who wants to get out of town and falls in love with Brandon the boy.  But when she finds out that Brandson is Brandon the girl, nothing changes.  And I can't see how that can be as she is clearly not a lesbian!The supporting cast is wonderful.

117,pmullinsj,Useless as a feature film. The documentary was infinitely better,1,29 January 2006,"This has been recommended by countless people, but the story contains nothing worth making into a film. It is a sad story, full of weak people--all of them. The documentary on Brandon Teena is much more useful for something that needs facts, not romanticizing.The main character is not even particularly sympathetic herself, and there is no way the story could have been of interest to anyone unless she had been murdered. A 'successful' Brandon Teena would not have captured people's sympathy.The reason I find her completely unsympathetic is not because of her sexual confusion, but because it did not follow that it was okay to use dildoes on girls in actual sex, tricking them into thinking it was the usual member. In the documentary, some of these girls are so ignorant they still claim it was 'real.' Given that the whole milieu is as redneck as possible, it is (while not at all excusable even so) unsurprising that the murder would have occurred, once her identity was discovered by piglike young men.The one possible use of this film is to make you look into the story itself, and to see this very beleaguered impoverished low-life tragedy, which perhaps one might not have done with the documentary alone. So that the semi-fiction film publicizes a story that is not worth dramatizing, but does lead some of us (who were mystified at the way it was celebrated as something important, which it certainly is not) to find the documentary and learn a bit more about these half-literate people we usually associate with the South a little more than the Midwest. Maybe it puts Nebraska on the map. Again, the story itself is very sad and moving, but it is only meaningful as a piece of filmed journalism, which the documentary provides.It doesn't matter to me who gets Oscars, so if Hilary Swank has 2 that's fine with me, even though I thought her performance was perfectly suited to this mostly meaningless film (therefore quite like it.) The Oscars mean so little: Garbo never got one, nor did Deborah Kerr or Robert Mitchum or Marilyn Monroe (whom they never even had sense enough to nominate) and Hilary Swank got 2. Katharine Hepburn got 4, only 2 of which were truly as 'deserving,' if that word can be used for these ignominious awards, as some of her greater roles, such as 'Long Day's Journey Into Night.' That says it all to me. I think Hilary Swank should get 5 Oscars, given how absurd they are.",Boys Don't Cry

Folks like her have to have an unsurmountable amount of nerve in order to reveal themselves.No matter what you think about them, don't ever think gay folks don't have guts.If you were gay, would you have enough guts to tell folks you were? I for one wouldn't. I'm too much of a coward, not like the gay folks who have come out of the so called closet. These folks deserve admiration, not disgrace.Teena brandon was killed for no more reason than that a couple of misanthropic sons of bitches couldn't accept her as she was.I cried for half an hour after she was killed. As a matter of fact there are tears in my eyes as I Write this.I've seen actual pictures of her in death. They are unspeakable. I realize I haven't said a lot about the movie so far. Hilary Swank couldn't have played her part with more perfection. The entire cast was perfect, right down to the sorry bastards who killed her. This is in my opinion one of the most important movies of our times. It's a movie for anyone who has never understood gay people.

119,up2u,The Bluest Eyes in Texas,10,15 November 2004,"This explosively powerful film is easily the best film debut since ""12 Angry Men"" (1957), and it also the best movie of 1999, hands down. The story ofBrandon Teena, nee Teena Brandon, a Nebraska woman who set out to fulfillher dream of living as a man, must have been nearly impossible to tell. After her identity was found out by her ""friends"" shortly after her twenty-first birthday, they raped and killed her, as well as the friends she was staying with. This savage hate crime was smeared all over the tabloids and looked as if it were doomed to become a diluted TV-movie of the week. Thank God for director/co-writer Kimberly Peirce. She miraculously strips away all the sensationalism to bring Falls City, NE and its residents to life so vividly that its nearly surreal. This is not a movie with witty one-liners and a chunky screenplay filled with big ideas, but this is one of those rare films that celebrates the human spirit with none of the sentimentality of swill like ""Life Is Beautiful"" or ""A Beautiful Mind"". Even better, Peirce transcends matters ofgender identity and captures the essence of Brandon's soul (incarnated byHilary Swank in an Oscar-winning tour de force), yearning to be its true self. What is beautiful about the relationship that Brandon found with Lana Tisdel(the equally mesmerizing Chloe Sevigny) is that Lana is far more intelligent and spiritually evolved than her family and friends. She recognizes that Teena is both male and female; not ""a man trapped in a woman's body"", but a personwho has risen above the limitations she was born with. Although the last half- hour of the film, which unflinchingly depicts Brandon's rape and murder is nearly unwatchable, Peirce and co-writer Andy Bienen still manage to end on ahopeful note. They depict with stunning clarity the meeting and lovemaking of not just bodies, but hearts and minds. Teena Brandon was too beautiful a spirit to survive amidst the cruelty in America's heartland, but in Lana Tisdel shefound someone she could soar with, however briefly. Brandon Teena had thecourage to be himself, and Lana Tisdel has the courage to be herself. God bless them both, and God bless the cast and crew of ""Boys Don't Cry"".",Boys Don't Cry

124,sergicaballeroalsina,Art as the pursuit of truth,9,12 September 2018,"According to Bertrand Russell, Art is a pursuit of truth. This is an indie jewel that finds in truth its best ally.
Realistic cinema, heir of Cassavettes, with minimal artifices and simple aesthetics. Its atmosphere and photography transports us very truthfully to the environment in which the story unfolds. It does not seem to me a movie about the rights of transgender or intersex people. Nor about any personal struggle. This is a full-time community tragedy. It is neither a beautiful movie. Its artistic language is in tune with the disenchantment of an absolutely hostile social reality. All the characters are circumscribed to a ""too real"" cultural environment, of non-existent opportunities. A spectrum of our society striken by precariousness, ugliness, addictions and crime. All of them are victims of their reality.
The whole cast nails it portraying a social fragment, one among many, in which everyone feels disgust for their life. A drama filled with dirt and disappointment in which the main characters see a very small light in their relationship. A loophole, an illusion. What hopes does a transgender person have in such an environment? The same as the others: none. And it will be sacrificed.
Why would we want to contemplate a portrait that does not really have any kind of appeal? I think that Hilary Swank and her brave construction of the main character have everything to blame. She takes the actor's work to the limit. The most extremely honest performance I have ever seen. I feel grateful that there is such a movie. That Art pursues the truth so closely.",Boys Don't Cry

I got some very mixed feelings about this film, both disgust from the erratic violent scenes and the behavior, and still this enchanting feeling. Hilly Swank holds the atmosphere high and alive, pulling off playing a boy, making the movie interesting even from the start, as a character who's struggling as a trans gendered teen who wants to fit in, you start to like the character for every second. And the beautiful, troubling, emotionally disturbed Lana Tisdel, played by 'Chloë Sevigny' , who shared these intimate scenes with Hilary, which were erotic and wonderful to watch, the director composer and both the actors really made the scene spark. However, i didn't value the shifting between the mode towards the end, which was shifting way too fast.

130,frezeframe,Beautiful dysfunction,9,14 May 2013,"Boys don't cry is an amazing piece of film history. Aside from being a historical acting performance- (Hillary Swank best actress Academy Award), this film is of the most daring, courageous films ever made. For director Kimberly Peirce to keep this story together, and for all these actors to have the courage sign on to this, and give such committed performances... it's a wonderful dance to watch. Truly a must see film. It's intense and hard to watch at times; but it does what few films do. It takes you on a ride- it keeps you guessing; it makes you love, hate, laugh and cry. This is the true story of a trans-gender female turning male named Tina Brandon (played by Hillary Swank). Brandon, running from his past, moves to a small town in Nebraska and manages to convince his peers that he is a male. He falls for a girl named Lana (Chloe Sevigny). The love between Hillary Swank and Chloe Sevigny is real. It's innocent, it's dysfunctional, it's sensual, and sexual (Brandon makes love to her using a fake penis- and actually pulls it off! no pun intended). You feel bad for Lana because she's being lied to, and you feel bad for Brandon at the same time because you know their love is real- and you know the truth and Brandon's past is going to get found out sooner or later. Despite all the tension, you feel happy for them because they're both experiencing something real, regardless of what the truth is. But you're also scared for them because there are dangerous people in their immediate surroundings. Brandon is the outsider into Lana's volatile, low income family and peers. When Brandon is detained for charges that arose prior to his relocation, he is placed in the women's section of the Falls City prison. Lana bails him out and asks why he was in the women's prison. He lies again saying he's a hermaphrodite- but Lana declares her love for him no matter what he is. But the word is out on Tina Brandon in the newspaper, and suspicions arise among local homophobic, neurotic, maniacs who are determined to find out the truth, regardless of anyone's happiness. One of the main threads of this film is embarrassment. You fear for Brandon. You know what she's doing is wrong, but you really don't want her to get caught. She is so genuine as Brandon. You really feel for her/him. You completely accept Hillary Swank as a young man. No need to explain the climax or more details of this intricate plot, as this is a must see film.

The director Kimberly Pierce, I believe, (sp?) has quite an interesting and not altogether predictable take on this very unpleasant true tale. Its a tiny bit repetitive but some of it's completely hypnotic. The film is also helped considerably by the subtle Hilary Swank as Brandon. Her performance here is certainly a fine one and it makes you think... How many other really good actors are wasted on crappy TV shows like 90210 or bad films like Karate Kid sequels? Its possible that there's other undiscovered contenders wasting away with bad scripts and dull roles. How many actors never get a chance to cut their teeth on a truly interesting character?

Whereas most of the year's best movies touch upon weirdness in the urban/suburban American society familiar to folks like me, Boys Don't Cry is set in the hell-hole of Falls City, Nebraska. We are presented the gut-wrenching and sadly true tale of a young woman (Hilary Swank, who won't be unknown after this Oscar-worthy performance) who looks, feels and acts just like a dude -- a fearless and charismatic little dude from a bad home with a yearning for love and acceptance. The object of his desire, a bored young babe named Lana, is played magnificently by yet another budding star, Chloë Sevigny.The work of yet another first-time director, Kimberly Peirce, all aspects of this film -- particularly the dialogue, cinematography and acting -- are first rate, although one might argue that it could have been about ten minutes shorter. Peirce (who also co-wrote) evidently allowed herself a measure of artistic license in developing the screenplay, but I am glad that she left plenty of warts on Swank's gender-confused character rather than setting her up as an unrealistic martyr. I found it easy to view Boys Don't Cry at the ""Dr. Laura Level"" (i.e., a horrific fate is destined to befall compulsive liars who hang out with sick people and thrive on committing dangerous acts), but my more powerful reaction was admiration for the bravery, humor and basic human dignity the two main characters somehow maintained in a poisonous small-town environment that would make Jerry Springer wince.

I respect the writers for this.  Though I knew I was watching a movie, in a way I felt like I was watching life, if that statement is understandable.  Although I do not support the lifestyle Brandon Teena lived, I still can feel nothing but complete sympathy for this human being.  Just because I don't condone homosexuality and things of that nature, I feel as though it is the person's choice and they should be able to live just as any other human being should. Having said that, I must also say this:  I have not researched the story of Brandon Teena and know only what I've seen on television and movies.  I am going by the story I heard and believe.  Enough about the actual event, about the movie.  I think that writers of this film did a great job of making one feel sympathetic toward Brandon without making her look like she was a perfect person.  They presented the story from an outside view without taking sides, leaving the viewer to make the decision.  I think the cast as a whole did an excellent job, especially Hilary Swank and Chloe Sevigny. Swank is now one of my favorite actresses.  I give this movie a 10.",Boys Don't Cry

As the highways of the midwest are supplanted in speeded film with a starry night (a touching effect), the main character's lives are just like them. Moving too fast but not going anywhere, but it sure is beautiful but in an emotionally devestating way. Of the movies I have viewn none has been as touchingly romantic yet also so engrossingly about ""life"" as this one.Our protagonist is Brandon Teena or Teena Brandon, a midwestern Transsexual but that not being his/her defining trait. Teena is the product of a lonesome, deliquint and relatively stationary childhood, admitting that she/he never has left the Lincoln area let alone Nebraska. We meet Teena just after she has gone on a date and is skimping out on a court date. Soon she heads to a town so small that it is not on the map and becomes ingratiated with a family, involving ex-cons and falls in love but in a way that is so viscerally desperate yet unadulterdly emotional that truly it is one of the most realistically powerful romances ever felt on screen. I do not exaggerate when I saw it captures the real emotion of that type of love unlike any other film out there.What happens is inevitable, considering its based on an actual story, yet the romance is so beautiful and so true, it almost feels as if the film enters into a realm beneath the material. It's still amazing, but a part of me thinks that the story may have been better suited had it opted to coda in a different way. It almost feels as though a film that is American ""slice-of-life"" in the greatest of ways moves into a different genre and though it is still superb filmaking, I could have imagined it as something that in style fit more with what had come before it.",Boys Don't Cry

136,Nikos-12,"Beautiful, moving and highly disturbing",9,28 May 2000,"Based on a true story (words that usually strike fear into the hearts of critics and audiences alike), Boys Don't Cry is the tale of Brandon Teena (Hilary Swank), a young man from the tiny town of Lincoln, Nebraska, who is, in fact, a woman. Born Teena Brandon and in and out of trouble with the law his whole life, Brandon had a serious problem with his sexual identity, which led to a life on the run from irate and confused people. The girls he seduced described him as the best boyfriend they ever had, and this film, the result of extensive research by director and co-writer Kimberley Pierce, tells his story.Kicked out by his brother, Brandon goes on a drinking binge and ends up going off into the night with the kind-hearted Candace (Alicia Goranson) and her big brother John (Peter Sarsgaard). He ends up staying with them and their friends in the backwater of Falls City. There he falls for a depressed local girl, Lana (Chloë Sevigny), who is similarly enchanted by Brandon's dreams and romantic nature. Their innocent love affair is beautifully drawn against the endless skies and ramshackle houses of the American Mid-West, with Pierce's hypnotic time-lapse photography capturing perfectly the lack of a sense of time passing. Inevitably, though, with the law and Lana's family getting closer to Brandon's true identity, events spiral towards a horrible, harrowing conclusion.Pierce has undoubtedly created something exceptional here. Her camera never turns away from the terrible events it witnesses and this makes the touching central relationship even more affecting. The entire cast are brilliant, portraying the bored frustration of small town teenagers with intense commitment. It is Swank and Sevigny that stand out, though, their characters giving warmth and beauty to a cold, hard landscape.",Boys Don't Cry

It was one of the most alarming and important films of the year, Swank's performance as the young 'boy' Brandon Teena is a star-making turn, the centers and foundation of Kimberly Peirce's startling debut film. Chloe Sevigny who plays Lana (who falls in love with Brandon, thinking she's a man) is also top-noth as Swank's partner. The duo are a love story for the millennium, a mismatched couple that find perfection in imperfection. The two leads boast outstanding performances, Hilary Swank was just mesmerizing as Brandon, I shower her performance in praise, she sharply plays a character full of complexity. And Chloe Sevigny (who I have been a fan of ever since I was her in 1995's ""Kids""), who was especially fine, as deserves as much praise as Hilary, Chloe (I feel) also deserved the Oscar for Best Supporting Actress. She was just perfect and probably the only one capable of playing a frustrated teenager with a dead-end job in a tiny town. A teenager who has never been treated with sensitivity and respect. Who has never experienced real intimacy. Her performance burnt into my memory and will stay there. The screenplay by Peirce and Andy Bienen challenges us to take a hard look at role-playing in society. Pierce vividly conveys the excitement, the violence and strong danger in Brandon's gender-bending adventure.A truly unmissable film, beautifully made but not for the light-hearted or those that are easily offended (the film is often extraordinarily tough to watch at some points).

138,behemuthm,This was a hyped-up piece of garbage.,1,20 June 2000,"First off, I am a *very* liberal person, and my best friend of 15 years is gay, so it would be fair to say that I am in no way prejudice against gays. However, it is fairly obvious that the subject matter of this film rather than the substance (or lack thereof) is the topic of much acclaim. Hilary Swank did nothing to convince me that she deserved the Best Actress Oscar for her performance. Same thing happened last year with Gwyneth Paltrow in Shakespeare in Love. I suppose Hollywood was simply scared into *not* disliking this film, thus thrusting it into the spotlight and making everyone who didn't like it feel prejudice and ignorant. It's like making a film with gay characters is guaranteed success because the film industry is too timid to shake it's finger at such ""originality and bold filmmaking.""This movie was absolutely horrible to watch. The story is incoherent at best, and the whole ""two-girls-finding-love-in-an-evil-man-infested-world-that-are-punished-for- their-love"" idea has already been done innumerous times, so the sentiment that this film is so unique and bold and new is bull. I don't care if this was based on a true story. For heaven's sake, don't use Hilary Swank to play someone who is supposed to be mistaken for a guy! I mean, how ignorant can these people be? I'm willing to bet that the real Teena Brandon was much more masculine in her appearance. The fact that all the men who are in this film are portrayed as fat, stupid, and evil simply added to the absurdity of this movie.Kimberly Peirce is an obvious man-hater and it shows very clearly in her directing. And Tracy Granger, I'm sorry, but you have to be one of the worst editors ever in film. Where's the concept of continuity? This film jumps around so much that all you end up getting is one simpathetic look at Swank after another. I'm sure that the public agrees for the most part on this since it pretty much bombed at the box office and nobody is really renting it.

We are given the opportunity to have an unfiltered view - in essence a ""real"" look -- at the strange and unfamiliar world of transgenderism, as well as the bigotry of the surrounding world.

It tells the true and tragic story of Teena Brandon/Brandon Teena, a woman living as a man in a small town in Nebraska. No matter what your personal opinions may be, this film does not preach. It tells the story in a matter-of-fact, honest and gritty way, but leaves you shaking your head in shock that such anger and hatred exists in these modern times, for someone who is ""different"" merely because of their sexual preference.Relative newcomer Hilary Swank gives a heartfelt and courageous performance as Brandon. I say courageous not only because of the subject matter, but also because she is able to strip away her youthful, movie star glamour and become the character she plays. She is entirely convincing. Also, she shows a tremendous amount of guts for being able to get through the gut-wrenchingly violent rape scene. This was a brave choice, and a wise one.Chloe Sevigny plays Lana, the girl Brandon loves. She is the only person who truly understands Brandon. Brandon finds himself in a world of drunken trailer trash and convicted felons. No one is free from guilt, but there is always the unspoken sin of being different. Hilary Swank and Chloe Sevigny play their tastefully erotic love scenes without seeming self-conscious. So many actors of their generation might be afraid to tackle these types of roles, but they do their jobs with aplomb.The film was another that haunted me the day after seeing it. Kimberly Peirce manages to make a simple film about a very difficult subject, and she doesn't resort to Hollywood gloss or preachiness.

OH WAIT!  that's right, every hollywood movie has the awkward sex scene or the slow motion scenes of horror in which people scream ""NOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!"" Well, so does this incredibly disappointing movie.  The story is told straight with little exploration of gender roles and a lot of pandering to lesbian women.  I expect that from a big budget movie, but an independant is supposed to be free of such garbage. So what we have is the worst of both worlds.  All the poor production value of an independant with all of the non-artistic pandering of a big-budget. Despite this, Chloe Sevigny manages to turn in a very nice performance.

I recently was able to acquire a physical copy a few weeks ago and decided to give my more adult mind a second watch of this film. It is STILL as disturbing and gruesome as I remember.Back then, I also didnt know this movie was based off real life events which made my stomach sink even further. The Brandon Teena story is truly one of epically sad proportions.The film accurately depicts Brandon Teena and all the events that lead to her murder along with two others. Mr. Devine, the third murdered, was not mentioned in the movie for whatever reason but still everything hits you very hard. The sad fact is that this WAS the reality back in those times. No one understood what it meant to be transgender or anything outside the norm. This of course led to hate crimes but the Brandon Teena case just hits extra hard given how lively and bright spirited he was and how horrifically aweful his final days were. Not to mention the other victims who just were in the wrong place at the wrong time and lost their lives as well. All in front of a toddler who thankfully was spared.Hilary Swank does justice and a half to Brandon Teena. This story is one that needed to be shared to bring attention to this topic on a national level as dreadful as it is.

144,babybink,Truly Exceptional,10,12 October 1999,"This film is easily one of the most impressive and sure-handed directing debuts I have ever seen, and one of the finest films of the year. Pierce captures the Midwest in its garish glory (unlike its white trash cousin, ""Gummo"", which blanched out its landscape like a wasteland) and loads it with beer, highways, sky, cigarettes, guitar rock, and rage. The script deftly manages to round out potentially cardboard characters with little or no confessional or sentimentality -- the players don't reveal anything that is not necessary, leaving an air of mystery to everyone, not just the strange hero. The young cast (except the actress playing Lana's mom, whose excellent performance should not be overlooked) manages the emotionally charged and incredibly intense material almost effortlessly, without crossing the line into exploitation or camp (even the brutal violence in the film, which I might consider exploitative in other films, is unfortunately quite appropriate here). Swank should be applauded for her portrayal of the confused and hungry Brandon, as should Sevigny, for turning a white trash Juliet character into someone multi-faceted and real. Becky from 'Roseanne' puts her acting experience to good use and does a fine job as well, as do Saarsgard and Sexton, who is almost unrecognizeable here.Although the film is difficult to watch at times, it is an incredibly told story, and should not be missed.",Boys Don't Cry

But the crisis of identity, which is the central tension of the film, extends beyond Swank's sexually confused character to just about everyone who crosses his or her path. None of the characters - from the young, single mom tending bar and trying to survive to the restless teenage girl to the ex-convicts who inhabit this Oklahoma backwater town - have a clue about who they are and what they should be doing. Familial relations get so out of whack that one girl's mother simply gets the name ""Mom,"" and everyone is free to call her that. She doesn't get a name so much as a definition.

Not only does she pass as a believable young male, but she gives depth and sensitivity to the troubled hero/heroine.  It will be a major shock if Swank isn't rewarded with the Oscar for Best Actress.Equally deserving of a Supporting award is Chloe Sevigny, who plays Brandon's loyal lover.  Together they provide a sexual intensity not often found in American movies.This is a disturbing film that will linger with you long after the final scenes.  Don't expect the Academy to nominate it as Best film.

148,Jackkrsk,"""The first time I watched this film, I was so impressed by the powerful acting of the characters.""",10,30 July 2013,"Boys Don't Cry (which was release on October 8, 1999) has an heartbreaking true life story about Brandon Teena, who is a transgender-man (female-to-male non-operative transgender man). The picture explores the themes of freedom, courage, identity and empowerment. The film was directed and written by an (previously) unknown female film director Kimberley Price. The movie title was actually named after a song of the same name by an English rock band called The Cure. It's a of those films involving a same-sex relationship - just like Brokeback Mountain (2005).Hilary Swank is a ""down-to-earth"" movie actress who portrayed the role as Brandon Teena. Here's an interesting fact about her role: To prepare for the role, she lived her life as a man for about a month, including wrapping her chest in tension bandages and putting socks down the front of her pants much the same way that Brandon Teena did. I believe this is the main reason why her portrayal was so outstanding. Boys Don't Cry was the film that made Hilary Swank into Hollywood stardom.Her performance in this film earned her first Oscar for best actress. She deserved it.This is a true story about Brandon Teena and it takes place in 1993. He is the popular new dude in the small Nebraska town of Falls City. He hangs out with the guys, drinking, cussing, and bumper surfing, and he charms the young women, who've never met a more sensitive and considerate young man. He even loves hanging out in gas stations and roller rinks. Life is pretty good for Brandon now that he's one of the guys. He also develops a relationship with a blonde beauty named Lana Tisdel (played by Chloe Sevigny). However, he doesn't mention to his friends and girlfriend that he is actually a trans man. Later in the film, his friends discover that Brandon is actually a woman. He is brutally raped and beaten by two of his friends (which of course actually happened and it doesn't count as a spoiler if anybody has heard about Brandon Teena's story). Her life, as shown in the movie, became tormented (If you are wondering about the torment, you all have to watch the full movie for yourselves). There is a scene in the film that employs a great cinematography structure technique inspired by a scene from Victor Fleming's"" The Wizard of OZ (1939)"". In the Oz film, the cinematography structure technique is in the scene where Dorothy exits her house and steps into Munchkin land. In Boys Don't Cry, the technique is reflected in the scene in which the audience see Brandon Teena enter a roller rink and the song ""Just the Way That I Needed"" by The Cars is playing. After a shot of the character, he then seen walking through the door. The viewer sees the door opening; the character goes through, the door, and the viewer go through the door. The way that they used this cinematography technique is really fascinating due to the cinematic inspiration.The first time I watched this movie, I was so impressed by the powerful acting of the characters. The skills of the main cast playing really make the movie. Any great film based on a true story should always hire actors and actresses with great acting talent and skills. If an actor or actress doesn't have the necessary skills, the role could turn out badly - just like Faye Dunaway's (even though I still think she is an amazing actress) role as Joan Crawford in ""Mommy Dearest (1981)"".Boys Don't Cry is undoubtedly eighth best film of 1999 on my list of top ten best films of 1999. The story in the film was specifically and wonderfully written by Kimberly Price. The film depicts very well a true life story, just like several other true life depictions in: ""Malcolm X"", ""Ray"", ""Alive"",""Lincoln"", and ""Raging Bull"". ""I highly recommend this movie for people, who like movies such as Brokeback Mountain and especially films that are based on true stories"".""

Unlike ""The Messenger,"" however, ""Boys Don't Cry"" is a brilliant film, disturbing in how well it depicts the fragility of self and the innocence of the belief one has in those one loves (the blindness with which Lana sees her ""man"").

As an accurate portrayal of the real people and events, not so much. I don't know why Hollywood feels they must change the facts, when they present a treatment of real life people. It is disrespectful of the real life people, who must feel abused by how they are portrayed, and I think the audience. Surely we can be shown the truth, and make up our own mind, without being manipulated into how we perceive the people, and the things they did.I have watched this movie on multiple occasions, and again, as a work of fiction, portrays the awful personal and external issues that real life minorities have to face, just by being themselves. For a heterosexual male myself, it does help to open the mind, and not just tolerate, but accept others. Hopefully we all want to move further in this direction.But what about what really happened, and who the individuals really were? I think it would have made an even more compelling story, and if handled well, still would have allowed us to feel empathy for Brandon.I have done some research, and as limited and perhaps biased as it could have been presented;Brandon appears to have been a serial womaniser, as he tried to work out how to live his life. At 18yrs old he hooked up with a 13yr old girl and a 14yr old girl, never being totally honest with them, their family, or other young girls he attracted. He then continued to initiate romances with many young women, without being able to be totally honest with them, which while being damaging and unfair to others, can be understood.Lana Tisdel, her unmentioned sister Leslie, and their mother as shown in the movie, seem to have a cloud hanging over their head in perhaps telling the murderers where Brandon was, and not calling Brandon to let them know that trouble was coming on that night. They are flawed individuals, but to be fair, this is displayed during the movie to some extent.My biggest issue is that Lisa Lambert, a former girl friend of Brandon, is used as a composite character in the movie. Brandon had ended a relationship with Lisa, but Lisa allowed Brandon to stay at her house, in his time of need. She lost her life, shot in the head, as a result of this kindness. And, then there is Phillip DeVine. A young black man, who appears to have overcome an horrific early health issue and physical handicap, and was on the way to a good life, before he met and feel for Leslie, got dumped, and also tragically found himself at the house that night, and was murdered. Phillip is not mentioned in the movie at all, even as a composite character.So again, as it is, a very good movie that helps us to open our minds. But why not do justice to the real people involved.",Boys Don't Cry
157,MikeG-1221,"A good film, but not fully realized.",7,26 August 2001,"I had heard a lot about this movie, and my girlfriend was a very big fan of the film, so I was looking forward to it. I thought it was good, but I felt like there were some things missing.First of all, the positives. Hilary Swank and Chloe Sevigny both give very good performances. I'm not really sure that either performance is ""Oscarworthy"", as many people have said, but they both fall into their characters and make you believe in what they're doing. The other performances were also very good. The other positive was how the director caught the feel of the helplessness of Falls City (the town where this takes place). The dark, moody lighting and the decay that seemed to surround their lives was the perfect backdrop for the film.However, the film does have problems. Brandon Teena's story is not fully explained. Unless you are aware of her story, you don't know how she wound up becoming sexually confused, and a little more explanation of this would have been helpful. The other problem I had was with the pacing. As a lot of people on the comments board have noted, this movie is very slow. Some movies are slow in that they build up to something, but the pacing in this movie is very bad. The writer probably intended to give you an idea of what a nothing existence there is in Falls City, but instead it makes you wonder when the payoff is coming.But it is a good movie. It makes you think about homosexuality in Middle America, which is definitely something worth thinking about and not ignoring. I do get the feeling that this movie was made for people who are A)very knowledgeable about the Brandon Teena story and B) very sympathetic to her and to homosexual issues in general. However, the film isn't exclusionary or limited in that way. It did need to be a little more fleshed out, though, to truly make it a four-star movie, which this film wasn't. 7/10.",Boys Don't Cry
158,Moviemaniacgirl-1,Gritty and Honest: Boys Should Cry,9,8 August 2011,"Nothing short of full blown heart wrenching, pit-of-the-stomach empathetic cinema, and it's all possible because of the uncompromising and unsurpassed Kimberly Peirce and Hilary Swank. The striking story of a man, who was tragically born a woman, flows through the actors with ease and a disturbingly coarse elegance. Brandon Teena, Hilary Swank's finest more pure role to date, is a dimensional and wholly real character; complete with cracks and sharp edges. Using simplistic expression and body language to become a man, Swank managed to defy audiences and actually BE a man for most of the duration of the film. The impact and force of Swank's emotions drove the entire story and formed a pragmatic relationship with Chloe Sevigny's Lana. Sevigny, commonly known for her off-the-cuff indie roles, broke down all the walls of ""supporting"" character, and stood resolutely against the back-drop of Nebraska—freed, broken, gorgeous, ordinary, delicate, bursting. When mentioning those snubbed at the Oscars, Sevigny should always be listed primarily, not only because she created a character so wretchedly real, but because she was still the angelic force, the unfamiliar loveliness, that kept the film so exclusively mystic and magical. Down to earth and exceptionally betraying, the film's tone manages to never stray from authenticity; either a soft enjoyment of romance, or a pounding fury with life's futility. No matter what is being felt, it is being experienced by the audience too. Peter Sarsgard, Brandan Sexton, Alison Folland, Alicia Goranson, and Jeanetta Arnette all deserve their individual sentences, whether describing how masterfully they manage to terrify or how innocently they evoke tenderness, but my skipping over their descriptions simply means they are too intricate and individual to express. Without the charming and harrowing screenplay there would be no brilliance to discuss, no heart-break to mend, but beyond this, without Kimberly Peirce there would be no ""Boys Don't Cry"". Her devotion to the complete portrayal of Brandon was the ultimate success of the film. Not once did she compromise the character's emotional state, rather she found an array of images and framing choices to complete what would have otherwise been campy or simply ""B"". Moments of complete immersion in Lana and Brandon's love were left rolling; not cut for censorship, but shown for what it was. Peirce made the film whole, and let the audience revel in what a boy is. Overall, ""Boys Don't Cry"" was a work of character, not simply the perfection created by Swank and Sevingy, but the work of all the film's gifted actors and perceptive director. A must see film for every child who is confused, for every adult with a prejudice, for every person who has ever loved a film, and for anyone who needs to be shown a gritty and ingenuous honesty.",Boys Don't Cry

The acting by all the cast is just magnificent; which you have to give credit to Kimberly Pierce. Hilary Swank gave a performance that took guts from every aspect possible.

Actually, I watched the film before informing myself here on IMDb and should have done it, apparently, to understand it better. If you watch the film without any background information, you are thrown in cold in a person's life and destiny that is completely unbelievable, unlikely and utterly disturbing. Here actually lies my point of criticism: This movie does NOT explain, WHY Brandon is like he/she is. Where does this condition come from, what has happened to her/him? The film should have started earlier to put us in the picture. It would have been much more convincing, had we been given the chance to see a ""more feminine"" character first. Or get some sort of empathy. For a person with ""normal"" sexual orientation, it is virtually impossible to relate to Brandon's behaviour, in my humble opinion. I was left shaking my head more than once thinking: ""a person behaving like that calls for trouble"". Why couldn't Brandon have been more discreet? Why so blatantly offend those small-town hillbillies? He/she must have known that stupid country people cannot relate to persons behaving otherwise than according to fixed, pre-established behavioural patterns. In a big city you do what you want, but in the countryside, stay low-key, for heaven's sake.Aside from this, Hilary Swank's performance was astounding and small wonder she won a deserved Oscar. I consider Hilary Swank to be one of the most beautiful women in the world, by the way.",Boys Don't Cry

165,MrJerry,One of the best movies of 1999,10,10 July 2001,"Boys Don't Cry is a superb telling of what is sadly,a true story and is a great example of a great movie not always having the biggest names in its cast.When I saw this movie in the theater the day before the 1999 Oscars,I thought to myself afterwards,""Don't be surprised if Hilary Swank won the Best Actress Oscar for this one.""As it was,she deservedly won it.She truly looked and acted like a man in this movie. This movie did not shy away from Brandon Teena's past criminal history as Teena Brandon.When one watches this movie,one is drawn into an almost hypnotic state into where Brandon's girlfriend Lana Tisdel (superbly played by Chloe Sevigny,nominated for the Best Supporting Actress Oscar) is a woman who does not ask many questions and truly accepts who Brandon is,even after she finds out that she is a woman in a sexual identity crisis preferring her identity as a man.Peter Saarsgard and Brendon Sexton III are absolutely chilling as the killers of Brandon and 2 other people.The murder sequence that followed Brandon's rape and subsequent police report is probably one of the most chilling ending murder sequences in a movie since the ending of ""Looking For Mr. Goodbar.""Also turning up in this movie is one of those actresses where one wonders,""Didn't I see her before for a long time on television?""-Alicia Goranson(formerly of the TV show, ""Roseanne"".).Overall,this is a superb movie about a very courageous woman who had the courage to pass as a man and sadly, paid the ultimate price once her deception was found out.One also feels for Lisa and Phillip,the 2 others murdered with Brandon.The love sequences between Hilary Swank and Chloe Sevigny were also handled very well.As nice to the women as Brandon was,it is little wonder that Lana loved him so much.I give this movie a rating of 10 out of 10.It is one of 1999's best movies in a year that had a number of very well done movies.",Boys Don't Cry

Her role as a transgender was obviously very difficult to portray, but she did an outstanding job. The movie was very traumatic and upsetting.

A Film that Dares to be REAL!,9,28 December 2001,"*******************CONTAINS SPOILERS******************************Films which do not hide the horrors of real life crimes are few, and it is refreshing to see that the director of ""Boys Don't Cry"" has not shyed away from exposing what really happened to Brandon Teena. People may say the film is too graphic, however I believe Peirce should be commended for the realistic portrayal of Brandons life and, ultimately, his death. Hilary Swank stars as the young Brandon Teena, a woman (physiologically) who desperatly wishes to be a male and who lives everyday life as one. Her Oscar for her portrayal is well deserved and she is supported by fine performances by Chloe Sevigny, Peter Sarsgaard and Jeanneta Arnette. Sevigny, in particular, is remarkable as Lana, the girl who falls in love with Brandon, not knowing that Brandon is physically a female. When watching this film, and particulary during the violent or graphic scenes, remind yourself that this is a film based on a true story, and I guarantee you won't be able to stop your tears.",Boys Don't Cry

Hiliary Swank is marvelous, if not particularly masculine, and Chole Sevigny makes you wish she was in more films- but you literally can't see them.The movie comes alive when Brandon is ""outed"" as a woman. The last half hour is a s brutal and unforgiving a piece of film making as you will ever see, slamming home the point that ""gender crisis/confusion"" not only exists as a reality but can end lives. The rape is not graphic but is more upsetting than any other I can think of simply because it is completely unsettled and reflects a real event. watch this and you will learn a lot about a section of society normally dismissed as ""freaks"" and about the deeply confused and ignorant reactions they can create.",Boys Don't Cry

Teena dresses as a boy, cuts her hair and stuffs socks in her underpants, and can pass as a boy. she fools a group of friends living in new falls, Nebraska, and she dates, and has sex with Lana Tisdel. Lana is the obsession of John. John, her ex boyfriend and his friend tom are friends of Teena. Teena goes to jail for forgery, and while she is in jail, the sh*t hits the fan. they find tampons and a dildo in her bag, and when she comes home with Lana, she realizes what they have done. Lana takes her into her bedroom saying she'll check whats in Teena's pants, but she comes out saying Teena's a boy, not checking. john takes her into the bathroom later with tom and pulls down her pants to expose her for what she really is: a girl. he tells Lana to look, she struggles, but when she sees, she doesn't care that Teena's a girl. she loves her. john and tom let Teena go, but when she leaves, they are outside, and they take her to an alley. and rape her.The rape scene made me cry. it's hard to make me cry in a movie, but i cried. during the rape scene, it was a cross-over, she was telling it to a police officer. it was just....o my god. she was saying it through tears, and it was the best acting i've ever scene. the raping was so intense, they both did it, against the car and in the car, and it just made me appreciate everything i had: in that one moment. and after the raping, they are being nice to her again. it was odd, they asked her not to tell anyone, so she immediately tells Lana. after a few days, john comes hunting for Teena.Teena is staying at Candice's house and they go there. after promising Lana they could go to Teena's house in Lincoln and start a new life. but their dream was cut short when john and tom drove to Candice's house and found Teena. she was shot in the neck, and Candice was shot in the head. they spared Lana.one of the best movies i have ever seen, Boys Don't Cry is an extremely moving piece of cinema that should be more acknowledged.

174,hisown,One of the most important movies of the decade...,10,5 September 2005,"This is a very important movie and I recommend it to anyone (over 18 only because of the violence and sexuality). The true story of Teena Brandon, ""Boys Don't Cry"" will make you sick, sad, and intrigued at the same time. Having grown up in a small rural town full of tunnel-visioned people, I can relate with the movie from the stand point of being different and sticking out like a sore thumb. Even tho it's an independent film, the story has been ""Hollywood-ized"", but the real story it is based upon has been told without apology or disclaimer. Because it is an independent film, it doesn't have the big-budget look, and it really doesn't need it. The heart of the story gets told honestly, and with a story like this, it wouldn't have been right any other way. Hillary Swank deserved her Oscar for this, and you will believe her portrayal of a woman trying her darnedest to be a guy. Many times, I forgot that she was a woman, but not in a campy, impersonator-type way. She looks like a young, baby-faced boy/man, and has the mannerisms, look, and lingo down. This is a tragic tale and Teena Brandon was definitely a messed-up individual, however, her gender-identity really takes a back seat to her up-bringing, her choice of friends, her habitual lying, and troubles with the law. Because of the combination, she is ignored by her family and the legal-system; the two entities anyone should be been able to count on. In the end, these are the things that kill her - the two morons who pull the trigger are just the vehicle. Still, you will end up hating the killers and see their backwards, red-necked male-macho baloney for what it is way before the movie heats up. This is more than just a trans-gender movie, it is a complex tale that includes a cast of characters you have probably known once or twice in your life.

I saw this film amidst the Oscar hype surrounding it, and after seeing clips on many talk shows, I figured I knew what to expect.  ""Pretty convincing as a boy"", I thought to myself after seeing Ms Swank butched up with short hair, bound breasts, and stuffed jeans.  That's only a small part of what makes this performance one of the best I've ever seen from any actor or actress.Throughout this tragic true story, Hilary Swank speaks with an accent so flawless, it rivals any performance by Meryl Streep.  The breadth of emotions that Ms Swank can convey using only her eyes without even speaking, that range from lust, to surprise, to terror, are so convincing, you don't need to understand what she's saying to understand what she's feeling.Boys Don't Cry introduces Hilary Swank as one of a small number of heavyweight actresses that can compete for the even smaller number of well written roles for young actresses these days.  Even though the story is sad & disturbing, you need to SEE THIS MOVIE.",Boys Don't Cry
176,JulyHizon 18 male,THE RAINMAKER'S EXIT,10,1 April 2001,"Hilary Swank's performance is awesome! She convinced me that Brandon Teena is really a man. I don't think any other human being could've done a better job. The same goes to director Kim Peirce. This is my favorite movie of all time! Before I saw this movie, I never thought that the art of film making could reach such perfection! This story is not only true but it is very delicate, a single second of bad acting would've ruinned the entire project! And we never saw that single second of bad acting from any of the cast members! The movie doesn't focus on hate crimes or being a gender case study, instead it portrays Brandon as a lone drifter on a doomed quest for happiness. He moves to a different town to start a new life and then moves to the next after his secret is discovered; and so the cycle continues. The setting is a trailor trash town where everybody is almost the same. No one seems to have a future or even any enthusiasm for life. Brandon stood out from everyone by being nice to girls and by being optimistic. His most obvious feature is that he's not very smart so he's always taking the wrong risks. He has thousands of dollars worth of speeding tickets, is wanted for 18 counts of grand theft auto and has a bunch of fake IDs; he tells his new found friends in Fall City that his mom's an actress and that his sister is a supermodel (we know he's lying). We notice that he never thinks far enough ahead so he's always getting into trouble. We also realize that when we as human beings are troubled, lonely, and in search of sanity; we are willing to take such risks. His whole life is one wreck after another. Despite his police record and web of lies, he's a really nice person who's always running away from his past. Which is full of suicidal memories and mistakes he needs to be forgiven for. I think  the point of the story is that happiness is just an illusion. Think about that scene when he gets physically intimate with his girlfriend. And then the next day she's thinking about him, and she kinda knows that he might be a girl. Instead of trying to find out the truth, she pushes the thoughts into the back of her mind and refuses to think about it. Why? Cuz if he is a girl then the romance is over and the nicest young man she's ever known will cease to exist. And as for Brandon, as long as he keeps up his charade of lies, he's okay; but at some point the past will catch up with him. And then we realize that there are those who have to pay a large price for only a brief moment of happiness.",Boys Don't Cry

Also those who wish to see a truly impressive performance of a woman pretending to be a man should view the film Just One of the Guys(1985). While Miss Swank's performance is very good, actress Joyce Hyser gives an equally wonderful performance as Terry in Just One of the Guys(1985). Hollywood (and the Oscars) often overlook comedic performances.  Just One of the Guys(1985) is not Oscar worthy, but it is a simple 80's comedy with an Oscar worthy performance that should be given another viewing.",Boys Don't Cry

Set in small town America her need to express herself as a man means she can never be known as once being a woman. Brandon falls in love, and makes friends with the local boys. However it isn't long before his true identity is uncovered.Hilary swank's performance in this film is exceptional, So believable is her portrayal of Brandon, that it is actually hard to initially imagine that she is in fact a woman. The conclusion to this film is harrowing and very moving. As hard as it may be to watch, it is intended to be that disturbing in order to make the audience think.The wonderful aspect of this film is that the moral lesson that is given to the audience isn't inflicted upon them in a preachy or patronising way.

Hilary Swank's admittedly fine performance was lost in the noise of depicting rituals like ""bumper surfing,"" as well as ""going to the bar, drinking, and picking a fight,"" ""driving around, drinking, and picking a fight with rich kids,"" and the perennial, ""just sitting around the house, drinking, and fighting with each other.""Who were these other people?

I figured, maybe it's just taking a little long to get started so I sat through another ten minutes.  By then I knew I hated this movie. Hilary Swank is in no way a convincing male (not just because of her obvious physical features but she's too feminine when trying to behave masculine). So I left the film on and went to the bathroom to shave.  After about another 10 minutes (I had no shaving cream), I went back to the movie.  It was still crap.  So I turned it off and popped in ""Bringing Out The Dead"" (by far a much superior movie).  I know this movie was based on actual events but I don't care.  Garbage is garbage no matter what it's based on. I know people will REALLY hate me for trashing this movie but I don't care. When I told my girlfriend how much I hated it she was in shock.  In all honesty, I sorta felt I was treating this film harshly since I had just viewed a movie that really spoke to me (again, ""Bringing Out The Dead"") just prior to viewing this one.  Then again, ""Bringing Out The Dead"" is a slow paced love it/hate it movie so perhaps the comparison isn't so bad.  After all, wouldn't ""Bringing Out The Dead"" be the obvious loser between the two? Yet it wasn't.  I may try to watch the whole movie someday (with ALOT of black coffee and LOTS of soda and candy) but I honestly don't see why I should bother.For those of you that may accuse me of being sexist or god knows what, I actually have liked so-called chick-flicks to the point that I believe there is no such thing.  I might also add that sexual choices and differences do not offend me in any way.Also, for those who think I don't know my ass from my elbow, if you truly want to see a female actor playing a convincing male watch Linda Hunt's performance of Billy Kwan in `The Year of Living Dangerously.'

Instead I was treated to a film with a plot that resembled watching grass grow and characters that I not only couldn't come close to relating to, never mid actually liking.Much like the horse Whisperer, they could have wrapped this one up in under one hour, but I assume the director was trying to be ""deliberate"" -- a catch phrase for those who want to be entertained by movies that has come to mean unbearably dull.",Boys Don't Cry
186,mitchel6,This film is a must for every single human being.,10,22 January 2000,"Thank God Boys Don't Cry is getting so much attention.  It recaptures the tragic true life story of Brandon Teena in a shockingly realistic way. And Hilary Swank's performance is simply amazing.The film could be looked at as just another addition to the growing field of queer cinema--but it really shouldn't be.  Yes, it does center around a young girl living her life as a boy, but the film has moral implications about society--about people in general.  Brandon is not portrayed as someone you really feel sorry for at the beginning of the film.  You might even disagree with his/her outlook on life and see the way he chooses to live it as a great deception.  But by the end of the film, you are totally drawn in and see Brandon as a real human being.  He's not perfect.  He has problems. But then again, don't we all?  That's the great thing about this film: it's so realistic that about halfway through it, you forget that you're suppose to be enjoying a movie.  You realize that this story really happened.  A young girl living as a boy was really  raped and ultimately killed. You're left wondering how in the hell such an atrocity could occur.  You're left feeling ashamed that people exist in the world that could inflict such horrors upon another human being.  If you're searching for hardcore entertainment, this film might not be exactly right for you.  But if you want to see something that will literally change the way you look at life in general, then you must see Boys Don't Cry.",Boys Don't Cry

The movie was thought provoking and the story needed to be seen in greater depth then how the networks reported the tragedy.  I hope you see the movie for what it is and not focus on the duplicitous nature of Teena Brandon, who could be seen as somewhat villainous.  The message of intolerance in today's culture and how it needs to be changed and re-examined.i do have one small problem with this movie and it is a small one....

188,how821017,Find your value of life,8,5 January 2005,"It's my first time to see such a fag movie. Before that I had known that Hilary Swank won Oscar best actress. I am shocked by her performance now, that's so brilliant and incredible, I even consider it's the best performance of Oscar best actress winners in ten years. The story of Teena Brandon, she is a lesbian and wanna be a true boy, do what boys could do. It's her dream and she was addicted to disguising herself as a boy. She failed again and again after she was debunked till she got away. She fell in love with a girl in a strange town. That moment, I thought she achieved first step of her dream, but she was debunked once more and consequently rape and murder occurred on her. Dream broke eventually. Despite it happened I still believe it's valuable and worthwhile for what she did. Society embodies various love relationship, today people contain queer relationship. Fags are never stared at as a sort of abnormality. When we look back, I found they lived very hard and unfair that time. Everyone has a dream. Teena tried her best to doing that, her ending never means her failure, she knew who she is and detected her value in her life from the romance. She's fortunate because not everybody knew that, even if they had lived for seventy or eighty years or more. Teena got it when she's only twenty-one. Sexual identity crisis or queer phenomenon is still a sensitive topic somewhere such as my hometown. Maybe our culture is truly conservative. But I learned everyone's every type of love should be respectable if only it's true. I esteem every choice that from heart and I love the character of Hilary Swank. Obviously it's a serious theme and not suitable for children. But we need this kind of story, that instructs us how to understand others lives, just be yourself whatever people comment on you. 8 out of 10",Boys Don't Cry
189,suro,...,9,16 June 2000,"I was at first puzzled that director Kim Peirce had placed Lana at the murder scene, but I realized later that it was her way of showing Lana's love for Brandon. Lana never felt deceived even as Brandon, standing in his jail cell, fully aware that there is nothing he can say or do to hide the fact that he is a woman, looks painfully into her eyes to hear her say, ""I don't care."" In their own way, it was a cheerful, loving moment of their relationship. Only the audience knew the doom; to Brandon and Lana, it was the beginning.The killings were unjustifiable, but I really felt compassion for the two killers. They weren't anonymous or cold, they were human beings like Brandon, struggling to find their own identities. Peirce painted a vivid picture of their dead-end lives, forgotten just for a moment through alcohol and drugs. The time-lapsed cinematography of the smoke billowing from the factories, the clouds flying through the sky, the characters seemed suspended helplessly in their personal hell.Even as Brandon is savagely raped, we're not asked to feel pity for Brandon, nor anger at the rapists who were once his friends. It was a venting of the frustration of their inability to be what they don't know how -- that only Brandon was able to do -- be loving. From their broken homes, respect for women, or even for themselves, was never on the list. Boys Don't Cry. I didn't cry, but I knew deep inside my heart, I was crying for Brandon, Lana, John, and Tom, and the two innocent victims. It will never be the same.",Boys Don't Cry

191,Kritic-3,"slow, depressing and utterly disturbing",6,20 June 2000,"Boys don't cry is perhaps one of the longest movies to watch.  Both the content of the movie and the plot leave you begging for the end.  The movie is extremely slow and this is mainly because the plot is so lacking. We get to know Brandon, but the first hour of the movie is merely a party. Party after party, leads the audience to get bored with the film, because it doesn't seem to be going anywhere.  In fact, it takes at least twenty five minutes of the film for Brandon to even meet Lana.  Aside from the grudging pace of the film, the content is utterly disturbing and depressing.  We watch some of the most low class people.  The only people that seem to shine are Brandon and Lana, and this is expressed well in the scenes where they dream about going to Memphis.  Towards the end of the film, the plot picks up and so does the speed.  We hope that Brandon and Lana can make it and that they dont hurt Brandon.  The ending adds a major shock to this hope.  I suppose that the director was aiming at creating a parrallel between Brandon as a guy in the beginning and as an uncovered woman in the end. At first we see that these people really like him as a good friend.   The acting in this film is really great, and Swank is brilliant.Nevertheless, the grudging pace and excessive depressing scenes boggled down the great performances.  (6 of 10)",Boys Don't Cry

The lead character is a convicted felon (grand theft auto) who is also a congenital liar.  She lies to her friends, steals and consistently lies to her girlfriend and not just about her gender -- she lies about pretty much everything.  Yet, people see this as a love story?!?Most of the other characters are pretty much scum of the earth too.  The two murderers, Lana's mom, is just an alcoholic loser who lets he daughter hang around convicted felons (the two muderers, not just Brandon).  Lana doesn't seem to give a crap when her mom is brutally murdered -- and what happened to the kid?

On the other hand, it seems that this role of Brandon Teena or Teena Brandon was meant to be for Hilary, since I saw an interview on E! made in 1994, and she said that her name on her upcoming movie would be Brandon and that they wanted to cut her hair... It's unbelievable... As regards the movie, it is very well made and very well performed... No only was Hilary amazing, but Chlöe Sevigni was spectacular too and the rest of the cast was also very good.

194,mtslord,"Disturbing, important, well done",9,30 May 2000,"""Boys Don't Cry"" is a disturbing, painful film, but appropriately so.  It explores issues of gender identity, relationships, and the limits of tolerance in small-town America.  It doesn't paint a pretty picture, which is even more painful considering that the story told is based on real events.  Brandon Teena is, as has been oft-repeated by now, an extremely compelling character.  He/she believes he/she is a man trapped in a woman's body.  He is attracted to women, but does not identify as a lesbian, and is determined to live as a man which is the only time that he feels right. During the course of the film, he pursues relationships with several women, and in these relationships, he is gentle and compassionate, and reveals his very big heart.  Of course, as Brandon is staying in a small town and not maintaining a particularly low profile, the secret is eventually discovered, and his ""friends"" turn out to be capable of a great deal of violence, and Brandon is raped (an act done to her as a woman to try to enforce her gender.)  The rape and her reaction to it are probably the most compelling, interesting, and important parts of the film.Also important is the fact that while Brandon is ultimately doomed, some of the friends that he had made were able to transcend their discomfort over his gender identity crisis, and show him love and compassion even after the secret was out.Finally, Hilary Swank fully deserved the Academy Award that she won for portraying Brandon.  She is fully believable in a role that must have been incredibly difficult and painful to play.",Boys Don't Cry
195,c0olc610942,A stunning film. Shows the Courage of an amazing woman who wanted to be different.,10,15 June 2000,"when i first rented this,i had no idea what it was about, but i wanted to guve it a shot cauz i like the actress hilary swank. at the end of the film, i was shocked. here, a young woman is brutally raped and killed for not only being sexually confused, but different. all the actors/actresses are great, especially hilary swank (who does a magnificent portrayal for Brandon Teena/Teena Brandon.The Story: (i kinda give it away, so if you don't want the whole story, just forget it) It starts in Lincoln, Nebraska. Brandon Teena goes to a few bars to pick up some girls, however, he is chased by a mob (probably angry fathers). Why? Brandon is a woman. Brandon then goes to another city in Nebraka and meets Lana(Chloe Sevigny) and a group of her friends including John Lotter(Lana's ex)and Tom ???. First John and Tom think Brandon is a good guy and a good friend, until they find out about Brandon's true identity. Lana, on the other hand, falls is love with Brandon and still loves him even after she finds out his secret.Brandon and Lana feel they are true soulmates and they want to stay together, however John and Tom disagree. They embarrass Brandon by taking off his pants and show it to everyone, including Lana. Then John and Tom brutally rape Brandon on Dec 30 (i think). Brandon pressed charges, so John and Tom decide to kill her. She is shot and stabbed in front of Lana (however, in real life i don't think lana really witnessed Brandon's death). They also kill 2 other people, but not Lana. John and Tom were arrested and you could tell Lana is trying to go on without her soulmate.It makes me sad that Brandon had to die at such a young age (20 or 21) and I feel bad for Lana. Brandon was basically sexually confused and different. She did not deserve to be killed because she was confused. Brandon should've been more careful, he probably would know what would've happened when Lana and her family and friends found out, but at least she or he had the strength and courage to do what she believed in.

A must see film.,10,6 November 2003,"First, I would like to say that I was stupid enough to see some spoilers prior to watching this move and I knew the ending. So I thought that the movie won't move me much. I was so wrong! That movie nearly brought me to tears and I am a person who just can't cry even if I want to. Watching the final scene I had a big lump in my throat and feeling so sad. That almost never happens when I watch movies. I won't explain the plot, a lot of people have already done that and it is not the most important thing in this film. It is a film about feeling, about being yourself, making mistakes and paying for them, against prejudice. Few movies actually feel so ""real"" as this one - the setting, the characters, the action. Hilary Swank was performed superbly in this movie, I just don't understand why does she gets so few good roles nowadays. You could see Brandon's desire to live the way he/she wants, the struggle he made in life. She was so believable pretending to be a boy. I really felt compassion for her.  And the love story with Lana(another powerful performance from Chloë Sevigny) was so beautiful, well done and moving... Another great feature is the portrayal of the characters - they all had some flaws,there aren't the perfectly innocent victims Hollywood loves to use,  even  Tom and John( the ""bad guys"") showed some good sides of their personalities( although at the end of the movie I really wanted them to suffer terribly).

It certainly reminds you of how horrible the world can be, and how cruel and narrow-minded people are. I couldn't stop thinking about it for days.Everybody should see this film. This is the kind of film where it doesn't really matter if the lighting is perfect or if the art direction is good or if the camera angles are correct, because this film has got such an important message. However, it just so happens that this film also has good lighting and camera work etc. Everything about this film shows the pain and the fear, the loneliness and it really shows how much we are willing to do just to be accepted, and to be loved. I am so happy Hilary Swank got an Oscar for this, because she is Excellent!We must never stop fighting for what is right, and we have to start accepting people. Making other people feel bad won't make you feel good. Hitting back is not going to stop the pain from the first punch. This films won't leave anyone feeling nothing, it really touches you.

But movies like ""Boys Don't Cry"" won't be the catalyst that brings this change in heart about. Here is a film that manages to be as repugnant as the tragedies it depicts. It is filled with exceptionally well-played characters, not one of which is at all likable. Brandon, (portrayed wonderfully by Hilary Swank) the proverbial ""man trapped inside a woman's body,"" is undoubtedly intended as the story's protagonist, but aside from the love he feels for Lana (another fine performance from Chloe Sevigny), he possesses no admirable characteristics; he is profoundly stupid in the choices he makes, and doesn't seem to realize just how precarious his position is. He's a sheep surrounded by a pack of wolves but is either too naive or too lovestruck to notice. His constant run-ins with the authorities certainly don't make things much easier. The rest of the characters are your stereotypical Midwest lowlifes: their activities consist of drinking, smoking, and working dead-end jobs.

My brain keeps saying it's a great movie but the heart doesn't responds ""well yeah ...guess it isn't bad"".

Where is the actor for Phillip Devine? Some people think that adding his character to the story is not vital but I think it is. It shows just how cowardly and evil John Lotter and Tom Nissen actually were.Another aspect that I noticed was how the Sheriff was pretty tame in the movie. If you go back and find the true story or hear the audio somehow...you will see that the Sheriff who actually interviewed her was very inappropriate and unprofessional.I cannot think of another movie so far where the actors fit so much with the real life people. Casting did such a great job finding the characters for John Lotter and Brandon Teena. Both Hilary Swank and John Peter Sarsgaard get 10/10 stars from me in their performance.This movie ends up being emotional because Lana (Chloe Sevigny) loses two people.

One wonders too whether some viewers were voting their personal discomfort with the protagonist's problems with sexual identity, rather than assessing a movie. Hilary Swank's is a truly exceptional performance: gut-wrenchingly real, winning you over with her stunning ability to create a living character that is so real one forgets that one is watching fiction. The fiction is merely apparent in this case. The writing and direction too is superlative. There are only 2 problems with Boys Don't Cry: 1) it is so convincing that it is truly upsetting to watch. 2) it's hard for Swank to go anywhere other than down in terms of performance. Having watched her last night in the also excellent Million Dollar Baby, attempting to assess her work for me is very difficult; one can't help comparing her performance to BDC and finding yourself thinking that she hasn't had to produce that much out of her locker.

214,zvelf-2,One of the best films of 1999,9,13 October 1999,"Following actual events pretty closely, director Kimberly Peirce and her co-writer Andy Bienen pick up Brandon Teena's story from his move to Falls City, Nebraska, where Brandon meets and falls in love with local girl, Lana. This incurs the wraths of Brandon's heretofore friends, John Lotter and Tom Nissen, both ex-cons.  What is impressive about Boys Don't Cry is that Peirce doesn't sensationalize the material, which is easily done in lesser hands with such subjects as gender-bending, rape, and murder. Nor does Peirce, a lesbian, exude an agenda.  Brandon is shown warts and all as a thief and habitual liar (about far more than his gender), while John and Tom are welcoming and amicable before they uncover Brandon's secret. Peirce even allows that John's loathing for Brandon may derive more from his jealousy of Lana than homophobia, though homophobia abets his actions.  Brandon does not come off as a martyr, but very much an individual. Brandon refuses the label of lesbian. The subtext is gender fluidity and the questioning of why we have to categorize sexual orientation at all.  Labels emphasize difference, and difference is a code word for misanthropy.Peirce intersperses wonderful time-lapse sequences of the horizon, the clouds, the stars, even a refinery throughout the film.  While these could just be throwaway flourishes, their beauty and timing point to a transcendent hope in the characters' dreams, no matter how stupid they may be, like Brandon's preoccupation with Memphis or Lana's wanting to become a karaoke singer.  Only at the end, does Pierce's romanticization get the better of her, in a fictional love scene between Lana and Brandon.The entire cast is superb.  Actress Hilary Swank holds nothing back in giving the character of Brandon brashness, longing, hope, naivete, and denial.  Matching her every step of the way is Chloë Sevigny as Lana, and their chemistry together is wholly convincing.  Sevigny (along with Sarah Polley) is among the great actors of her generation.  Peter Sarsgaard imbues John with both humanity and barbarous malevolence.  In two smaller roles of great merit are Alicia Goranson, who plays Candace, Brandon's first friend in Falls City, and Jeanetta Arnette as Lana's outlandish mom.",Boys Don't Cry
215,Warp-5,"Great movie, but not without problems",9,2 April 2000,"I have to say that I went to this movie with an attitude of,""Ok Miss Beverly Hills 90210 Oscar winner, impress me!"" And she did...Hilary Swank was great and really did deserve that award. She really came across as a young man, in fact I found her quite attractive. The entire cast were excellent in there roles and obviously well chosen. I went to this film with no knowledge of the true story that lay behind it and perhaps this affected my grasp of the film. What I mean by that is, it seemed that the director expected the audience to have some knowledge of Brandon Teena's story. This may be the reason why there was not enough understanding of character motivation on the audiences behalf. And the director also tended to fall into the trap of the retelling of events rather than character development. An excellent director can tell us everything about a character with one shot. This lack of development lead me to find the beginning of this movie very disjointed. All this aside the amazingly convincing performances from the entire cast held this film up to be a fascinating watch. The direction of the rape and love making scenes were brillantly executed and did make up for other direction flaws in the movie. I think the Academy finally got something right, Hilary Swank deserved her award, but the film as whole certainly didn't deserve an award. That said I really enjoyed this film. Go see it, just be prepared to be disturbed...",Boys Don't Cry

Hilary Swank's performance reminded me of Linda Hunt's Oscar winning performance in The Year Of Living Dangerously (1983), both women were so outstanding you actually forget that they are not men, I recommend this disturbing but memorable film.",Boys Don't Cry

218,billm75,"Absolutely Brilliant Performances, But It's Not For Everyone",10,4 August 2000,"I won't rehash the plot of this movie nor wax philosophical about man's inhumanity to man.  There is one overriding reason to rent this movie:  The sheer joy of watching a great artist give the performance of their life.Watching Hilary Swank(and to an only slightly lesser extent, Chloe Sevigny) here, is like watching Hendrix at Woodstock and Monterey, Michealangelo at the Sistine Chapel, Montana in the Super Bowl and Jordan in the NCAA/NBA Finals.  It is simply, IMHO, one of the two best acting jobs of the last thirty years, the other being Robert De Niro in ""Taxi Driver"".  Swank is charismatic and mesmerizing in a way the real Brandon/Teena could've only dreamed about.  Her facial expressions and body movements are enthralling and letter perfect.  You can't look away from the screen for a second.Writer/director Kimberly Peirce accomplishes the near impossible by making these losers all seem much more dignified and sympathetic then they actually are/were(watch the documentary ""The Brandon Teena Story"" and read the book ""All She Wanted"" to see what I mean).WARNING:  This movie is very depressing, profane and violent, and is only loosely based on what actually happened.  However, I think that Swank's glorious light brightens the gloom more than enough.  Peirce very wisely adds a nice coda(Swank voiceover) at the end.For a real trip, watch ""The Next Karate Kid"" right afterwards! :)Story/filmmaking: 8 outa 10, Acting: 10+ outa 10.",Boys Don't Cry
219,pre_rook22,Only God knows Why......,10,4 August 2000,"""Boys Don`t Cry"" is an amazing and dazzling film experience that will live with me forever. This movie is so emotionally enthralling and brutally realistic it hurts my heart to know that it is a true life story. A lot of people believe this is a ""gay"" movie but I need..no I HAVE to correct that misguided belief. In Brandon`s mind he was a boy and he had fallen in love with a girl the way boys do. There was nothing wrong with that considering Lana felt the same way about him. Lana knew the truth but chose to ignore it and see Brandon and not Teena, she did not care that he was really physically a ""she"". This even makes it more painful to believe John and Tom are real life trash who could be so cruel. Only God knows why they did what they did. While watching this movie everyone somehow relates to Brandon: Everyone has their own pain which masks into a secret which masks into a lie... and Brandon was tired of trying to live a lie that was not him. If only Brandon would of left that night......why didn`t he leave?I truly believe Hilary Swank and Chloe Sevigny have played the best and most important roles to be portrayed in this time. Hilary might have become more Brandon than Brandon was. She took on the character perfectly. She some became this handsome young man in his own personal war. Chloe made you feel the same intensity and want that Lana Tisdel felt. She deserved the Oscar, she earned it. Kimberley Pierce is beyond brilliant and should be noted above John Woo and Steven Spielberg. She has taken a life and turned it into a legacy.I`ve watched this movie more times than I can remember and every time tears stream down my face and I end up re-evaluating my life. ""Boys Don`t Cry"" makes you think. It makes you wonder was Brandon more powerful for having the heart to be who felt he really was or for going back to Falls City to be with Lana?!All you need is sympathy, compassion and a little bit understanding to love this movie and if you don`t its because you`re an example of why Brandon could not live the way he wanted to.Only God knows why this tragedy has become pure brilliance!",Boys Don't Cry

While Hillary Swank certainly deserves all the acclaim she received for her depiction of Brandon/Teena, what lifts the movie above the Issue-of-the-Week/After School Special premise is how the director captured small town life, and especially how masculinity is defined in such settings. Undergirding this is the contrast between the casual evil of the killers and the incredibly touching performance of Chloe Sevigny.",Boys Don't Cry

222,MovieFanBenLinus8,Boys Don't Cry- Movie Review,9,27 February 2013,"Boys Don't Cry is an extremely affecting film, one that well worth the inevitable emotional difficulties throughout the viewing. This is not a film for everyone, however; it is frequently brutal and depressing in the emotional honesty of its story. That said, anyone interested should absolutely give this film a look. The film is based upon true events and the tragic circumstances of Brandon Teena (Hilary Swank), a trans man dealing with a sexual identity crisis. She wants to be seen as a man desperately, and because she unwisely acts upon her instincts, she ends up raped and dead by the end of the film. She realizes too late that she can't run from her past completely. Brandon remains a fully sympathetic character, and much of this is due to Swank's masterful performance. She has a sense of innocence about her, as she desires to find her place in the world and become the person who she wants to be, but she forgets to think about the consequences. She flies too close to the sun and ultimately pays the price for it. Ironically, she is one of the few characters in the movie fully willing to seek what she wants. The family she stays with for much of the film lives a morally and emotionally empty life. Only the daughter, Lana (Chloe Sevigny) seems to recognize this; she hates her working-class job and the dangers she frequently has to face around ex-convict John Lotter (Peter Saarsgard). Regardless of her gender, it is no wonder she ends up falling for Brandon. Both hate societal norms and wish to escape to Memphis to live better lives together. They both ultimately find themselves unable to, as Lotter has his own perspective on those societal norms, and he simply can't take any variations. He's a monster, yes, but his motivation for raping and murdering Brandon is one of confusion. He can't comprehend that the concept of gender isn't as simplistic as he thought, and more importantly, that the world isn't as simplistic as it seems. This is a difficult movie to watch, as it has the level of impact akin to that of a classical Greek tragedy. Brandon is unable to overcome her fatal flaw, and it ends up costing her her life. However, it is also extremely insightful and touching with regards to her courage to go and pursue her desires. We could all learn something from Brandon, but we must go about it in a wiser manner.Overall Rating: 9/10- ""Seriously Guys, See This Movie.""",Boys Don't Cry

I walked out of the cinema completely moved by this utterly exceptional piece of film making. Hilary Swank was so brilliant in her role, but so too were the remainder of the cast, especially Chloe Sevigny.After seeing this film, I felt like how I did when I saw ""Once Were Warriors"" for the first time. Sure, both films are sad, but they provide a literal punch in the face after viewing them. Both felt so real, and having dealt with lower class people and Maoris through work, such felt the case as they were the real deal.A really worthwhile film that I can't recommend enough.

The violence and specifically the rape scene (this is not a spoiler, since it's already mentioned in the IMDB movie description), while intense, have been done in other movies before. The movie is competently directed, and the director has already mastered Hollywood's oft-used technique of emotionally manipulating the audience.

The director, Kimberly Pierce deserves much credit for telling the story subtlety, no black and white, he's wrong, she's right.

228,sps112,Depressing but Good Movie About Northern White Trash,8,3 April 2000,"I saw ""Boys Don't Cry"" a few days ago.  I would give it * * * (out of four). The acting is excellent.  I never heard of most of the cast before I saw it.  Hillary Swank got most of the publicity, and rightly so I guess, since she was the lead character and was nominated for the lead actress Oscar. (I saw it the night before the awards.)  However, I was real impressed with Chloe Sevigny and I didn't even know until I got home that she also was nominated as best supporting actress.Since I wasn't familiar with with the cast for the most part, and they were all great actors/actresses, that made their portrayals as the Northern (Nebraska) white trash characters extremely realistic.  However, to me that was both a plus and a minus.  They were so real and relentless in their white trash behavior that they all got on my nerves, like I was there with them instead of watching them in a movie.  It's sorta nauseating to realize that there are people just like that all around us.  That brings up another problem I had with the movie - about half of the characters had southern accents though it is set in Nebraska.  I noticed that it was filmed in Texas, so maybe they recruited some locals for roles in the movie, but it seems like it would perpetuate northerners' continuing perception that we're all white trash down here in the south, or that white trash people only exist in the south.The movie is very depressing at times, and I had a hard time forming an objective opinion without considering the depressing theme and the redneck factor.",Boys Don't Cry

Just as Brandon finally found love and began feeling as if she was fitting in, those close to her discovered her secret.After watching the movie I felt emotionally exhausted.

What is so awful about leaving the tragic destination of the Brandon Teena story as it is known to have ended by any American with a television set or newspaper subscription. I did love every other moment of this movie though. And Hilary Swank deserved every bit of her Oscar.

Ms Swank was rewarded for her stirring performance with an Academy Award. However, after several viewings of this film, I feel that her performance has been overrated. Although her appearance was appropriately boyish, her delivery of the lines was usually a dead giveaway as to her gender. She wouldn't have fooled me for a minute.

Also, for the record, I cannot think of a single artwork which has produced significant political or moral change. While a good few have become symbols for a cause (Miller's 'The Crucible' against the Red-scare, Dylan's 'Blowin in the Wind' against segregation, Picasso's 'Guernica' against Franco's war) I don't think we should give Boys Don't Cry extra credit for presenting a harsh depiction of the horrors of prejudice, nor should we take credit away if we don't think it will have any effect on the moral fibre of our generation. It is, after all, just a film, albeit one of a real and tragic life.I'll agree with the comments that the cinematography was nothing special - but must a film have amazing cinematography? i think it had some understatedly beautiful shots when and only when appropriate (along with the sped up landscape shots - check out the Brandon-eye-view of Lana through the factory window - a beautiful shot depicting Brandon admiration for her).

I would also like to know who exactly wrote this movie, because it failed miserably in its attempt to elicit sympathy for the main character.  If the situations in the movie are extremely accurate in their portrayal of real events, then I find I have no sympathy for Swank's character.  Based solely on her decisions, not on her sexual orientation, she apparently got what was coming to her. If one wants to me to sympathize with a person, she had better be worth it. Swank's character was an imbecile who garnered no emotion from me.  The story was dull and I could not relate with any of the characters.

Knowing this was a true story, like Monster, is the worst part. Knowing somebody really had to experience all of the pain she did. I was drawn in right from the start of the movie. I wouldn't watch this with anybody if I were you. Its better to watch things like this alone, because it may make you uncomfortable if your eyes begin to water and they see you.

The movie is based on true events of the brutal rape and murder of Teena Bradon (Bradon Teena) in 1993.The hardships that Brandon (or Teena) had to deal with were captured more than perfectly by Hilary Swank, and the heartbreak and confusion of his girlfriend Lana Tisdel (Chloë Sevigny) are played with raw passion that have you gripping onto something to keep yourself from being bowled over by awe.Kimberly Peirce directed this movie with passion, emotion and such fire that it captivates you within the first few moments. She brought the characters out so well and each acted their own part in amazing ways.On a whole the film may make some viewers turn away or turn off with the graphic sex scene between Lana and Bradon, and the brutal rape scene towards the end of the film, violence and murder is also within this powerful movie but if you want to be stunned speechless this is the movie for you. brilliantly acted and well screen played. 10/10.

Instead, the makers of this film have gone for something much deeper, more complicated, and more resonant. Characters in this film relate to each other clumsily and inconsistently, just as in real life. And the script treats Brandon neither hagiographically nor exploitively: there is no clumsy scene in which someone ""explains"" why Brandon does what he does -- it's just taken for granted, as a mystery, and that makes it easier in a way to understand why it might have constituted such a threat to the fragile masculinities of the men who ultimately turned into murderers. (The stunning essay on Matthew Shepard's killers that ran in an issue of Harper's Magazine is a thought-provoking companion piece to this film). ""Boys Don't Cry"" also boasts a star-making performance by Hilary Swank, and an excellent supporting cast.Chloe Sevigny's quality has never been put to better effect -- especially when, in a brief sex scene with Brandon, director Kimberly Pierce lets her break out of her ordinariness, and shoots her like a Botticelli -- she suddenly looks ravishing, and it's a fitting visual entry point into the transforming power of that moment in the character's life.

""Boys Don't Cry"" is one of the most powerful films that I have ever seen. Ms. Hilary Swank embraced her character with open arms, and turned him into a hero. A incredibly hard task, considering a ""few minor 'glitches'"". The fact that this movie is based upon a true story only emphasizes the themes it is trying to portray. As a human race, it only makes sense that we should strive to accept our originality and differences, and celebrate them, rather than diminish them, and look upon them as being ""bad"". This movie is one that gives the audience the ""complete package"", and not just a pretty actress or soundtrack. As an all encompassing film, ""Boys Don't Cry"" is brilliant.",Boys Don't Cry
251,jilly-14,Disturbing but incredibly compelling!,9,20 October 1999,"I didn't see the documentary about Brandon Teena but this film was well worth seeing despite it being a fictionalized account.  Without spoiling the ending, it is superbly cast and directed.  There's no doubt that the violence (of which there is quite a bit) is very disturbing but the performances by Hillary Swank and Chloe Sevigny make this a painful but rewarding movie experience!",Boys Don't Cry
252,magda-13,Everybody should watch that movie,10,11 February 2000,"I just watched Boys don´t cry, and I am really sad about what I saw here. It is so hard to understand that there are still people out there (in America) who feel threatened if there is a queer, transsexual or just DIFFERENT person.... Hillary Swank´s outstanding,natural performance among the other great ones... the beautiful scenery and great music... the realistic setting of a hick, disillusioned village ... it all comes together to have created a wonderful, touching film that should everybody make thoughtful about why they don´t like some other people or what kind of prejudices they have.... watch that film!!",Boys Don't Cry
253,factorial5,A very powerful moving movie,10,12 March 2000,"You read all the glowing clippings about the performance by Hilary Swank, but I was still pretty much blown away by her portrayal of Teena Brandon. The scary thing is how she reminded you of a popular charming person you might have been friends with in high School...I was really surprised by the film it's self. I look forward to seeing Kimberly Pierce does next. I liked her style of film making, she did something that really brought home the feel of a small town and the stillness of the night.",Boys Don't Cry
254,ht225,The real American Beauty,10,1 April 2000,"Normally, I'm very careful with superlatives, but this one is by far one of the best movies I've seen in a very long time! Hilary Swank is a must-see in her role as Brendan Teena. She's so stunningly convincing in portraying a girl who finds happiness and finally a tragic end in living as a boy that s/he will live on in your mind long after the end of the film. Hilary really deserved to win the Oscar for her brilliant performance.Whereas American Beauty is in my opinion too pretentious and overdone, BDC is much truer to the point in portraying and criticising the dark(er) side of American society. The depiction of Trailer Park life, working class and youth in this environment is remarkably realistic: it helps a lot to understand Lana's 'belief' in Brendan being a guy and, on the other hand, in Tom and John's tragic reaction when they finally find out that he is actually a she. Under Kimberly Pierce's excellent (why wasn't she nominated for an Oscar??) direction the whole very talented cast gives its best to make this tragic but true story the real American Beauty. If you haven't seen this movie yet, do so now and you will encounter a memorable and mesmerising experience!",Boys Don't Cry
255,eldorko23,The Best film of 1999,10,25 May 2000,"I was utterly disappointed to see AMERICAN BEAUTY steal the Oscar from BOYS DON'T CRY during this year's academy awards.  Not only is BOYS DON'T CRY a better study in human emotion, it far exceeds AMERICAN BEAUTY in terms of form and style.  The commercial appeal of AMERICAN BEAUTY made it an easily digestible pseudo-art film that really didn't bring anything new to the table.  BOYS DON'T CRY, however, examines the the good in those we want to believe are evil, and the evil in those we want to believe are good. Perhaps the film was just a bit too rough for the academy voters, but hey, at least Swank won best actress.",Boys Don't Cry

And that was lucky, because tears just kept streaming down my face. It was so sad! Probably the saddest movie I have ever seen. I usually don't cry when watching TV or movies, but this one really got to me. It may be the fact that it's based on a true story. How could they be so cruel to him/her, just because he/she was different?! And Hilary Swank was so great as Brandon, sometimes I forgot that she was a *she*. You have to see it!Lacci",Boys Don't Cry

With absolutely brilliant performances from all involved, this movie made me cry (now THATS something special) and laugh and, most important, feel something. Deserving all its critical acclaim and much much more, Boys Don't Cry is a landmark film of the 20th Century, an instant classic to be enjoyed by all strong enough to take a real movie.",Boys Don't Cry

But is NOT the real story of what happened to Brandon Teena.Director Kimberly Pierce did not care about Brandon's story. All she cared about was making money. So she turned Brandon's story into a Romeo & Juliet story when that was not true. Lana was right. It is a second murder of Brandon.People need to understand Brandon's life was not a tragic love story. It was a tragic life period. Lana was not his soulmate. She was not his true love. She only knew him for two weeks. And she betrayed him. She set him up to be raped. And she was not there the night he was murdered. Lana is Just as guilty as the murderers.Again, all Pierce cared about was making the bucks. She should've told the REAL story. The real truth.",Boys Don't Cry
260,TNMovieFan,Why Do They Make Movies Like This?,1,24 November 2001,"I realize this movie is based on actual events, but either the screenwriter took a lot of liberties with this story, or the characters in it are some of the biggest fools I've ever seen.  The only thing I found slightly amusing about this film is how much Hillary Swank looked like a boy as Brandon. Anyway, back to my original point. I found the actions of the characters so unbelievable I counldn't believe this was anything close to a true story. Warning Spoilers Ahead! :I cannot believe that everybody in this film didn't end up hating Brandon after discovering how bad he/she had lied to them about virtually everything. Particularly Lana. And I cannot believe after discovering a person she had been intimate with had lied to her about their sex that she wouldn't be angry. And lastly, why the hell didn't they head out of town when John showed up wielding a gun? Instead Brandon heads back to Candice's and Lana wants to hang out with John? Why? I thought the characters behaved with all the intelligience of Friday the 13th characters. You know, standing there screaming rather than running for the door, when someone is threatening to kill them. I am willing to suspend belief when I watch a movie if it is fantasy or comedy, but when it's suppose to be a true story it is very frustrating to see characters behave so foolishly. In summary, if you watch this movie, I would wager when its over you will find yourself no better off for viewing it. This film is not uplifting or satisfying and ends with little sense of resolution.",Boys Don't Cry
261,darkane666,shocking but amazingly appreciated,10,6 June 2007,"I was going to give it 8/10 for it's being a watch-once movie to me but that doesn't decrease its value at all it just means that it is not the usual kind of entertainment that we can call ""a cup of tea"" so let's admit that some movies can be classified as critic-wise successful , it will get more awards than people fascinated about it while some people of course will appreciate it and understand its beauty with that said to warn the takeaway surfer I must say that all of the artistic elements are of a very high standard , high enough to deserve all the nominations and awards , after an intentionally ordinary beginning the drama gets very intense that it touched even a careless anti social person like me I got totally compassionated to this boy-girl (Hilary swank)who will do just about everything to prove she is a big man he is allegedly named Brandon which is actually (Teena Brandon), her special personality and very special alleged sexuality makes her the favorite boy friend to girls , passion scenes are extraordinary as opposite to the movie beginning the boy-girl will get too far for his love Lana (chloe) and he is no super hero like in action movies he can't do miracles that's why I can't watch it again , but I will never forget the love story of Brandon and Lana",Boys Don't Cry
262,shenyll,Heartfelt Movie,10,1 June 2009,"When I first watched Boys Don't Cry, I was a sheltered kid who didn't even know that homosexuality existed in society. The movie made me cry at the end. It made me even sadder when I found out later that it was based on a true story. I just hope that the ending was not true in real life as it made me so sad. The movie opened my eyes to new horizons, and made me more accepting of differences in people. It is a movie everyone should watch to understand what people who might be different from us can go through because of our intolerance. The movie is one of my old time favorites.Hilary Swank's acting was also amazing and portrayed the character really well. The movie made me a fan of hers.",Boys Don't Cry

264,KBiker,All about Hillary,8,22 February 2017,"Hillary Swank, after playing the forgettable character of the Next Karate Kid, giving a girly twist to the original Mr. Miyagi/Daniel relationship, turned her career around and established herself as one of Hollywood's best actresses with one of the great acting roles in memory, mine at least. She was Brandon Teena/Teena Brandon, she inhabited the role the way Brando did in his best (think Waterfront, Streetcar), George C. Scott did in Patton, Ben Kingsley did in Gandhi. She was a slam dunk for an Oscar, and everyone knew it. There was no suspense.As for the quality of the movie, it was quite good, IMO. I saw a documentary of the Brandon's story, and the movie, to me, adhered pretty closely to it. The acting of the other characters, Peter Sarsgaard, Chloe Sevigny, Brendan Sexton III, Jeannetta Arnette, was solid, and the air of impending tragedy was palpable throughout.All in all, a solid 8 for me.",Boys Don't Cry
265,cecai,A Destined Tragedy: A Review of Boys Don't Cry,5,24 November 2012,"Some people say that Boys Don't Cry can't be simply defined as a lesbian movie because the female lead in this film actually believes she herself is a male and she thinks she is not a lesbian at all but a transgendered individual. But I still considered Boys Don't Cry as a movie about a lesbian, a lesbian who doesn't have the courage to face the reality and admit she is a female lesbian, not a man. And I think the belief of she herself is a man but not a woman is the key reason of her tragedy and makes a big contribution to her death in the end.Brandon Teena is the popular new guy in a tiny Nebraska town. He hangs out with the guys, drinking, cussing, and bumper surfing, and he charms the young women, who've never met a more sensitive and considerate young man. But the fact all his friends don't know about is, Brandon actually is a woman who wraps her chest tightly with a piece of cloth to make it look flat and puts another piece of cloth into her pants to make it look like a man's penis.When she is making love to her girlfriend Lana, who does not know she is actually a woman at that time, Lana sees her cleavage and the cloth wrapped around her breast. Though Lana is shocked by the truth she sees, she doesn't expose Brandon's lie. She keeps being Brandon's girlfriend and loving her. She is so nice that she pretends Brandon was a true man and Brandon doesn't know that her girlfriend already finds out her secret.Brandon lies about her sex, but Lana forgives her and ignores it. I can't tell Lana is helping or harming Brandon. Even when Brandon's lie is debunked by other two young men in town, Lana still covers Brandon by saying "" I've seen him in the full flesh. I've seen it. I know he is a man. Problem's done?"" But her saying just makes the two young men even angrier. To prove what the fact is, the two .young men brutally take Brandon's pants off in front of Lana and force her to look at Brandon's private part which is just as normal as an ordinary woman. I think the saddest thing about Brandon is that she considers her woman's body as a defect. Brandon keeps telling everyone that she is ""born with this weirdness, like a birth defect"" and she still believes that she is a man when the two angry young men rape and kill her at the end of this movie. At the police station, she doesn't want to admit that she is raped at first. She just says ""I don't know what he did."" When the police officer asks ""where did they try to pop it in first"", it takes so much effort for Brandon to say out the word ""vagina"". And when the police asks her ""why do you go around kissing girls being you're a girl yourself"", she finally admit she ""has sexual identity crisis"" instead of emphasizing she is a man.From the beginning to the end, she couldn't accept her sexual identity and lies about it. She doesn't admit that she is a lesbian by reiterating to herself and others time and time again that she is just a transgendered individual. If anyone of Brandon and Lana could stop lying about the fact, maybe Brandon could escape the death. Brandon's tragedy has been destined from the very beginning because of herself.As to me, I have to say I don't like this film at all. The characters in this story are all so abhorrent, including the female lead Brandon. It's based on a true story and the film goes just like how Brandon's life goes on in the real world. It's a destined tragedy and I can feel nothing else but only hopeless after I finished seeing this movie.",Boys Don't Cry
266,andycosh34,Why don't boys cry?,9,1 June 2014,"I often wonder this. This film is the story of Brandon a girl who only feels right when passing off as a boy. What many people don't know is that he has no control over this it's just god gave him the wrong parts. Because of trying to be true to himself and following the girl he loves what follows is him being beat, raped, and tortured. This film shows how Lana fell in love with Brandon not because of his looks or that he is really a she but plane and simple he treated her better then she had ever been treated. This love story takes off but comes to a screeching halt. What John did to Brandon will stick in my head forever it's so hard to believe there is so much evil in this world. I would also like to say this is one of the most important films of all time. This is a film I will show to my kids, there kids and so on because I will make sure that they respect and love people for who they are. I pray for the day when we not only accept our diffeences but we actually celebrate our divercity.",Boys Don't Cry
267,carrot-3,did i see the same movie everyone else is praising?,1,30 April 2000,"Well, I must admit, I wasn't really looking forward to watching this film. Everyone thats seen the film has said that it's a real tear jerker, quite depressing, and by the way, it's a true story you know.  It's also supposed to be a great film.  I mean, it did win an academy award, right?  After seeing this, I think that says a lot more about the academy than it does about this film.  I have a feeling even Chris Rock could have taken an oscar for playing the role of Teena.  I'm not trying to say that Hilary Swank did a poor job, but it certainly wasn't the best of the year.  The movie itself held the aura of an after school special.  The script was shody, and the directing was lack-luster at best.  Every character except Chloe Sevigny's was a simple stereotype straight from the Jerry Springer show.  And hers was either lacking believability or proper motivation.  I couldn't figure out which.  The movie itself failed to reach me in the least.  Sure, it's a sad story, but this isn't a historically correct documentary, it's a hollywood movie.  And in a movie, you have to be able to identify with the characters before you can care about what happens to them.  Which I did not and makes me wonder who's giving this film such rave reviews.  So, if you spend your days watching Jerry Springer and COPS and consider it productive, then I'm sure you'll enjoy this film.  Otherwise, skip it and read the book if you want to know all about Teena Brandon.",Boys Don't Cry
268,danaf,"Awesome, frightening, sad, eye-opening flick about transgendered people in closed-minded, small town America",10,27 October 1999,"I was touched and stunned by this awesome work of art. ""Boys Don't Cry"" is the story of Brandon Teena's fight to be who he was, and his search for exactly how to get there. In Lincoln, NE..or Falls City, NE where he was murdered, no one around him, except his girlfriend offered support for who he was (-a young transgendered man who was born with the genitals of a female). He was scorned, ridiculed, raped, and ultimately murdered at age 21..just because he was a little different, and because tolerance for those who were different just isn't always part of small town life in Nebraska, USA.>I haven't cried at a movie in several years, at least. I cried several times during the course of this powerful movie. See it. And when it comes to cable watch it. And when it comes to video rent it. And when it comes to DVD/video for sale, buy it.

276,cthaler,a queer response to Boys Don't Cry and transgenderism,10,26 October 1999,"As a movie viewer, I thought this movie was incredibly made and amazingly acted; as a member of the queer community, I found it to be personally devastating.  I had seen The Brandon Teena Story before, and found that work to be profoundly moving and even life-changing.  But seeing the details brought so vividly and unflinchingly to life was deeply traumatic--and I am not usually disturbed by graphic movies.  I'm interested to hear what other progressive queers thought of the film; I myself identified strongly both with Brandon and with Lana, the woman who loved him in spite of the social consequences.  I walked out of the theater feeling utterly disgusted with the human race that is capable of such profound evil, and also feeling convinced of my own vulnerability, convinced that there is no reason why Brandon Teena's life was not my own, other than the sheer dumb luck of being from an urban, somewhat more accepting part of the world. I was a little disappointed that the movie strayed from the facts of Brandon's murder; I was unsure why the script decided to have Lana present for the shootings, other than to have her screaming dramatically in the background.  I think, also, that the director might have chosen to put a blurb at the end of the movie about the growing transgender movement. Brandon was transgendered, and every day the movement led by people like Leslie Feinberg and Kate Bornstein grows stronger.  Brandon described himself as having a ""sexual identity disorder""; this hints at pathology, and it seems reviewers are picking up on the term as  if it were the correct classification.  The director might have used her last minute with the audience to educate about transgenderism, instead of merely thanking Kate Bornstein and ""transmen"" in the credits.  At the very least, a nod to Matthew Shepard or James Byrd would have been nice, to prod the audience into the conscious realization that hate crimes are alive and well, and are interconnected.",Boys Don't Cry
277,madhag,Indudibly awesome from another queer POV,10,4 November 1999,"Warning: some spoilers This is the best new film I've seen this year. I walked in skeptical of Hilary Swank and the film but walked out totally blown away by the humanity of the story and acting by the entire cast. I saw the film about a week ago and I'm still greatly affected by it, and will see it again this weekend. I love it that Brandon isn't a clearcut character but full of contradictions. He wasn't a crusader and martyr (though we can make him), just someone who wanted to live truthfully to his nature. Even in the gay community, transgenders get a lot of c**p.What struck me was when Brandon was in jail, convincing Lana desperately that he had a sexual disorder. He didn't want to go back living the way he was as a woman, but rather be ""abnormal"" and ""crazy"" in the eyes of others so long as he can be accepted as a man- living as he wanted to be. Being young and naive, that logic didn't work, but it shows Brandon's raw, joyous impulse to live honestly to his nature, and could never go back to the closet and be dishonest to himself. Therefore I don't see that scene as suggestion that transgenderism is pathological. And the scenes with the nurse who examined him, and the mother's disgust with John and Tom's assault struck me too, that not all people are a******s, when they are willing to connect on a human level they can begin to change. The scenes added to character development which made them more real and powerful. This film inspired me greatly more than frightened me.Hilary Swank is spectacular and made me a believer. Before this film I perceived her as another actress but glad that I'm wrong. She's not just an actress but an artist, and her ability to carry out all the ranges of emotional nuances and physical expressions made her character realer than real. At times during the film I certainly forgot that she's a woman.",Boys Don't Cry

However, it features extremely impressive performances by the entire cast, but especially by Chloe Sevigny and Hilary Swank. Furthermore, it brings to the public an important narrative about the plurality of the self, in opposition to hardened ideas of a man is a man and a woman is a woman. It is also very timely, as violence against those who choose to live and love differently continues to occur, so much so that we might be getting inured to it.

A death delayed as friendships are formed and love, achingly, sweet love between Brandon and Lana is realized. Hilary Swank and Chloe Sevigny give performances not experienced on film for quite some time.  They are more than believable as fated lovers; they make us cry, we hold them in our hearts and remember them long after the film has ended. Kimberly Peirce has given us much more than a film.

Hilary Swank was superb and, indeed, made the entire film. Also, it was dead-on about a certain social milieu that doesnt appear in film all that much. My only quibble is: Hmmmmmmmmmmmm, i can see why brandon was attractive to women (he/she was a dark-haired leonardo dicaprio) BUT i cannot for the life of me see why those bottom-feeding macho boys liked him (that is, before they found out he was a she) . .",Boys Don't Cry

Boys Don't Cry is a very powerful movie that wisely chooses to record the events leading up to the inevitable conclusion, rather than preach to the viewer. A relatively simple story which could have been done very badly in the wrong hands, the film succeeds due to its strong characterisations, particularly those of Brandon, Lana and John.I have little to add to the other comments of praise, except to say I'm surprised by those who refer to Brandon as 'she'. At no time did Brandon seem anything other than male, even when it was clear that in one sense this was not completely true. That a mere movie is able to successfully evoke such a basic perception is a testament to its genuine power and the brilliant performances of Chloe Sevigny and Hilary Swank.",Boys Don't Cry

A powerful performance of despair in an unforgettable film.  But then I heard about ""Boys Don't Cry"" and had to check out Hillary Swank.In my 40 years of film fanaticism, I thought Meryl Streep's performance in ""Sophie's Choice"" was the best I'd seen.  Now I might have seen the topper.  I'm convinced that not only will Swank win the Oscar, but her performance will be remembered as one of the finest ever.The ultimate in the study of acting is to reveal that nugget of ""truth"" that convinces viewers they are witnessing reality. Swank has achieved this pinnacle.  It's one of those rare performances that made me believe I was watching a real person... made me want to love and protect her... made me ache and sob right along with Lana.For someone like me, a long-time movie fan and a lover of film craft, a performance like this-- stunning and breathtaking-- is that rare and precious jewel you always hoped you'd find",Boys Don't Cry

The beginning of the film is a little slow, but very quickly the story draws you in until you are virtually drowning in a whirlpool of varied and extreme emotions.  When you are released at the end of the movie the emotions give way (at least a little bit) to all sorts of thoughts about American society, hatred, identity, ignorance and sexuality. And not since Secrets and Lies has an entire cast so successfully acted out a story, transporting you into that fantastic place where you forget you are in a theatre. If you need to renew your faith in movies, go see this one.",Boys Don't Cry
288,starcrossed,Excellent! Wonderful! Amazing!,10,2 April 2000,"""Boys Don't Cry"" is an excellent telling of the true life story of Brandon Teena.  Kimberly Peirce did a terrific job in bringing the character of Brandon to life through both her script and her directing. Hilary Swank is amazing as the transgendered Brandon.  She really convinced me that she was a boy in the movie.  I don't think any other actress could have brought the character to life any better. Exceptional performances from the rest of the cast, as well, especially Chloe Sevigny as Lana Tisdel. A powerful, moving film that should be seen by everyone.  If you don't leave this movie feeling somehow changed, then you didn't really watch it.",Boys Don't Cry
289,gmeche,"A complex work of manipulation, betrayal, acceptance and redemption",10,30 April 2000,"I came to this movie relatively late, having waited for the release of the DVD.  I had heard all the (deserved) praise for Hilary Swank's and Chloe Sevigny's performances.  What I was not prepared for was the calibre of performance turned in by the other members of the cast.This was a difficult script to bring to life.  Although its centerpiece is a love story, these two lovers are surrounded by a world of paradox: attraction/repulsion to Brandon Teena by everone else he comes to meet which is their direct response to Brandon's manipulation of them.Alicia Gorenson quickly made me forget ""Becky, 'the First.'""  I was thrilled to see that she has grown into a delicately subtle character actor.  Her re-embrace of Brandon following her betrayal of him was a heartbreaking depiction of redemption.   I was prepared for Brandon's fate, but not for hers.Being from the South, I confess I know people like the characters represented in this film; and I can say there was deep compassion in the dimensional performances turned in by Brendan Sexton III, Matt McGrath and Jeanetta Arnette (who was really playing my cousin Callie - perfectly).Then there was Peter Sarsgaard.  Here was the presentation of the strongest and most dangerous paradox in the film.  The first time he appeared there was good-ole-boy admiration in his eyes for the ""little dude"" taking on the oversized bully.  Then a few moments later, a look of enchantment at his sight of Brandon's tiny hands.  Sarsgaard orbited Swank like an unstable moon around a planet, pushed and pulled by forces over which it can have no control.  There was more than a hint in this preformance that John Lotter might have loved (insofar as he could) Teena Brandon - had he met her.  The revelation of Brandon's physical gender becomes Brandon's betrayal of him. His despair at this knowledge is devastating.  He can only react like an uncomprehending beast to a hunter's wound.There is a quality I have come to regard as the highest an actor can possess.  It is, plain and simply, courage.  Paradoxically, it can only exist in an atmosphere of total protection.  Kimberly Peirce certainly provided that world for her actors.  She has given us a film with meat on its bones and a great loving heart, and one that perhaps could change us for the better if we let it.I apologize if I seem to have neglected Chloe Sevigny and Hilary Swank in my comments here.  It is just that anything I could say would be redundant.  I can only hale the two of them at the start of their illustrious careers (after God-only-knows how many ""overnights"" they've had to endure).",Boys Don't Cry

'Hilary S.' has played the character exceptionally well. It wouldn't be wrong if i call her Hero of the movie. The movie is based on a true life incident, but what makes it special is that the actors have brought up such real life drama that you just can't stop yourself from sitting up and taking notice. Hilary has succeeded in showing the kind of mental trauma Teena Brandon must have gone through in her life, not being able to identify with the body in which she was biologically born. So she comes up with an idea to disguise herself as a male and she is able to do it. In the course of her adventure with some road romeos she encounters a girl named Lana Tisdel played by Chloe Sevigny. The attraction between the two fires as Lana mistakes Teena to be a male. A silent love affair begins. Teena's world is ruined as her true identity is disclosed to all, including Lana. The story takes an interesting turn when Lana accepts the truth but continues to love Teena. However, the circle around Teena is not able to get over it and in a fit of anger they bring a lot of trouble to her, ultimately ruining her completely. Performance of Chloe Sevigny as Hilray's love interest in the movie is worthy of praise. Kimberley Pierce as a debut director has done a great job.An all in all must see movie.I rate Boys Don't Cry 9 out of 10.",Boys Don't Cry

(Hillary Swank got the job by lying and saying she was from Lincoln). We don't sound like damn Texans around here. Is it too much to ask for Hollywood to at least VISIT the place they are trying to represent? And, most tragic and criminal. There was another person, a third one, a black man, killed along with Swank's character that was completely left out of the movie!!! Can't imagine what his family feels.Trash pure and simple.

297,mignon_meister,a sensitive love story against all prejudices,8,9 September 2001,"It's been one and a half year ago since i saw this movie, but it stills remains like one of the most touching and sincere independent films in the last decade. ""Boys don't cry"" explains the true story of Teena Brandon (Brandon Teena), a young transsexual, who was killed by two ex convicts in a small town. This contemporary tragedy, with the outsider- hero who has to break the rules (the common formula boy-meets-girl is substituted for girl-meets-girl), is a consequence of the usual intolerance against the difference. Ignorance always leads to fear, prejudices should be fought with understanding. Although BDC develops a great narrative (introduction of the character-transgression-tragedy), its form isn't much far away from tv movies. But in my opinion the best in this movie are the performances: Hillary Swank is a convincing heartbreaker lad (she definitely deserved that oscar), and, of course, Chloë Sevigny. She was absolutely adorable as a naive lovesick (almost sublime). I truly recommend this movie for all supporters of indie cinema.",Boys Don't Cry

Even though I knew the outcome before I saw the film, Pierce sets it up so that you get so involved in the story, you are still shocked when it happens. The acting was amazing as well. Hilary Swank, one of the most feminine actresses in the business today, pulled off this performance as no one else could. She was rightfully rewarded with the Oscar. I am so glad that an independent film actually got the recognition it deserves. Sevigny, Saarsgard and Sexton also pull off amazing performances. The realness and grittiness of the film fit so naturally into it. To anyone who truly appreciates movies, I recommend this film.

300,getmebeforeigetyou,a stunning movie,8,6 January 2007,"This movie has me moved more than any other movie before. I saw it quite recently, 2 or 3 weeks ago in my psychology class and first i thought it would be one of the most boring movies ever. But hell was I wrong. I'm not even going to start praising Hillary Swank and the other actor's performance because I would only be repeating what countless people before me have said. But still I feel like I have to say something about this movie's emotional power. When i left the classroom after the end, i was stunned. I couldn't grasp the sheer violence of John Lotter and Tom since i knew that it was based on real facts. The explicit rape scene shocked me since I am a woman and bisexual myself. I sometimes don't feel well in my body but never thought about dressing as a man... but what if? The question came to my mind later on. I also know that this is a movie and as such there will always be slight exaggeration but even so i could only shake my head disbelievingly. What also struck me was Teena Brandon/Brandon Teena's desperation to be considered as a man. She just couldn't live her life as a woman and therefore did everything she could to be and stay male.Finally I have to say that this movie is not made for everybody. I agree that this is/was a story that had to be told for it simply can't go unknown now that i saw and thought about the movie. But as I said not everybody should watch this incredibly shocking,touching and moving masterpiece. There were some in my class that couldn't attend school for a few days because they just couldn't move on after having seen the movie. First i shook my head about that but then i downloaded the song ""Bluest eyes in Texas"" and suddenly it all came back to me. And i couldn't help but cry. In hindsight I can say that the movie made me feel helpless in various ways and even though I didn't like the movie from a cinematographic point of view I still gave it 8 out of 10. It tells an uncomfortable truth and i think we can't close our eyes in front of this tragedy... this would be way too easy!",Boys Don't Cry

Being different never is easy, but if additionally are oppressed and misunderstood... She/he was so brave. The most dreadful thing is the fact that all of it was true.

It's not a fun movie at all, and it is horrible cinematography wise. The beginning moved way to fast to understand what was happening, so when the middle of the movie arrived, you had no understanding of the characters at all except for Brandon. Nothing is explained, so when the graphic violence scenes come, they don't have as much import as they could have because you can't sympathize with the characters, who are all repugnant, stupid hicks who's actions have almost no motivation other than drugs. Also, as a reviewer said, ""The horrific ending means that Brandon Teena deserves our sympathy, but it does not follow that the film dramatization based on her life's story is worthwhile. ""For example, we meet Candace in a bar, where he has 12 seconds of dialog with her before a bar fight breaks out. After they flee the bar, they drive 70 miles (from where? to where? we don't really know, the movie is so vague) He wakes up in a field, meets Candace's baby, then that is all the character development she gets. It isn't even clear what their relationship is? are they friends? are they seeing each other? They mentioned marriage, are they married? did they get married in between scenes? from the way this movie jumps around, it's possible. Then they meet some other people (from where?) at a bar, and Brandon starts living in their house, or something. He hangs out there a lot, as does Candace. He calls the older women in the house ""Mom"", but it is not said what their relationship is, but she can't be his mom. Then there are two guys, or maybe there were 3, I couldn't tell because their personalities ran together. They drink all the time, and are violent, and appear to not be related with any of the other people in the movie. Why the mom puts up with them is unknown. While there is no character development, there certainly is a lot of time spent watching rednecks do redneck things. What was the point of the scene with the truck riding? It was really long, and didn't tell us anything or advance the plot. The scenes in Boys Don't Cry seemed to be chosen out of a hat, or maybe recalled by one of the actual people years later, from under a drug induced haze. Then the movie shamelessly uses horrific acts to try to make us care about the characters, but it is far to late for that. Instead, it just sickens and shocks us with the vile acts portrayed. The movie seems to have been made simply off the murder at the end, and written backwards. The first hour of the movie was filler about Brandon's life. I feel like the writers didn't want to give the characters any depth because they had already killed them in their minds.Yes, Hilary Swank was good, but a Swank does not a movie make.",Boys Don't Cry

Because part of the movie takes place in a rural area, I guess the directors/producers think that the populace is dumb; thus, they give them southern drawls.This is offensive to me on two fronts: First, I was raised in the South, and I see this 'dumb hick' stereotyping as condescension--nothing new, of course; it has gone on forever. Anyone who has a southern accent is an idiot, in the eyes of Hollywood. Secondly, it is simply inaccurate. People in Nebraska don't say, 'lahhhht' for the word, 'light,' and so on. The whole movie was made laughable by the ridiculous attachment of a Southern drawl to almost every character! This is not to say that the characters were anything but low-life, ignorant fools; most certainly were that! Their lifestyles--the constant smoking, drinking, drugs, loose living, etc.--made them stupid, however--NOT their accents.

308,user-27588,Cruel Mother Nature!,10,19 August 2008,"This movie highlights, through a serious and tragic true story, the gender ideology of ensuing specific norms set by the society for the two separate genders. When Teena wants to live her life 'his' way, she has to face all the opposition and finally ends dead. In the movie, the social beliefs are so strict that though Teena enjoys all the fame and love she gets from the act, she can't help feeling a little guilty at times. She blames it to be a 'Sexual Identity Crisis' and lies that she has some sexual deformity even though she's physically a perfectly normal girl. Teena was really popular as long as she was able to hide her real self but the moment her 'friends' know that she is pretending to be a boy, they all turn against her. They all question her and John and Tom even brutally rape her. Only Lana loves her just as a person, not caring if she's 'half monkey or half ape' and Teena loves her back. So much so that she tries to continue to fake a male identity and the two plan to elope from Lana's family. It shows that obsession can drive one to do unimaginable things and cross all limits. It is also about the search for one's true identity. All the characters in this film are lost and confused thus leading depressed lives, but Brandon was the only one who realized it of herself and tried to fight for happiness. They are enraged upon the revelation of Brandon's true identity. It left them to confront their own flimsy identities. It is interesting to see that even such 'dark' people are able to out rightly declare Teena as a social reject and shoot her dead. At the end of it all, in spite of her deceptive and criminal deeds, we are forced to empathize with Teena in her struggle with this cruel world disapproving of trans-gendered people. Such examples force us to ponder if it is really apt for 'Mother Nature' to imprison us in these bodies of particular 'sexes' while bestowing upon us this wonderful gift called life!",Boys Don't Cry

314,ClockworkClementine,Disturbing and Powerful,9,2 October 2005,"I picked this video up by chance having heard of the hype surrounding Hilary Swank and her Oscar. I was unaware of the story at the time and went home to watch it straight away. For the next two hours I was totally moved and disturbed by this true story. Hilary Swank (Million Dollar Baby) plays a transgendered woman Teena Brandon, who cuts her hair, dresses as a guy and goes by the name of Brandon Teena. After been saved in a bar room brawl by volatile John (Peter Sarsgaard), Brandon takes up his new friend's offer of a trip to Falls City, Nebraska, accompanied by John's mates Tom (Brendan Sexton III) and Candice. A devastating decision.There he is introduced to another friend of John's, lonely ""trailer trash"" Lana (Chloe Sevigny)- a girl who is bored with her life. Brandon becomes a popular new addition to group and soon he and Lana (unaware of his true gender) fall for each other and enter into a sexual relationship. Following a minor traffic offence, Brandon's true identity is revealed and events take a dramatic turn. Furious at Brandon's lies, Tom and John strip him to prove to Lana that he is a woman. They then proceed to kidnap Brandon and rape him. Brandon reports the rape to the police, who are less than sympathetic, and retreats to Candice's house where he plans to stay the night. Despite being revealed as a woman, Lana demonstrates her love for Brandon by visiting Brandon at the house. There they spend the night together and agree to runaway. However, when Lana goes to collect her belongings she discovers John and Tom, in an attempt to cover up the rape, setting out to find Brandon. The film ends with Brandon and Candice being brutally murdered at the hands of their former friends, leaving Lana devastated at her lover's side.This film is incredibly effective, if a little factually incorrect. The last half an hour (following Brandon's reveal) is very graphic making it an extremely powerful piece of film making that is hard to watch. The love story between Brandon and Lana is touching and yet there is always a feeling of impending doom lurking. Hilary Swank's Oscar was most certainly well deserved. She is totally believable as the charismatic young man Brandon, yet you are always aware of his vulnerability, particularly following the horrific rape. Chloe Sevigny, Brendan Sexton III and the superbly menacing Peter Sarsgaard are also exceptional in their supporting roles and deserve as much credit as Swank. Be warned, this film is not for everybody, especially those who are easily affected- the language and sexual content is explicit. However, I would advised anybody over 18 to watch it(keep in mind it is a true story) and I defy you not to be moved.",Boys Don't Cry

As a girl always dressed up and acting like a man (not a trans man though) and living in a conservative community, I have added this movie to my watch list a long time ago. Former friends of Brandon, the lead character of movie, raped and killed him, because he was a trans and he lied them. It's hard to accept that story is based on a real life, but bullying of LGBT people was real. And it's still real. Hilary Swank was great as Brandon, but it was obvious for me that she wasn't guy.

The acting in this film is incredible, Chloe Sevingy is yet again brilliant. Hilary Swank does an amazing job at portraying the deep emotional struggles of Brandon ( although I do wish they would have considered casting a trans actor to play a trans character). No one around Brandon accepts or supports him but his girlfriend (played by Chloe Sevingy). When the small, intolerant town learn that Brandon is trans (he doesn't identify with the gender he was assigned at birth, which was female) they all turn against him. This movie is very honest and genuine, portraying the horrific struggles that trans people face still to this day. From the police man's victim blaming and transphobia to the vile and sickening attack and eventual murder of Brandon. Although this movie is not just about trans struggles, it studies many other issues of being lost and confused but still having hope. I'm sure all audiences will have an emotional response to this movie. Trigger Warning: there is a very intense rape scene, which is likely to distress all viewers. It's upsetting that several past user reviews which I have read on IMDb have been extremely incorrect. To call Brandon a ""girl dressing as a boy"" or a ""girl trying to be a boy"" is very offensive. Brandon was a boy, genitals do not tell you someones gender!!! Also people saying that this is a lesbian movie or that it's about Brandon's sexual identity, this movie is centered around Brandon's gender identity which is completely unrelated to sexual orientation. This movie should teach people about how complex gender really is, and it does it extremely well, while being extremely truthful and blunt. It's an incredible film, but one that will leave you feeling stunned and emotional. You need to see it.",Boys Don't Cry
317,likklegothgirl,A moving film,10,25 October 2005,"I saw this film a few years back late at night on BBC2 (the time when all those unknown gems are shown) and was moved to tears. This movie has an amazingly talented cast, and the plot is perfect, it doesn't move too fast or too slow.This is a film that will make you think, you can't help but start thinking about prejudice in the past decade, so much has changed, but a film like this reminds you that there is still much that needs to be improved.To be honest, having read the description afterwards in the TV guide, i realised that the critic truly didn't do this film justice. Yes, it is shocking, and brutal and violent, and sure, you may want to turn away in certain scenes. But there are scenes that are so tender and beautiful that you won't be able to stop watching.This is a film you won't forget once seeing, as it will hold a small place in your heart until the end of time. This is a film that will move you that much. This film will make you cry, again and again and again.Enjoy.",Boys Don't Cry
318,Raven-of-The-Sky,When's People Gonna learn????,10,11 December 2005,"This movie is the most awesome movie I've ever seen. When it comes to really slamming the point of ""Hate"" in the face of a world that's trying to force ""Conservativety"" in people's faces with no remorse of the damages done by what everyone's supposed to believe is ""right""verses what is considered to be ""wrong"", I therefore question ""How is it that it's okay to Murder someone ""just because"" of their sexual orientation?"" It makes me so sick to my stomach to see so much ""Hate"" still going around like a virus much worse than AIDS, itself!!!! Anyway, I just wonder when's people gonna learn? How many more senseless manslaughtering must we continue to see and hear in the news and in movies like this one, to get the point out? I really can relate to this movie, and a lot of my friends relate to it as well. Even my own girlfriend too. She actually walked out of my living room near the end of it!!!! I'm angry, outraged and everything else, because all the ""Hateful"" Assholes, in this world still haven't learned. They still cannot get the point!!!! They are the real one's who's tearing the very grounds of ""Humanity"" apart. It's not people like Brandon Teena who had to be slautered and raped and beaten far beyond what I can explain. I can only say one thing though: ""If God's gonna punish anyone, it's not gonna be Brandon Teena. No it's gonna be the dirty bastards who did her in, the one's who are rotting on death row right now!!!! And I know where Brandon Teena's at right now, and it's not in Hell!!!"" So get the story right you Conservatives Idiots!!!! Because Hate isn't Humanity, it's Humanity in decline...Hopfully someday we'll all be safe from people like the sad majority of Society... Really, this is the best movie I ever seen to try to get the point out. Go see it, if you haven't done so already. Despite how angry you'll get...it's well worth it!",Boys Don't Cry
319,annabellemeyers,Let this movie change your life,10,17 July 2018,"Powerful, terrible, true. This is the story of a boy who was full of love but could not live because the world was too full of hate. Every performance is subtle and heartfelt. Perhaps the casting would be considered problematic now, but please consider that in 1999, Hilary Swank wasn't a big movie star looking for an attention-getting role. She was a serious actress given the then almost nonexistent to work on something deeply powerful about an oppressed community, and she put her whole self into it. The writing and directing are so empathetic, this is a shining achievement in the pantheon of queer cinema.",Boys Don't Cry
