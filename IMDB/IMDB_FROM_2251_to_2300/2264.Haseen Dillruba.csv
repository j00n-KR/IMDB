0,Fella_shibby,Predictable but engrossing with a dash of the 90s erotic thrillers.,8,3 July 2021,"The movie is very well shot n at times it is funny but my only crib is the predictable ending. They cud have made it more darker or poignant.Pannu is amazingly hot but the absence of Emraan Hashmi n his smooches will be felt here.I liked the locations n the houses. I wonder if those kinda houses, the river facing houses does exist?Haridvar is on my travel list aft seeing this movie.",Haseen Dillruba
1,RosanaBotafogo,A wonderful and surprising police drama...,9,10 July 2021,"A wonderful and surprising police drama, despite machismo being intrinsic in Indian culture, here we have an almost independent woman, however the cuisine still enslaves many women, but the apex is the mystery, the suspense surrounding her husband's death, murder or not , very engaging, detailed reported, through reports and flashbacks, fantastic, intelligent, engaging...",Haseen Dillruba
2,Foutainoflife,Enjoyable But Drawn Out,6,5 July 2021,Story isn't awful but it's lengthy. It could be due to the 3 or 4 music video montages. It seems that a lot of Bollywood films have these montages but I'm not used to them. I liked it regardless.,Haseen Dillruba
3,arungeorge13,The only redeeming factor here is Vikrant Massey's believable performance! [+33%],3,4 July 2021,"Haseen Dillruba is as B-movie-ish that a B-movie can get - there's frenzied love, a murder mystery, an extra-marital affair, tonal mismatches, sketchy characterization, and a barrage of thriller clichés. Out of the 3 leads, Vikrant Massey is the only one who holds up his end of the bargain, performance-wise. Taapsee Pannu and Harshvardhan Rane fall victim to shoddy writing (by Kanika Dhillon). Even if the film's internal commentary on masculinity and arranged marriage can be tolerated to an extent, director Vinil Mathew struggles in handling the rapid tonal shifts - from a family comedy to a bawdy B movie to a twisted thriller. I felt the makers spent too much time building up the tawdry romance (and its subsequent failure) that the murder investigation bits appear rushed. The supporting characters are all fruits of stereotyping: a silent dad-in-law, a hen-pecking mom-in-law, the friend who comes to drink, and even the carefree hunk who seduces the wife. Every character is straight out of a railway newsstand pulp novel, minus the mere quality of being a page-turner.",Haseen Dillruba
4,kamalbeeee,Average murder mystery..!!,7,4 July 2021,"A unhappy married couple faces trouble after husband's younger brother enters into their life.. Lateron when he starts to tease and blackmail her then husband killed him and try to escape from that murder sentence..
Good story but not intergued thriller..
Screenplay was very slow and bad character definition..
Worth watch for timepass..!!",Haseen Dillruba
5,ketgup83,"With solid climax and electrifying performances, Haseen Dillruba is a definite watch",7,2 July 2021,"A wife, girlfriend or a murderer ? Taapsee Pannu, Vikrant Massey and Harshvardhan Rane starrer Haseen Dillruba explores the who-done-it-murder which is a slow burn thriller with a solid climax.Rani (Taapsee Pannu) is hitched to Rishu (Vikrant Massey) in a compromised arranged marriage (Rani wanted an adventurous and hot guy while Rishu wanted a simple and homely girl). Due to different nature and thinking, things do not go down well between Rani and Rishu and soon their marriage turns rocky. Enter the cool and handsome Neel (Harshvardhan Rane), cousin of Rishu bhaiya, who arranges the seasonal rafting session for the tourist in the beautiful city of Jwalapur (close to Rishikesh in Uttarakand). Neel uses his charm on Rani and she being unsatisfied physically and mentally from her husband, falls for him. Rani wanted to confess everything to Rishu about her affair with Neel but Neel ditches her mid-way and runs away.Now, Rani is feeling guilty about what she did to Rishu, wants to rectify her mistakes to which Rishu forgives her and both eventually start living peacefully. However, one fine day as Rani steps out of her house, a blast occurs which kills Rishu on the spot. As the police investigation begins, all the eyes turns on the prime suspect Rani and her lover, Neel, behind the murder. Has Rani actually killed her husband with the support from Neel or is she a victim of an extra-marital affair gone wrong ?From the director of likable, Hasee Toh Phasee, Vinil Mathew is back with a murder mystery, Haseen Dillruba, which is backed up by Aanand L Rai under his banner Color Yellow Productions. Haseen Dillruba was supposed to hit the theaters on 18th September last year but was pushed to 2021 eventually hitting the OTT platform.While the trailer of Haseen Dillruba was edgy setting up a mammoth expectation, the movie starts on a slow note. In fact, the first few minutes is about boy meeting girl followed by a typical song and drama which could have been cut short and come straight to the point. However, it is the second half when the murder mystery gathers steam especially towards the end with a good twist and satisfactory ending. If Haseen Dillruba could have been trimmed by few minutes and unnecessary songs, the impact could have been more considering the plot was pretty strong. Editing could have been sharp while the music by Amit Trivedi was just about okay.Despite the hiccups, there are silver linings in Haseen Dillruba which makes it a good watch - Kanika Dhillon's (behind Manmarziyaan and Judgementall Hai Kya) novel based story, Jayakrishna Gummadi's eye-catching cinematography and background score which sets the mood of the film.Haseen Dillruba is uplifted thanks to the shinning performances by the star cast. Vikrant Massey's acting is applauding. From being a soft-spoken shy guy to an angry-infused husband, Vikrant's transformation is exceptional. Taapsee Pannu is outstanding who puts in effort and clearly shines as Rani. Aditya Srivastava as the investigating officer is brilliant. I wish the makers could have included more scenes for the exemplary actor. Harshvardhan Rane does fine in a small role. Yamini Das as Rishu's mother brings some humor to the dark murder mystery.Overall, Haseen Dillruba may not be a perfect who-done-it murder mystery thriller but still has enough juice to keep you entertained. Good 3/5",Haseen Dillruba
6,nadkarnisumeet,Taapsee is good. Haseen Dillruba isn't.,4,3 July 2021,"Haseen Dillruba review :Supposedly a dark twisty murder mystery with an emotional angle of unrequited love, Haseen Dillruba ends up a hotch potch of neither this nor that!! The writing (Kanika Dhillon) and execution (Vinil Mathew) fail the film badly even though it has its share of few positives.Like Taapsee Pannu for example. The talented actor rises above the inane plot to infuse some 'jaan' in to her ill written character. If not for her, Haseen Dillruba would have been reduced to a B grade Kanti Shah fare where a newly wedded lady has an affair with her hubby's cousin (Harshvardhan Rane). Hubby dear (Vikrant Massey) gets to know of this extramarital but loves his wife too much to leave her...A murder takes place soon after and the police inspector (Aditya Srivastava from CID tv series) suspects Taapsee to be the killer. The actual story is narrated through flashbacks in course of this investigation.With its genre shifting narrative, Haseen Dillruba goes horribly wrong with character graphs of Taapsee and Vikrant making it impossible for the viewer to connect with the film as a whole. A soft docile character suddenly hatches a plot to kill someone. Another person, thought to be strong willed, turns sissy towards the end. In short, every single character in the movie is unidentifiable.Vikrant and Harshvardhan are strictly okay. They aren't the ones to be blamed here. The script is. The background score jars. Ditto the songs appearing out of nowhere. The cinematography and the scenic locales count amongst the films positive.Taapsee is known to be choosy about her films but evidently, she erred as far as Haseen Dillruba goes. This one will join the ranks of those David Dhawan innanities (Chashme Buddoor, Judwaa 2) she worked at the beginning of her career. Better luck next time, lady!!Regards,
Sumeet Nadkarni.",Haseen Dillruba
7,SoumikBanerjee25,I Was Quite Taken Aback by Its Across-the-board Demonstration!,7,13 July 2021,"Following the huge influx of unfavorable opinions all over the Internet, I genuinely felt apprehensive! Not only because I had greater expectancy but also for the appetite that I do happen to have for Crime Thrillers in general. Therefore, going in; I was bracing myself for nothing but another setback. Entirely unaware of the fact that I was about to get pleasantly surprised!The film is not close to being anything remotely bad. Instead, I would go as far as to say this was freaking ambitious! Of course, not without its fair share of loopholes and impediments; But in all honesty, I was quite taken aback by its across-the-board demonstration.Be it the critique of Arrange Marriages in a rather cunning fashion or the denudation of the unpredictable human psyche; the Writing here effortlessly takes on such toilsome topics. It also goes on to exemplify the likely consequences of miscommunication in a relationship or simply the lack of it. And the inescapable adversities they might face, owing to their poor decision making.Articulated frames that knavishly mimic character disputes or the Screenplay's effective portrayal of repressed emotions; There is enough technical competence to brag about. Songs are uniquely placed and their stirring composition faithfully coincides with all the explicit narrative setups.Coming down to Performances; Vikrant Massey comes across as the star of the show! Now with consecutive displays of his acting chops; Vikrant has already proven his mettle, no doubt about that. Despite not being able to bring her A-game this time, Taapsee Pannu does an admirable work nonetheless. Whereas Harshvardhan Rane was at a complete loss.In conclusion, this is definitely an acceptable crime thriller with some terrific intricacies. Not to mention, its predisposition towards self-evident subtexts that corresponds to Relationship tutelage and fresh starts.",Haseen Dillruba
8,DogePelis2015,A new Indian movie on Netflix,7,5 July 2021,It is a very entertaining and exciting experience; it has a very tense plot and the performances are good; I recommend it if you like Indian movies a lot.,Haseen Dillruba
9,cseabhi,A pleasent surprise,7,29 July 2021,"This is one insane Bollywood thriller - you'll might love the movie after seeing the unexpected finale. The film is enjoyable to see for its clever use of 135 minutes to blend suspense with sarcastic humour.There are actually three winners in the movie. Apart from Taapsee Pannu's powerful performance and Vikrant Massey's brilliance, there is Kanika Dhillon's writing which is very brilliant.Yes, there are flaws in the script and the story but despite its flaws, ""Haseen Dillruba"" is a pleasant watch.",Haseen Dillruba
10,dy38493,Good movie from tapsee,6,6 July 2021,Good movie to watch for the performance from tapsee and vikrant the movie has great music but it is not a suspense movie to deal the movie is clean and clear.,Haseen Dillruba
11,msunando,"Don't just be in awe of her beauty, please do something about it!",7,6 July 2021,"Rani (Taapsee Pannu) is the Haseen Dillruba in this film helmed by Vinil Mathew. So enamoured is Rishu (Vikrant Massey) with her, that it doesn't take him a moment to say yes to marrying her - it's like a dream come true. For Rani though, it's marriage of compromise into the smaller town Jwalapur and to an individual who may be a cult dreamer and absolutely wrapped around her finger, but an absolutely insipid and unexciting gentleman. Perfectly mismatched, Rani and Rishu commence their marital journey, peppered with a one-sided aggression and utter mayhem being caused by discordant notes. Consummation....... oh! Let's not talk about it! Rani knows nothing about household chores, much to the chagrin of Rishu's mother, and uses her skills to try new style experiments on her father in law with her salon experience.So when Rishu's cousin Neel (Harshvardhan Rane), a tall, dark, handsome and muscular guy comes to stay with the family, Rani finds him irresistible. Sparks fly, landing Neel and Rani into a passionate physical affair that they keep under the wraps, but Rani falls in love with him. As she admits her love, Neel scoots without a trace, leaving Rani shocked at her unrequited feelings. Consumed by guilt and remorse, Rani confesses her adultery to Rishu, expecting him to explode. But Rishu doesn't react immediately, instead, he goes into a shell further, exacerbating Rani's guilt. But Rishu is human too, and he wouldn't let this matter pass by. He plans to deliver justice, in his own way. Rishu doesn't forgive Rani, she has to measure up to him this time. Is Rani's guilt a facade and can someone as docile as Rishu avenge his humiliation? Haseen Dillruba begins with a bang - a gas explosion that has obliterated Rishu and Rani's home, and Rishu has been charred to death. What follows afterwards is pure pulp fiction.Well then, Haseen Dillruba is pulp fiction for you. Police Inspector Kishore Rawat (Aditya Srivastav) is convinced beyond all doubt that Rani is the mastermind of the blast and had killed Rishu with a blow to his head before the gas explosion. But neither is he able to find the murder weapon nor is he able to make her admit to the crime. It's all a labyrinthine mystery. The film is thoroughly entertaining, but could have been kept at least 20 minutes shorter. It drags during the extramarital affair, making us wonder if things are likely to go the way of Tagore's ""Charulata"" (filmed by Satyajit Ray), but there's no scope of sensitivity in the adulterous relationship here. The suspense is kept intact by Mathew until the very end, but for the discerning audience now used to watching gazillions of psychological thrillers, crime series and murder movies, the plot may alreadyvhave become predictable. The point is to wait and watch if you were correct in guessing what happened. Vibrant Massey nails it with his beguiling smile and a role that oscillates like a pendulum between submissive love and vengeance, he is at his best. Taapsee Pannu in the titular role shines as usual, it's one tailor made for her, demonstrating oomph, aggression, passion and helplessness. Yamini Das as Rishu's mother Lata is pure joy to watch. Daya Shankar Pandey and Aditya Srivastav offer able support. But the star of the film are the screenplay & dialogues by Kanika Dhillon, who has been dubbed the ""Dinesh Pandit"" of Haseen Dillruba by Taapsee Pannu. Watch it to discover who Sri Pandit is.",Haseen Dillruba

14,sriramthestranger,Vikrant Massey - WOW!!,7,4 July 2021,"This murder mystery drama revolving around the 3 persons has its own moments of 'suspend from reality' and being realistic. The screenplay shifts between murder mystery and family drama, and the writing and cuts are brilliant to keep you engaged. I really liked the Vikrant Massey character's ups and downs, it is one of the rare husbands written well in Bollywood. Do watch and you wont be disappointed!!",Haseen Dillruba

16,rehmankhilji,Aaahhh Boring,3,25 July 2021,"Ok, will give that the murder mystery was carrying a lot of suspense, but apart from that it was completely, utterly and totally boring cinema.It was some what predictable, however, there is an element of surprise at the end for mystery lovers, but apart from that, the movie is completely not my cup of tea for certain.Would not recommend.",Haseen Dillruba
17,pranayjalvi,Disappointing and Dull,3,2 July 2021,"Haseen Dilruba was dull, disappointing and mostly illogical with cringe dialogues and weak plot. The first hour was nothing more than a parody of marriage with neither laughs nor story, while the second half somehow managed to bring the suspense, but to no surprise at all.Taapsee Pannu starrer, Haseen Dilruba had a weak plot, with no proper character development and leading itself to a half cooked, poorly written unsatisfactory ending.My Rating : 1.5/5.",Haseen Dillruba

19,akhil027,Huge plotholes. But entertaining script. Decent acting,6,3 July 2021,The writer should make Rom-Coms or full on comedy entertainers. Crime thrillers are not her forte.The plot stands on the lousy Forensic work or the non existence of it.The jokes were so good though. I laughed a lot. It can be good if you don't look for logic.,Haseen Dillruba
20,virindra,It had some good moments.,5,6 July 2021,"This movie is about a woman who gets married with a good man and cheats on him with a bad guy. The thing I dislike about bollywood movies is that it is either black, or white. There is nothing in between. When you see the good guy, you see this well dressed man and you hear flute music (what's that about?). When you see the bad guy, you see this big muscular man with tatoos. And there is where the story fails.It is quite obvious what the good guy is nog dead. At the beginning the police finds his arm with the name Rani tattood on it. When did the good guy decide to put his wifes name on his arm? Nowhere in this movie you get to see that. Only the bad guy had tattoos. But at the end, and that's the weider thing, the good guy chops offs his arm (who in the world would do that?) with a tattoo he would never take because he is a good fellow.The police only matched the good guy to Neel's body due to the tattoo. They did not take any dental records. Only the arm survived. If that is the case, the good guy was very stupid to chop off his arm. He could have blown away Neel en run away with Rani with both his arms.Weird story, stupid plot twist.",Haseen Dillruba

22,sunildaswaney-63642,SENSELESS ENDING,5,10 October 2021,This movie at best was an average with matching performances.

However the end was quite stupid and forced you to stretch your imagination to accept same which finally proved impossible to do.,Haseen Dillruba
23,nidhunmoviebuff,A convoluted mess despite an earnest performance from Vikrant Massey,6,4 July 2021,"Director Vinil Matthew's romantic thriller Haseen Dillruba had all the right elements-two capable leads and an interesting premise, but manages to reduce to a below average experience due to flimsy storytelling.Vikrant Massey and Taapsee Pannu star as Rishu and Rani, two polar opposite characters who enter into an arranged marriage. While Rani is a flamboyant romantic, dreaming about a man who can woo and entertain her, Rishu is a shy, introverted everyman who inevitably can't manage to excite her.From the initial comedy sequences about the young couple's troubles the movie quickly switches over to the thriller genre as the problems get compounded with the entry of Rishu's cousin Neel (Harshavardhan Rane).While the first half is moderately enjoyable due to the crackling chemistry between Massey and Pannu, the screenplay loses cohesion in the second half.The investigations scenes are poorly choreographed and do not provide requisite tension and suspense. The twists seem force fitted and inorganic and by the end, you are left wondering what was all the fuss about.While Vikrant Massey has excelled in his role as the neurotic and fussy Rishu, this film has perhaps exposed all the limitations of Taapsee Pannu as an actress.She may have excelled in movies like Pink and Thappad where most of the heavy lifting was done by the excellent writing and direction. In Haseen Dillruba, where both arenas are lacking depth and a nuanced performance was required to sell the audience the storyline, Pannu ends up being lackluster.Not recommended. Give this one a miss.",Haseen Dillruba
24,rahul000994,"A Solid, Engaging and Gripping Romantic Thriller !!!",9,3 July 2021,"Rani's (Taapsee Pannu) married life has much less action than the gritty crime novels she is a fan of. While Rani is fiery and seductive with a history of multiple flings, her husband Rishu (Vikrant Massey) is the quintessential good boy nerd, who toes the line. But soon Rani's seemingly simple life finds a lot more action than she had bargained for, when Rishu's hunky bad boy cousin Neel (Harshvardhan Rane) comes to stay with them for a few days.Director Vinil Mathew and writer Kanika Dhillon take us into the starkly different worlds of Rani and Rishu that has the simplicity and relatability of a small town and at the same time, an eerie sense of the looming disaster waiting to happen. This in itself lends the film's non-linear screenplay an undercurrent of tension and constant suspense. This makes it quite engaging, entertaining and unpredictable for the most part, as we see the lead characters go through their journey of love, lust and desires. There might be a point where you'd have cracked the plot, but that won't be a big spoiler.Because at the heart of this twisted love story are strong emotions and flawed characters. Like the strong and stoic Rani, played efficiently by Taapsee Pannu. A lot of the film's suspense hinges on Taapsee's pitch-perfect expressions and the way she deals with the uncomfortable graph of her character. It's hard to read and hence hard to play, but Taapsee makes it look effortless. She makes Rani look seductive and desirable with conviction and not at all distasteful. Vikrant Massey is aptly cast as the mild-mannered yet assertive Rishu, who talks less, but says a lot through his eyes. Kanika gives them nicely etched characters and ample scope to develop through the narrative that builds slowly yet sharply. They also get to mouth colourful dialogues (Ankana Joshi) attributed to the imaginary novelist 'Pandit Ji.' Harshvardhan Rane does well within his limited scope for performance.Among the character actors, Yamini Das as Rishu's raucous mother, brings good comic relief and innocence. Music (Amit Trivedi) and cinematography (Jayakrishna Gummadi) compliment the film's contrasting tone.'Haseen Dillruba' has its moments of being preposterous and unbelievable, but it never stops being a delectably dark and defiant love story with a thrilling twist.",Haseen Dillruba

So if your exposure to cinema is limited and you're not a die-hard 'John Grisham-Dan Brown person' then definitely watch the movie.I for myself absolutely loved it, from end to end.

31,matrixdukenukem,Ek Dilruba Hai,8,2 July 2021,"After Judgemental hai kya, writer Kanika Dhillon pens another mystery thriller. I have not seen director Vinil Mathew's other work Hasee toh Phasee but for this project he does an okay job.Tapsee Pannu marries a simple man Vikrant Massey only to fall into lust with Harshwardhan Rane. This affair starts a chain reaction of passion and betrayal. Overall, the plot is bold and as intended looks like it's out of those B grade novels you can get at railway station. If not for Netflix, I don't think this movie would've released. Thankfully it did and we get to see Tapsee in a brand new avatar. She is marvelous, hot and passionate. Vikrant Massey is charming, scary and believably madly in love with his wife. Harshwardhan does a good job but he's shadowed by the towering performance of leads.I hated the background music. Songs were forgettable too. Dialogues were good and production design does superb job of setting stage of a north indian gully and middle class household.Sadly the twist didn't work for me but it didn't matter because overall the movie is very tight and keeps you engaged in the story itself. Performances by leads and side actors sprinkling humor in between kept me entertained.Overall this is a bold and fresh weekend watch and a good romantic thriller.",Haseen Dillruba
32,madanmarwah,"Love, passion gone all wrong",7,18 July 2021,"This movie keeps you glued with its taut storyline as we follow Tapsee Pannu in her most sensuous role so far . The story is about a middle class arranged marriage gone wrong as the simpleton of a husband ( Vikrant Massey) fails to perform ( pun intended) to his wife Tapsee's expectations and on a rebound she has a fling with a 6 pack possessing Harshvardhan Rane who is more than willing. Like all stories of forbidden love, things go horribly wrong and Tapsee finds herself in deep trouble with the law.Director Vinil Mathew keeps the audience hooked with suspenseful scenes. It is good that he has concentrated on the main plot and kept away from the usual box office trappings. He has obtained excellent performances from both Tapsee and Vikrant specially towards the end. This is a meaty role for both artists and they have done full justice to the demands of the screenplay.The film does not drag anytime and the story flows smoothly. Where the director falters is in scenes of police officer's questioning of Tapsee which are artificially done and look ridiculous. The direction and dialogue in these scenes is found lacking. The film has excellent technical qualities and the cinematography is top class.",Haseen Dillruba

PAGALPAN KE HADD SE NA GUZRE TOH WOH PYAAR KAISA, HOSH MEIN TOH RISHTEY NIBHAAYE JAATE HAIN! ... The tagline aptly justifies this thriller starring Tapsee Pannu, Vikrant Massey & Harshwardhan Rane.A marriage of 2 individuals whose personalities are poles apart. An introvert husband, unsatisfied wife, handsome lover, a torrid affair and finally the husbands murder. This is the story in a nutshell. Nothing new here, but it is the acting and the fast paced narrative that keeps the viewer's engaged.The chemistry between Vikram Massey & Tapasee is just awesome. The awkwardness, frustration, love & pent up emotions are very well conceptualized and enacted. Harshvardhan Rane as Tapasee's loverboy has done a decent job with his small role.Even with the ending being a bit over the top, Haseen Dillruba is a decent one time watch

40,butravi,2 hours cooking of 2 minutes story,1,4 July 2021,"""Lamb to the Slaughter"" is a 1953 short story by Roald Dahl, where a leg piece of lamb (frozen in a freezer), is murder weapon. But that was a short story, based in USA, and at a time without 2021's crime scene forensics.This movie idea is copied from that story, but (copy) writing credits are given to Kanika Dhillon. As usual in copied Hindi movies, no mention of such inspiration.But that's just one problem of the movie.. the other problems are, trying to create a khichdi (mix up) story for 2 hours with this thin premise.When the script is such a lousy one, no amount of talented actors or settings can save it.It's really sad to see all the efforts of so many people going to waste, because of stupid script.It's going to be a flop.. watch it at own risk!",Haseen Dillruba
41,dkgupta493,Thrill and suspense,10,4 July 2021,What director say at the starting don't believe on that because it does not connect to the story at the climax you will be very shocked that the murder is someone else and someone else has been murdered so it is a very tricky very twist and turn and very entertaining movie.,Haseen Dillruba
42,anikb-87099,Astonishing ending!,7,2 July 2021,"The entire story NGL is quite engrossing. Not a single moment of boredom while highlighting a swinging love story along with the society issues like age old expectations from an indian wife to male toxicity.Also the first 35 mins or so it really hilarious especially Vikrant's mom brings in the maximum laughs. However....The ending is something many will talk about and seriously i felt it was a bit too much despite also having the feeling the it was sleek and smart to deceive the audience. Not revealing much, i would say i really loved the way the murder weapon was disposed off.Somewhere in the middle i felt things were going a bit too illogical and completely unrealistic.Overall, a decent one time watch.",Haseen Dillruba

Harshvardan and Tapsee are just ok.Movie is very similar to Ittefaq but there Siddharth, Sonakshi and Akshay Khanna kept you hooked unlike Haseen Dilruba as it gets boring in between.The murder mystery is not bad but as I mentioned it is very similar to Ittefaq.",Haseen Dillruba

46,itsallaboutflicks,Not very Haseen!,6,11 July 2021,"It is abundantly cliched yet an entertaining watch, at least for the first half, but falls flat perhaps due to a predictable, over-the-top second half. In spite of a believable character development of Vikrant Massey and a relatively pacy chain of events, it fails to be Haseen because of a number of loose ends in the plot and unwelcome patriarchal ideas that it promotes.Spoilers alert:-The first half managed to grab my attention, mostly due to a credible cast and a relatively pacy chain of events, in spite of being abundantly cliched. Another aspect that I liked was the development of Rishu's character, from a charming, innocent bloke to a unhinged, scary geek. The shades of transformation were portrayed effectively, in my opinion.There were far too many loose ends in the plot though. The police have been shown in a bad light throughout the flick, which seems to be quite far-fetched. Also, why on earth did the couple keep a big, raw, uncut mutton piece on their freezer, especially when it could bring back memories of Neel-Rani to an already delicate Rishu? And to think Rishu swam across the turbulent, mighty Ganges with an arm short, is ludicrous.I also had a problem with the patriarchal ideas that the flick promoted. The plot was immensely biased towards Rishu. One got to feel sorry for Rani, who is forced to marry Rishu, having arranged by her parents against her better judgement. But an inadvertent mistake by Rani makes us feel sorry for a broken Rishu, who would then go on to cause her relentless physical harm. But we are still made to think that's ok because she deserves it?I kept pondering why Rani wouldn't just leave Rishu, given the liberal thoughts she possessed, at least at the beginning. But then, she too may have been influenced by the society and its ill-conceived notions. Else, why did she even bother to cook for Neel, having previously abhorred the idea? I'm surprised that Taapsee Pannu of all people, found no problem with the script. But then, it is fiction and there should not be any questions asked.",Haseen Dillruba
47,prasadandre,Amazing story telling,8,6 July 2021,"Rani and Rishu at the beginning seems so relatable, How a new married couple gets comfort?

Every time I see her on screen she plays a totally different character and smashes it each time. When I saw this out I just knew it would be good. This film did not disappoint in-fact exceeded my expectations as it was different to anything I've seen before. I loved the comedy scenes with the mother in law.

52,puranjanbasak,This is pulp fiction bro!!,9,2 July 2021,"Haseen dilruba is a romantic thriller with the romantic angle magnified. There are more positives than negatives.Acting:vikrant is the star here. Every expression,every stare is so intense. The character transformation is well depicted. Taapsee and harshvardhan have done a wonderful job too. Tapapsee shines in the emotional sequences specially. Yamini das is so hilarious.Music and bgm:amit trivedi is a bankable member now. U cannot expect bad music from him. The bgm is decent too.Cinematography and atmosphere: the cinematography is superb. The river plays a special role. Every character is like a river. They flow with time on the desired path. The atmosphere has been built up good.Humour: the humour was pretty hilarious. Specially the scenes with yamini das. She was top notch. But i felt the bgm was overused a bit. U dont need to give quirky bgm and music to make the audience chuckle nowadays.Climax was top notch. Many will say it was predictable. Yeah i agree but it will catch many people offguard.Though not a masterpiece but it is an engaging pulp fiction watch. I rate it 9 out of 10.",Haseen Dillruba
53,Perspicuity1,"Science, logic & morals get murdered in this poorly made film.",4,8 July 2021,"A man and a woman, with nothing in common get married and are unable to ignite any kind of spark in their marriage. A second man enters the story, and the married woman falls for him because he is much more attractive than her own husband. Soon, their affair becomes common knowledge to everyone, and that is all what there is in this story, apart from the twist in the end. This movie is a drag, it moves at the pace of a soap opera. Even the end is quite unconvincing and extremely stupid. 'Haseen Dillruba' keeps talking about an author called Dinesh Pandit and his erotic thrillers, the characters take inspiration from one of his books, and the creators of the film want us to believe that the investigators are as stupid as the readers of those books. What was the need for Rishabh to cut off his hand in the end ? There is a thing called Forensic Science, clearly the writer of the film has never heard of it. Rishabh cuts of his hand, jumps into the water and survives.....How ? Any normal person would have died due to blood loss. But it seems the creators had more faith in the stories written by Dinesh Pandit than Science and logic.Kanika Dhillon, the writer of this film, has repeatedly tried to present her female protagonists in all her films as feminists who don't intend to stay confined to the rules that govern our society. But in doing that, she has only managed to write terrible characters who neither have any morals, nor do they have any respect for the people living around them. After watching all the movies written by her so far, I am beginning to question as to what does she want to say through her stories ? In India, it's rare to find a female centric film or one that has a female perspective as well, so it's great to see that Kanika wants to change that, but her idea of feminism is completely wrong. As far as acting performances are concerned, Yamini Das and Vikrant Massey have done a pretty good job, but Taapsee disappoints. Taapsee has been doing some really good films of late, and she has some really interesting projects lined up as well, but 'Haseen Dillruba' has unfortunately turned out to be a misstep.",Haseen Dillruba
54,kinshuk-gaur,Boring and predictable.,4,2 July 2021,"A thriller should be fast paced and engaging this movie fails on both the fronts.Movie starts on a promising note but the weak story, poor screenplay and direction does not add to its cause. .

55,sanjeevanwar,Jwalapur ka Kahar,4,2 July 2021,"Anwar Says: What I call this story, a murder mystery, a perverse edge or a relationship kitaabi drama . The suitable title would have been 'Jwalapur ka Kahar' than 'Haseen Dilruba' ,the Netflix release today. Even the screenwriter as per credits should not be Kanika Dhillon, but Dinesh Pandit , the pulp crime writer.Movie starts with an intriguing beginning and goes back to six months back , where a generic simpleton guy is looking for a bride . Comic begins and continues for half an hour. Then , entry of a macho man , where Tapsee Pannu finds her warped desire. In between, every now and then, Mrs. Dhillon keeps you telling that it is a dark murder mystery. An irritating Inspector keeps on asking ' Tumne apne Pati ka murder kyun kiya ' and he gets the answer in Pandijitji book after five years and that too after his transfer.Vikrant Massey has done justice to his character. Ms. Pannu is not upto her potential, mainly because the loose direction of Vinil Mathew. Was not expected from director of Hasse toh Phansee. I praised Amit Trivedi's music in my last review of GRAHAN but here it is loo time in every song . Background score is sometimes so loud and unnecessary that it chews the dialogue.Failed to understand two LL in the title, probably influenced from Ekta Kapoor's extra K. Watch it if you are Tapsee Pannu fan but even she would disappoint you.#Netflix

59,mayankshukla1404,"A dark, edgy, unpredictable crime thriller!",7,8 July 2021,"It is not easy to review a film that leaves you with mixed feelings. I think Haseen Dillruba worked fine as a dark crime thriller. It is a refreshing take on love, lust and infidelity albeit a darker one. Tapsee Pannu & Vikrant Messey stole the show with excellent performances. The story by Kanika Dhillon had me hooked for the major part and stayed pretty much unpredictable until the climax. The film has flawed characters and is far from perfect but then which film is. Amit Trivedi reliably gives some lovely music which is another positive. The climax is what I found a tad underwhelming. It was extreme and disturbing but then such is love that can make you do eccentric things. Overall a largely satisfying and watchable affair by Vinil Mathew.",Haseen Dillruba

This movie is fun to watch.I've been watching so many movies from India lately, and i am drawn to this genre. Drama, thriller, dark comedy, horror. And i guess this movie delivers its point quite well. Although the female lead character could act better. She was bit 'flat' in this movie.As someone (not from India) who grew up watching many Indian movies in the 90's, i must say it's actually getting better and better

It's available on Netflix now. It's a mystery thriller film starring Taapsee Pannu, Vikrant Massey, Harshavardhan Rane and Aditya Srivastava (our very own senior inspector Abhijeet from CID). A 28 year old Delhi girl married a simple loving small town guy but she's highly dissatisfied with this arranged marriage then she got involved in an extramarital affair with her husband's relative. And the story goes on.The movie starts with a bang and proceeds without straight forward story telling. But it loses its grip after a while. There are many loopholes which make the film more illogical. Sometimes I felt that, I was watching a B grade movie. Taapsee and Harshavardhan's performances are very average. Vikrant Massey is the star here. He puts others in the shade. The storyline could have been far better. It's poorly executed. Character development is pathetic. The film was supposed to be thrilling but it is gonna simply bore you.According to me, ""Haseen Dillruba"" is not engaging at all. You can easily skip this. Do not waste your valuable time over this film.I have some serious questions:1) Who the hell wants to continue the marriage where the husband tries to murder his wife several times?2) How does a person survive for so long after chopping his hand on his own? How's the person able to swim in this condition?3) Rani's mother and her maternal aunt were always available on the phone for Rani.

He is the typical ""nice guy"" who goes crazy when faced with rejection. He scared me with his performance. That's how good he is.Now to come to the negatives (heavy spoilers here)* The storyline could have been far better. It's poorly executed. Character development is pathetic and regressive. There are so many plot holes in the movie such as -* Why did the inspector only interrogate Taapsee's character throughout the movie and not conduct a proper investigation by questioning the family members, friends, neighbours and colleagues?* Why would Taapsee's character, someone who is shown to be brash and independent from the get go, stay with her husband (VIkrant's character) even after he tries to injure her and even kill her?* The forensic guys did not check that the dead body and the hand do not match as both men are physically different. Even a simple fingerprint checkup would have exposed the mismatch.* How is Vikrant's character able to escape and swim despite suffering from shock, and acute blood loss after having his hand cut off?* Despite knowing that Taapsee manipulated the results of the lie detector / polygraph test, the police still let her go.",Haseen Dillruba

Their character transformation , interactions and expressions are praiseworthy.But rest of the movie is garbage. Pretty generic characters for an Adultery theme ,any depth to characters should be credited to the actors not the director.Some of them got no character at all like the father !!!It seemed like the Director was not narrating a story he laid out his worst fears as a man, in front of the audience - The Husband who can't perform in bed, The typical wife getting attracted to a sexy Hunk,The Stud is without soul. As always why the another man is always without heart and a brute?You want it easy that's why . You don't want to face the challenge of what happens if the wife falls for a good guy.That is why Anna Karenina is arguably the greatest novel ever written and Hassen Dilruba is a cheap rip off of it.If you don't know how to make a thriller then why waste a good drama over it? It could have been an evergreen movie but the Director is so stupid he tried to merge drama and thriller together. The result is disastrous.In the very beginning the Director shows what's gonna happen and in the next scene he blatantly gave out the clues of how it gonna happen !!!! Then next to next scene he confirmed who is gonna do it !!!Above all the director tried to make it look like an atypical Bollywood movie but the truth is that it is just another Bollywood garbage . Bollywood's lust for happy ending is so evident in this movie. To give it a happy ending the Director tailored the characters,their motives ,their occupations everything !!!

94,shadabsiddique,Haseen good movie,8,5 July 2021,Tapsee and Vikrant stands out. Good story. Worth your time. I liked the character of Vikrant's mother.Not a single scene that will bore you.

99,ravikumarchandran,Almost liked the movie!,5,2 October 2021,"For a movie with a big underlying crime as backbone, this has a great grasp on the difficulties of newly married couples. The initial difficulties were well laid out. The hesitations of both are nicely shown and I almost liked the movie. The entire crime brings down the quality of the movie to a run-of-the-mill level. The story could easily evolve in to the couples misunderstandings and how time shows best and worst qualities and how they come to term!Taapsee was a one-trick pony with almost the same expression through out the movie. The editing and the story line gives different meanings to the same expression in different scenes. Vikrant fitted the role nicely and gives a decent performance.Loved the performance of Yamini Das!Overall, forgettable movie!",Haseen Dillruba
100,ShriArunKumar,Its like reading a terrific thriller novel.,10,2 July 2021,"Just saw Haseen Dillruba on Netfilx and I'm in awe.The best thing about Haseen Dillruba is its story. Kanika Dhillon has written a fabulous story. Watching it feels like you are reading a novel and its an amazing experience.Taapsee Pannu made me fall in love with her. Her expressions are to die for. She switches between funny and serious, nice and cruel, with her eyes. And you'll continously try to guess what she would do next. Vikrant Massey, Harshvardhan Rane and Aditya Srivastava also play their part very well.The twists and turns are in abundant here and it is not easy to guess what is gonna happen next. And that is the best part of Haseen Dillruba. You'll continuously try to guess and continuously be surprised.Watch it for the story.",Haseen Dillruba

Everything is good about this movie whether it's the cinematography or acting or the music.It feels like a great chance missed because of the ending. And also the fact that he keeps loving her even after finding out about her cheating. That is something hard to digest no matter how big your appetite is.This movie could have been so so special only if the ending was not as crazy they showed.,Haseen Dillruba
103,mystiquebhusri,Unexpectedly good!,9,4 July 2021,Finally we get to see something new from Bollywood and what surprised me was that how the movie kept us engaging and twisting the story at every turn.

115,mezbahshikder,Nicely done ✔,7,4 July 2021,It was good to see that some Bollywood directors could make something else than a as usual stupid Romantic love story.

120,vinayningoo-03478,Good until first half.,5,26 July 2021,HASEEN DILLRUBAVinil Matthew brings you a good movie to watch and a great entertainer until first half. The second half of the movie is predictable and in certain areas one cannot digest Rishu (vikrant massey) chopping his hand off for Rani ( Taapsee pannu ) who has already ditched him once.But vikrant massey is wow. To rate him in one word i ll call him an ARTISTE not an actor. There is a difference between an actor and an artiste and Vikrant massey is a true artiste. Great to watch him in his natural flow & easy going atttude in the movie. Great location where the movie is shot. The first half is just enjoyable and well handled direction wise. The second half is just predictable it could have been better. I love the way they have shown the family from interior parts of India and a middle class family and not some one from metro urban cities which is a good change.Taapsee pannu is good and bold and how she slowly brings out her real self of being outspoken to being caught and then numb and quiet to realizing her fault. Neel (harshwardhan Rane ) was wasted for his potential and could have been used in a better way for the looks and muscles he has.****A good entertainer and a great one time watch during weekend.****,Haseen Dillruba

123,jaggsmca,Good movie for a weekend,8,3 July 2021,"Well nothing new in the story but still telling the story is new way. Acting skills from vikrant, tapsee and who played vikrants mother (dont know the name) had done brilliantly. Story is similar to murder but in background and different ending. But will not sure not hate tapsee character at the end not like mallika sherawat. Also vikrants character is like boy next door and he played well well. Very nice one over dialogues many places. May not be a must watch but even it wont spoil your. 2+ hours and a good cinema.",Haseen Dillruba

Highly predictable.Now few spoilers with less revealing,If the suspect shown initially is missing, why doesn't police try to find him, where is his family, why are they not worried. What is police doing.Internal family affairs shown in an Indian household which is talk of the street but none of the elder of the family involved.So much fighting, glass breaking shown in climax but none of the neighbourhood heard anything in a small gully.Police just relying on stories, no crime site deep investigation, not sure if they did the post-mortem or not.Very poorly depicted.

Her makeup was horrible. Even the supporting artist looked under stress. No natural acting. Story was worth hauling for. I mean really what kind of story it was. So confusing.

What kind of dangerous, twisted messaging is that?Abuse is not love. Anyone who harms their partner is not a ""good guy"".And just because she made the stupid mistake of having an affair with a complete jerk, doesn't mean she deserves to be physically and mentally harmed!In a country where a large number of women suffer abuse and are killed by their husbands, a movie like this is extremely irresponsible.",Haseen Dillruba

147,angelina-72990,Madness in Bollywood,1,4 July 2021,"The movie revolves around a central theme of love. Although Bollywood once again proves that it is clueless about love, relationship and people.Rani is a modern woman who is pushed into arranged marriage. And like all modern women, she doesn't cook or clean or knows basic stuff. Because ofcourse modern people do not know how to take care of themselves.Rishu is an engineer who likes to repair electrical stuff in his free time. He constantly harps on the fact that he is an engineer *coughs* *loser* *coughs* *crybaby*.. Since the day they get married, he has been shown repairing one cooler on terrace, which by the end of the movie, is still under repair.So, like all Indian men, he has expectations that his wife will do all the heavy lifting around house, like cooking, cleaning, probing, handing him his handkerchief, wallet, etc when he leaves for office. But Rani is modern. And he is ancient. So they never communicate about their expectations and feelings. Because bollywood.Enter Neel -stubble, shades, tattoos, backpack and YOLO vibe. Rani is immediately swooned. Plus he gives Rani the attention she deserves. And before audiance starts rooting for him, he turns into a shady guy who takes off without any reason.Long story short, absolutely no effort has made in the story, character development or acting.Watch for picturesque location and nothing else.",Haseen Dillruba

160,ambivert_idiot,A good movie for your weekend.,7,5 July 2021,"Haseen Dillruba is a simple crime mystery movie, but the whole cast's acting dramatically impacts the entire storyline.The movie's first scene creates tremendous suspense for the audience. During the whole film, the audience keeps trying to find the murderer.The story goes smoothly, and some funny scenes are created in the first quarter. Also, some scenes of the movie show the ground reality of middle-class families, like Rishu's mother, who roams around to check the Ladkiwalon ka Ghar with an excuse to go to the bathroom or Rani's mausi advising her to flaunt her cleavage to seduce Rishu, etc.Meanwhile, the story seems a bit slow during the mid of the movie. The story is different from the perspective of every character in the film. If we look at the aspect of every character, the story and the murderer seem different. Taapsee did a great job in acting. Her expressions are unique and according to the situation. Vikrant's acting is also rare. Even his small appearance makes a significant difference in the story. The way he smiles during the sharp turns of the story is killing.A fictional character named Dinesh Pandit plays his role in the background without even coming on the screen. The dialogues are pretty impressive.But the bad thing is some explicit scenes of the movie. These scenes remove this movie from the family movie category.

173,nivesingh,Good performance by Vikrant is the only plus,1,20 July 2021,"I watched this movie due the good reviews written here but I was bored and left the movie halfway. It's a murder mystery but so badly written that I did not even care to see the end. The story is not well scripted, music is not good and Tapsee and Harshvardhan cannot act. Only Vikrant performed well. Tapsee is not a star material, she doesn't have the looks or the stage presence, and she can barely act. Courting controversies to stay in limelight will help her get casted but it will not be able to run a movie, so this movie falls flat. Boring, jaded and get a half star from me.",Haseen Dillruba

I am here to just talk about movie ending where Rishi cut his hand and do the blast at home to make sure people will think that rishi is dead. That thing does not make any sense. What was need lf cutting the head and assuming dead. If they do for neel too the same thing was going to happen. Rani would the part of investigation in both the cases. If they tried 2nd option then Rishi's identity would be alive as well as hand too. Overall its a good weekend watch.,Haseen Dillruba
180,RjNeel,"New Bollywood, my foot. Humraz (1967) was lightyears ahead of this",1,2 July 2021,"One really needs to reassess these ""new"" age actors and ""new"" age films. They promise a new bollywood but deliver poor hollywood rip offs which do not even have the entertainment value of an average bollywood movie of the 90s.When you advertise it as a ""Desi Gone Girl"", you kind of already give away the mystery. Thus, your best hope is an engaging storyline that keeps the audience on the edge of their seats. ""Haseen Dilruba"" does nothing of this sorts. The story never lifts off. If anything they were delivering an incredibly cliched plot revolving around infidelity.It appears Tapsee was straight away lifted from Thappad. Same expressions throughout the film even during supposed humor scenes. All these People like Pankaj Tripathi, Tapsee, Kirti Kulhari, etc are at risk of getting typecasted. They need to grow like Rajkumar, Ayushyaman, Yami or Bhumi Pednekar. It's not enough to just have acting skills.Overall, the movie is INCREDIBLY BORING. Story: Man+Women+Arrange marriage +Kyunki Saans Bhi Kabhi Bahu thi + Stud Guest + Infidelity + Cat out of the bag + Fight + Murder(Whose?) + Happily ever afterAll this complicated with Gone Girl style story telling. Totally UNWORTHY OF TIME.",Haseen Dillruba
181,chandansharma702,High Rating For Vikrant,6,3 August 2021,Vikrant act brilliantly. He is rising star.He need more good story to prove how much worth he is.Starting drama is good written but Tapsee failed to improvise which needs from her side.She is not engage with character and scene. Yes She looks pretty and bold but performance delivery is below average.I felt something is missing in screenplay and direction because sometimes you released from scene and again forcibly you need to engage with story.They are using very limited character but most of character's roles are also very limited means no impression or attachmemt can be found in thiers role.,Haseen Dillruba

There is a time at midtime where you will be impressed by Vikrant's acting but that is because the bar of acting is so low in bollywood. Tapsee have the same constipated expression through out the movie(I guess her career). Rane needs some serious acting lessons. I will say the best actor was Abhijeet(CID Wala). Rating it 1 star as it is already highly rated. Please don't overrate this movie just because of the politics. Accept that Tapsee is not even an average actor.

(finishing could be more reasonable though but undependable and unfair judicial system is liable for that!),8,12 July 2021,"This is the movie that every couple should watch to realise the value of love and trust and also to realise the punishment of betrayal. The actor was somewhat introvert but very hood gentleman . On the other hand, the actress was extrovert. Finally, she realized she has given such an arranged marriage where mis-matched personality can't stay together. She could have shown patience to release Bishu's(the actor) potential that she wanted from a guy. Such a gentleman type guy who never made relationship with females fell into trouble at the beginning from both communication and sexual act. The actress could have waited for this fix but she didn't. She was stubborn and talked his poor sexual performance with her mother, which was a great mistake that every girl should avoid. Such introvert guys get hurt easily. They perhaps dreamt of a great respectable female in their life but in reality, if they found opposite, those introvert guys get shocked and become indifferent to the romantic relationship. This is what paves the way for intruding of a villain who takes this opportunity of a romance thirsty female like the actress. The story of betrayal starts and it almost always ends with a bitter experience and this story is not exceptional! The ending could have been better with a better solution but for this we can't blame the writer, the corrupted and unfair justice system is liable.",Haseen Dillruba

267,akshaykanitkar7,Average: Could have been better,6,10 July 2021,"Taapsee Pannu starrer 'Haseen Dilruba' is not bad afterall. The main problem is with Editing of the film. It could have been much shorter in length if they would have focused on keeping the 'development of relationship' of Taapsee and Vikrant Massey a bit shorter.Also, Vikrant Massey is slowly going the Nawazuddin Siddiqui and Pankaj Tripathi way and his overall acting, expressions and dialogue delivery is getting monotonous.Others did their job fairly decent, however, they didn't let other tracks or characters grow, else it could have been a little less boring.The stereotyping of Engineers was evident only in the starting of the film. Vikrant's love for homeopathy wasn't showcased in the climax. The writers could have easily used Taapsee's love for Dinesh Pandit's novels with that of Vikrant's love for homeopathy in the climax - again a miss on the creativity part.Overall, the film might bore you in parts. If you don't have anything better to do, you can surely watch it.It is surprising how Taapsee is getting angry on not so good reviews of the film, whereas the film indeed had a lot of misses and is far from being perfect.Yes, speaking of her individual performance, she did a fairly decent job, alongwith Aditya Srivastava (CID's Abhijeet)",Haseen Dillruba

287,gautamhazari,This is going to be a Masterpiece for a Chosen Few . . . .,10,4 July 2021,"This is not a romance drama (as expected), it is quite a good suspense / mystery (as expected), but, at least for me, it is something much much more.First a disclaimer: I am sure I would have reviewed this movie very differently had I seen it 10 years ago. 18 years ago, a special friend dragged me to watch Maqbool. I know that was an inflection point; since then the kinds of movies I watch (all multiple times), and like, and especially what I like most about them has changed for good.So what I find the most stunning about this movie is that it first discovers and then treads a very fine line between a romantic drama and a murder mystery. Once it finds that line it does a fantastic job of character development, selection and optimal use of a natural setting, integration as a musical, providing a platform for every actor to excel at acting, minute attention to relevant details, and of course engrossing a person like me into the overall product.This doesn't happen by fluke, over a feature length film. It happens only through a determined, deep and aligned intent across the key film makers.So many reviewers said you won't guess the ending, so I tried (before starting the movie) and got it almost right. I have read all the Perry Masons and Agatha Christies we (mankind) have, so there's plenty of training data to use for guessing. And that's why when I found this other set of aspects I loved, I loved the movie so much.You would obviously ask, who looks at a movie in terms of integrations, treading fine lines, etc.? Well, I do, and I know a chosen very few others do too.So, this is like a beautiful hole in the sky, and the only way to get there is to traverse a narrow ridge between 2 sharp cliffs, just like Nakhind.A personal thank you to Vinil Mathew, Kanika Dhillon, Taapsee Pannu, Vikrant Massey, Amit Trivedi and the other film makers. I am sure I am going to watch and enjoy this one many times over the rest of my life.",Haseen Dillruba
288,shubhamrajpal,Just give it a chance,8,14 July 2021,"Yeah I understand the hate. The plot is a bit unconventional but the movie has several emotions and takes the viewers through a journey it's well written. The climax was like too good to be true scene coz every move of the characters played out to well if it were to be a Hollywood movie people's reaction would have been different just because it's a Bollywood movie ppl won't appreciate it.

This movie is jam packed with entertainment. There is so much suspense and it is so not at all predictable like other thrillers. You don't know wether to love, hate or feel sorry for the characters and your left guessing till right at the end. It doesn't get boring for even a minute. I don't usually write a review for Indian movies as their mostly predictable and drag on and on so I usually don't watch till the end thats if I decide to play it in the first place but this movie I can watch all over again!

Repeatedly.Wife is chill with it, because after all she was the one that messed up.They patch up.A soulful romantic song composed by Amit Trivedi plays in the background.You know, typical married life hijinks lol.If you like reading / watching mysteries, the fact that they only find the victim's hand at the beginning and can't ID the rest of the body should tell you something. It's very easy to see the twist ending long before the credits roll.The mockery of feminism is also a little nauseating. Over the course of the movie, Taapsee goes from ""aap tal lo pakode"" to loving the guy who keeps trying to murder her because ""wo ishq hi kya, jo paagalpan ki hadd se na guzre"". Quite a fall for the star of Pink.My takeaways from the movie:1. Don't neglect your hot wife who's honestly probably too good for you2. Don't cheat on your husband3. If you're a policeman trying to solve a strange murder case and your prime suspect keeps citing a mystery author, read his damn booksVERDICT:Basically, watch this if only if you feel like rewatching Kabir Singh. If you're in the mood for a thriller, rewatch Drishyam or Andhadhun instead. (Actually, even if you feel like rewatching Kabir SIngh, why not just rewatch Kabir Singh instead?

Acting is good and songs are just pleasant. Should watch this your time will not be waste.,Haseen Dillruba
342,subhambbk,Can give a try.,8,16 August 2021,Story looks little unrealistic but actors played their role very well.The way a person chances after being betrayed.The level a common person can go when he is broken.What happens to a woman when she is lonely and not paid attention from her husband.Parents role was quite fake.They should have worked on it.,Haseen Dillruba
343,itzmevaisakhu,It's really good Didn't expect this from bollywood,8,5 July 2021,I really enjoyed watching. Maybe not everyone cup of tea because i see a lot of people's negative comments here.Btw The more you rationalizing the more you move further from your authentic self.,Haseen Dillruba
344,sachadeshbhakt,"Taapsee,vikrat & Harshvardhan all r amazing",10,3 July 2021,We all know that tapsee is brilliant actor. No actress can match her in acting.

Makes for interesting watch but Sorry guys, you cannot take a story and not give due credit for the inspiration! Hence Thumbs Down!The acting is definitely riveting, desi humour brings in a lot of smirks and cackles, movement of the story is well paced, but a few giveaways, like the bag she uses for buying the mutton, specifically the leg of the lamb are dead giveaways!Nice for a weekend watch if you can digest so much hype. Vikrant Massey is definitely the most happening among the new crowd of actors.",Haseen Dillruba
350,sandipnovwishes,I really enjoyed watching this movie,10,8 July 2021,"A well made entertainment
Acting was just amazing in the movie, vikrant and Tapsee drove the movie with their craft, Its fresh to watch the chemistry between them.. story, direction,production,camera work rest all the departments did there job well,this movie didn't require songs but since you have them so thats why I have to say,
wish songs were more melodious, really good memorable songs would have taken this movie in a different level, like raazi, that movie shouldn't have so many songs but they had songs and songs were so melodious they added to the movie.",Haseen Dillruba

I am not a big of Tapse due to her political inclination. However, I still have rated 10 considering the story line, screenplay and superb acting by Vikrant! Tapse has done enough to do justice to her role and facial expressions has improved as compared to previous movies which is applaudable. Vikrant's Mother character was excellent and naturally hilarious!",Haseen Dillruba
360,harishcs,Interesting and Exciting movie.,10,3 July 2021,The movie is worth watching. Netflix has another gem of OTT films.Vikranth dominated all over the movie.

Its time some one sit with her and tell that she doesnt know acting.Predictable at every turn - while continuously begging the auidence for attention .So much that i rather deal with a beggar than this movie again.Usual tropes , 3rd rate actors.Trying to get by with a nip-slip or a saree slip whatever to beg for interest.The end is contrived. Boring.",Haseen Dillruba

366,mehulmanot,Plagiarism again!,5,14 July 2021,"The movie is well-made and definitely one of the better movies lately. Vikrant is excellent, Tapsee is decent, and Rane can barely act. The best act was from the woman who played Raja's mom.The music is not good, except the one in the denouement. The worst part is plagiarism from the writer - Kanika Dhillon.

Bollywood filmmakers, like TV serials these days seem to be hell-bent on focusing on extramarital affairs and justifying toxic masculinity, claiming that they are merely reflecting society. Having such characters is not the issue, glorifying is. This movie is no different. Even with its forced twists and turns, didn't make for engaging viewing. Tapsee is a huge let-down. She is turning out to be a male version of the likes of Akshay Kumar and Sunil Shetty of the 90's. She must watch the performances of her peers in Malayalam cinema.",Haseen Dillruba

417,jaigoenka,Feeble attempt of making movie like Drishyam,6,4 July 2021,For most part the movie was engaging that didnt fail to keep viewers guessing. But when so many storylines with so many angles are there you need an ending that should connect all the dots. But here in the climax it failed miserably if we look at the climax illogically then yes it does connect all the dots but when we talk about a crime thriller what really makes it brilliant is the cat and mouse game and how each tries to outsmart other person. But here the cop was shown a dimwit and It failed to focus on very important questions that any police investigation and forensic department would have. There it was really disappointing.,Haseen Dillruba

1. Where is the defence lawyer in the entire process?2. If a murder suspect, wouldn't the girl's parents/relatives be there to support her through the interrogation process?3. 3rd degree assault on a female suspect by cops is not permitted by law
4. The dramatized end of chopping off the hand was not needed. It was a scuffle in one's own house. The owner has a right to self defence (trespass). The bruises and cuts were enough evidence that Rishu's life was in danger. What happened after can simply be noted as self defence.The actors are good in their roles. Surely worth a watch and the audience can decide whether the logic in the end works or not.",Haseen Dillruba

Harshavardhana not get much screentime but still satisfying cameo kind role which boost up story. The Story Slow begins with love ,then hatred and at end mixup of emotions. Story Is something different which is quite good coz v nt expect that gud stories of movies by Netflix in India. The sTory portrays Love Hate Lust and Finally Emotional. The Best Side is Music, absolutely stunning . You will nt skip guaranteed .You can connect each song with story plot and it's timing situation. In term of acting V. Massey sets fire. Pannu Justify her role completely. Little amount of comedy added in beginning but not satisfied too much. The Screenplay by Netflix always remain Just Like surprise Box.

Yes, it is no masterpiece, but it is a very decent watch. The climax is predictable, however, the journey to that climax is an interesting ride.All the actors have done a good job with Tapsee and Vikrant stealing the show. There are parts which are problematic and give a very ""Love the way you lie - video vibe"", but there are a lot of entertaining moments and some good dialogues.Boredom does not creep in at any point and that is one of the main reaons why you should give this a shot.",Haseen Dillruba

Story telling keeps you involved till the time you are believing in it, and once the belief factor is gone, you are kicked out of the movie. There were plenty of ways to get rid of that one scene which is unbelievable. Rest the movie is watchable for sure. Tapsee, Vikrant, Aditya Srivatsva, Daya Shankar Pandey, Yamini Das and Ashish Verma were at their best. Harshvardhan was okay, maybe because of his role.",Haseen Dillruba

474,saejalbrar,A roller coaster ride,9,6 July 2021,The movie is brilliant in its direction blending the different tones of the story seamlessly. It starts out as a comedy underlining social issues delivered so subtly that you enjoy it without the issue being forced down your throat. Some of the scenes were so beautifully expressed and the direction on the strangulation dream for me was a cherry on the cake. I have never seen love/hate be expressed in such a bold and engaging way. Also commend the lighting of the movie adding perfect spice to the mix. Taapsee and Vikrant were brilliant and almost flawless in their acting.It is a mood ride that you must experience.,Haseen Dillruba

Harshvardhan's intensity is beautifully augmented by the brashness of his character. Sad to see the writer and director not focussing on backing their talent with the script. They end more like accessory to a plot than being party to it.The storyline trying to intrigue the audience leaves several loose ends, where a seasoned audience can see beyond the plot already.Was expecting Tapsee to showcase another dimension to her talent but she has really not put any effort. From Pink, Badla, Manmarziyan and now this. It's a flat line of raised pitched shrills and pursed lip smirks, she has remained consistent with across movies. The expressions are as flat lined and the audience can see the actor acting, rather than absorb the character.Wastage of time and data.

534,violinadas-70872,INTERESTING,9,16 July 2021,This is something for which I was waiting for a long time. Last time I saw her in Thappad.. which was a really powerful story in view of the society. And I was so excited about this one. I really wanted to watch it in the theatre but didn't happen now. Anyway.. just wanna say that it didn't disappointed me. It was exactly as I expected it to be.The thing I loved the most is that it was unpredictable. Just by watching it from the starting you can't predict what was going to happen in the very ending (unless you are an expert). The thing a family want from their daughter-in-law is portrayed just in the most correct way. Character present was excellent. Powerful casting which made the movie more interesting.Worth watching!!,Haseen Dillruba
535,carisamanilal,BLOWN !,7,20 July 2021,"The movie starts as a usual typical Bollywood movie where the guy meets girl as a part of an arranged marriage and the girl turns out to be the typical hot out of league type of a person, and as always the chocolate Boy, decent And homely guy falls hard for her. What's comes next is slightly unpredictable. The entire movie kept me glued to the screen, Made sure I didn't miss even one single moment, and the anxiety of what's next or whoS next was present well within me throughout the movie . Must say an amazing thriller / suspense executed beautifully and the actors gave it life and did complete justice to it. Though the end becomes a bit predictable, it's a must watch. For sure you won't regret watching it.",Haseen Dillruba

Or is the police also working based on 3rd grade novel writers? Best movie on tackling police so far has been Drishyam & compared to that this movie is a 1/10.

552,mueezsiraj,If looks could kill,7,7 July 2021,"""If love doesn't push you to the brink of insanity, then it isn't true love. Only the meek seek refuge in passionless relationships""This is the epilogue of the film which sums up the whole story.Haseen Dillruba - one of a kind murder mystery revolving around 3 characters can be a one time watch in the weekend boredom.Rishu - An innocent guy who tries to win her wife Rani's heart before anything else. Rani who seeks Rishu's cousin Neel to satisfy her libido. Lastly Neel - an offender who runs away when Rani gets serious.The movie with its twists and turns will keep you hooked till the end and some good performances by the leads adds the flavor to the movie.Taapsee - portrays a never seen before sultry character and is sure to have all your emotions. You'll be surprised, in awe of her, then angry and mad too but you'll definitely like her changed version later.Vikrant Massey - A silent and innocent guy turned rogue after his wife's betrayal with his various roles is outstanding. You'll be left to wonder how good it would have been if not for the highly illogical way he thinks of covering up based on Pandit's novel which is the sole part I didn't like in the movie.The reason why villains almost always get defeated in movies is to give a subtle message to the masses that the bad guys are never meant to win. In addition to this, ""Maybe"" the movie portrays how even a small mistake committed out of marital relation can lead to much chaos.",Haseen Dillruba

The whole star-cast of the movie is great with brilliant acting from everyone, just that the story lacked the oomph factor. Expectations were high from this movie.",Haseen Dillruba

564,prathmesh5130,Good entertainer!!!,7,11 July 2021,Love the movie as it was simple and engaging. The climax is predictable. The actors performed really well.,Haseen Dillruba
565,aritra-nag1992,Refreshingly good romantic crime thriller from Bollywood after long time!,8,3 July 2021,"Vinil Mathew delivered a refreshingly good quality movie which is actually engrossing and entertaining during this difficult time is praiseworthy! Tapsee Pannu, Vikrant Massey and Harshvardhan Rane all delivered stellar performance! The benefit of working with actors who can actually act is that you can see some brilliant acting on screen which is getting rarer and rarer these days with all too flashy ""actors"" pretending to act!I wont go into the story which'll spoil all the fun but without spoiling anything I want to say that with all the good points in the story, there are some obvious flaws in it which is too much for the careful audience to ignore mainly in police investigation part which is grossly ignored by director Vinil Mathew as his main focus was on romance and romantic relationships in the movie and their consequences! Climax is the main highlight of the movie which you can't fully guess! A lots of surprisingly good twists are there!! Special mention about Aditya Srivastava aka Sr. Inspector Abhijeet of CID! He is always wonderful to watch though I felt he was very much underutilized in the movie.Overall, Haseen Dilruba is an entertaining crime thriller romance movie which will keep you hooked until the end! You should check it out if you haven't already!",Haseen Dillruba

574,paiashwini,Very unrealistic end,1,8 July 2021,Acting by everyone was good. Especially Vikrant Massey. Taapsee was good but her acting seems repetitive. The ending was very unrealistic and no continuity. For eg what happens to the parents? And it would have been simpler to mark the name with a knife on the dead bodies hand. I don't think a person can survive after chopping his hand and jumping into a river and swimming without cloterisation. Also the body frames of both the men are different so during forensic evidence gathering they would easily find out that it is not Rishu's body. Disappointed😟,Haseen Dillruba

It hits it out of the park as a love-saga,tricky extra-marital affair, and as thrilling crime drama. Its an intelligent, entertaining film that will take you through all emotions, I like films which make you feel, you know like really feel under your skin. This is a love saga that punches the gut out of you. Authentically shot and masterfully crafted be it the earthy humour, be it the dialogues and be it climax the film wins on all accounts and technical aspects. The music in the film is soothing and lovely but the biggest strength of the film is wonderful acting.

It fails to build up that tension, felt too many things were happenin at once.The acting done by the trio was top notch, especially Vikrant Massey aka Rishu, the way he transforms from a simple pretentious guy to a vicious killer. He never overdid the psychopathy-ness that this movie stipulates.

733,Sunenarks,All about madness in love! 5 star for Vikrant !,8,2 July 2021,Story will excite you till the end. Edge of the seat thriller. A thrilling weekend watch. But I don't like Tapsee's acting at all..she looks so confused to where to act what and sizzling scenes were not sizzling at all. She doesn't have that suductress appeal.

Movies like these and talented actors like Vikrant Massey, Taapsee Pannu and Harshwardhan are there to make us believe that we still have hope in bollywood. I read that people are saying that this movie is glorifying toxic love but you know that's the reality of Indian society which this movie is representing.

To start with ""MUST WATCH"" I don't want to be specific by saying one time watch as we all know ""mystery bar bar aap nahi dekh nahi sakte""
Vikrant is new hero to the camp who takes all the attention with his changing sides making us love and hate him at the same time with tapsee bland look making it natural to understand every emotion of her at the end ..
Believe me you will not regret these 2 hr nd don't go after spoiler.. They are just waste of time and money for us as well as for director and writer so please give your time..
Writing too much of review will make me write the climax
So seeya.",Haseen Dillruba
810,lionel-43144,A bit better than average,7,6 July 2021,"First let's look at the negative points of this movie....A) The mystery plot is rather tame and predictable. The trope of using fire to muddle up the investigation by charring the victim's body beyond recognition is a cliched theme from Agatha Christie.B) The character of the detective is rather wasted. Aditya Shrivastava aka our beloved Abhijeet should have been provided with more shades to his character. We only see an arm twisting goon trying to beat a confession out of the Heroine. No legwork, no usage of little grey cells. I think they wasted a goalscorer by giving him the role of a goalkeeper.C) The cliched family drama was just a drag.On the brighter sideA) An unapologetic female lead is always a worthy addition.B) Vikrant Massey was beautiful in wrenching out the hidden shade of his apparently goody two shoes character.C) The so called small town setting and the ode to the pulp fiction writer.In a way it was better than the competition, but for folks who like hardcore mystery/connoisseurs of Scandi-noir will find this weak in the knees. So take your call wisely.",Haseen Dillruba

Undoubtedly, ending storyline was added too much masala & so, became extreme fictious to digest. However the climax picturisation was still enough to make u thrilled.Acting of both Vikrant & tapsee was appreciable, but aditya i.e. Inspector abhijit(CID) was also non avoidable.Ofcourse not to much expected with story.Most of the twist are quite easily assumable for regular movie watchers.

904,ljpino,Deliciously Twisted Love Story from Bollywood,9,2 September 2021,"Pulp Fiction - An approach to storytelling that is fast-paced, a little trashy, with lurid details and overblown emotions, and characters who are not what they seem.'Haseen Dillruba' is set in a three-story house on the banks of the Ganges, in the town of Jwalapur. Jwalapur police officers stand in rapt attention, while Rani Kashyap recounts the details of her short-lived and turbulent marriage. She is being grilled by inspector Kishore Rawat who believes she has murdered her husband in a most brutal manner. Rani is unemotional and dull as if she is in shock. Their story is told in flashbacks.Rani is a city girl from Delhi. Well educated and modern, she enjoys working as a beauty parlor manager, but she is not fond of cooking or housework. At 28, she has had a few loser boyfriends in the past and is feeling the pressure to marry. Rani often quotes her favorite author on matters of love, pulp fiction writer Dinesh Pandit. She yearns for a bold, passionate romance.Rishu is a mild-mannered engineer, who often spends his free time repairing his neighbors' appliances. He also has a broad knowledge of homeopathic medicines. Rishu has very little experience with women. But Rani is beautiful, so it's love at first sight. When their marriage is arranged, he daydreams about their future and has Rani's name tattooed on his wrist.Trouble starts on their first night. Rishu is inept at lovemaking, and Rani is too outspoken. Her pride is hurt as her attempts at seduction fail. He is humiliated when he overhears Rani complaining to her mother. Resentments build up on both sides. Richu's handsome cousin Neel shows up for a short stay. Neel takes tourists river rafting, and he has the vibe of a physically fit nature boy. Rani suddenly develops an interest in cooking. Flirting leads to a passionate affair, but after she confesses her love to Neel, he runs away.The story becomes entertainingly twisted from here and the pulp fiction pot begins to boil over. Betrayal, remorse, rage, insanity, compassion, forgiveness, and redemption are added to the mix. Rani struggles to overcome the hurt, confusion, and shame of the affair. Wounded, Rishu goes into a deep depression and plots to avenge his honor.Vikrant Massey can fit into a wide range of roles because of his everyman persona. Vikrant's Rishu is naïve, shy, innocent, and vulnerable, as well as, hurt, humiliated, angry, pathetic, spiteful, and totally insane. Taapsee Pannu is also fun to watch as a high-maintenance Rani. She plays Rani as confident, impulsive, outrageously outspoken, jealousy, and eventually, with a core of decency and remorse for her sins.Other standouts in the cast: Wellbuilt, self-assured Harshvardhan Rane, perfectly cast as the seductive Neel. Yamini Das as Rishu's mother Lata, is very funny, controlling, and dramatic. Daya Shankar as the Brijraj, Rishu's father, is a quiet, good-natured man who lets Rani experiment on his hair. Ashish Verma is Afzar, Rishu's best friend. A bachelor, Afzar does not hesitate to give Rishu marital advice on 'training' his wife. Finally, Aditya Srivastava, as Inspector Rawar, who obsessively leads Rani through hours and hours of questioning convinced that she is a murderer.'Haseen Dillruba' is written by Kanika Dhillon and directed by Vinil Mathew. It is a movie that has divided critics into two camps: people who hate this movie vs. People who love this movie. It is primarily a relationship/character study in the guise of a murder mystery. I found it a very entertaining watch.",Haseen Dillruba

933,prakashwadkar,Finally a good movie after a long time,10,3 July 2021,"First of all what an acting by Vikrant and Tapsee, beautiful and marvelous performance, Vikrant brings lot of emotions through expressions which is worth a watch. His voice is outstanding it feels very nice to hear his voice... he should be doing more voice over.Tapsee too good..Karan Johar and other bore directors should learn from this, they can still go ahead and commercialize with this kind of movies. You don't need fashionable heroines just for the sake of movie..",Haseen Dillruba
934,sarabjeetchd,Must watch. Getting low score due to politics.,10,3 July 2021,"Vikrant again prooved he is far better than star sons & so called stars of the bollywood. He is a gem.He has no comparison. Presence of this star cast & their acting skill makes this movie watchable.Tapsee & Harshvardhan were also good.Those who love thrillers must watch, it may be predictable at one point for those who watch all thriller movies byt still its a great effort.",Haseen Dillruba

937,nihararora,Amazing Story,9,4 July 2021,"I was really struggling to solve the mystery till the end, I have solved a lot of mystery before the movie ends which sometimes takes me out of the story but this one kept me till the end.",Haseen Dillruba
938,ghoshsoubhik,Good,7,6 July 2021,Story was great.. But director should make Rishu as a Doctor.. It would be easy to survive after you cut your hand if u take high dose of anasthatics.,Haseen Dillruba
939,aakashprakash,Absolute waste of time,1,3 July 2021,"I think Netflix is becoming a garbage bin for Bollywood for throwing every nonsense movies into it. Everyone profits except people whose time is wasted by these nonsense movies. Guess even Tapsee seems to know how horrible the movie is that she hasn't even bothered to act properly. Maybe its time for people to stop calling her a B grade actress and give her the title of c grade actress that she deserves. Lol especially since many are calling this her ""master piece""",Haseen Dillruba
940,sajidali-24908,Something new in hindi movies..,9,29 August 2021,"Well played boys and girls..just amazing acting, fun to watch, it will leave you till the guessing and at the surprises you.",Haseen Dillruba

944,liveeelife,"Great depiction of scenes, mind captivating",10,4 July 2021,Full of thrilling scenes. Love romance betrayal and anger mixed so naturally that it won't let you take your eyes off the screen.,Haseen Dillruba
945,sunilrjpt,Unbearable,2,3 July 2021,Pathetic screenplay i must say and Pathetic acting by Tapsee. It becomes unbearable to watch at many times while watching this movie. Some things are unnecessary. I wish i have checked the negative reviews they are so true. If you have time to waste like me you can go ahead. Vikrant is good always . These 2 stars are for him. Some funny lines from his on screen parents. Thats it.,Haseen Dillruba
946,jayantchaudhary,Below expectation,4,4 July 2021,"Vikrat acting was good. Story was fine but very slow movie. I don't know why bollywood need to show bold scenes in every movie without that movie can be much better, you just need to focus on your content which was missing. Not thrilled. After sometime can easily predict the end so below average.",Haseen Dillruba

950,aishurani,Massey is the show stealer but the story does have some loopholes,6,6 July 2021,"First things first, the backdrop of Jwalapur is beautiful. As someone who has a fascination for quaint, small cities, I loved the setting. Then the performances of Taapsee & Vikrant were outstanding. One can actually feel the pain of Massey as he tries to portray the role of a cuckold & is trying to get a grip on his emotions (by attempting to seriously endanger his cheating wife's life). The last part was toxic.Coming to the story, it does keep you riveted until the end. But it has some serious loose ends :1. How come Rishu's parents or his friend don't have an inkling of what's going on behind his back? After all, it's a small house & the mother-in-law usually knows what her daughter-in-law is upto esp. If she's at home? Even if she didn't see them together, she must've suspected something fishy since Rani was upstairs with Neel all the time. But nothing is shown.2. Rani's mom & aunt were emotionally available to her. How come she didn't share anything with them about Neel or how come they didn't see a shift in Rani's behaviour?3. After cutting his own hand, I wonder how he didn't drop unconscious owing to his loss of blood (?) and there is NO way he was able to swim with a cut hand. As someone who swims, in order to stay afloat, one needs both hands. The part where he was sinking in the river was plausible until they showed he survived! Seriously, one needs to be an expert swimmer to swim with 1 hand.4. After he survives, how come he escapes Jwalapur without anyone noticing it's HIM! After all, it's a small city & the sensational news of his murder must have put him under some kind of radar!5. In the end, he is shown to reunite with Rani but what about his parents?! Did he inform them? Did they stay in Jwalapur? Also, for a mother who has just lost her son, Rishu's mom didn't show a lot of emotion!",Haseen Dillruba
951,sancways,"Encore! Gripping storyline, beautifully edited, invigorating soundtrack.",10,3 July 2021,"Taapsee Pannu has delivered an amazing performance as always. Vikrant Massey portrayed a complex character with great finesse, never before have I seen him shine through the simplicity of his body language. He's earned a new fan! Call me crazy but this is the romance I'd longed to see on screen.",Haseen Dillruba
952,aggideazone,Vikrant is 😍😍,10,8 July 2021,"Thank god, we have Ayushman, Manoj Vajpayee, Pankaj Tripathi. You can watch this just for Vikrant Massy.",Haseen Dillruba

956,shivamhe,"Great acting, good weekend (one-time) watch.",8,3 July 2021,"Tapsee and Vikrant acted superbly, especially in some of the more intense scenes later in the movie. I believe this drove the base of the movie to be so good. I would recommend it to anyone who wants to sit down and watch a new Hindi movie (as there is a lack of them), because it is certainly a 1 time watch. I doubt I'd see this again unless with someone else.If you follow the story, you'll be able to figure out the ending halfway through the movie like I did but a good watch regardless.",Haseen Dillruba
957,bhaswarbanerjee,LOVE-MURDER-REPENTANCE,10,9 July 2021,"A wife murders his husband to marry (rather stay with) her brother in law. If you are interpreting the trailer based on this, man you are living in delusion!!! I haven't seen any better love-crime-thriller in recent times than Haseen Dilruba. Vikrant and Taapsee, the duo gave a phenomenal performance as well as a on screen chemistry. Harsh was once again up to the mark with what was demanded. Direction was awesome, VFX was good and overall, khoon ke chhite na ho toh woh Amar Prem nahi, very well justified!",Haseen Dillruba
