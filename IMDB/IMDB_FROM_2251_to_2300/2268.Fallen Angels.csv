0,Quinoa1984,"a messy movie, but not a mess, this is a film with an attention to its method of its unconventional style",8,27 January 2008,"Wong Kar Wai doesn't play by the rules, and those who respond positively to his films wouldn't want it any other way. While he's recently gone a little more measured and controlled with style (relatively speaking) with In the Mood for Love and 2046, it's mostly in that he's now using things like dollies and steadi-cams. Looking at Chungking Express and, particularly, Fallen Angels, he reveals himself as a filmmaker total in trust with a style that in other hands would be simply amateurish. His camera, led on by Christopher Doyle, follows along these characters like in a slightly feverish documentary, with the accompanied narration adding the emphasis on inner thoughts and details. It's a crime drama, but it's also a fresh way to look at material that has a little bit of quirk, a heap-load of attitude, and at least a good lot of romance, or the lack of it or the pining for it with these characters. It's equally sweet and rough-edged, like an adorable motorcycle.For plot, there's not much: two male characters, one is a hit-man who's starting to feel the pressure of his job (ironically, he describes it as being a good one early on as ""I'm a lazy person. I like people to arrange things for me""), and breaks off from his partner, a woman who cleans up his 'messes' of mass destruction, and then falls for a strange blonde girl. The other is a mute ex-con who robs people by being obnoxious at various one-night-stand type of jobs, and in the process meeting a girl whom has a freak-out one night (there's an amazing scene, I should add, where in one shot we see him fall completely for this girl with a soft blues song playing behind him describe this as his first love). At least, that's as much as I gathered from the essentials; there's also a sub-plot with the mute kid, He Zwhiu, and his father as he starts to videotape him all the time. But Wong isn't interested in plot mechanics as two central facets: mood of a scene on technical fronts, and a sensibility that's close to poetic intent.Wong's camera moves in a way that is a little dizzying, and it feels like it should be a shamble, a fiasco of an art-house item that doesn't transition well to the US. But it becomes apparent that its form is, at least, consistent to the intent at hand. We're so aware of the style that the characters are seemingly organic from this urban, post-modern spread. They're more than a little alienated (watch that shot where the woman is in the café, and the fight breaks out behind her without flinching an eyelash to the situation), and they have the tendencies of youth trapped in a situation they can only break out of (for one it's a way of life as work that gets mixed up due to emotions with the partner, the other with his father and going past disrobing the homeless and conning a family with ice cream).Wong Kar Wai presents this amusingly at times, a brisk sense of humor dropped in to let the audience know 'it's OK to laugh here and there, they ARE human after all with all their idiosyncrasies'. But at the same time there's a sorrow to the material that is given life by the hand-held, by the shots of characters in mirrors, by mixed media, by black and white shots thrown in, by editing that cuts off the head of the 180 degree rule here and there, by pumping in sad music and it does come close to diluting the emotional impact of the characters's fates. And yet, Wong has the soul of a romantic at heart, so to speak, and despite the fact that there's some pretty violence scenes in the picture (done in that hyper-speed style that is a little slow, a little fast in a way, as one has seen in many HK crime films) there's an intelligence that steers it from being TOO sloppy.This may be arguable, to be sure, in either direction; some may even call it a masterpiece of post-modernism as well as those who can't stand it period. I don't necessarily think it's even Kar-Wai's best film. But it inspires so many fresh images and thoughts I can't discard it as a warped slip-up from an otherwise avant-garde darling. If anything a film like Fallen Angels lifts up his reputation as the Chinese answer to Godard (minus, of course, the Maoism and the reading excerpts of books on camera).",Fallen Angels
1,DICK STEEL,A Nutshell Review: Fallen Angels,10,11 September 2008,"I've got a strange affinity with Wong Kar-wai's movies, and they seem to somehow present themselves in reverse order to me, where often I find myself visiting his earlier works backwards. Like watching 2046 first before In the Mood for Love, or right now, watching Fallen Angels before Chungking Express, where I have both movies on DVDs sitting on the shelves, but decide to pick Angels before Chungking, knowing jolly well that this one came after, and was like the film that expanded itself so much that it had to break away and stand alone on its own two feet.Deciding between Chungking Express and Fallen Angels also boiled down to pure laziness on my part to want to pop a Region Free DVD into my default player, hence the latter. And I can't help but to chuckle at how Leon Lai's killer character Wong Chi Ming paralleled this laziness of mine, in wanting things on a sliver platter, of getting the preparation work all set out for him, and he just enters the scene with his swagger as the executioner. And the woman behind him acting as his agent and cleaning lady, is played by Michelle Reis.As his agent, she gets the contracts, does the legwork to draw up plans, and with time as she hangs out at his apartment to clean it up, she nurses an aching heart, knowing that perhaps in their profession, to fall in love would spell doom. And it doesn't take one too long to identify with such longing, of being so near yet so far, and she exorcises her unrequited passion by either visiting the places he visits just to hang on to his lingering presence long after he's gone, or by pleasuring herself on his bed. Kinda kinky, don't you think?While Chungking Express dealt with the relationship issues that two cops had to experience (from my fuzzy knowledge of it anyway), Fallen Angels seemed to be its evil twin, again dealing with relations of the heart, but now from the viewpoints centered on two criminals, one in Lai's character, and here the other in Takeshi Kaneshiro (who was also in Chungking Express) with his mute He Zhiwu, who breaks into shops and plays plenty of make belief. In his story arc, his unrequited love stems from his chance encounter with Charlie Young's Charlie, who too suffers a broken heart, but goes over the bend. In fact, I would have thought that Eating Air took a huge leaf out of certain aspects of their courtship, especially with the lovers on a bike careening through Hong Kong's underground highways. And Charlie Young I thought did substantially more than the flower vase roles she's more famous for perfecting.While Zhiwu can't speak, it is perhaps this arc that has a lot to say about love in classic WKW pathos. We listen in to the thoughts of Zhiwu as he narrates them in Mandarin voiceovers, such as topics of relationships having their expiration date, and the keeping of someone's memory alive. With Chi-Ming, he consciously rejects someone who takes an extreme liking of him, to go for a random, temporary lover in the form of Karen Mok's Blondie, who again might be another throwback to a similar character back in Chungking Express. But being cautionary here, is yet again the tale of not incurring the wrath of the wrong woman, though I chose to interpret the events in his story thereafter as being one of a set up, or a fix, versus just being a case of coincidental bad luck.And you cannot get away with not talking about frequent WKW collaborator Christopher Doyle's cinematography in this film, with its obtuse angles like a fish eye twitching all around with plenty of kinetic energy, boasting of shots within shots with its use of captured mirror images. Time lapse also gets used quite frequently, giving it a sense of broad fast forwarding motion, with the devil in the details treated quite casually. With a variation of Massive Attack's Karma Coma by Roel Garcia featured in an eclectic soundtrack, it already bowled me over with its collection of songs featured, whereLove stories that don't go anywhere except to serve as personal reminders, familiar pathos as presented by WKW, a star studded cast and excellent visuals and music, easily make this film one of my firm favourites. I suppose I shouldn't waste too much time before embarking on my journey onboard the more illustrious Chungking Express.",Fallen Angels
2,=G=,Morose and monotonous,6,27 November 2003,"""Fallen Angels"" is outwardly a jittery, nervous, ambiguous, poorly filmed artie with clumsy English subtitles which appears to be a failed attempt to make up for a lack of story with moody visual style. Mostly shot with short lenses (for fish eye type distortion) and video which is either poor quality on purpose or not (does it matter?), the film follows a quartet of lonely night people with some narrated reflections on life from one of the players, a hitman. Bulked up with lots of filler, dull stretched out moments of nothingness interspersed with sudden bouts of action, ""Fallen Angels"" isn't much of a movie but may have some appeal for Asian film freaks who care more about atmospherics than story. (C+)",Fallen Angels
3,gbill-74877,Visually stunning,7,10 August 2020,"Visually stunning, with so many effects and shots - the neon lights, reflections, colors, wide angle lens, low frame rate, handheld camera, titled angles - and they all work without seeming like gimmicks, giving the film great style. I just wish the story and feelings had been as profound as the cinematography.",Fallen Angels
4,alansabljakovic-39044,It is not his best,6,24 March 2020,"I know this is a hot take but I didn't find the main characters intriguing and interesting enough. The ending saved this movie for me from being like a total disaster. I really loved the style of the movie but the lack of me caring for the characters makes this my least favorite Wong movie so far. Also, where are Maggie and Tony???",Fallen Angels
5,gcd70,Thematic yet un-startling,3,4 February 2010,"Desperate account of Hong Kong's subculture of criminals trying to ""make it"" is a painfully meandering, thematic piece that disjointedly makes its way to its un-startling conclusion.Wong Kar-Wai draws his picture out far too much, and the viewer will spend most of a long 96 minutes trying to figure out what the writer-director is up to. His cast seem to do exactly what's required, but what that is, is pure conjecture. Odd camera angles and black and white photography add a touch of ""art"", but again no reason seems apparent.Kar-Wai's main theme appeared to be relationships, though I was so confused at times I could be wrong.Monday, July 20, 1998 - Hoyts Croydon",Fallen Angels
6,RainDogJr,From Hong Kong to the world,10,22 May 2007,"Is a shame that here in Mexico city the cinemas are full of American films, i love a lot of American films but i prefer a film like Fallen Angels or Chungking express than films like The day after tomorrow or Rocky Balboa. Here is very difficult to find a film of Hong Kong in the cinemas and also is a little difficult to find it on a DVD store.But i have the luck to buy Fallen Angels and i consider myself a very lucky person because i have the chance to watch a film like this.Fallen Angels is perfect.........for my is the best of Wong Kar Wai (i haven't see all his films but by now i think that this is the best).Fallen Angels is the story of a couple: a hit-man and his girlfriend, the other character is a mute and a girl that he meets in a store and finally there's another character that is a young lady that spend some time with the hit-man.This film is about love and also about relationships.There are two stories: the one of the hit-man, that show to us that he only see his girlfriend for work and also show to us the lonely life of the two....the hit-man meets this young lady and spend some time with her but nothing serious.Finally the hit-man gets killed.The other is about the best character of the film and maybe the best character in a Wong Kar Wai film : a young mute that in the night have a lot of different jobs like sells ice cream or a work as a barber but the problem is that this aren't his business so he enter like a criminal to this places. Later he meets a girl that always is fighting with her boyfriend and the mute fells in love. He has very good times with the girl, goes to a soccer match and also his hair has become blonde because of the love. Finally the girl never come to the other soccer match because she never love him.Also show to us his relationship with his dad, and how he spend most of the time recording to is dad.......Great character and awesome played by Takeshi Kaneshiro (Chungking Express).Finally his dad die and he spend a lot of time watching the tape of his dad........finally he meets the hit-man's girlfriend and he starts to hanging around with her.Well this is a great story but i love a lot all the characters and for me that is the best part of the film.If you want to see one of the greatest love stories and one of the best films ever you must see Fallen Angels...another masterpiece of Wong Kar Wai.Also the best scene in the film is when the mute is watching the tape and remembering his father and also when he meets a boy in the barbershop and later he meets the same boy with his family in the ice cream truck.FALLEN ANGELS 10/10",Fallen Angels
7,crossbow0106,Hong Kong By Night,7,4 April 2008,"Wong Kar-Wei is an acclaimed film director, with many incredible films to his credit, such as ""Chungking Express"", ""In The Mood For Love"" and ""2046"", amongst others. This story is mainly about Ming. a hired killer who tires of the game. This stylish film is set at night, and its sinister overtones are effective. Hong Kong has never looked this forbidding. That being said, to me, its not one of Kar-Wei's essential works. You are not supposed to like Ming, but you are also supposed to care about him as the main character, and I don't. By the end, I grew kind of tired with the style of the film, possibly too much of a good thing. By all means see it, but just know that there are veritable classics Mr. War-Kei has done. While good, the film doesn't reach that platitude.",Fallen Angels
8,khanbaliq2,"Arguably the apotheosis of the Hong Kong auteur's hyper-kinetic, pop-informed style.",8,13 June 2010,"Fallen Angels is an exhilarating rush of a film, with all manner of go-for-broke visual bravura that expresses the free spirits of bold young people. A disillusioned hit-man and a former convict look for love amidst the frenetic street life of Hong Kong.The film is a speedy, adrenalin-filled journey though neon-drenched Hong Kong, and encounters with its beautiful people. Its style trumps its story and fittingly, first impressions count for everything. Fallen Angels can be seen as a companion piece to Chungking Express (1994). On January 21, 1998, the film began a limited North American theatrical run through Kino International, grossing US $13,804 in its opening weekend in one American theatre. The final North American theatrical gross was US $163,145.",Fallen Angels
9,The_Movie_Cat,"Good, but not exceptional",7,16 August 2000,"An arty, pretentious, foreign-language film with subtitles? Normally this sort of cod-meaningful, film student work would be right up my navel-gazing street. However, I'm not sure if Duoluo tianshi (Fallen Angels) ever hit the spot for me. At least, not as much as it did for Michelle Reis.The film revolves around three characters in separate areas of Hong Kong's underworld. Leon Lai is Wong Chi-Ming, a hit man and sometimes ""debt"" collector, who works with the masturbating Reis as a partner in crime.This element is probably the least successful, if in part due to its overstated direction. Most of it is shot in a fisheye/keyhole lens style (i.e. whatever is nearest the camera is larger and distorted). This is interspersed with slo-mo, crooked angles, high-speed, black and white and killings heavily indebted to John Woo's pre-US work (Ying Huang Boon Sik, et al). Credit must be given, however, for the documentary-style realism, particularly the way ""blood"" spatters on the camera. Not a gore-enhancing spray, but minute specks, giving a subliminal illusion that what you're watching is real.Takeshi Kaneshiro appears as the most likeable character, an insane hyperactive who ""talks"" to camera and runs after-hour businesses. That is, when the shops are closed, he breaks in and does his own thing  be it molesting a dead pig in a butcher's, tearing off a man's clothes in a launderette or force-feeding a family in a stolen ice cream van.However, when the gimmickry settles down and you start to become involved with the interwoven storylines, any reservations start to fade. The coldness of two of the three central characters is displaced by the minutiae of the supporting cast. Karen Mok as ""Blondie"" adds humour to Lai's otherwise steely interpretation, while there are touching moments between Kaneshiro's He Zhiwu and his father, played by Chen Wanlei. Many of these scenes are shot with Zhiwu filming his father on videotape, meaning that writer/director Kar-wai Wong gets to intersperse real camcorder footage with the rest of his hand-held studies.Not a first-class view, then, but a worthwhile look at urban violence and inner city alienation. A very well done perseverance, but how cool can something be that ends with a song by The Flying Pickets?",Fallen Angels
10,DukeEman,Art in the violence.,6,12 February 2003,"Another one of those ""intelligent assault senses(!)"" movies that should have been a short film. This film has a mixture of genres but leans heavily on the dark side. Christopher Doyle's photography is basic but the very wide angle lenses he uses works a treat on this. The music is another extra bonus.",Fallen Angels
11,AhmedSpielberg99,"Doesn't live up to the pressure of being a sequel to Chungking Express, but still a very good movie!",7,19 October 2018,"I can see why Fallen Angels is considered to be a follow-up to Chungking Express. In fact, it's kinda set in the same universe; as there are many references, and too many things the two movies share. But Fallen Angels expanded on its predecessor's trippy atmosphere and visual style. The result is an extremely entertaining hypnotic experience that you can't help keeping your eyes glued to the screen throughout its 95-minute run time.From the technical standpoint, Fallen Angels isn't just as flawless, or just as phenomenal, as Chungking Express, but it's actually stand s out from the latter's for being more practical. Don't get me wrong, I don't think that Chungking Express is overly stylized as some people, but in Fallen Angels; the songs, the music, the colors, the use of black and white, and almost everything we see or hear adds to the story, and if not to the story, then to the experience itself. Because Kar-Wai Wong knows how to convey emotions and feelings, maybe more than any other filmmaker!Alas, Chungking Express is far more superior to Fallen Angels from the narrative standpoint. I don't mean that Fallen Angels's script lacks cohesion (I shouldn't ask for that anyway), or smart dialogue (Actually this movie has many great and quite subtle lines), but it, undoubtedly, lacks interesting characters. Honestly, I was quite engaged with the killer's story and his partner, but the mute's storyline and the crazy girl who is getting over her breakup completely annoyed me. At the beginning of He's story, I was actually somewhat entertained. There were some hilarious moments that really made me laugh out loud. But soon I felt that this storyline overstayed its welcome, and I found the whole thing very annoying, and extremely tedious. It's baffling because I think the storyline is well-structured, and everything should have worked very well, but I really don't know why the characters turned out to be unbearable, at least for me.That said, the mutes story has some of the most memorable moments in the movie, besides the above-mentioned funny scenes. Also,Takeshi Kaneshiro, who played He, the mute character, is a remarkable actor, an there is no better proof than the way he changed his reactions and facial expressions by the end of his character's arc.I wasn't surprised that I didn't get moved by the end of the mute's character's arc, but what surprised me is that I felt very little, if any, emotions towards the killer by the end of his storyline. While I found myself engrossed in the killer's story, almost instantly, once the movie returned to it, I think the mute's story detached me emotionally from the killer's. At the end of the movie I was almost entirely emotionally disconnected from all the characters, and the movie left me a bit cold.(7.5/10)",Fallen Angels
12,SameirAli,Experience the night in Extreme wide angle.,9,27 October 2021,"Fallen angels is a very good movie from a wonderful director, Kar Wai Wong. The film happens mostly at night and shoot on extreme wide lenses. It's something that you have to watch and experience, if you love different film making styles.",Fallen Angels
13,socrates4,Another Great One From Wong Kar-Wai,8,26 January 2019,"I watched FALLEN ANGELS after seeing the director Wong Kar-Wai's earlier film CHUNGKING EXPRESS, a wonderful movie that tells the stories of different people living in Hong Kong. That film was originally supposed to include more characters, but some of them were cut out and put into this movie instead. FALLEN ANGELS is not as good as CHUNGKING EXPRESS, but it is still very good nonetheless.These films have a very nice and unique style and pure fun to watch. They have a great energy to them and I have heard that the director makes the films without a clear script, writing basic outlines for scenes the morning of the shoot. The movie takes place all at night and shows the lives of some very interesting characters. Highly recommend.",Fallen Angels
14,InzyWimzy,"Powerful, stunning work",10,29 September 2003,"Wow.  Fallen Angels really surprised me.  I rarely read reviews or synopses of movies before viewing.  So, I expected to see classic Hong Kong shoot 'em up gangsta film.  Instead, I was intrigued and stunned by this incredible movie.The characters are the focus as they each tell their stories.  Literally, the title ""Fallen Angels"" gives you an idea of their plight.  The film doesn't glorify the criminal lifestyle and shows aspects like isolation and loneliness.  It's funny how the killer even tries to imagine how happy he'd be trying to live a ""normal"" life working a 9 to 5.  Unfortunately, life's placed him in his predicament and must deal with the ramifications of it. Add to it his agent (played by knockout Michelle Reis) who is really enigmatic in this one.  Her scene at the jukebox is one that displays the pain, agony, and confusion that she is going through.  Plus, that song is like joy and torture for her at the same time!Then, there is He.  A man of few words who's story may be one of the most moving.  Who could've thought a video could be so powerful and sentimental? This may be one of the most strangest, complex, yet fascinating characters I've ever onscreen.  His silent nature, line of work (which is the oddest form of coercion I've ever seen!), and his struggles are really played well by Takeshi Kaneshiro, especially his scenes with his dad.Wong Kar Wai's direction really makes the film.  I really loved the dark, trippy music soundtrack which helped glaze on a slick, surreal coating.  It sounds like something that would've been produced by Tricky, Massive Attack, or Portishead.  While this may not have a bloody, high body count, the story told here makes this such a worthwhile movie and can be appreciated after repeated viewings.",Fallen Angels
15,barberoux,Tiresome,4,20 February 2004,"I watched `Fallen Angels', (Duo luo tian shi), after seeing director Kar Wai Wong's excellent `In the Mood for Love', (Fa yeung nin wa), and I was very disappointed.  `Fallen Angels' had some quirky and evocative camera work and the story was of interest in the beginning but the movie went nowhere. After the first third of the movie most of the remaining action was a repeat.  Scenes of bored looking people sitting in a bar and the endless cigarette smoking were tiresome.  I ended up fast forwarding through many scenes and they were still too long.  I wouldn't waste time watching this movie but be sure to catch `In the Mood for Love', a sensual pleasure.",Fallen Angels
16,MarcoParzivalRocha,Loneliness,8,31 December 2020,"Hong Kong: a contract killer tries to leave the business, while other side stories intersect and bond with each other.Following Kar Wai's style, this film explores emotions and feelings, in this case, loneliness.Among characters who want to change their lives, others stuck in memories and illusions, passing by personalities who have never created decent and beneficial human connections, there is a seductive and moving narrative that shows us that in a world of encounters and mismatches, in the end we are alone, regardless of what we do along the way.The style of photography, where the camera is very close to the actors, distorting the proportions, leads us to be very close to the events, to easily create empathy and to experience the same as the characters. The score, as always, incredible and perfectly played.",Fallen Angels
17,timmy_501,Wong captures urban malaise,9,23 December 2010,"Although I had seen several of his films before, it wasn't until I saw Chungking Express a few months ago that I encountered a Wong Kar Wai film I found above average. Fallen Angels is loosely connected to that work and it uses a similar structure but it always feels original and unique.The most impressive part of Fallen Angels is the cinematography. Wong, working again with the great Christopher Doyle, breathes life into the garish urban nightscape of modern Hong Kong. Exhilarating shots such as the high speed motorcycle trip through a tunnel lit by green neon are so great on their own that they almost overshadow the visual mastery of the more stationary shots.The characters are less successful in their attempts to make connections here than in Wong's previous film; coupled with the violence, this makes for a darker, less optimistic viewing experience. The most effective scenes here deal with loss as when He Zhiwu, one of the film's two male protagonists, makes a spectacle of himself in front of his ex-girlfriend who completely ignores his antics.With Chunking Express and Fallen Angels, Wong established himself not only as one of the most eminent film-makers of the 1990s but also as the single greatest visual chronicler of modern urban malaise. Not since the heyday of Michelangelo Antonioni has a film director examined alienation with such skill.",Fallen Angels

19,w-71474,Lonely world,10,3 April 2020,"""The Fallen Angel"" is probably about the distance between people. Among Wang Jiawei's works, this film is the one with the most close-up lens. Generally speaking, the closer the lens is to the actor, the closer the viewer is to the character's inner world. Wang Jiawei and Du Kefeng did the opposite. In the film, the character's face or body often occupies most of the screen's space, but in the exaggerated and ultra-wide-angle lens, the character's strangeness and alienation are more apparent. The same is true for two-person shots. Taking Li Ming's encounter with old classmates and Mo Wenwei and Liming for example, the wide-angle lens' excellent depth of space makes the characters look like they have passed away even if they are in the same room. Du Kefeng's shaking lens and mysterious lighting, combined with Chen Xunqi's nightmare soundtrack, add a bit of time and space to the film.
Cross-cutting in different time and space is another means for Wang Jiawei to show distance. The first killing mission in the film is described in chronological order. Li Jiaxin's stepping on the point and the precise execution of Liming let the audience establish psychological coordinates of the two people's workflow. The second killing task was used by Zhang Shuping to use the cross montage to cut the shots of the two people at the same place and at different times. On the surface, the tacit understanding of the two partners is inexhaustible, but it actually reflects that the two can only be in parallel space-time China is doing its best, and has made it clear that their emotional world will not intersect.",Fallen Angels

While it's not as ""perfect"" a movie as 'In The Mood For Love' in the traditional sense, it has a kind of messy punk-like nature which just always appeals to me. Way more erratic in both its tone and playful camerawork but with that same woozy and seductive atmosphere that just sucks you in and doesn't let you go. It's a bit like a French new wave picture updated for the isolation of urban sprawl.",Fallen Angels
21,mighty_pickman,i didn't really like this one,5,25 August 2003,i really had trouble getting into this film.  The camera work is all over the place in parts & the characters are hard to connect to and have any feeling for.

22,tbyrne4,"Ahh, Fallen Angels. What a lovely, sad film this is",10,10 July 2006,"I was first introduced to this film about ten years ago (man, its already been ten years!!), along with Takeshi Kitano by a friend who was really into Asian cinema. At the time Beat Takeshi and Wong Kar Wai were not well known in the US at all. All the little fan boys (myself included) were still stuck on John Woo. My friend handed me a bootleg of ""Fallen Angels"" along with a copy of Beat Takeshi's ""Violent Cop"". I went home and put them in and thought, ""what the hell am I watching!!!?!?? ""Fallen Angels"" had to be the weirdest, most unorthodox, most elliptical piece of film I'd ever looked at. EVERY SHOT looked weird and wrong. It seemed the director looked at every rule in the Hollywood filmmaker's guide and did the exact opposite! Also, it looked like the whole thing was shot with a security camera. Everything was fish-eyed. Too strange. But something about it made me keep watching. It actually took me a couple of tries to get all the way through it. It was just so odd, and hallucinatory.Then finally, I was able to get through the entire thing in one sitting, and that's when the magic happened. You MUST watch this film all the way through till the end in one sitting in order to ""get it"". The very end of the film is when the illuminating flash happens and when the film suddenly makes sense. If you do, I promise you, it will be a magical, sad and sweet, and extremely rewarding experience. This film by miles transcends the gangster genre. It is so many things at once. More than anything, in fact, it is a love story. But a love story in the same way (odd as it may sound) that ""Last Picture Show"" is a love story. It's about being madly in love with someone who will never be able to love you back.I actually liken this film to some of Sam Shepard's absurdist theater pieces from the 60s and 70s. Where for much of the duration you don't quite understand what you're looking at, although it seems the director MUST have some sort of plan, and then, at the end, all of the strands come together and it makes total sense.",Fallen Angels

This was very similar to Chungking Express, however I liked this one just a little bit more. I don't really know why, maybe because there was more action in this one? But nonetheless, this was a pretty enjoyable crime/drama/romance. There is just one problem that I also had with Chungking Express: What the hell is the point? So many of the things that happened have absolutely nothing to do with the plot. Or maybe they do and I just don't see it. There are a lot of unnecessary sequences in this and Chungking Express that leave me a little confused. I'm ngl, I was expecting to give this a higher score, since this gets a LOT of praise. I also kinda got the main male characters confused throughout the film. I'll need to rewatch this someday, but for now, this is definitely one you need to check out for yourselves so you can form your own opinion on it.",Fallen Angels
25,evileyereviews,A Supercharged Feast for the Eyes,8,14 November 2010,"Strapping neon lights in the dark underbelly of Hong Kong sets the stage for this uber-hip tale of isolationist tragedy of love-shorn, fallen heroes as they try to make their way amongst the cold heartless throngs of civilization. Where connections of life are hostile, our players literally create from scratch a method to link a distant humanity to their otherwise meaningless lives. The result is pure visual bliss. To not be pleasurably mesmerized by this flick is a treason best left without a conviction. The story is a haphazard scramble of lost souls loosely linked by a cinematic art form best left undefined. The direction is just as indescribably perfect, like putting into words the puissance of Mona Lisa's hinting smile. The camera man must have enjoyed a cocktail of methamphetamines washed down with steroids, the result being a wonderfully frenzied complex of voyeuristic energies and incongruous situations whose symbolic import are indelibly brought together in this flick's perfect ending. The only problem was that, as in all of life, the good times all must come to a painful end, a lustful need for more conjugated to an emptiness that life verite' seems unwilling to fulfill.

26,Davidon80,"Like a breath of fresh air in a stagnant room full of sick, world weary patients.",7,29 March 2006,"It is rare for movies to elicit a feeling, that I can only describe as, cinematic cathartic release. As though the movie is a living breathing element that has some how reached into the very heart of the viewer and pressed a cinematic button or released a cinematic lever that has laid dormant for so long. Very few movie over the years possess this ability, but Fallen Angels (along with Wong Kai Wai's Chung King Express) has successfully achieved this.Many people have panned Fallen Angels as being a confused, incoherent, meandering mess of overly stylised visuals and sound. Although this can be granted (though we shouldn't really listen to such comments), I feel that it is the wrong way to approach this movie. Fallen Angels doesn't merely use hyper kinetic camera movements and vivid imagery to create an avant garde narrative. I feel that there is something more important being said in this movie. If you look closely enough you will notice that there is something in Fallen Angels that is telling the viewer about the power of cinema and the power of images.There is something in the spontaneity of the direction, the merging of story lines, the fast paced editing, the changes in camera angles, the eclectic soundtrack, the varying perspectives, the merging of genres. What I feel is being said, is that cinema is designed to invigorate the soul. Cinema awakens feelings that has been left numb by a sterile waking life. The writer Brecht said, 'art is not a mirror to be held up to reality, but a hammer in which to shape it'. It is with this thought in mind that I approach Wong Kai Wai Fallen Angels. Unlike the works of Brecht, Fallen Angels isn't a movie that is overtly political or making a political statement of any kind. But, like Brecht's work, it is a remedy to the state of inaction that many people feel is conducive of there everyday lives. It is a cry for attention in order to remind the viewer that despite the inherent vulgarity of the world around us, if we look at the world with the right eyes we can see a glimpse or even just a flicker of beauty, which by itself can change the course of our lives.Wong Kai Wai has put experimental cinema at the forefront and has woven a dark and brooding story about the absurd underbelly of life in pre-handover Hong Kong. It is a comic/tragedy, but all the whilst-like all great tragedies- there is a feeling that life's richer more undefinable elements will come through by the end.Overall, without losing myself in too much metaphysical fornication, Fallen Angels is a master class in cinematic flare.",Fallen Angels

To say ""the cinematographer's fueled by a combination of drugs"" is an understatement. Seeing a few of Wong Kar-Wai's other features I really had high hopes for this one, however at the end I found it disappointing as it doesn't capture the same charisma or structure of his other films, for example like As Tears Go By or Chungking Express. The biggest problem in my opinion is Michelle Reis' character as the set-up girl. She isn't given enough screen time to establish a decent bond with the audience, the charm surrounding her is flat. Karen Mok's character of Blondie is unfortunately average, she comes across as annoying rather than afflicted and thus fails to capture the audience's interest too. The women in this movie just don't tote the same amount of power as in other Kar-Wai films. The females are cold and don't intend to change, which goes against the male characters and flow of the movie. Again the cinematography feels overzealous and at some moments, even pretentious which I never thought I could say about Kar-Wai. Complaints aside, Takeshi Kaneshiro steals the show with his bizarre character, and I would actually watch the movie again just to see his portion. There's a lot of great themes here, and the sense of grittiness and isolation is done extremely well. Overall I didn't enjoy Fallen Angels, but I do understand the attraction. Other Wong Kar-Wai fans may love it. -6/10",Fallen Angels

What marks him out from other directors who are just flashy, is his ability to bring to this style something that has real depth, and a power to move.  This film is populated with the usual city dwellers who are essentially lonely and looking for connection with someone or something real and meaningful.

If you've seen one, you pretty much know if you'll like the other... though I'd recommend Chunking Express as the first of the 2 to see. It seems to me Fallen Angels is a bit more intense, so seeing it after CKE would turn the experience up, where seeing Fallen Angels first might make CKE seem a bit anticlimactic. I can't believe he shot on 35mm - the look is so gritty & saturated I thought it was shot on a variation of 16mm. This is NOT a criticism! The visual effect is a big part of the impact of this movie.

Then there's Michelle Reis, with fringes so long I can hardly see her face at all, no thanks to the shaky camera, which is very irritating.Just when some bits may get interesting like the guy massages the dead pig, the camera switch to a new scene and there's literally no story.It has a feeling that it's trying to be a cool movie but there's no story and character development and I don't care about all the people in it but I'm just waiting for the movie to end since I've already paid for this DVD.Rated 4/10 due to: one of my favorite song in the soundtrack- Forget Me Both Leon Lai and Michelle Reis are among my favorite stars. I was anxious to see them both together again after watching the TV series 'The Legendary Rangers'.But even with this 2 gorgeous actors, the film is wasted because it has not made full use of the enormous potential from the main title and only worth one viewing for the factors mentioned above. It could have been made like Leon The Professional but it's just a piece of crap. Rent it if you must, but not to buy at all. I regret buying the DVD.",Fallen Angels

38,Xiayu,Uneven but Deeply Affecting,8,31 January 2005,"We follow the lives of five isolated and desperately lonely people who will cling to anything that will make them Feel.One is a Hit-man (Leon Lai) who does his job in a messy but workmanlike fashion. He kills several people at once, then he switches off the light as he leaves and hops a bus to go home, just like those who work 9-5. On one of these bus rides, he is recognised by an old friend from school, whose 'normal life' reminds him of how much he hates his own. He wants to get out, but he doesn't know how to do anything else.Another is the Partner of the Hit-man (Michelle Reis), who sets up his jobs for him and cleans his flat when he's not there. They have never met but she develops an obsession with him that includes taking his garbage home and rifling through it, going to his favourite bar and sitting in his favourite seat, and masturbating on his bed, because it makes her feel close to him. He is aware of what she's doing, but doesn't know how to handle it. He arranges to met her but can't bring himself to show up.A third character is a Man-Child (Takeshi Kaneshiro) who lost his voice eating a can of rotten pineapple. He roams the streets at night, breaking into shops and imagining he is working there. He also forces goods and services on people, who as often as not give him money just to get rid of him. He lives with his father in a small and stuffy apartment in a large and run-down building that also houses Michelle Reis's character. They know each other by sight, but they never speak.The fourth main character is a Girl (Charlie Young) who finds out over the phone that the man she loves is marrying someone else. In her rage and brokenness, she latches on to the Man-Child, who then fancies himself in love with her. She is all he has. But just as quickly as she appears, she leaves. Later he sees her on the street, cleaned-up and apparently leading a better life. He tries to get her attention but she ignores him. She doesn't want to be reminded.The fifth character (Karen Mok) is a bleached blonde who is close to having a nervous breakdown. In an otherwise empty McDonalds, she insinuates herself on the Hit-man, who it turns out was once her lover. He doesn't recognise her, which seems to be the story of her life. He tells her straight out that he doesn't want anything other than a companion for the night, and in the absence of anything better, she agrees. She imagines she will woo him into changing his mind and staying with her.This film left me with an internal atmosphere I couldn't shake for days. It's claustrophobic, meandering, chaotic and at times very indulgent, but overall it's a sad, moving study of loss and emptiness, and people's inability to connect with others.",Fallen Angels

40,adrian_stranik,The Daddy of the Kar Wai Canon,8,20 October 2006,"Fallen Angels could have been so named due to its dropped origin as part of director Wong Kar Wai's previous film Chunking Express, emerging afterwards as a follow up. To hear the critics tell it, 'Express' is his masterpiece, regularly making the 'best movies ever made' lists along side such exalted company as your Citizens Kane's and Casablanca's. But for me Fallen Angels is, to date, the daddy of the Wong Kar Wai canon.Fallen Angel tells of a not quite burnt-out hit man, Leon, who begins to tire of the whole 'gun for hire' malarkey and decides to quit on account of his burgeoning feelings for the female operative who he has never met, but who plans his jobs for him. The female operative, Michelle, also emotes for our existential assassin but somehow they both realise that if they ever did come face to face the fantasy would evaporate. The unrequited love thing is Kar Wai's forte but here it is more a case of ""As long as you don't look at it, it won't disappear."" So their love continues on the basis of ensuring that it never really exists. Anxious to avoid an inevitable unprofessional encounter, our navel gazing killer goes off on an adventure into the Kowloon night where he crosses paths with a series of likable reprobates before embarking on that fatal ""one last job."" This takes us not so neatly into a 'mad as a hatter' subplot about a petty criminal who was rendered mute as a boy by a can of 'out of date' pineapples. He goes out at night and gets up to a range of activities such as massaging a dead pig and kidnapping a family and forcing them to eat ice cream. He to falls in love, with a girl who believes she has been beaten to the altar by someone called Blondie. He helps her go in search of the usurper of her affections resulting in a hilarious beating up of a blow up doll! Cinematographer and Kar Wai regular Christopher Doyle engages a warped and gaudy neon look throughout; something of a trade mark in Kar Wai films. This is the world from inside a Wurlitzer juke box  or, at least, through the eyes of a tranquilised goldfish and this, incidentally, is not a complaint. The other thing I like about this film is that it walks the line between the art house 'heart warmers' of the best of European cinema and the 'Glock Opera' pyrotechnics of John Woo and Ringo Lam.

This film is merely a rehash of its predecessor that failed to live up to my expectations.  Sure, it has its funny moments and quirky characters, but I guess Faye Wong's cute and lovable character from ""Chungking Express"" was just too hard to top.The quirkiness of the characters in this film, especially the part of He Zhiwu (played by Takeshi Kaneshiro) seemed forced here and too way over-the-top to be believable.If you're going to take your chances on this film, have yourself a half-gallon tub of your favorite ice cream and watch for that ice-cream scene.Rating: 4 out of 10",Fallen Angels

48,mllora3,Everything you have seen before and nothing like anything you have seen before.,10,26 December 2005,"One thing is for sure - it is everything you have seen before and nothing like anything you have seen before. As a Wong Kar-wai junkie, I have to admit - it is getting harder and harder to find a favorite - Fallen Angels is among the top three. In one sense I really loved Fallen Angels because it is full of the same urban angst brought up in Chungking Express. There is something utterly and strikingly gorgeous about Wong Kar-Wai's movies. The mise-en-scene and backdrops his characters inhabit in that give each scene a particular almost brooding feeling. Wong Kar-Wai's are lost and lonely in a world that is dark and full of despair. Fallen Angels is no different.Fallen Angels' Hong Kong is alive in the evenings. One could argue that the cinematography captures a dreamlike state, pure urban neon, and erotic. In Fallen Angels we travel the gritty back alleys (reminiscent of Chunking Express) into underworld dives, dreary dive bars juxtaposed against a brightly-lit McDonalds. I have to say this... Wong Kar-wai does somewhat put me off with his product placement - but we have to finance our projects somehow, I guess.Leon Lai's is a lazy hired killer. His portrayal, it can be argues is weighty and conjures up a sense of gaudy (almost caddy) persona. I am reminded of Yuddy in Days of Being Wild. Lai is wonderful as a contradiction of apathy and poetry. Lai plays it with a languid air. Every move is deliberate - smooth. Conversely, Michelle Reis' is his doppelganger - his manager. She is obsessed with him, becomes emotionally attached to him. I would argue that a sense of betrayal set the stage for the hit man's final demise. A nighttime ride in the back of a motorcycle with He Zhiwu (Takeshi Kaneshiro) leads me wonder is she has comes undone. Love though, and its many forms of cruelty is a recurring theme with Wong Kar-wai. Oh that sweet betrayal... He Zhiwu is a potent character. The relationship He Zhiwu develops with his father is proof positive that even in the broken world of dysfunctionality there resides a lotus from the marshes. The videotape sessions, at first almost humorous, forms yet another center of love shattered - sometimes we need to really treasure what we have lest it slip by so suddenly... he Zhiwu is a symbol of the lyricism of youth.One has to admit, even after Chunking Express, Fallen Angels is different from any Hong Kong movie. Driven by inner monologue (much like the later much acclaimed The Follow from The Hire series) it draws one in. The languid tone and deeply erotic tale is one that will stand the test of time. Fallen Angels according to Teo takes over from where Chungking Express leaves of. I argue that it brought Chungking Express to a whole new realm. Fallen Angels is Chungking Express on steroids.Miguel Llora",Fallen Angels

This movie is both funny, and sad. It made me very sad and reevaluate my life, and the things that I have that I take for granted. I guess that's kind of an intellectual thing to say. But that's it. On to more superficial reasons why I like Fallen Angels. The people where cool clothes. The entire film was shot in a wide angel lens. There are multiple spontaneous fight scenes. One of the Characters name is Blondie. The lighting is not very realistic in some parts, especial in the kitchen with the mute boy because there is a lot of green light seeming to not come from anywhere in particular, but anyway..... even though the lighting is not very realistic it's COOLER that way.

53,clark-carpenter,Night in the City,10,12 October 2006,"Wong Kar-Wai is the modern cinema's premier poet of loss and longing. His characteristically enigmatic films capture the erratic rhythms and ephemeral nature of memory and torment: fleeting, fragmented, wandering only to return obsessively to its central foci.While Wong's debut, ""As Tears Go By"", was a relatively straightforward commercial riff on Scorsese's ""Mean Streets"" and the 'heroic bloodshed' style of Hong Kong street opera pioneered by action maestro John Woo, he would establish with ""Days of Being Wild"" and ""Chungking Express"" a signature style characterized by visual bravura mixed with interwoven and intensely introspective tales of emotionally isolated young people adrift in the shadow kingdom of urban postmodernity. Eschewing more traditional narrative formats for an elliptical self-referentiality that mirrors memory itself, Wong's films are rarely instantly accessible, but reward the patient viewer with intoxicating moods and contemplative brilliance.""Fallen Angels"" was originally conceived as something of a 'nightside' sequel/companion piece to ""Chungking Express."" Structurally and thematically it mirrors the latter with two separate plot lines, each centering on a pair of twentysomethings (a hit-man and his female 'agent' in one and a strange, mute confidence man and the girl he takes a shine to in the other) in search of love but unable or unwilling to find it in each other. Assorted camera tricks, fish eye lenses, slow motion sequences and the strategic use of a gloriously bittersweet pop soundtrack all help to capture a mood of frantic desperation and the distortions of memory and longing.Wong also invokes the first of his 'art' films, ""Days of Being Wild,"" returning to its concern with the loss and meaning of identity in an impersonal world. Leon Lai's hit-man and Takeshi Kaneshiro's petty criminal both try - and fail - to remake their lives on this straight and narrow. One of them manages a peace of sorts with his failure - the other goes out out in a bittersweet blaze of glory. Wong also explores the way in which longing (mis)identifies others: his characters view each other through the distorted lens memory and desire - what they see is not reality, but a projection of their own dreams - and when the truth is made manifest, it is always the cruelest blow.",Fallen Angels

58,slon-3,Kar-wai Wong is a genius,10,11 November 1999,"Kar-wai Wong is lately the only reason why I think that movies are art. This is the only videotape that I ever bought. I watched it so many times and every time the effect gets stronger. One thing so special about this film is the range of emotions and its abrupt changes in the mood. By the way, I actually saw two different versions, one in Cantonese and one dubbed in Mandarin (I don't speak either but I think I'm right). The Mandarin version has a somewhat different ending: the song at the end is different (same as the the one from the first part of  Chungking Express), which makes the whole ending somewhat less sentimental. Can't decide which ending I like better.",Fallen Angels
59,emilita,MY FAVORITE MOVIE,10,30 August 2003,"This movie is fantastic.  The cinematography is captivating, the characters are painfully human, you laugh, you cry...just watch it--that's all I need to say, it's that good. Chungking Express is just the beginning of the story...",Fallen Angels
60,chanapai,One of the masterpiece from Wong kar-wai,10,4 November 2020,"A lonely movie with a lonely people. When I watched this movie I feel ""loneliness"" ""isolate"" but at the same time I feel warm. Despite living in the big city like Hong Kong you can still find lonely people all around. Apart from that you can learn a lot from this movie such as ""Thing's always changing"" ""Change yourself"" ""we must take our own decision whether it's right or wrong"". Not only the story and messages that was good but also the technique and soundtrack that was very amazing.
The movie was so unique, you can't find this style of movie from another director.",Fallen Angels
61,KHSargenius,"From Where Did They Fall, These Angels?",10,21 December 1999,"I've only been to Hong Kong once. But from what I could see it must be a bit of a strange place to live.And judging by most of Wong Kar-Wai's movies I'm not the only one to think so.Normal cinematic convention has it that we get know the characters through their needs and desires. And there's no doubt that every single person in this kaleidoscopic merry-go-round is searching for something. But exactly what that is, is left for each and everyone of us to figure out ourselves. Densely layered the movie speak of alienation, loss and search of identity, and coping with not finding yourself in the position where you'd like to be. We meet most of the people in sort of a middle space - they're trying to leave their old places and selves but hesitating to move forward - not knowing where to go.As far as story telling goes this is some of the most purely visual stuff I've ever seen. Chris Doyle's cinematography is mind blowing. The visual's are the first and foremost - dialogue and the excellent VO's serve like tinted glasses, giving colour and mood to what we see, slightly altering our vision but always allowing the visuals to be the leader.",Fallen Angels
62,josh timmermann,Romantically Detached,10,12 July 2002,"Wong Kar-wai's Fallen Angels dives headfirst into the cultural alienation and milennial dread of modern-day Hong Kong. The film has a distinctly detached feeling about it that is certainly close to what its characters must feel. Some scenes are hypnotic and dreamlike, while others seem brutally real. The film's characters always seem to be wandering, or, perhaps, simply going through the motions of life. The voice-overs - which Wong uses as effectively as any director since the heyday of Terrence Malick - effectively add an extra dimension to the characters. The ending of Fallen Angels is one of the most beautiful, poetic, and true ever filmed.While this film's predecessor, Wong's Chungking Express is a wonderful, exceptional movie, Fallen Angels is ultimately superior - a masterpiece that Wong only surpassed with his last film, the astonishing In the Mood for Love. Still, while In the Mood for Love may be Wong's best film to date, Fallen Angels remains (as it probably always will) the quintessential Wong Kar-wai picture in that it perfectly embodies the bold, Godardian, recklessness that the name Wong Kar-wai immediately brings to mind. 10/10",Fallen Angels
63,qsft9,caleidoscopic and near hallucination,10,12 July 2002,"Almost manga-like in camera style and story telling (I mean manga as in Akira and Ghost in The Shell). Very colorfull yet dark, explicit yet tender, soft and violent. Your sucked in by the nostrils, visually shaken about and taken for a very exciting trip into hyper-subreality.  The daylight at the end has the same effect as the dishcleaning and lights on after a very good party. Very sobering. The movie leaves you with the feeling of having had a vigorous massage and wanting more. More Wong Kar-Wai.",Fallen Angels
64,riverNefertiti,"Magical, stylish and unpredictable!",10,13 March 2005,"'Fallen Angels' is one of the most exciting movies I've seen in a long time; interesting camera work (not what's everyone used to), fantastic script, impressive acting, funny, erotic with style. I am not sure what I was expecting from this film but the great mixture or genres sure did make me laugh and cry at the same time. Simply amazing! This is not a gangster film; it is a story about individualism and loneliness, very emotional. This is one of those films where none of the actors needs to say 'I love you' or 'I miss you' to let everyone know what they feel. The looks, the music and the moves even the camera work tells everything. You simply feel what they feel. I absolutely loved the soundtrack; powerful and sentimental This movie is purely the work of genius, don't miss it!",Fallen Angels
65,ddeluca,Gorgeous and interesting,10,30 November 1998,"This is definitely one of the most beautiful movies I've ever seen.  The director goes way over the top visually, but pulls it off.  There's all sorts of very modern, very MTV techniques - lots of intense close-ups, lots of fast editing, all sorts of hand-held, shaky shots, all sorts of dim, grainy shots.  If it sounds visually chaotic, well, it is, but it's all done so artistically that it's almost magnificent.Plot-wise, don't expect too much.  I'm still not sure how one character was related to the two other main characters.  But narrative doesn't drive this movie - image and emotion does.  The first comparison that comes to mind is Apocalypse Now, but with a much more modern, indie, and artsy quality to it, perhaps a bit like the french film Diva.Oh, and did I mention that it has great music, too - some very sexy, some very foreboding, much of it very prominent.Very entertaining, and even though the narrative is confusing, you come to really feel for the characters as well.",Fallen Angels
66,fatwok,boring and pretentious,1,2 October 2009,"OK, I like ChungKing Express a lot. I get this movie. I understand what he was trying to do and say, but I don't like it one bit. It's boring, pretentious, and predictable once you've seen enough of the pop films from Hong Kong. He tried too hard to be stylish and original, but unlike Chung King Express, it didn't work. On top of this, just from looking at the film, it looks as if he was high on drugs the whole time he was working on this movie. It might have been cool back in the heydays of drug culture but looking at it again today it just plain silly. The acting was awful and predictable, which is typical of most movies coming out of Hong Kong. The whole thing looked like a collage of clips copies from other films. I rank this as one of the worst movies I've ever seen. What a waste of film.",Fallen Angels
67,blobtick,flash,10,16 November 2003,"this movie is a really entertaining and stylish mixture between ""smoke2, gibsonesque sci-fi hong kong feeling, and a bit of ""the killer"".the film consists of different episodes, which in the end intermingle with each other. this movie really has a great story about love, crime, urban lowlife, and is supported by its fabulous soundtrack. it's really worth seeing.",Fallen Angels
68,marking50,Another of WKW's beautiful masterpiece,9,8 January 2006,"WKW strikes back again with this wonderful - and different movie. The Hong Kong director brings us a unique story about loneliness. As other movies of WKW, this movies represents a wonderful visual experience. Great directing for 3 stories: The story of an assassin, lonely and living day to day deciding weather it's really worth continuing with his profession or not; the story of his partner, a beautiful woman who relies her loneliness on her obsession with her partner; and the story of a mute guy that works at night in all the closed stores and markets, and with the different encounters with a woman and his relation with his father. All three stories are stories of loneliness, of love affairs impossible to fulfill and of the wish of each one to find a meaning to their existence. Like in all movies of WKW, all characters are solitary. This movie is another one of the directors masterpieces, trying to describe all the lonely souls in Hong Kong and the impossibility of finding a meaning to their life, their professions and a meaning to love. A bizarre and great soundtrack, such as the great photography and stylish directing makes this movie a must-see in the Chinese's director.",Fallen Angels
69,Eirik-5,One of my favorites.,10,18 December 1998,"Absolutely brilliant. When I first saw Chung King Express, it quickly became one of my favorite movies.  It still is, but Fallen Angels is even better. It encompasses so much.  There is such a potent mix of action, drama, humor, love, music etc. that it overwhelmed me and left me in a state not unlike post-orgasmic ecstasy.  Since I've seen it four times now and the effect hasn't been diminished one iota, I'm convinced that this one oughta go down in the record books.  My extreme gratitude to Wong Kar Wai for creating this masterpiece.",Fallen Angels
70,MyNameIsMarvinNash,Fun little foreign flick,8,10 October 2020,"Fallen Angels is not quite the ride that Chungking Express (same director) gave us the year earlier. This is something different. Yes, it's more of the same in a few ways: it is fun and light-hearted and the tone is similar at times. But this film is not as serious as the other one. My advice: don't take it too seriously. Don't read into it. It's a fun ride that doesn't always make a lot of sense, but it doesn't have to. If every movie tried to make sense all the time they'd all be the same. Fallen Angels gives us a break from all that. It's full of fast-paced vignettes, one after the next, and a great cast of colorful and quirky characters. And of course, as with any Christopher Doyle-shot film, the cinematography is brilliant!",Fallen Angels
71,tiagodna,I'm a Kar-Wai Wong fan but...,2,30 December 2014,"Let me start by stating that I'm a true Kar-Wai Wong fan. I've seen ""In the mood for love"", ""Chungking Express"" and ""My Blueberry nights"". I know his films are different and are not made for the ""mainstream consumers"", they must be analyzed differently.I was looking forward to watching this movie because I do love his art and so far I had never been let down.This movie definitely has some of the typical Kar-Wai's trademarks (e.g the deep and awesome soundtrack, the slow motions, the amazing colors, the cruel portrait of Hong Kong, the intriguing characters). But it stops there.The movie is boring, tiresome and the plot is very weak.If you're a fan I would recommend skipping this one and trying another one of Wong's masterpieces.",Fallen Angels
72,zsutton42,"Haunting, atmospheric, brilliance.",10,27 June 2014,"This film is so good. When I say that, I do not mean it has a gripping riveting story, not that the story is boring or sub-par. In truth, it has an interesting story with amusing characters, but that is not what makes this a fantastic film. What makes it fantastic is its vivid and dreamlike atmosphere. I can't decide if it is better than Chungking Express. While Chungking Express had slightly more interesting stories, Fallen Angels has such a rich night atmosphere. Watching this film is like entering another world. Some shots are so spectacular that they will be burned into my brain forever.Nuff' said.",Fallen Angels
73,MetroStyles,Not one of KWW's best,6,4 June 2011,"Fallen Angels feels like an art house film made by a young director trying to find his voice. The fact that it was made by the same established director that had in the previous few years released Days of Being Wild and Chungking Express made it all the more surprising, and frankly, disappointing.But don't be misled - this film has KWW's signature all over it. While the nostalgic aspect of some of his historical flicks is completely absent, the sense of unrequited love, alienation, and tragic inefficacy of human communication are central themes. Doyle's cinematography is creative as always and for the most part it contributes, rather than distracts. The music is quite good.The main problem with Fallen Angels is that it is awfully difficult to feel a connection for the characters. The plot does not move forward with much intention and the disjointed mini vignettes were a detriment to getting the audience emotionally involved. The characters are very difficult to relate to: The partner is a character that is drawn too sketchily and is not given enough dialog for the viewer to relate to deeply. The mute is meant to win us over with his innocent charm, but it is at times an overacted role which makes the character somewhat annoying. Blondie adds some comic relief (though also in an overacted manner) but is a bit easier to relate to and feel sorry for. Lastly, the killer is very apathetic about his life which does not endear the viewer to him. He is more ""cool"" than likable. Though that his inability to make decisions ultimately does not serve him well in life is a message that may resonate strongly with some viewers. There are moments of tenderness between characters, though few and far in between. This was undoubtedly KWW's intention as a mechanism for underscoring the loneliness of urban life. I can't help but think his point would have been better made with more realistic, normal characters as he has done so effectively in his other films. Overall definitely worth a viewing for all KWW fans, though this is certainly not where I would start if I were just discovering the director.For reference, this is how I rate some of this other films:Chungking Express: 9/10 (the second half 10/10) ||| 2046: 9/10 ||| Days of Being Wild: 9/10 ||| In the Mood for Love: 8.5/10 ||| Happy Together: 8.5/10 ||| Fallen Angels: 6/10",Fallen Angels
