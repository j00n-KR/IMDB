0,MartinHafer,"Die-hard Sandler fans will no doubt love it, though I was less than amused.",3,1 August 2009,"There seems to be a very strong base for Adam Sandler--people who absolutely adore everything he makes. No matter the quality, his films always do well at the box office. Now I used to be convinced that Sandler was vastly overrated, but in the last couple years, I've gone back and seen most of his films. I was surprised to find that I either disliked them strongly (LITTLE NICKY is probably the worst of these) but also loved some of his films--particularly his romantic comedies, such as THE WEDDING SINGER. However, there seemed to be few of his films about which I felt indifferently. I think what I particularly disliked were his films that tried too hard and were too loud (aside from THE WATERBOY)--his quieter and more thoughtful films really have impressed me.Unfortunately, YOU DON'T MESS WITH THE ZOHAN isn't a particularly deep film but more like the rapid-fire style that I don't care for very much. The jokes come very fast and most of them fall pretty flat. It's a shame, as I liked the film when it first began--watching Zohan on his anti-terrorism mission was pretty funny and visually stunning. However, after a short time, the film just got dumber and dumber--with countless jokes about Zohan's sexual prowess, the size of his member, his pubic hair, how he likes to have sex with old ladies, etc.. It all seemed very tiresome and intended to make the least demanding members of the audience happy--mostly teenagers who find this sort of stuff funny. It wasn't so much that the butts and sexual reference offended me, but that they just were cheap jokes that got very old very fast.It's a shame really, as SOME parts of the film were very good and could have made a very good film. The idea of an Israeli secret agent who like a combination of James Bond and Paul Mitchell is pretty funny. And, some of the humor was reminiscent of the wonderful short, WEST BANK STORY. But, with so many flat jokes, cameos by Sandler's friends (most of which didn't seem integrated into the film and tended to actually disrupt the film) and crude references, the film just isn't one I'd recommend. Instead, trying seeing REIGN ON ME, THE WEDDING SINGER, 50 FIRST DATES or THE WATERBOY--all exceptionally good films.",You Don't Mess with the Zohan
1,TheLittleSongbird,And I thought Little Nicky was bad...,1,3 April 2011,"Although I am not a big fan of Adam Sandler, he has given some good performances in some good movies such as Spanglish and The Wedding Singer. But I cannot say that for the dreck that is You Don't Mess with the Zohan. Before I saw this, I thought Little Nicky was his worst, after seeing this I have changed my mind.Sandler himself is at his least likable here, and his acting is painful to watch. It certainly doesn't help that his character here is incredibly irritating and gimmicky and verges on stereotypical either though. The cast that support him are talented but are given little to do. I was especially infuriated at the unforgivable waste of John Turturro.Production-values-wise, You Don't Mess with the Zohan looks rather cheap. The sets and scenery are okay if somewhat studio-bound-looking, but the cinematography and editing are rushed and could have been much tighter. The soundtrack is on the dull side, and some of it even doesn't fit with the tone of the film, of which it is quite manic.The story is predictable to the point you could actually tell what was happening next, which further spoiled my enjoyment of it. And did I mention the characters? I disliked every single one of them, they were little more than bland stereotypes and offensive ones at that. But what hurt You Don't Mess with the Zohan most other than Sandler's performance and the sloppy direction was the humour, which was constantly unfunny, silly and crude.So overall, an awful film and not recommended at all. 1/10 Bethany Cox",You Don't Mess with the Zohan
2,bkoganbing,Zohan Wants Money And Action,5,3 July 2008,"Just the prospect of seeing Adam Sandler as a superhero who's tired of the grind and wants to be a hairdresser is a funny prospect right there. My guess is that Sandler must have been influenced by seeing Warren Beatty in Shampoo when it played on Israeli TV. Warren was sure getting a lot of action in a profession supposedly the exclusive property of gay men.You Don't Mess With The Zohan finds Adam Sandler in the title role of an Israeli counterterrorist and a legend in the profession. But he's tired and fakes his own death in order to move to the USA and become a hair stylist. His Palestinian counterpart is John Turturro who capitalizes on the death announcement and goes into big business himself.The comedy which is an average one does contain a big kernel of truth that the Arabs and Israelis have more in common than they think. Both Arab and Israeli merchants in an area that looks more like the Atlantic Avenue than lower Manhattan are facing problems with a new landlord who wants them all out so he can build a big supermall. Michael Buffer in that part has all the heart and soul of Robert Moses. They may be into killing in the old country, but in America they're into making money. It's an uneasy alliance, but Sandler makes it work and he even gives up chasing women for one special female, a Palestinian named Raffaela who runs a Beauty Shop and played by Emmanuella Chiriqui. She's quite the beauty.You have to like Lainie Kazan as the horny matron who keeps coming back for more Zohan and Alec Mapp who's a more traditional hair stylist than Zohan. They're the best in the supporting cast.Adam Sandler fans should like this comedy although it is too long and could have been cut by a half hour. I was amused and I'm not really a fan of his.",You Don't Mess with the Zohan
3,SnoopyStyle,I didn't laugh once,5,11 January 2014,"Zohan (Adam Sandler) is a superhuman Israeli Special Forces. On a mission to catch the Arab terrorist Phantom (John Turturro), Zohan decides to fake his own death and start a new life as a New York hairdresser.I get what Adam Sandler is trying to do by making a broad comedy about the Middle East conflict. I'm not saying it's impossible to make a comedy about the Israeli-Arab conflict. I'm just saying it's very very hard.Adam Sandler is trying everything. I admire his effort, and his energy. It's insane enough, but I don't really get the satire. I look at this movie like the African American salon people looking at Zohan as he jumps on the weave like a bomb. It's odd, it's interesting, but just not funny. The closest to funny is whenever Zohan sexes up the old ladies. That's kind of cute.",You Don't Mess with the Zohan
4,Prismark10,Hair raising,6,1 January 2014,"Sandler plays a superhuman commando called Zohan who is the finest and most respected soldier for the Israeli Defense Force but secretly dreams of a life as a hairdresser.Zohan fakes his death and moves to the USA and into an ethnic neighbourhood in NYC where Arabs and Jews mingle and gets a job in a Palestinian hair salon where he quickly becomes a top hairdresser whilst trying to keep his identity a secret.At the same time, a corporate magnate played by Michael 'let's get ready to rumble' Buffer plans to turn the area into a mega shopping mall by hiring rednecks to stir up trouble.Obviously a slapstick comedy about the Israel and Palestine situation is going to enter choppy waters.In the UK the BBC once made a sitcom about the Troubles in Northern Ireland and decided to look at it from a Jewish perspective to get around the sectarian controversy.So how would Sandler and his writers (who are Jewish) deal with it?Well they take the the absurdist screwball route and focus more on the cultural angles of the Israeli and Palestinians which is likely to be more funnier if you hail from that region of the Middle East.It is obvious the filmmakers realised that they would be better off being even handed probably due to the fact that Sandler films have a good following with Muslims around the world.This is a corny and sporadically funny although there is too much stereotyping. Of course the rival communities find a target that unites both factions. The American redneck!",You Don't Mess with the Zohan
5,kosmasp,Sandler-ism,4,1 May 2014,"Adam Sandler is able to act, he has proved that in ""Spanglish"" and ""Punch Drunk Love"". But he also likes to do those really light comedies. Then again, people love seeing him in those, so those get produced rather than a drama or a movie where he has to act. While I think he has done better movies/comedies too, there have been much worse too.Zohan has the same predictable jokes and could be seen as racially on the verge/edge of not walking the line but crossing it. But if you watch Sandler movies you should be used to jokes that are not politically correct. And a movie about a ""terrorist"" (not really) hair guy should be telling you were this is going. Adam Sandler has charisma and if you are into this, you'll love this, but if you don't laugh in the first 5 to 10 minutes, chances are you won't the rest of the running time either ...",You Don't Mess with the Zohan
6,Sleepin_Dragon,"If you need cheering up, this shocking film will make you chuckle.",7,23 January 2021,"Why do I listen to what's top 3 on Netflix!!! There's always an Adam Sandler film in the top ten. For good reason I suppose, he's very likeable, and produces a certain kind of film.I was in the mood for watching a film, which didn't need me to think or use my brain in any way, shape or form, this did the job, I laughed at the sheer nonsense.Under normal circumstances, I probably wouldn't watch it, but after a tough day, it made me laugh, and made me switch off.It's awful, and I will never be able to unsee Sandler's butt, but I chuckled the whole way through it. 7/10.",You Don't Mess with the Zohan
7,gavin6942,I Think I Might Have Liked It,6,5 August 2008,"Zohan (Adam Sandler), Israel spy, fakes his own death in order to come to America and start a new profession: hair stylist. But problems begin to mount when he is recognized by a local Arab cab driver (Rob Schneider), who alerts a Palestinian terrorist (John Turturro). This, and he falls in love with a Palestinian woman.For reasons that I cannot begin to comprehend, the reviews I read on this were largely positive, including from political commentator Stuart Klawans, who is very picky most of the time. Which is not to say the film is bad, but I have a hard time thinking that the movie is all that good. Most of the jokes revolve around the use of hummus or Sandler's sexual prowess with older women.I was amused, at least somewhat, despite my general dislike of Sandler. (I like some of his movies but overall don't consider him a great comedian.) I think this is due to Schneider (love him) and Turturro (vastly under-rated). I needed some Jon Lovitz, but this was still a good ensemble cast. What I found most troublesome was the portrayal of Israelis and Palestinians.On one hand, they did a decent job of making the conflict humorous, which I imagine is hard to do. But it seems irresponsible to take such a big and important issue and reduce it to such a stereotype, and with such a subtle bias. While the gist seems to be that Palestinians and Israelis need to learn to live together in harmony, there's still an underlying theme of ""Israel good"" and ""Palestinians are all terrorists"". So, this isn't a story of two equals coming together, but of one side being assimilated by the other to some extent.I'd like to give the movie another chance. I freely admit I watched this after a night out, so my body was largely composed of Miller Lite. I followed it fine, but probably missed much (one of the people I watched it with seems to barely recollect it at all). Hopefully giving this film another chance doesn't lead to a reassessment of Sandler, and maybe I can try to view it without over-analyzing... but it's hard to make a film about Middle East conflict and not invite criticism.",You Don't Mess with the Zohan
8,jboothmillard,You Don't Mess with the Zohan,4,3 April 2011,"From director Dennis Dugan (Big Daddy, I Now Pronounce You Chuck & Larry, Grown Ups), I had seen the poster and DVD cover many times, and I might have seen a clip or two, so I gave it a chance. Basically Israeli superhuman Special Agent Zohan 'The Zohan' Dvir (Adam Sandler) is skilled and respected, but he wants to make a new life for himself, so during a mission to apprehend the Phantom (John Turturro ), he fakes his death. Soon after doing so he sees his dream lifestyle on TV in the form of his new career choice, he heads for New York City to pursue his dream and try his hand as a hair stylist. He doesn't get anywhere for a while with his unorthodox methods for customer service and stuff, but then he offers to work for free doing any kind of odd job in the struggling salon owned by the beautiful Dalia (Emmanuelle Chriqui). After getting the job as cleaner, Zohan is doing everything he can to impress his new boss enough to get the job he really wants, and he does when hair-stylist Debbie (Shulie Cowen) quits. Over time he gains a great reputation not just as a great hair-stylist, but winning over elderly clientèle with his macho secret encounters in the closet or wherever. It is obvious though that Zohan may have his womanising ways satisfying the female customers, but he realises he has gained true feelings of love for Dalia. Before he can propose to her though there is a big dispute from Walbridge (Michael Buffer) who frequently increases rent for the salon, gets skinheads to terrorise the neighbourhood, causes arguments between the Jews, Muslims, Arabs, and Palestinians, and chucks the out to create a building with a roller coaster on top. Of course Zohan goes against these skinheads, and his past life as a Secret Agent comes back into action more than he expected, but don't worry, he saves the day in the end and gets together with Dalia. Also starring Nick Swardson as Michael, Lainie Kazan as Gail, Ido Mosseri as Oori, Rob Schneider as Salim, Chris Rock as Taxi Driver, Henry Winkler as Limousine Passenger, Kevin James as Hacky Sack Tournament Celebrity Judge, Mariah Carey, George Takei and Dom DeLuise. Sandler is reasonably funny with his dodgy accent and high kicks (literally), the supporting cast members and cameo stars do alright too, the action sequences with ridiculous Matrix style spoofing has its moments, it is silly most of the time and has the occasional gross or not very funny in the right way gag, but I guess you could see this comedy once. Okay!",You Don't Mess with the Zohan
9,Tweekums,Adam Sandler plays an elite anti-terrorist operative who dreams of being a hair stylist!,7,22 August 2016,Zohan is Israel's top counter-terrorist operative but he has had enough of conflict; he just wants to retire and become a hair stylist. To this end he fakes his own death and heads to New York. When he gets there he is turned down by every salon he approaches; eventually he gets a job sweeping up the hair in a small salon run by a Palestinian woman. Eventually she gives him a chance to cut hair and he satisfies all his female customers and not just due to his skills with the scissors! There are a couple of problems though; a Palestinian taxi driver recognises him and contacts Zohan's foe 'The Phantom' and the man who owns all the local shops is putting up rents to drive out his tenants; when that fails he tries to set the Jewish and Arab tenants against each other.This Adam Sandler vehicle has a good central idea and features plenty of genuinely funny moments it also has moments are just too silly or somewhat crude. Some people will find these excesses hilarious; others will find it ruins the film for them; I just thought it was a distraction from the better parts. Sandler was funny enough as Zohan and the supporting cast were solid enough. There is some action although it is played for silly laughs rather trying to be even vaguely believable. Overall I'd say this was funny enough but not a must see unless you are a die-hard Sandler fan.,You Don't Mess with the Zohan
10,paul_haakonsen,Very generic Adam Sandler movie...,5,15 December 2015,"Let's be frank here, Adam Sandler was a big name back in the day, but now what he is putting out there is very, very generic and seems to follow the exact same 'how-to-make-a-comedy' recipe every single time. If you have watched one Adam Sandler movie ten you have essentially seen them all. And yes, while he does what he is good at, it has been worn thin already and not all that thrilling to watch his movies anymore.There were some hilarious scenes throughout this movie because of the absurdity of the scenes and how over-the-top it all was. But if you enjoy a good laugh then there are far better movies available. Most of the comedy found in ""You Don't Mess With the Zohan"" is what I would refer to as semi-cheap comedy.The cast ensemble was good for a comedy of this type, that is at least a plus. John Turturro and Rob Schneider were actually quite good in this movie.""You Don't Mess With the Zohan"" is a movie for the fans of Adam Sandler, no doubt about it. For the rest of us it is a movie that you watch once and most likely never again.",You Don't Mess with the Zohan
11,Quinoa1984,the 'best' Sandler movie in about five years (which still means its only 'good'),7,10 June 2008,"When I was younger (i.e. back in the last decade), I was an unashamed Adam Sandler fan, as he was made for the kind of target audience (young teens) that I was in. Then, as time went on, his comedies got a little bit stale, with only one or two exceptions (the best, of course, being his role in Punch Drunk Love thanks to PT Anderson). As of late, sentiment, or just poor scripts, have gotten in the way of anything that's done it well for me, though I still hold him at the least as being a guilty pleasure. Now comes You Don't Mess with the Zohan, and I'm happy to report that it's overall very funny, probably his funniest since Anger Management (which was somewhat underrated at the time).It's got one of his oddest set-ups, and sometimes the plot kind of clicks along to a stupid tone (i.e. a mall trying to set up in an Israeli/Palestinian neighborhood), but there's a real charm to Sandler's character, behind all of the outrageous gags and running goofs (i.e. hummus, big-crotch thrusts, Mel Gibson). The set-up is simple enough: a bad-ass Moussad agent who can kill a person almost without trying, fakes his own death against a Palestinian kingpin (John Tuturro), and goes for his dream to become a professional hair-dresser in America. He gets that dream, as well as having sex with many, many older women who somehow get turned on like in Herbal Essences shampoo ads X100, but of course falls in love with the Palestinian girl who runs the shop he works at.There's some minor intrigue involving a cab-driver (Rob Schneider, not as crappy as usual) with a grudge against Zohan with a goat memory, and the eventual return of Tuturro's character (who, I might add, is absolutely uproariously funny in this, easily his funniest part since his days with the Coens) for a near final showdown. What makes most of the movie work though- co-scripted by Sandler and Robert Smigel for the first time in years, aided probably tremendously by Judd Apatow- is its dedication to the raunchy nature of the material, avoiding sentimentality in lieu for tasteless sex jokes (i.e. a certain hair-down-there is mentioned), and even some funny barbs at Israeli/Palestinian culture. It might not be the deepest satire, as many jokes revolve weirdly around Hackeysack, but it made me laugh, which is all I can really attest to.There are also, I should add, some pretty neat cameos and bit parts thrown in, like Shelly Berman from Curb Your Enthusiasm, Mariah Carey, the ""Let's Get Ready to Rumble"" guy in an actual small role, and amazingly Dave Matthews as a redneck-terrorist for hire.",You Don't Mess with the Zohan
12,ComedyFan2010,Hairstyles get old and so do jokes,6,15 June 2012,"With Adam Sandler I never know. Sometimes it is a movie that I find hilarious and sometimes it is total garbage.In this case after watching the beginning I thought it will be a hilarious one. I liked the idea, the setting, some cultural jokes (like for example with hummus). I liked how they managed to make the movie funny without it being offensive (not that I think nobody was offended, just talking about the reasonable ""offensive-limit""). Even though the main character is Israeli they still didn't make Palestinians look bad. I also like the main idea of Zohan going to States to make the dream of becoming a hair dresser come true.Unfortunatelyit all gets old after a while. They use the same jokes over and over again until it isn't funny anymore. And to be honest all the action towards the end just made me bored. This is not to say that there was nothing funny in the second half of the movie. It just went a bit down",You Don't Mess with the Zohan
13,edwagreen,Don't Mess With this Mishugana **1/2,5,4 January 2009,"This potentially hilarious film goes down rapidly in quality. The ironic thing here is that when the message of toleration between Arabs and Israelis is presented, the film comes apart.As the Israeli counter-terrorist expert, an Israeli superman, Adam Sandler, with an authentic Israeli accent, is hilarious. Accompanied by Hebrew rap music, we laugh at the various exploits that Sandler (Zohan) deals in.Coming to America to fulfill his life's ambition of becoming a hairdresser, Sandler falls for a Palestinian hairdresser and his working on elderly women at the salon is hilarious at best.There are small parts by Henry Winkler, Chris Rock and Charlotte Rae in this madcap comedy. Lainie Kazan plays her usual Jewish mother to the core.Some very not nice things are said here about landlords trying to get tenants out so that they can really improve their investments. Wickedness here is pitting Israeli against Arab.",You Don't Mess with the Zohan
14,dbborroughs,Amusing,7,15 June 2008,"Amusing Adam Sandler movie is a shift away from the serious films he's done of late back to the silliness of old. Actually not completely since the film is essentially a plea for everyone to get along. Zohan is an Israeli counter terrorist that is above all others. Tired of killing people he want to come to America to cut hair, a feeling made stronger when his arch rival whom he finally caught The terrorist named the Phantom, is revealed to have been traded for a low level spy and a spy to be named later. Faking his own death Zohan heads to America to live out his dream. Far from taxing this is an amusing, often low brow movie that is perfect for a rainy Sunday afternoon. The rapid fire jokes are more hit then miss which is a real plus. To be certain some of the film is stupid, but at the same time its good natured and forgivable. If there is any real flaw its the over use of the ""I'm tired of fighting, can't we all get along"" mantra. I appreciate the sentiment but at the same time by the second half I was full of the milk of human kindness and just wished that someone would do something funny. Definitely worth a look at some point, its one of the better Adam Sandler films.",You Don't Mess with the Zohan
15,zardoz-13,"""Zohan"" Will Keep Adam Sandler's Fans in Stitches!",8,16 June 2008,"Comedian Adam Sandler's last theatrical release ""I Now Pronounce You Chuck and Larry"" served as a loud and proud plea for tolerance of the gay community. The former ""Saturday Night Live"" funnyman's new movie ""You Don't Mess with the Zohan"" (*** out of ****) constitutes his plea for tolerance toward Israeli and Palestinian immigrants in America. These unfortunate people are often punished in America for the crimes of their counterparts in the war-ravaged Middle East. Although ""Zohan"" advocates a lofty cause, Sandler doesn't let his political agenda overshadow his usual crude, below-the-belt, juvenile shenanigans that rely on obscene bodily functions, promiscuous sex, and far-fetched harebrained idiocy. Indeed, the hysterical horseplay that Sandler and company revel in may distract you from the plight of these uprooted, misplaced misfits that had fled to Uncle Sam's shores because they believe America is a Utopia. Interestingly, Sandler plays a Jewish counterterrorist agent of the Mossad, Israel's secret police, with a hopelessly corny accent. Zohan's exploits appear to foreshadow Will Smith's upcoming ""Hancock."" Zohan is the best Jewish secret agent in the whole wide world. He is literally indestructible. He catches bullets in his nose. He can swim faster than a dolphin, and a razor-toothed piranha fish in his bikini swim trunks amuses him.Zohan (Adam Sandler) is cooking fish at the beach when his superiors interrupt his vacation and inform him that the dreaded Arab terrorist, the Phantom (John Turturro of ""Transformers""), is up to his old tricks again. Naturally, Zohan is furious! Actually, Zohan captured the Phantom three months ago, but the politicians have exchanged the Phantom for political prisoners. Now, Zohan must nab his nemesis again! The Phantom and Zohan tangle in a spectacular fight in the sea and Zohan doesn't survive. In reality, Zohan deliberately fakes his death so that he can immigrate to New York City and realize his life-long dream of cutting hair for Paul Mitchell. Zohan gives himself an obsolete Frankie Avalon haircut, trims his beard, and smuggles himself onto a plane bound for America. If what happens before his flight seems outlandish, once he is on the jet, he spends his time in the cargo hold with two fluffy dogs named ""Scrappy"" and ""Coco."" Zohan styles their hair from photos in his Paul Mitchell haircut book.At first, Zohan has no luck getting a job with Paul Mitchell, much less cutting hair. Zohan defends Michael (Nick Swardson of ""Reno 911, The Movie"") in a street brawl after a motorist blames Michael for his accident with a delivery truck. A grateful Michael invites Zohan to stay with his mother, Gail (Lainie Kazan of ""Dayton's Devils""), and him. Zohan practices cutting Gail's hair when he isn't having in lusty sex with her. Eventually, Zohan gets a job sweeping up hair at a salon owned by Dalia (Emmanuelle Chriqui of ""Wrong Turn"") who as it turns out is a Palestinian. Indeed, Zohan knows about her heritage but doesn't let it bother him. One day when one of Dalia's hair stylists doesn't show up, Zohan takes advantage of her absence to cut hair. Much to Dalia's surprise, Zohan wins the allegiance of the over sixty crowd. Older woman line up around the block to have him fashion their hair. After each session, Zohan takes each older lady in the back and assuages their sexual appetites.Meanwhile, a millionaire real estate developer Walbridge (Michael Buffer of ""Rocky Balboa"") hikes the rent to force Dalia and others like her out of her store to make way for his mall with a roller-coaster. Zohan surprises both Dalia and Walbridge's people and forks over the money for her to pay the rent. An angry Walbridge contacts a white supremacy group to ignite a neighborhood war between the Israelis and Palestinians. This happens about the same time that Zohan falls in love with Dalia. Perennial Sandler cohort Rob Schneider of ""Deuce Bigalow"" appears as a cretinous Palestinian named Salim who doesn't know the difference between nitroglycerin and Neosporin. He tries to blow up Zohan for an old grudge. It seems Zohan beat Salim up and stole his goat.""You Don't Mess with the Zohan"" qualifies as a surreal comedy. Scenarists Robert Smigel of ""Saturday Night Live,"" Judd Apatow of ""The 40-Year Old Virgin,"" and Sandler himself vigorously ignore the laws of logic in this zany comedy. The movie that most closely resembles ""Zohan"" is ""Little Nicky,"" because both characters boast supernatural abilities. ""You Don't Mess with the Zohan"" will keep Adam Sandler fans in stitches.",You Don't Mess with the Zohan
16,Boba_Fett1138,Would had been great and hilarious with a different script.,6,21 April 2012,"Strangely enough, this always had been a movie that I really wanted to see. It looked strangely appealing and hilarious to me and while the movie does appeal and become occasionally a funny one, it still is a heavily flawed movie that almost does more stuff wrong than right.There is nothing wrong with its main concept, which is crazy and fun and also nothing wrong with its main character, played by Adam Sandler. I only did wish it all would had been part of a different and better movie. The movie as it is right now is lacking too much with its story and its consistency, with just about everything.It's strange how the humor variates throughout the entire. The one moment it's just plain crazy, while the other it's being a more gross out type of humor. It doesn't even feel like there is a right balance and any consistency between its different comedy approaches. I'm sure that I would had liked the movie way better, if it was entirely like its, totally absurd, first 10 minutes.It also would had been more pleasant if its story didn't keep changing its priorities every 20 minutes, or so. There often is a completely different focus, as if the story was a compilation of 3 totally different scripts, that got thrown together. It should had made its mind up better about what it wanted to be exactly and not try out- and do so many different things with its story, as it does now.Because it keeps jumping so much all over the place and keeps changing its approach and focus constantly because of this, the different story lines also don't ever work out well enough. There really were some good ideas to work with here but again, it should had made some better and more direct choices. It either should had been a spy comedy about Zohan versus his archenemies Phantom, played by John Turturro, or about Zohan trying to make it as a barber and save the barber shop from closing down, or one in which he stopped the evil developer from building a mall, or one about the whole Israeli–Palestinian conflict. The movie now instead is featuring a bit of everything in it but nothing ever feels developed and handled well enough. Everything falls sort of flat by the end, since it all feels half developed and wrapped up too easily and really not satisfying enough at all, overall.The thing I do like about this movie is that's not afraid to make fun of Isreali's, something that's still a bit of a sensitive subject in Hollywood, for the obvious reasons that a lot of the people in power there are actually Jewish. It's nothing new for a movie to poke fun at Jewish people and customs but it is uncommon for a comedy to constantly do so, with its main character and its main plot. It's nothing too offensive by the way. I'm pretty sure that people of Jewish origin, with a sense of humor in them, can still really laugh at some of the situations and comedy elements in this movie.But really, for every good and fun thing that this movie does, there also is something truly bad. For instance there are a lot of sex jokes in this movie, which I normally have no problem with but the jokes in this movie are just a bit too gross for my taste. Every time that you think that there would be no way that this movie would be doing a certain thing, or would go that far, it actually does.Another thing that became annoying after a while were its many different cameos. Stuff like this often can take you out of a movie, as is also the case with this movie. It often pauses, just so it can show another celebrities face, for about 15 seconds.I really do wish that Adam Sandler would do another 'Zohan' movie, since there is so much potential with its character and craziness to do with it. Besides, it probably is the best comedy role he had ever done.6/10 http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",You Don't Mess with the Zohan

High-concept ridiculousness ensues thanks to a game cast, a surprisingly decent performance (and Israeli accent to boot too) by Sandler (who co- scripted the hit-and-miss comedy with Robert Smigel  who has a bit part, and quite frankly the film is an extended version of their SNL skit ""Sabra Shopping Network""), and comedy maven Judd Apatow), and some sweet chemistry with the waysexy Chriqui as the Palestinian hair salon owner who reluctantly allows him to learn the trade. Slapstick, one-liner zingers and some equally surprising political commentary (i.e. a laugh-out loud moment where Turturro's terrorist, The Phantom, plays paddle-ball using a grenade with Zohan is perhaps the best way to transcribe the Middle Eastern strife the likes of Mad Magazine come to life).

Adam Sandler plays Zohan, an Israeli counter terrorist who fakes his own death, only to embark on his dream in America as a hair stylist. While formula in structure director Dennis Dugan creates his best film to date after having made such embarrassments as Big Daddy and Problem Child. The terrorist jokes are hilarious but the sexual jokes are more stomach turning than funny. Sandler creates one of his best comic characters. Zohan desires to start new and reinvent himself with a more positive image. Jon Turturro steals scenes as a terrorist who secretly desires to be a shoe salesman. Emmanuelle Chriqui plays Zohan's love interest in what first gets drown in formula romantic clichés until a secret is revealed that adds a peaceful spin on the circumstance. Rob Schneider is hilarious as a Palestinian cab driver who holds a grudge against Zohan after losing his goat. He will inform Turturro of his whereabouts although that gains him even less respect. Nick Swardson plays a friend whom Zohan hooks up with and like anything Swardson does, he fails to be normal. Lots of gravity defying special effects are featured throughout as well as a message of starting over. Score: 9 / 10",You Don't Mess with the Zohan
19,FlashCallahan,Silky Smooth......,8,26 May 2012,"Zohan works as a Special Agent and lives with his orthodox parents in Israel.He wants to give up this life full of dangerous encounters with Palestinians. While in the process of apprehending a Palestinian activist known simply as the Phantom, he fakes his death, hides in a plane bound for New York, and decides to try his hand as a hair-stylist.He is refused employment initially, but when he offers to work for free, Dahlia hires him as a cleaner. When a hair-stylist quits, Zohan replaces her, winning over elderly female clients, and falling in love with Dahlia herself.Dahlia's landlord, Walbridge, who has been raising rents regularly, hires skinhead to terrorise the neighbourhood, create misunderstandings between cultures, and drive them out, so as to enable him to construct a new building.....Yes the film is completely insane, but it's still one of Sandlers funniest movies.This is because, it's so original, and the sight gags are rife throughout.Sometimes o stupid, you cannot help bu wonder if this man is a genius, or a true loon.The culture references are on the safe side of offensive, and Sandler plays his wild card by bringing all cultures together at the climax to make everything happy, happy, happy.And just when you thought things couldn't go anymore bizarre, Mariah Carey pops up as her self, and puts her best performance ever in this.It raises the laughs because of its over ambitious narrative, but you know you secretly laugh when this is on.",You Don't Mess with the Zohan
20,movieman_kev,You DON'T watch the Zohan,2,12 June 2008,"An indestructible seemingly-super human Israili agent (Adam Sandler) fakes his own death at the hands of an equally indestructible seemingly-super human Palestinian agent (John Turturro) in order to go to America to become a hairdresser and make everyone 'silky smooth'. The only job he can find is in a Palestinian hair salon which is being threatened by evil American businessman, Walbridge (Michael Buffer) who wants it (along with the rest of the neighborhood) out of the way to make room for a mega-shopping center.Firstly, congratulations MUST go to Dennis Dugan who has made not only one of the worst films of 2008 with this lame, unfunny and tedious bit of cheesy fluff, but has been making one of the worst movies of the years 2006 (The Benchwarmers) & 2007 (I Now Pronounce You Chuck & Larry). Back to the movie at hand, I found the 'film' to be overly long, tedious to watch and jaw-droppingly unfunny and like most films of this ilk way too infatuated in cramming as many nonsense cameos into the flick as possible. The story is embarrassingly bad and moronic. You don't watch the Zohan.My Grade: D-",You Don't Mess with the Zohan
21,Sylviastel,Don't Mess with Sandler!,8,9 June 2008,"I am a big Saturday Night Live. It should come as no surprise that I love Adam Sandler and the cast. The rest of the cast includes the zany Lainie Kazan, Rob Schneider, and John Turturro. The cast is first rate about a Mossad Israeli Agent Zohan who longs to bring silky and smooth hair to the world. He secretly keeps a Paul Mitchell book beneath his armed weapons. He fakes his death against the Phantom played by the wonderful Turturro who becomes a national hero. Aside the middle eastern politics, he escapes to America in a dog carriage with Scrappy and Coco. His new name is Scrappy Coco and is from Australia and Nepal. He gets a job at a Palestinian owned hair salon and falls in love with a Palestinian owner, Dahlia, of course. I won't spoil the plot because it's more about Middle Eastern politics. On one side of the street, it's Israeli and the other is Palestinian while the greater enemy of a businessman seeks to develop the area and tries to tear the two groups apart. It's interesting, funny, and if it can only bring peace to the Middle East or a smile, it's worth while.",You Don't Mess with the Zohan
22,mm-39,Why can not I give this movie a minus 1,1,9 June 2008,"I will use a Adam Sandler line to explain how I hated this film. In the same voice and tone as Adam did in Mr Deeds. You sick you sick. How could you? Again, your sick your sick how could? How could you make such a bad film. The movie has crotch style jokes. Sometimes and I say maybe sometimes such a joke is funny the first time, but not a entire movie. Again you sick you sick how could you Adam? The preview shows the few funny parts, and the real joke is on us the viewer spending $9 dollars on Sandlers latest production. Makes the infamous Weekend at Burnies look like the classic Groundhog day or Caddy Shack. I give this film a one. Run do not walk. Run run away fast from this film.",You Don't Mess with the Zohan
23,DICK STEEL,A Nutshell Review: You Don't Mess With The Zohan,8,21 June 2008,"Comedies go up against each other at the local box office, with Adam Sandler squaring off against Steve Carell, and incidentally, both lead characters in their movies are of the spy / special forces kind, with Sandler's Zohan Dvir being the top Israeli counter-terrorist operative, and Carell's Maxwell Smart thinking he's the best, working for the CONTROL organization to bring down KAOS. Just which agent will outdo the other remains to be seen, but I thought Zohan had opportunity before throwing it away when it goes back to the usual sacharrine sweet ending with a nicely inserted moral message of peace and harmony.Directed by Dennis Dugan who helmed comedies like The Benchwarmers and the recent Adam Sandler movie I Now Pronounce You Chuck and Larry, You Don't Mess With The Zohan has its title come across as a warning to those who cross the Zohan's path. In every sense of the word, Zohan is Israel's #1 superhero for his superhuman strength, speed, agility, and just about being as indestructible as Superman, without that heat ray bursting through his eyes. Having killed many in his lifetime, he seeks a life away from the glitz, glamour and hero worship in his homeland, and harbours a secret desire to style hair, with the ambition to make the world Silky Smooth!Going up against his arch-enemy The Phantom (John Turturro), he fakes his own death, and finds his way to New York, where under a pseudonym Scrappy Coco, he exhibits the much stereotyped mannerisms that all male hairdressers have broken wrists. Yes people, Zohan would be quite offensive to some, as the jokes come hard and fast when it comes to race (there are tons of Arab jokes here, mostly putting them in bad light), politics (even wives of prominent politicians are unspared) and plenty of sexual inneundoes, perhaps no thanks to the writing input from Judd Apatow, who gave us flicks like Superbad (super-sized dong anyone?), 40-Year Old Virgin, and the likes. If you don't mind politically incorrect flicks, then Zohan would be right up your alley, where no orifice is sacred.So has Sandler sunk to a new low? Perhaps not, but I think he's in need of a boost to his career, which seemed to have stagnated with fairly plain comedic flicks such as Longest Yard and I Now Pronounce You Chuck and Larry, and even Click, perhaps being loaded with a tad bit of drama and feel good messages. And it doesn't really help when personally I still think that Spanglish was his best non-comedic work which stuck to me, for some reason. He tries to reinvent himself, but I feel he's still quite a distance away from peers like Mike Myers who comes up with crazy characters every now and then (am looking forward to the troubled and controversial Love Guru), and even Sacha Baron Cohen (whom I'm looking forward to his Bruno).Here, Sandler's Zohan relies on both his amazing prowess to bring down the bad guys, as well as his over-sized crotch to seduce plus sized and elderly women who come visit him for a haircut, and extra special services he dishes out. Granted they bring on the laughs, and there were some really genuine funny moments to compensate for some expected laughs on the horizon. But aside from that, the story's pretty much lost its direction after the mid-way point, where it couldn't decide whether to be an all out romance flick, with Zohan getting stiff for his salon owner Dalia (Emmanuelle Chriqui), or to focus on the aged old dispute between the two cultures where fellow immigrants and enemies find out his true identity, and revive their aged old feud in a foreign land. There were some bewildering scenes that seemed to have, like the mentioned threads, been abandoned halfway, for example, with the rallying of troops to the game of Hacky Sack.Nonetheless, what's an Adam Sandler movie without the list of cameo appearances to spice things up? Here you get Rob Schneider who makes regular cameo or supporting character appearances in a Sandler movie, together with Chris Rock, Mariah Carey who hams up her Diva status, Kevin James his co-star from Chuck and Larry, and even George Takei, whom I thought was a strange cameo given that he just came out of the closet recently, and gets himself involved in a somewhat homophobic scene.You Don't Mess With The Zohan doesn't always hit the mark, but it surely has enough moments in its close to 2 hour runtime to make it worthwhile to sit through and enjoy. Only if you prefer your comedy to be politically incorrect, of course.P.S. Am just wondering how many will emulate that crazy accented ""Nononono"".",You Don't Mess with the Zohan
24,StevePulaski,A satire on the satires of satires,3,6 August 2012,"I feel like I either am unable to get most of Adam Sandler's schtick or simply can not warm up to him or his characters. His pictures seem to follow the same formula, centered around an intolerable character with a bizarre haircut, an unpleasant accent, and a personality I simply do not find at all intriguing. I've called them ""anti-character studies"" and You Don't Mess With the Zohan adheres to this typical groggy formula.Centered around a professional and highly flexible Israeli soldier, You Don't Mess With the Zohan's title character is a goofy, crude buffoon who dreams of leaving his stressful country, that seems to never be overcoming its hatred for Palestine, to become a successful stylist and beautician. After his family howls at his dreams, Zohan fakes his death and ventures out to America, where he quickly becomes popular, despite a few notable setbacks, such as Rob Schneider's Salim, a Palestinian cab driver who recognizes Zohan soon after he begins working at an upper-class beauty salon in New York.Much of the humor derives from Zohan's incredible ability to fight people, because of his impeccable and unassuming strengths. The ""anti-character study"" idea was knocking around my head when I realized here is a character erected from the ground up on stereotypes, uttering some of the most cringe worthy dialog backed by his oppressive accent, and is functioning in a world where few people have an IQ higher than him. Sandler has made films with more depressing and appallingly unconvincing characters, the lead in That's My Boy and The Waterboy to name a few, but Zohan could definitely be the character in his films I grew weary of the fastest. After about five or ten minutes I had already reached my capacity with this character. I guess I wouldn't want to mess with the Zohan, but I also wouldn't want to know him or even meet him either.Stretching this film out to near two hours in length is an act of audience masochism and the sad act of milking of an idea that is not clever, witty, or interesting. The film is watery, beyond reasonable length, and dull in more parts than it is funny. As expected, Sandler regulars like Rob Schneider and Nick Swardson get their time in the picture and, as one could also expect, they are unable to elevate was is already a film almost dead on arrival.I'm reaching my capacity for Sandler's comedic works and am likely to reposition myself in front of his dramas in the near future. What can I say? His comedy is mostly successful when he truly seems like he wants to do more than make the audience laugh at the sheer stupidity of everything; Big Daddy and Click come to mind. It's dense exercises of tedium and repetition like You Don't Mess With the Zohan that hurt him more than truly make me like him.Starring: Adam Sandler, John Turturro, Emmanuelle Chriqui, Nick Swardson, Lainie Kazan, and Rob Schneider. Directed by: Dennis Dugan.",You Don't Mess with the Zohan
25,Smells_Like_Cheese,"Stupid funny, one of the better Adam Sandler movies, but still he hasn't had a real hit since The Wedding Singer",5,17 June 2008,"Adam Sandler was recently given on MTV the Generation Award, he was praised for all the ""comedy"" has given us, from the good old days from Saturday Night Live all the way up to I Now Pronounce You Chuck and Larry. Back in the good old days up to Big Daddy Adam Sandler has always delivered big laughs and was a always a pleasure to watch on screen. But unfortunately, he's come out lately with the very predictable comedies where you could predict who was going to be in it, what lines would be said and what out come would happen. It hasn't been fun; Adam has also brought some dramatic roles that surprised us all such as Spanglish and Reign Over Me. He now brought us You Don't Mess with the Zohan going back into the funny accent like he did with his smash hit The Waterboy, sometimes offending us and sometimes just giving us some great laughs.Zohan is the top terrorist hunter in Isreal, everything could just keep going for him, but he hates all the fighting and his life long dream is to actually be a hair stylist. He fakes his death and runs away to America to start his dream, but things don't go so smoothly at first. After defending a man, Michael, from a jerk, Michael takes Zohan in. Zohan finds a little hair salon, he starts off as a sweeper, but then after a stylist quits, he takes a client and does a great job as well as, well, giving her all the satisfaction she could have. Zohan brings the shop's popularity back up while finding his true love, Dalia. But when a taxi driver that Zohan insulted sees him, all the hatred comes back to Zohan ten fold.You Don't Mess with the Zohan is a lot better than I Now Pronounce You Chuck and Larry in my opinion, but it's still not Sandler's best comedy. I don't think he's had such a great hit since The Wedding Singer, his comedies have just become so predictable and just... I know this is a bad word, dumb. You Don't Mess with the Zohan is offensive at times, I'm a white American, and I was offended for the Isreali culture, because Adam does take it a little far. Not to mention the hummus joke goes farther than it really should. But I do admit, there are some funny parts, I did laugh when he went into the children's salon and gave this kid the pinch and knocked him out. Sounds horrible, it's a funny scene though. You Don't Mess with the Zohan has it's moments, but if you ask me, I would recommend to wait for the rental.5/10",You Don't Mess with the Zohan
26,MovieAddict2016,Disappointing,4,25 July 2008,"Look, I'm not one of those snobby cinema elitists who scoffs and upturns their nose at every Adam Sandler film that comes out. ""Happy Gilmore"" is one of my all-time favourite ""guilty pleasures"" and he's done a lot of entertaining films that aren't by any means thought-provoking or life-altering but, for all practical purposes, are fun to watch. Paul Thomas Anderson was quoted as having said the only reason he cast Sandler in ""Punch-Drunk Love"" was due to the fact that he was a huge fan of Sandler's comedies, which he enjoyed viewing because they always put him in a good mood. I think this is about the best description of his work that you'll find, and pinpoints my own feelings.But once in a while Sandler will make a real turkey, and ""You Don't Mess with the Zohan"" is one of the worst. Ranking alongside ""Anger Management"" and ""Little Nicky,"" Zohan -- the character -- offers little to like or enjoy, and ""Zohan"" -- the movie -- is even worse. Sandler's character in ""The Waterboy"" was annoying but the film was still funny if you're in the right mood. ""Zohan's"" problem is that it has an unlikeable character put in very unfunny predicaments, and relies on truly lame social/cultural jokes. Sometimes these type of stereotypical jabs can be passable in the same way the crudeness of ""Happy Gilmore"" is somewhat endearing, but ""Zohan"" offers them in such a direct and unpleasant manner that you're really just left straining to *try* to laugh at most of this stuff. Jewish people are hairy and talk funny? Americans don't know the difference between Saudi Arabia and Iraq? People in the Middle East dress like it's still 1989? This is essentially the whole film's joke, rehashed over...and over...and over again.Zohan is not a strong character for Sandler. He's gimmicky, just like Little Nicky, but rather than feeling strongly one way or another about him -- I just felt indifferent. He's not funny, which is a crucial hindrance to a film proclaiming itself as a comedy.The movie is just very inept. I was surprised to find Dennis Dugan had directed it, because he's usually one of Sandler's better collaborators; yet this film is totally amateurish and incomprehensible. There's no real plot, and John Turturro is thanklessly wasted as a scenery-chomping villain. Emmanuelle Chriqui is beautiful but ultimately she's another in Sandler's long line of underwritten romantic interests. These characters are more excusable in his better comedies like ""Gilmore"" because we know the romance is unrealistic to begin with and is only there to fit a mold, but Chriqui is so earnest in her performance and displays so much promise that you are left *wanting* her to have a better script to work with. Sandler should embrace the concept of stronger romantic leads in his films, because I think it would vastly improve the storyline. Since ""Zohan"" is so lazy in its story and its romantic subplot is tacked-on and pointless, the other flaws of the film -- primarily the lack of funny material -- become far clearer.Speaking of weak material: Adam Sandler and Mike Myers seem to have recently both arrived at the conclusion that penis and sex jokes can sustain an entire comedy. They can't. The first time we see Sandler naked, it's a forced chuckle. When he has sex with a friend's mother to thank her for dinner and hospitality, it's a lame attempt at Borat-style cultural comedy. When Zohan begins cutting elderly women's hair in blatantly sexual manners and takes them all into the back office of a hair salon one-by-one for a sex montage of sorts, you just want to throw up a bit. I'm shocked that Sandler actually thought this material was funny. If he was going for ""gross-out"" laughter, then he fails on all levels. It's not funny, it's not gross, it's just *stupid* and off-putting.This movie is ultimately just disappointing because of how dull it is and how hard it tries -- or perhaps doesn't try -- in its effort to make teenagers laugh. The only thing I ever really look for in a typical Adam Sandler comedy is a fair amount of silly throw-away gags, raunchy or not. But ""Zohan"" can't even deliver on this -- its only real purpose. Hopefully Sandler and Myers will both grow out of this awkward sex-jokes-only phase of their careers. The underperforming box office results of both ""Zohan"" and ""The Love Guru"" may help them realize this sooner rather than later.",You Don't Mess with the Zohan
27,sddavis63,Will It Ever End?,2,8 March 2010,"For a moment, I had hope about Adam Sandler. I liked him in ""Reign Over Me."" He showed that he was capable of being an actor who could be both serious and funny - but then it hit me. He neither produced nor wrote ""Reign Over Me,"" which meant that movie avoided both the lame, juvenile humour so typical of almost all his other movies and the extremely irritating presence of Sandler's buddy Rob Schneider. ""Zohan,"" (co-produced and co- written by Sandler - which should have been my first warning) is unfortunately filled with both lame, juvenile humour and Rob Schneider. I was disappointed, to say the least, although perhaps I understand now - Sandler should simply act, rather than insist on writing or producing.The idea, admittedly, had some potential. The Zohan (played by Sandler) is an ex-Israeli commando-type, who gets tired of the fighting in the Middle East, and sets off to America to re-invent his life posing as an Australian-Tibetan hairdresser! This actually could have been funny, watching Zohan adjust to America, maybe becoming a vigilante-type doing battle against the evil of America. Instead, we have to watch Zohan (well, thankfully, not really watch) ""bang"" all the old ladies who come into the salon, and we get hummus joke after hummus joke. And, considering the type of lame humour that's featured here, there's nowhere near enough of substance to keep this going for almost two hours. Long before it's over, everything in it is tired, and you're simply wondering - will it ever end?""You Don't Mess With The Zohan"" - starring, produced by and written by Adam Sandler.

29,Robert_duder,"Dumb, awful, offensive...oh wait that is exactly what is to be expected!!",5,26 June 2008,"If anything You Don't Mess With The Zohan is a throwback to Sandler's less intelligent comedies like Billy Madison, Happy Gilmore, The Waterboy and then he started to find a niche in a different type of comedy with truly funny and often moving performances like Click, and The Wedding Singer. Zohan is probably just a little more his geeky childish side and holds no punches against the people in question much like he did last summer with I Know Pronounce You Chuck and Larry which did nothing for the gay community but poke fun at their lifestyle and Zohan does precisely the same thing with the middle Eastern community. That being said I don't really offend easily so it didn't bother me that much although I think it's a sore spot for the world right now. The movie around is ridiculous, corny, gross, dumb, poorly played out and yet somehow not the biggest waste of my time in the last week. Somehow it manages to be tolerable probably because of Sandler who is talented and probably because it does make you snicker at times even if you don't want to admit it. Remarkably a film like this would usually show the truly funny parts in the trailer and for the most part that is true BUT those same parts are still pretty funny in the movie too.Adam Sandler plays Zohan an anti-terrorist expert who is basically a one man army. He can do just about anything but all he wants to do is leave war behind and cut and style hair ""make it silky smooth."" Sandler is....Sandler. I mean Zohan is kind of a funny character in a stupid over the top, high school play kinda way but yet he's watchable. The ridiculous stunts and CGI special effects that make him unhuman are mostly stupid but honestly I think that's the point. Over the top is funny...sometimes. Outside of Sandler the film is chock full of cameo faces to make up the rest of the crew. John Turturro (who is way too talented to be in this) is forgettable as Zohan's arch nemesis The Phantom. Emmanuelle Chriqui is beautiful but doesn't really stand out as Zohan's boss and love interest Dalia. Rob Schneider manages to get another job via his buddy Sandler as a middle Eastern terrorist who manages to insult every aspect of Middle Eastern culture and they just go too far with the jabs. A high point of the film is infamous boxing announcer Michael Buffer as a crazed and evil real estate developer. He is awesome as a bad guy and really terrific in the role!! Kevin Nealon shows up for a small cameo as does Charlotte Rae (Mrs. Garrett anyone on Facts of Life?) 82 years old she is!! Then check out this cameo list of guest stars...Mariah Carey in a fairly large role, Chris Rock, John McEnroe, George Takei, Bruce Vilanch, and the amazing Henry Winkler. So if you see Zohan it will be to check out all the cool cameos cause it won't be for true laughter.The reason I'm not shredding You Don't Mess With The Zohan is simple...the film is exactly what they meant it to be. They made it bad, they knew it was over the top, crude, stupid humor and ninety million bucks says everyone thinks thats okay so who am I to argue? Plus somehow I didn't walk out of it wishing I had that hour and a half back as stupid as I felt it was. Director Dennis Dugan also worked with Sandler on Chuck and Larry and this film does exactly the same sort of thing although I THINK Chuck and Larry was slightly, minutely more intelligent than this. So if you like Sandler's more stupid comedy than Zohan is for you but if not then steer clear because this one is a stinker of a so called comedy that you won't miss much by missing this summer. I can't believe The Love Guru could be worse than this but we will see. 5/10",You Don't Mess with the Zohan

31,dromasca,"not funny, not authentic",4,1 August 2009,"It is not easy to make comedy on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. There is such an amount of tragedy around it that one probably feels the need to be careful in approaching such a theme. There are multiple dangers in doing it - the danger of hurting sensibilities, of looking like siding with one or the other of the parties involved, of being too daring or being too politically correct. Probably some of these dangers are unavoidable but there is one danger that cannot be forgiven when we are dealing with comedy - the danger of not being funny.This is the principal problem with this film being in my opinion almost a total failure despite the money and talent that was put into it. The second one is that it is totally unauthentic when dealing with the Middle East and its inhabitants. It almost looks like the authors made a movie not about the Middle East but about the stereotypes of the Middle East. No effort was made into creating anything authentic, no effort into researching minimally how such characters look or behave like (or even in how is houmous is eaten). This may be still OK, but then why the politically correct and moralistic ending a la 'West Side Story'? If the makers of the movie decided already to be dis-respectful with details, they would have done better to be also more daring in their tone of approaching their own reflection of reality. Learn something from Borat! In the absence of any original thinking or authentic approach we are left with a collection of ethnic jokes and sexual gags that could have been part of any other escapist and low-humor Hollywood comedy. And mostly not funny at all.",You Don't Mess with the Zohan
32,MLDinTN,one of the funniest films I've seen in a long time,8,22 April 2009,"When this movie came out, I remember hearing about a bunch of bad reviews for it and that it was supposed to be stupid. Well, I have a completely different opinion. Sure, some things are silly, but they are supposed to be. I found it to be very funny. I thought Zohan was the best character Adam Sandler has done. I loved the jean shorts, the catching the fish with his *ss, the soccer kicking the cat, the shampooing the old ladies, just the way her acts at the hair saloon, and giving all the old ladies a happy ending, the name Scappy Coco, the neighborhood watch, and on and on. It was all very funny. This movie had one of the funniest lines I've ever heard when Zohan says to Dahlia, "" I want to make sticky with you"", like that was some kind of sweet compliment. And then she acts like she's not really offended by it.As for the plot, Zohan is a top Isreal spy. He gets tired of fighting the bad guys, so he fakes his death and moves to New York to be a hair dresser. He's recognized in New York so he must deal with the Phantom again. Also, he takes up the fight against the big businessman, Walbridge whom is out to knock down the buildings in the area where the hair saloon is.FINAL VERDICT: I thought it was hilarious, see it.",You Don't Mess with the Zohan

There are a few laughs to be had, but I was not laughing very hard as I usually do in a Adam Sandler movie. In fact, this movie disappointed me on many levels and this is one of his worst.This film is about a terrorist hunter who wants to go to America to enjoy a new life as a hairstylist.As I stated previously, Sandler usually is very funny. Not so much in this film. His accent was very annoying for starters and his jokes were not amusing. However, John Turturro and Rob Scheinder do all they can to save this movie.Overall, this is not a very funny film. There are some moments but the majority of Sandler films are better than this.

34,The-Sarkologist,Probably one of Sandler's Worst,2,7 November 2021,"This is probably the worst Adam Sandler movie that I have ever seen. In fact it was getting very close to being the first Adam Sandler movie that I was going to turn off half way through - yes, it was that bad. Surprise, surprise, it still made money because Adam Sandler movies really seem to have this habit of being really bad, but still making lots and lots of money.What is interesting is that it is based on a true story, namely an Israeli counter-terrorist expert that decided that he no longer wanted to do that job and instead quit and became a hair dresser in Los Angeles. One of the major differences, other than being really, really stupid, is that it is set in Sandler's home town of New York - Brooklyn I suspect.One of the interesting things about the film is that it highlights the Arab-Israeli conflict, as well as exploring the idea that we should go out and follow our dreams. While in part it sounds as if it is about a conflict that the protagonist is going to have with one of the terrorists that he knew back in Israel, it turns out that it is in fact a property developer that is the antagonist, and that both the Arabs and the Jews have a common enemy.In a way it is one of those films that basically asks the question of why we can't just be friends. The thing is that the conflict is happening on the other side of the world, and they actually moved to the United States to get away from it, so they really shouldn't be continuing the fight here.Sure, the ideas that are explored here are important, but the problem is that this film is just really, really, silly and I certainly won't be watching it ever again.",You Don't Mess with the Zohan

So when I watched it, I was confused with all the compliments. This movie is not that funny, it has a few parts that were jokes but the most of it is just pure stupidity and really dull. Adam Sandler is a great actor in this movie but that's pretty much it, the story line is weird and the plot is wack. They include way too much sexual content and dirty jokes. Its about an Israeli soldier, Zohan who wants out of the army/war and wants to change his life to cut hair in America. The movie also felt very long and towards the end it was really boring. This is one of Adam Sandler's worst movie to date, IMO. Don't bother watching it",You Don't Mess with the Zohan
37,Movie_Muse_Reviews,"Sandler's ""Zohan"" gives his comedy a slight makeover",7,28 October 2008,"How refreshing to see Adam Sandler not playing some character where he's a foul-mouthed East-coaster with no regard for other people that for some reason has an emotional side. ""You Don't Mess With the Zohan"" might not be comedic gold, but it's much fresher than anything Sandler has put out in years.What makes ""Zohan"" different is that Sandler plays an Israeli, in particular a super-human Moussad agent who has spent his whole life fighting Arab terrorists. For the first time, some semblance of Israeli culture has actually been brought to the big screen. I have to mention that I'm familiar with Israel and have met many Israelis, so what I brought to this movie was much more than what an average movie-goer would. With that said, Sandler definitely spoofs Israeli culture in a friendly way while also catering in a way toward American/national audience that would still be seen as funny and not merely an ""inside-joke."" The movie is definitely funnier if you are on the inside, but it's still unique and true to Sandler's ridiculous fashion no matter what.Sandler and co-writers Robert Smigel (SNL) and Judd Apatow (no intro necessary) decide to give us a story that reverses archetypes--instead of the protagonist who dreams of being a hero, Zohan, an incredible physical specimen (and absurdly so to all ends) dreams of being a hair stylist. But forget the plot, it's just an excuse to put Zohan in situations where the writers can create ridiculous goofs for him. I'm going to go into detail about the Palestinian terrorist side of the plot because it's just dumb. Don't see Sandler films if you require solid plot structure in all your movies.In terms of Israeli-Arab conflict, the film does address it directly, trying to make the point that in America the fighting between both sides disappears. It doesn't lean any particular way and it definitely equally makes fun of both groups. It's more or less a depiction that pays no real mind to sensitivity, staying objective by just making fun of Middle Easterners. Some would actually be bothered by the film, but I think many would like it too. It's just the kind of conflict Sandler invites.I wouldn't call ""Zohan"" great comedy, but Sandler's humor is sort of revitalized in this more transformative role. It's also the first comedy to really use digital effects impressively, like when they play hacky sack with a cat. It ends up being another ridiculous comedy, but with a little more wit in terms of characterization.",You Don't Mess with the Zohan
38,Vartiainen,Funny yet flawed,4,28 November 2016,"A late 00s Adam Sandler film where an Israeli special ops superhero decides to quit with the constant fighting and move to America in order to become a hairdresser. In his own words he's there to make everything ""silky smooth"".Yeah, it's silly. But I cannot claim that it does not have certain charm of its own. Adam Sandler's particular style of comedy suits silly, over the top plots like this and the movie is self-aware enough to dance around most of the obvious pitfalls.That being said, the movie is pretty painful no matter how you take it. The Jew jokes are plentiful and quite obvious, the Palestine jokes are even worse and the whole premise of there being quite literal superhumans fighting on both sides of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict makes a mockery of the whole thing. Granted, I do admire the way the film eventually makes its case for mutual appreciation and tries to show the similarities between the two peoples. But it's still pretty painful most of the time.I do admit that I like this film, albeit in a guilty pleasure kind of way. It's nonsensical and stupid, but in a funny way. Adam Sandler has made much worse films in my opinion.",You Don't Mess with the Zohan
39,Turfseer,No moral equivalence between 'The Phantom' and 'The Zohan',5,30 March 2009,"'You don't mess with the Zohan' is a farce about an Israeli Army special operations counter-terrorist soldier who decides to chuck his career and become a hairdresser in New York. Adam Sandler is very funny as 'The Zohan' right down to the perfect Israeli accent. Since this is a farce, Sandler embraces the stereotype of the typical macho, sexually aggressive Israeli male and the type is exaggerated even further through the use of digital effects.The first half of the film contains some very funny scenes. I was laughing hysterically when The Zohan expresses his great displeasure that his arch-rival, The Phantom, has been set free after a prisoner swap. Watch for the banter between The Zohan and his Commander as Zohan 'negotiates' his way into volunteering for the mission (also watch for hummus joke #2 where The Zohan dips his chocolate bar into the hummus!)There's a great scene when The Zohan meets his parents. The father scoops hummus with his eyeglasses and praises him for his abilities as a commando (""You're like a Rembrandt with a grenade"", his father tells him).When The Zohan tries to capture The Phantom, his Commando skills are exaggerated to the point of being completely ridiculous. The Zohan can grab bullets and chops guns up with his hands. When the Phantom blows up a marketplace, the Zohan hands one of the merchants a card for 'free government reparations'. There's also a clever scene where the Zohan can swim like a porpoise and catches up to the Phantom who is fleeing in a speedboat. Before The Zohan arrives in NYC, watch how he gets his name ""Scrappy Coco"". When he attempts to get his first job at the Paul Mitchell Studio, we're introduced to the running gag of the night vision glasses (when he spies the unhelpful salon employee through the goggles, she's classified as ""Bitchy Bitch"" but her ass is ""good"").The Zohan gains an ally when he saves a gay delivery guy from being beaten up by a surly businessman on Park Avenue. During this scene, The Zohan twists the businessman into a pretzel shape--it's a another running gag that's repeated too often throughout the movie. Another unfunny bit that misses the mark is when The Zohan ends up in the African-American salon and mistakes a wig for some kind of wild animal and wrestles with it on the floor. It was just too out of character for the cool Zohan to do something as ridiculous as that.The Zohan's old friend from Israel, Uri, who he meets at a disco, proves to be one of the funniest characters in the film. In a most amusing scene, we're introduced to Uri's electronics store and how all the shady characters operate there. Uri's ""dreamkiller"" monologue is priceless!Another hilarious moment is The Zohan's dream flashback where a terrorist cuts off his hand and then The Zohan's hand on its own stabs the terrorist in the back. Loved it!When The Zohan finally lands a job at a salon owned by a beautiful Palestinian woman, there are a lot of sight gags such as the Zohan brushing his teeth with hummus and slow motion shots of him diving to the floor to prevent pieces of hair from dirtying up the salon. The main joke is The Zohan having no compunctions about servicing the old women clients. It's a joke stolen from Mel Brook's 'The Producers' but he takes it a couple of steps further. The idea of the stud having sex with the little old women gets tired pretty quickly.While the focus remains on The Zohan, the film is funny and keeps your interest. But once the focus shifts to the Palestinian characters, the Zohan begins to lose steam. The writers attempt to draw some kind of moral equivalence between the terrorist Phantom and The Zohan which fails miserably. Where the over-sexed Zohan is ripe for satire, the idea of The Phantom, a bumbling middle-aged terrorist, who deep down would like to own a shoe store, is too distant from reality to be funny. Simply put, there is no such thing as a bumbling terrorist—you cannot make terrorists into buffoons.One gets a feeling (especially with the Palestinian cabdriver character played by Rob Schneider and his two cabdriver buddies), that the writers didn't know enough about the Palestinian or Arab culture to create reasonable caricatures to satirize. By reducing them all to bumbling buffoons but also linking them to such unsavory activities as building bombs, the humor is lost. It might have been better to draw a portrait of an Americanized Arab family (perhaps focusing on Dahlia's extended family—the Zohan's love interest) which would have created more comic possibilities in the second half of the film.The second half features a good number of scenes that no longer focus on The Zohan's journey exclusively: the developers coming to the salon, the board meeting, the red neck plotters and Hacky Sack Mania. Contrast that with the first half where the focus was exclusively on The Zohan's struggle. The Zohan is a clever idea that runs out of steam. The message of the film—why can't people from different cultures get along—is really a misguided fantasy. 'The Zohan' wants to have it both ways: on one hand it glorifies (despite the affectionate ribbing), The Zohan's fight against terrorists; clearly Sandler is on the side of the Israelis. But at the end, he's able to have the Israelis and the Arabs hug each other after turning the Arab characters into harmless buffoons. Instead of all the silly slapstick, The Zohan could have had a lot more bite. Why couldn't there be more clever stuff like when the White Supremacist tells Walbridge, ""you're a rich guy who gets it—you and Mel Gibson!"" If there were only more moments like that!",You Don't Mess with the Zohan
40,DarkVulcan29,It was bad as Mr.Deeds was.,2,8 June 2008,"Adam Sandler rarely picks a bad movie project, with the exception of Mr.Deeds(2002) which I could say was pretty awful, and You Don't Mess With the Zohan is right beside Mr.Deeds. This film I thought was gonna be enjoyable slapstick comedy. But it was instead, a unwatchable excuse for sex gags that would make you say ""EEEWWW"". I loved the slapstick when it was shown. But the sickening gags were not needed. I understand it is a comedy, and I did not take it seriously, I understand that they went over the top with it's comedy, but they didn't half to keep going further with it.

41,PWNYCNY,Three cheers for the Zohan!,10,3 June 2009,"One of the funniest, if not THE funniest movie produced by Hollywood in years. Adam Sandler is at his very best as an Israeli Jew who goes from military hero to hairdresser. Most intriguing about this movie is its premise. The Zohan is a superhero, but not just any hero, he is a Jewish superhero, with superhuman powers that heretofore were reserved for the likes of Superman, etc, but now are embodied in a Jewish man who, on top of that, is also a hairdresser and enjoys kibitzing. There are references to the current situation in the Mideast but they are secondary to the story of the Zohan who can out-bat the Batman and out-schmooze the funniest stand up comics. This movie takes the whole superhero genre in a new and very humorous direction. Three cheers for the Zohan!",You Don't Mess with the Zohan
42,meeza,This Zohani Desert is not dry with laughs!,9,9 June 2008,"I have no other choice but to give a favorable recommendation to the new Adam Sandler flick ""You Don't Mess With The Zohan"". I do not want it to get messy with the Sandman if I dis the flick. I have enjoyed a few of Sandler's flicks (The Wedding Singer, Punch Drunk Love, Mr. Deeds) while others I have found them to be in No Man's Cinema Land (50 First Dates, Anger Management, Click). Zohan does fall in the former instead of the No Man's Land latter. ""You Don't Mess With The Zohan"" stars Sandler as the title character who is a tough-as-nails Israeli Mossad Agent who fakes his death in order to immigrate to New York to be a hairstylist. There he achieves hair-raising success as a stylist in a Palestinian beauty salon; where along with servicing his female geriatric clients with hairstyling services, he also presents them some additional Zohanic organic fringe benefits in the backroom Wild Zohari. The Great Zohani even falls for the beautiful beauty salon owner Dalia played by the bella actress Emmanuelle Chriqui. Eventually Zohan does get into hairy situations when a longtime Palestinian nemesis named ""The Phantom"" phantoms his way to New York to find Zohan, and another Zohan nemesis comes in the form of a Palestinian cab driver named Salim who wants to avenge Zohan for stealing his goat in the east country many years ago. Sandler spiked up the laughs as Zohan in a few outlandish scenes that will be embedded in your cinematic scalp for days to come. The Moosead, I mean Mossad Agent Zohan's comedic-action sequences also made the cut in sheer entertainment value. The great John Turturro was uproarious as Phantom; and even Rob Schneider, yes that Rob Schneider, was no acting goat and was wonderfully zany as Salim. The film was co-scripted by Sandler and it is quite evident by the numerous ""Sandlerisms"" in numerous scenes. ""You Don't Mess With The Zohan"" might be an exercise in guilty-pleasure futility, but it is styled to be most probably the funniest film of the year. ***** Excellent",You Don't Mess with the Zohan

In the grand tradition of ""Billy Madison"", ""Happy Gilmore"" and ""The Waterboy,"" Adam Sandler again comes up with a most outrageous title character.Zohan is a top-notch Israeli special forces soldier which practically super-human powers. However, he is tired of that life, and he would want nothing more than to go to America and try his luck in....Hairstyling! That in capsule is the whole stupid plot, as stupid and hilarious as those various Mariah Carey baby t-shirts that he wears throughout the film.And they manage to fill the 113 minute running time up with what seemed to be non-stop crude sexual jokes It is also replete with very daring Jew, Palestinian and Arab jokes. OK, some jokes fall flat (one can only take too much crotch close-ups and ethnic double entendres!), but yes, in general they are funny. The first scenes of Zohan under cover on the beach is one long laugh-out-loud sequence. Also Zohan's exciting yet side-splitting fight scene with his nemesis, the Phantom (John Turturro).As for acting, this was Classic Adam Sandler all throughout. He has not lost his comic touch. Rob Schneider has a supporting role as an Arab (?) whose goat was stolen by Zohan. I never saw Rob look more Filipino than in this film (because of his make-up)! There is also a very surprising cameo appearance of an unexpected celebrity somewhere in the film, though it was definitely not in the league of Bob Barker in ""Happy Gilmore."" Overall though, it is brash and shallow fun (especially if you are not from the Middle East).

47,aharmas,Is there a message here,6,8 June 2008,"""Zohan"" takes Sandler and his troop further down the road to enlighten the audience. Here is a comedy with a message of peace of brotherhood, buried deep down in some rather crude jokes and plenty of sexual innuendo. Much of it is funny, and years ahead of the stuff than other ""funny"" men have been delivering lately. Sandler doesn't pretend he is much more than a man who can be very silly, has a good heart, and knows how to make fun of himself. What is most important is that he can be hilarious.Sadly, this comedy is not as funny as it could be. For some unknown reason, the chemistry of entire package is at best bland, even though some of the work done by Kazan, Matthews, and Turturo is pretty good. Some of the stuff in the movie is bound to offend more than a few people in the audience because it is given to us in heavy doses. It is not enough to hit the target once; Sandler and company make sure that we're hit over the head with the jokes, the visuals, the lines, and the ""message"".""Zohan"" might not ever come back in a sequel, and it won't be missed, but it did show a more physical side of Sandler, in more ways than one. It explores the absurdity of contemporary disagreements in some parts of the world, and how it has taken away our right to just enjoy a simple life, where we seek normal everyday pleasures and freedoms. From its opening acrobatics in Asia to the climatic reconciliation in New York City, ""Zohan"" can be lots of fun, with the spirit in the right place, but we can only wish someone had invested more time in putting the package together.Yet, if we take the way it is, one is bound to have a decent time at the movies. I shudder to think had this project landed in the hands of other ""talent"" without the ability to project more than one single emotion and pass it as comedy. At least, Sandler is fully capable of convincing us that there is somewhere on this planet a superman, with a super heart, and the vision to believe that we can still heal our wounds.",You Don't Mess with the Zohan

But he is recognized and in the end his own life comes back to haunt him. But the neighborhood has worse problem than friction between Israelis and Palestinians. The landowner wants to tear it all apart and build a new mall, but maybe Zohan can help Comments: Juvenile, almost obsessed with sex, and often ridiculously over the top, but not without its own charm. Despite myself I actually found myself laughing at times, so it is not as bad as it seems sometimes.What I don't really get is why Sandler don't clean up his movies, he does have the talent to do it, most notably shown in Reign Over Me. I actually think that he could have made quite a few of his comedies better, including Zohan, if he had taken a more serious approach. In Zohan he also got some good support in Turturro but his role is almost a waste. Then Schneider got a bigger role, but he has never impressed me much, and not this time either.A bonus feature, and quite a good one, is that Zohan is rather stacked with cameos. A few of Sandlers comedian colleagues appears as well as other celebrities.

Yup, it could all come across as REALLY racist too, even though Sandler is famously, outspokenly Jewish so maybe he gets a pass?

50,dierregi,Life would be better as a farce than as a tragedy,3,12 August 2017,"While I was watching this movie, I thought about the enraged reviews it probably generated. The plot is about a super-Mossad agent (the titular Zohan), who lives in Israel but is fed up with killing and just wants to be a hairdresser. He fakes his death and moves to New York City, where Palestinian and Jewish people live more or less peacefully in the same area. There, he starts working for a Palestinian girl who owns a hair saloon, falls for her and has to face his past. Obviously, one does not watch a Sandler's movie expecting a serious plot, and with Apatow as one of the scriptwriters the level went down even further. I am not a fan of either but I watched the movie on TV hoping for some fun. Turns out that apart from too many juvenile sex jokes and one unforgivable scene with a cat, the story was entertaining in a politically incorrect way. The plot makes fun of several stale movie clichés, such as the indestructible action hero, the irresistible lover, the deadly Arab terrorist, the hummus-eating Jews, etcOn the other hand, some of the jokes were of poor taste or simply idiotic, like the one with the cat.Despite the predictability of the plot and the crudeness of the scenario the movie might deserve a bit more than 1 point, for the following reason: the Zohan is a ridiculous but deadly killing machine and so is his Palestinian counterpart, the Phantom, but once they move far enough from the source of their problems, they do not want to fight anymore. This is clearly simplistic, but just for a moment I thought that the world would be a better place if people would let go of whatever reason they think they have to go on killing.

The only film he has ever done that i loved was "" Reign Over Me"" and that was a serious role. I also liked The Wedding Singer but that is ten years old now. So you can imagine my expectations were not very high for You Don't mess with the Zohan but surprisingly i found it quite amusing!Tired of all the fighting in his country, legendary Israeli commando Zohan (Adam Sandler) fakes his own death and goes to New York, where he can fulfill his fondest dream: to become a hairstylist. Zohan's sexy way with a cut and curl makes him a hit with Manhattan's women, but when enemy Arabs spot him, Zohan has to call on his military skills if he is ever to wield scissors again.There is one reason why Sandler makes movies like Zohan and not quality movies like Reign Over Me and you only have to go to IMDb.com to see why. You don't mess with the Zohan cost $90m to make and has so far has took $201m at the box office worldwide. Reign over me cost $20m to make and took $20.1m at the box office. For the studios it's a "" no Brainer"" Films like Zohan make money.You cannot for one minute have a serious head on when you watch this film . It is incredibly silly and childish but it IS funny. There were several moments i laughed out loud and for that to happen in a Sandler film it has to funny. There were quite a few Jewish references that went over my head but there was still enough to keep me amused. I loved the Hummus references and there was one moment when the old man dipped his glasses in the pot and sucked off the Hummus that had me close to tears.The thing about Zohan having sex with all the pensioner is a little weird and unsettling , who wants to see an 80 year dressed up in a sexy outfit?? Not me that's for sure . Luckily there is the beautiful Emmanuelle Chriqui to counteract those moments.There are a few famous stars that make cameo roles such as Mariah Carey , Chris Rock and John McEnroe but the funniest by far is by George Takei (Sulu from Star Trek) when he is interrupted having a free for all gay party!

It's a very political movie, though the comedy makes it palatable: this is sort of Sandler's point though. Basically, war and fighting is stupid: why do that when we can laugh, love and be happy together. Ultimately it is a wonderful message, and I agree with it.There is some secondary messaging about racist America and anti-capitalist, which has some irony to it as it takes big business to make movies against big(ger) business.The other purpose was to let Sandler start playing with quality action effects while still making ridiculous comedy.Zohan and Phantom are basically middle eastern supers (like the Avengers), and while I'd like to agree that they're just top quality agents: the physics don't line up.Regardless, seeing politics and harsh reality in my escapist comedies sort of ruins the escapism for me.Hopefully there are demographics that really enjoy this, and I'm not saying don't watch, just go in with expectations set.",You Don't Mess with the Zohan

Dishes out the same material here and brings nothing new to the comedy genre and uses old and tired jokes over and over.Expect to see the usual cameos when you watch a Sandler film, none of them are funny. Sandler himself stretches really far for some laughs, digging into his bag of stupid characters he pulls out Zohan. Who is an Israeli super soldier, able to catch bullets and what-not. He wants to leave the violence and war behind to pursue his dream in America, to cut hair. Is that suppose to be funny? Anyways, he gets rejected everywhere, until he lands a job cleaning up the hair at some low rent hair cutting place run by the beautiful Emmanuelle Chriqui, who just so happens to have absolutely no chemistry with Sandler. Yet we are suppose to believe these two fall for each other. Rob Schnieder plays the same character we always see, and always not laugh at.Like Sandler's last film, this one tackles some political issues. Whereas Chuck and Larry spoke out homosexuals, this one is on racism and the war in the middle east.

He soon earns a cult following for his styling antics, turning the once-struggling salon into a thriving business and causing Sandler to reassess his commitment to the dangerous, globe-trotting profession.It's comic-like farce with Sandler hamming it up to the absolute extreme in his vulgar, stereo-typical Lothario characterisation which is sure to offend some of the more austere viewers. Predictably, frequent Sandler collaborator Rob Schneider has a sizable supporting role as a maniacal taxi driver and would-be terrorist, while several 'celebrities' make self-parodying cameos (e.g. John McEnroe, Mariah Carey).Flimsy storyline is propped up somewhat by the hair salon tangent, a joke that starts off hilarious but soon becomes a little monotonous after the first dozen slow-motion soap-sudded climaxes. If it potentially bothers you, I don't think the film trivialises the Palestinian-Israeli tension, it's quite secular and the characters so outrageous there's little doubt that it's a free-for-all.

The Jewish man replies, ""because they think we are you.""I stayed with this for the entire week (seemed like) to see if there was anything that would have made my friend see or hear something I might like. Sorry, no. If only Zohan's dream was to become a used car salesman, then I could see merit in that especially if Sandler really had a liking for it too. I say this because comedy is not for Adam Sandler. Selling cars, maybe. Drama? Ummight work.There are loads of sexual innuendo in here and some not so veiled, in fact many, many not so veiled. In fact that is half the movie, and some people apparently like it..teenage males.Cameo appearances by John McEnroe, George Takei, Chris Rock, Bruce Vilanch and Mariah Carey were good but didn't really help the effort along. Nice to see Shelly Berman who played Zohan's father and he is still good.To sum up, this is a movie attempt to bring us all together and one can still hear the words of Rodney King, ""Can't we all just get along?"" Well, apparently not because this was tedious, unfunny and way too long and kind of makes me want to go to war about it. Violence: Yes. Sex: Yes, several simulations are seen. Nudity: Yes, backsides.

56,Lady_Targaryen,The worst movie I saw in 2008! (No Kidding!!),2,21 May 2009,"Zohan is a Special Agent from Israel, but his dream is to be a hairdresser. Decided to pursuit his dream, he fakes his death during the pursuit of a rival agent named ""Phantom"" and goes to America, precisely New York. He has a lot of problems to get a job in a salon, until he is hired to work in the salon of a Palestinian woman named Dalia. Proving to have talent as a stylist and pleasing old ladies with sex, Zohan makes a lot of success, specially among the elder women. He also meets Michael, a guy who eventually becomes his friend and offers Zohan his house to stay for sometime. But Zohan's fame will bring him some problems too, and after he falls in love with Dalia, a big confusion is going to start.This movie is the worst thing I saw in 2008. It is boring,annoying and I didn't even had the nerves to watch until it ended. It's so Lame!! Why Adam Sandler would make a horrible movie like that is beyond my comprehension,specially because he has a potential to be a much better comedian then that! They tried to copy the Borat formula of a hairy naive foreigner from a middle east country with a strong accent, but they didn't have the same success in doing that.Nobody should watch this movie, unless they want to suffer for almost 2 hours of boredom and stupidity.",You Don't Mess with the Zohan

58,dunmore_ego,Political Palestinian-Israeli Zionist Hairdresser Sex Comedy.,6,15 July 2010,"YOU DON'T MESS WITH THE ZOHAN messes with our brains. Because it's actually funny. Messing with our preconceptions that Sandler is a mindless jerk, writers Sandler, Robert Smigel and the great Judd Apatow give us ridiculous piled on absurd and nipple-pinched by insane. And thankfully, mediocre director Dennis Dugan (his IMDb directorial ratings read like a prescription for beige) doesn't ruin things. Israeli Special Forces operative, Zohan (Sandler) is sick of his superspy life of capturing and killing Palestinians in holy wars, so fakes his death and sneaks into America on a plane (""the terrorists"" have shown us how easy that is) to follow his dream of styling hair in New York. The movie unexpectedly tipped into quality when Zohan ""auditions"" for the salon of svelte Palestinian Dahlia (Emmanuelle Chriqui) with ""no-handed"" pushups. I couldn't help the milk squirting out of my nose in laughter. And I wasn't drinking milk at the time. His worked-out body exposed in wild abandon, his jock-pouch bulging with cushioning bush, his surfwave Avalon 'do rivaling Ace Ventura's for creamy goodness, Sandler has found his comedy stride in ZOHAN, not stooping to his implausible jutting-jawed jerk to ""try"" to be funny. His Middle Eastern accent is so perfect, I thought I was listening to Osama bin Laden. Now if only he could get the stanque of talentless tool Rob Schneider out of his skirts... Schneider is an olive-skinned Palestinian taxi driver. Okay, let's talk about something else. Zohan eventually gets his chance to style old ladies' hair - which involves more sexual healing than actual haircutting. Back in HAPPY GILMORE (1996), Sandler nonchalantly plonked that old Japanese lady - here, he takes geriatric sex to a new level of eeuuw! Incognito in America, Zohan maintains he is from Australia. His first BBW lover comments: ""You don't sound Australian."" Zohan: ""That's because I am half Australian, half Mount Everest."" BBW: ""It's so much nicer in Australia since they got rid of the apartheid."" Zohan: ""Yes, the weather is much cooler."" Zohan's Palestinian nemesis, The Phantom (John Turturro, also with a Middle Eastern accent that would warrant jihad anywhere outside of this movie) runs a successful franchise in America called Phantom Muchentuchen. Pointless, but damn, it sounds funny. Israeli Zohan and Phantom must team up to defeat a common enemy - racist Americans against Arabs. Film is chock full of snide political observations about the idiocy of the Palestinian-Israeli conflict, which I doubt Sandler's target audience would grasp. And considering the Israeli-Palestinian conflict shows no signs of abating, we can safely say the Israelis and Palestinians must therefore have the brain capacity of Adam Sandler fans.Cameos by Henry Winkler, Chris Rock, and the highly unfunny Kevin Nealon, who does the impossible - no, not bring peace to the Middle East - he manages to be unfunnier than Rob Schneider.",You Don't Mess with the Zohan

I do think that The Zohan is a hilarious film. Though it is very crude at times. It makes up for 2007's I now pronounce you Chuck and Larry. I think The Zohan character is really funny also.

63,jaredmobarak,"Hey, it's Sony gutsYou Don't Mess with the Zohan",3,3 June 2008,"What has happened to Adam Sandler? Billy Madison is one of my all-time favorite comedies, the romance-inclined Wedding Singer is fantastic, and his forays into serious farePunch-Drunk Love and Reign Over Mehave shown the talent hidden beneath the 5-year old trapped in a 40-year old body routine. As far as his production company's new work goes, in my opinion, a lot is left to be desired. Sadly, You Don't Mess with the Zohan does nothing to alleviate those feelings. Yes the trailer looked absolutely horrible, but I still held hope that something would click and give me an enjoyable experience once again. Don't get me wrong, I definitely laughed throughout, it's just that those laughs were more out of embarrassment for those on screen and because if I didn't chuckle at the asinine events, I would have needed to walk out from boredom. It appears that the Judd Apatow name means zilch when attached to a film he does not deem important enough to direct himself. This one is marginally better than Walk Hard, his last script helper, but not by much.The concept at hand has some potential. With an utterly preposterous sub-plot involving Sandler's Israeli Mossad agent faking his death in a fight with the leading Palestinean terrorist in the Middle East so that he can come to America and live his dream of being a hairstylist, you won't be thinking anything will be learned by watching. However, there are some moments that shed some criticism to the fight in the Middle East over land and religion as well as bringing up issues of compromise and acceptance for success in the US. As one Israeli says, he has just as hard a time fitting in as the Arabsbecause Americans confuse him as one. These two sides look similar, speak similar, and hold a large amount of national pride, containing a lot more in common than the war would like to admit. Leave it to Sandler and company to lambaste these moments with absurdity and broad humor, sending up the issue while also shining light on it although in a very dumbed down manner. Would I have liked more of this and less sexual innuendo? I don't really think it would have helped any.Right from the start we are shown what to expectphysical humor, sight gags, and obnoxiously drawn out sequences that start out funny yet finally fall flat. If the craziness leaves any mark it's the fact that Sandler got in pretty good shape for this role. Did he do so because of the script, or did he write it all to show off? Unnecessarily gratuitous shots of his backside, complete with fish and hacky sacks finding their way there, only made me hope that some real comedy was coming soon. Instead what we get is an abundance of Hummus, horrible fake accents (I need to believe these were purposely bad, especially Chris Rock's), and as many allusions to Sandler's Scrappy Coco satisfying the elderly clientele he cuts hair for as possible. There are some surprises, such as the truth to what is in his shorts as well as the plethora of cameos straight from left field (Dave Matthews?!), but for the most part, it is a completely obvious string of random events tied together with a thin plot line that really is secondary to the set-pieces and toilet humor.While the sex jokes got old really fasthow many times can he hump the women and spray water suggestively before our smiles turn to yawnsthe ethnic ones had a bit more life. Hummus as a universal food aside, I did find the random disco moments and Mariah Carey t-shirts humorous for the most part and the faulty Hezbollah phone line is priceless. Rob Schneider and John Turturro are over-the-top hams as always, actually a positive thing, never taking the roles seriously. Even Sandler, for what it's worth, plays the part well. The racial stereotypes definitely trump anything on display throughout; the writers involved holding nothing back and having no shame at all. And Emmanuelle Chriqui is absolutely gorgeous and likable, playing a similar role to her part on ""Entourage,"" with the addition of a bad accent.After all the headshaking and prayers for the film to either get better or just end, it is the supporting cast that leaves the only real indelible mark. The surprise cameos are just too many to mention and for the most part successful across the board. While the Zohan is a one-note joke beaten to death, those surrounding him attempt to infuse a little variety. Unfortunately the final result reminds me more of a recent Saturday Night Live skit, containing a funny premise and then killing it by not knowing when to stop while ahead. Even after seeing the foot fight in the trailers, the actual scene was still pretty hilarious. But what do the filmmakers do? Oh yes, they use the gimmick a few more times, including a sad, extended sequence in a fight scene at the end concerning new shoes, squeezing any laughter that might have still remained out way too early.",You Don't Mess with the Zohan
64,CitizenCaine,Don't Mess With The...Vulgarity Aplenty,6,5 July 2008,"Adam Sandler is back with another chaotic film, which is really another vulgarity fest for him. It's largely for an audience that doesn't worry about plot believability or the many misfired gags that are hallmarks of Adam Sandler's films. He plays a Mossad agent who just wants to get away from it all and...ah...make with the silky smooth and the big bang boom. In so doing, it gives Sandler and Director Dennis Dugan the opportunity to trot out all the Middle East stereotypes imaginable. This comes at a time when the United States is under permanent terrorist alert status. John Turturro is the Zohan's nemesis: The Phantom. The scorching hot Emmanuelle Chriqui plays the Palestinian hairdresser Sandler eventually works for and falls for. Lainie Kazan is hilarious as a stereotypical Jewish matron. Rob Schneider, a staple in Sandler's films, is almost unrecognizable but funny for once. Shelley Berman is Sandler's father. The host of cameos peppered throughout the film is always a sure sign the movie-makers do not have full confidence in a film's entertainment value, so like product placements, cameos are placed to distract the audience throughout. Charlotte Rae, Chris Rock, Mariah Carey, John McEnroe, George Takei, Bruce Vilanch, Dom Deluise, and Henry Winkler all have appearances. Sandler is at times equally funny as he is offensive.

66,jon.h.ochiai,Don't Mess Seeing the Zohan,6,18 June 2008,"""You Don't Mess with the Zohan"" starts off with a preposterous and hilarious premise: The greatest Israeli soldier Zohan (Adam Sandler) wants to hang it all up and become a hair stylist in New York City. Sandler's super Mossad agent Zohan is a cross between Jewish Rambo and James Bond. He possesses scary martial arts and Special Forces skills unlike any mere mortal. In the beginning we witness Zohan; dressed in Mariah Carey t-shirt and sandals, single handedly dispatch an entire squadron of Palestinian terrorists, in pursuit of deadly arch nemesis The Phantom (John Turturo). Admittedly, this is laugh out funny.Earlier in the story Zohan, who has grown weary of war, concedes to his parents, ""When does it end?"" He confesses to them his dream, ""I want to cut and style hair."" They laugh, and question their son's manhood. Well, despite the promising start, the failure of ""Don't Mess with the Zohan"" is that it has no end. Writers Sandler, Robert Smigel, and Judd Apatow are somehow missing the Third Act. Rather their feeble attempt at ""Why can't we all accept and live with one another?"" leads one to believe that they were at a loss for an ending. Midway through ""You Don't Mess with the Zohan"" is hysterical and crisply tasteless, probably crudely stereotyping the major Middle Eastern cultures. Not many can claim to do so. It is also a little puzzling that a lot of this Schick survived the editing room floor. Director Dennis Dugan infuses a puerile and infectious energy that runs on vapors half way through when the story is bankrupt of material.Sandler does his best to salvage this mess. He bulked up for comic action star role, and looks great including his dated Paul Mitchell style hairstyle. Despite his considerable charm and bold delivery, all is for not. ""You Don't Mess with the Zohan"" is a bunch of disjointed gags without a culminating punch line.In the story Zohan mysterious escapes to New York City to pursue his dream. However, he is thwarted by not actually having any real hairstylist training. Using his superior martial skills he rescues Michael (good dorky Nick Swardson). Michael and his Mom Gail (whacky Lainie Kazan) take in the wayward Zohan, who convincingly poses as an Australian. This is a nice ridiculous touch. Zohan hooks up with Palestinian salon owner Dalia (cute Emmanuelle Chriqui). Predictably Dalia becomes the Zohan love interest. However, the world's greatest counter terrorist soldier can not remain under the radar forever. What follows are a lot of hairstyling and the pursuit of peace among the Israeli and Palestinian cultures in New York Cityor not. The last half hour of ""You Don't Mess with the Zohan"" falls flat on its face, and is a complete mess. Don't mess with seeing ""The Zohan"". Personally, I would wait for the DVD.",You Don't Mess with the Zohan
67,carbuff,"I hate Adam Sandler, I loved this Movie",10,29 November 2020,"""You Don't Mess with the Zohan"" is crude, offensive, off-color, politically incorrect, arguably a bit sexist, somehow both cartoonishly and realistically violent, but ultimately heart-warming. It's got tons of fun cameos and nobody seems to be taking themselves very seriously or have any issues poking fun at themselves. Yeah, there's toilet humor from start to finish, so I wouldn't really call it a family movie. More accurately, the whole family might enjoy it, just not together.The ""Oh So Serious"" types who read ""The Economist"" and don't even realize that they are drowning in dry British wit are going to find this script way below their intellect while trivializing an ancient, tragic, and enduring conflict. Cultural and political warriors on the right and left are going to insist that this is inappropriate trash, especially if they have a strong (let's call it blinding) commitment to either Israel or Palestine. Personally, I feel they're the problem, not the solution, but they'll wrinkle their brows, condescendingly talk down to you about history they don't even know and human nature they don't understand, all the while furiously staking out ""The Moral High Ground"". If more people could see the humor and pathos in fictional works like this, not to mention in the reality of their own behavior, maybe there would be a lot less needless killing in the real world.So, while in general I hate Adam Sandler films, and the non-stop crudity in ""You Don't Mess with the Zohan"" is going to turn off a lot of uptight, humorless people, if more people could look past that, possibly we'd be less familiar with cruise missiles and suicide bombs.

68,Danusha_Goska,"Surprisingly Funny and Innovative, If You Ignore the Disgusting Parts",6,22 June 2008,"""You Don't Mess with the Zohan"" made me laugh out loud. Its best humor is something we've all been waiting for for a long time -- a genuinely funny putdown of Islamic extremism. Its worst humor is heavy-handed and often disgusting: endless attempts to wring humor from hummus and from Zohan's (Adam Sandler's) having sex with elderly women. The best version of this movie would be about a half hour shorter, after 90 % of the hummus jokes and 99% of the sex with old women jokes were removed from it.The movie is quite daring in spoofing Islamic extremism, but it falls back on bigotry against white, Southern males to solve its problems. Arabs aren't the bad guys, the movie insists. Jews aren't the bad guys. White Southern males are the bad guys. I hope that someday white Southerners, so often trashed by Hollywood, get their revenge.In spite of its flaws, this movie is worth seeing, because it is funny, and it is bold in its humor. Not many films out there feature jokes on Hizbollah.",You Don't Mess with the Zohan
69,jpschapira,A step backwards?,6,25 January 2009,"It may be very difficult to watch ""You don't mess with the Zohan"" if you don't like Adam Sandler. In fact, if you don't know much about what he does, you may think it's terribly bad. And that's not true, even when it's not very good either. As a fan of Sandler, in my opinion, this film is a step backwards; something typical but unexpected that, if analyzed properly, may inspire something more inspired next time around.A step backwards? Well, if we think about Sandler the actor, I have my doubts. A funny accent and movements, and the same old face and expressions the fans adore. He's making us laugh, sure; but there's no trace of the mature actor we saw in ""Spanglish"" and ""Punch-drunk Love"". Anyway, should there be? Remember there's also Sandler the producer, and he's an eternal child; watch ""Billy Madison"" if you don't believe me.I once said there were two Adam Sandlers. Well, for Sandler the producer this is a nice welcome. In full force, and without the indecision of the awful ""Click"", the man brings us a straight comedy that's conceived (and this needs to be understood) as an utter absurdity. The first scene shows the hero, Zohan (Sandler, of course) doing all sorts of impossible things as he's cheered by all sorts of people. He's the king in Israel, in some place where apparently a crown is given to the biggest buffoon, he's a 'superspy' (the details of this definition constitute some of the film's funniest moments) and he wants to fight no more and go to America to be a...Hairdresser. Imagine how his parents laugh at him.But it's alright if one or two people laugh at him; Zohan pays back making the audience laugh. In this minor absurdity, maybe the problem was that the producer aimed to high. It's fine to give cameos to Chris Rock, Mariah Carey, John McEnroe and the usual Kevin James, Henry Winkler, Kevin Nealon; it's fine to waste Emmanuelle Chriqui's (a beautiful woman that should have been a big star) talent giving her nothing to do as the love interest; it's fine to give-once again- Rob Schneider an unfunny role to play; it's fine to write the first screenplay in years, be smart enough to hire the smartest in the actual comedy business (Judd Apatow) and mess with anyone he can-as he did in ""Eight Crazy Nights""- as long as no one messes with his Zohan, as the title indicates.What's not fine is to abuse. To abuse of a tick that a character has; to abuse of a dance move he makes because he lives his life as if a giant music player laid above his head; to abuse of the political commentary (correct or not); to abuse of a funny image or moment. The trick of the repetition works, sometimes. It's funny once, maybe twiceBut three or more? Dennis Dugan's (who appears to have no personality and seems to be following higher orders) direction ends up being all that: an excess of abuse, an excess of repetition, an excess of excess.I always say that the audience shouldn't be fooled. In ""Click"" they made us believe different things when there was really nothing going on. ""Zohan"" is better, but they are also fooling us: Sandler is testing our patience, and I love him but this time I got tired.",You Don't Mess with the Zohan

71,jdkraus,A perfectly good waste of seven dollars...,3,17 June 2008,"I was never much of an Adam Sandler fan; however, I was impressed with his last two movies, ""Click"" and ""The Longest Yard"". Since I liked those two movies, I decided to see ""You Don't Mess With the Zohan"".Right off the bat, I'll say that this movie is very stupid. It has a lot of unrealistic slapstick humor during the corny fight sequences that remind of ""Kung Pow, Enter The Fist."" There are also many hysterical one-liners that poke fun of the Middle East, such as the ""Hezbollah hot line"" as well as the ridiculous Middle Eastern accents. But the majority of the humor came from inappropriate sex jokes and other innuendos that would orbit ""Family Guy"" and ""American Dad"" combined together.I did find myself laughing in this movie, but only out of discomfort from such humor. If I did not laugh, I was afraid to walk out of the theater, which I've only done on a few occasions. It wasn't creative that I was hoping for, in which the trailer built up as something looking worthwhile. Yet again, this film proves that 2-3 minute trailers are better than most feature length movies.Adam Sandler seemed to enjoy himself, as did his co-star John Tuturro, but those two could not save the movie. It was beyond repair because of poor scripting.

74,DonFishies,When did blatant racism become so funny?,2,8 March 2009,"What was it about Adam Sandler that has given this actor such staying power? Was it is knack of a sense of comedy in the early 1990s on SNL? Was it how physical and how immersed he became in his career making roles in Happy Gilmore and Billy Madison? What made this man a superstar? In You Don't Mess with the Zohan, Sandler plays the titular character Zohan Dvir. Zohan is part of an Israeli Special Forces team, and is praised like a God for his physical prowess and his uncanny ability of taking down Palestinian terrorists. But he secretly dreams of becoming a hair stylist in America. After another battle with famed terrorist The Phantom (John Turturro), Zohan fakes his death and heads to America in search of his dream.On paper, this sounds about as comedic as it does preposterous. In reality, it does not even border on preposterous. This may just be one of the absolute worst pieces of cinematic filth Sandler has ever contributed to. Ever since Big Daddy, the man's comedies have slowly descended from bad to worse, and Zohan does not even attempt to try and reconcile itself. With Judd Apatow's name in the credits, I thought we had some form of decent comedy coming our way. But I was very incorrect in thinking that.For Zohan follows in the mode of Sandler's I Now Pronounce You Chuck and Larry in that it tries to tackle a huge political issue. Where that was concerned with gay marriage and general acceptance of gays (while balancing forced anti and pro gay messages at the audience from beginning to end), this one deals with the very timely wars in the Middle East. But much the same, we get an unbalanced force feed of messages trying to inform us about a war the majority of the world understands already. But instead of using violent propaganda like The Kingdom, the filmmakers here use comedy to get their point across.But instead of being funny, this movie falls flat on its face. If it is not a blatantly racist joke about hummus or terrorists, it is a sex joke or even worse, a gay joke. Hell, the character of Zohan is so flamboyant that one wonders if Sandler forgot about Chuck and Larry entirely. Many of these jokes are beaten to death so viciously that it feels like the writers (Apatow, Robert Smigel and Sandler himself) felt hitting the same notes over and over again would help get the point across that what their characters are saying is funny. It is not funny guys, it stinks of one-note writing and borders on lunacy. Considering how well written (and not edited) The 40-Year-Old Virgin and Knocked Up were (and to a point, Walk Hard: The Dewey Cox Story), it is an absolute travesty to see Apatow's name in the credits. I weep for any other poor soul who views this movie hoping it will be good because Apatow had his hands involved. You may just lose hope in humanity if you do.Even worse is the excruciatingly painful acting. Turturro seems able to laugh and lampoon any sort of image he still has, but everyone else either looks out of place or is terrified they are even involved. Nick Swardson, the fourth billed actor in the credits, is reduced to mere painful reaction shots and poop jokes. Rob Schnieder plays the same fiddle as always, in a role as another ethnic stereotype behind a layer of makeup. He is about as funny as the real life subject matter the film attempts to make light of. And of course, the Sandler cameo cast shows up as always, with Henry Winkler showing up and being made an ass of, Kevin James showing up and acting silly, and Chris Rock in a tiny blink-and-you'll-miss-it role, which turns out to actually be one of the funniest things in the film.Emmanuelle Chriqui, a talented actress, is thrown into her role as Zohan's love interest, and she looks positively terrified in the role. She plays the straight edge to Sandler's loopiness, but her part is so simplified and narrow that she gets nearly no time to do anything with the role besides look pretty and whine at designated points. Her chemistry with Sandler is DOA from the start, and never once is it believable for either of these characters to have any interest at all in each other. She looks about as delighted to sleep or kiss him as she does locking him away in a padded cell. She is a glorified extra, and it angers me to no end that the film wallows away so easily on throw-away jokes about the Zohan's penis and Hezbollah terrorist hotlines, and gives a top-billed actress like Chriqui the status of simply looking gorgeous and saying next to nothing.Sandler himself is the single worst thing about the movie. He revels in its awful jokes, and actually ruins any of the ones that could have been remotely funny. He just does not seem to know when to say when, and he frequently loses any steam he builds for himself. He may look like he is enjoying himself, but there is little reason for him to be here other than to collect a paycheck. He did such fabulous work in Punch Drunk Love and Reign Over Me, did he simply forget about these movies too? The man has become a predictable parody of himself, and has begun to dry up as a comedian. If he just plans on continuing with the same schtick movie after movie until the entire audience begins to realize what a hack he has become, he is in for some trouble in the days ahead.Let's just hope Funny People is another movie where Sandler attempts to redeem himself, and not one where audience members are better off searching for rusty spoons than watching the movie.2/10.",You Don't Mess with the Zohan
75,griffolyon12,"So Bad, That It Is Often Entertaining!",4,7 June 2008,"You Don't Mess With the Zohan is yet another Adam Sandler movie. Now I will start first by saying that I am not an Adam Sandler fan, I never have been, I just don't find his brand of comedy funny. With that said, on with my critique.Zohan is a movie about an Israeli counter terrorist named the Zohan. The Zohan is almost a superhero when it comes to strength and invulnerability, and is the top assassin for the Israelis; of course the Zohan has a secret ambition, to move to America and cut hair. After faking his death and getting a new hairstyle, the Zohan comes to New York City and pursues his dream of hairstyling.I must say that this movie delivered everything I expected it to, a movie that was so bad in production values and so ridiculously stupid that you couldn't help laughing at it at times. The main problem with this movie was that none of the jokes that got a chuckle out of me were very lasting, they were just cheap laughs playing off of sexual references and other stuff, but none of the jokes were funny enough to truly make a lasting impression. Another problem with the movie was that the movie played too much off of ethnic and racial stereotypes at times trying to be funny, and it often came off as rude and inconsiderate. Overall it was what I expected from Sandler, a movie with thousands of sexual innuendos and racial jokes that were either not funny, or not original enough to make me want to give the movie a second go. Just like I've said about many similar movies, this might have worked better as a short SNL skit as opposed to a 2 hour movie, but 2 hours of cheap sex and race jokes is just too long for me.I give this movie a 4 out of 10!",You Don't Mess with the Zohan
76,LazySod,"Not bad, not good.",5,3 September 2008,"Zohan is an Israeli secret agent. Fed up with having to fight the Palestinians every day he decides to en scene his own death so that he can escape to the USA and live out his dreams. The problem with escapes like this is that one day the past will come back for a proper haunting. And so it is for the Zohan.The most films with Adam Sandler have one thing in common: they don't put too much pressure on the mind (if at all). This one falls into that same category. It gets its comedy value from playing around common prejudice and it has a number of moments that are pretty good. Unfortunately these moments are far apart and the time between them is filled with rather sequences that are flat and dull. All in all, it would have made a good 15 minute clip but that just won't do for a film.5 out of 10 haircuts brutalized",You Don't Mess with the Zohan

I've seen him go through many phases, from some great films like 'Punch-Drunk Love,' 'Reign Over Me,' and 'Big Daddy' to some of his lower-end films like 'Eight Crazy Nights' and 'Little Nicky.' 'You Don't Mess With the Zohan' is not one of his best films, but it's still enjoyable. Personally, I'd place it along the comedic quality of 'Billy Madison'. . . contains mostly sight gags and juvenile humour. But, c'mon. . . sometimes that's what we need. Our world is going to Hell, so shouldn't we have some relief from the pain and torment we must witness on a daily basis? No. It's not a great film. But it's funny and stupid and entertaining. And that's the reason to see it. . . don't expect a comedic masterpiece like 'His Girl Friday' or 'Forrest Gump.'

Adam Sandler may not be at Billy Madison or Happy Gilmore status anymore, but he still is reliable for a very cheap laugh at best. The whole concept for this movie is sort of a fresh concept for a Happy Madison movie. So honestly if you are a big fan of Adam Sandler, then you want to consider checking this one out.

82,diac228,"Hello Good Concept, meet Sandler, in need of a career makeover, Script, in need of a better stylist.",5,10 June 2008,"Take a handful of cameos, a handful of plots mingling together, several sex jokes up the ying yang, more crotch shots than a porno, surprising amount of political and social humor, a terrible ending, and a handful of unnecessary fluff, and you'll have You Don't Mess With the Zohan. The movie could have been something special, could have been something different, and could have really delivered a message about a situation that few Americans know about. But, with Adam Sandler and a terrible director behind the wheel they manage to rip off all potential by sending the film in many different directionsand none of them reaching a proper ending point. The fact that Judd Apatow was involved with the writing was its selling point, as it was offering an Adam Sandler vehicle that is unlike anything we've seen. Instead, it looks like a movie that we've definitely seen before.Zohan is an Israeli fighter getting sick of the war, and stages a fake death so he can travel to the United States to become a hairdresser. However, as he adjusts to life in the Big Apple, the past starts catching up to him. The plot alone sparks interest, but leave it to Sandler to mess with a unique concept by adding his hit-and-mostly-miss humor and several subplots that extends the running time past 110 minutes. The massive amount of political and social undertones is quickly erased by the plethora of sex jokes that become a bit tiring by the third act. One would wonder how different the movie would have been if they hadn't tried so hard to keep it from rated ""R."" One would also wonder how much Apatow actually dedicated to the script, since it's rather weak by his standards.For some odd reason, an Adam Sandler movie actually has decent acting. Sandler does wonders to create a laugh, he goes quite far this time around. The rest of the cast is actually quite good, including John Turturro, Emmanuelle Chriqui, Dave Matthews (wait..what?), and even Rob Schneider (Yes, I actually said this). The movie blends physical humor with gross-out humor, sex humor, political humor, and random humor. However, its biggest strength becomes its biggest flaw. The movie will make you laugh, no doubt about it, but Zohan is a film that goes in many different directions like a confused tourist, not quite knowing where to go. Instead of veering in one direction, the movie goes everywhere and becomes a convulsed mess, especially towards the end.Example: the first act of the movie is definitely different from the third act. The first twenty minutes showcases the crazy lifestyle of Zohan, his abilities to break the laws of physics; resulting in some hilarity. By the third act, almost all humor has been replaced with endless cameos, and a very sugar-coated message. The director Dennis Dugan has no idea what to with the concept that has a lot of uniqueness and social criticism undertones, playing with it like a child and makes it appeal only to immature people. He was risky with the risqué sex jokes that dangled with the PG-13/R border, yet plays it totally safe when dealing with the Israeli/Palestinian conflict. Instead of pulling off a ""Three Kings,"" he pulls off a ""Deuce Biggalo,"" except it's much funnier than Deucebut with the same amount of embarrassing distaste. Sometimes you'll laugh then be totally ashamed because you were laughing.Perhaps the funniest thing about Zohan is how all the humor that hits and clicks is used the least. His antics in the hair salons across New York and when fighting are the best, but they don't last that long. Another interesting note is the immense amount of New York humor that went over the heads of most of the audience. You need a profound knowledge of New York City to catch all the jokes. The ""G.O.O.B."" store will not tickle your funnybone as much unless you've been to the Big Apple.Bottom Line: Another potentially great flick ruined because they were in the wrong hands. One would wonder what would've happened if Apatow and Sandler sent this to another director, or had another actor portray the hero altogether. When Zohan is n full-blast, he is a hoot. When other subplots try to cash in on the laughs, or when cameos flood the screen, or when a message is trying to be delivered, Zohan is a snooze. The movie could have been shorter, could have been edgier, and could have lacked the Adam Sandler clichés in order to be better overall. Instead, we have the typical Sandler flick with a different cast of characters, the same setting, and a new lesson to be learned. The actual lesson is: Stop watching Sandler movies because his best work is way behind him.",You Don't Mess with the Zohan
83,tastyhotdogs,Awful,2,31 October 2008,"""You Don't Mess With The Zohan"" is a fictional story about Israeli assassin Zohan (Sandler) who longs to quit his demanding job and move to the US to become a hairdresser. To do so he fakes his death and boards a plane with a couple of dogs. Once he lands in the US he searches for his dream job, starting at the top salon but after being laughed off the premises, eventually settles for a dumpy small salon. When a hair stylist quits, Zohan gets his chance. He soon becomes renowned for giving great old lady haircuts, which include certain ""favours"". Things aren't all smooth though as Zohan must deal with racial issues, falling for a Palestinian and being recognised by some countymen.Just an awful, awful movie. Besides the awful storyline and having more penil jokes than even Mike Myers would dream of, it semi-attempted to touch on the Middle Eastern situation.

86,Ddey65,Much too disco-disco for me.,4,12 December 2013,"***SPOILER ALERT*** Adam Sandler plays Zohan Dvir, a Mosaad agent with almost super-human strength and abilities, but the movie fails to explain why Zohan is so ""super-human."" It doesn't mention his excessive training in Israeli martial arts such as Kapap and/or Krav Maga, which it's supposed to exaggerate. He also has some decent replies to the Palestinian terrorists who keep shouting their usual rhetoric while attacking him. But Zohan is tired of the violence between Israelis and Palestinians. One reason is the frequent prisoner exchanges which keep the violence going, and another is his desire to become a hair stylist. So, he fakes his death during a battle with a high-profile Palestinian terrorist(played by John Tutturro), and sneaks on a cargo plane to New York City.What Zohan finds about America is that Arabs and Jews can work on the same block. This is the idea behind the melting pot that we pride ourselves on being. He later gets a job on that block as a hairdresser at a salon run by a cute Palestinian woman, played by Emmanuelle Chriqui and becomes a sensation when he has sexual trysts with old ladies. All the while the block is facing the threat of being torn down by a developer, who keeps jacking up the leases on the buildings, and when this fails tries to inflame tensions between the two groups, by getting some neo-Nazis to pose as both Jews and Arabs.While the advocacy of peace between Israelis and Palestinians is admirable, it doesn't make the movie so great. ""A"" from Israel is certainly right about the causes of violence between Israelis and Palestinians, but he's wrong about the origins of the latter of the two groups. Beisdes that the end result was still neighborhood redevelopment, even if it wasn't the kind that the ""villain"" of the movie wanted. And then, of course, there's that rampant disco soundtrack. Ugh!

87,gary-444,Lots of off-beat fun,8,18 August 2008,"Do not be put off by some of the carping criticism that this film has received. It is very funny, made me laugh out loud, and dares to touch on some areas of humour which are traditionally taboo, especially in American cinema. I am not a particular Adam Sandler fan, and have only seen ""Happy Gilmore"" of his previous work. But I was highly entertained by some genuinely amusing set pieces, and his exploration of humour in very dangerous territory.The plot line is simple enough. Zohan, the uber counter terrorist Mossad agent, decides to hang up his Uzi for a pair of hairdressers scissors in New York. But the past is never far behind The opening scenes which establish his credentials as a super agent are funny, fast paced and engaging with plenty of wry self deprecating put downs including his parents begging him to ""play safe"" in his present job. After faking his death at the hands of his arch rival, the Phantom played by John Turrito, he then resurfaces in New York.At this point two things are worth mentioning. Firstly Turrito plays the Phantom for laughs, which ironically drains some of the humour. A straight ""bad guy"" would have been funnier. Secondly the ""second act"" is primarily made up of crude, sexual innuendo which is wholly inappropriate for an audience that can get into a UK 12A certification. It is very funny, and there are plenty of laughs to be had from a youngish hairdresser with no hairdressing skills acquiring superstar status by ""banging old ladies with big tits"". But it is miles away from the humour of the trailer and the first fifteen minutes.The part of Zohan appears to have been inspired by Sasha Cohen's ""Borat"", but Sandler insists that his idea for this film pre-dates Borat. It certainly shares the same mad cap humour. The two calls to the ""Hezbolah helpline"" are wonderful vignettes. However the heavy hand of Hollywood is never far away and Zohan's romance with the astonishingly beautiful Palestinian hairdresser boss Dalia. played by Emmanuelle Chirqui, is played for feel good value, rather than the devilment it could have been. Equally the artificial introduction of a greedy property developer and White Ayrian Supremacists are artificial ,and a device to move the ""villainy"" around. The cameo appearances by Mariah Carey and John McCenroe are extraordinary for them being totally unnecessary.A denouement with a message that we should all just get on together is a bit too sugary for my tastes, and plays to American sensibilities. Nonetheless this is a brave attempt at satire, and for the most part comes off. Possibly twenty minutes too long, a ""harder"" story stripped of the saccharine ending would have been stronger. Still well worth a look though.",You Don't Mess with the Zohan

It is the typical Adam Sandler comedy that includes beautiful women, sexual humor and a clumsy but lucky guy that tries to be a different or better person The cast is very good beginning with Adam Sandler that although his performance is a little exaggerated, he manages to make it funny.

John Turturro as the Phantom is also very good, Emmanuelle Chriqui with a decent performance as a sweet Palestinian girl who owns a beauty saloon and a brief but convincing appearance by Chris Rock as a Jamaican cab driver.

I do not feel there is anything politically insulating about the movie but the problem is that is just not very funny and, as I have all ready described, the plot breaks down around half ways into the movie. It is a bit difficult to understand that this movie has gotten such a relatively high rating here.

From John Turturro as the Phantom who has his own Arabic version of Rocky and constant screaming and yelling out sharmoota or manyakkk, Rob Schneider's role as the guy who misses his goat to the small cameo of Chris Rock as the eerie Jamaican cab driver at the start of the flick and to all the old ladies who love getting their hair cut and feel like they are in their 20s - just shows how the surrounding cast do almost everything in their power to make a joke out of something and the film is literally an open invite to just laugh. Sandler's Everlong hair where it says ""I care the way I look but I'm still approachable"" is exactly what this flick is. Yes it has its political views on the long last fight between two nations in the Middle East who if only paid attention to this film would see the best way to get along is disco disco or to play hacky sack.

As Zohan sets about fulfilling his ambition of being a hairdresser, the age-old politics of misunderstanding between the Israelis and the Palestinians caught up with him in lower Manhattan and the greediness of a corporate magnate in Grant Walbridge (Michael Buffer).It is always never easy to tackle an issue as delicate as what is in the film. It stays clear of the stereotypes, as it showed how the Israelis and the Palestinians came together when Grant Walbridge was trying to fulfil his ambition of trying to build a mall in the area where the Middle East Americans reside, apart from Zohan himself.

That time where people bash Adam Sandler, and nobody really listens. They go to the theater even though the critics are less than generous, and more often than not, the audience will have a good time. The same is true of his latest film, You Don't Mess With the Zohan. Stock full of celebrity cameos and Sandler regulars, not to mention crude body jokes, and some satire of Middle Eastern stereotypes, this film is not too bad, and could be considered in the second tier of Sandler's work.Sandler's turn this time is something you wouldn't expect from him. It's not your typical fare from him, but there are a lot of jokes you DO expect him to do. Though the film isn't comic genius by any means, there's no doubt that you'll love Zohan as a character, no matter how creepy he gets. The film is as likable as any of Sandler's past work, meaning it'll be a hit for him. He continues to display why he's one of the country's favorite stars, as he's been doing for the past 15 years. I like to describe Sandler's films as that kind of friend that you don't see more than once or twice every few years, but when that friend's in town, you're going to have a blast.You've got your typical toilet humor jokes here, and that's really about it. There's some stereotype jokes in addition to some slapstick stuff, and that's really the whole movie. Unfortunately, I don't see this film doing as well at the box office as other Sandler films have, as this is not a child friendly movie. Parents be warned, there are TONS of sexual jokes, and well over 10 unseen, yet implied sex scenes. And lots of references to the genitals.At its worst, Zohan is a silly, stupid, typical Adam Sandler movie. But at its best, the film is a likable, silly, hilarious, and fun comedy that most can enjoy. It's easy to access, and won't be disappointing, because you know what you're going to see when you enter the theater.

97,shadowman123,You don't mess with a crap movie!,4,8 September 2008,"When I was in my adolescence growing up , films from Adam Sandler were worth a watch because my brain found that type humour well amusing however now that I am that little bit wiser I have also seen the sudden lapse in his behaviour and how unfunny he is. I mean the last Adam Sandler movie I saw was the Longest Yard and that it-self was a very good movie however You Don't mess with Zohan is not! First of it is riddled with so many stereo-types that they are not funny even to a 14 year old who will say that it is lame. On the surface it might appear to be funny but however in truth there is very little humour and although the moral is that no matter what our background we are all humans, the fact is that it deals with a very sensitive issue that is too close to some people to exploit, it comes no surprise to me that someone as wretched as Adam Sandler would use this as a come back aimed at his pro-Zionist and Isreali friends.

Then again, maybe not. Judging by how this piece of cinematic entertainment opens with the hero making on the beach like a hipper-than-thou Jesus, butts, gays, penises, defecation, boobs, rednecks, hummus, and Mel Gibson are the least of Sandler's hang-ups!Has anyone else noticed that this retard always follows up a serious film with a pile of dung, just like that other obnoxious bastard child of Lorne Michaels, Will Ferrell, lest either be accused of having any actual talent?

The film starts off fun and finishes even more so. The film throughout is simply hilarious and even now, some bits are making me pause and chuckle (Not in the crazy way) and the film made me question why in hell some people hated this movie. The movie may not have been great, it was stupid and obnoxious but it was meant to be. It was really, really funny most of the time, and even Kevin James's very small cameo brought another aspect to the humour of the film. The film was also helped out by the roles of parents, friends and the people who he cuts the hair off.Overall, I think this film is worth a watch for anyone who enjoys a laugh and a good excuse of a movie for 110 minutes. I am glad there are still SOME good comedies coming out this year.",You Don't Mess with the Zohan
100,ssvikas,"Lewd Comedy! Lose your logic, sit back and enjoy the ride!",6,24 September 2008,"If it is Adam Sandler, it has to be at least a good comedy. This one is surely enjoyable, but be prepared to take in a big dose of lewd humor thrown into the movie in a great measure at every possible opportunity. In a departure from the good-boy comedy in 50 first dates or a helpless hubby in Anger Management, this time, Sandler plays Zohan, an Israeli Counterterrorist with an unshakable penchant for hair, women and Humus. Zohan is the perfect weapon that any army would be proud to possess. Blessed with near invulnerability, don’t ask me how, and skills to juggle stuff, jump buildings and even tolerate a piranha in his pants! But, in his heart, it is not war that he wants, but to cut and style hair! While on a mission to capture his arch-enemy and nearly equally skilled phantom, Zohan fakes his death and heads to America to live his hairdresser dream. Taking on the name Scrappy Coco, derived from the names of two dogs in whose box he travels to America, he tries in futility to find a job at leading salons. Ambling on the road, he bumps into a boy, saves the latter from road rage and gains a living space, thanks to the boy’s mother taking an insatiable interest in Zohan. Yes, you read it right! But that’s just one of the many women that Zohan goes on to satisfy though the film! Soon, he lands a job in a small salon run by a Palestinian Dahlia (Emmanuelle Chriqui) in a locality where Israelis and Palestinian Arabs ran sundry shops. Skeptical at first to hand Zohan the scissors, Dahlia soon finds her salon become a runaway hit, thanks to the invulnerable weirdo tagging in a quickie for the old women in the back room. It goes without saying that our hero soon falls for the irresistibly pretty Dahlia, who likes him too.The movie prompts a funny way of solving the middle-eastern conflict when the Phantom who later lands in America following his passion to sell shoes, and our hero join hands to save their natives’ shacks from a local land-shark. The story is predictable, but the humor keeps it going! For the lead, Sandler, also one of the movie’s writers is at his best again. Chriqui a Canadian actress, actually Israeli by descent is a desirable eye candy!So, if you are one of those who cringe at a comic of virile macho male star romancing old women while giving them a haircut or a shampoo, I suggest you keep away Zohan. As with the majority, if you don’t mind leaving your brains and logic in the refrigerator back home, you are in for a lot of funnies, sometimes weird though, that would leave you rolling on the floor asking for more. Adam Sandler, you’re a killer with comedy!",You Don't Mess with the Zohan

Its sure to get some bad publicity for being just a little bit racist. It was hard not to think of Borat when Adam Sandler is saying 'nice' and having 'sexy time' with old ladies.This is a movie to rent not to see in cinemas. Save your money for something good. This movie is not meant to be taking seriously. But it is hard not to when we are watching Adam Sandlers genitals dance. I did think of leaving the cinema but chose to stay in case i missed something. Sadly all i got was a few laughs,a OK performance from Sandler as Zohan and funny scenes from Nick Swardson.I don't recommend this. There's one thing this is though. It is the best hairdressing movie ever. I know this will make quite a lot of money but it better do it before The Dark Knight comes to your town.

102,jemps918,Silky smooth!,6,3 August 2008,"Safe Sandler fare served with the usual hefty portions of politically incorrect humor reminiscent of Borat.Adam Sandler is Zohan Dvir, an Israeli counter-terrorist who hides out in New York to pursue his passion: hairdressing. Of course his loyal standbys like Rob Schneider have bit parts, but the lady love of the moment is Emmanuelle Chriqui who plays Dalia, the Palestinian owner of the small-town hair salon where Zohan works.It's still the shock-value stuff v. few actors can get away with and Sandler and veteran comedy director Dennis Dugan takes full advantage of it. Judd Apatow helps in the writing in Zohan, too. The staple good moral story that is usually the underlying thread in movies in this genre is present in Zohan, too, and in this case it's can't we all just get along?/unity in diversity.While it's always nice that this formula of brash comedy laced with a satiric commentary still sells, some variations to liven up the jokes (which can get tired) would be better appreciated by loyal Sandler/Dugan fans. Yes, we love the ridiculous humor and are grateful for the preachy attacks on social ills, but I believe we are ready for better writing now.",You Don't Mess with the Zohan

Sure, it's not a spectacular comedic adventure movie, but it's still more than halfway decent.",You Don't Mess with the Zohan
104,mr_popcorn,"McCheesy's take on ""You Don't Mess with the Zohan""",4,30 July 2008,"Yet another stupid film from the Adam Sandler shingle Happy Madison. This is like the umpteenth time the guy disappointed the fans, including me. Their previous work, Chuck & Larry was controversial yes, but in the area of making people laugh, they either tried too hard or it wasn't funny at all. This time however, the ridiculousness reaches its maximum level when Zohan starts punching some dude with his feet. To be honest, its not funny. Sorry Adam, your ""Feeet Happerkat"" didn't work.There were some funny moments but it's on microscopic level. I would have to say the stereo-typing of the Americans to the Jews and the Arabs and other foreigners is the foundation of almost all the jokes. You will laugh at some of them, but mostly, you will not. The male genitalia in-jokes was not funny by one bit.Regular castmates Rob Schneider, Nick Swardson, Henry Winkler and Kevin Nealon was present but their presence is zero visibility. Meaning they were there physically but they're not there when it comes to making the audience laugh.""You Don't Mess with The Zohan"" is a second miss for Adam Sandler's crew.

If ONLY Israel and the Mid East could really come and live together as neighbors and fellow workers as I see here in Los Angeles. Sandler is so amusing as Zohan and his physical stunts are wonderful and very clever. The film moves at a fast pace and the humor is often laugh out loud funny. In a summer of 2008 filled with ""car chases, explosions, and wooden acting"", ZOHAN hits the spot as an entertaining film, but with the reality of the issues in the Middle East and the advance of ""corporatism"" into our neighborhoods and jobs. Adam Sandler, like Will Smith, is an actor who can deliver the goods, and produce big box office, with solid entertainment.",You Don't Mess with the Zohan
106,Siamois,Typical Sandler...,5,6 September 2008,"A lot of reviews here have said it: this is a Sandler movie, much similar to the usual Happy Madison (the production company) standards. Your usual appreciation of those releases will dictate what you should expect. If you're the type of person who finds these movies hilarious, rush out and see this. If you find them unbearable, avoid this one. If like me, you think Happy Madison movies are OK and a mixed bag, the rest of this review is for you:This is a weaker than average Happy Madison movie. The topic and plot line offered a lot of opportunities but at times, it drags a little. Gross humor can be cool but here, it rarely is. Acting:Sandler is his usual self. He's funny at times but he's been better. Turturro is a downer here. In Anger Management, his performance was golden. Here, it's uninspired and he doesn't have much material to work with. Schneider is OK. Doing his usual shtick. Emmanuelle Chriqui is just Eye Candy. There's not much chemistry between her and Sandler, unfortunately. And none of her scenes are remotely funny. The plot is dumb, but who really cares? This is a by-the-number comedy with the usual resolution you expect in a Happy Madison movie. Overall, I think Happy Madison releases since 2004 have been on the decline. They're not awful if you like that type of humor but it's really become repetitive and stale to me.",You Don't Mess with the Zohan
107,stevepat99,Only Sandler FANS need apply,2,8 June 2008,"Reading reviews on this one is USELESS. With that said here's my two cents. You need know only one thing....Zohan is neither 50 First Dates nor Wedding Singer class. It is the usual Sandler 'class' film which means toilet humor reigns supreme. Show crotch close-ups of Sandler's extra huge man 'tool,' Sandler post coitus with an 80 year old, viewing close-ups of his bare ass, licking an old woman's hair etc. etc. and his fans are rolling in the aisles. How one reviewer admits seeing the film, walking out and then requesting a refund is remarkable. Hopefully the request was denied by applying the 'you know Sandler...you got Sandler"" principle. Those who LOVE Sandler's usual low brow, body parts/toilet ridden, bad taste humor love Zohan and likely walked out on 50 First Dates and Wedding Singer.

108,The_Orenda,It could be worse.,6,29 June 2008,"Sandler's latest comedy effort could be worse, but honestly, it's not that bad. If you look at the film from an artistic standpoint, Zohan stinks on all counts. The screenplay is a mess, the jokes are up and down, the accents are hard on the ears and Mariah Carey is undeniably out of place in this film. But the film is still funny at points and that's all you would hope from a comedy. What throws most people off I believe is the inevitable confrontation between the Palestinians and Israelis.Two-thirds through the film Zohan stops cutting hair and making older women swoon as Palestinians descend upon him, mainly due to a chance encounter with one Salim, whose goat was stolen by Sandler's character at one point. This sub-plot break in the action, where the Israelis and Palestinians team up to find the Walbridge Corp. responsible for jacking up the rent and littering hate crimes across the neighborhood, is not really funny, despite the script's and actors' best efforts. But the movie is not really that bad, as it's good for maybe a one-time viewing. Hummus, hacky-sack and disco jokes can only last so good for so long, and if Sandler can still act now, he'll still find ways to make people laugh.",You Don't Mess with the Zohan
109,Ozzy2000,A great chuckle,10,25 June 2008,"Adam Sandler somehow succeeds in bring us another hilarious comedy. I confess his humour in this film is a bit crude and outrageously yucky but still its was very funny and the whole audience was drawn into the silly humour and had a great belly laugh.Adam plays a disillusioned but much loved Israeli Mossad Hero Zohan who secretly harbours a desire to be a great fashion hairdresser. The israeli government sends him on a mission to ""take out"" his arch rival Palestinian terrorist ""The Phantom"" played by John Turturro. After scenes of barbecue fish grilling with special buttock serving acrobatics Zohan throws himself into battle with the Phantom.Zohan uses this battle to fake his own death and smuggles himself to New York. The phantom becomes a cult hero in Palestine and opens a ""Falafel"" franchise of takeaway stores.Zohan quickly discovers that his early eighties Hair styling and body politic is making him the object of ridicule. His adulating Israeli friends who all work in the traditional American role as Cheap electronics retailing try to assist Zohan achieve his dreams.They get him a job as an assistant hairdresser in a salon run by a beautiful Palestinian women. The Phantom discovers Zohan is still alive and well in New York and the final showdown is set.A wonderful satire about the tragic Middle Eastern conflict that reveals what is often very true that Israelis and Palestinians often have so much in common when they desert the Middle Eastern horrors when finding a new life in America.I think that the film has a positive message for older women disguised in Zohan's fetishes that are revealed in his struggle to become a great stylist.The Humus and humour gush freely in this schmaltzy little Jewish flavoured film and its worth seeing.I am not a great fan of Sandler but he is slowly winning me over with his silly humour and memorable films.",You Don't Mess with the Zohan

Oh sure, when they're well done you practically need to carry me out of the theater in an oxygen tent, but far too often they're mediocre, with a few chuckles sprinkled here and there, and basically not worthy of making the trek to the cineplex and shelling out the bucks. Typically DVD is a far more accommodating medium for the genre. So it's somewhat of a surprise to say that Adam Sandler's You Don't Mess with the Zohan had me in stitches through most of it  a good sign because Sandler's usual style of comedic hi-jinks have typically been more miss than hit.Telling the delightfully loopy story of an almost super-human Israeli Mossad agent who stages his death at the hands of Palestinian arch nemesis The Phantom (John Turturro) so he can move to New York City and pursue his dream of becoming a hair stylist, Sandler, along with writers Robert Smigel (Saturday Night Live) and Judd Apatow (40 Year Old Virgin, Knocked Up, Superbad) have wisely opted to mine the Zucker brothers' vein of comedy with the end result being a movie that is chock full of stupidly funny scenes. There's even a running gag about Hummus that's almost worth the price of admission alone. I should also mention that in addition to the laughs, the movie also comes with some incredible eye-candy in the form of Montreal-born Emmanuelle Chriqui, who plays Dalia, the stunningly attractive Palestinian hair salon owner who gives Zohan his big break upon his arrival in New York. Consider that to be the sprinkles on an already tasty ice cream.On paper, I could see the premise of this movie making some producers cringe. And yet it manages to take the touchy topic of the conflict in the Middle East and turn it on its head for some laugh-out-loud moments. Add to that the fact that the movie has its heart in the right place, and this is a comedy that won't steer you wrong.",You Don't Mess with the Zohan
113,Lomedin,I used to like Adam Sandler,1,16 May 2012,"I was a fan of Sandler back in the days of Happy Gilmore, Little Nicky and even Click. However, it seems that Sandler is getting worse and worse lately. Particularly in movies he's involved with as a writer. This leads me to think that he has become a terrible person ideas-wise. Of course, it's not all his fault. Take Bedtime Stories. That movie is also quite bad and he didn't write it. Anyway, I'm in shock after learning that there's going to be a Grown Ups 2. Brrr. But let's keep to this movie, shall we? Simply put, this movie could have been written by a 12 years old boy. Granted, the special effects are very good. That's all. The jokes are bland, insulting, overused and basically horrible. The plot made me want to rip my face off. I hardly understood what Sandler said throughout the whole film due to his fake Israeli accent. The whole racist views and the predictable turn of it into some sort of emotional humanist excuse for such an act made me sick. Alright, I was not expecting a masterpiece here, but c'mon. And the animals. That's something to mention. For some reason, it seems like Sandler's movies in the past years make a point about how funny it is to mistreat animals. What the...!!! I watched Tropic Thunder right after this and that's a film you can have a good time with, in all levels. Ben Stiller. Now, that is a man who reached the expectations all the time. As an actor and director. It's like a different level. Zohan is like a bad cartoon for kids. Tropic Thunder is silly humor well directed for adults. I hope you get the point.Sandler, stop putting your friends in all your (unfunny) movies. Try, perhaps, casting some good actors like Stiller does and change your ideas.

115,robertallenandersonjr,A great comedy movie for the summer of 2008,8,6 June 2008,"You Don't Mess With The Zohan was very funny but at the same time extremely Corny. It had it's very funny moments and then weird moments. For the most part I enjoyed it and was happy with it. I think Adam Sandler is very funny and did a great job. The lead actress did a pretty good job. She sometimes seemed to have an accent and then not at different scenes. So she could've don't a better job in some scenes. Their was a little bit of action to go along with it as well. It had many different types of comedy. It had raunchy parts, racist parts, and many more. The movie was not trying to be racist which some people might think. In my opinion the movie was explaining some good things about different race. The messages were great and talking about how other ethnic backgrounds can all get along. Their was a tiny bit of romance which you see in the trailer though. For some people they might not like it because it's to Corny or to weird or was to raunchy. Other people might think it was very funny and was done in great taste. For the most part it will probably get mixed reviews which I seem to have been hearing. I think it was great comedy movie for the summer and will be one of the funniest. When you go to see this movie though just know it is very far-fetched and mostly all the stuff Adam Sandler does in this movie is not real or believable at all. Such as some of the things he does is catch a bullet with his nose and blow it out, and another was play hacky sack with a cat. The story was kind of all over the place. It starts off with him being a terrorist and then trying to become his dream job. Then a couple people trying to bring him back to Iraq. So the story kind of jumped and didn't stay in one spot. One more thing I will add was it was funny throughout the whole movie and was laugh out loud. Overall though the movie was very good but did have many flaws.

Now, not all movies have to be groundbreaking, but the best ones are. Second, this movie is stupid and unfunny. Now, I've seen comedies that are stupid , like I Now Pronounce You Chuck and Larry, but at least that was funny. This isn't. It has a few choice cameos, but I really didn't care for any of them except Henry Winkler, so I couldn't really anticipate any of the guest appearances. Also, the oh-so-long running length of 113 minutes(I think). I had given up on this movie after the first hour or so, but it just kept going and going! It was fun to make fun of it for awhile, but then it just got depressing. For the viewers sanity, movies like these really shouldn't be longer than 90 minutes. Now, I knew this was going to be stupid, so I didn't bother to spend money to rent it. I just checked it out from the library. But it was even worse than I expected. This film might be good for prepubescent children who can easily laugh at bare butts... but for anyone over the age of 12, this is not the movie for you.

118,the_Poppuns,He'll save every one of us,8,8 June 2008,"'Don't Mess With the Zohan' was nothing like I thought it would be. I was expecting a zany comedy. And again, like 'Forgetting Sarah Marshall', we have a comedy that's not really about being funny. I think Adam Sandler movies usually have something serious to them but this was all about the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. I'm not kidding. In reality this is a message movie. That's what I meant about him saving us. His methods of making everyone silky smooth, and hacky sack tournaments with breaks for disco time may seem a little far-fetched, but if 'Rocky IV' could bring down the Iron Curtain, I don't see why this can't solve the problems in the Middle East.If you're the kind of person who wants a droll comedy full of witty dialogue and sarcastic in-jokes, this isn't for you. This one is for those looking for the rainbow connection. It's silly, insanely silly. But it's got loads of heart. It's about not judging other people and working together to defeat real evil. It's a little like 'Undercover Brother' in that way.The cameos were great. Adam always has the best soundtracks in his movies and that's no different here. I can imagine a lot of people being aggravated coming out of this movie because they were expecting something totally different. But I really enjoyed it.As far as appropriateness goes, there are quite a few bum shots and a fair amount of sexual innuendo.

120,Red_Flag,"Its isn't silky smooth, but it's pretty close.",6,20 August 2008,"Do you want to know what's worse than an Adam Sandler comedy. When I watch an Adam Sandler comedy and end up loving it. Here he has woven adult humour in with warmth. While he still might be sticking to his usual brand of low brow humour its done within reason and for a good cause. For all intensive purposes You Don't Mess With the Zohan appears to be the most grown up of all Adam Sadler comedies. It's not perfect, in fact its hugely flawed, twenty minutes to long and at times it runs jokes into the ground. That damn humus joke is done five or six times to much. But for all its failures and blasted cameos Zohan manages to create something that's often missing from an Adam Sadler comedy, characters you really care about, a warm outcome and the odd joke that is rather sophisticated.It often feels exhausting the jokes may be refreshing but the story drags and there are times in the second act in which you may just fall asleep. You wouldn't think Sandler's grown up what with the diabolical opener and a Few skits that outright fail. But Zohan has a tender touch. Where Chuck and Larry fail, being that for all its homophobic dribble it claims its pro-gay and ultimately it's just balls. Zohan on the other hand it makes these jokes but you see where its coming from. In no way is it offensive.The comedy follows the exploits of a Mossad agent who fakes his death so he can anonymously move to New York and become a hair stylist. The 'special services' which he gives his clients in the salon's back room soon attracts a large crowd of customers, who comment ""Well, the sex is good, and the haircut isn't bad either."" But things go awry when he is recognised by a former enemy, who soon becomes determined to kill him.Sandler works so hard at this, and so shamelessly, that he battered down my resistance. Like a Jerry Lewis out of control, he will do, and does, anything to get a laugh. No thinking adult should get within a mile of this film. I must not have been thinking. For my sins, I laughed. Sorry. I'll try to do better next time. I almost makes me want to apologise to Adam for the negative criticism. Was Click really as bad as I said it was, The Water boy is a fun night in and I always fall back on the wedding singer. Zohan isn't quite good enough to ream Sandler. Little Nicky remains on my most hated list and Happy Gilmore annoys me more and more on repeated visits but there's good mature material here. And it's not all done in vain. Unlike the rest of his films there is something to salvage from this.VERDICT: And Adam Sandler comedy that plays like a Ben Stiller Comedy. The jokes are crude and at times Zohan is painfully dull but all is made up with some solid material, a great outcome and some gags that will go down as Adam Sandler classics.

Try not to take it too seriously, it's what you expect in any Adam Sandler. Sophomoric, low-brow, raunchy humor. Get used to the innuendos and fart jokes, cause they're endless. As many penis jokes as this film had, they were actually funny. In The Love Guru, I groaned at all the pointless dick jokes. Here, Sandler plays a likable role. He's tough yet dim-witted, he's a man with a wild libido, and he has a tremendous love for hair. Expect really stupid material that is hilarious at the same time. It was so enjoyable. It's a great movie to show with friends around, there will be non-stop laughs. Every time I watch it, it gets better and better. My favorite of Sandler's is The Wedding Singer. As good as that movie is, I got a lot more chuckles from the Zohan. Overall, this is an extremely funny movie that I'll never forget, so leave your brain at the door and don't take it too seriously.

This is indeed Sandler's worst film offering up to this point in his career.This movie starts out slow and stupid and ends that way as well. Sandler attempted to achieve the same affect he had with I Now Pronounce You Chuck And Larry, trying to cool stereotypes about middle eastern people the way he did with gays in that film. Chuck and Larry was, at best, a mediocre watchable comedy. Zohan simply stinks.The only reason this film is not a 1 out of 10 is that there are maybe 3 or 4 funny moments. To be honest, I wish I had walked out of the theater within the first 10 minutes so that my girlfriend and I could find something better to do. Doing laundry would have been more fun.

125,pmdawn,"Fun, but too long",6,14 September 2008,"Adam Sandler, as Zohan, is a semi-superhuman Israeli agent whose dream is to become a hairdresser. This premise alone looks funny on paper, but does it work on screen?It did for me. Sandler does a very good job of becoming the Zohan, and this is crucial for a movie like this to work. However, there are many jokes that will be inevitably lost on a non-Jewish audience. The underlying message throughout the movie - stop the senseless and seemingly endless fighting - is very refreshing.So I enjoyed it, but some things were unnecessary (like the scene with the cat - you'll know when you see it - why did they think that was funny in any way?), others were obscure (for me) and in the end I think this movie suffers from over-exposure of jokes.There is too much focus on Zohan's ""abilities"", in fact, so much that they cease to be funny at a certain point. The story, which is simple, becomes a little convoluted as scenes that do nothing to further the plot or make you laugh (because you've seen it many times already) are crammed in for no apparent reason. There's a ""big-bad-corporation"" subplot that could have been cut short. More restriction in the editing room would be a wise move for Sandler's next works.With that said, it was funny and I can't really ask more from an Adam Sandler comedy. 6/10",You Don't Mess with the Zohan

I just didn't like the sexual jokes. I don't like perverted comedy, but this was so over the top it was very funny at times, I have to admit.Here's how I see it. I took off 2 points because of the perv comedy, which was way too excessive and than I took off another point because since there was so much perve comedy, it took up space that could have been used to make the movie a bit shorter, to concentrate on more respectable comedy, or to focus more on the love story.This movie is a bit top heavy, but still manages to have all the elements of a great Happy Madison production.",You Don't Mess with the Zohan

I can understand some of the criticism, it's a brainless comedy chop full of cliché jokes, stereotypes, crude toilet humor, so it's to be expected that it's going to receive a lot of negativity.With that said, that's exactly why I loved this movie so much. I'm a movie buff, have over 2,000 DVDs in my collection. I love virtually every movie genre there is. So, I knew full well what I was getting myself into before I paid my ten dollars and a Coke the size of Zohan's crotch.What I loved about this movie so much, was that the jokes never stopped coming. I've watched all of Sandlers movies, many of them have long breaks of nothing much to get in stitches about. Sandler is the type of actor that I look to for this sort of humor. When you're having a bad day and want to watch a brainless, popcorn flick that will most likely have you cracking up virtually the entire movie, then I suggest you see this movie as soon as possible.This is another reason why I love Sandler so much. He's not afraid to push the envelope to garner a laugh. He knows he's capable of doing a more serious role and have success. I know how good he was in Punch-Drunk Love and Reign Over Me, but he's very versatile and I can't complain about an actor with that quality.I gave this a 7 out of 10, I'm not afraid to admit that I liked the Zohan.., and I certainly wouldn't mess with him!",You Don't Mess with the Zohan

The only reason I give it a 5 rating is because of the beautiful girls that are thrown in throughout the movie, they were wonderful to watch.

133,LincolnSixEko,"The laughs are good, but the story is throwaway",6,10 October 2008,"Let me first start off by saying this is not the typical Adam Sandler movie. It has laughs yes, but the movie also carries action, tons of crazy stunts, and an extremely high rate of stereotypes, the latter is probably what hurts the movie the most.We've seen it all before in Hollywood movies; Middle eastern guy drives taxis and babbles crazy lines of dialog. The worst part of all this is the insane amount of terrorism jokes that are thrown in to be funny. I don't think and never will think that the events of 9/11 (regarding Middle Eastern people and United States people) can be easily transformed into a ""lighthearded"" joke. Its rampant throughout the film, offensive, and gets old very quickly.The plot is also throwaway. It starts out well and does a great job with character development. But truth be told, there's a lot of movie going on here, and its just not that interesting. I felt that a scene with all the ""suits"" talking in an exec room should have been shifted to an earlier part of the film because its an important one and would have defined the plot much better. It took over an hour to actually present the ""real"" problem that the movie was trying to convey, and by the time that happened, the last 35+ minutes or so crammed so much action,dialog and became over the top and movie bit off more than it could chew.The other thing which really irked me was Mariah Carey. She has a small cameo in the movie, says a funny line about a guy on TV, then instantly tells him to ""buy my new album"". It killed the joke completely. And as Adam Sandler is leaving the room, he mentions something of, ""love the new album"". Its like she only agreed to be in the film if she could have silly lines to plug her new CD, which I see as shameful. And she has to have one her songs play at the end, of course.On the bright side, Adam Sandlers character is likable. Hes smart, slick, good with the ladies, and respects people around him only until they mess with him. The supporting cast is also likable, with plenty of good jokes thrown in as well. And finally, the stunt work is professional stunt men with minimal CGI and pure eye candy which also made me laugh (especially when Sandler is swimming).Not a horrible movie but not for everyone. Its a decent watch; a rental at best. Its one of those movies that will probably hit the bargain bin before Christmas, but by then you'll have long forgot about it.5.5/10",You Don't Mess with the Zohan
134,Matador07,Surprisingly Funny,7,9 April 2009,"I have a shaky relationship with Adam Sandler movies, and after seeing a couple of unfunny trailers for this one I was not expecting much. But it got me.The premise is as thin and ridiculous as you get -- Israeli super-commando moves to New York to become a hair stylist. There is nothing there. But through sheer power of over the top zaniness and an utter willingness to offend anyone and everyone they milk some big laughs out of it. It went over the top at times and would lose me for a bit, but they kept on finding ways to tweak one more laugh out of the one note plot. There were a couple of parts where they made you laugh long enough it hurt. Its biggest flaw, given what it was, was just that it lasted a bit too long given how weak the premise was. Its a two hour movie and the concept would have had trouble holding up for an hour and a half, and so it loses steam there for a while about 2/3 of the way through before picking back up. This is especially true if you watch the unrated version, which I recommend you do -- this sort of raunchy material is at its best when its no holds barred and I suspect the unrated additions are some of the funniest bits.This is one of those movies that is always going to send the ninnies screaming out of the theater shocked and offended...and that is generally a good thing.

Though slightly amusing at times, I found myself rolling my eyes more than I found myself laughing. I love Adam Sandler. I aspire to marry him someday. With Adam, I have found that as the years go on, his films get worse and worse. My disappointment all started with Punch Drunk Love. It was down hill from there. This latest film is definitely the worst of all Sandler films. Disappointment after Disappointment and I still find myself running to the theater to see his latest creation.I was surprised at how many celebrity appearances there were. There were a bunch of celebs with small roles. The biggest role went to Mariah Carey who just so happens to be an awful actress. (Sorry Mariah). I think they added so many celebrities to this film because they knew just how bad it truly was.It was a ridiculous plot line with a few perverted jokes in between. What is with this new phase of filling movies with perverted jokes? The funniest part of this movie is how they used Hummus for everything.

143,RoboSlater,"Don't Mess With ""Zohan""",1,6 June 2008,"It's another moral equivalence movie. That, coupled with anti-Israel, anti-Semitic stereotypes, and bad, vulgar, disgusting jokes.I fell for the usual trick: the misleading, carefully edited Sandler movie trailers that include the only good jokes in the movie.I hoped that this very bad movie would be the exciting movie that makes fun of Islamic terrorists and shows Jews and Israelis in a positive light, rather than as weak, venal oppressors. I expected Sandler to act contrary to Hollywood's and his nature. I was wrong.It's a disgusting display of the same old, same old. And it's stupid. In fact, it's one of the worst movies I've seen in a long time.Mossad agent Zohan fakes his death in a fight against Arab terrorist ""The Phantom,"" and moves to New York.The Phantom is both Hezbollah and Palestinian, which gets even the most obvious details wrong. Why worry about accuracy on the basics, when you're busy making penis jokes and making fun of the Jews? So while Phantom is hailed throughout the Lebanese or Palestinian world (we're not sure which) and owns a chain of MuchenTuchen fast food restaurants (this is funny? Arabs speaking German sounding gibberish?), Zohan is busy trying to get a job at Paul Mitchell and other salons in New York.But, of course, the only one who will hire him is --shocker!-- the friendly, generous Palestinian woman salon owner, played by Moroccan Jew Emanuelle Chriqui. Oh, and --another shocker!-- they fall in love. Ignore that this is after Sandler has sex with about 100 grannies whose hair he's cut.A cab driver recognizes Zohan and informs. They plan to capture Zohan and kill him. But in the end, it's all Rodney King ""can't we all just get along?"" crap.Sound entertaining? It isn't. This movie's a mess, and I'm being generous.Instead of being funny and exploring the contradictions of Islamic terrorists who won't make peace and would rather send their own children to their deaths, we're given a steady supply of very graphic penis jokes (including a vulgar discussion of his pubic hair enhancement strategy) and scenes in which Sandler has sex with old ladies. We see lots of unnecessary shoots of Sandler's (or a body double's) naked butt, and every other comment is about ""making the big bang boom."" Yup, those randy, Israeli sex fiends. To enhance the ""point,"" Sandler wears a sock or some other artificial enhancement under tight bike shorts throughout the movie to make his groin region look big.Haha, funny. You know the depraved, slutty life that Bin Laden likes to say America is living? That's this movie.Then, there are the running Israeli stereotypes. We're hit over the head with Sandler's sleazy Israeli friends who cheat people with bad merchandise at electronics stores. They all wear shirts unbuttoned down to there and look like they're just off the ""Saturday Night Fever"" set. The stereotype was bad enough when it was a short skit on ""Saturday Night Live,"" over a decade ago, when Sandler and guest host Tom Hanks used bad Israeli accents and blasphemed Judaism, citing the Jewish sabbath as some reason to defraud customers. But in this movie, it's non-stop. In fact, the whole movie is like a bad SNL skit.And, yes, Israelis, like Americans, wore jean shorts when they were in style. But Sandler wears them like that's the Israeli uniform. It ain't. You think Israelis are cheesy dolts, Adam. We get it.The hummus joke wasn't funny when he brushed his teeth with it. Even less funny as hair mousse and to put out a fire.Oh, and by the way, the fire was set by his evil white landlord who is the common enemy of the Israelis and the Muslims in this movie. Yes, American Muslim extremists are not my real enemy. It's corporate America and evil developers.Yes, the message in this movie is that, Muslims and Jews, Palestinians and Israelis all get along here in America and don't hate each other in the least. Sad that the 10,000 Muslim Lebanese and Palestinians who marched with anti-Semitic slogans in their speeches and on signs in Dearborn during the 2006 Israel-Hezbollah war, didn't get the Sandler memo.Our real enemy is not each other, goes the Sandler didactic. It's Whitey and corporate America.A few cameos in this movie--Henry Winkler, Mariah Carey, and Chris Rock, to name a few. But their brief appearances are like attending an Adam Sandler PC beach party, of which this silly movie is the on screen equivalent.Do yourself a favor and watch the 2-minute trailer for this movie. You'll see most of what's funny in this movie and save yourself ten bucks.Other than what's in the trailer for this movie, there's very little that made me chuckle and a lot that made me groan. An Arab terrorist training, Rocky-style, to fight Zohan made me laugh. He runs up a desert sand dune to the tune of ""Gonna Fly Now,"" the Rocky theme song, played by the Mid-Eastern Oud instrument. But other than that, this movie does to Israel and the Jews what Bin Laden, Hezbollah, and HAMAS could not, in defaming them on the silver screen.This movie is high quality Bin Laden Cinema.Take Adam Sandler's advice, Don't Mess with ""Zohan.""

144,wolverinesforever,"Uneven, but funny",7,7 June 2008,"Look folks, this is ADAM SANDLER we're talking about here. Yes, this is the same stuff that he was doing ten years ago with ""The Waterboy."" Yes, this is the same company that brought us ""Happy Gilmore"" and ""Click."" And yes, while I have aged a bit since I could appreciate the his silliness, there is still a part of me that enjoys the goofy fun that Adam Sandler likes to put on screen. I knew very well coming in to the 7:45 showing of ""You Don't Mess with the Zohan"" that this was going to be crazy. And sure enough, it was. But you know what, I liked it, my friend liked it, quite a few people in the audience liked it, it was a good time had.Adam Sandler loves to put himself in ridiculous situations. In ""Gilmore,"" he was a hockey nut with a hidden talent for golf. In ""Mr. Deeds,"" he became a billionaire overnight. This guy has played football (twice), gone on fifty first dates, paused and sped up his life, and married Kevin James. Now, he's an Isreali counter-terrorist with a fetish for cutting hair. Oh, and he loves making sexual remarks as much as Borat does. Sound familiar? Thought it did.So how does the humor compare to previous Sandler features? Well, it's unfocused. Part of the problem is that three writers with different mentalities are writing the script. The silliness comes from Sandler, the raunchy stuff comes from Apatow, and everything else comes from Smigel. Although I found myself laughing at quite a few parts (particularly when the Zohan was on the job as a soldier), there were also a lot of parts where I was thinking to myself ""Come on. Another shot of the crotch?"" (Or butt, or some other sexual reference) All of these various ingredients have been thrown in together, and the end result is, let's face it, uneven.But though the movie may have lacked focus, I couldn't help but have fun with it. You see, unlike ""Mr. Deeds"" (which I found boring and lame), this film goes whole hog. Sandler and the cast surrounding him do almost everything in their power to make a joke out of something. These guys aren't sleepwalking through their roles, to the contrary, they're having a great time putting on a show. It's contagious. About halfway through the movie, I began to realize the reason I was having fun with the ""Zohan"" was because this movie essentially gives out an open invitation to enjoy the silliness that was being presented. By the end of the movie, Sandler had done the most outrageous acts I had seen him do since ""Happy Gilmore."" And frankly, I think I prefer Sandler when he just tries everything.Fans of Sandler will most likely enjoy this one, non-fans should pass.

Happy Gilmore, 50 First Dates and Anger Management are all part of my movie collection, but this film is a complete mess. I tried watching it on HBO last night and had to flip away. The movie's plot consists of an Israeli Mossad super agent or IDF super commando who fakes his death and moves to New York to pursue his dream of becoming a stylist. He succeeds and his clients made up of mainly middle aged and elderly make him a sensation. All this happens why a group of Palestinians dissidents are trying to assassinate him. The humor of this film is made up of over the top Matrix-style action scenes, rampant stereotyping of Middle Eastern peoples and tasteless sex jokes. For some reason the producers of this film thought the mental image Sandler's character servicing clients in the back room of the salon where he works would be funny. I also believe Adam Sandler is the single reason why Rob Shcneider stays employed these days. Trying to sit through this movie is an exercise in personal sadism. Blame the director.

A film like this may have worked back in the mid 1990's but today it just doesn't blend. The film era of movies like zohan, chuck and larry, dumb and dumber and bench warmers have been and gone. Adam sandler and the rest of the actors still doing films like this need to move on to more serious projects and forget the past and bring themselves into the 21st century like sandler's 2007 film reign over me. The only thing zohan film did do that was present day was the theme of the film regarding mossad and terrorism, Other than that zohan looked as though it was written in 1990 but they left it until now to release it. We are living in a more serious world nowdays There is no room anymore for films like zohan,benchwarmers.

I can only imagine they thought they'd cash in on Borat's success but missed the plot completely. What's even more surprising is some of the people who are in it..! Did they read the script?? In short, I think you need to be on something (and something strong) to find this garbage even remotely funny. About as bad as it gets.

150,donjeffries,"A New Low, Even For Hollywood",1,10 June 2008,"I knew Adam Sandler was one of the most monstrously untalented ""comedians"" ever to disgrace the American scene, but this ""Zohan"" movie is even beneath him. First of all, can someone interview Sandler's elementary and middle school teachers, to find out just how bullied and abused he was? This guy has the most ridiculous self-esteem issues I've ever seen; in every movie, he has to be the ""tough guy,"" beating up much bigger opponents with ease. Considering how small and nerdy Sandler appears, this might work once or twice if played for laughs, but it is presented in dead seriousness in every film he makes, and we are supposed to swallow it. Now, however, his laughable Zohan character is not only ""tough,"" he also has a big penis. Really big. And the audience is reminded of this over and over again, with shots of his childishly padded crotch, which he also grabs constantly for emphasis. This is the kind of ""humor"" that is momentarily popular among the more immature 11 or 12 year old boys. Anyone older than that who finds this kind of ""humor"" funny should not be allowed to vote. I won't repeat the stuff others have, about Zohan servicing old ladies so hard they can barely walk afterwards, or the typically gratuitous and utterly offensive use of toilet humor. That is Sandler's ""comedy"" trademark, and it has, incomprehensibly enough, made him a huge fortune.I would urge everyone who has any self-respect to avoid this film like the plague. Any amount of money it makes is too much. The fact that such an odious film can be made, and given a rating that ensures a lot of kids will see it, is a clear indicator of just how far we've fallen as a civilization. Not so long ago, no self-respecting adult would use an offensive word like ""retard"" in public. Now, everyone feels free to do so, and no one seems to care. It would have been unthinkable, even 20 years ago, for any film to feature the farting, vomiting, peeing, etc., that is the foundation of every ""comedy"" plot in Hollywood now. While the aptly titled ""Superbad"" seemed about as horrendous as any film could possibly be, ""Zohan"" has accomplished the nearly impossible task of actually being worse. You'd have to call this one Super Super Bad. While I don't think Sandler, or Jack Black, or Seth Rogan, or any of the other bright young ""stars"" of Hollywood, can reasonably hope to make a movie that is more objectionable, less watchable, or all-around awful than ""Zohan,"" I certainly wouldn't say it's impossible. They seem intent on constantly ""topping"" themselves, but it will be an arduous task to outdo this totally abominable film.",You Don't Mess with the Zohan
151,matrix29,The South Park manatees were working hard on this movie,2,21 June 2008,"The upside of this movie is that Adam Sandler looks pretty hot with a beard or goatee. That's pretty much it for the good points. The scenes are in focus plus well decorated, the lighting is good, the sound is audible with many of the voiced redubbed fairly clearly, the special effects shots are competently handled, and the clothing looks appropriate for the settings.I did like a number of the actresses playing customers in the hair salon. These wonderful women (under-appreciated for not having ""super pretty young girl looks"") were about the only high points of the movie. Ido Mosseri playing the ""best friend"" role while not being not too obnoxious for an Adam Sandler movie helped pull many of the horribly acted scenes together and he is well-suited for a major movie role so long as he does not become ego-blinded. Emmanuelle Chriqui played her role well. Lainie Kazan performed well too and worked well with Ido Mosseri.Now onto the major flaws in the movie. STORYBOARDING - Far too many scenes don't know how to frame Adam Sandler's spastic ego-blinded movements to appear as ""a guy who is in charge while not caring how the world sees him"" versus having him really appear as he really is, ""a guy going through worthwhile emotional growth with wisdom but coming off as a dorky spazz with too much pushy power for his own good to listen to people noting that to everyone else he is acting like a big dorky spazz drunk on power"".DIRECTION - Adam Sandler though was indulged in far too many shots that never worked for the betterment of the movie. The camera placements on the stunt effects resulted in the least impressive reactions to the shots. I think perhaps that this movie needed an oppressive laugh track to cover up the fact that none of the scenes ever reached a ""funny"" status.WRITING - Much of the movie was brought down by the lame 35-year-out-of-date stereotypes. This weakness oddly enough was a bonus in noting how severely retarded the Middle Eastern nations are morally and ethically and culturally. I am conflicted on whether using the stereotypes (with super-lame outdated stereotype dialog) was some kind of deep political plotting to undermine much of the severely retarded culture of the Middle Eastern nations or just crappy hack writing from a giddy comedy writer smoking too much weed while the sober people around them groan in unentertained boredom. The humus running gag just never really worked.ACTING - Although many of the secondary actors performed superbly and sold me on their characters, some stand out as just getting worse and worse with each future role. Adam Sandler was brilliant in ""CLICK"" but here he doesn't seem to be able to comprehend any remote concept of whether the scene that was just shot was ""funny"". Sandler seriously needs to hire some smart unprejudiced fanboy or clever fangirl of MST3K to review shot scenes and detail what worked comedy-wise and what failed. This is not an understatement. Rob Schneider was great in ""Deuce Bigalow"", but he also needs to hire some secondary person who is not a butt-kisser to tell him whether his scenes are funny or not funny and why specifically the not-funny failed. I am trying to be kind as possible, but frankly this movie is proof that Adam Sandler no longer has any clue why people found him amusing (in the same way that Tom Green no longer has a clue that he was funny for rehashing a slightly more perverse version of Allen Funt's CANDID CAMERA gags). Kevin Nealon failed to sell his briefly seen character and seems to have forgotten how to act entirely despite his hilarious skill in SNL. I wonder if Kevin Nealon has been afflicted with some level of chronic pain preventing him from caring about how he earns a paycheck. Nick Swardson plays a great ""Terry"" on ""Reno 911"" and was great in ""Grandma's Boy"", here he is just over-playing the importance of his role and needs to tone it down to a level fitting the role he is playing.SCENES - This movie just kept the not-amusing levels of agony going mercilessly. Zohan at the beach. The scene would have worked better rather having Sandler appear interested versus bored intensely with the characters that are supposed to be close friends.The scene in the Israeli intelligence office where Zohan kicks the guy in front of him and nobody reacts in the slightest. Why is watching somebody else's home-made travel movies dull? It is because the people that did not travel lack emotional attachment to the scenes. Give the viewer a reason to care by getting them emotionally involved. If you are bored while making this movie, your audience will be intensely bored when viewing your movie. It kind of reminded me of cheap porn in the same way that the actors all looked overly bored while deriving no pleasure from something that should be very enjoyable if done correctly.Sadly, the intended ""funny"" part of the story all revolved about the ""gross incompetence"" of a man who made it to America and could drive a cab while doing live marketing calls and keep track of his backseat passengers complaints. These characters could have been better served with more minor backstory to make them somewhat conflicted culturally-enslaved characters driven to do horrible deeds despite the fact that they no longer live in the retarded Middle Eastern lands. I walked out around the second ""Hezbollah Hotline"" call after the redneck vandalism squad was hired. I figured that since I was so intensely bored and not even working up a slight chuckle at the movie.

152,hendry-robert,What was the real point of this movie,7,6 September 2008,"Clearly Sandler was putting out his political message here and rather clumsily at that. But, while some of the underlining politics made me cringe as they were portrayed in such a simplistic and I'm afraid to say wholly unrealistic and quite fantastical point of view. Namely that the Palestine and Israel issue could all blow over if everyone just decided to become pals (just like in the movie). The reality is the issue goes much much deeper than Sandler and Co seem to think and the deep felt resentment held by both sides is not something that's going to vanish because of a rather clumsy message in a Hollywood movie. My only real gripe with this type of Hollywood film with its fairy tale like message is that in the near future I will be confronted with an 18 year old fanatical dreamer who will scream at me everyone should just be happy. You see, films like this do leave a message in the subconscious whether people realise it or not.However, as a funny movie I liked it very much. I do like inane rude humour. I mean, catching a ball in the crack of your A$$ is funny if you like that sort of stuff. While funny on one or two occasions the gags concerning elderly woman being sexually attended to by Zohan were funny but I thought they were over done after the same gag was repeated for about 20 times. I also wonder about some of these elderly actors and think have they always been so liberal or is it a case of I still want to be an actor at any price because in their day when growing up the things they say and do on screen now just would have been unthinkable then.I was slightly sad to see that the only 'bad' people in the movie were the white Americans while all the Jews, Arabs, Muslims etc. were all wonderful peace loving folks who would do no one any harm. Not only were the white Americans the actual terrorists (that's a laugh in its self) but they were of course obligatory racist and fascist. A shame that again I see Hollywood concerned with self loathing based on fantasy. Even after all my criticisms which are mainly the underlining political message I do recommend the film if your in need of cheering up. There's a good amount of shock value and some moments of comedy you probably haven't seen before, which come to think of it are those shock value scenes. I guess that's how it needs to work these days, shock the audience, then up the shock value an don and on we go. I think its a matter of time before we see actual sex on screen in the name of comedy which I will undoubtedly find hilarious.What was the real point of this movie then? Well its another on Sandlers belt, but i have a feeling Sandler was pushing his political message and at the end of the day to the untrained political activist hes done a great job, or disservice depending on how you look at it. It wont however bring peace to the middle east.",You Don't Mess with the Zohan

The guy eats them anyway, ridiculous. The humor is a stupid kind of funny.

The movie is racist, but I can't decide against whom. Don't get me wrong, I can handle some racially charged humor, when it's actually funny, but come on. On one hand, the middle eastern characters are walking stereotypes (terrorists, cab drivers, etc.) and on the other hand, the only white people in the movie were the evil rich guy, the evil lawyers cruelly trying to shut down the minority-based neighborhood and a gang of drooling, racist rednecks with mullets that had no idea why they hated people different from themselves (an obvious crack at the TEA Party, which was absurd, even for liberal Hollywood). That aside, nothing in this movie was funny. Literally nothing. The whole business about him having s*x with the old women was completely unnecessary and a pathetic attempt at gross out humor. Not that I care about hairdressing, but shouldn't that at least have been part of the movie, considering it was one of the primary themes? All we ever see is him washing the hair of women and having s*x with them.

156,piverba,Adam Sandler's contribution to Israeli-Palestinian conflict resolution,8,4 September 2008,"What do you do with a socio-political issue that persists in the course of 50+ years and just would not obtain a resolution? Many had tried: country leaders, scientists, political party leaders, clergy, and business people  at no avail. In the ""You Don't Mess "" Adam Sandler shows his way  through humor  and his way is not as impotent as may appear. Sandler is not afraid to be silly and funny, for him there are neither sacred cows nor political correctness. He believes that life should be, most importantly, fun and then everything else. Yes, his sense of humor is more slap-stick rather than subtle and intellectual. But what subtlety is there for regular working people, with families, thousand-year traditions, prejudices, religious and national differences. How you bridge this chasm? With love, sex, humor, all the things that make us feel good about each other.Why I gave it 8 out of 10? - Because the script and the film could have been made better, more solid, funnier. The jokes are somewhat stale, of uneven quality. Perhaps Sandler should collaborate with a more skillful script writer.

It was easy to follow and mostly the movie a lot of people have seen. A lot of people have said it is a very good film that they enjoyed the movie.Mainly the movie is about the Zohan (Adam Sandler) who works for the military in the counter terrorist unit and he goes to Iraq to catch the Phantom (John Turturro) the bad guy in this movie. Nothing can hurt the Zohan I don't know why but nothing can. The Phantom is the same way they are equal in that way. Well the Zohan gets tired of his job and fakes his own death. So that he can go to America to live his dream as being a hairdresser. The Phantom almost has the same passion for things in that area except he likes shoes instead of hair. The Zohan gets to America and goes to a crappy salon and makes it a hit. In the end the Zohan and the Phantom settle their differences and save there community from a fire.The Zohan is the Protagonist he is the main character. He's more of a carefree type of character he goes with the flow but does the job just to get it done. He is tired of the fighting between Iraq and America he just wants a normal life with no worries.The Phantom is the Antagonist he doesn't really like the Zohan like everybody else does. The Zohan and him are mortal enemies they don't get along. Since he is from Iraq and he is from America they are fighting for there countries.All in all the movie was pretty good they settled their differences and saved everyone.

Probably the right choice of attitude upon reflection as it allowed me to enjoy this movie for what it is; a silly, crude, slapsick romp.The patronisingly blatant political commentary does not suit the film. Yes the message attempting to be conveyed was one of peace and good will, but you are spoon fed the ""can't we all just get along"" philosophy so frequently and overtly throughout, it becomes quickly tiresome.Sandler also wrangles in the regular cameos including John McEnroe, Kevin James, Rob Schneider and John Tuturro among others, and while some play an integral and actually quite funny part of the story, it does just seem like Sandler is seeing just how many of his buddies he can crowbar into one of his films. I think its about the point where I'm tired of seeing the same 5-10 people taking all the notable roles in his films.This film did make me laugh on multiple occasions though, which given the recent standard of so called ""comedies"" is quite an achievement in my eyes. This film was not written under the pretence of trying to be a witty political satire, and instead plumps for the pubic hair and boob job jokes which I will concede, are pulled off with great gusto and seem to work well. Most of the jokes are well written and the visual comedy is pretty surreal but still elicited quite a few chuckles.As ever with Sandler films what is gained in laughs is lost in large quantities in other areas. Although unusual and original the story gets progressively more ludicrous as the film continues (which has its ups and downs depending on what you look for in this film) and the ending, although funny, is completely stupid.The acting isn't great, but it is good enough to still find the intended material funny. And even if you don't laugh at that, Sandler's attempt at a middle eastern accent will at least put a smirk on your face.Probably worth seeing if you are willing to just sit back and appreciate the comedy and try to ignore the other sub par features of this film.

I mean a comedy about an Irsaeli Mossad agent fighting Comedy Arab terrorists- is pure genius. Plus it's even more hilarious when Sandler fakes his own death to become a hairdresser in Brooklyn, his libido style makes him a hit with middle aged ladies when he gets his chance. Even better when his sworn enemy The Phamtom- superbly played by John Tuturro has also come to New York to face him with amusing results. Rob Schneider is also very amusing as a grumpy Arab taxi driver. I also like the fact that it shows the realistic portrayals of Arab/Jewish communities in New York mingling together. I know this is a hard sell to many people, but if you lighten up and forget the ignorant prejudices this is a very funny film.

Adam Sandler was never a powerful actor, and neither was Rob Schneider. So they try to go by the way of comedic effort, only with mediocre results. In every movie, Sandler has to act tough, he does something wrong and is forced to fix those problems until they're solved, with some comedy thrown in along the way. You Don't Mess with the Zohan however, wasn't funny at all. It was insulting, and why would Sandler want to go around servicing those old ladies? The humor in this movie was indeed that, ""potty"" humor. Stuff that middle aged kids like and anyone who has seen movies that were even somewhat decent should avoid seeing films like this.Sandler has only made a couple of decent titles, and to think that a film like this one should even be considered good is ridiculous. We are reminded again and again that Sandler doesn't have the talent to expand further, because every movie he has made has been the same plot, setting and character. A good actor would know how to play multiple roles in various movies, spanning from the hilarious to the drama suspense type. But here, it's the ""been there, done that"" routine.

He is basically an unbeatable soldier. They over exaggerate it and make him seem invincible. We learn that he has a love for hair styling, and has a Paul Mitchell Hair Style book that is 20 years old. He tries to tell his parents about his love for hair styling, but they laugh. When Zohan tries to capture the head terrorist he fakes his death, and takes a plane to America. On the plane he performs his first hair styling on himself and dogs. They make Hummus jokes throughout the entire movie, and their is one with the dogs. Zohan tries to get a job at the Paul Mitchell hair salon, but the people laugh at him, and they won't give him a job. He can't get a job at any salon, because he tries to attack the dreadlocks. He meets his cousin who owns a electronic store, which they make a lot of jokes out of. His cousin convinces him to get a job at a Palestinenan store. Zohan gets a job as a hair sweeper. Finally one day he convinces the lady to give him a chance. He cuts one old lady's hair and she loves it. After the haircut he ""Bangs"" her.Suddenly everyone wants Zohan to cut their hair. A Palestinian cab driver realizes that Zohan is really the hair dresser and tries to stop Zohan. In the end the Israelis and the Palestineans work together to stop a racist landlord from building a mall. The whole movie is funny. Every 30 seconds people were cracking up.

This, let me warn you, is a set-up for disappointment.I went through a period of heavy admiration for his work when I was at the target age (12-15). But this is the first Sandler flick I've seen since Anger Management, and not much has changed since that movie came out four years ago. The jokes are juvenile and over-the- top, SNL alums show up in cameos at random, and the story-line is secondary to beating running gags to death. I admit that I really enjoyed the movie for about thirty minutes: the laughs came consistently, there was a lot of over-the-top action, and as well as partially witty dialog. But the whole thing went stale as it developed tried to develop a love story between Sandler and a Palestinian salon owner. Another thing that bothered me is the disregard for the realities of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. I'm not one to expect political commentary in even the dumbest of comedies, but an entire film that touches hot-button issue should offer something in addition to big-penis jokes. Couldn't they have taken a page from South Park's book?The climax was more in tune with opening: lots of silly action, and some empty laughs.

181,The-Stalingraduates-review,great fun to watch,8,2 October 2012,"with his movies, Sandler tends to be hit or miss. this one hits, and it hits rather well, in which it has become one of my favourite Sandler films. you can try and hold back from laughing but one way or another, Sandler will break through. and you will laugh.where a lot of the comedy comes from is the main character, Zohan. Sandler gets lost in this role, making this high energy, out of place but hilariously bad ass character. i genuinely forgot i was watching a Sandler film a couple of times. both him and his rival, The Phantom, defy the laws of physics many times, including an immunity to pain, broken bones and bleeding, defying gravity and more, adding for some really funny moments. i find the controversy with this film amusing, because i can see in instances that it is borderline offensive. i don't know too much about Israeli and Palestinian culture, but enough to work out a good amount of the jokes told, and how offensive this film was getting. although it does seem to exhibit signs that the Israeli Commando's are ungodly powerful (they kind of are really)the story was OK, well done in places, but by the end becomes badly structured (the ancient sound that was thrown in in the last 10 minutes destroys the villain who was introduced in the last 20 minutes. seriously? bit of a rush for time i think) but the story isn't what really counts here, nor is it in a fair few of Sandlers films. you're there for the comedy, and a lot of the time, that's where Sandler excels. The Longest Yard and Happy Gilmore didn't have brilliant plots, but featured some really funny gags. overall, you will have a blast with this film. its not ground breaking stuff, the acting's decent, the comedy is damn funny and energetic, and Sandler in this lead role is a surprising amount of fun to watch. it is a little mindless, but whats wrong with turning your brain off every once in a while and enjoying some dumb fun?",You Don't Mess with the Zohan

I was thinking, 'this is going to be a great movie.' STOP!!! Hold on. when this movie got towards the middle, where he first gets a job at a low class hair salon, i felt sick beyond all reasons. Never have I seen a movie this revolting. The previews for this movie never even gave hints as to what I was seeing. Okay, Zohan has sex with a teenagers mom? and the comment after, ""I don't think i can walk,"" made me sick. I can take sex jokes. But not with people this old. when he starts making a sex name for himself at the hair salon, old women start pouring in. I was just about to get up and walk out the theater with the other 25% of the other people when the movie cut to two old women in skimpy nurse outfits. Im not joking either, about 25% of the movie watchers walked out. Not to mention it shows the teenagers moms butt, Zohan bangs the elderly women in the back room when he's done with their hair and has the women limp out of the back room, so on and so forth. It looked like Adam had wrote the beginning to be funny, and some twisted insane person walked into his room and wrote the middle. The ending was more humorous relief. Basically, a good side-splitting movie at the beginning and end and no middle.

As an American trying to imitate a primitive middle east immigrant, he reminds you of Borat. Trust me though, only that idea is what they have in common: where Borat delivers fun moments and unexpected hilarious moments, Zohan does not completely fail at that, but mostly does. Worse than being not funny, half of the ""jokes"" are very stupid and below bottom line. And I'm not talking stupid in a funny way.I add to that the overstretched length of this movie and the fact the only fun moments of it are in the first 30-45 minutes. From there on, the quality drops at high rate.I should have believed in the negative critics from other reviewers, as they are right. The jokes about the Isreali-Palestinian conflict are barely funny as well, plus someone said the movie was funnier if you speak Hebrew... now thats not too many of us.5 stars (a lot for this silly rubbish) for the cool moments and Adam Sandler as Zohan.",You Don't Mess with the Zohan

Compared to his previous work, I have seen Adam do much better. There were some corny parts but overall I say this will probably be the better comedies of this summer.I would like to see Adam and Kevin James team up again as I feel they work very well together.

188,joecunningham14,Review from deusexmachinafilm.blogspot.com,5,31 August 2008,"You never know quite what to expect with an Adam Sandler film, or more accurately which Adam Sandler is going to turn up. There's the serious Sandler of the excellent 'Punch Drunk Love', the solid Sandler of 'Click' and '50 First Dates' or the silly Sandler of 'The Waterboy' and 'Little Nicky'. Unfortunately whichever Sandler does turn up it's likely that Rob Schneider and his unique brand of humourless comedy will be close by. In the form of The Zohan, Sandler is unquestionably in silly mode, a format which has yielded mixed results for him in the past. It's usually a question of whether he toes the line or just goes all out, both can be successful but the middle ground is dangerous territory.The Zohan is the greatest Israeli counter-terrorism agent the world has ever seen, his arch-nemesis is The Phantom (John Turturro), a Palestinian terrorist. Following a showdown between the two Sohan fakes his own death and travels to New York to follow his dream of becoming a hair stylist and making the world ''silky smooth''. Renaming himself Scrappy Coco, the only job he can find is in a Palestinian salon on a street divided into Palestinian and Israeli businesses. Trouble surfaces when Zohan is recognised by a cab driver Salim (Schneider) threatening Zohan's new-found success.Unfortunately with Zohan, Sandler has ventured too far into the aforementioned middle ground, as ridiculous (in a good way) that The Zohan is the constraints of the storyline stunt the comedic potential. Sandler is used to playing this sort of role and unsurprisingly becomes The Zohan with ease but the bland supporting characters leave a lot to be desired. Emmanuelle Chriqui is perfectly fine as the token hottie/love interest, Turturro's diluted version of Zohan is solid and even Schneider isn't as terrible as usual. But they're all just there, underdeveloped and uninteresting characters that only serve to highlight that this is all about The Zohan. There are some genuine laughs garnered from the Israeli but all too often these are the start of a long baron patch, the next laugh arriving with a sense of relief rather than satisfaction.Where Sandler does earn some kudos is in his sensible handling of a potentially dangerous subject matter. The Israeli conflict is not an obvious source for comedy but the 'war is stupid, why can't we all just get along' message is conveyed well and any jokes made at the expense of the warring parties are thankfully far from offensive. This may be the film's saving grace, there is at least some thought behind the madness and it's commendable that a mainstream comedy should even attempt to tackle such a heavyweight issue. It would have been far easier for Sandler to pump out another vanilla comedy like last year's 'I Pronounce You Chuck and Larry', the next target surely must be to make a comedy with a message...that's actually funny.Verdict: It's not great but Sandler's made far worse in his time. However, it's unlikely to be rivalled as the Israeli conflict comedy of the year.",You Don't Mess with the Zohan

Interwoven between all the funny was the reality that the middle east has been a powder keg forever and it is likely it will be that way till the end of time. Sandler seems to be trying to point out that the regular, every day people from the middle east are much like we are, sick of wars and fighting. We just want to raise our children and grow old with our better half.Mariah Carey being in the movie is just another gag, but it comes off OK because she's spoofing the things she has to put up with as a famous person.I was pleasantly surprised with this movie.

There were times when I couldn't help but laugh.It could be subtitled ""Stereotypes R Us"" because it's rife with those, but that plays into the comedy. And is it my imagination or does Adam Sandler look younger now than he did when he was a regular on SNL?

Ten minutes into the flick I was ready to walk out and see if I could sneak into one of the 'better' films ... then something happened. Adam Sandler is what happened. I found myself pulled into the film. There is a key turning point early on where the film changes (trust me, you'll know what I mean, but it's still a ridiculous film all the way through). The first 10 - 15 minutes I was simply watching a dumb movie ... a waste of money, yet it was the beginning that helped pull me in ... don't miss the beginning. If you want realism then you don't want this film. If you want Adam Sandler, you don't want to miss it, but give him a chance! OK, after becoming absorbed, first into his character, then into the overall plot of the film, I began to step back and realize what they are doing here. This is about immigration, this is about racism, this is about people from many cultures together in one country trying to live and make a living together. Underneath all the silliness, the film has plenty of real meaning. I will re-iterate here, the film is stupid ... so stupid you break out laughing. The film is quite dirty for a PG-13.

To put it simply, this movie is awful!",1,8 June 2009,"Most professional critics hate Adam Sandler. They have hated every single movie he has been in and despite that, some of his movies have had huge cult followings and are loved by millions. Maybe those millions are all idiots? Who knows. Nevertheless, I think this time, the critics are 100 percent right about his latest movie, The Zohan. I'll admit, I was a fan of Sandler and despite the fact that all his movies are exactly the same and are about as predictable as a Saturday morning cartoon, they for the most part have been pretty entertaining from Billy Madison to The Waterboy. I've always seen Sandler's films as The Three Stooges like, totally idiotic but somehow irresistible and yes, funny.Not this time though. The Zohan is just too awful and even the biggest Sandler fans are going to have a very hard time liking this movie. It's bad in every possible way. The acting is horrible, Sandler talks with a stupid Middle Eastern accent the whole film. If you hated his Waterboy voice, that's nothing compared to this one. The supporting acting is just as awful and the story is so ridiculous. Sandler is a Zohan in this film. He's pretty much an immortal force. He's like a retarded version of Superman.The plot of the film is even worse and it will insult your intelligence. I already mentioned that he's a superhuman force who fights in wars and kills everybody and is unkillable. Well, he's sick of the war life and he wants to move to America to be a.....hair stylist. I guess that's suppose to be funny, but it's not. Nothing is funny about this movie. He somehow lands a job as a hair sweeper and then moves to a hair stylist when he blows everyone away with his special ability; to have sex with the old women customers. Yup, it's true. That's only the beginning. I mean what else can I really say to convince you that this movie is horrible. I don't think I need to detail the whole plot because it's not there to begin with and it's just such a horribly executed movie in every way. There really is no reason for anyone to like this film. I mean how can it be done? The bottom line is Sandler sucked a big fat one. Easily his worst movie and probably one of the worst movies this decade, easily.

199,d_man1890,Recommended to Israeli,6,27 June 2008,"""You don't mess with the Zohan"" is a comedy starring Adam Sandler who's portraying an ex-Israeli soldier who fakes his death and goes to NY to become a hair dresser. The idea itself is great and it allows plenty of room for stereotype jokes and some funny action scenes. The problem is that some of the jokes are only suitable for Israeli audience, and the action scenes are done terribly on purpose, making the viewer laugh at the bad FX. There's a feeling of miss in this movie, because it promises to be a light comedy filled with Sandlers' humor mixed with Israeli attitude, while in reality we get a gross movie filled with humiliating moments and not funny sex jokes. I can recommend this movie only to Adam Sandler fans, or to Israeli people who'd enjoy the many references and Israeli ambiance (Many Israeli artists have participated in the soundtrack including the ""Dag Nahash"").

I cannot understand how anyone could even imagine making such a worthless, terrible movie. I did not expect much out of this, but even a ridiculous plot like this has to have some sort of redeeming quality, right? Wrong. I watched this mainly out of curiosity. For one thing, this should not have gotten a PG-13 rating. My guess is that PG-13 will allow more young people to buy tickets to see this (or more parents to allow their kids to see it), and therefore drive up profits. But that's just my point of view. Anyway, some of the jokes and situations were so crude--warning to any parents with 10 year olds: this is most definitely not for them. Speaking of the crudeness- the sex jokes, sexual references, stereotypes, etc., were not just stupid, but immature, overused, and ridiculous. Crotch shots? Check. Banging old women? Check. Naked arse? Check. Unrealistically large, ahem, package? Check. Okay, we get it, now let's move on. Unfortunately, the producers of the flick thought that filling nearly two hours of filming with outlandish jokes, action scenes, 'banging old women' scenes, and racial stereotypes (which, by the way, are FAR from funny and VERY far from true), would make up for the emptiness of the plot. Well, for any sane person, it just doesn't work that way. I cannot express how stupid this movie is. Not even Torturro could save it.",You Don't Mess with the Zohan

203,redserpent7,Stay Away from the Zohan,3,13 June 2008,"You Don't Mess with the Zohan is another one of Sandler's ""Happy Maddison"" productions and by all means its a load of crap. I did find some scenes were somewhat funny, two maybe, the rest of the movie was amazingly boring. Adam Sandler Plays a Mossad agent who got fed up of all the killing so he jumps to the US to become a hair stylist or to make ""Silky Smooth"" hair as Sandler describes it. The movie started pretty good, unfortunately this only lasted for a couple of minutes as all the other scenes throughout repetitive and somewhat disgusting. From Sandler catching a fish between his butt cheeks to Sandler trying to impress his employer by fooling around with middle aged / old women. In the way we meet Schnider's character, which is a Palestinian terrorist wannabe who tries to capture Zohan (Sandler) and trade him or whatever he was up to, not really sure. From what angle you look at this ""movie"" there's something that doesn't feel right. I really like Sandler movies including the recent ""I now pronounce you Chuck and Larry"", I find the latter much more amusing and original than this one. So stay away from this one by all means, there is no need to waste money on it as there is nothing original or worth your money in it.",You Don't Mess with the Zohan
204,spirit_of_truth2000,Among the bottom of the barrel.,1,8 June 2008,"""You Don't Mess With the Zohan"" is the newest regurgitated $hitfest unleashed upon us by the brilliant minds of comedian Adam Sandler and director Dennis Dugan. The movie chronicles the absurd, zany story of Zohan Dvir, a ridiculously offensive special agent of an Isralei counter-terrorism organization known as the ""Mossad"". His extraordinarily stupid fake accent and personality that would insult the intelligence of an eleven year old give the writers, (Adam Sandler, Judd Apatow, and SNL writer Robert Smigel) the framework to create a movie that is incomprehensibly bad. The movie begins with Zohan in his home country doing stupid $hit, which is what he does pretty much for the entire movie. As the movie scrapes along, you're pondering what the hell ""Zohan"" is even supposed to be. ""How does he have super powers?"" ""Is he a superhero?"" ""Why the hell am I watching this?"" ""Why does Adam Sandler always have to play the role of a super savvy cool-guy when the only reason anyone really liked ""Happy Gilmore"", ""Billy Madison"", ""Bulletproof"", ""The Wedding Singer"", ""Big Daddy"", ""Little Nicky"", or ""Mr. Deeds"" is because of his supporting cast?"" ""Why can't Adam Sandler play a pedophile addicted to methamphetamines who is married to a retarded homosexual and spends his free time wiping his ass with an American Flag?"" Veiled behind the facade of a retarded accent, a stupid haircut, and a constant beating of dick jokes, narrow minded cultural references, and pretty much anything else that would annoy anyone with a shred of dignity, Zohan expresses aspirations of becoming a hair stylist {in which he will make people s' hair ""silky smooth""(which he repeats at least SEVEN times before the movie ends and you stop wishing to stick your head in an oven for watching this hideous abomination), which is another stupid idiosyncrasy of every single Adam Sandler movie in the past nine years, which is including a ""subtle"" reference to one of his older movies, which the writers apparently think is cute}. After a literal five minute long homosexual joke, he moves to America.Not long after his arrival,(in,...you guessed it... NEW YORK CITY!!!, where every single movie ever made takes place) he finally achieves his goal of becoming a hairstylist. Nearly an hour into the movie, a bit of plot is finally revealed (the time between had to be used as filler for Adam Sandler tea bagging at least twenty different characters and further humiliating himself into oblivion). Zohans' arch enemy, Palestinian terrorist leader Phantom (John Turturro), reveals himself. Apparently, he is also a superhero like Zohan. There are several scenes illogically strewn together depicting Zohan doing some more stupid $hit and further cementing this movie as being the most racist mainstream movie ever made that the American public completely ignores because they're too dense to be able to comprehend anything that isn't expressed explicitly. When there's about a half hour left in the movie (I'm probably not correct on the time frame because I was trying my hardest not to pay attention to the movie for fear that the movie would have pulled me into the depths of insanity, so try to bare with it), Zohan enlists the help of socialite millionaires to aid him in his battle against Phantom. Among these people is Michael Buffer, the famous boxing announcer. I'm still in awe of the throngs of people who were dragged screaming into this fiasco. But I'm still frustrated because of the relentless cameos. Seriously, it is not necessary in any movie. I know that I'm skipping around the plot a bit, but I am trying not to think too much about this movie. At the end of the movie, the Palestinians led by Phantom and the Israelis led by Zohan have an ultra explosion-filled showdown in the streets of New York as the result of some idiotic subplot regarding Rob Schneiders'affinity for his goat (because every single person who lives in the middle east who isn't a terrorist is a goat farmer), some other retarded subplot, and some other retarded subplot. The movie predictably ends with each group realizing their differences and learning to love each other. There. I spoiled the entire movie for you because it really doesn't matter.In the midst of all of the racism, sexism, xenophobia, and pretty much every other idiotic antisocial American sentiment that entrenched this travesty of a film, there is one notion for me that resides over all others. It is the fact that the creators of this movie actually thought that they were making a good movie. To me that is mind boggling. Overall, I give this movie a 2 out of 10 because there were a total of three times when I chuckled at the movie. It's a pretty bad ratio because the movie has to have the record of most attempts at trying to make its audience laugh. However, it was agonizing to watch, so I'll give it a 1 out of spite.",You Don't Mess with the Zohan
205,Egamstk,Not as bad as everyone says.,7,8 June 2008,"While I've never been a -huge- fan of Adam Sandler's films, I have watched them and laughed throughout most of them. I'm the type of guy who enjoys some slapstick, some raunchy humor, and a lot of zanyness.I went into Zohan not expecting anything but pure frivolous humor. You don't go into films like this with any expectations, and I think that's where a lot of the reviewers prior to myself went wrong. They went in expecting to see an evolution of Sandler's humor, and while I would say that Zohan raised the bar a tad, it's still Adam Sandler. Yes, it's going to have a corny ending, a lot of physical humor, and a healthy dose of humor aimed at the more intelligent in the crowd as well.Overall, I couldn't stop giggling, laughing, and chuckling throughout most of the film. After a long streak of not seeing any humor films, I thought it was the perfect thing to bring me back to comedies. The last few years, especially, have been incredibly lackluster in regards to comedies (if that's what evolution of the genre is, count me out, by the way), and I found Zohan refreshing.I think another thing a lot of the other reviewers missed, is that the film in no way expected to take itself seriously. The only serious moments were cheesy, predictable, and ultimately corny, which is irony in itself and only contributed to my bemused chuckling. Yes, a lot of the humor bordered on racial stereotyping, there were a lot of over-the-top accents and allusions to the Middle East, so if you're the type to get touchy about that, feel free to skip. I found it to be a rather hilarious joke on the seriousness that everybody applies to the stereotyping. The stereotyping is, actually, rather fair and towards the end even shows plenty of ""good stereotyping"" (as accurate as stereotyping ever is, which is to say, rarely).Really, the film laughs at itself. Are there some bum moments? Certainly, but it seems that's been the case for almost every film I've seen in the last few years, but it was grand seeing the cast and crew not try to make this the 'next great comedy' and just have a buttload of fun.And if the cast and crew are laughing at themselves (which you can clearly feel through the screen), you can't help but laugh with them.If you want to spend an hour or two snickering and have an open mind, give Zohan a shot. Don't expect an evolution of comedy. Don't expect the bar to be raised, because that's not what this film was trying to do. It was trying to be ridiculous and make people utter that ever so fantastic groaning-giggle followed by the heart chuckle.Don't let the other critics fool you, they've probably forgotten the meaning of the word 'satire'.",You Don't Mess with the Zohan

I've never been an Adam Sandler fan nor detractor.Here's my one criticism. This film is supposed to be a reconciliation between the Jews and Palestinians; ie, we're all the same, we're all looking to be who we want to be, love who we want, and have peace between you and me. However, every major character is played by a Jew. From John Turturro, who I have never liked, to Emmanuelle Chriqui, and Rob Schneider. Why not let the Palestinians be played by Palestinians? If that had occurred, then it would truly have been a we are the same film. Rather than, I'll say we are the same but I'll have all the people who belong to the same church as I play all the parts.

207,todd_4560,Like it for what it is...,7,22 August 2011,"As I've said before like this movie for what it is. Its an Adam Sandler movie. It will have flat on your face goofy jokes and silly comedy and more and more ""toilet humor"" as most people call it. But all this puts more laugh out loud moments than most well written comedies. Its just a fun experience with a light story which actually also tries to address some deep issues. Its not a black comedy. Its just a fun take on some well known facts with some sick fictitious scenarios. Adam Sandler is back with a bang in the roles that make him lovable to a common guy (not to most women) and successful in the industry. Yes, people who know and have seen the other Sandler movies know how good an actor he is. But its just more fun watching him here in these roles. Emmanuelle Chriqui looks really pretty as the lead woman of the movie. Her role might not have much to offer in the acting dept. but I'm not complaining. Special mention to a really good actor in John Turturro as the Phantom. He can adapt to any sort of role and it is clearly visible here. The Phantom fast food chain song really gets a big laugh outta anyone. Multiple screen writers for a movie helps or hurts it. This movie gets a big helping boost to it. I just figure Judd Apatow came up with the big undertone and the others came up with some of the sillier lines. There is no need for this screenplay too be water tight and you will know what I mean once you watch it. Dennis Dugan is like an Adam Sandler regular. He knows what Sandler and the Sandler audience want from the film and he just delivers it to them. Its just a good old Sandler party with the usual suspects.For a fun movie which is light and leaves you with a smile on your face this movie gets a 7/10.",You Don't Mess with the Zohan

It's an Adam Sandler movie not Schindler's list.It's not the greatest flick there ever was, but it did give me a great laugh! So what if the humor is silly? Most of his movies have an ample dosage of silly that I for one thoroughly appreciate! I think Don't Mess with the Zohan is best seen knowing nothing about it and having no expectations.

Yes, it is full of stereotypes but that is what comedy is all about: Exaggerating some parts of peoples personality. Besides, the movie doesn't pick a side with the Jews or the Palestinians, it doesn't insult either side, it even manages to show how the terrorists (whichever side that is) are just misled people who believe they do the right thing.There are a lot of running gags in the movie, the hummus, the faygelah jokes, the fizzy bubbeleh, the goat and more that I can't remember. It doesn't have the best script ever but the jokes keep on coming at a fast rate and the underlying message is a very strong one: We don't HAVE to keep on fighting.If all the extremists in the Middle-East and elsewhere would see this movie perhaps there is still hope because the message of peace in this film is a very strong one.",You Don't Mess with the Zohan
211,piccologenkidama,Not Sandler's Best,4,19 June 2009,"I really wanted to like this movie. I've been an Adam Sandler fan for a long time. Of course, critics have been panning him for years. But his movies have one thing most critical acclaimed comedies forget: Humor. Sandler doesn't take himself seriously, and he's become very good at what he does. So when I say You Don't Mess with the Zohan fell short, it's out of admiration for Sandler's work. The basic premise of You Don't Mess With the Zohan is Adam Sandler's character Zohan's quest to leave behind the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Zohan has been a super-human counter terrorist for years. But he takes the opportunity during a duel with Phantom (John Turturro), his nemesis, to fake his death and escape to America. There Zohan plans to finally realize his dream of being a hair dresser.This is a great starting base for the type of humor Sandler employs. And he doesn't entirely disappoint. There are some great moments, especially involving Sandler's attempts to impress the Palestinian owner Dalia (Emmanuelle Chiriqui) as she makes him work his way up to stylist. Nick Swardson is a pleasant surprise. He's used well as Zohan's first friend in America, and provides some of the best scenes. Dave Matthews is a pleasant surprise in his roll as a redneck (Though I have to add, for a movie about unity and understanding it has no problem turning poor rural whites into racist redneck villains).There's also a lot that doesn't work though. Jokes are extended way too far. It relies a bit too much on ethnic humor. Despite claims otherwise, Sandler's movies usually have great plots that provide the framework for the jokes. This movie lacked that. It was a mess in terms of story and couldn't seem to decide who was the bad guy, until they threw in some hillbillies to mock. The final confrontation has a number of painfully unfunny jokes as well, as if they were running out of gas by the end of the film. It just seems like the same effort that normally goes into Sandler's films is lacking. I have no idea if that's true of course. I'm sure he worked very hard on it. Sometimes it just doesn't come together. You Don't Mess with the Zohan is a great idea . . . and that's all it ever reaches.That said, it's worth watching if you're a fan. It definitely gets back to his style much more so than I Now Pronounce You Chuck and Larry. It just won't be one I'll watch again and again.

212,fightrunner,You don't mess with the Zohan,8,21 August 2008,"Comedy is a subjective genre. One man's Blazing Saddles is another man's Meet the Spartans. Like most other comedians, Adam Sandler polarizes audiences; You either love him or you hate him. His latest offering, you don't mess with the Zohan, will no doubt offend a great many people as he tries to tackle the mountainous topic of the Isreali/Palestinian conflict and create laughs from it.Sandler plays Zohan, a disco-loving Isreali counter-terrorist Action Man. His skills at tackling terrorism border on Super Powers as he catches bullets between his fingers and does flying kicks through solid walls. His big mission is to stop another larger than life villain called The Phantom (John Turturro), but, in his heart, he secretly dreams of leaving the Mossad and starting a new life. A new life in America. As a hairdresser.His plans don't work out straight away though as he is laughed or chased out of each Salon he tries. At the point of giving up, he finds a small Salon owned by a sexy Palestinian chick and begins to live out his dream. Of course, In true Comedy spirit, there's a catch. The building is listed to be torn down to make way for a monstrous new Mall and the Salon is on the brink of closure. Zohan's unique brand of 'Silky Smooth' styling might just pull it back though, as he gains notoriety for giving a little extra service to his customers. Ahem.The film culminates with The Phantom learning Zohan's whereabouts and coming to America to find him, but quickly descends into the mushiest climax you're ever likely to see. Zohan and the Phantom join forces to defeat the Mall developers and everyone makes friends, or to put it another way, Isreal and Palestine put aside their differences to fight American Greed.When the film is funny, it's very funny. Some of the jokes will have you creased with laughter. But, when it's serious it tends to get a bit sourly sweet, like the ending outlined above. It really excels when it's showing Zohan's Fish-out-of-water antics. For Example, he quiets a noisy child by giving a Vulcan style sleeper grip to the neck.Initially the poor accents from Sandler and the supporting cast do grate, but you quickly get used to them. Hats off to Rob Scheider in his obligatory cameo as a Palestinian Farmer cum New York Taxi Driver. He manages to evoke some sympathy despite being the most annoying actor in Hollywood.|'m going to recommend Zohan because as an Adam Sandler comedy vehicle it works perfectly.

218,SatanicMushrooms,Don't waste your money.,4,2 April 2009,"Adam Sandler has built himself a reputation of starring in movies which feature the same rinse-and-repeat plot structure; A misfit with no meaningful future discovers X (X being the key to the plot), has a ball, then has a self-realization moment that either: a) His life sucks b) He'll lose X or c) He won't get laid, then he changes, beats the bad guy, and throws in a few laughs into the mix, making us leave the cinema having laughed ourselves silly or slightly dead on the inside knowing we were cheated out of the price of a movie ticket.Sadly, Zohan does not fit into this category, Sandler takes on a different tact; A plot line so outrageously stupid it's attempted to be passed off as a random sort of humor. Even by ""Sandler Standards"" (that is, low standards), the acting in this movie is just...awful.

I gave this movie a 3 and not worse because out side of the disgusting sex scenes, the movie had a lot of very funny parts. This had great potential between the story and non-sick jokes to be a a great movie. The special effects were very good (and funny) too. BTW we loved Happy Gilmore and The Waterboy.

I suppose if you liked those two movies you would be in for a treat with this one.Spoiler: The movie also had a deeper meaning, going into the Middle-Eastern conflict--however, it was a little too convenient to blame the problems on a corporation rather than on their ancestors and religions.

221,Archblood,Making Love The Zohan Way,7,22 June 2008,"Note: At the personal risk that I have not catch lots of Adam Sandler flicks (the ones I had already gone through are 'Anger Management' and 'Click'), I believe my review on 'Zohan' will, no doubt, cater much to the interest of cinema goers who are in a similar situation as mine. Or else, you probably never bother to catch his flicks at all. Never mind. I hope to make this article my honest and unbiased view on the movie.For the professional followers of Adam Sandler, I'm sorry if this review kinda stinks in your taste. Still, enjoy.....Adam Sandler's latest comedic adventure sees him playing as an oversexed Israeli commando who possessed superhuman abilities to kick through walls and dodge bullets at point blank range. For pleasure, he loves to be in the nude whenever the moment calls for it and likes to demonstrate his amazing talent in hacky sack. All these indeed makes his character, Zohan Dvir, a stereotypical Middle Eastern Jew armed with over-the-top antics and mannerism in a comedy heavily loaded with slapstick humour and outrageous moments.The story so goes that after a few years serving the military, Zohan (better known as 'The Zohan' by his enthusiastic pal, Uri), increasingly weary of a life with the Israeli Defence Force, faked his own death following a comical showdown with his arch nemesis, Phantom (John Turturro), a notorious Palestinian terrorist. When the ruse works, he made his great escape to New York where he took the corny alias 'Scrappy Coco' and embarked on an journey of a lifetime to realize his greatest aspiration: to be a world class hairstylist in the USA.When his attempt to work in a high end saloon eventually failed, Zohan ended up in the employment of sexy Palestinian-American hairdresser, Dhalia (Emmanuelle Chriqui) whose shop is located in a Middle Eastern neighbourhood where Arabs and Israeli-descent Jews co-exists under a fragile state of peace. Thus began Zohan's hairstylist career as he gave raunchy hair care and ferocious sex to his mostly elderly female clients.Zohan is your typical kind of comedy where the antagonist largely depends on the glossiest of humour to support the structure of the story.While the usual slapsticks, courtesy of Sandler, is the sell, the film also make racial references to Middle-Easterners and Jews, mainly the problematic differences between the two races. Such scenes is an obvious reflection of the ongoing conflicts in their respective motherland but even as the message can get political at times (with occasional mentions and sequences involving terrorism and racial hate and even a series of scenes that seem to suggest that the blame's on the greedy white men of corporate US), it does not go too serious and addresses the issues in a rather cheap humour delivery.One can say that the movie is actually a satirizing metaphor which attempts to carry a reconciling message about brotherly love that knows no boundaries. Needless conflicts can be laughed off as a matter of childish squanders.Despite the real life inspirations, the story could do with a lot of improvement though it's not some thing you can expect much from a slapstick comedy. As for the jokes, it is a tolerable case of excessive sexual innuendos and stupidity. It can get quite bland as time passes but at least some of it can keep you entertained due to the wit or just the sheer senselessness of it all.Not forgetting the titled character of the flick whom Sandler had successfully brought with so much cartoony life and energy. Zohan is one man who probably believes he is the ultimate sex machine (having a bloaty crotch underneath his tight pants) with shameless confidence to 'satisfy' women, old enough to be his mum. His gigolo antics is blatantly fearless as demonstrated in one hair washing scene where he caressed a client's heavily soaked hair with his tongue. Such moments can either put you off or just make you laugh the hell out of it. It sure challenge my imagination in some way.The roster of the other characters are also racial stereotypes , including Rob Schneider's part as a bitter taxi driver whose goat was snatched away by a unkind Zohan some years back in the Middle East. Emmanuelle's Dhalia with her 'Get serious and no goofing around' attitude is an expected cliché which sets her up to be won over by the highly flamboyant Zohan. Michael Buffer is Walbrigde, an evil magnate who wanted to pull down Dhalia's neighbourhood to make way for a future mega mall. There are also cameo appearances involving Kevin James ('Doug' from King Of Queens), Mariah Carey and tennis bad boy, John McEnroe.Overall, Zohan is a movie that might not be appreciated by many, especially by those who have been following on Adam Sandler. It is subjective, on the part of deciding how good it actually gets especially when professional critics had lauded the comedy as rubbish while respected reviewer Roger Ebert had given it a '3 out of 4 stars' grading. This is a flick that at is best, will be remembered for its funny portrayal of Middle Eastern subjects or at worst, one of Sandler's flops in possible nomination for a Razzie.",You Don't Mess with the Zohan
222,TrippGlambert,Offensive and Silly,4,23 June 2008,"Before I review this film I just want to tell you, I'm not of of those people. Those people that go to movies like this just to write about how stupid they were, I enjoy some silly light hearted movies, I love a good Sandler comedy but this was just plain bad.I kind of knew Zohan would be bad inside but I still wanted to see it, I loved Little Nicky even though critics trashed that. So I thought Zohan might be quite misunderstood as well. Boy! I was wrong. You Don't Mess With the Zohan was a shoddy and obnoxious attempt at a comedy movie. It is utterly silly and tries to get you with shock factor but ends up being just plain weird. It gets a four because while it mostly reeks of bad, it still has some good jokes in it, the beginning to film promises a very odd and refreshing new comedy and the first 5 minutes will tickle your spine. But then it just gets odder and odder - to a point where it's almost unwatchable and through this try hard weirdness it still produces some lovable Sandler comedy. And while rear, the occasional joke is very laughable.The plot seems promising, but totally fails on content. It wanders to far from the plot and ends up to be so silly it's offensive, it's tries to throw random jokes out like Family Guy. It fails miserably and in result is a very messy, unco-ordinated film. Plus it's completely stereotypes Middle Eastern people. It's like the writers didn't get the memo that everyone is now supposed to be equal. And for overseas people watching, it completely reverses America's efforts to appear more open minded and equal.In summary, Zohan is while occasionally funny, 99% of the time a very messy, silly, outrageous (not in a good way) film.

Pretty good, but there's something missing - that one missing ingredient in this boiling pot of cinematic calamity.And in Zohan, Adam Sandler appears to have found that one component required for this perfect storm of bad movie-making to occur - racist jokes. The vast majority of ""jokes"" in Zohan consist of little more than ""Jews are penny-pinching cheats"" or ""Arabs are poor, stupid goat herders"". What little characterisation anyone who is not Adam Sandler gets is either ""hummus-eating weirdo"" (Israeli) or ""angry cab-driving terrorist"" (Palestinian).The plot is abandoned relatively fast in favour of Zohan having sex with lots of old ladies, and a nonsensical climax involving Mariah Carey shamelessly plugging her album.

Yes, it's a quintessential Adam Sandler comedy, and that is certainly not everyone's cup of tea. At the same time, Zohan is a marvelous parody about the life of Samson. Instead of dealing with the ancient Judge of the Israelites directly, the film modernizes Samson as Zohan, a virile Massad super soldier. Zohan is portrayed as an imperfect yet extraordinary soldier who can perform amazing physical feats. His Palestinian nemesis, Fatoush, is not unlike Goliath the Philistine. Zohan sports long hair, but the issue of hair is not as simple as keeping it uncut. Instead, Zohan dreams of a peaceful life in which he can work as a hairdresser. Let me give the writers a high five: Too funny!! Zonhan falls for Dalia, a modern Palenstinian version of Delilah.

Rob Schnieder is in it and is even funnier than his role in water boy and all other roles combined! John Tuturo is the arch rival of Sandler in the film, and is very funny. Of all the Sandler films, I rate this one as his best, with water boy a close second. I would even add a star if you are from NY or California where the stereotypes in the movie are very realistic.

In my opinion, Adam Sandler came across as a bit of a Borat-wannabe, just not as good. Maybe he wasn't actually aiming at that, but you couldn't help see the similarities. Apart from that, there was a lot of preachy stuff about racial harmony between Jews and Arabs.

First of all, I am not a massive Adam Sandler fan but he has made some pretty funny movies. This one is, I would say the best yet, even better than Happy Gilmore. Myself and my friends from work have had a great time this week quoting lines from this film ""smell it, smell it ..... now take it!"" and ""no, no, not the pee pee...... the bush, I have a very large bush!"" and ""thank you for calling the Hezbollah terrorist hotline"" have become particularly popular. This is a consistently funny movie from start to finish. More chuckle all the way through than side splitting, but there are several genuine laugh out loud moments. Sandler and John Turturo are both brilliant and the cameos from Macenroe and Mariah Carey are also worthwhile. To summarise, do not be put off by the IMDb rating - this will continue to go up and up as more people see this, or the story line (an Isreali counter terrorist who leaves to follow his dream of becoming a hairdresser in New York?) which does sound stupid.Go see the film if you need a good laugh - take some friends and have a good night out and a great few weeks afterwards quoting lines from the film.

245,Bido16,To this movie makers  thank you.,9,14 April 2009,"To comment on this movie, there are two main sides: First one would be Adam Sandler, I have always liked his movies, for the light kind of comedy he presents, you watch and you laugh but you don't expect to come out of the movie with a deeper message or something remotely philosophic to think about, I find that when Adam Sandler tries to go deep, his movies become quite depressing and nonsensical, ""Click"" quickly comes to mind.The thing about the Zohan, is that I laughed a lot in some parts, but I find his affairs with the older ladies to be a bit repetitive and leaning towards downright BORING. Also the crude language and the oh-too-much ""crotch"" view makes it quite impossible to let your kids watch the movie, which is a pity, because I find the hilarious fight scenes and the Zohan's ""supernatural"" cool stunts would have been fun for kids to watch.Second point of view would be from an Arab point of view; I started watching this movie, preparing myself to get offended, and mind you I am a very broad minded person ... However, I was pleasantly surprised, for the first time in my life I see a movie that does not picture Arabs as animal-like, heartless, brainless killing machines. They are just people, trying to make a living, even the avenging one has a reason, the Zohan stole his goat.Watching this movie, I tried to forget that I am an Arab, and I see that it is portraying - in a very silly and somehow inaccurate way - two opposing sides, and suggesting that they stop fighting, get over their differences to see that they are in fact similar.The movie makers get my personal ""thank you"" for that, it is no different than watching a movie about the conflict between ""black"" and ""white"" people after the civil war, or about Americans and Japanese directly after WWII, there is no prejudices against Arabs here.For the very first time, someone has discovered that Arabs are human beings too.

I even tried to make myself laugh out of respect for Happy Madison but it just would't happen. The movie was filled with useless ""pee-pee"" jokes that were boring and pointless.

The only thing I can say that I took away was the point of how Israel and Palestine could actually come together to make amends in the battles being fought for so long. Sandler needs to do a lot of soul searching before he decides to put out another movie, especially a comedy, and get back to his roots to make us all laugh again.

They just wouldn't understand most of the jokes.

He could have a really great career if he just stopped acting in the movies he produces. If you really love sandler, do what is best for him stop seeing his movies in the theater. You are enabling his self-destructive tendencies.I just saw this thing. It was a free screening, and it was at a theater that is about 2 miles from my house, so it only cost me about nine cents in gas to get there. I still think I was ripped off. I went to see this movie because I had nothing to do, and besides these movies are never as bad as they look in the trailer (except for chuck and larry which managed to be worse). I do have to admit that I did laugh one time in this movie, I don't remember what I laughed at but it was toward the end of this nearly 2 HOUR movie. I blame the fact that I was in a weakened state after having been hit over the head with about a thousand racial jokes, 142 shots of sandler's padded crotch, and a surprisingly restrained 43 jokes about sandler screwing elderly women.

It might be silly, but it demystifies all the ""glory"" of war and religious superiority.

There were a few good jokes, but I would just laugh for a few seconds where I would then be bombarded with joke after joke that was not necessarily dumb, but did not make me laugh.In conclusion, I would say go see it, so you can have your own opinion of it.

As crazy as it seems, I think it's possible to buy into Zohan (Sandler) wanting to be a hairdresser and all of that It's silly but also weirdly charming.But, unfortunately, there seems to be a really OTT spoofy style being employed most of the time... As, there were many moments that were ALMOST really entertaining/fun- but then something absurd would always happen to spoil the tone.I can be objective about most things though, so I'm able to say 'okay, fine, this film isn't really for me' It's just too self-consciously zany and undisciplined for my tastes.What illustrates the shortcomings more clearly, I think, is that I would happily recommend Happy Gilmore to people I would also have no shame endorsing Big Daddy or the original Deuce Bigalow (and some other Happy Madison produced films) I really think this film is a little 'off' though It's cheesy and OTT in a way that makes it less appealing than it ought to be So yeah, a shame IMO, but I guess if some people enjoyed it (a few people here apparently did) then I'm glad to hear that.

261,elkster888,Critics dislike another hilarious Sandler movie!,6,7 June 2008,"You Don't Mess with the Zohan is a very stupid, but hilarious comedy about an Israeli soldier who becomes a hairdresser. The Zohan (Sandler) is very sexual with the women in the salon, giving the audience huge laughs. This was the first movie I have heard people actually clap after numerous jokes. There is no way that the critics did not laugh during this movie and therefore should not be so hard on Sandler (who was possibly the funniest he's been). There are tons of very funny cameos and appearances as well. Although this movie went on for 15 minutes too long, it is positively worth seeing!

262,ceesotnas15,what is with the disturbing accent and foul language?,3,24 July 2008,"It is sooo not adam sandler...lolz...anyway, here's my viewpoint of the movie:I should admit that at the beginning to the middle of the movie, everything has been incredibly funny. But as similar to all those trying hard comedy movies, this one strived to maintain the funny environment till the very last second and frame. Midway to the end, everything has become repetitively boring and dull with shallow plot and ridiculous sequences. But then, this movie is a very brave move for Adam Sandler. Having been a supporter, I know that his strength is with love-comedy-family conflicting stories. This one is totally different and out of line so I give him praise for that one. However, being brave and successful are two different things. This movie of his, I should say, is not as memorable and entertaining as his other movies such as 50 first dates, the wedding singer, click, and reign over me. The voice and the accent are very disturbing (I actually think that this ruined everything). The foul language is at the same time not soooo funny. Having intercourse with matured and old women in front of their offspring or in public places. God, what is happening in this planet? I couldn't imagine what more hideous things/ideas comedy movie creators are going to exaggerate to increase movie profit. Then, it kind of gives the impression of racial discrimination over middle-eastern most specially with the voice, the behavior, the terrorism, it is full of it everywhere. Anyway, the leading girl is gorgeous and is for me one of the people who made the movie bearable to watch till the end. Mariah Carey's appearance is as well a big surprise. But as I have initially said, the climax up to the ending is so dull and non-artistic. Now, whether you should watch it out depends on how bored and capable you are of enduring nonsense, less imaginative film production. As for me, I just didn't like it.",You Don't Mess with the Zohan
263,amon-andros,Leave your brains out of the theatre and enjoy the movie,6,9 June 2008,"First of all the film lacks logic- no matter how hard you try to think. This movie might embarrass Superman that he cannot do stuff Zohan can, but, that doesn't mean this is a bad movie. Its one of those movies you would be laughing your heads off and come out of the theater with a ""I have no idea what happened in there"" kinda feeling. The storyline is way too predictable, the jokes are too crude (if your girlfriend doesn't appreciate such humor, its more enjoyable to go watch it with other guys) and many of the scenes are totally senseless. But if you wanna go see the movie, go for it. You will enjoy it only if you go there to see a comedy flick and not attend a science seminar. Here Adam Sandler starring as Zohan is part of the Israeli army with super-human abilities. He is called in to capture a Palestinian terrorist named Phantom whom Zohan had caught previously, but is let off because of a Israel-Palestine trade. But Zohan is sick of killing and considers himself as an artist, one who wants to cut hair the Paul Mitchell way. He fakes his accident and escapes to the States to become a hair-dresser only to find out that it is not going to be a cake-walk. He finally starts working at a Israel-Palestine neighborhood hair-saloon. From here the movie is better to watch than to read. If you ask why 6/10- its the ending. The filmmakers have stretched their imagination way too far and opened up too many variables in the end which makes a predictable ending too long, too goofy and too boring. In short this movie is not going anywhere close to Oscar awards, but its a good 2 hours of fun. Some might call it gross comedy or cheap comedy, but its comedy nonetheless.",You Don't Mess with the Zohan

After watching this movie I have lost all respect for Adam Sandler. After being a fan of his since his early movies this one has really let him down. Why would he make a movie like this was he desperate for money or something? It was not funny at all the attempts at humor were very weak and I did not laugh once. In all honesty I could not wait for it to end and was close to asking for my money back. A total waste of time anyone who is thinking of going to watch this movie should go and see something that is actually worth watching. The only people who were laughing was the box office when they were taking my money to see such a poor movie I really do not know how this made the cinema in my opinion should have not made it even straight to DVD.,You Don't Mess with the Zohan

However, it was lacking in the subplot category.Rob Schneider, as much as I love him in doses, was too much and too little at the same time. But it's made up for with great jokes, and awesome whit. The mother, the awesome slow motion montages of old women getting it on, the over packed buldge, The Mariah Carey shirts, the HUMMUS!

267,a-reinheimer,Stupid Liberal Drivel...,2,6 February 2010,"This film reeks of the typical Hollywood drivel that comes under the rubric of ""if we all dropped our prejudices, we could all get along just fine."" Of course, Sandler and friends make sure to drive this stupid message into the script of this film endless times... Of course, the conflict in the Middle East is not between silly Jews and silly Arabs, as the film would have it. Rather, it is between a anti-Semitic genocidal Arabs who are seeking to destroy the Jewish homeland and a people building one of the most decent and advanced societies in the world. The Israelis are not Arab haters, though, without question, there is plenty to dislike about Arab culture, they are wary of those who are trying to destroy the Jewish state by any means necessary-- including the creation of that biggest hoax of all the, so called, ""palestinian nation"" or ""people."" Every time uninformed Jews like Sandler gives credence to this hoax by mentioning the name ""palestinian"" as a legitimate entity, they do a major disservice, not only to the cause of Justice, but to the historical record. Another thing, Sandler and many of the other actors, including John Turturro, do terrible accents (Israeli / Arabic respectively). Of course, it is likely that they purposely mangled the accents to further the film's liberal message... However, it is almost never funny to do something poorly, this concept is overwhelmingly true in the realm of comedy. All that aside, this film does have a few funny parts, buried in an endlessly stupid script. These should just be culled up into a 5 minute clip and posted on YouTube. It would be the only worthwhile thing to do with a film such as this.",You Don't Mess with the Zohan

It is absolutely not like many other (admittedly dull) Sandler movies but has a real message below the surface. And the actors all really give a great performance.There is of course a lot of slapstick action and excessive goofiness, but more important is how the movie makes use of these elements to show how absurd the hate between Palestinians and Israelis really is.I think the point is that you can only really get this movie if you have been to Israel a couple of times, due to the many innuendos to Israeli life. It may also help to get more of the comedy if you know a little Hebrew or Yiddish. But then it's a real treat.Truth is, that I never laughed my ass off like this watching any other movie.And the music by one of my favorite Israeli bands, Hadag Nahash, puts the dot on the ""i"" for me in this movie and wins the 10th out of 10 points for my vote.",You Don't Mess with the Zohan

271,HammerDoc,"Great Talents and Gifts, Abused",2,15 July 2009,"I would like to point out that I think Adam Sandler is a great comedic and acting talent. He has displayed it before. (""50 First Dates"" comes to mind.) However, it is a shame that he abuses his talents so effusively and intolerably as he does in this movie.With the talents involved, this should have been a much greater movie. In my opinion, even its frequent laughs and its flirting with an admirable ""Dropping of old hatreds/Peace in the Middle East"" theme, are not enough to redeem the serious base impurities in which this movie is so thoroughly steeped.The movie's premise is rich with promise: THE premiere, elite Israeli commando fakes his own death in order to pursue his dream of becoming a peaceful hairdresser of all things! The premise itself is worthy of a good laugh. This caricature is largely well executed and, considered independently from the movie's flaws, exhibits a great comedic ability on the part of Mr. Sandler and others responsible for it.Unfortunately, the movie is also rampant with extreme, at times graphic, impurity and the banal scatological (bathroom) humor worthy of the most anal obsessive 8 year-old. This style of humor unfortunately drowns out the far greater and more enjoyable humor of which Adam Sandler is capable, and even periodically displays in this movie.Furthermore, the sexual mores (actually, the lack thereof) in this movie are EXECRABLE. The title character literally humps everything that moves in this movie (and a few things that don't). Unfortunately, this statement is not a hyperbole.No character in this movie, male or female, seems to care—despite being completely aware—that the Zohan is having sex with LITERALLY every woman who will hold still long enough. Even though at one point the Zohan flirts with the idea of monogamy, no one has enough dignity in their own person to even MAKE NOISES at requiring monogamy with them.All religious standards aside: Are those who made this move COMPLETELY unaware of the rampant AIDS, hepatitis and other STD epidemics that have swept the world in the last 40-50 years since the sexual revolution? I am no prude. In fact, as a Catholic Christian, I see and understand sexuality within marriage to be a GREAT gift from God. As a physician I see and deal with a full range of human behaviors every day. Unfortunately I also have to deal daily with the consequences of my patients' misbehaviors, frequently the misuses of the gift of sexuality. I help patients deal with the ramifications of these abuses on a daily basis as well. This movie is downright irresponsible in this regard, EVEN IF one takes the sexual misbehaviors of its characters as a hyperbole.An aside here, to Lainie Kazan and Charlotte Rae—WHAT WERE YOU THINKING (?) when you took your parts in this movie! How far have you fallen?! Shame on you! You are both far, FAR better than this. Stop it!",You Don't Mess with the Zohan
272,wktvahey,Disappointment (Spoilers for those who care),3,11 April 2008,"Adam Sandler has hit or miss movies and this one was a big MISS for me. Just so you get a feel for the ones I liked or tolerated (Punchdrunk Love, Spanglish, The Wedding Singer, 50 First Dates, Big Daddy, Click). Ones I disliked (Billy Madison, Happy Gilmore, The Waterboy, Chuck & Larry, Little Nicky).If you're into potty jokes and unsophisticated sexual humor, this might be your kind of movie, because there's plenty of it. I'm surprised this is probably getting a PG-13 rating. Some of the jokes in the movie worked and were genuinely funny, but for the most part, Zohan was raunchy with low-brow sexual jokes galore. If you take out the vulgar sexual jokes, you don't have much of a movie and probably lose about 30-45 minutes of footage, which would scale this movie down to about 45 minutes and could be shown as an hour long TV special with 15 minutes of ads.I saw several people walk out during the screening of this movie and I personally felt inclined to follow their lead but only stayed in my seat in hopes that the movie would redeem itself with a better outcome. Man, what a letdown. I went with 3 other friends. 3 of us hated it and 1 of my friends just thought it was tolerable.**SPOILERS** He's an Israeli anti terrorist who is the best at what he does, on a super human level. The movie opens with a hacky sack sequence where he uses his bare ass to catch the sack and the camera shows it too. I did not need to see that. A more subtle camera angle that could have implied what happened would have been more tasteful, but then again, there's no accounting for tastes in this movie. You see him banging old women in the hair salon he works in and he even has sex with the mother of his newfound friend. The humor is so over the top that my suspension of disbelief hit a wall. Mariah Carey makes a cameo as herself in the movie, and the scenes with her in it work for the most part, but they could have used a fictitious celebrity and it would not have changed the outcome of the humor. There are ethnic jokes and jokes about racial tension in the Middle East that just don't work very well because of the current situation. Lots of jokes with hummus also don't work. The only one that got a laugh out of me was when Zohan's father dipped his eyeglasses in hummus to eat.",You Don't Mess with the Zohan

So, knowing of these events, the movie has become much, much more funny, with a nice friendly theme of everyone getting on together and immigrants can live happily ever after in America being a main theme. Besides this, the film was hilarious, being so politically incorrect and stereotypical that you will be laughing your head off.

For me this is up there with Sandler's best titles such as Little Nicky However that's not to say that this is a movie for everyone. If you watch this movie expecting anything more than a good laugh (or classy jokes) then you're going to be disappointed.

I went in expecting nothing, as I had a couple of hours to kill, and it was the next film starting. It's such a pleasure to come across a movie such as this, that you think will be rubbish and turns out to be both satirical and hysterical.The premise has been written on lots of reviews here so I don't need to go over it again. The movie is essentially a sex comedy - a crass comedy - a political satire - a superhero movie - and a Capra-esquire fantasy about not giving up on your dreams, all rolled into one! And boy does it work! All the performances are beautifully nuanced; I particularly liked Alec Mapa as Claude the hairdresser, and Rob Schneider is hilarious as the Arab taxi driver trying to make a living anyway he can.But this is Adam Sandler's show, and his performance as The Zohan was sexier than anything George Clooney or Brad Pitt could achieve on screen. He's a total babe! How come we never noticed this before?

And with Adam Sandler doing a Disney film later this year, you know that his career is going to eventually fall. As did Ice Cube, Martin Lawerence, Eddie Murphy..and now John Travolta.

The slapstick type stuff was so good that I didn't even recognize it as slapstick - even though I hate that type of stuff with a passion.Comedies usually get underrated since they can't suit everyone's tastes, but I won't overrate it to try and artificially raise it's rating.

Like the superhero actions of him, and all that kind of stuff, I mean, okay its funny but at an certain point it gets too much.

For the most part I found the overall concept a even a bit off putting. The conflict in Israel and Palestine is not exactly a good basis for humor. Nonetheless the Zohan character lacks charm or even basic character. OK so he is an assassin who has a heart and wants to be a hairdresser, I get it. Real funny. No not really there was nothing endearing about Zohan and his proclivity for sex with any women regardless of their age.Zohan was basically an arrogant jerk. To me a good comedy has to have a lead character you identify with or want to identify with. I did not even like Zohan. So this movie was like being forced to spend 90 minutes with an annoying idiot.Along with all the other slap stick gags either already done or so incredibly banal that they should not be done,not much in this movie to really rave about. In fact I don't even remember how it ends,yes that memorable.Actually after sitting through this movie I could not wait for it to end.As well myself and the two friends I watched it with agree that Sandlers thick but badly done accent actually drew away from whatever punchlines he was delivering. In fact the rapid fire exchanges between Zohan and his nemesis near the end of the movie had me wishing I had turned on the subtitles.Many people stated that The Love Guru has possibly sunk Mike Myers career. I would like to state that Zohan SHOULD sink Sandlers career. What a waste of a movie rental this was.This movie stinks.Avoid unless you want to lose all respect for Adam Sandler.",You Don't Mess with the Zohan

I found it a little silly but, if you know Adam Sandler and his humour you will love this. A great film !! This was one of the funniest films I've seen for ages, right from the beginning through to the end, there were no boring parts. The story of the film itself is slightly preposterous, and there are some cringe-worthy moments, but this is to be accepted with an Adam Sandler comedy and must be taken in the spirit of the film. Overall I would say do not expect too much from this film, and you will have a great laugh. Only went too see the film because of Adam sandler but no matter how bad the plot is he always makes it good and that he did.

292,celticwords,"Why, oh Why Did you Do it Adam?",1,10 June 2008,"I love Adam Sandler. He has put out some of the funniest and unique movies in his time. And his recent foray into drama has shown that there is a real actor underneath it all that can shock us, just as we thought he was in a set stereotype.But this film lacks any real enjoyment, content or worthiness of showing on the screen. It is utterly tasteless and without any redeemable quality. It is full of random appearances from Sandler's friends in the film business, which make it a who's who of talents...but still it is all lost in the mediocrity that is going on.After watching an hour of the same joke done over and over and over again, you start to wonder if they just ran out of things to write about on page two and just kept writing to stretch it out. The worst was the unnecessary and vulgar male nudity seen throughout, and up close shots of a large, protruding cod-piece. Not to mention, the constant banging of old women.I tried to stick it out and kept hoping it would redeem itself and get better in the end...but after two hours I was just ready for it to end and get it over with. It is definitely one of those films that I will tell everyone to stay away from and will avoid when it comes to DVD.

It's about as ""racist"" as any other comedy movie about any other race, religion, etc. (did the previews not give any of this away?)If you're conservative you probably don't watch movies in that genre anyway... this one is also probably not for you.

Since Happy Gilmore, I think his humor is really good, enough to clear your mind with a nice couple of laughs. But this, is definitely not Sandler, I mean the film is full of totally senseless parts, totally, maybe the producers thought that putting more than 10 senseless scenes on it would make the film hilarious, or to think ""is so senseless that it makes me laugh"", well no, there is a couple of funny scenes, but that's it. I've read a couple of reviews about this film stating that if you're into an Adam Sandler film then you should go for it, but really, this is not Adam Sandler's style, NOT. I would consider Sandler's style films like Chuck & Larry, or Happy Gilmore, or Anger Managment, that's the sort of humor he really has, but not this, it is TOTALLY SENSELESS, truly.One of the worst comedies in years.

I won't necessarily watch a movie because of the actors because I don't do that. I watch a movie for one reason... I want to be ENTERTAINED! That is all! And guess what? This movie ACTUALLY delivered! I had my doubts at first because I initially thought this was going to be a boring, brain-dead movie as it looks and sounds like one. And that's weird because it actually isn't. It is entertaining and funny, but in an unusual way. Zohan is, from the beginning, a very likable character as he has a bubbly, fun, strong and honourable personality with a side of softness. He's tired of violence and instead searches for life of peace. His sworn enemy - Phantom - is also a very fun, likable character full of life. Apart from that, all the other characters are 'ok' but don't necessarily play a big role in the movie. That's all it really needs to be a great, entertaining movie with a destiny to please you. Two great, likable, funny, weird and lively characters. The plot is nothing special as its simple and doesn't really go anywhere. But the characters along the way make up for this with just being them. They have very realistic personalities and love to goof around. The movie grabs you, slaps you across the face, takes you away from reality and pulls you in to just have a laugh! It's a fun movie! It's not AMAZING or SPECIAL or INFLUENTIAL or a MASTERPIECE. NO! IT'S JUST FUN, ENTERTAINING AND STUPID! A must watch comedy if you just want to laugh... That's all. 7/10",You Don't Mess with the Zohan

This ruins the comedy of the film by demonstrating that it's OK to be cruel to animals. The plot is interesting enough; the scenes with animals just aren't needed. I don't even understand why that would be funny. They are also recurring in the film - If you are a cat lover, like myself, please be warned about the 'hacky sack' scenes which although are mild, can also be quite upsetting. disappointed in this film as those parts ruined it for me.

I thought this movie was absolutely awful and I'll tell you why. Sandler has always thought that having little old ladies talking/acting sexy is really funny. A lot of his movies have a little bit of that in them (the maid in Billy Madison, for example.) This movie goes completely overboard with that theme and I think it is really degrading and disrespectful and not at all funny. I think the point of showing old women sexually is so young guys who fantasize about Victoria Secret models can laugh and be repulsed by the idea of an older woman wanting to have sex. Like I said, it's degrading to these woman and so completely not funny. And even worse, in this movie, all the old women are so grateful and happy to have the attentions of this repulsive guy. Barf.Also, the humor in this movie is far too focused on the genitals and rear end. I have nothing against penises, I just don't think they are hilariously funny just because they exist.I'm sure others will disagree but I think, for the most part, this movie is aimed at young men and others won't find it very funny.",You Don't Mess with the Zohan

I recommend this to all Sandler fans its easy to watch, will make you laugh though it is certainly not stimulating on the brain and is definitely not up there with Sandler's best like Happy Gilmore and Big Daddy.

The reason it is is because one of the jokes is where they are screaming as loud as they can in opera and that just destroys everything on the block and the movie and I even saw people walk out of the movie and laughing when there was no joke and when one happened they stopped and yawned and the only funny parts were on the trailer and thats it throughout my eyes were drooping and I was about to fall asleep the only reason I stayed is because I hoped it would get better and better but it just got worse and worse.

What was Sandler thinking? I hope he returns to the form of films such as Happy Gilmore, but after this stinker it's highly unlikely.It reminded me a lot of the love guru, I can't decide which film was worse. They both had lame characters with awful accents and unintelligible story lines.This could have been a funny film if they had dropped the PG rating and given it the crudeness that it only hinted at.

The crude humor with or without sexual undertones and some excellent sequences would keep tickling your funny bones. Hezbollah helpline and 'going out of business' shops are a some of the corny, yet entertaining pieces.Not that everything would make sense all the time or it's always original, but the scenes would keep up with the tone of the movie without letting you bother of hows and whys.

This movie is a comedy and it stars Adam Sandler if you walk into that theater expecting anything except a stupid-funny movie then you need to instead leave the theater to go home and hit yourself in the face with a rock, after all it can't do more damage to your brain. In the most simple of terms this movie stars Adam Sandler if you do not find him and his over the top antics funny then I would delicately suggest that you do not see his movies as I understand they are not for everyone. To preempt any whining from people saying that ""Other Adam Sandler films made me laugh but this one was not the same"" let me remind you that the movie you just saw was called You Don't Mess with the Zohan NOT Happy Gilmore. If you walked into this theater expecting to see Happy Gilmore then again let me remind you that you can actually buy Happy Gilmore on DVD and also there is a rock at home for your face. NEWSFLASH! Movies do have differences from one another and thank heavens they do or the only Adam Sandler movie we would ever have is Happy Gilmore recycled over and over. Finally and perhaps most important of all this movie was never intended to somehow explain or even explore the difficult and tense situation in the Middle East it was not even necessarily supposed to poke fun at it. This movie was supposed to make you laugh. If you laughed and had a good time then who cares? Everyone in the theater with me was laughing through the movie and having a good time.

It was fantastic- The light hearted love story and can't we all get along message was handled appropriately and provided a sufficient vehicle to carry the rest of the story along= and that is so typical Sandler- think Waterboy.The Smigal parts were hilarious- the women were dripping gorgeous- and for one clown here who had a problem with a cat scene-if you couldn't catch the homage to Steve Martin's Cat juggling bit- then just hang up your film viewing license- This was a great film and you should run out and see it this summer- in the theater- where movies are meant to be seen!

During this break we flipped the coin of fate again to decide if we would bother going back in. I hate that coin, we ended up watching the rest of the film.I like Adam Sandler normally, 50 First Dates, Click, and Chuck and Larry were all good films, but Zohan was really really bad in my opinion. At some points i had to read the dutch subtitles to understand what was being said as the accents they were using made the dialog difficult to hear properly.There are 2 or 3 funny bits in the film, but this is another case of if you have seen the trailer, you have seen all the funny bits.I am a big believer that if you know what to expect from a film before you see it, then it shouldn't disappoint.

But the majority of the movie was about Zohan ""sexing"" his elderly clients.

I love how the Zohan and the Phantom, when they are fighting in that one scene, they are arguing about that one little thing.Its also great that he dreams to be a hairdresser but he is a guy. That shows that both genders can do it. 10/10!!",You Don't Mess with the Zohan

This is gonna have to be the one I have to shun people away from. My first thoughts before going in were, ""Oh, that Adam Sandler with his funny accents and even funnier hair cut..."" I even expected the straight-up silly. The outrageous characters and forthcoming numerous gags were worth admission.However far back I pushed my sense of disbelief and plausibility of these characters was shot back a little over an hour into it when it got political. Namely jokes against Mel Gibson. How am I supposed to take something satirical about tolerance of others seriously when it numerously stabs at someone who made a mistake, apologized, and has taken steps to right their wrong? And I'm supposed to laugh when the true bad guy, the American racist-redneck, believes Mel Gibson ""gets him"".The fact that these filmmakers think it's evil not to vote for Obama or Hillary is what takes away the potential this film had. It contradicts itself and what America truly is. And we wonder why people around the world won't take us seriously.On the other hand, any time Emmanuelle Chriqui or Mariah Carey are on screen is worth not digging into the bottom of your large tub of popcorn to watch.",You Don't Mess with the Zohan

329,southsider2000,Hair Pollution,1,28 May 2008,"You know, sometimes I just don't understand what the heck is going through Adam Sandler's head. He's a funny guy with natural charisma and, I would guess, a reasonable level of intelligence. So why does he feel compelled to write and produce films of such appallingly low quality? It worked with his initial efforts, Billy Madison and Happy Gilmore. Those two films defied any sense of logical criticism. They were sloppy, yet contained a maniacal sense of anarchic glee. He seemed thrilled at what he was getting away with. Yet, since the release of those films over a decade ago, he has continued to crank out by-the-numbers mediocrity that lacks any feeling of comic discovery.It is my unfortunate duty now to inform you that his latest, You Don't Mess With The Zohan, is by far his most wretchedly awful film to date. Sandler's character this time, a Mossad agent who dreams of being a hairdresser, would probably fill a lame Saturday Night Live skit, but stretched to over 100 minutes is akin to Chinese water torture.Zohan isn't any normal secret agent; he's a walking caricature of crass Middle Eastern stereotypes and snickering vulgarity. With a Wham!-inspired haircut and a penchant for shtupping elderly women, he finds employment at a small salon run by the sweet, yet blank, Dalia (Emmanuelle Chriqui), a Palestinian woman with no patience for Zohan's sexism. As can be predicted, despite their antagonistic relationship, they soon are yearning to ""make the bam-boom"". Their insipid love story intermingles with a laugh-free subplot featuring Zohan's nemesis the Phantom (John Turturro) and a hapless Arab cab-driver (Rob Schneider, ladies and gentlemen...) ineptly planning murder attempts.Now, racial stereotyping and crude humor can be used to great comic effect in the proper hands. The makers of Borat toed the line brilliantly, delivering great vulgar hilarity mixed with social commentary. You Don't Mess With The Zohan is not even in the same time zone, much less ballpark. The film is amazingly hostile and mean-spirited, mocking its targets with unfiltered scorn for the majority of the running time, yet tacking on a ""we're all the same"" message at the end. It's like the school-yard bully who beats the snot out of you all semester but wishes you a good summer at when vacation time rolls around. Why did no one involved in this debacle pull Sandler aside and gently suggest that this material was unfilmable? Also concerning is the amount of animal abuse presented for cheap laughs. There is a particularly soul-killing scene featuring Zohan and two friends playing hacky-sack with a cat. Now, a good writer would use this undeniably objectionable act as a springboard to a larger pay-off. That would redeem the bad taste and warrant the scene's inclusion. Not here however, where the only apparent joke is that a trio of grown men are kicking the stuffing out of a helpless animal.What is almost fascinating about Zohan is how little interest the screen-writers have in their own story. New story lines are launched at random to replace the ones running out of gas. I couldn't believe that the introduction of an evil land-developer to the film occurred near the end of the second act. It would seem that writers' Sandler, Judd Apatow, and Robert Smigel knew that their material was limited and hoped that by padding it liberally, no one would notice. Hence, the heavy helping of crotch close-ups, homophobia, hummus jokes, and dry humping present. As well, the endless cameos come off as desperate and pointless, although it is amusing that Mariah Carey has finally found a fitting companion piece for Glitter.To call You Don't Mess With The Zohan a misfire is a grand understatement. It's a dreary trudge through migraine-inducing territory that is all the more unforgivable considering the level of talent involved. There's an old adage that it takes true skill and artistry to create a truly horrific film, as hacks will only produce bland mediocrity. Well, Zohan is a colossal achievement, a film that will receive endless mentions on ""Worst of 2008"" lists, and the rants of legions of angry ticket-buyers. With that said though, Sandler may have inadvertently found a point of agreement for Israelis and Palestinians. I think that both sides would agree that You Don't Mess With The Zohan flat-out SUCKS!",You Don't Mess with the Zohan

I even enjoyed some of the Adam Sandler movies that are widely considered sucktastic (i.e. ""Little Nicky"").I've lived in my area for twelve years, and have seen over one-hundred different movies in my local theater. Through all of these movies, I have never once seen a single person leave a movie -- nor have I ever really been tempted to leave a movie.

(currently a 5.8) The theater was packed on the day I went to see this (opening weekend)...and I went with 6 other people. All of us laughed a lot and left the theater talking about how we thought it was a very funny movie. Consistently the remarks were that we didn't expect it to be so good! The laughs in the theater were very loud and seemed to be coming from throughout the auditorium. Perhaps this humor isn't for everyone but it never occurred to me until now that there would be so many lower ratings. I say this because I most always feel the reviews here at IMDb are right on and rely upon them for my movie going choices. My wife feels the same way about this...very confused at the lower score.

As for the SPOILERS, the movie may seem a little bit racy, but in general (as to most movies too), they have the moral or the point at the end of the movie. If you know history at all, there's been a big war between the Pakistanis and the Israelis for years upon years and pretty much at the end of the movie (and all through it actually), they are saying the war is pointless. Just quit the fighting. On the other hand, they made some political jokes (my favorite was ""I would do McCain's wife, she probably doesn't get any anyway."").

Yes, I got the New York angle. And, yes, I was very alive during the 80's and the attempts at humor were not lost on me. Quite simply, the material wasn't funny. I don't mean it was ""unfunny"" by comedy standards, I mean it was unfunny by Adam Sandler standards.There were a couple of scenes that were quite humorous, and they thankfully weren't drawn out to lose the effect.

This is an unusual genre to use with propaganda, and the viewer is not really paying attention to all the pro-zionism hints. Thats why its so effective.Its not a secret that Adam Sandler is a jew and zionist(no disrespect), but i didn't think it was THIS important to him. He ""sells his soul"" as a comedian and takes a giant leap towards politics.Its clear that the creators agenda were to ""inform"" people and support Israels cause, and not to entertain.Some examples:Why does the heros(Adam Sandler) father have to tell the story about how Israel ""won"" the Six-day war in ""only six days""? Whats the purpose? Why implement this in the movie?Zohan(Sandler) says with a sarcastic voice to the ""terrorist"" after kicking his ass: good point!

I took a look around and there were young kids in the theater! Like around 8 years and up! So not appropriate for them to watch. I was putting my head down in embarrassment most of the time! Half way through the movie at least 15 people had got up and walked out! I had never walked out of a movie before, but I turned to the person I was with, and we were both ready to leave! We both got up and left. But to the parents of all the kids that were in there, or who will let there kids go see this movie, Please don't. I know your kids are not totally sheltered from the world. But don't put them out there in it! I'm 24 and I didn't want to sit and watch this horrible movie! I am a mom myself, and I just wanted to cover the ears and eyes of the kids.

A little bit of knowledge of politics is helpful and if your one of those people who knows nothing about other cultures other then your own then you might not get as much out of it. It was all together an awesome movie and I can't wait till it comes out so I could buy it. LOVED IT . would go to see it again anytime. Go Adam... The movie is not for all ages for it does have allot of sexual commentary and is a little crude at times but that is Sandlers style and he does not disappoint in this one....Sandler took a very taboo subject and made it humorous. like connan said the only time Jews and Arabs get along is when they are they are paid to be in a Sandler movie.

So when i sat down to watch i was fairly disappointed. The beginning was dull and took a while to kick in, the continuous drag of droning middle eastern accents got annoying after a while- but despite the crudeness of his jokes and the sexual antics of Zohan somehow pulled it off.

He is a smart guy and he will learn this was a mistake. It's sad how two of my favorite comedians Rob Schneider and Chris Rock are also part of this trash.The hummus thing is just a Xerox copy of the guy using Windex everywhere on ""My big fat Greek wedding"" If you want to laugh with this movie just watch the TV ad, the rest doesn't worth a penny.The only MESS on this movie is the Zohan itself.

My son and his friend are both 10-years-old, and they had seen previews of Zohan, said it was funny, and talked me into taking them to it.It is totally inappropriate for 10-year-olds. Vulgar, nasty, bad language.As for myself, I had never seen an Adam Sandler movie, so I did not have any idea what to expect. I have seen Sandler on the Tonight Show, and other shows, and found him to be immature and silly; never really makes me laugh out loud. I had hoped this movie might provide some mindless, silly fun. Instead, I found it to be humorless, vulgar, and incomprehensible.The story line doesn't make sense. No motive for Sandler's character is given. Basically, Sandler is an Israeli anti-terrorist fighter with super powers, who, for some reason, wants to become a hair stylist in New York City. After many rejections, he finally lands a job at a small hair-styling salon.He increases this small salon's business by playing up to the older women, rubbing his crotch against their arms while washing their hair. When their hair is finished, he takes them into a closet and has sex with them. You can hear the older women moaning, and the products fall off the shelves in the main room. All the older women love this, and soon they are lining up to get in.This is supposed to be hilarious, I guess, but as I looked around the sparse crowd in the movie theater, I didn't see anyone laughing. I sat there embarrassed with my son and his friend. In front of us were two teen-aged girls, who were sitting quietly.I kept waiting for the movie to get better, not wanting to walk out. After about an hour of this time-waster, I told my son and his friend that we had to leave. We walked out of the movie, and I got my money back from the theater.I recommend that you not waste your time on this movie.

Save your money. What started out as a bad idea fermented into an oozing mass of sentimentality. For those who like Sandler, stay away. Keep his comic spirit alive in your mind.True there were some funny parts, but they were quickly repeated in case the audience did not get it the first dozen times. It seemed only one joke was considered funny by the director for he kept shoving it into our faces (and lots of old ladies). Yes, Zohan, your man- meat is impressive. I get it. The script, the has-been actors making cameo appearances, the lack-luster action, the et al proved that mankind is in an evolutionary reverse. I, too, confess. I am in a downward spiral. I watched the movie to the end hoping to grab onto some slender redeeming value--to no avail. It was like playing poker online with play money and throwing a tantrum because I lost to an all-in. Just pointless.To make matters worse, they tried to provide a simple solution to a complex problem that even the best minds cannot solve: the Middle East. To take a light look at a volatile enigma and then to say, ""just be happy,"" at the end insults all who lost family members in Israel/Palestine . Wow, just be happy, what a novel concept.

But than, all of the sudden, bang! some extra hair and he was a much more likable man, possibly because of the funny accent.There was more about this movie than Adam Sandler though, the aspect of the superhuman, the complete absurd. what made this movie funny i think, was that it had a ""borat""-like atmosphere( with the foreigners and their accents etc..) combined with sometimes the typical ""scary movie""-like jokes.The makers of this movie appear to have learned their lessen well, the marketing aspect of this film is perfect, perhaps its time to introduce fizzly bubblelej at McDonnalds if it has not already happened.There where a few flaws of course, like the simplification of the middle east conflict, this was a good chance to point out to the world how serious the situation is, instead the film talks about Israel and Lebanon as if they where 2 children. Instead of telling people to pay attention to Lebanon and Israel and try to get them to understand, they tell them it's no big deal. This is a pain to the hart and brain. Nevertheless, this movie is a comedy and i got much much more than i expected and as far as Adam Sandler movies go, this is about as good as it could possibly get. certainly i recommend this movie because it's worth watching, laughing is for the fools i always say, how i love being a fool.",You Don't Mess with the Zohan

This cannot be done, because in law and by constitution Lebanon does not admit that Israel is an independent country and there is no peace treaty between Lebanon and Israel like the other Arab countries like Palestine, Egypt, Jordan,... If this match was done between for example Israel and Palestine, Israel and Egypt, Israel and Jordan it would have been more credible.There is a scene where The Phantom is seen sleeping with around 20 women. Arabs are believed do be like this throughout history (the ""Hareems"" and stuff).

So,I used to watch movies mock from our ministers -Charlie Wilson's war-or our people-the kingdom-to the end.But all of these movies did not make the mocking of us the main idea or the morality of the movie like ""You don't mess with the Zohan"" ,this film made all the Arab and Muslims look like fool that fight just for pleasure and being HI!!!!!

I'm sure to certain people this film would possibly appeal but if you are looking for harmless fun at the cinema, even this was a bit poor. Adam Sandler seems like a good actor but his full potential was drowned by poor plot and occasionally very dis tasteful gags and jokes.

Also the hero, rescuer, and everyone's buddy. But, the hero is far too shallow. Doesn't seem to have any friends, just groupies. And shallow flattery of, well, guess who. Yeah, flattery of Sadler. You would think after how many movies, the man would have some peace of mind. He could take up Yoga, or some other way of finding purpose in life. Sadler uses far too much crotch grabbing, and crude sexual motion. We also get to see the nude backside of the man a couple times, which wasn't really needed for the movie. The movie is excessively sexual. Both visual close ups of clothed body parts, and also some very obvious sexual references. and the movie ends with some ""lets all get along"" scenes.

However, after watching the movie a few times in a few different settings and with various different groups of people, I was surprised to see the rating on IMDb. While everyone I watched it with enjoyed the movie and thought it was quite funny (despite having different tastes), the rating on IMDb is currently at about 5.7... I personally think that this is definitely one of Sandler's best and wonder if the rating is simply as a result of people's inability to laugh, or be seen laughing, at some of the jokes based on cultural stereotypes. It could also be that people simply need to travel more to understand some of the jokes...In the end, it could be as simple as the age-old cliché: ""to each his own"".

He moves to America, but the seeds of the war he left behind are there waiting for him.

Great choice of songs as usual, which helped with the fun theme and actually made me dance along to.Zohan is one of those movies you can watch over and over, kinda like Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure.

It all boils down to American Redneck intervention causing the problems between Israelis and the Palestinians? Adam Sandler manages to do the impossible my producing more corn per square inch than an Iowan farmer. The first few minutes of the movie was fairly funny what with all the exaggerated fighting abilities of the highly IDF-trained Zohan.

Well, he succeeded in wasting 20 minutes of my time before I could stand no more. Not only are the jokes absolutely lame and the acting pathetic - Adam Sandler in particular seems to be making no effort at all - but the setting of this useless and unintelligent movie in the context of the very serious ongoing Israeli-Palestinian conflict is just sickening.

The premise was good, but it needed more than half a joke and some sad stereotypes to make it work. Perhaps the other script writers were too much in awe of Sandler to suggest the script stank. Perhaps they genuinely thought it was a comic masterpiece - there are those reviewers here that agree with them if that was the case. Personally, I found it OK for the first 15 minutes or so, then dull and repetitive until the end of the film. Not worth the bargain bin price.

I would have never imagined sitting through an hour of a Adam Sandler movie without at least cracking a smile. Punch Drunk Love was a side splitting comedy compared to this movie, I am no exaggerating when I say it was about as funny as Schindlers List. How stoned was he when he thought of this? ""Hey, let's make a movie about an ex-Israeli Special Forces soldier who comes to America to do hair and bang down old ladies."" Nick Swardson was the only person in this movie that actually made me crack a smile, and that was mostly from remembering his performance in Grandma's Boy.

409,stimpy2003,One of the funniest comedies I've seen in a while...,9,26 May 2008,"Okay... It's Adam Sandler. We've known him in many a comedy and as a fan of his, I thought it was one of his best comedy's to date. I can't remember the last time I laughed from start to finish of a movie within the last 10 years. I think that as many people as there are that are anti-Sandler, I find his comedic movies to be exactly what the doctored ordered... a way for people to laugh at themselves and to learn not to take life so seriously. Yes, this movie has a message. So what? Most movies do. I really can't think of any that don't to be honest. Even Indiana Jones makes jokes at the expense of Nazi's but I guess because it's okay to hate Nazi's, the underlying message is okay and the audience is entertained. Don't get me wrong... I loved all the Indiana Jones movies (except Temple... that one doesn't exist in my books) and was ever so disappointed that Sean Connery didn't want to sign up for the Crystal Skull, but even the Indy series has it set of predictable chase scenes, cliffhangers, climaxes and denouements. I enjoyed this film because of its message, not in spite of it. Sandler has the guts to put himself out there, make fun of himself and has a ready made cast that supports him to do so. I 'expect' Rob Schnieder to make an appearance in all of his films or at least the majority of them. (Actually I was disappointed that Steve Buscemi did not have a cameo in this one! Where are you Steve?!!) And in all honesty, after watching the absolute horror and brutality of the latest Rambo movie (and I use the word brutality lightly), I for one was happy to watch a movie that didn't deal with killing for the sake of killing, horror for the sake of horror and other forms of violence that the movie industry seems to thrive on these days. Laughter is good and I found myself merely one of an entire theater of folks who seemed to appreciate Sandler's latest contribution. Fair warning to those who may not like sexual innuendos... this movie is filled with them! But if you are like me, and don't mind the less obvious and more than obvious sex jokes, this film will be a great way to put the worries of the world on pause and take a breather.

411,Sapphirejo,Hmm....actually no point in thinking,5,30 September 2012,"I uh....I'm really not sure where to start with this film. I would say its worth a few laughs, I suppose, its not without its charm in that sense.Zohan is an Israeli agent, he's superfly, moves like a butterfly and stings like a bee. But despite his superhero like abilities and success, he feels there just has to be more to life, he wants to become a hairstylist. So he does. He goes to America, and after struggling, he is befriended and offered lodgings, and is offered work in a hair salon. Many events ensue afterwards, some in a coherent, structured sequence of events that have a direction, some that make absolutely no sense whatsoever. But isn't that life.I suppose when you go to see a comedy you, to an extent, suspend a sense and expectation of reality, so in that sense, if the intention of this film was to take me into surreal realms of embafflement and cringing, I should like to congratulate the creators on their success. The ass-centric shot of sandler gyrating his genitals at a 60 year old woman is firmly and undesirably burned into my retinas, as well as the inspired hose/hummus/pseudo gratification 10 second spectacle.However, beneath a lot of silly humour it appears Sandler had something more to say in this film. A prominent theme is middle eastern people co-existing in peace, many of the characters came to America to escape a life torn by war, and there are more than a few unsubtle allusions to the concept that two sides hurt each other while a party with an interest in such a conflict reaps the rewards, make of that what you will. Its a pleasing and probably ambitious sentiment to put forward that Israeli's and Palestinians can live as brothers, and are not really different, I hope it catches on.Overall, this is not a standout film, its not something to take too seriously, it has its amusing moments, and has a worthwhile message, I just can't help feeling it didn't take too much effort to write/film.

The cameos from Henry Winkler, Maria Carrey and others makes you wonder if they even read the script before agreeing to appear in such a flop.When the movie was over, I felt cheated out of my $6 and literally felt dumber to subjecting myself to an hour and a half of hell.

So when I saw the trailer for ""YDMWTZ"" I assumed it to be one of the lesser quality Adam Sandler films. (I.E: Little Nicky, Anger Management, Chuck & Larry) But I was surprisingly wrong.The movie started out to a humorous start, reminding me of the gags in previous Sandler flicks like Billy Madison and Happy Gilmore. And that's how I approached the movie the whole way through. Sure, it's silly and extremely random, but if people aren't expecting that from the start then of course you will be upset.Apatow's input on the script is apparent and actually fits with the movie. Sandler creates a memorable character with Zohan being one of the most entertaining ones to date. Cameos are frequent and enjoyable and there are several references to other movies if you are familiar with them. The movie has some pretty funny lines I found myself repeating once I left the theater. I'm kind of shocked at all the negativity. There is no WAY I consider this to be one of Sandler's worst efforts. It had way more laughs than several of his other movies and the plot, while slightly out there, fit with all the crazy jokes. Ultimately, the theme of the movie rings true for everyone, and that is enough to make you crack a small smile.Again, it's silly and verging on ridiculous but go with some friends that love to laugh and you'll have a good time.

He has proved that he is funny (SNL) and that he can actually act (Punch Drunk Love, The Wedding Singer) so why? why why why??? Perhaps the profit margins are just that much higher.The improbable plot (Israeli special forces guy moves to America to cut hair...) isn't even the worst thing about it. It's the close to two hours of being bludgeoned about the head with constant, inane dick jokes, slightly more all encompassing sex jokes and racial stereotyping... and the coup de gras... there he is... the least talented man in Hollywood... the ""actor"" who can only get work because he's chums with the star/writer/producer.... Rob Schneider. There are no words to describe how I felt when I saw him, in this film. Again. Surely even Sandler must see how dreadful he is. ... and the schmaltzy ending. Jesus Christ! How do people act through them with a straight face? This one was worse than most.It's not like I went in expecting watertight plots, clever writing or remarkable acting.

Boy, do I wish we'd been on time. This movie is absolutely terrible, with only a few moments that elicit even a chuckle. The writers of this film decided to take pretty much every Israeli and Arab stereotype and beat it to death. The problem wasn't that the jokes were bad as much as that the writers decided to tell the same bad jokes about 20 times. By the time the 50th Hummas joke had been made, I wanted to just leave. Nearly every joke was either a racial stereotype or something about Sandler having sex with elderly women. I thought at first it was some joke obscuring him fixing hair, but he was actually having sex with every 80 year old woman he met. Next, every plot turn was as predictable as can be, and every development can be easily seen by anyone over the age of 10 who has attended a film before. Also, most of the cameos just left me wondering why quality actors would even want to associate with this movie. Henry Winkler, Kevin Nealon, and Chris Rock as a Jamaican taxi cab driver left me scratching my head as to why they were in the movie at all. The few redeeming moments in the film mostly have to do with Rob Schneider, as he gives a usually mediocre performance as a Palestinian out for revenge on the Zohan.

It's about as funny as watching an unpleasant eight year old child impersonate a spastic. So, what's it about? Zohan is a rock hard Isreali soldier who is sick of it all and just wants to cut hair. So, after chasing the imaginatively named 'Phantom' out to sea by hilariously out-pacing a jet ski whilst swimming butterfly, Zohan fakes his own death in the most excruciatingly unfunny comedy fight ever conceived. ""A-ha watch me put this fish on my face, I am harder than you!"", ""A-ha, no you aren't, I can put a fish down my trunks to nibble at my huge bulging Zohan-penis"". Freed of the pressure to single-handedly save Israel, Zohan sets off to America to pursue his dream, falls in love with a hairdresser from the ""Palestinian side"" of the street and brings peace to the middle-east, or something. If you haven't seen this film then for goodness sake don't - however bad you've heard this film is cannot possibly prepare you for the awfulness which has to be seen to be believed, but is much better left unseen.",You Don't Mess with the Zohan

425,Frosti-6,A sweet and Entertaining film,6,13 June 2008,"I watched this movie and while its not ""a piece of art"" or what i consider ""funny as hell comedy"" its rather sweet entertaining and light and perhaps a bit educational,Written partially by Adam Sandler (main actor) this film tries to touch the political agenda of the Middle East in a very unobliging and a Positive view, which turns out to be the main motive of the movie,It is very comic and true parody on ""every day's life"" of Middle East Immigrants (Israli's and arab's) in NY city, really adds life to the picture,Overall very nice comedy that gets points for its political involvement, I liked it!",You Don't Mess with the Zohan
426,elgringorojo,wanted to kill myself would be an understatement,1,19 June 2008,"This movie worse than watching a man with Parkinson's and a dull, rusty hacksaw butcher 10 blind children while listening to The Spice Girls and watching Will and Grace. Trust me, that is in no way hyperbole. I assure you, I barely know the meaning of the word. To the man who claimed that this was the best movie of the summer, I'll grant you that this movie may have been better that some summers, such as the summer of 1944 in Germany, or really any summer in in the 14th century, but even then, not by enough to make you're continued existence on this planet in anyway relevant. Please refrain from posting your ignorance as I am not sure that it isn't contagious. The ignorance of this movie coupled with its complete lack of anything even remotely resembling humor however, is.Thank you in advance David Woolf",You Don't Mess with the Zohan
427,tj-koval,Worst Movie EVER,1,18 June 2008,"I was expecting another brilliant piece of work from Adam Sandler and this is what I got. It was so bad i kept drinking all my soda so i could get refills and take bathroom breaks just so i could get the hell out of there. I am a HUGE Adam Sandler fan but, I don't know how I could watch another one of his movies again without remembering my awful experience with this movie. I say Don't waste a bunch of money going to see it just for a big disappointment at the end. I would rather went and watched The Happening or The Incredible Hulk because i did not like this movie one bit. ( I don't think you will either ) worst movie ever made period",You Don't Mess with the Zohan
428,cooleycooley33,this movie is terrrrrrible,1,16 June 2008,"Take Zohan's advice and don't mess with him. In fact, stay far, far, far, far away.On Sunday afternoon, I was persuaded to see You Don't Mess with the Zohan. I was offered a free ticket, a bag of popcorn, and a candy to be named later. I figured it would be a stupid movie, but at least provide me with a few laughs.You will enjoy this movie if you#1 Like Multiple jokes about Hummus. #2 Like Multiple jokes about Hackey Sack. #3 Like Multiple jokes about old women (60-90) having sex.

429,oscarpinol,Best comedy in many years,9,3 September 2008,"To be honest with all the people coming here, this website, to look for any kind of tip or reference about films, if you are seeing this one right now, you shouldn't wasting time: Rent it now! Go to see it on cinemas! Just fantastic, perfect acting, perfect effects. Just amazing laughs you 'll have. Maybe just because many people say here, you just don't like Sandler acting, you 'll come with a prejudge about the film, but forget about, this is one of the best comedies i've ever seen in my hole life, 27 years old, and i have been seeing it for the last month at least three or four times. I say this cause the idea of this film, the actors, how they play their roles, the language, hilarious language... Everything in this movie cares, and the result is one of the greatest movies of this year. First time i saw it, i couldn't stop to laugh, at the end, i realise how many parts i should see one more time, so i did. You will notice there are parts you have to check out more than once. Well, seems like i represent the movie as a worker, but i am just a fan of this kind of movies that make your life better, cause nobody can pay a smile. One more thing: don't understand how the votes are so low (5.7) People seems like go to the cinema and they are sleeping while they look at the screen. Don't let it pass, a must-see-film.",You Don't Mess with the Zohan
430,Don_Pingu,Good for laughs,8,27 February 2019,"Simple review from my behalf, the movie was made to be a corny comedy, and it sure excelled at that.Would always recommend for a good laugh and to watch a movie without much to think through.",You Don't Mess with the Zohan
