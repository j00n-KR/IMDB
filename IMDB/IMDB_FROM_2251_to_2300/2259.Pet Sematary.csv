0,Leofwine_draca,Stephen King story let down by some badly-cast performers,4,6 October 2016,"Another Stephen King adaptation, with King as screenwriter this time. PET SEMATARY is the place in small-town America (where else?) where kids have been burying their pets for a century. Unfortunately, if pets are buried in a nearby Indian burial ground, they have a tendency to come back to life...A doctor, his wife, two children and pet cat move into the small town and are greeted by a local resident, Jud Crandall (Fred Gwynne). That's right, it's Herman Munster himself, and he's the best thing in this film. A busy road soon kills the cat, and Jud takes Dr Creed down to the burial ground. It comes back from the dead, but of course, something's wrong...PET SEMATARY benefits from some true chills, especially from the dead cat and the creepy cemetery itself. Unfortunately these are the only scary things in the film. Fred Gwynne is always fun to watch and light relief comes from a ghost of a guy who had his head split open. Interesting the actor playing the ghost has gone on to star in some video games, including GABRIEL KNIGHT 2. The ghost keeps on popping up to offer advice which is typically silly and ill thought-out rubbish seemingly borrowed from AN American WEREWOLF IN London.The special effects aren't bad, either, and there are some delightfully gory moments. But when we come to the main cast...oh dear. The main actor just CANNOT ACT. He has an expressionless face throughout the film, even in the horror scenes. I was just crying out for him to scream or something, but no such luck. The puppets in THUNDERBIRDS have more expression than this guy, I think Dale Midkiff is his name. I'm not even going to call this guy an actor, because he cannot act. The corpses in the film were far better actors. The same, too, can be said for the actress who plays his wife, but she has a lesser role in the proceedings and is familiar as Tasha Yar from STAR TREK: THE NEXT GENERATION. Sadly, this was one of my favourite King novels, and this film, with a better cast, could and should have been a lot better than it was.",Pet Sematary
1,SnoopyStyle,not particularly scary or that compelling,5,2 October 2015,"Dr. Louis Creed (Dale Midkiff) and his wife Rachel (Denise Crosby) move from Chicago to a rural home with their young family. Neighbor Jud Crandall (Fred Gwynne) pulls their infant son out of the road traveled by heavy trucks. There is a path behind their house that leads to a pet cemetery. A dead patient's spirit warns Louis about crossing the barrier. When the family cat gets run over, Jud brings Louis to a secret place with strange markings to bury the cat. The next morning, the cat returns alive and then neighbor Missy Dandridge commits suicide. When his young son gets killed by a truck, Louis dares to break the barrier once more.Director Mary Lambert doesn't have quite the vision to bring some style to this Stephen King story. To be fair, the material is not a straight forward slasher movie until the last act. The first two acts are an examination of death. It does not do it with any intensity or moodiness. It looks more like a TV movie. The creepy killer child is very effective but I don't think Dale Midkiff is a particularly good actor.",Pet Sematary
2,Prismark10,Pet Sematary,4,22 December 2019,"Dr Louis Creed (Dale Midkiff) and his wife Rachel (Denise Crosby) move to a small rural town with a main road in front of their house where trucks speed through. Creed never bothered to look at the traffic before he bought the house.Their infant son nearly gets run over by one of these large trucks but for the actions of their elderly neighbour Jud Crandall (Fred Gwynne) who saves him.When their daughter's cat dies. Maybe Creed should had realised that this is a dangerous place to stay. Instead Jud takes him to an Indian burial ground behind a pet cemetery.The next day the cat is alive but acts sinister and aggressive. When their son gets run over, Creed takes his child to the burial ground to reanimate him.With a bland lead actor in Dale Midkiff. It is left to Fred Gwynne to ham it up as the folksy Jud. The direction is flat and uninspired. The story is pretty dumb. By the end Pet Sematary becomes a stupid slasher movie giving the audience some blood but Dr Creed keeps on making dim decisions.",Pet Sematary
3,claudio_carvalho,One of the Creepiest Horror Films Ever Made,10,7 July 2019,"""Pet Sematary"" is one of the creepiest horror films ever made based on the novel and screenplay by the writer Stephen King. It may be considered a masterpiece of horror and cruelty, with the shocking destruction of a family when the father does not accept the loss of his baby boy and learns that sometimes death is better. This is one of the first films where a child becomes a killer like the toy Chucky and it is tough to the viewer to see the lovely child killing his beloved mother. The screenplay has also many details and interesting subplots. The direction of Mary Lambert is top-notch and the cast is also magnificent. My vote is ten.Title (Brazil): ""Cemitério Maldito"" (""Damned Cemitery"")",Pet Sematary
4,kosmasp,Get cemetary,8,10 May 2019,"If you already take offense by the wrong spelling of the word cemetary in the title (guessing you haven't read the book by Stephen King), it might not be a total deal breaker. But you still have to be open minded and especially suspend your disbelief.While this sticks almost entirely and very close to the book (with some omissions), which was clear since this wass written and produced/overseen by King himself, it is a tighter affair. Now I know that some hold the book in very high regard and may have an issue with my take on it (it is the very first adaptation that I felt was better than the source material itself), it's still how I perceived it.No matter your viewpoint, you can't deny that the woman at the helm of this did a great job. Which she isn't too shy to proclaim and take credit for (if you watch the extras on the 30th anniversary blu ray for example). She obviously had a lot of fun and seems like a great person - which translated onto the screen. Some of the effects may have dated, but it still has enough shock moments to keep you on your toes ... and Miko Hughes gives one of the best child performances you have seen ...",Pet Sematary
5,classicsoncall,"""...sometimes, dead is better.""",7,16 November 2016,"Well you have to admit, this was a creepy story, even for Mr. King. Having one of your main protagonists turn out to be a three year old, knife wielding murderer is somewhat beyond the pale. But King wrote the screenplay based on his own novel, so I'm thinking it held pretty close to the original story. And it was pretty cool to see him show up as the Minister at the cemetery when Gage was buried, that doesn't happen too often.I don't think I've ever seen Fred Gwynne outside of his TV work, so having him here as the Creed's next door neighbor was a nice touch. It turns out that Dale Midkiff and Denise Crosby portraying the Creeds are also primarily TV actors, which explains why I haven't caught them in any prior work. They were OK here but their performances didn't really have a stand out quality.Some of the things that got to me didn't really have an impact on the story, but I thought I'd mention them. What's with that odd portrait in the Goldman's living room showing the kid dressed in green with the whip in his hand? That was pretty bizarre. And who names a cat 'Church'? For his trouble, Church didn't even get a screen credit, I really wanted to know who played the part.But you know what might have been the most bizarre thing about the picture? How about ghost sister Zelda with the spinal meningitis - the role was actually played by a man!!!",Pet Sematary
6,gavin6942,One of the Better King Stories,7,12 October 2010,"A doctor (Dale Midkiff) and his family move to a new home, dangerously close to a busy highway. After the death of the family cat, the doctor's neighbor lets him in on a secret: there is a sacred Indian burial ground where buried pets come back to life. The obvious question is: does it work on people? Not to say this is a bad film (it's not), but the thing about this one is that its reputation and cultural impact have overshadowed the film itself. We all know that burying things in the sacred ground will bring them back to life, and that's without even having to see this film.There is much good to say about this one: an amazing talent in Gage Creed, the little boy. Some nice violence and gore (including an Achilles tendon slice). One of the most painful things I've seen on film, when the doctor falls out of bed (I admit I winced a bit).Mike Mayo points out that this is something of a variation on ""The Monkey's Paw"", and we agree it's a praiseworthy version. He says the film ""lasts 30 seconds too long"", and I see his point, but cannot comment on that here. Howard Maxford is considerably more critical (as usual -- he is the most negative horror critic I know) and says it is ""over-extended"" and could have made a good half hour of television.Stephen King has made some good films and some bad ones (how much this is his fault or the fault of the directors is debatable). This falls firmly in the good category. Not among his very best (""Shawshank Redemption"" is number one), but still worth a few watches.",Pet Sematary
7,lee_eisenberg,"Happy 60th, Stephen!",6,21 September 2007,"Since today is Stephen King's 60th birthday, I wanted to talk about a movie adapted from one of his stories. ""Pet Sematary"" brings to mind ""Frankenstein"", partially because of Herman Munster portrayer Fred Gwynne but also the idea that when things die it's best to leave them dead. But when the boy comes back to life, the movie really gets neat. Some of his faces remind me of Danny in ""The Shining"" (but this is no ""Shining"" by any stretch). Speaking of which, both stories involve things returning from the dead in different forms. Can we never see the past without something disastrous happening?! So, this is far from the best adaptation of a Stephen King story - parts of it were kind of silly - but good enough for a fun time. Watch for King as the minister.Tom Savini and George Romero were both offered the chance to direct, Bruce Campbell was offered the role of the father. I just wonder what would have happened had Savini or Romero directed the guy who said ""boom-stick"".",Pet Sematary
8,jboothmillard,Pet Sematary,5,15 September 2005,"I previously watched this scary movie years ago, most likely during my time in college, I knew I needed to watch it again, due to my short and badly written review, and I was thinking my low opinion may change, based on the book by Stephen King, directed by Mary Lambert (Madonna: ""Like a Virgin"", ""Material Girl"", ""Like a Prayer""). Basically, Louis Creed (Dale Midkiff) has accepted a job as a physician with the University of Maine, so he and his family, wife Rachel (Denise Crosby) and their children Ellie (Blaze Berdahl) and Gage (Kindergarten Cop's Miko Hughes) have moved from Chicago to rural Ludlow, Maine. They befriend their neighbour Jud Crandall (Fred Gwynne) (his character was spoofed in the South Park episode ""Butters' Very Own Episode""), who takes them to an isolated pet cemetery (misspelled ""sematary"") in the forest behind the Creeds' new home. Louis encounters Victor Pascow (Brad Greenquist), a jogger who is mortally injured after being hit by a truck. He warns Louis about the pet cemetery before dying, calling Louis by name though they have never met. That night, the ghost Pascow appears to Louis and leads him to the Pet Sematary, warning him not to cross the barrier because the ground beyond is ""sour"". Louis awakens, assuming he had a bad dream, but notices his feet are covered in dirt. Rachel meanwhile is haunted by nightmares hrself, of her deceased sister Zelda (Andrew Hubatsek), who was terminally ill and grotesquely disfigured, who constantly caused Rachel and her family misery as they cared for. Rachel secretly hated Zelda, she died when Rachel was left alone to care for her, after finally succumbing to death from her disease, Rachel has been haunted by her spirit ever since. During Thanksgiving while the family is gone, Ellie's cat, Winston Churchill, or ""Church"", is hit by a car. Realising Ellie will be devastated, Jud takes Louis beyond the cemetery and deep into the woods, where they reach an ancient burial ground. Jud instructs Louis to bury the cat and warns him not to tell anyone about what they have done. The next day a reanimated Church returns home. He now stinks, moves sluggishly, and is aggressive toward Louis. Jud explains that as a boy (Matthew August) he revived his pet dog in the same way, he wanted to save Ellie the grief of losing her pet. Louis asks Jud if they can do the same with a person, but Jud is shocked he would ask or consider such a thing. Sometime later, the Creeds are enjoying the sunshine and flying a kite. Gage is killed by a truck along the same road as the cat. Jud anticipates that Louis is considering burying his son in the burial ground, although Louis denies it. Jud believes that introducing Louis to the ritual ground aroused the malevolent forces present there, which caused Gage's death. Jud tells Louis the story of a local named Bill Baterman (Chuck Courtney) who buried his son Timmy (Peter Stader) in the burial ground after he was killed in World War II. Timmy returned as a malevolent zombie, terrifying the townsfolk. Jud and a group of men tried to destroy Timmy by burning down the Baterman house, only for Bill to be trapped inside to perish also. Jud insists that the burial ground is evil, and Louis must not bury his son there. After the funeral, Rachel and Ellie leave for Chicago while Louis stays in Maine. Despite Pascow and Jud's warnings, Louis unearths his Gage's grave and takes his son's body to bury him at the ritual site. In Chicago, Pascow appears to Ellie in a dream and warns her that her father is about to do something terrible. Rachel is unnerved by her daughter's dream but can only reach Jud on the phone, so she decides to return to Maine, which alarms Jud. That night, the reanimated Gage returns home and steals a scalpel from his father's bag. He taunts Jud before slashing his foot and his mouth, before biting his throat, killing him. Rachel returns home and is lured into Jud's house by the voice and spirit of Zelda (Andrew Hubatsek), only to find Gage, holding a scalpel. In shock and disbelief, Rachel reaches down to hug her son and he kills her. Waking up the following day, Louis sees Gage's muddy footprints in the house and discovers his scalpel is missing. He receives a phone call from Gage that he has ""played"" with Jud and Mommy. Louis fills three syringes with morphine and heads to Jud's house. Encountering Church, he kills the cat with an injection. Gage taunts Louis further and he is startled by Rachel's corpse hanged from the attic before Gage attacks him. After a brief battle, Louis overpowers Gage and injects him with the morphine syringe. He then lights Jud's house on fire and carries Rachel's body away with him. Pascow appears and warns Louis not to ""make it worse"", but grief-stricken Louis believes that because Rachel has not been dead long, burying her ""will work this time"". Pascow cries out in frustration and vanishes as Louis passes through him. That night, Rachel returns to Louis and the couple embrace. But Rachel takes a large knife from the counter, before Louis screams. Also starring Michael Lombard as Irwin Goldman, Susan Blommaert as Missy Dandridge, and Mary Louise Wilson as Dory Goldman. This is a morbid but compulsive story, the thought of dead pets and relatives buried in a place to come back as nasty killer zombies is a devilish concept, so seeing evil cats and terrifying toddlers is most memorable. I agree that bits in between the scary parts, including the weird flashback sequences, and the appearance of possibly unnecessary ghost characters does interrupt things a little, but it does get your nerves jangling when it needs to, overall it is reasonable supernatural horror. It was nominated the Razzie for Worst Original Song for ""(I Don't Wanna Be Buried in A) Pet Sematary"". Worth watching!",Pet Sematary

The motion picture is professionally directed by Mary Lambert though seem doesn't improve in the transition from page to screen and fails the visualising of complex narrative plot by means of confuse flashbacks . She also realized the following (1992) , much worse than original, with Edward Furlong , Anthony Edwards and Clancy Brown , causing similar terror and same kind of gore as the previous movie .

10,BA_Harrison,Buried under several feet of preposterousness.,5,24 August 2009,"Young doctor Louis Creed (Dale Midkiff), wife Rachel (Denise Crosby), daughter Ellie (Blaze Berdahl), and toddler Gage (Miko Hughes) move into a new home situated dangerously close to a main road (or should that be Maine road?) regularly used by speeding petrol tankers, and adjacent to a creepy cemetery for dead animals who have failed to master the Green Cross Code (hey, it was either this house, or the property between the explosives factory and the home for the criminally insane).After Ellie's beloved cat Church is inevitably flattened, Louis follows elderly neighbour Herman Munster (Herman Munster) beyond the cemetery boundary (despite warnings from the ghost of a deceased teenager) to an ancient Indian burial ground where the soil has the ability to bring the dead back to life. And sure enough, the cat comes back, only much meaner than before.So when little Gage also disappears under the wheels of a semi (seems like putting up a fence wasn't very high on the Creeds' 'to-do' list), Louis decides to repeat the process; the only problem is, the reanimated toddler turns out to be far more deadly than the cat...Mary Lambert's adaptation of Stephen King's novel is well directed, offers some genuinely chilling moments (Gage's death is extremely disturbing, particularly if you have children of your own), and a decent smattering of gore, but loses a lot of credibility thanks to some very daft flaws in the plot, a wooden performance from leading man Midkiff, and an over-reliance on cat based jump scares to shock the audience (I counted three; it may have been more).Given its history, the very idea of the ancient Micmac burial ground remaining undisturbed is quite frankly ludicrous: at the very least, the site would be of interest to historians and scientists, but such a magical place would most likely be requisitioned by the government for 'testing' (imagine the possibilities for the military). It's also asking a lot of the audience to believe that a small child could go head-to-head with an 18 wheeler and not be reduced to pate, that a child (however supernaturally strong) would be able to hoist an adult's body through a loft hatch, or that someone would ever consider bringing back a loved one when fully aware of the consequences.All of these ridiculous conceits (plus a few others that I can't be bothered to recall) seriously undermine Pet Sematary's overall effectiveness, meaning that I cannot bring myself to rate the film any higher than a distinctly average 5/10.",Pet Sematary
11,Quinoa1984,"one of King's creepiest, bone-curdling stories amid decent film-making",7,15 December 2005,"In the trivia section for Pet Sematary, it mentions that George Romero (director of two Stephen King stories, Creepshow and The Dark Half) was set to direct and then pulled out. One wonders what he would've brought to the film, as the director Mary Lambert, while not really a bad director, doesn't really bring that much imagination to this adaptation of King's novel, of which he wrote the screenplay. There are of course some very effective, grotesquely surreal scenes (mainly involving the sister Zelda, likely more of a creep-out for kids if they see the film), and the casting in some of the roles is dead-perfect. But something feels missing at times, some sort of style that could correspond with the unmistakably King-like atmosphere, which is in this case about as morbid as you're going to get without incestuous cannibals rising from the graves being thrown in (who knows if he'll save that for his final novel...) As mentioned though, some of the casting is terrific, notably Miko Hughes as Gage Creed, the little boy who goes from being one of the cutest little kids this side of an 80's horror movie, to being a little monster (I say that as a compliment, of course, especially in scenes brandishing a certain scalpel). And there is also a juicy supporting role for Fred Gwynne of the Munsters, who plays this old, secretive man with the right notes of under-playing and doom in tone. And applause goes to whomever did the make-up on Andrew Hubatsek. But there are some other flaws though in the other casting; Dale Midkiff is good, not great, as the conflicted, disturbed father figure Creed, and his daughter Ellie is played by an actress that just didn't work for me at all.In terms of setting up some chilling set-pieces, only a couple really stand-out: a certain plot-thickening moment (not to spoil, it does involve a cool Ramones song), and the first visit to the pet sematary (the bigger one), including the sort of mystical overtones King had in the Shining. For the most part it's a very polished directing job, though it could've been made even darker to correspond with the script. If thought out in logical terms (albeit in King terms) it is really one of his more effective works of the period. But it doesn't add up like it could, or should. Still, it makes for a nifty little midnight movie.",Pet Sematary
12,Coventry,Intense enough...but overrated,7,31 August 2003,"It's true what they say : ""Pet Sematary"" really gets through and touches you deeply. It grabs your attention right away and it doesn't let go until the ending credits roll. It's pretty easy to explain why, though. The film handles about two very sensible topics, namely, the death of poor innocent animals and ... children! I'm sure almost everybody lost a beloved pet when they were young once, so this story affects you more than the average fight with aliens or ax-wielding serial killers, for example. In this horror movie, you're a lot more involved...That's the power it has. And of course, a child's death is always touching. You know from the beginning that the poor boy will die and yet, you're still very shocked when it actually happens. Out of the whole oeuvre of Stephen King's writings turned into film, ""Pet Sematary"" ranks among the better ones. He obviously thinks so himself, because he clearly had fun in his small role of the priest. Although I would say the ""suspense"" of this movie is somewhat overrated. In fact, it's pretty predictable if you ask me. But, it's got good acting, good directing by Mary Lambert ( lucky shot, though. She completely screwed up the sequel) and it's good emotional moments...A lot of them!. Pet Sematary also has originality, which is the most important thing about the finished product, in my opinion. The image of Victor Pascow scared the hell out of me when I was young. I first saw this movie at the age of 8 and the ghost of his used to make me crawl behind the couch. Too bad I grew up....",Pet Sematary

15,hitchcockthelegend,"And the night when the cold wind blows, No one cares, nobody knows.",6,28 December 2014,"The Stephen King novel from which the screenplay was adapted very nearly didn't see the light of day. It was actually written by King based on a real place and instances during a stay at a rented house. He was never quite happy with the tone of the book and only submitted it as a contractual obligation. Glad he did because it provides a very solid grounding for horror and deals with the very real horrors of overwhelming grief.The film gets the tonal flows right, the family dynamic is neatly pitched in readiness for what is to come later, the house and the titular Pet Sematary of the title are eerie personified, and Fred Gwynne is on hand for a sage old characterisation. The potential for shattering horror is not fully realised, yet the makers deliver a good quota of scares and unease to make this a better than average King adaptation to screen. The use of the Ramones in the soundtrack is a good one, King loved them, they loved him, so much so they wrote the title track and named an album after it. 6.5/10",Pet Sematary
16,Hey_Sweden,What you own always comes home to you.,7,25 February 2020,"Stephen King adapted his own bestseller for the big screen with this so-so familial horror film that does manage to get some things right, even if it's not altogether a success. Certainly the premise would hit home for any parent: outliving your children, especially if the child in question dies in such a horrific way as is depicted here.The Creeds are a young family who move to rural Maine, into a home facing a highway where semis roar at top speed in either direction at all times. Now, this family is led to ruin basically because the dad (Dale Midkiff) and mom (Denise Crosby) are afraid to teach their children about death as a fact of life, and who wimp out to begin with when faced with the concept of death. Their adorable son (three year old Miko Hughes) is mowed down by one of these semis, and the dad has learned that there is a Micmac Indian burial ground within walking distance that has terrible powers of resurrection.The main characters behave like fools, but we wouldn't have many horror stories without people like this, now would we? The fact that they're not as sympathetic as they could be is one debit, the miscasting of Midkiff and Crosby is another. He in particular is so terrible at times that his performances only serves to induce laughter. A shame, really, because there IS an overall sombre quality to this tale, and an atmosphere of gloom right from the beginning. (Elliot Goldenthals' score plays no small part in the mood.) There are also some enjoyably gnarly makeup effects by Lance Anderson, and the supporting cast sparks some life into the proceedings. Fred Gwynne is a standout as the savvy aged neighbour who realizes what a mistake he's made in telling the dad about the Indian burial ground. (Characters mess about with such places all the time in horror films, and they always pay a heavy price; it's one of the standard plot set-ups in the genre.) Brad Greenquist is also memorable as the mangled spirit who attempts to prevent the dad from doing the wrong thing. And who doesn't feel creeped out by the Zelda character, actually played by a man (Andrew Hubatsek)?As of this writing, this viewer has not yet seen the 2019 adaptation, so he can't comment on the matter of whether it is a better or worse adaptation of Kings' novel. But with this film, it's a classic example of decent material that doesn't reach its full potential. The finale does have some suspense, and overall uneasiness, but it's hard to be all that emotionally involved. At least this ends on a good note: usage of the Ramones tune ""Pet Sematary"".Seven out of 10.",Pet Sematary

But a little further on is a sacred ground which can bring the dead back to life...but the dead come back in a nasty mood.""""DEFINITE SPOILERS** The novel by Stephen King was good--it was long but it developed characters and situations that made you care what happened. This movie jettisons ALL the character development and just plays up the gore and violence. Animals are killed ON camera (I know it's faked but it's still repulsive); a little boy is hit by a semi and his casket pops open during the funeral (in a totally sick scene); he's brought back to life and attacks and kills people including his mom (I DO wonder how a 3 year old was able to hang her); a ghostly jogger (don't ask) tries to help the family for no reason...The movie just works the audience over shoving every gruesome death or violence into your face. It just goes out of its way to shock you. **END SPOILERS**Acting is no help. Midkiff is just dreadful as the father--he's handsome and buff but totally blank. Crosby isn't much better. The two kids are just annoying. Only Gwynne single-handedly saves this picture with his effortless good acting.This picture shows a total contempt for the audience taking large leaps in logic and having characters do incredibly stupid things (especially Midkiff at the end). This movie was (inexplicably) a huge box office hit in 1989 which led to the even worse sequel in 1992. I saw it in a theatre back then and was disturbed how the audience kept cheering on the violence and was just appalled by what I saw. A sick repulsive horror film. A 1 all the way.When you think it's all over and can't get worse the Ramones sing a title song!!!!!! (""I don't wanna be buried in a pet cemetery""). Truly beyond belief.",Pet Sematary
18,LeonLouisRicci,Shredded Flesh Fetish Film is Mostly Just Offensive,5,31 May 2014,"Gruesome Gore Fest takes a while to get going but the Third Act is worth the wait for Horror Fans and Slasher Movie Sickos. It is Really an Exercise in Shredded Flesh Fetishes and has a Very Downbeat Tone that Permeates this Putrefied Picture.The Acting is Bland, especially the Lead Male that was a Blip on the Hunk for Hire Radar and is Thankfully doing something else by now. But the Rest of the Cast isn't much Better. Mabey Fred Gwynne is OK but even He wears out His Welcome Quickly.The Beginning and the Middle are Slow and Ponder About Burial Grounds and Mysticism and is just Boring. The Ending with its Slicing and Dicing is the Highlight of the Movie and tells You Much about the Film's Shortcomings.Overall, Worth a Watch for Stephen King Completest, and Horror Movie Fanatics, but Others may find this Oddly Offensive with its Use of Animals and Kids as Deformed and Bloodied Ghosts and Zombies.

Their new home is on a busy road that huge trucks use & a friendly neighbour Judd Crendall (Fred Gwynne) warns them about it's dangers, however despite this the Creed's cat Church is ran over & killed which will upset young Ellie so Judd takes Louis to an ancient Indian burial ground to bury Church which they do & the next morning Church is alive & running around but something is different about him somehow. Then tragedy strikes as little Gage is ran over & killed too, in desperation Louis steals his son's body & buries it at the Indian burial ground & waits for Gage to return from the dead, he does but it's not the same Gage as before...The second feature film directorial outing by one time Madonna music video director (Like a Prayer, Borderline, Material Girl, Like a Virgin) Mary Lambert the screenplay was written by Stephen King himself based on his novel of the same name from 1983 & is a perfectly watchable horror film but isn't anything amazing. One thing that has always annoyed me about Pet Sematary is the incorrect way the title is spelled, of course it should be spelled Pet Cemetery & the reason why it isn't is because a real pet cemetery near King's home was similarly misspelled by whoever wrote the bloody sign & certain events from the film are apparently inspired by events in King's life including his own daughter's cat getting run over. The film takes itself extremely seriously & has a sedate pace that isn't exactly brimming with action or incident, in fact it takes quite a while to get going & even then it just seems to repeat itself as during the first half Louis buries the dead cat Church who was run over & comes back & then during the second half he buries his dead son Gage who also was run over & who also comes back to life in an ending which is both silly & fairly creepy as the at times angelic looking three year old kid starts stalking his family with a scalpel. The character's are a bit poor, Rachel in particular is very one dimensional & other character's like Missy the maid who commits suicide seem like an afterthought or like they belong in a different film. There are a few flashbacks which slow things down further & while there are some good moments & the story is fairly original & sound the film has it's flaws the biggest of which i thought was if Judd knew that using the Indian burial site was wrong & the dead came back evil why did he let Louis bury Church there? Why tell Louis? There are strong supernatural elements here with a ghost who tries to warn the Creed's & the whole ancient Indian legend stuff & coming back from the dead which work well enough.The film obviously had a bit spent on it & it looks very good with nice production values although the cast is bland. There's not a whole lot of gore here, there's a bit of blood & a gruesome killing by scalpel at the end but little else. Apparently George A. Romero was set to direct this but when filming was delayed he moved on, special make-up effects man Tom Savini was offered but turned down the chance to direct, Stephen King himself has a small cameo as a minister conducting the funeral of Missy while genre favourite Bruce Campbell was first choice for Louis Creed & I'm sure he would have had more screen presence than Midkiff. At one point actor Fred Gwynne says his character used to have a pet named Spot which was actually the name of the family pet in The Munsters (1964 - 1966) in which he starred.With a supposed budget of about $11,500,000 this was shot just twenty minutes from Stephen King's home in Maine. The acting is surprisingly poor here with a really bland & faceless cast who don't inspire any sort of sympathy.Pet Sematary is a decent Stephen King adaptation although generally speaking his novels & stories just don't make great films for whatever reason, I've seen worse for sure but I've seen better too. Followed by a sequel Pet Sematary II (1992) which I know I have seen but can't remember anything about other than it's got John Conor from Terminator 2: Judgment Day (1991) in it.",Pet Sematary
20,Boba_Fett1138,Just above average.,7,19 April 2009,"This is basically you're typical Stephen King adaptation, with some pretty average production values (has a made for TV type of look over it) and just acceptable acting performances. Most Stephen King adaptations are like this, with of course the exception of the obvious movie titles. Still the movie is slightly better than the average one, mostly due to the movie its second halve.To be honest, the movie was not like I expected at first. Perhaps the movie its title is a bit misleading. It suggest that the movie is about a bunch of death animals coming alive and causing some mayhem. This is only part of the movie its story though, that in its second halve takes a more interesting approach with its concept.The movie begins quite annoying actually, with its family that is being portrayed like a perfect and happy bunch, including some annoying nagging kids, who really don't talk and act like real normal children. Why do movies keep doing this? There also isn't an awful lot of horror to enjoy at that point but the movie gets more bold toward its ending and that is mostly what saves the movie and still makes this a horror movie that is worth watching, despite not being anything too spectacular, shocking or memorable.The movie has a bunch of subplots which however never get used and developed properly. This is what happens when you use a novel as main source for your movie. What often works out in a novel simply doesn't work out for a movie its flow. It was the first Stephen King adaptation for which he self write the screenplay as well. King perhaps demanded a bit too much power over this movie because he was too afraid they would turn the movie into something completely else from his novel. Movie-wise this wasn't the best move. Guess he also learned from this though, since ever since he never wrote a screenplay again for any full length movie.Well worth watching, though certainly not the best or most exciting the genre has to offer.7/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",Pet Sematary
21,view_and_review,One of Stephen King's Worst,3,24 June 2014,"If this wasn't the worst Stephen King movie I don't know what is. I know it's not all Stephen King's fault, but he did write the novel and the screenplay so he takes the lion share of the blame. This movie was meandering along until one critical moment. There was the OMG moment that made the entire movie bad. I was going to suffice with giving a general review but because of that one moment I now have to mention everything wrong with this movie.What was that moment? When mush-for-brains Dr. Louis Creed allowed his son to wander onto a highway and get hit by a truck. Didn't he nearly get hit when you first moved to the new town? How in the world did you turn your back on your two year old son long enough for him to wander clear onto a highway? Really???? OK, so now I'm going to town with all the stuff I didn't like.1.) The acting. I see that Dale Midkiff went to the same acting school as Keanu Reeves. All of the acting was poor with the exception of Miko Hughes-and I was just impressed he could speak so well for a toddler. I'm used to toddlers babbling even on screen.2.) Jud. Jud introduces Louis to the Indian burial grounds only to reveal to him later that he once used it to bury his dog and his dog was never the same. Well, Judd, if you frikkin knew that why would you have Louis bury the cat there? Oh yeah, you figured that Ellie couldn't handle the loss of her cat. What a flimsy excuse.3.) Rachel and her sister that died from spinal meningitis. What in the universe did that have to do with anything? 4.) Gage. What kind of name is Gage? I thought that his dad had an affinity for shotguns or wire.5.) Postmortem Gage. Boy did he remind me of Chucky. Undead or not, possessed or not; he was still a 25 pound toddler. No 25 pound scalpel wielding toddler can slice and dice people with that efficiency. Furthermore, the scene with Louis fighting his undead son was just laughable. He was literally holding the kid while the kid is hacking him to pieces with a scalpel. Come on man! 6.) Dr. Louis Creed. After your cat was acting creepy. After the warnings from Jud. After your son butchered two people and nearly butchered you. You still go back to the Indian burial ground as though somehow this time things will be different. You are a moron.7.) Dr. Louis Creed again. I still can't get over how you let your son wander onto the highway. That was deplorable.That's it. I've said my piece. I was very disappointed with this movie, it definitely wasn't one of Stephen King's finer moments. But I guess you can't win them all.",Pet Sematary
22,neil-476,Good,7,6 July 2011,"Film adaptations of Stephen King's work don't fit into the category ""Good"" that often. Most of them are better classified as ""Not very good"" while a handful can be filed under ""Great"" (step forward Frank Darabont and take a bow). However, Pet Sematary is good.Louis Creed and his family (wife, daughter, toddler son) move to a new town: their new house is next to a road which enormous trucks roar up and down, so you just know this is not going to end well. When the daughter's cat is duly smacked into oblivion by a truck, kindly old next door neighbour Jud shows Louis that if you bury things in the old Micmac burial ground behind the Pet Sematary on the hillside, well, they come back. 'Course, they don't exactly come back in exactly the way they were before they died... Nonetheless, when toddler Gage is injudicous enough to play chicken with a truck (and lose), Louis gives in to temptation. Further unpleasantness ensues.This follows King's novel quite closely, albeit it beefs things up with some supernatural special effects, and underplays what, for me, was the most nightmarish part of the novel, namely Louis' expedition to recover Gage's body so that he can rebury it up in the Indian burial ground.The adaptation is solid, the creepiness and scares are there, the cast is all good (especially Fred Gwynne - Dale Midkiff is a little bland), and the film keeps King's ending, I'm glad to say.This is a decent horror film with a good sense of escalating awfulness.",Pet Sematary
23,AlsExGal,Lost in translation,6,25 March 2017,"Dr. Louis Creed moves his entire family to a remote Maine town where he will be the physician for a local college. Over Thanksgiving, while his wife and children are visiting her parents, his daughter's cat is hit by a truck and killed on the road in front of his house. The road has had a history of taking the lives of beloved pets since the dawn of the automobile age, and there is an actual pet cemetery near their house where local people have interred their dear departed pets, with a child's scribble on a sign marking the place, thus the title ""Pet Sematary"".Louis' strange neighbor leads him to an ancient Indian burial ground where he is instructed to bury the cat. The next day, the cat appears alive in Louis' garage. Louis thinks he has spared his daughter the trauma of losing her cat. However, the cat's nature has changed. Now the animal delights in tormenting Louis with such gifts as a dead rat while Louis is soaking in the bathtub. You see, while the bodies of the departed return alive, their souls are not those of the original owner. One malicious reincarnated cat can't do much harm, but Louis soon experiences the loss of a human member of his family and he is about to see just how malevolent the forces are that rule the old burial ground.This film was adapted from a story in which the past of Fred Gwynne as the odd neighbor, the Creed housekeeper, and some other background is fleshed out and if it had been somehow included the film might have made more sense, such as explaining the deep the animosity between Louis' inlaws and himself.",Pet Sematary
24,kannibalcorpsegrinder,Rather huge missed opportunity,6,10 January 2013,"Moving to a new home in the Maine countryside, a man finds a special burial ground behind his house and tries to use it to save his family only for things to take a wrong turn when the returned beings aren't the way they were before.A rather curious affair, as this one's reputation tends to make it far better than it really is and seems to have gotten by based on rather dubious merits. Although there's a fine cast and certainly worthwhile talents behind-the-scenes, this one's more a product of those elements rather than what's on-screen since not too much actually happens since this one tends to abandon what had been rather fine material with the cursed burial ground and his growing realization of the area's powers, but this is abandoned in favor of family melodrama which really isn't that interesting or exciting at all. That seems to be what the film is mostly going for since there's very little scares or chilling moments since the first burial doesn't occur until nearly an hour into the film, and very little happens once that starts becoming common-place. While it does have some pretty decent killings and bloodletting on display, especially once it gets to its end where the action really kicks in and are even treated to a spectacular burning-the-house down finale, the main focus on actually offing a child seems to be the main selling point here and what happens once that plays a part in the plot, not based on any other real determining factor. This one's gotten by on reputation rather than anything else.Rated R: Graphic Violence, Adult Language, and Adult Themes about death.",Pet Sematary
25,Aaron1375,Follows the book pretty good.,7,7 March 2003,"This is one of the few King movie adaptations that follows the book pretty good.  Only Jud's wife seems to be missing from the movie, but you can't have everything that was in the book.  The story revolves around an old Indian burial ground that can apparently bring the dead back to life.  The book was written in 84 I think and there is actually an Italian movie called Zeder put out in 83 that is very similar in some areas to this.  I don't think King was inspired by it cause I doubt he could have seen it, but there are similarities.  One part from the book I wish they had left in the movie though is the path to the Indian burial grounds.  The creepiest part of the book is all the strange things they saw on their way from the pet cemetery to the burial ground.  In the movie it doesn't look as if there is a whole lot they have to go through to get there.  For the most part a rather somber movie that could use a few more scares...all in all though it is a pretty good King movie.",Pet Sematary
26,The_Void,Nice little horror flick,7,22 May 2005,"Once upon a time, a very irritating man met an annoying woman and they had two irritating/annoying kids together. Some time later, they moved to a house in the countryside, which coincidently was located nearby a strange type of cemetery that harboured people's pets and a funny old man that may be wiser than he looks, and all kinds of havoc ensued! So goes the story of Pet Semetary, then, which despite being no classic; is certainly worth seeing. Stephen King's books have been translated to the screen with mixed results, and although this isn't one of the best results that the great author has had; it certainly isn't one of the worst. The plot moves slowly, but it utilises this to best effect, as in spite of the lack of action, Pet Semetary never manages to become boring and, in fact, the movie is better for it's slow plotting as it allows the film to develop a rhythm for the characters to wallow in, and once you get into the movie; it is this that ensures it stays interesting throughout.Typically for an 80's horror movie, the production values and acting aren't exactly brilliant, and for some this will bring the rating down. Really though, you shouldn't tune into this sort of movie if you don't like bad production values as 80's horror films are known for it, and on a personal note; I quite like the atmosphere that cheapness bring to a movie. Speaking of atmosphere, this movie has plenty. The central location of the movie breathes a fantastic horror movie sensuality, which the common image of the cemetery, along with the foreboding dread that the idea of death brings, help to instil a creepy feeling in the viewers mind. Like many horror films that star kids, this one suffers from having annoying kids in it. Although they're not astutely terrible like the kids in some horror movies are, they do still manage to spoil the movie somewhat. However, there is enough horror here to keep genre fans happy, and the way that the story climaxes, along with the central themes of death, ensure that the film is satisfying at it's climax. Still no classic though.",Pet Sematary
27,mm-39,Better than the remake!,8,15 January 2020,Pet Cemetery the original is better than the remake. Remake is great but the original is a good slow burn horror story. The viewer see the slow dangers on going and character development. With the death of a pet sets of a change of events with a neighbor trying to help. The dead patient helps push the story forward with warnings about do not go there. Like a slow moving wreck Pet Cemetery is hard to watch.

29,Smells_Like_Cheese,So many things worse than death,7,22 April 2012,"Stephen King, the man has an incredible fan base and some really good books. The man knows how to create true fear and suspense. He's written so much and naturally many have made his books into films, one of the most famous being Pet Sematary. Taking a typical ""Be Careful What You Wish For"" story and bringing it to life on the big screen. The story was pretty basic, having the opportunity to play God and bring those you love back from the dead has been done before. But Pet Sematary knew how to take something so basic and really give you the genuine chills of a family who was very normal and who's whole life got turned upside down by a high speed road and a pet sematary that was just plain bad news.The Creed family moves into a new home, close to a road where high-speed truckers often carelessly drive by. They befriend their neighbor, Jud Crandall, who tells them about a pet cemetery nearby. Later the dad Louis is working at the University of Maine at Orono hospital, treats a car accident victim, who dies on the operating table, but not before suddenly grabbing Louis and whispering a mysterious and cryptic message to him just before dying. Church, a cat owned by Louis's daughter Ellie, is run over by a truck on the road in front of their house while Rachel, Ellie, and Gage are in Chicago. Jud takes Louis to a burial ground beyond the pet cemetery they visited earlier. He buries the cat underneath a cairn. Church is brought back to life, but is an evil shell of himself; he attacks Louis and reeks of decomposition. Jud tells Louis about the grounds. Louis asks if a person was ever buried in the grounds. Sometime later, Louis's young son, Gage, is tragically run over by a truck on the same road during a picnic and is killed. Louis considers burying Gage in the burial grounds. Jud tries to dissuade him from doing so, telling him that Gage won't come back normal, but Louis wants Gage back so badly that he does it anyways. But be careful what you wish for, because Gage isn't acting like the Gerber baby any more.The make up effects were really good, the corpses of the people and the cat were just disturbing and can easily give you nightmares. Miko Hughes who played Gage at age 3 did an amazing job, for a kid who can't even tie his shoes, he sure can play an evil little boy. Dale Midkiff who plays the dad did a decent job, though over the top at times, he really captures how he looses it so easily and decides that any problem can be answered with this cemetery despite the fact he knows the consequences already. Fred Gwyne who is usually used to giving the scares in the hit TV show The Munsters is now the one warning the family to be careful of the cemetery and he does a great job. One of the things I found that didn't work in the film though was the ghost of the student that Louis failed to save in the school. He comes back to haunt the family to warn them of Louis' intentions with the cemetery, it felt a little too made for TV and didn't quite match the tone of the film. Also the pace can be a bit slow at times cutting the tension. Over all though, the film does work and gives you the chills and making you question what would you do if given the chance to bring someone back. Well maybe you should watch this film before thinking too much about that.7/10",Pet Sematary
30,Rainey-Dawn,Good Thrilling Horror,8,30 October 2014,Pet Sematary is actually a pretty decent horror film. It's not perfect but it is scary at times. It has a mysterious look and feel to the film along with its story that kept me engrossed in it.This is one of the types of films that will have you thinking about bringing back a deceased loved one or beloved pet in real life. Yet I don't think I would want to bring them back to life like in this movie - that would be terrifying.In some ways this movie is a bit sad: the loss of a child - not just a beloved pet. This is where the movie draws you in closer and gets very scary.Yes this is a good horror film that is worth watching - just have your popcorn ready before hand ;) 8.5/10,Pet Sematary
31,disdressed12,"very creepy ""people come back from the dead"" tale",6,22 October 2006,"the movie Pet Semetary is a pleasant surprise.it is much better than i had hoped for.after all,Stepthen King adaptations seem to be hit and miss.the story is quite a creepy concept,though it is not so much about the pet semetary,but an ancient MicMac burial ground which is said to bring back from the dead those who are buried there.problem is,they don't come back quite the same.of course you just know that someone will bury a loved one there,which is when things start to get creepier.Fred Gwynne is very well cast as the slightly odd(elderly) neighbor of the Creed family,who have just moved in next door.the one slight problem i found was that Denise Crosby was almost a bit of a weak link in this story.She seemed out of her depth.otherwise,a very entertaining,creepy tale,to say the least.certainly worth watching. 6* out of 10",Pet Sematary
32,sddavis63,I'd Be Content If They Buried This Movie So That It Never Came Back!,2,24 January 2012,"I really liked Fred Gwynne. With his size and his deep voice (and, of course, his background as Herman Munster!) he is a perfect choice to have a role in this kind of movie. Just by his presence (even though he's playing a nice guy) he brings a sense of ominousness to the story. Unfortunately, Fred Gwynne was about the only thing I found here that I did like about this movie. I've watched a lot of the adaptations of Stephen King stories over the years, and most of them I've quite liked. This would have to rank as the weakest I've seen. Aside from Gwynne, the cast (mostly headed by Dale Midkiff and Denise Crosby as Louis and Rachel Creed along with Gwynne as Judd, their new neighbour) didn't grab me.As the movie begins the Creeds have just moved to a new home, which is located right beside a road filled with speeding trucks all day and night. Judd is their neighbour across the road. Judd shows them around, pointing out a path that leads to a pet cemetery where animals killed by the trucks have been buried. When the Creeds' cat is killed, Judd takes Louis beyond the pet cemetery to an old Micmac burial ground, where those who are buried come back to life - but not quite as they were. Church the cat comes back to life, but as a meaner, more vicious cat. Tragedy then strikes, when the Creeds' young son Gage is killed by a truck, and Dale comes up with the idea of burying Gage's body in the Micmac ground, in spite of a warning from Judd about what could happen. Gage comes back to life too - but not as the sweet, lovable little boy the Creeds knew.The story moved slowly, with really very little of sustained interest or excitement. The main problem is that the basic story was clearly given away by Judd as he told Louis stories about what had happened in the past when animals or people had been buried in the hallowed Micmac ground. What was the point of the flashbacks? I mean, once you know that it has happened, you're pretty sure that it's going to happen again. Perhaps 5 minutes of flashbacks served as a spoiler to the entire movie. Yes, there are a few standard thrills and chills here and there, but nothing really frightening. I wasn't really clear what the point of Rachel's childhood memories of her sick sister was, or why it was necessary for Louis to have such a horrible relationship with Rachel's parents. The kid who keeps coming back from the dead (as a ghost?) to speak to Rachel or her daughter Ellie also struck me as unnecessary. In fact, most of this movie actually struck me as unimportant filler, leading up to an ending that was really quite silly. (2/10)",Pet Sematary
33,thesar-2,I Don't Want to be Buried in a Pet Semetery...I Don't Want to Live my Life Again,8,7 April 2019,"Okay, aside from some CHEESE acting from the gorgeous dad and maybe one bad CGI effect, this movie was fantastic. You want classic King? Here you go.What a complex story of tangled webs people weave. So much going on here, it begs you to go purchase the novel and, well, dig in. I did, in the early 2000s, I believe. LOVED the book and if I recall - again, almost 20 years later - I felt it was pretty faithful. So why a remake 30 years later? Hmmm.But, I digress. Probably really faithful since King, himself, wrote the screenplay. And it's probably his best script.King's obsession with killer trucks continues as a family's cat dies from one and thanks to neighbor Herman Munster, the dad learns to resurrect the pet. But, as Mr. Munster repeats: Sometimes dead is better.Really, that's the most basic synopsis. I thoroughly recommend this great 80s classic. So many layers that gets better with each viewing. Yeah, it's not perfect, but the creep factor is at 9½/10 for the most part and it has a great cast...including the world's cutest boy. You will literally fall in love with the little fella and that makes what happens all the more tragic.On a side note, I get to meet that little boy (probably now 33'ish!) at a horror convention in a couple of months here in town! My friend and I are stoked - her, more so as this is her favorite King movie (and, I believe book, not 100% sure on that one. Movie for sure.)I digress, again. See this movie. Not sure about the Wicker Man'esque remake yet. I might see that tomorrow. And I did see the sequel with a then-crush Edward Furlong once, in theatres. Don't think I liked it and may/may not revisit soon.***Final thoughts: I caught a few new things this time around, but most notably, I don't ever recall hearing that incredible Ramones Title song in the end credits. Had to download it immediately. What a catchy and now top 100, wait 50?, 20s Movie Song for me. I really need to make a list.",Pet Sematary
34,bowmanblue,A very enjoyable mess,8,16 April 2020,"The irony was, when I first watched 'Pet Sematery' I actually couldn't spell 'cemetery' therefore I didn't pick up the deliberate typo in the title! Anyway, it's another eighties Stephen King book-to-film adaptation and, as any horror fan knows, these can be hit and miss. Mainly miss. However, what we have here is a creepy little film which actually stands the test of time.As with most 'King' films, it's set in (or around) Maine where an unusually-happy family moves into a new house... by a road! Yes, the road is a major player in 'Pet Sematery' as it's not long before a truck claims the life of the family's pet cat, Church. Luckily, their well-meaning neighbour, Judd, takes pity on the family and comes up with a novel way of sparing the children the grief of losing a treasured pet - it involves resurrecting it beyond the 'Pet Sematery.'Now, 'Pet Sematery' is a great film. There's lots to enjoy here - it's creepy, well-acted and has plenty of memorable scenes - it's definitely worth a watch. However, it's also not without faults. I haven't read the book, so I can only assume it goes into far greater details as to all the characters' backstories. Here, everyone seems to have a deep backstory which could probably have its own film made about it. Yet all of these tales are only partially touched upon and it's like this story should have been almost a mini-series to really do them all justice.I say the film is 'well-acted,' but whether you consider Fred Gwynne's portrayal of neighbour, 'Judd,' to be good, or just weird is entirely up to you. Personally, I love his performance and the way he seems to speak will certainly stay with you long after the credits have rolled. In fact, if you're a fan of 'South Park' then you'll start to get a lot of references in the cartoon as his character does tend to pop up here and there to explain various supernatural happenings.So, if you can ignore the slightly 'unused' elements of the story which don't really go anywhere, you'll actually get quite a fun and novel (at the time - I still haven't bothered with the remake) horror film. There's quite a lot in it that actually borders on 'disturbing imagery' rather than horror, but when practical effects/make-up are used, they're nicely nasty - if you know what I mean.If you can really watch this film and not enjoy Fred Gwynne's performance then I'll be surprised (and also try not to laugh at a - slightly out-of-place - 'pratfall' that comes about three quarters of the way through the film when someone seems to bang his head on some furniture out of nowhere - Frank Drebin would be proud of that one!",Pet Sematary

The acting is very good!. Dale Midkiff is awesome as the main lead and had great chemistry with Denise Crosby, and was pretty likable. Fred Gynne was excellent as the neighbor although it was hard to understand what he was saying at times he did his job extremely well!. Denise Crosby was awesome here and had great chemistry with Dale Midkiff and did what she had to do well. Miko Hughes was amazing here and did an incredible job for a 2 year old and he was creepy!. Brad Greenquist is fine here and did what he had to do. Blaze and Beau Berhdal were both great and were very likable (surprisingly for children. Andrew Hubatsek was JUST SCARY!!!!!!.

36,Bored_Dragon,One of the best adaptations of Stephen King,8,9 December 2017,"Believe it or not, occasionally someone succeeds to adapt Stephen King story in a good movie. First time I saw it, back when it was released, I was ten years old and I couldn't sleep for a very long time. Also, I shuddered at the very thought of cats or graveyards. Till today it stands as one of the most traumatic movie experiences of my life. Almost three decades later I decided to watch it again and I must admit it is pretty much scary even for a forty years old. Mary Lambert nailed King's atmosphere, story is simple but accurately hits primeval fears in us, and acting is good enough for movie to be convincing. Especially strong impression on me was left by Fred Gwynne and little Miko Huges, who stands shoulder to shoulder with legendary Damien from Omen. Interesting fact is that cult song by Ramones ""I Don't Wanna Be Buried in a Pet Sematary"" was nominated for Razzie Award for Worst Original Song. This is definitely my favorite Ramones song. Anyway, however different our tastes may be, this movie is mandatory for every true horror fan.8/10",Pet Sematary
37,The-Sarkologist,Let the Dead Stay Dead,7,16 September 2017,"I'm not sure if it is my age, or if it is that Hollywood has fresh run out of ideas but it feels as if they simply don't make films like this anymore. Okay, I would hardly call it the perfect film – far from it – but compared to a lot of the mind numbing films out there this film is simply superb. Basically it is the tragedy of a doctor who has moved out to the new England countryside, and it certainly is a tragedy – as one death after another haunts him we see him descend further and further into a madness rocked by grief until he commits a sin so horrendous that it ends in his death. I remember a teacher telling me that the sign of a good tragedy is when you want to scream out to the protagonist to stop but you are powerless and simply end up watching his (or her) descent.Basically he moves to this house and just down a path is a cemetery where pets are buried. He lives on a road that has trucks endlessly roaring down it, which is why there are so many pets buried in the place. However, when his daughter's cat is killed the neighbour shows him another place where if the dead are buried they return to life – but they are changed. The thing is that the dead basically want to stay dead, and when they are yanked out of that peaceful rest they are simply not happy at all – as is the case with the cat.However, grief makes people do stupid things – they simply don't think clearly, and in the throws of grief will lash out and attempt to change the past. The thing with the past is that it simply cannot be changed. Even though it may seem possible to make things right, the more we attempt to make them right, the worse things turn out, so when his life descends into a fit of despair he starts to make decisions that have enormous repercussions. The thing is that it isn't as if he is a bad person – far from it – he is just a normal man who has suffered a great loss, and seeing the opportunity to rectify it he does so, with horrendous consequences.The great thing about this film is that it is focused entirely on the protagonist – it is his story, and it is his descent. Okay, I haven't read the book, but it is something that I would want to attempt to do sometime in the future (if I am able to get my hands on a copy). Actually, I remember watching this film multiple times when I was much younger, so you could probably imagine my joy when I discovered that it was actually on television again.As I mentioned, it isn't a perfect movie, but it certainly ages well. Okay, the lack of modern technology, such as mobile phones, certainly stands out, but that isn't the biggest problem. In part it seems to descend into a slasher flick at the end, but I guess that is the purpose of the film. However, I certainly wouldn't call it a slasher flick, namely because such films have a group of protagonists being killed one by one, and that isn't the case here. However, since it does fall into the horror genre the film makers do make an attempt to ramp up the blood and gore, which isn't necessary at points.The other things that got me is that there seemed to be this friendly ghost – Pascal – but while he spends a lot of time apparently helping the wife, this seems to come to naught. In part he pops in and out to warn people, but in another sense he seems to be leading them, or at least the wife, to her death. The other thing is that he seems to haunt other characters, so I'm am not entirely sure of the nature, purpose, or even need of that particular character. However, for an older film, it is certainly one worth watching, even though it has probably drifted into the mists of history.",Pet Sematary
38,jacobjohntaylor1,not one of Steven king's best.,4,26 January 2018,This movie is not scary. It is just a lot of hype. I has an awful story line. It has an awful ending. Pet Sematary 2 is a lot better. Do not see this movie. Just see Pet Sematary 2. This a 4. Not a 6.6,Pet Sematary
39,paulclaassen,"It gets weird, very weird...",3,18 October 2021,"I wonder how many people actually notice the intentional misspelling of 'Sematary'. The reason, I believe, is because the cemetery is a sacred placed where children bury their beloved pets, and this is the way kids would spell cemetery (sematary).Luckily for me (I guess) I don't read books, so I can't compare the film to the book. So many people hate a movie because it differs too much from the book they so love. I don't have that problem.'Pet Sematary' starts off with a good idea. The film also has several really creepy moments and effects. After a tragedy, a father (well played by Dale Midkiff) does what any father in his position would either consider, or - in this case - be daring enough to do.Initially captivating with compelling characters, the film soon turns very weird very quickly. I mean, really weird! This is one of the rare instances where I prefer the remake (2019's Pet Sematary), because it doesn't get quite as weird as this. This movie also has a dissatisfying ending. As much as I enjoyed the first and second act, the final act completely ruins it (for me).",Pet Sematary
40,poe426,"""Sometimes, dead is better...""",10,18 September 2014,"One of Stephen King's more memorable books (in my own, ever humble opinion), PET SEMATARY is likewise one of the more memorable movie adaptations- thanks in large part to Dale Midkiff as Louis Creed, who goes through a gradual and completely plausible on-screen deterioration. Fred Gwynne is just as memorable as neighborly neighbor Jud Crandall, who reveals the secret of the nearby Pet Sematary to Creed when the family cat, Church, dies. Jud suggests burying the cat in the old Micmac Indian burial ground in the woods beyond the pet cemetery. The next day, the cat returns... with Cattitude. Louis refuses at first to believe that the cat has been returned from the dead, that he must've buried the cat alive, but Jud points out: ""You only stop melting the frost under where you're layin' when you're dead."" Jud becomes visibly upset when Creed asks if anybody ""ever buried a person up there."" At this point, Stephen King puts in a cameo as a priest at the funeral of the Creed housekeeper, Missy, who has committed suicide. We learn, too, that Creed's wife Rachel (Denise Crosby) had a sister, Zelda, who died of spinal meningitis, ""a dirty little secret, in the back room."" In one of the scariest scenes in the movie, Rachel enters the Creed home to find her dead sister crouched in a corner of a bedroom. As she stares at the dead woman in horror, Zelda comes hunched over across the room at her/the camera. The first time I saw this one, it was THIS quick little scene that had me looking for the nearest exit; it's an extremely effective moment in a movie packed with memorable moments.

41,filipemanuelneto,"It's not particularly good, but King's fans will probably want to see it.",5,18 January 2021,"Although his writing is generally brilliant, not all of Stephen King's short stories are in fact appealing and interesting. As with all authors, there are smaller works in the middle of their writing and ""Pet Sematary"" is probably one of them. Even so, this did not prevent three adaptations to be made for the cinema. This film, from the late-eighties, is the first of these adaptations and, in my view, the most faithful to the original tale. It is an average film, which does not disappoint us but which is far from being really good.The script follows King's story with some care: the Creed family has just moved into a country house in order to abandon the stressful routine of urban life, but the house is next to a road with a lot of heavy truck movement, which circulate at high speed and without great care. They immediately become friends with the neighbor across the road, an elderly widower named Jud. It is he who, when asked about a path around the house, introduces them to the Pet Cemetery, where children from the area bury their pets, many of them victims of being run over on the road. Weeks later, when Louis Creed tries to save the life of a young man who dies in his hands after an accident, he is warned by the young man's spirit that he, as well as his family, are in danger. In fact, behind the house, close to the Pet Cemetery, there is an ancient sacred place where the Indians buried their dead, but which was abandoned when it became a cursed place. A place where you shouldn't go, and where the stony soil hides a cruel force.In general, I liked the film and the story, even though it is considerably weaker than much material I have seen, and which is also based on the tales of this author. The idea of the animal graveyard seems to me more tender than threatening, it is a way to keep alive the memory of the animals we love in life. Furthermore, as the film itself reveals over time, all the horror does not come from this cemetery, but from another, older and more isolated one. The film still has some problems of rhythm since it spends the first 45 minutes in dialogues, back and forth, without actually building solid characters with this effort. In fact, if we exclude Louis Creed, Jud and - surprisingly - the cat, the rest of the characters are limited to the basic and do not allow us to make major psychological analyzes. And that feeling of guilt that Rachel Creed carries because of the death of her sister is something that does not do much for the story told, and it also does not help us to like the character.The cast is not brilliant, but does a generally satisfactory job. Dale Midkiff was very good in the role of Louis and Denise Crosby is tender as the mother of the family, but Fred Gwynne goes further and really succeeds, with this film, one of the most notable works of the career that, in fact, would end with a few years later. Brad Greenquist gave life to the ghost but if the character was not particularly interesting the same can be said of his work.Directed by Mary Lambert, it is a lukewarm, irregular film, with a somewhat lazy cast and that suffers from faded, low-contrast and generally ugly cinematography that was taken from the stake in the films of the 1980s. The visual and sound effects are not brilliant, and the sets and costumes are also not particularly surprising, being more or less within what we could expect. Things get much better when the cat comes back, and from now on everything becomes more palatable, bolder and more visually violent. The soundtrack is not in the ear but has good incidental music.",Pet Sematary
42,Rectangular_businessman,The book was so much better,5,28 October 2012,"While ""Pet Sematary"" wasn't too bad (At least, it wasn't so bad as other adaptations of any Stephen King book into a movie, and it was certainly much better than the awful sequel) I think that this film doesn't make any justice to the original book, which was darker and more complex.That being said, I think that, at least, ""Pet Sematary"" was somewhat entertaining to watch, despite (Or maybe because of) some cheesy scenes (Particularly the ending, which includes a laughable special effect failure) On the other side, the atmosphere was pretty well done, there were a couple of interesting scenes, and Fred Gwynne was perfect in the Jud Crandall role.I guess that it could have been much worse. (Like ""Pet Sematary II"".) But there are much better adaptations of the books written by Stephen King, such as the original ""Carrie"" film, ""The Shining"", ""Misery"" and ""1408"".",Pet Sematary
43,leplatypus,even the cat is scary ! (rental),10,28 May 2016,"I can't tell if it's a good movie by itself or just because it's a fine adaptation (by King himself) of one of his best novels : the story is extraordinary by its chilling atmosphere, its slow deadly path towards the unspeakable, its perfect loving family just destroyed by evil ancient dark forces ! The movie has got it all and really hurts, even if it's has more light and less time than my reading memories:as the movie asks me only one evening, while the book needed movie several ones, i think that this time shrinking is also the reason i don't get really afraid watching it: the really strong scenes are a matter of minutes; however, i just couldn't see the scenes with the ill sister no more than i could read the pages about her ! I think the cast is good because we don't really know them ! In all cases, the movie as well as the book is essential because it deals with my highest fear and asks the terrible task of parents of how to deal when their child understand ""the reaper"" ! I don't know other materials that studies this necessary bad moment but here at least it's told with a lot of humanity: sure the action is twisted but we can relate to what happens ! At last, it's just so good to pick a 80s movie because at that time people just wanted to do simple, real, direct movie and not hollow, elitist, violent stories with pretentious visuals like today ! So it's no use to bring the movie back with a reboot or a TV show ! You'll know how it will end !",Pet Sematary
44,TheMovieDiorama,"Pet Sematary teases that ""sometimes dead is better"", including this adaptation.",5,6 April 2019,"More of a supernatural drama than a horror, this Stephen King adaptation (to which he wrote the screenplay) gently touches upon the themes of its source material. Now, having not read the original novel, I can only judge the story based on this interpretation. However, I am familiar with the premise and various characters that exist in the book. With that being said, Lambert's adaptation is an unusual concoction of thematic melancholy fused with mediocre execution that detracts from the creepy premise in its entirety. A family move to a new house which is situated next to a ""Pet Sematary"" that contains an ancient burial ground that brings the dead back to life, but in a murderous state.Death is a heavy subject. Teaching children about the passing of life is a difficult subject, to which various arguments are expressed. Religious interpretations, scientific explanations or imaginative fantasies. We all deal with death differently. Some struggle to let go of their loved ones, and this film conveys that emotional turmoil. Sometimes it works, particularly during family discussions with the daughter, but quite often Lambert and King fluctuate the focus as they are unable to balance the supernatural elements with mainstream horror techniques.Something just felt off, and it wasn't the ""dead"" cat. A drama requires convincing acting in order to convey the necessary emotion that the characters feel. This film boasts some peculiar acting, especially from Midkiff who gives an absolute dreadful performance. His face did not move. His monotony almost singlehandedly destroyed this film. As the vital protagonist, whose diminishing sanity further accelerated the thrills, it was imperative that the father was portrayed accurately as he acts as the audience's eyes. Sadly, not the case here.This is without mentioning the ridiculous amount of stupid scenes, including a funeral brawl, a sudden confession about the wife's sister's crooked back and the most dangerous scalpel ever. Yet, I saved the worst til last. The neighbour, played reasonably well by Gwynne, clearly warned the father ""don't ever bury anything up there, what comes back is something completely different"". So what does the neighbour do? Invite the father to bury a dead cat. Knowing full well that it would be an incredibly bad idea, he still did it because the daughter ""shouldn't have to say goodbye to her favourite pet just yet"". Scenes like this really test my patience, and it's even more surprising when the original novelist writes the screenplay!Lambert's directing technique was also weirdly generic, as if it was a TV movie. It had this cheap aesthetic appeal that rarely felt cinematic, particularly with the production value. Despite the third act raising the much needed tension with its engrossing visual terror (that kid's laugh...), the rest of this adaptation didn't work for me. Poor acting from Midkiff, weak writing and mediocre directing unfortunately detract from an intriguingly ominous premise that infrequently captivates. Unsure why this has a cult following, but best to bury this adaptation in a normal graveyard.",Pet Sematary

Stephen King's name was suffice. Revisited it recently on a dvd which I own since m planning to watch the remake.
The film was very innovative. Found the violence very extreme then but now I found the entire film to be ridiculous. A small kid able to hang an adult? The child attacking scenes looked more like Chucky's.
Inspite of staying next to a main road where every 2 mins a big truck passes in full speed, why no speed breaker? Why no fence wall to guard kids/pets venturing out?
The acting by the main male lead is atrocious. He looked as if he was smiling during intense scenes.

46,insomniac_rod,Successful in two major aspects...,9,25 August 2004,"""Pet Sematary"" succeeds on two major situations. First, it's a scary Horror movie. Those that just aren't produced in these days. Second, it's an emotional, clever movie overall. So if you are looking for chills, scares, creepiness and visually stunning settings, great acting, dialongs, and gruesome effects; this is the movie you are looking for. A classic now and truly a must see for any Horror fan. Probably, the best adaptation to any of King's novels. The events feel a little rushed compared with the novel, but that doesn't means that this underrated movie isn't a complete Horror/Drama accomplishment. Stephen King's novel is widely known for being very emotional and gruesome at the same time. The movie captures the same feeling mainly because there's a great character development and you can feel the loving relationship between it's members. Then, when everything seems to be happiness (technically happy, because the title ""Pet Sematary"" does not offers appiness!) a tragic event changes the movie's atmosphere, now it turns very dark. The movie has a sinister feeling since the opening credits, but after Gage is killed the movie becomes sad, gray, creepy. Dealing with the loss of a baby son is something that can ruin a family's entire life, and ""Pet Sematary"" proves it dramatically. The legend behind the pet sematary is more than a myth that no one wants to experience, but sadness and desperation lead an emotionally destroyed father to give it a shot. Sadly enough, the legend comes true and baby Gage returns from the dead. The previous encounter with the pet sematary legend turned out to be a tragedy but this time it's something much, much worse. What will happened with the lives of our All American family? Could Pascow prevent this tragedy? What is it with the surreal nightmares? Watch ""Pet Sematary"" to witness one of the most touching, emotional Horror movies of recent times. You won't regret. The acting is very good although I didn't dig the actor who portrayed the father. He didn't seem disturbed enough when the situations asked for his desperation. But that's just my opinion. Denise Crosby truly delivered a great performance and worked perfect as the noble, tender mother. Baby Gage was amazing even on his creepy parts. *Shivers*. Overall this is a great classic of all time and a disturbing movie that touches people's deepest fears... the loss of someone you love, the dead returning to life, and a feeling of desperation.Something is for sure... I don't wanna be buried, in a pet sematary!!",Pet Sematary

49,bsmith5552,It's Right Out Back...Just Follow the Path!,7,15 October 2017,"""Pet Sematary"" is another adaptation of a Stephen King novel. Oddly enough, the cemetery is only incidental to the plot. The real center of the story revolves around an old Mic Mac burial ground located above the pet cemetery in an isolated area.A young family, the Creeds, moves to rural Maine from Chicago. The father, Louis (Dale Midkiff) is a doctor taking up a post at the local hospital (I think). His faithful wife Rachel (Denise Crosby) and their two young children, Ellie (Balze Berdahl) and Gage (Miko Hughes) settle in. They meet their neighbor, the mysterious Jud Crandall (Fred Gwynne) who tells them of a ""pet semetary"" located at the end of a path leading from the Creeds property.The Creed home and that of Crandall are separated by a busy highway over which travel large trucks at high speeds. The ""sematary"" apparently was established by the local children to bury their pets that were killed on the highway.At work, Louis tends to the injuries of Victor Pascow (Brad Greenquist). The man dies but in the process vows to help Louis through any crisis, a sort of guardian angel. And yes, only Louis is aware of Victor.When Rachel and the kids go to Chicago for Thanksgiving, Their pet cat ""Church"" is killed. Rather than tell Ellie of the tragedy, Crandall takes Louis to a hidden graveyard once used by the Mic Mac Indians. The grave yard possess magical powers by which a body buried there will rise (rather quickly) from the dead. Louis buries the cat there and lo and behold, the next evening...the cat came back. The rejuvenated pet has become aggressive toward Louis however, he manages to keep his gruesome secret from his family.Now this is where it gets really interesting. One sunny afternoon at a family picnic, little Gage wanders onto the highway and is killed. After a traditional burial, Louis sends his family to Chicago. Louis distraught over his son's death, exhumes his body and despite warnings from Crandall and Pascow, takes the little boy to the Indian graveyard. The little boy comes back to life and................................A lot of blood and gore in this one folks. The make up on the Pascow character is unbelievable. The violence at the film's climax results in much bloodshed. How they got little Miko Hughes (and his dummy double) to do what they do is really amazing. The hanging suicide of washer woman Missy (Susan Blommaert) although gruesome (and well done), adds little to the story line except to provide a venue for Stephen King's cameo.",Pet Sematary

52,jimbo-53-186511,Veers between moments of creepy tension and too many moments of goofy horror,4,1 March 2016,"Pet Sematary is another screen adaptation of a novel by Stephen King - interestingly King actually adapted the screenplay for this film. The sight of the words 'screenplay by Stephen King' across the screen during the opening credits filled me with some confidence and I was honestly expecting Pet Sematary to be a decent offering, but I was so disappointed when the film finished....I think the problem with some of King's adaptations is that they perhaps work better in some cases when the ideas are confined to books. When reading a book (in this case a horror book) you can use your imagination to try to envisage how some of the evil characters may look and sometimes your imagination can possibly conjure up terrifying images - this could mean something as basic as an evil cat trying to intimidate a family could potentially evoke some fear for a reader. However, when this concept is put to screen it doesn't quite work so well - the sight of a cat snarling, growling and flashing yellow eyes just isn't particularly scary, but it has to be said that it is quite a creepy effect. There are other problems such as the undead guy who keeps popping up now and again to give random warnings to Louis & Rachel Creed - this guy is presumably supposed to be creepy and scary, but when seeing him on screen it actually comes across as being more goofy and funny. It's arguable as to whether his presence is necessary in the film at all, but he's not exactly a terrifying presence.As with other King adaptations it seems that 'family dynamics' are important and it's made clear here that this family are the perfect example of a typical Surburban family - they're actually superficially and nauseatingly happy at the start which has probably been done deliberately to make us care more when things start to fall apart for the family. This works to an extent as the family are generally likable, but they're so superficial and poorly developed that I didn't find myself caring for them as people anywhere near as much as I should do. The family dynamics are a bit syrupy here, but they're nowhere near as bad as they were in Cujo which was basically a soap opera for the first two thirds of its run time. In some ways the heavy 'family dynamics' are a problem again because they prevent the film flowing well and as a result it's another King horror adaptation that drags badly and frequently (despite only running for around 95 minutes).King and director Mary Lambert do up the ante in the final third and these scenes provide some of the creepiness and tension that I'd hoped for. The idea that the dead people come after those that they feel are responsible for their death created an interesting angle in the narrative, but sadly it's barely explored and although the final scenes are well-staged and fairly suspenseful I do feel that it barely explored its own concepts leaving the narrative a little threadbare. As a side note, the film also looks cheap and has a real 'TV Movie' feel about it which didn't really help to be honest. Oh yeah and the ending was beyond weird!!!!! For me, this stacks up as one of the weaker King adaptations, but for what it's worth I still thought that it was slightly better than both Cujo and Christine.",Pet Sematary

54,Foreverisacastironmess123,"""Never get out of bed again!"" Teaches the true meaning of horror...",10,16 March 2019,"A happy family move into a house not far from a secret burial ground where the interred people and animals are resurrected as twistedly evil or deranged versions of their former selves, and when tragedy strikes and the malign forces are unleashed, a man comes to deplore what he thought he wanted, as a family is destroyed forever... Firstly, as a Stephen King adaptation, I always absolutely thought that this was one of the finest and most unfairly underrated ones ever made, and it's certainly one of the scariest! I read that brilliant book several times and found it to be one of the most uncompromisingly brutal and chilling things I ever read, King really channeled some serious inner darkness into it, and this film doesn't ignore or neglect that whatsoever, and to me is an extremely faithful reflection of a truly frightening story. Of course it couldn't have ever gotten every last plot point, character, and plain rich nuance totally right, but to me it does capture the core essence of the pain, madness and grim dark tones of the story, and of learning the hard way that some things are best left buried... Some things you can never capture on film but it stayed as close as it could without any major deviations including the ending, starting as a tale of family tragedy and then gradually escalating into something much more fantastically nightmarish, and the horror element of the story becomes almost tangible as it reaches its truly creepy climax. It's got so many scenes and moments that are more than capable of giving me chills and disturbing me, it's so awful and lonely when the stubborn suffering woman commits suicide, and when Rachel has a nightmare of Zelda on the bed saying she's going to get her and cackling like a witch, it just can't not move you when Louis is forced to put down his now evil little son like an animal while, just to make the moment all the more devastating it flashes images of the innocent beautiful child he once was... To this day it's still a jolt of a scene that hits you right in the gut when Gage is killed right in front of his family on a picture perfect day, it's like an inevitable nightmare moment that's all slowed down and everyone is so powerless to do anything just because they turned their backs for a minute. The truly epic ""No!"" is a bit melodramatic I grant you, but it sure gets you, and it's a heartbreaking and powerful moment of acting from Dale Midkiff. You don't see Gage get stuck down or Rachel get butchered by her own twisted baby who takes advantage of her moment of weakness, but you don't even need to, your mind fills in the rest and I love that, it's a movie that displays a real subtlety at certain points. It tickles me the way that Pet Sematary is such an intensely grim film that the only real levity in it comes from the gruesome spectre of a young man who himself suffered a violent sudden death earlier in the story and looks frankly terrifying, but is essentially a bloody guardian angel who tries to prevent the disaster from happening to Louis and ultimately fails. Fred Gwynne was just so spot on, and he was so rich and warm with what he brought that he really made an iconic little character in his portrayal of Jud and he probably went a long way to make the whole movie work by virtue of his performance alone, and for good reason. A lot of fans love his famous ""dead is better"" line the most, but I like what he says right at the end, it's so resonantly sad and eerie in that moment as the likely now insane Louis waits for the love of his life to come home... The magnificently saddening score adds a whole lot of emotional depth and impact, and just imbued the movie with a powerful sense of loss, rising dread, and horror, and it's very dour but that tone and the themes kind of force you to linger on very depressing things like death and mortality, but that's a lot of what its theme is all about, it's not saying that loss and death is fair and just, but that in its own terrible way it's essential to the cycle of life, giving us meaning and finality and reminding us of what is truly precious. So in closing it's as cold as the grave and black as midnight but I love this movie, it's chilling, and it holds up well. Greater book, great classic horror movie.",Pet Sematary
55,yusufpiskin,"""You burry your own.""",8,15 February 2020,Hands down one of the greatest horror films I've ever seen. You really feel for all the characters and can grieve when tragedy strikes. It has so many iconic scenes and lines.Fred Gwynne's performance is so iconic. He delivers what Stephen King could only hope for. The rest of the cast was just as great. Mikko Hughes is phenomenal in this. He is THE CREEPIEST HORROR MOVIE KID ever. It's weird to know that he is the son of John Hughes (director of The Breakfast Club).I love this movie. I've seen it so many times. There's nothing else like it. I first saw this when I was ten. It scared me then and still does eleven years later. Zelda was the scariest thing about this movie.

56,drownnnsoda,"Good Horror Film, The Book Was Better Though.",7,23 November 2006,"""Pet Sematary"" is an adaptation from the Stephen King novel of the same title. The story follows the Creeds - an all American, middle-class family, who move into a house out in the country. The family consists of Louis and Rachel, and their two young children, Ellie and their toddler son, Gage. The house couldn't be better, and the family meets a strange but friendly old man, Jud, who lives across the road. He leads them down an old path into the woods one day where a pet graveyard lies - filled with a huge amount of animal graves. And just beyond there, lies a sacred Indian burial ground that seems to possess a strange power. When the family cat, Church, is killed, Louis sees it fit to bury him in the pet cemetery - and strangely enough, soon after, Church returns to life. But there's something evil about him now, he isn't the same cat he used to be. And when a tragic accident takes the life of young Gage, Louis decides to apply the same concept in hopes of reviving his dead son... unfortunately, he gets more than he bargained for.Having read Stephen King's novel, I can say that the book is much better than the film. Not to say the movie is bad, because it isn't - the book is just a little bit better. The real strength in this film lies in it's story, which is both bizarre but extremely original, something that King's stories are typically known for. The script is very well adapted from the story, and while it minorly differs in some aspects, it's a pretty good page-to-screen transformation. There are a few plot holes here and there, nothing major though. Besides that, this movie is actually pretty scary, and it succeeds in it's intention to do so. There are some really disturbing scenes throughout the film, and I'd have to say that the flashback sequence of Rachel's sister Zelda is the number one. Honestly, that is one of the most disgusting, disturbing things I've ever seen in a horror film - it's not gory and bloody, it's just flat out sickening. One thing's for sure, that image won't leave your head anytime soon.The performances in this film were all very up to par and I really had no problem there. This film is actually on the gory side, there are plenty of nasty little sequences to please all of the gore hounds out there, including the shocker of an ending. I really liked the way they ended the film, it was abrupt and somewhat inconclusive, but it worked better that way with all things considered.Overall, ""Pet Sematary"" is a good horror movie that I'd recommend to those who are fans of either Stephen King or just fans of the genre in general. The story is the film's greatest asset and it's a creepy one too. One of the better Stephen King adaptations I'd say. 7/10.",Pet Sematary
57,Pairic,Pretty good shocker,8,15 December 2019,"Pet Sematry: Just watched the 1989 version again, doesn't have as much of a Folk Horror feel as the 2019 film but holds up well. Church the cat is more frightening and the student with his brains hanging out is more convincing as a messenger/guide. Rachel's sister is less terrifying in this version but given her illness the restraint is probably just as well. Differs significantly from the 2019 production in narrative development and outcome. Director Mary Lambert delivered a pretty good shocker. 8/10.",Pet Sematary
58,gcd70,A nightmare of slasher proportions,3,19 March 2008,"What was obviously a chilling, haunting premise (and probably a riveting novel) was poorly adapted from his own work by horror author Stephen King, and became a real schlocker.Rather than go for the subtlety and slight of hand that would have made ""Pet Sematary"" a real treat, King and director Mary Lambert have foolishly opted for a gruesome, shocker style show that turns this potentially ghostly pic into a nightmare of slasher proportions.""Pet Sematary"" ends up too much like the ""Halloween"" and ""Friday the 13th"" films that go for maximum gore and adrenalin shock to cover for zero story. But King's novel certainly wasn't lacking in plot substance, yet has not been utilised.Plenty of over the top make-up effects have oozed their way on to the screen, to the delight I'm sure of hard core horror fans, but to the complete disgust of the rest of us. Elliot Goldenthal provides some suitably chilling music though.The cast meanwhile are simply a non-plus. What a shame the likable Fred Gwynne (one ""Herman Munster"" of T.V. fame) has wasted his talents in this big screen effort. Wasted also is King's big chance to prove himself a formidable screenwriter. Never mind Stephen, you'd better stick to literary creations.Sunday, June 9, 1996 - Video",Pet Sematary
59,Witchfinder-General-666,"Certainly No Horror Masterpiece, But Watchable",6,6 March 2007,"An average but entertaining Stephen King film, Mary Lambert's ""Pet Sematary"" of 1989 is certainly no horror highlight, but worth watching nevertheless. The film gets rather cheesy occasionally, but it definitely has some very creepy moments and will keep you entertained if you don't expect too much.Chicago doctor Louis Creed (Dale Midkiff) moves to the countryside with his wife (Denise Crosby) and his two kids. Their new house is roomy and beautiful, and their new home would almost be perfect if it wasn't for the trucks which constantly pass their house at high speed and the (misspelled) pet cemetery behind their house. The Creeds' new neighbor Jud Candrall (Fred Gwynne), a likable and friendly elderly man, is not to keen on talking about the mysterious 'pet sematary' and soon after their arrival, Louis Creed is warned about the cemetery in an eerie encounter...""Pet Sematary"" definitely has a few moments which are creepy enough to keep the viewer entertained. Most of the performances are regrettably below average, a fact that wouldn't bug me in a typical B-movie, but since this movie is built up as kind of a Hollywood-style horror flick, the acting could certainly be better. Two exceptions are the performances of Fred Gwynne, who fits perfectly into his role of the elderly neighbor Jud, and Brad Greenquist, who is responsible for some of this movie's most eerie moments. Some nice camera work too, nothing phenomenal, but certainly pretty well photographed.Over all, ""Pet Sematary"" is certainly no masterpiece of horror, but nevertheless an enjoyable film and worth watching. 5/10",Pet Sematary
60,TOMNEL,"The production values, acting and script are fine....it's the awful story's fault this time.",2,17 May 2008,"Stephen King is generally known for the morbid, and that's fine, but this story is too morbid. Some movies, by the end you feel sad for the characters or the situations they were put through...here you just feel depressed. The movie has a nice feel to it (at first), with the family moving to the country, and creepy old Fred Gwyne greeting and warning them of the pet cemetery, but this plot leads nowhere. It starts with so much potential, but by the end, it loses the potential to be a good horror movie, and becomes corny, extremely stupid, and ultimately depressing.Louis (Dale Midkoff), his wife Rachel (Denise Crosby), their kids Ellie and Gage, and their cat move to a new home in Maine. They are warned by the loony farmer neighbor Jud (Fred Gwyne) about the local pet cemetery and how it is cursed. Louis thinks nothing of this and everything's fine until the family cat is killed. He bury's it in the cursed cemetery and it comes back to life, constantly hissing at the family and wanting to be left alone. One day, infant Gage runs out in the road and is run over and killed by a truck, and Louis knows he must bury him in the cemetery. When Gage comes back to life, he is changed and wants to murder.With many of Stephen King's works that don't translate well into films, I blame the directors and screenwriters. In this case, Mr. King was the screenwriter, but I'm going to blame him for his awful story. By the end it's so pointless, and though unfunny, the premise is laughable. A little boy comes back from the dead and manages to kill people with what looks like a tiny scalpel, and not only that, but he manages to lift their bodies and in one case, carry a body from the ground to the attic!(?) I know this isn't set in reality but seriously, how stupid can this get? The scene where Louis injects his deceased, now living again cat to kill it is strangely sad, because the cat did not deserve this. All it did was go around minding it's own business and he killed it. The scene where he injects his own infant son is almost unbearable. Not unbearably sad, but the whole situation is just awful to think of. After being injected Gage staggers drunkenly around before falling down dead....why did they need to make a movie ending with the death of an infant? But...even worse, the actual ending of them film involving Louis burying someone else (Not going to give away who) in the cemetery after Gage kills them....what did he expect? Why did Mr. King write this horrible story and why was it made into a movie? It's depressing and pointless!My rating: * out of ****. 90 mins. R for violence.",Pet Sematary
61,aidanratesmovies,Sometimes Dead is Better...,9,28 February 2021,"Truly one of the more underrated Stephen King adaptations, Pet Sematary may be a bit silly at times- but it also proves to be wonderfully twisted, well shot, and quite ahead of its time. I'll start out with the films flaws, the acting for the most part is nothing special. By far the greatest asset this film has though is the performance of Fred Gwynne as Jud Crandall, which ranks among my favorite King film performances of all time. The rest of the cast is kinda meh, Dale Midkiff does rise more as a better actor throughout the film, but his somewhat lackluster start kinda weighs down his performance. The film is a bit silly at times, hard to take seriously in some later moments, but it's so campy that you won't mind- especially when it comes to little Gage. I love the story of this film, and its excellently executed throughout the film. It can move a bit fast at times, a bit slower at others, but I found it rather entertaining- and was never really bored while watching it. It does a good job at balancing emotion and and the horror involved both internally and physically in the situations involved. In the end, Pet Sematary is a fun little 80's horror flick that just may be one of my favorite King adaptations.

62,TheFearmakers,"Just Kinda There, But Not God Awful",5,20 March 2020,"For a movie about a city family moving to the country to ""slow down,"" PET SEMETARY rushes through the first half with choppy editing, often seeming like a prolonged trailer...Which only works in that youngest son Gage, the primary focus of the original, is pretty much forgotten, replaced by an older sister, whose age is far more suited to horror movie curiosity: And fans of either the Stephen King novel or the 1989 adaptation know exactly where curiosity gets you...Kudos to the filmmakers for having four stunt cats instead of a single one made of CGI, which has been the trend lately. But family feline Church is more irritable than antagonistic...Meanwhile, dad has his own foreboding ghost while mom's dead sister flashbacks hardly even try surpassing the most nightmarish aspect of the original (even the name Zelda sounds spooky). What's intentionally the most eerie/creepy device are the animal masks worn by young cemetery dwellers...The main problem is that this titular location at night seems part of a set, and is hardly important to the film except that John Lithgow's old local Jud (played more mysteriously by Fred Gwynne before) knows his way around, showing an intense yet fairly dull father/husband Jason Clarke how everything works...So when what happens happens, it's both predictable and, for the most part, pointless and worst of all, not very frightening...Providing the new child menace, portrayed in a Linda Blair EXORCIST fashion by Jeté Laurence, some decent moments that would have fared better in her own vehicle.

63,masonsaul,Weak Stephen King adaptation,4,7 April 2019,Pet Sematary isn't scary at all. The acting is good for the most part but there are a few moments that are over the top.

There are some plot holes in the third act as well as truly laughably bad moments (which do make it really enjoyable for the wrong reasons).,Pet Sematary
64,vertigo_14,"Oh, that whiny daughter! (minor spoilers)",6,30 January 2005,"Pet Semetary is one of the few Stephen King-based movies that I can actually tolerate, and I still think that, save for the constant interruptions of bad acting from little Ellie Creed, the whiny daughter, this is one of my favorite horror movies because it uses most of the elements of a good horror movie (at least in 80s terms).Creed, party of four, moves into the empty house in a rural farm town when Louis Creed (Dale Midkiff) fills the vacancy as the town's doctor. But, the storybook life is shattered when the well-meaning neighbor, Judd Crandall (Fred Gwynn, playing the token cautionary figure and serving as much of the back story for this tale, but giving his finest thick Maine drawl in the meantime), takes the family to the path beyond the house to the 'Pet Semetary.' But where this innocent cemetery is where the dead speak (through their markers, as Judd explains), beyond the cemetery are the sour burial grounds where the dead will walk. And though Judd warns that things don't return as you remember them, he still encourages Louis to bury his daughter's dead cat there. And that is just the first thing that is buried there...I think this is indeed one of the Stephen Kings better movies based on his novels. It is not quite as long-winded or slow-moving as, say, Salem's Lot. Though it is sporadically marred by some bad acting (but not from Fred Gwynn), and though the story is forced on the viewer too simply (most of the conflict is explained by Judd or the Pascow, the ghost that attempts to guide the Creeds) and with some plot holes (Judd never says why, after his experiences with the burial grounds, he takes Louis up there simply to bury a dead cat), the movie contains the perfect number of elements for a good horror movie; spooky music (especially towards the end), imagery (especially the wife's disgusting sister, Zelda and the shape of Judd's house at the end), and story (despite several flaws). Best of all, they did not acquiesce to the happy-ending (though King does this in several films).They made a sequel several years later, which has barely survived obscurity, save a few airings on television every now and again. And, though I might recommend it to see Jared Rushton before he bowed out of making films, I would consider the first the only of any merit.",Pet Sematary
65,Reviews_of_the_Dead,Brooding Look at Life and Death,8,15 April 2019,"This was a film that I originally saw when I was seeking out films based off the works of Stephen King. This happened around when I was a freshman in high school and I started to read his books. I wanted to become a more well-rounded horror fan, so really delving into his films to start. I've seen this film a few times, but only I think three times all the way through. The official synopsis for this film is after tragedy strikes, a grieving father discovers an ancient burial ground behind his home with the power to raise the dead.We start with a family arriving at their new house. They are moving from Chicago to Maine. Louis Creed (Dale Midkiff) is a doctor and he wants to work in a more quiet practice at the local branch of the university. With him are his wife Rachel (Denise Crosby) and their two children. We have Ellie (Blaze Berdahl) and their baby Gage (Miko Hughes). Their house is right next to a busy road and across the street is their new neighbor, Jud Crandall (Fred Gwynne). As they are moving in Ellie notices a path that leads away from their house.Louis' first day is a bit more eventful than he wanted. Ellie learns some choice language from their housekeeper, Missy Dandrdige (Susan Blommaert), and their cat Church is going to be fixed so he doesn't explore as much. The path that we saw earlier leads to a Pet Sematary, with the sign misspelled like that. We see that through a couple interactions, Rachel has issues with death and this puts pressure on Louis. To make his day even worse, a jogger is hit by a truck and brought into his office. The man is Victor Pascow (Brad Greenquist). There's nothing that can be done for him, but he does tell Louis that a man's heart is rocky and he grows what he can.We are given that Rachel's family doesn't like Louis. They go Thanksgiving without him and during their time away, Church is hit by a truck. Jud decides to show Louis a secret place to bury the cat, which is on ancient Indian burial ground. Church then comes back, but he isn't quite himself. Louis asks about if anyone buried a person up there and it upsets Jud. More tragedy befalls this family and Louis is faced with a decision, one that will change his family forever.The first thing I really wanted to point out about this film is that it is quite depressing and is centered on death. Louis is tasked with trying to explain it to Ellie who doesn't quite understand yet. Rachel is extremely bothered by the thought of death. She actually snaps at Jud when he takes them to the Pet Sematary for the first time. She looks at it like a bad thing, but Jud explains that it helps the children to understand life better. The film also has the concept of grief being too much that you make irrational decision. We also reason with ourselves, even if we know what we are saying isn't right. This brings up the line that Jud and Pascow tell to Louis, that a man's heart is stony and it can only grow what it can, which in the case for Louis, is hurt and grief.Now Rachel is an interesting character to me. We learn in this film why she hates death so much and it was because we was tasked at times to look after her sister, Zelda (Andrew Hubatsek). She had spinal meningitis, which caused her to go insane and twist her into a monster. Rachel's parents we are kind of given are well to do, but are actually kind of horrible. This was a traumatizing event for her that she never recovered. It is interesting though.I have read the novel and I will say, the book delves more into why the ground has soured and what happened there. It is actually that a Wendigo, which is Native American evil entity of the woods, turned the land how it is now. Watching it in the past, I was upset they cut this part out. I can see now though that it is there, but they never state what it is. There are some uneasy times from it.Really the last aspect of the story I want to cover before moving on is that of advisors of Louis. I heard on a podcast questioning why Louis is shown the barrier to the soured grounds. Pascow visits him at night and takes him to the Sematary. He tells him not to go over, but my question is, why show him that? It seems like he is already starting the seed even if it is a warning. I get why Jud did what he did. The other thing though, I like the idea that the sour Earth curses those that use it. We never hear of Jud marrying in the film or having a family. There are talks that the curse is what happens to Louis and I really like this. It becomes a black cloud that just continues to grow as it latches on to someone.This brings me to the pacing of the film, which I think is good. It really gets started from the beginning to introduce us to different things and building up story points from the beginning. I thought this was good for the tension. I also feel like no matter what these characters do, the events cannot be stopped and that takes me back to the curse aspect of it. I really like the ending and the implications that come from it as well.This then brings me to the acting, which actually was hit or miss for me. Midkiff I wasn't the biggest fan of. He comes off a little bit too brooding early on in the film. I guess the implication here is that he under a lot of pressure from his wife and her family, but I just didn't feel the change in him. I will say though he does show some really good grief though. Gwynne is great as the wise old man, but he is also flawed in the things he shows to Louis. I thought Crosby was fine. Greenquist I almost feel like his character should have been reworked. I like what he does in the film and his performance, but they show him early and then he disappears for a long stretch. I thought Berdahl, Hughes and Hubatsek were all solid and the rest of the cast round out the film for what was needed.Next we come to the effects of the film, which are quite good. I thought the look of Pascow and those that come back to life looked good. I really have to commend what was done for Zelda and for Rachel. Those might be the too creepiest looking make-up in the film. The blood looks good, even thought there's not a lot. We get most of the effects late in the film. All I'll say in conclusion is Achilles' tendon and mouth slit, the effects were strong.The last thing would be the soundtrack and sound design. I thought both were well done. The music selections and some of the cues were well placed to help amp up the tension. The main title song seemed to be a variation of the original The Amityville Horror main theme and it fit very well. The Ramones also did a song for this film of the same title which is fun as well. For this, I'd say it was pretty solid.Now with that said, I was really glad to check this film out in the theater. It was one that I've seen parts of many times, but seeing it that way was quite interesting. I think there are a lot of deeper meanings on a subject we don't really like to talk about, which I enjoyed. There's a lot in the novel and I think director Mary Lambert did well at bringing that to the big screen. The acting I thought was fine. The editing of the film does build tension throughout and the score helps there as well. The effects were good. I would definitely say to give this one a viewing if you haven't seen it, especially if you are a King fan. I found this to be a good movie.",Pet Sematary

69,PredragReviews,"""Do you know what a graveyard really is?""",8,10 May 2016,"Pet Sematary is by far the most disturbing horror film I have ever seen. From the creepy opening credits to the tragic ending you will either be creeped out or disturbed by this movie. The most unnerving part of the film is that you can't root for the killers demise because he is an innocent little boy who did nothing to deserve what happened to him, it is a complete injustice. The fact that Rachel Creed (Denise Crosby) is seen with red, swollen, tear filled eyes after her little boy is taken away from her only makes the tragedy seem real.The acting here is adequate. Fred Gwynne steals the show, and is largely the only thing that holds it all together. Dale Midkiff does some wonderful round the bend acting towards the finale. Brad Greenquist is having (too much} fun playing the ghost of Pascow, but for what it is its good acting. The only actor who truly made me feel emotion though was Michael Lombard as Rachel Creed's father. I guess he didn't get the memo that this was all goofy fun because his heartbreak at Gage's funeral is keenly felt. Too bad the rest of them didn't miss the memo as well. In short, the actors did what they were asked to do and they did it well for the most part. No real complaints.

They meet neighbor Jud Crandell (Fred Gywnne) who warms them of a path near their house that goes into the woods to a local pet cemetery. After getting settled in, Jud takes the family up to the cemetery and his talk of the dead spooks Ellen. While on his assignment, Louis treats a guy who got ran over by a car, but after he dies, he sees the dead kid in a series of visions. It leads Louis back to the cemetery who reveals a cryptic secret about the graveyard. He never remembers the experience, but awakes with his evidence of the journey. He keeps his experience hidden from the family as they leave to go to her father's for Thanksgiving. While they're gone, Ellen's cat dies and Louis decides to bury it, but Jud has a better idea and together raise the cat from the dead in a secret spot beyond the cemetery. When they come back from their trip, the cat is alive and well. After several days being back, Gage dies in a terrible and horrific truck accident. Ellen takes it almost as bad as Rachel, as they were good friends. Jud tells Louis that he better not bury Gage in the special spot, like the cat, but Louis does it anyway and brings Gage back to life. Ellen begins having visions of the guy that Louis first met and says that he was sent to warn him about Louis and Gage. Rachel also begins hearing his visions, and starts to suspect something might be wrong. After being resurrected, Gage begins to terrify Jud and Louis, and he and Rachel have to stop him from murdering their friends.The Good News: Not a whole lot to talk about here. The main thing, which I like the movie for, is it is the first movie in a long time to capture an essence about it that perfectly mirrors Hammer films. Instead of delivering shocks and jumps constantly, 'Pet Cemetery' wants you to pay attention to the atmosphere it builds up in the beginning and it concludes in the ending. It relies more on its fine cast more than on gore and shocks. The good news is that there is some gore in here, and it is very well done. The blood isn't really graphic, as in 'Friday the 13th' style, but more necessary to the story. In other words, it wasn't gory for the sake of being gory, but rather to push the storyline along. Along with that, that is pretty much it.The Bad News: This takes forever to get started. It lasts about an hour and a half, but the main plot kicks in about fifty minutes into the movie. To me, there's nothing more irritating when a movie offers up a plot then abandons it and starts a new plot. There are a few out there who do that, but this one irritates me more because it happens so late in the movie that I thought the plot up to that point was very interesting. If it would've continued with that plot, I think it would've been a lot better movie.The Final Verdict: While they are a lot better Stephen King adaptations, there are also a lot worse ones you could watch than this. It has its moments, but those are pretty rare, if that matters. With this one, I offer caution: see it if you love Stephen King and his adoption, but use judgment if you care that the movie you watch is all that interesting.Rated R: Graphic Violence, Adult Language, and Adult Themes about death",Pet Sematary
72,Lady_Targaryen,"Sometimes, being dead is better.",7,4 September 2006,"Louis Creed, a doctor from Chicago, moves to a large house near a small town, since he is going to be giving classes in the University of Maine's. Along with him, is his wife Rachel and their two kids, Ellie and Gage,as well as Ellie's cat, Church. Soon, they met their new neighbor,and old man named Judd Crandall.Judd not only warns Louis and Rachel about the danger that is the highway that runs past their house(that is constantly a way used by big trucks) but also show to the family a pet cemetery that is located near their house. Judd starts to talk about the importance of the pet cemetery, but Rachel is against to talk about death and spirituality with her children, since she has traumas from her sister Zelda's death.During the first week of the family in the new house, Louis already has dead people to deal with: Victor Pascow, a student who has been fatally injured in an automobile accident, addresses his dying words to Louis personally, even though the two men are strangers. On the night following Pascow's death, Louis experiences what he believes is a very vivid dream in which he meets Pascow, who leads him to the pet cemetery and warns Louis to not ""go beyond, no matter how much you feel you need to."" Louis wakes up in bed the next morning convinced it was only a dream, until he discovers his feet and the bedsheets covered with dirt and pine needles. Anyway, he dismisses the dream. Many strange things starts to happen and Church, Ellie's cat, dies while walking on the highway. Louis stays worried in how he is going to talk about Church's death with Ellie, but Judd, sympathizing with him, Jud takes Louis to the pet cemetery, supposedly to bury Church. But instead of stopping there, Jud leads Louis farther on a frightening journey to ""the real cemetery"": an ancient burial ground that was once used by the Micmac ('...Indians...'). There Louis buries the cat on Jud's instruction, with Jud saying that animals buried there have come back to life. And that is where the real horror story begins...I personally find this movie very good. It's not THE most horrifying of all, but it is one of the best horror movies I watched. The way Gage dies, is almost impossible to not stay in your memory, specially being a toddler. It's cool to see Stephen King's cameo as the minister of the funeral.Of course, there are some script errors: How can a rich doctor with two small kids, goes to live in a place where there is a dangerous highway near his house? How Gage has no scratches or anything after being hit by a truck? Why Louis continues to resurrect every member of his family knowing they are all going to stay like monsters? Things like that doesn't make any sense, but I can understand that all horror's scripts needs to have some surreal ideas to work.A good thing I saw in this movie, is the necessity to talk about death with the children, no matter what is your religion or if you are an atheist, and also that avoiding important subjects doesn't help anything. Because of Louis being afraid to be honest with Ellie, confronting her and saying that her cat wouldn't be back again, all the nightmare began.",Pet Sematary
73,SusieSalmonLikeTheFish,Spooky and fun to watch,8,29 July 2014,"The Creeds are a happy family: Louis the dad, Rachael the mom, Ellie the daughter, Church the pet cat and Gage the baby son. They move to a beautiful house in Maine, and meet their kindly neighbor Jud, an old man who has lived in the area his entire life. He warns about the Orinco chemical factory trucks that speed down the road day and night, and when the family discovers the Pet Sematary behind their house in the mes of woodland, Jud explains to Ellie that there is nothing to be afraid of there. After Church is run over in the road, Jud takes Louis further past the pet sematary into the old Micmac natives' burial ground to dispose of the cat. The next day it comes back to life and jumps out at Louis while he's in the crawlspace. It also leaves a dead rat in the bathtub. Louis asks Jud if they'd accidentally buried Church alive, but as it turns out, Church is a living dead creature, and for bringing things back to life in the burial ground, there's a price to pay... I often get a little bored by King's movie adaptations, I was not impressed by Firestarter (1984). However, Pet Sematary remains suspenseful 'till the end. The acting of the characters, especially Jud, was great. As the story unfolds, it turns out that a traumatic event in Rachael's past left her terrified of death, and her mom likes Louis but her dad finds Louis a bad husband for his beloved daughter. The soundtrack was pretty eerie, there was a brief funny moment when an overweight Orinco truck driver is singing off-key to a Ramones song on the radio. The beginning theme was very creepy. One scene always haunted me, the part where during Jud's childhood his beloved dog spot comes back from the dead after being killed in rusty barbed wire. Holy cow that dog was horrible, totally scary! And Jud's death was absolutely horrifying. Because of Stephen King being a Ramones fan, the band performed a song especially for the movie, which played during the end credits. The movie trails slightly from the book; rather than Jud's wife Norma, Jud is single and the character has been replaced with a depressed young woman named Missy who does laundry for a living, and she hangs herself after finding out she has cancer and will not survive remission. Great movie, if you're a fan of creepy horror or Stephen King, check it out!",Pet Sematary
74,pyrocitor,"Hey, ho, so-so",6,4 May 2017,"""For sale: baby shoes. Never worn.""Six words, attributed to Ernest Hemingway, comprising 'literature's greatest tragedy,' that could just as easily pierce the heart as literature's purest horror story. Exhibit A: Stephen King's Pet Sematary, which extrapolates all the devastation of the phrase into something altogether more sickeningly, shamefully empathetic. With a sardonic, throbbing fatalism, King's novel corrodes humanity's most primal fear (death of a child) into a damning Sophie's Choice (what if you could bring back an unholy shadow of them), and the most horrifically empathetic addiction allegory imaginable (you wouldn't. you can't. you are) - and all before any of the customary horror scares rear their grisly heads. No wonder King deemed it so borderline unethically terrifying he almost refused to publish it. Unfortunately, it's a wealth of chilling, philosophical profundity that director Mary Lambert seems largely ambivalent to, when there are jump-scares to be had. She glibly springboards off King's soul-chilling conceit into a quagmire of camp, whizzing past character beats and grim foreshadowing with hyper abandon before going straight for the scare jugular. And her spooky setpieces are, for the most part (the less said about Church, the daftly overplayed horror cat, the better), darn good. Boldly accentuated by Elliot Goldenthal's eerie score, Lambert milks her gory, body horror interludes with the schlocky, squishy grossness of an early Sam Raimi. She exploits the alarmingly believable oozing prosthetics of a mutilated Victor Pascow and the traumatic spectre of a sister mawkishly contorted with spinal meningitis with carnivalesque glee, before plunging into the cackling, knife-wielding-toddler Chucky antics of the third act with cheerful aplomb. She's even cheeky enough to play the the narrative's tragic turning point as a devilish, teasing exercise in morbid, cross-cutting Hitchcockian suspense, as if cinematically bringing to life the laugh/cringe paradox of the average 'dead baby joke' - a darkly apropos comparison. And herein lies Pet Sematary's biggest conundrum: Lambert wants to have her cake and eat it too. She tangibly wants to dive into full Sam Raimi b-movie bedlam, but bridles herself out of seeming obligation to the devastating solemnity of, y'know, the whole dead child thing. The disparity, unsurprisingly, sits palpably uncomfortably, while the script's truncation of the hardships of King's plot without his darkly knowing prose plays as more ridiculous than claustrophobically interconnected. It doesn't help that Lambert is noticeably out of her element handling melodrama, and most of the film's moments of (purportedly) sincere heartbreak play as so wooden they evoke more cringes than her aforementioned oozing, exposed cerebellum. Still: clumsy editing, flat exposition, and vacuous character development are one thing (okay, three things). But seriously: not one. Not two. But three Darth Vader calibre ""NOOOOOOOO""s, all underscoring pivotal emotional moments? Better make that cake a cheesecake - and a fairly stale, rotting one, at that. If anything, the proper cast could have helped salvage, and tonally reconciled, Lambert's confused direction. This is not that cast. Instead, Dale Midkiff gives a lead performance so atrociously flat, it'd be safe to give him the benefit of the doubt of him deeply embodying PTSD shock, were his fluctuations in modulation not so amusingly inconsistent with the mandated emotional responses of any given scene. Denise Crosby fares better, even if her anxious fretting may toe the line of a histrionic camp more appropriate for a movie starring gigantic, telepathic alien slugs more often than not. Conversely, Fred Gwynne is rustic perfection as Jud Crandall, the local voice of homespun reason, and Gwynne, working with an unsympathetically hacked up scripted character, essays Crandall's difficult shift from amiable to ominous to achingly sympathetic with consummate, barrel-chested, granite-voiced ease. Still, the show-stealing performance belongs to two-year old(!) Miko Hughes as the story's requisite murderous, resurrected infant, his tiny face emoting to such a viscerally terrifying extent you would swear his expressions were augmented by CGI were the film made in a contemporary context. King's story is so gosh-darn good (good enough to even warrant its egregious, Inglourious Basterds style misspelling) that, even told as clumsily as it is here, it's replete with frights, gruesome fun, and promise. Still, the jarring dissonance between Lambert's schlockier, ironic impulses and the more primal, elegant simplicity of King's horror, combined with a hefty helping of cheese, strand the film in the graveyard of ultimately inferior King adaptations. ""Sometimes dead is better,"" Jud Crandall extols ad nauseam - but Pet Sematary's cinematic unearthing leaves the epitaph of ""Sometimes book is better."" {but will you watch it anyway? You shouldn't. You know it's a terrible idea. You probably won't like it. But look, there you go, pressing play. Those Micmacs have their ghostly claws in you yet}6/10",Pet Sematary

76,one9eighty,The soil of a man's heart is stonier,7,24 July 2018,"Based on a Stephen King book, ""Pet Semetry"" is a horror film that looks at death, desire, reanimation, and why you should never build on top of an ancient Indian burial ground. A young 2.4 family move into the country, the new house they move into is right next to a big and dangerous road. They learn from their new neighbour that the road is deadly and has killed lots of local resident's pets over the years, and as such there is a local cemetery that was built by kids for their pets. While the family, minus the father, are away for a holiday tragedy strikes and the family cat is killed. The young father takes the cat to ""Pet Semetry"" and buries him, little does he know about the magic and witchcraft sown deep into this ancient Indian burial ground. The cat is reanimated, but is not like his former self, instead of being a loving cat; he's now feral and vicious. These are only the beginning of the problems though. Film's made out of Stephen King book's don't/didn't always make the grade on the silver screen, a lot of them never captured the tension of his writing and the movie adaptions ended up a little cheesy. This film however managed to do well, and doesn't detract massively from the book. I remember watching it as a youngster in the 90's and it was quite frightening. Watching it back closer to the age of 40 yo I can say that he film still manages to hold its own. The reason for this is because it's a solid story. Rather than get too deep into scientific reasons for events, or the history of the location, or even what form evil is taking in the film - it's handled from the point of view of the young father - we don't learn any more than he does, we just have to go with it. Nowadays there would likely be an entire additional hour looking at why reanimation affects different people differently, and why the evil is there in the first place. Granted, the book does delve into some of these things a little to build the tension, but in the film, there just isn't enough time to do so while maintaining the pace of events. So handling it the way it was generally works. The casting and acting is good, the young father is played by Dale Midkiff and is generally believable throughout. Denise Crosby plays he wife and does well, although I've never really been a fan for some reason (she has limited expressions and emotions - sorry). Fred Gwynne is the narrator and neighbour and drives the film forward, his performance is really good actually - sometimes hard on the ears to understand due to the random accent, but he's a rock in this film. The real winner is Miko Hughes as Gage Creed, the youngest child. He seems to be play sweet and creepy real well - I can see why he went on to have a decent career beyond this. Fair enough his lines are a little staged early on, but the switch in persona he manages later makes up for the cheesiness of the opening performance he brings. All in all this is a decent film, I can see why it's been rated highly amongst reviewers and I concur with them for the most part. For me this gets a 7 out of 10 - It's an all-around decent horror film, with a mix of emotions on display, despite being nearly 30 years old it manages to not look dated and out of place.",Pet Sematary
77,CharltonBoy,Fairly Scary,6,31 January 2002,"I found it really hard to come up with a mark out of 10 for Pat Sematary because there arent many bad things you can say about it yet there are many good things you can say. With Stephen Kings Screenplays there are either Brilliant (Green Mile,Misery) or they are apalling (Quicksilver highway,Sleepwalker). This is not in either bracket. I have read the book and it the film is fairly true to it. Pet Sematary is  scary and does keep you on the edge of the seat but it is also fairy predictable. The acting is ok and the special affects are alright too but nothing to get too excited about. One question that i have to ask of the story is, why did the couple buy the house so near to a busy road when they have two young kids? 6 out of 10.",Pet Sematary
78,Hollywood_Yoda,King at His Best!,10,13 May 2010,"Most likely one of the best adaptations of a Stephen King novel, if not the best of all! The film is creepy and gory beyond belief and a masterful suspense all the way through! Like Hitchcock's films of the past, Pet Sematary is among the elite in horror! No Stephen King film from this time forward has been ever as suspenseful. However, the sequel is a shameful attempt to be another Pet Sematary, but otherwise was a failure, and this film will be remembered for that. As Jud Crandall (Gwynne's character) says during the film, ""A man's heart is stonier, Louis"" and your heart must be stony to watch this film (possibly with the lights on!!), I give the film 10/10.",Pet Sematary
79,fernandoschiavi,"A regular adaptation, but still relevant, especially for the efficiency and power of its third act, which reveals little and creates an uncomfortable anguish",5,3 July 2021,"The horror that exists in Stephen King's literature, although vast in execution, has very recurrent elements. The vast majority involve children and this is not by chance. From a child's point of view, any shadow can become a monster. From an adult perspective, it's disturbing to see evil take over an innocent being. This nuisance, no matter where it comes from, is at the heart of everything there is more terrible about ""Pet Sematary."" King has had the best and worst of his production taken to the movies. There are successful cases, such as The Shining, Carrie and The Fog, but there are also misunderstandings, responsible for the possibility of creating a gigantic list of productions that can be called dramaturgical scribbles: exaggerated films, with poorly developed script and unbalanced direction. The Cursed Cemetery is not quite as uninteresting as the items on this list, but it is also far from memorable, such as the three films mentioned above.With a macabre plot about mourning and irreparable losses, the narrative takes care of the fantasy atmosphere and full of darkness to tell us the story of a group of people who plan a change in their lives, but things go beyond what was planned. The plot is not complex: The Creed family moves into a house in Ludlow, Maine. Among the first achievements in this new location is the friendship of the friendly Jud Crandall (Fred Gwynne). Responsible for talking about the place, the wise old man tells the mysteries surrounding a cemetery located on the outskirts of the residence, built so that children who had their pets, run over on the road that is close to the place, bury their animals.The script, built by Stephen King, sought to follow to the letter some of the writer's determinations, who, according to reports, was tired of seeing his works generate bad films in cinema. The literary material is the starting point that subsidized the film, but the series of changes made was intended to address the transposition of languages. Without being too purist with his own work, he cut important characters from the original text and cut out several elements that would have been out of place in the film. Completely meaningless, the screenplay seems to have been written for those who have read his book, sounding like a summary of his work. King also works against his own arguments, as he harshly criticized Stanley Kubrick for not being faithful to his book, in the classic 'The Shining' (1980), introducing characters and subtracting others from his book's original material.All done with the clear impression of not making the film too complex for its audience. One of the scariest characters in the film is Rachel's sister Zelda, who appears in a disturbing flashback. Suffering from spinal meningitis, a disease that makes her look like a fairytale witch, Zelda haunts Rachel into her adult life, and is responsible for some of the most memorable moments in Cursed Cemetery. Interestingly, Zelda was played by a man, Andrew Hubatsek, as the producers couldn't find an actress thin enough for the role.Seldom in horror cinema has death been portrayed with as much realism as in Pet Sematary. When talking about realism, I'm not referring, as is common when we discuss movies of the genre, to special effects or creative deaths, but about the effect that death has on people. Based on a book by Stephen King with a screenplay adapted by himself, and directed by Mary Lambert in 1989, Cemetery Damned is a film about death, mourning and burial. Its most disturbing side is not linked to the supernatural, but the horror of losing a loved one, horror that we will all have to go through someday, in a mixture of drama and horror that at the same time drive the film and create the main conflicts of the plot. Incorporating much of the original text, King always starts from a personal drama to build fear. This occurs from family neighbor Jud Crandall, from Rachel Creed's (Denise Crosby, ""Deep Impact"") past and, of course, from protagonist Louis Creed (Dale Midkiff, ""The Raven: Salvation"") with her son's death.It's quite remarkable how acidic the movie is. Because it was written by King himself, we can see several of his lines in the script. The strong dialogue about death, loss, even before Gage's accident and even after, is invaluable for the film. Like the book, it talks about how far we are willing to go to alleviate the pain of guilt. An example of a scene is the fight between Louis and his father-in-law at Gage's wake. When it comes to elements of cinematographic language, Pet Sematary does nothing more than trivial: Elliot Goldenthal's music is punctual and basic, the visual effects and scenography ""meet the requirements"" and Mary Lambert's direction transforms the script for Stephen King in a mid-range climatic thriller.One of the biggest problems that Pet Sematary suffers from is the spectator's lack of interest in the story. Our interest in the course of events is never renewed. The story feels like a succession of resurrections and flashbacks that never manage to interest us. Flashbacks, by the way, that manage to break any trace of the narrative line being misused during the plot and without any apparent need. The dead Victor Pascow disappears from the narrative all of a sudden, being absent for a long time, for when he ends up leaving the story again for no reason. King's text manages to stand out only when he touches on more delicate subjects such as the subject of death and loss and how we can get through this mainly by the questions of little Ellie Creed.Mary Lambert, the film's director, doesn't help us with immersion either. It is either because of your camera failure or the bad direction of some actors. It's hard to actually feel the growing tragedy that surrounds the Creeds, as the characters repeatedly and deliberately put themselves in situations that are sure to end badly. These flaws could be mitigated by strong performances by charismatic actors, but that, unfortunately, is not the case. Perhaps because of the lack of context that the original novel offers, the nature of the evil force that seizes Louis is never sufficiently clear, characterizing him as a frustrating character to follow, always inclined to (almost literally) dig his own grave and destroy everything around you for no apparent reason. Dale Midkiff is completely apathetic, not being able to form any reaction in some scenes. Only in the final moments does his performance improve a little. If Dale was too apathetic, the opposite happens to Denise Crosby who is too exaggerated, as in the scene where she talks about her traumatic childhood with her sick sister Zelda. Unlike them, Fred Gwynne is much like old Jud Crandall (though he's also overly dramatic, especially in the scene where he's talking to Louis in the kitchen, right after little Gage's death). Blaze Berdahl and Miko Hughes, who are the children of the Creed family, appear very well.Getting into all the trash atmosphere present in the decade, 'Pet Sematary' is a film that does not take itself seriously at any time. Will be present here several elements of classic films of the time, such as unreasonable gore, poor acting, bad script and a limited direction. And it is exactly these bad elements of the film that make it succeed in its onslaught. The film's pacing is extremely confusing, sometimes sounding like a botched summary of a more complex story. The building of characters is simply not done. We don't know why they act the way they do. Everything happens very quickly, not giving the viewer a chance to absorb certain content from the previous scenes.The film clearly has good ingredients and an interesting synopsis and had everything to definitely become a huge horror classic, but technically lacks art direction and photography that do nothing to help build suspense and a more macabre and terrifying atmosphere. Most of the scenes take place during the day and Mary Lambert is wrong to create suspense in a single scene. Editing and soundtrack are there to fulfill a function, which in the end deliver what they propose. The night scenes in the cemetery are harrowing and the final attack is beautifully executed. However, in moments of greater drama, the work loses a little of its shine, both because of the rush and the superficiality of the text.Looking at ""Pet Sematary"" after a few decades is still relevant, especially for the efficiency and power of its third act, which reveals little and creates an uncomfortable anguish. The lenses seem to know as little of what's going on as the characters themselves. This feeling potentiates the terror of what is to come, even though some script resolutions sound forced - once again, the rush of editing undermines the result here. It's still a film with good practical effects, an interesting text and one that reveals the consequences of not knowing how to deal with loss. In this sense, the work remains interesting and, if the less agile pace of some sequences is revealed, it remains an excellent example of the now nostalgic horror of the late 80's, showing itself as an average adaptation of one of Stephen King's most terrible novels. Another film that had the basis of its story in the minimacs, the Native American Indian cemeteries, is The Shining. The production managed to build a climate much more prone to terror, but that's asking too much of Mary Lambert, after all, Stanley Kubrick is Stanley Kubrick, isn't it?",Pet Sematary
80,aesgaard41,Almost One Of Stephen King's Best,6,9 March 2001,"PLOT SPOILERS AHEAD:Among my favorite horror movies, half of them belong to Stephen King, but Pet Sematary has got to be one of the most illogical. It's not the paranormal aspect that bothers me, but the likelihood that old Jud Crandall would show Louis Creed the old Indian burial ground if it had gone rotten. He even says, ""I'm being punished for showing it to you."" or something to that affect. A far cry from his days on the ""Munsters,"" Fred Gwynne and Dale Midkiff ( I loved him on Time Trax) both turn in great performances. Midkiff has a great role as a father who loses his son, but the plot loses all coherence with all these things being buried and coming back.

81,cchase,"Sometimes, ""READ"" Is Better...",7,5 December 2008,"Making a book into a movie by following the story page-by-page is NEVER a good idea. When people read the book, they automatically start making their own ""mental movie"" of who the characters look like, the places they exist in, how the situations progress. And everybody's mind's-eye opus is different, which is why when the 'REAL' movie finally comes out, you're always going to have a ticked-off segment of the movie-going audience who are disappointed that it just doesn't measure up.All a screenwriter and a director can hope to accomplish is whatever their own vision of the movie is, and hope that it comes as close as possible to what their audience is expecting to see.There is no better case for this situation than the movies based on the novels of Stephen King. When filmmakers capture at least the essence of his stories, the results can be breathtaking and truly terrifying (CARRIE, 'SALEM'S LOT, THE DEAD ZONE), or they can be what fans consider to be a gawd-awful mess (Kubrick's version of THE SHINING; the miniseries for IT and THE TOMMYKNOCKERS). Although it's not even close to being the perfect King adaptation, PET SEMATARY has so many moments of just skin-and-bone-deep unease that seemed to have bled onto the screen directly from the book, that you can pretty much forgive its shortcomings. For that, we have music video-turned-film director Mary Lambert to thank, (she also directed SIESTA, not exactly a horror movie, but another freaky-as-hell must-see you should put on your list), working from a screenplay by the 'Man-ster' Himself, and probably one of his better ones.Since the majority of you know the story, I won't put you to sleep with too many of the details. Dr. Louis Creed (Dale Midkiff) has moved his family out to the perfect house in the country. Well, almost perfect, except for two nasty little details: the dangerously busy stretch of interstate highway out in front, and the large pet cemetery in the woods out back. Since Louis is a veterinarian and has a young toddler for a son...well, even if you haven't read the book, do the frickin' math. It IS a King story, after all, so no mystery where this is headed. It's not so much the destination that counts here, but the spooky stops along the way. Certain scenes that are so familiar from the book are brought to shivery, scream-inducing life here: Rachel Creed's (STAR TREK'S Denise Crosby) horrific memory of her terminally ill, crippled sister; Louis's encounters with the mortally injured jogger Victor Pascow (Brad Greenquist), both before and after his death; the trip into the ""other"" cemetery beyond the pet cemetery. And that third act...if it doesn't give you a few nightmares, maybe you should check your pulse.Good performances by all here, especially the late Fred Gwynne as the well-intentioned neighbor, Jud Crandall, who gets the best line in the story that sums it all up: ""Sometimes, dead is better.""About the only problem with the movie version is the casting of Louis's son, Gage (Miko Hughes). Knowing that it would be damn near impossible to get the kind of performance needed from a kid that age to seal the deal on this, Lambert and crew still did the best they could, and unfortunately, Hughes at the time was just too damn CUTE to ""sell"" his intended role as an evil, demon-possessed zombie. This takes you out of the movie whenever he shows up, though the scenes where he's featured are still masterfully staged, (especially Gwynne's death scene.)Other than that, everything else is still about as good as it gets. CARRIE still holds the title for best King adaptation as far as I'm concerned; but SEMATARY is right up there in the Top Five.Still, will anything adapted for the screen based on a King book be as terrifying as reading the story? Not BLOODY likely...for now.",Pet Sematary

Many anecdotes, supporting characters, and scenes have been chopped off. The overall tone is less tense and the dramatic elements seriously down played. While that pretty much comes standard with most book-to-screen adaptations, it is always annoying when the book is so freakin' good!But overall this is a decent adaptation that still keeps certain strengths of its source. 6/10Rated R: violence/gore",Pet Sematary

When his 5 year-old son is killed under similar circumstances, the doctor does the same for him, but the boy turns nasty.Adapted from one of Stephen King's novels, this surprisingly laughable and over the top horror film did well at the box-office and became a cult success, but is dreadfully made.

85,jessegehrig,bleh,4,23 July 2013,"Perfect example of doing a Steven King story wrong. Have you read the book? It's schlock pulp horror, but great pulp horror, y'know, that's it's strength. The book delivers a good scare, mixing family horror with the sordid sour history of the land behind the Creed's home, y'know, there are metaphors and images that linger with the reader, great horror stuff, but the movie doesn't capture it. This mishandling of the story comes down to the film-makers being lazy and obvious. They were asking themselves "" How do we make this a horror movie?"" when they should have been asking themselves "" How would the Cohen bros do this movie, how would Kubrick do it how would Friedkin do it?"" This movie can be re-done and done very well: make it simple, do it strait forward, don't shoot jump scenes don't try to surprise the viewer, just show the story, let the viewer see what happens and let them decide for themselves if it's scary, don't focus on the scare focus solely on the story.",Pet Sematary
86,DarthVoorhees,Some really frightening ideas are trapped and gasping for air in a typical 80's scare flick,7,24 May 2013,"'Pet Sematary' is a brilliant story with rich and profoundly frightening mythology. Stephen King who for some is more about quantity over quality knocked it out of the park with this one in my opinion. My praise goes to the original story though and in some ways I cannot transfer it over to the film. It is just too much of an 80's scare flick with foolish special effects, bad acting, and clichés. What deserves utmost praise here is King's work, Mary Lambert and crew's execution in bringing it to the big screen is sort of muffled and unfortunately predictable. In my humble opinion 'Pet Sematary' is King's horror masterpiece. The horror genre is at it's best an exploration and exorcism of our fears and demons. There is no greater fear or demon than what lies beyond death. 'Pet Sematary' has taken that very fundamental human fear and tells a story of grief and death being perverted and twisted. It is a story much like the original 'Frankenstein' but it's supernatural overtones and the lead being a loving father with his young family make 'Pet Sematary' all the more tragic, poetic, and horrifying. The image of the grieving father holding the corpse of his son before he plans to reanimate it is utterly spectacular, the stuff real human nightmares are made of.The film's shortcomings come from just poor directing and acting from our lead. Mary Lambert unfortunately only saw a chance to make a scary movie in King's deep novel. She has taken this masterwork and really sought to only make a 'Friday the 13th' esqe thriller with it. We get very silly gory jump scares and extravagant make-ups that are used for nothing more than cheap shock value. 'Pet Sematary' does not need cheap shock value in the least. Despite this I think the film could have still been close to excellent despite Lambert's stale staging had a better lead been chosen to anchor the film than Dale Midkiff. Midkiff is just simply a bad actor who is given a rich role and can't really deliver on it. I'm surprised a lot of the film works despite his shortcomings because the role is so integral to the success of the story. When the film works it is because King's work is so strong. I forgive a lot of this though because King's screenplay is strong and because I must admit I have a sense of deep nostalgia about the film. I've loved horror films for years but not for their ability to 'scare' one. As a child 'Pet Sematary' scared the living hell out of me. I now recognize as an adult that it was King's mythology and story rather than Lambert's film that scared me but the film has a certain charm still despite it's temptations to follow the formula of Freddy Kruegerness. I mean who can't help but be drawn in when old Fred Gwynne warns us that ""sometimes dead is better?""",Pet Sematary

Well, Cemitério Maldito can't scare and much less has a story consistent, but well rewarded for the excellent makeup, the script has inconsistencies and sometimes makes the characters' attitudes stupid at an incomprehensible level. The performances are good but not very prominent, the death scenes are good and the makeup is of high quality as standard in the horror films of the 80s. Because it is inspired by a Stephen King work, at least one plot is always expected well developed, but that's not what happens here, as the characters 'attitudes are strongly influenced by dramatic issues even though they don't have good results with such an attitude they simply insist on hammering their mistake and the moments they try to scare are with mere clippings of camera that doesn't scare anyone.Film seen on October 11, 2020.",Pet Sematary

Louis befriends a kind and good old man named Judd Crandall (Fred Gwynne) who gives them a tour of the area especially of the local pet cemetery that has a secret beyond the area, it's an old Indian burial ground that has magical powers to resurrect dead animals and living beings. One day, the cat gets killed by a truck but luckily Louis and Judd resurrect it but it comes back as it seems harmless but somehow changed and even one day a terrible family tragedy has happened as it unleashes something evil that will happen.An excellent and gruesome adaptation of Stephen King's classic novel, this supernatural horror thriller offers good scares, great acting, and shocks abound. Fred Gwynne whom you remember as Herman Munster delightfully plays the Judd character perfectly, it's a gripping tale of the supernatural including the themes of life/death you won't forget.

I was straight up laughing out loud at certain parts. It's so campy and cheesy. I did love the little boy! He was so cute! He did an amazing job for only being three at the time.The little girl was so annoying! I couldn't stand her whining! Why didn't they kill her off instead of the little boy? Ugh! Her voice was like nails on a chalkboard and I thought she was a boy when the movie started. What an ugly child. Seems to have turned out fairly attractive which is hard to believe.Fred Gwynne had a bad accent and his teeth were so bad and distracting. He was an annoying old coot and I don't understand why the Dad kept dealing with him. He was grating on my nerves.The wife was unattractive and weird. Why would she continue to have anything to do with her nasty father after the way he treated her husband. The special effects were terrible and it was so obvious the little kid was a doll at times. I don't know how they thought that would fool anyone.The sister was played by a man and it was so obvious. It looked like the Wayans brothers in White Chicks.It was so stupid when the Dad was digging up his son and said ""I'm going to bust you out son"" and I was like ok because that's what you'd say in a situation like that...a bad pun. Ridiculous!And we're expected to believe that the dad would be able to navigate taking his wife up that long climb to bury her when he couldn't navigate taking his son up there who weighed pry about 130 lbs less! I hope that scene with the cat where the dad picks it up and injects it was fake cause it looked so real and the special effects weren't great back then. I'd be curious to know how they did that. When the son came back why does he kill Jud first? That makes no sense. He should have just gone straight home like the wife. There was no reason for him to go to another house other than to make the movie drag on for a bit.That scene at the end where the husband makes out with his wife was disgusting! I don't even know how the actor got through that scene without throwing up. Gross!Overall this is ridiculous and I'd recommend it only if you want to have some laughs.",Pet Sematary
92,Beejerman,CHEER! - (8 stars out of 10),8,19 March 2019,"The stage curtains open ...With the release of the new version of ""Pet Sematary"" right around the corner, I thought I'd revisit the original 1989 film. One of the darker Stephen King adaptations, this movie still delivers the goods in one of my favorites of its time.When the Creed family move to a rural Maine town, they find themselves in uncomfortable territory. The highway they live on is a death trap for all small animals that may wander out on to the blacktop and anybody else unfortunate enough to get in the way of a speeding semi-truck. The neighbor across the street, Jud Crandall (played by Fred Gwynne), does his best to make the young family feel at home and even shows them around the place ... including a pet cemetery (which the sign was misspelled to read Pet Sematary) where all the local kids have buried their beloved pets that the highway had claimed over the years. When the Creed's cat, Church, is killed - Jud also clues Louis Creed in on another cemetery, with powers to bring back the dead buried within it. But when the Creeds lose their little boy to a horrific accident - Louis considers doing the unthinkable.Even by Stephen King's own admission, this is a very dark story. Yet, it is handled well with solid performances - especially by young Miko Hughes who played the part of Gage Creed. The overall tone and feel of the movie will keep you teetering on the edge - the cinematography was very well done and the pacing good.This is a recommend for me. I've seen it numerous times over the years and have enjoyed it just as much with each viewing. I will probably be a bit critical going into the remake next month. But then again, I was very happy with the new version of ""It"". Hopefully, the trend will continue with this one as well.",Pet Sematary
93,thejcowboy22,Shoveling the dead becomes troubling,4,9 December 2019,"Black Friday November 29th 2019 How ironic! Saugerties, New York was the scene for a tragic fatal accident on a country road. Let me explain. My nephew bought a second home in upstate New York to get away from the hustle and bustle of the city. Peace and tranquility was what he was after along with her Wife and their two petite prides and joys, the dogs, Stella and little curious Olivia. I don't know the details but on the Friday afternoon Olivia ran out and on to the country road and was struck by an on coming car. She died instantly and automatically this conjured up memories of a gruesome and disturbing film, Stephen King's Pet Semetary. This obscure tale takes place In Maine. Physician Louis Creed (Dale Midkiff) and his family move into a new home Surrounded by sprawling woods, the Creed's are settling into rural locale. One glitch is the fact they live in front of a truck filled thoroughfare. Huge tractor trailers barrel down their street at top speed. The Creed family consist's of Dr. Creed and his wife Rachel played by Denise Crosby. Their two children, the elder inquisitive daughter Ellie played by Blaze Berdahl and the younger brother Gage (Miko Hughes) who is a wandering toddler who is cute as a button. On Louis's Creed's first day as the local Doctor, A local jogger was struck by a motor vehicle. Louis is pressed into service. The victim, Victor Pascow (Brad Greenquist) is mortally injured and close to death. Moments before he Victor dies, Louis looks down on Victor. Strangely Victor calls Louis by name without ever meeting him before and warms him of the dangers of a pet cemetery. That night Louis in his dreams sees Victor who leads him to the pet cemetery. Victor warns Louis not to cross the barrier because the ground is sour. The next morning Louis wakes up believing he was dreaming when in reality his feet are muddy. Our story gets personal when the Creed's are away and their pet cat Church wanders onto the road and gets struck. Enter elderly overall clad Jud Crandall (Fred Gwynne) their next store neighbor, tells Louis to bury his cat in the Pet Cemetery. This way Louis's daughter will never grieve over the loss because the next day Church comes out of the cemetery alive, dirty and extremely nasty. Watching the imposing trucks racing in front of the Creed's household is only a preview of fatal accidents waiting to happen. Predictably our story goes from bad to worse as lives are taken and the cemetery and shoveling play an integral part of this morbid story. To quote Jud Crandall , ""Sometimes dead is better!"" As for my opinion about this slasher styled horror film, I think to much was shown and the writers didn't give the viewers enough credit to figure the story out for themselves. Cameo by author Stephen King presiding over a grave side funeral. Kudos to the makeup department as they show a deteriorating ghost go from downright homely to grotesque. Over the top gore compared to other films on that subject notably George Romero zombie movies. Look both ways before crossing the street and proceed and watch Pet Sematary.",Pet Sematary
94,baileycrawly,Decent Film,5,6 June 2020,"Like so many others, Zelda was a figure of great terror in my childhood. I would picture the scenes in this film that featured the character and it would have me scared of my own shadow and, for that reason, this is perhaps the film I would rank to be the scariest horror film I've ever seen.
However, as with the book from which its sourced, it was always lacking in substance. There isn't a whole lot that happens in the book or the film - sure, what happens is horrifying, whether you're a parent or not, but that doesn't automatically make for a good film. Similarly to the novel, this film relies on a lot of dialogue-heavy moments to propel the plot, telling the audience about what happened instead of showing them the events in real time. It may, perhaps, be an impossibility to properly adapt this novel without taking some liberties and using dialogue to cover as much of the story as possible, but it gets extremely boring and tiresome after just a short span of time.
Overall, Pet Sematary is an absolute horror classic. It has cemented its place in horror history and will be remembered, watched and (hopefully) feared for as long as the world is turning but, in my personal opinion, it's in the lower tier of classics. A little too heavily reliant on the bloated book that takes up a lot of paper but doesn't accomplish a whole lot with its length. Pet Sematary could've been a novella and would've gotten the point across satisfactorily. Likewise, it's definitely better suited as a short film or hour-long special than a full-length work.",Pet Sematary

96,markovd111,"Again, the ruination of the source material...",6,20 August 2020,"At the beginning of my review, 2 quotes which perfectly summarize my view of this movie.

Second from a youtube comment on YouTube on ""Ramones - Pet Sematary"": ""The best part of the movie Pet Semetary is when this plays over the end credits.""
I don't know how long will it take for people to understand that making a quality movie based on the novel of Stephen King isn't possible (while doing the novel a justice, that is)... His novels are simply too full of little moments important for character development and cramming all that in to a less than a 2 hours long movie just isn't possible. Movie sure tries to follow the book, but is forced to cut so much out and change/remove important characters, that it soon becomes obvious it's too fast for it's own good. I'm not perfectly happy about the cast too. Kids do a pretty good job though, and so does Fred Gwynne and Brad Greenquist. But the main problem of the movie is that the whole point of the book (death and coping and understanding it) is replaced with fear of ""monsters"" and ""zombies"". In this way, probably the best King's book is turned in to a cheap Hollywood horror movie with too little soul and love put into it. 6/10! It isn't the worst thing, but it's far from great. Still, it's probably the best thing we will get on the matter, so, be happy with what you have, I guess.",Pet Sematary

But this moron has got to take the cake. Listen to my reasoning on this. First, the house. Only an incredible idiot would move into a house by an open highway in front without a fence or guard rail or anything like that. In my book Lou might as well thrown Gage in front of that Semi. Secondly he should have just let go, his son is gone and after the cat came back evil only a complete metal patient would do it again. I mean what the hell was he thinking? ""Well, the cat came back twisted and evil, but I'm sure it'll work this time."" Lastly, when the undead Gage kills his wife Rachel, you can guess what this bonehead does next. Now, let's talk about the title, SEMATARY? That's not how you spell it, I'm sorry Mister King, but you can't re-spell words to suit your story. It doesn't work that way. Plus, I have had the unfortunate luck to run into cats that has been run over by cars and trucks, normally they are flatter then pita bread, even once.

98,TheExpatriate700,Great King Adaption,8,8 August 2014,"Pet Sematary is arguably the best of the Stephen King adaptations. It captures the creepy atmosphere of King's novels with good direction supported by a largely competent cast. The film also embodies the feel of a Stephen King novel, with relatively few deviations from the book's plot and an adherence to King's use of dialogue. The film follows the travails of a family which moves to rural Maine, unwittingly locating near an Indian burial ground with the power to resurrect the dead. Things go very wrong.Pet Sematary's main strength is its use of atmosphere, which captures the eerie feel of a King novel. This atmosphere starts from the opening credits, which features an extended shot of the pet cemetery as children's voices read out the epitaphs of beloved dogs and cats. This atmosphere develops as the film goes on, with the sequences in the Maine woods particularly evocative. The darkness and shadows of the forest are used to unsettling effect, with kudos going to the cinematographer's lighting. However, the most disturbing scenes involve the mother's flashbacks to her sister suffering from spinal meningitis. The makeup on the actor portraying the sister is gruesome and deeply unsettling.The film also benefits from a good cast. Fred Gwynne is excellent in a supporting role as the neighbor who tells the family about the pet cemetery, while Denise Crosby does well in her role as the mother of the family. However, the casting of Dale Midkiff as the lead proves a weak point. He does not give a convincing performance, failing to really sell his character's terror and slowly building insanity. The flashback to the first time someone used the cemetery to resurrect a human also suffers from weak acting, descending into outright narmishness with the resurrected man stalking around like a child imitating a zombie.Nevertheless, as Stephen King himself has pointed out, his works are all too often ""packaged like lunch meat"" in their cinematic adaptations. Pet Sematary escapes that trend, still holding up twenty-five years after it was made.",Pet Sematary

However, the road has huge trucks that go about 90 MPH down it at random times. A lot of pets have been killed on the road, and were buried in the nearby ""Pet Sematary"". However, the Creed family seems to have non-stop bad luck which starts as soon as they move in. Firstly, Ellen is on a tire swing which breaks and she gets hurt. Then Gage runs into the street and almost gets hit by a truck. Then, on his first day of work, Louis gets a student who's head has been smashed open. Despite Louis' attempts to save him, he dies but returns as a ghost to help Louis later on. Soon after, Church is killed by a truck and this is when Jud teaches Louis about the burial ground beyond the Pet Sematary, where if you bury a dead pet there, it will return to life the next day. However Louis soon finds out that Church is not the cat he was before he died. Soon their Son Gage is killed, but he is returned as well, and not quite the same.

The characters are all real and fully developed, offering great dialogue and some incredibly chilling one-liners. The movie itself has a few terrifying moments, the most iconic scenes being the wife's memories of her sister Zelda. Lambert did a fantastic job of mixing up jump scares, tremendous gory make-up effects, and horrific moments the viewer anticipates.

Stephen King At His Best.",10,19 September 2014,"Pet Sematary is an excellent,scary and terrifying Horror film that combines fantastic direction,a great cast and a terrific score and theme song. All of those elements make Pet Sematary one of the best Horror films of the 1980s and one of the finest Stephen King adaptations.Based on Stephen King's novel of the same name,Pet Sematary tells the story of Louis Creed(Dale Midkiff)a doctor who along with his wife Rachel Creed(Denise Crosby)and their children Cage Creed(Miko Hughes)and Ellie Creed(Blaze and Beau Berdahl)have moved from Chicago to Maine with their house right across the street from their new neighbor Jud Crandell(Fred Gwynne). The Creed's new home is also located next to a Pet Sematary and Indian burial ground two places that will have disturbing,frightening and tragic consequences on Louis and his family.Pet Sematary is one of Stephen King's scariest,terrifying and powerful books so powerful that King himself felt he went too far with the writing and put the story away in his drawer but then took the book out and had it published and the novel became another bestseller for Stephen King which led to this film adaptation which was a success at the Box Office and is regarded as one of the best Stephen King adaptations. Pet Sematary is an outstanding and scary Horror film that right from the very start pulls into a nightmare and doesn't let go until the very end it's a movie that is very grim and downbeat with with a tragic and dark overtone with no sense of hope or optimism. What really makes the film Pet Semetary so powerful and great is that it deals with themes such as death,tragedy,loss of a love one,sadness and what happens between life and the afterlife and how a person deals with life and death. If you lost a person you loved you will relate to the themes in this film. The film and King's novel asks the question:if you lost a person whether it's a family member,friend or a lover what would you do to have that person back? The movie a asks and answers that question in a haunting and eerie way especially with the main characters Louis Creed and Jud Crandell who have discussions about life and death which add to the intense and chilling tone of the film because with Louis and Jud these two characters represent the audience and when we watch the movie we are going through what they are going when things start to go bad cause when the Horror starts it never stops and both characters are sympathetic and well-developed. The scares in Pet Sematary are truly frightening and very unsettling with scenes and imagery that is haunting,eerie and will disturb you to the core and stay with you after the movie is over. The violence and gore in Pet Sematary is vicious,mean and is not for the weak at heart with nothing being toned down for viewers because when the violence and gore comes you will cringe. Pet Sematary also works because of the atmosphere and tone throughout the film. The Maine locations in the movie add to atmosphere and make the movie cold and surreal with fog,smoke and harsh lighting that is murky and dreary to the point you are scared before anything really happens. If there is a flaw with the movie Pet Sematary is that while the film is a great adaptation of the novel the movie is not as good as the book. Stephen King's screenplay while good and faithful to the book it lacks the novel's power because with the screenplay it seemed like King was trying put some of the subplots that were in the novel in the film but the subplots while still good feel rushed in the movie and worked better in the book because after all it's really tough to adapt a 500 page novel with a 1 hour and 43 minute running time. At the same time a powerful film and story such as Pet Semetary seemed like it should been 15-20 minutes longer because while the main characters are interesting and fascinating and there is enough depth in the film I would have loved to have seen more because the movie Pet Semetary deserved to be longer. The ending in Pet Sematary in powerful,bleak,creepy and sad while staying true to the ending in King's novel while expanding the ending that will shock you while making you think. An amazing ending.The cast is wonderful. Dale Midkiff is terrific as Louis Creed with Midkiff bringing the right emotion and depth to the role. Fred Gwynne is brilliant as Jud Crandell,Louis next door neighbor and does a great job with the Maine accent. Denise Crosby is wonderful as Rachel Creed,Louis' wife with Crosby bringing dimension to the role. Miko Hughes is good and cute as Gage Creed,Louis and Rachel's son. Blaze and Beau Berdahl do fine jobs as Ellie Creed,Louis and Rachel's daughter. Brad Greenquist is great and scary as Victor Pascow,a ghost that's haunting the Creeds. Andrew Hubstek is memorable and creepy as Zelda,Rachel's sister. Also,lookout for a cameo by Stephen King himself as a Reverend.The direction by Mary Lambert is fantastic and stylish with Lambert always moving the camera with overhead shots,close-ups with low and high angles giving the movie a great pace and atmosphere. Amazing direction,Lambert.The score by Eliot Goldenthal is sensational,creepy as well as sad,suspenseful,haunting and tragic and matches the tone of the movie perfectly. Terrific score,Goldenthal. There is also the great title song Pet Sematary by The Ramones as well as The Ramones classic Sheena Is A Punk Rocker.In final word,if you love Horror Films or Stephen King,I highly suggest you see Pet Sematary,an excellent,scary and frightening Horror Film that you will never forget and is Stephen King at his best. Highly Recommended. 10/10.",Pet Sematary
105,mnpollio,Cheap shoddy adaptation,2,24 July 2019,"Stephen King's novels have always been ripe for film adaptations and, as a fan of much of his work, I have often looked forward to those adaptations with some trepidation. For every 'Salem's Lot, The Dead Zone, Misery or The Green Mile there will be a low rent tawdry entry like Graveyard Shift or Maximum Overdrive.The plot revolves around young doctor Louis Creed, who has accepted a cushy post at a local college and moves his family (wife, two children and cat) to small town Maine across the street from bucolic welcoming old neighbor Jud Crandall. The homey house faces a very busy highway where semis speed through at all hours of the day, while the back faces a dense forest wherein lies the Pet Sematary. A place where local children for generations have buried their pets, ergo the misspelled sign. When the family cat is killed on the road and Louis frets on breaking the news to the kids, Jud conveys a local secret that beyond the title place there exists an old Indian burial plot wherein the cat can be buried and resurrected. Unfortunately, the cat comes back markedly different and not in a good way, and that is only the first tragedy to befall the hapless Creed clan.Pet Sematary is one of King's better novels filled with sympathetic, well-drawn characters, a sense of foreboding and atmosphere of dread, and a good idea of how to disconcert the reader and put them through the ringer. The Creed family and Jud are all likable. Even when they do arguably stupid actions, King makes you understand why they did it and the emotional toll that compelled such action.Sadly this film adaptation is a mess. The film looks and feels cheap. The effects - from special effects to make-up to lighting - are phony and tacky looking. Director Mary Lambert - known mainly at this time for her efforts at music videos - has no idea how to develop atmosphere or character or suspense. The film snags some of the plot set pieces from the novel, but abandons any of the build-up or the character development that would make them have any emotional resonance. The whole effort feels rushed and you would be hard-pressed to remember it a week later.The production is just a debacle - victim of both a badly thought out screenplay and lackluster direction. Louis's nocturnal visits from a young collegiate that was hit by a car and died on his first day of work should be nightmarish, but every time the guy shows up in his bad make-up and spouting dreadful lines, one cannot help but giggle. Ditto, another character's unexpected suicide is so badly rendered that it resulted in guffaws from my theater audience.The characters that populate this landscape are barely sketches. With one notable exception, the acting is awful. Never once are any of them able to make you understand why they do what they do. Why does Jud convey the secret of the graveyard when he knows history has often repeated itself with tragedy? Why do Louis and Rachel stay in a house on a busy highway with their children? Why do they let the cat roam in such an environment? Who knows?Fred Gwynne manages to rise above the material as the neighborly Jud. He is personable and sympathetic and makes you wish he were in a much better film.Blaze Berdahl is not especially memorable as the Creed's daughter Ellie and Miko Hughes, while cute as a button, as the younger son Gage, just does not sell the film's latter portion at all. Then again, I am uncertain what young actor under this horrible direction could do it. What should be tragic and frightening somehow ends up being laughable.Denise Crosby is abysmal as the overly emotional wife Rachel, who may as well have victim tattooed on her forehead. The sequences featuring her memories of dealing with her spinal meningitis-afflicted sister are dreadfully rendered.Louis demands an actor with some heft, but instead we get the handsome, but psychotically bland and lifeless Dale Midkiff. Midkiff seems shell-shocked long before the film's woebegone climax. He is oddly introverted and ambivalent towards his wife and kids, so his actions later on do not ring true. He does get the film's best scene though, where the now demonic cat drops a disemboweled rodent on him while he is relaxing in the tub. It is one of the film's few honest and successful jolt moments that succeeds in spite of Lambert's clumsy staging. Sadly, Lambert works overtime to Austin Powers the scene within an inch of its life to avoid any nudity from Midkiff - which is a shame since I may have been inspired to raise the rating a star and given that his physical looks are the only worthwhile things about his performance here.By the film's conclusion, you will be neither scared, exhausted from the suspense nor moved by the plight of anything that happens on screen. The whole result is bereft of excitement or dread and just ends up as a tacky, cheap waste of time. Which is quite sad considering the promise implicit in the King source novel.",Pet Sematary
106,whatch-17931,"Doesn't take itself seriously, and not in a good way",5,17 January 2021,"The acting is pretty good, especially Fred Gwynne. The little boy as a zombie works pretty well too: ""not fair!""But stuff like the ghost guy sitting on the plane grinning is just bad cheesy. It just makes it seem like the production didn't take the material seriously and was winking at the audience. But they should have picked a lane and stuck with it.One relatively minor thing is the sweeping views of the Micmac cemetery make it quite clear that it couldn't possibly be remotely close to their house.",Pet Sematary
107,squirrel_burst,You could've avoided the whole thing by building a fence!,2,7 February 2015,"""Pet Sematary"" had a lot of potential, but despite what you might remember, it just doesn't live up to what it could have been. Based on the Stephen King book, it's about a family that moves into a new home. Louis (Dale Midkiff) is the new doctor at the university, Rachel (Denise Crosby) is his wife. Across the street is a friendly old man named Jud (Fred Gwynne), who warns them about the road nearby. As he explains it, the road has taken many lives, mostly pets. When Louis comes face-to-face with tragedy, he learns of a mysterious place beyond the pet cemetery, an old Mic Mac burial ground that holds mysterious powers.The biggest problem is easy to pinpoint: Screenplay by Stephen King. Having read the novel, I can tell you that the man hasn't cut a thing from the tome so plot points are quickly introduced and poorly developed because there's a new one right around the corner. The multitude of ideas here really needed a significant amount of buildup and development to be effective and as is, they just aren't and sometimes come off as 100% nonsense. Take for example, the Mic Mac burial ground. It's not a spoiler that this burial ground is not going to lead to anything good. In fact, we learn from Jud that it has a reputation for being an evil place. Why then, does he tell Louis about it, knowing that he will travel there? There are hints that the place has a mind of its own and is able to influence events and people, but there is so little time dedicated to this idea that actually, you are more prone to believing that Jud is simply an evil old man looking to screw around with his neighbor. It's one of the most frightening ideas in this story and it takes a backseat to countless other plot points that don't really go anywhere.There's so much going on it will make you want to run in front of a semi truck. We have the Creed daughter experiencing psychic visions (it wouldn't be a bad Stephen King movie without those), a friendly ghost that tries to influence Louis, back story between Louis and Rachel's father, Rachel's tragic past and family drama time. Each of these plot points end up hindering the story because they take valuable moments away from what would have been character development. There is a character introduced at the beginning of the film. She has a couple of scenes, dies and turns out to be completely pointless in the end. It's easy to see why she was included: her death is meant to begin a string of events that make Louis' actions during the climax of the film understandable. That sounds like a good idea, but when you don't care about the characters, it's impossible for the film to be effective.I really wanted to give this movie a shot, but I found so many things that bothered me about it. For example, Louis is a doctor so his wife nicknames him ""Doc"". In fact she almost always calls him ""Doc"". It's like the woman doesn't even know the name of her family members when you hear her say ""Doc come get your son"" and other similar phrases. She and her husband do not feel like a couple at all, not only because she nags him all the time, but because it feels like they have never spent any time alone together.Ironically, the film is simultaneously too empty and too full. It is full of useless plot developments that an unbiased screenwriter, one that understands that books and movies are like apple pies and orange marmalade would have cut. Books and movies are very different and can't be written the same way. In a book, having something like hallucinations, visions or ordinary objects turn against their masters can work because you're already visualizing the story in your head. Your mind is doing a lot of the work and when you've been sitting in bed reading for 3 chapters straight, not only does it naturally suck you in because you've been with the characters a long time, but you've gotten to be in their heads and you can actually imagine what is being described to you in a way that works. Movies only usually last 90 to 120 minutes; they're leaner and show you everything without having easy access to characters' thoughts. Stephen King is simply not able to understand this, which is why his screenplays do not work. It also doesn't help that there's some pretty wooden acting throughout. Maybe that was intentional. Bad acting for flat characters? It's a match made in movie hell.I will give credit to the special effects and makeup in the film, which are quite good. Also, for better or worse, Fred Gwynne gives a memorable performance. He comes off as a cooky old man more often than not, but there's something about him that grabs your attention. The rest of the film though, it's a really big disappointment. Compare this film to another one of King's novels turned into a movie, ""Christine"". Both have a pretty far-out premise, but ""Christine"", directed by John Carpenter works because the story is boiled down to its essentials. ""Pet Sematary"" is not; overall it's a big mess and you might remember it being scary and disturbing but that's only because you're remembering a few key scary scenes, which come at the very end of the movie and are actually better taken out of context.

Other than a fairly bland amount of tiresome moments, there's nothing much to hate on during this effective horror film.Author Stephen King abandons having a role only to do with the book, comes along and solidly writes the adaptation. There's no dragging or overlong introduction to the story presented in the film; what's occurring and who the leading protagonists are is clear within the first 20 minutes. It's quick!Also confined during the beginning of Pet Sematary, the main performances are reasonably poor. As you slowly sink heavily into the story, the acting luckily improves as you start to feel empathy for the characters' situation.The spine-tickling effects for a film released before the 90s are also definitely worth mentioning at least once, if not a few times. The depictions are deeply unsettling and are the final method to creating an above-average horror tale. 1989's Pet Sematary really takes advantage of owning a fascinating idea, but always relies on the cast, pace and execution.If you liked this review, check out the full review and other reviews at aussieboyreviews.",Pet Sematary
109,geminiredblue,Near Perfect King!!!,9,19 April 2011,"Growing up in a small Pennsylvanian town, Halloween was a bigger celebration than Christmas or even July 4th. Every where you looked, little stuffed ghosts and witches hung from front porches. Lit jack-o-lanterns grimaced back at you. And the Halloween parade brought out the whole town once a year. Local legends cropped up, ghosts and mysterious creatures lurked the nearby woods. Perhaps given that kind of background, it's inevitable that I'd become a fan of Stephen King. A man who shows what every kid knows: Beneath every quiet small rural town, lies a sinister secret. King's books work so well because they speak to our underlying fears. In PET SEMATARY, King does one better and shows us the destructive power of love and death. While some claim that it's based loosely on a short story known as THE MONKEY'S PAW, it stands on its own merits. Performances are terrific all-around. I was genuinely creeped out by the performance of zombified Gage, the kid. And Church, the demon cat? Well, in my opinion, that could be any cat- living or undead! Throughout the film, you get the feeling that all the characters are doomed. And by the film's end, it is very much a tragedy. Granted, some characters do stupid things. But the reason for that is because the story is done in the style of ""gothic horror"" where character inexplicably wander down dark corridors and whatnot. Genuine horror happens when the tragic meets the terrifying, and that's what this movie does best at showing.",Pet Sematary

116,kingofdanerds,A film that oozes creepy,7,25 October 2020,"Pet Sematary is the 1989 film that is based off of Stephen King's 1983 novel of the same name. As with most Stephen King movies that I watch, I have read Pet Sematary and is one of my favorite King novels. (Though ""The Stand is my number one). The first film adaptation was released in 1989 and recieved mixed reviews from critics but pretty much everyone I know (that has watched this film) has really enjoyed this film. Stephen King wrote the screenplay for this film which means that it will be reliable to the source material. The film was directed by Mary Lambert (famous for the Madonna music videos) and stars Dale Midkiff, Fred Gwynne, Denise Crosby and a young Miko Hughes.The film follows the Creed family who move into Ludlow (a fictional town in the state of Maine) from Chicago. The family consists of Louis (father), Rachel (mother), Ellie (daughter), Gage (son), and Winston Churchill (the cat). The live next to an elderly man named Jud Crandall who tells them about the Pet Sematary that is at the end of a path next to their house. The reason it exists is that the live next to a really (and I mean really) busy road that kills pets all the time and the Pet Sematary is a way for kids to bury their pets and learn about death. But the real horror is what lies beyond the Pet Sematary........Pet Sematary is far from being a perfect film but where the film does really good, it is really good. But when it goes bad, it goes bad. Pet Sematary is a film that just oozes creepy. It has the atmosphere that makes this film fairly dark and creepy which is what was in the novel and there is a big thanks to Stephen King who was really involved in this film. The story overall is great and one of the scariest stories that King has ever written. The film tackles subjects like death and grief fairly well here. It is a cautionary tale about letting the dead stay dead. So, when an unexpected death occurs, we see a grieving character (trying to remain spoiler free here) go against letting the dead stay dead and we see the consequences that follow. The story itself is a very unique one here. Plus, I am always a sucker for a good ghost story. The special effects here are really grotesque and add to the creep factor. Victor Pascow is truly amazing in terms of what was done with the special effects. It is gross, but I love it!!! Throw in great set pieces like the actual Pet Sematary and the burial ground which are truly fantastic and again add to this creepy tone. The film is far from being the scariest film out there but relies on telling a story rather than getting actual scares (and that is the focus of the 2019 Pet Sematary). There is one instance where there is supposed to be some sort of jumpscare but it ends up just being silly. Where the film fails is the acting which is pretty flat for the most part with the exception of Fred Gwynne who gives an amazing performance as Jud Crandall. He fits into this role as the since-birth-resident of Ludlow fairly well. Crandall is the man who knows everything that goes on in town and seems to be the only one who wants to talk about the things that most people tend to not talk about. Namely the Pet Sematary and it's secrets. The rest of the acting is flat. There is lots of foreshadowing in this film and it is really in the face at times and makes the unexpected death of a family member fairly predictable.Pet Sematary is a film that I like but definitely has flaws and the flaws are very apparent. The film itself is a treat to watcht though due to it's creepy atmosphere and unique story.",Pet Sematary
117,RhapsodyReviews,Not Good.,3,25 September 2019,"Review:
'Pet Sematary' is an American supernatural-horror film adaptation directed by Mary Lambert. It is based off Stephen King's 1983 novel of the same name. It has all the feel of a made-for-TV movie and, in fact, that's what it should have been. The film was terribly fast-paced and left out some of the more necessary plot elements of the book. They jumped into the darker element's way too quickly. There is barely a set up for the horror to come.
The movie follows the Creed family as they movie to a small farmhouse in the country. After their family cat, Church is hit by a truck their neighbor Judd Crandall (Fred Gwynne) show Louis Creed (Dale Midkiff) a place behind his house called the 'Pet Sematary'. After they bury Church in the Pet Sematary the cat is spotting by Louis in the house the next day. Needing answers Louis goes to Judd, who explain what the place is and why it's called that, while also warning him never to bury a person in the Pet Sematary. Time goes by and the while out playing in the yard the Creed's son Gage (Miko Hughes) is hit by the same type of truck as Church and dies. Not listening to Judd's warning, he takes Gage to the same place he took Church and buries him, not knowing the horrors that will wait him when Gage awakens.
This movie fell flat almost at the very start. The story is very intriguing, but the editing and acting are awful. I couldn't stay with the story because every time somebody spoke it was like they were reading from the script instead of embodying a character. The best acting in this movie is done when Gage becomes an evil child near the end of the movie, and that's saying something considering some of the actors in this movie are well known for the time.
Overall, this movie is going to have a short review because I really don't have a lot to say about this film. I know it's from the 80's, but that excuse can only get you so far. There are lots of good films from the 80's and 90's, this is definitely not one of them.

Maybe it's just because it's a bit old and stale. Not sure. The acting was bad. Very wooden and uninteresting except for the wonderful Gwynne who was delightfully hammy. The little girl and her mother were really weird - something really off about their acting that made them both irritating & unlikable. The father was bland as can be as well as completely stupid. The story itself was mostly boring - except Zelda, who was pretty neat. The few ""jump-scares"" you could see coming a mile off and there wasn't much to be genuinely scared about anyway. The gory bits were.... well.... gory enough I guess (I've seen worse and done better). The zombie kid and the friendly ghost were amusing. The cat was a pain in the a$$. I wished for more back-story on the burial ground and less about the boring self-involved family. A bit more about the town and how they'd dealt with the burial ground, more about Zelda - that sort of thing. And the Indian burial ground & semetary just weren't anywhere near spooky enough. So much more could have been done with that. Also I wish they'd done a lot more with Jud. Made Jud sinister instead of guilt-ridden & weak perhaps. There was one moment when he grinned in an evil way at the idiot father & I thought for a second he was going to be an interesting twist in the story, but alas it was not to be. I would have liked a story-line where he was somehow involved in the nastiness and survived triumphant at the end. Or where he saved the day. Or where he just did nothing but calmly watch it all unfold and then sat on his porch watching THEIR house burn saying ""heyup! Sometimes dead is better"" to no-one in particular and grinning maniacally. Oh well. I have my dreams.I liked that the kid was cute - made it more creepy. We just really didn't get enough of that creepy stuff. Too much time is spent on family dramas and their annoying possessed cat who does nothing interesting except hiss a lot & look grumpy. Rather like my cat. She also drops dead rats in my bed occasionally. She's not scary either, just annoying and disgusting. All in all I found it a bit of a snooze fest with the occasional giggle and one or at most, two moments where I had to peek through my fingers coz it was nasty. I honestly don't know whether to recommend it or not. I guess it's worth looking at but don't expect too much and view it as a bit of a send-up or parody rather than a serious horror movie and you might get enjoyment from it.",Pet Sematary

One thing I didn't like that much was the side story of the wife and her sister, it felt shoehorned in there and didn't really have much of a conclusion to it.

123,Chromium_5,"An awesome premise, but it's not developed enough",6,18 March 2005,"The underlying idea in ""Pet Sematary"" seems to be that when people are brought back from the dead, they have all their brains, but no souls. Definitely a cool idea, but for some reason it is never expanded, explained, or even mentioned. Theology aside, even the science of what's going on is unclear. How come Timmy, when raised from the dead, staggers around like your run-of-the-mill zombie, while little Gage actually seems smarter and suddenly knows how to operate a telephone? It's all very sloppily done. In fact, the only explanation at all for why the cemetery does what it does is that the ground is ""sour."" Sorry, but that doesn't really cut it for me. If the movie had focused more on the mystery of the cemetery, it would have been a fantastic thriller. Unfortunately, it ditches the interesting stuff, and instead turns into a ""Tales of the Crypt"" episode about a crazy toddler with a knife.Of course, there's still a lot to like about this movie. If it's main intention is to scare you, it certainly does it's job. The scene with Zelda is one of the scariest things I've ever seen, and the death of Gage is very upsetting and hard to watch. The mysterious Judd is arguably one of the coolest movie characters of all time (and to be honest, I was so upset when he died, I completely lost interest in the rest). And while at first it seems a bit odd for a zombie with half his head missing to be the comic relief, somehow it works. But even though it has its good parts, not nearly enough attention is given to the intriguing premise, and it ultimately turns into a cheesy spook story. Too bad, because it could have been a lot more.",Pet Sematary
124,el7,I don't wanna be buried in a pet sematary.,8,12 October 2012,"""What you buy is what you own, and what you own always comes home to you."" Jud Crandall (an excellent Fred Gwynne) says this to Louis Creed, and its an apt summation of what makes this film so scary. It's a faithful adaptation of Stephen King's novel of the same name, about an earnest doctor (Dale Midkiff as Creed) who moves his young family to a house right next to a two lane road frequented by 18 wheelers. His wife Rachel (Denise Crosby) has misgivings about the road, but the family meets friendly neighbor Jud and visits the charming pet cemetery on the other side of the property, and are won over. She should have been a lot more worried about that pet cemetery. As Jud starts spinning tales on his front porch, it comes out that it's right over the crest from an ancient burial ground with terrible powers. Dr. Creed starts falling down that slippery slope after his daughter's cat dies, and what results is a fascinating study in self-justifications from all of the adult characters. It's also spooky as hell. Just wait 'til you get a load of Zelda. The only spot that mars the perfect terror of this movie is (SPOILERS AHOY) that it's nearly impossible to be afraid of the kid. In places it's downright comical. Luckily the movie redeems itself with an awesome shocker of an ending.",Pet Sematary
125,AlabamaWorley1971,One of the better Stephen King adaptations,8,28 October 2000,"So often with Stephen King adaptations, you just get a collection of characters reciting dialogue from the books. This really captures the heart of the book. Maybe because they DON'T use large chunks of text straight from the book, but it's a bit more of an improv of the events in the story. A big part of its success is Miko Hughes as baby Gage. Dale Midkiff and Denise ""Tasha Yar"" Crosby really act like his parents. There's a scene where Louis is cuddling Gage, and they are very natural together. Fred Gwynne is WONDERFUL. He nails the Maine accent perfectly without lapsing into parody, and is wise and warm just like Jud should be. (8 out of 10)",Pet Sematary

128,Mara-Jade-Skywalker-23,A Descent Horror Film,6,6 July 2019,"Introduction:""Pet Semetary"" is a good Stephen King adaptation and an alright horror film. While not all the scares land, and some are in fact funny, many scares are terrifying.Pros:The film has a Stephen King feel to it. And the story is original and has it's horrifying moments. As we understand the main character's motivation to redirect his dead son. However, he comes back as a serial killer. And damn, the kid playing him is legitimately scary. Something about this kid killer really gives me the creeps.And the film has so many memorable scenes of gore, horror, and drama. And while I like most of the film is good, there are some flaws within this movie.Cons:The film does many pros, but also a lot of cons. Like the film's ending. After killing his undead son, he tries to redirect his wife, the same way he did his son. And it's so forced, yes he's in grief, but he saw what happened the first time, but why try again? And then it ends on a cliffhanger. And that's it. The ending just frustrates me.And also some of the scares aren't scary, and just come across as hilarious. Like some of the fake looking props and costumes, that just look funny.Conclusion:Even with the flaws, I think the film works. When it's scary, it's scary. And while not all the horror lands, most of it does. It's a good adaptation, it's an entertaining film. And worth watching.",Pet Sematary
129,Lando_Hass,"Truly mesmerizing, and scary at times...",10,4 October 2002,"I am a big fan of Stephen King's work, and this film has made me an even greater fan of King. Pet Sematary is about the Creed family. They have just moved into a new house, and they seem happy. But there is a pet cemetery behind their house. The Creed's new neighbor Jud (played by Fred Gwyne) explains the burial ground behind the pet cemetery. That burial ground is pure evil. Jud tells Louis Creed that when you bury a human being (or any kind of pet) up in the burial ground, they would come back to life. The only problem, is that when they come back, they are NOT the same person, they're evil. Soon after Jud explains everything about the Pet Sematary, everything starts to go to hell. I wont explain anymore because I don't want to give away some of the main parts in the film. The acting that Pet Sematary had was pretty good, but needed a little bit of work. The story was one of the main parts of this movie, mainly because it was so original and gripping. This film features lots of make-up effects that make the movie way more eerie, and frightening. One of the most basic reasons why this movie sent chills up my back, was in fact the make-up effects. There is one character in this film that is truly freaky. That character is ""Zelda."" This particular character pops up in the film about three times to be precise. Zelda is Rachel Creed's sister who passed away years before, but Rachel is still haunted by her. The first time Zelda appears in the movie isn't generally scary because she isn't talking or anything, but the second time is the worst, and to be honest, the second time scares the living **** out of me. There is absolutely nothing wrong with this movie, it is almost perfect. Pet Sematary delivers great scares, some pretty good acting, first rate plot, and mesmerizing make-up. This is truly one of most favorite horror films of all time. 10 out of 10.",Pet Sematary
130,M_Exchange,Reminds me of how much films have improved,2,7 April 2019,"As I'm writing this review, the 2019 version is ranked slightly lower than this film, which is unbelievable to me. The 2019 film has its own host of flaws, but it's much better than this thing.
The ridiculously excessive use of the Victor Pascow ghost, the completely unnecessary scenes with a cancer- stricken woman who kills herself, the amateurish cinematography (generally poor framing of shots), the dated special effects (which are fine in old films if they're done well-- i.e.: ""The Thing"") and, to me, the worst flaw, the god awful acting, combine to make this thing seem like a Lifetime channel Halloween special.Dale Midkiff is painfully bad in his role as Louis Creed. If your lead actor is horrible he/she is like a ton of lead on the whole production. In this case, the supporting cast could not pick up his slack-- far from it.Sometimes the dialogue would seem horrible even if Bryan Cranston himself were delivering it. There is a scene in which Fred Gwynne says the line ""sometimes dead is better"" three times during the course of one minute. It's a good line in one quick shot. After three, I need you to relax, buddy.The scene in which Gwynne's character gets killed by the demon child is one of the few fairly well-done moments in the film.But all in all, god, what a disaster.",Pet Sematary

There are such bone-chilling moments, especially at the movie's climax, that make this one of the best Stephen King adaptations of all time. The story is one of great loss, and what lengths one may go to quell the despair. It comes with a looming atmosphere of dread, and the story can be more relatable than one may like to admit. The acting is well done, and Fred Gwynne steals the show with his foreboding character and way of speech. Modern viewers may find some scenes tacky, or corny (I certainly don't), it may not stand the test of time as well as other horror classics, but it certainly doesn't lose its edge and creepiness factor, and remains to this day one of the staple horror milestones, one that truly captures the horror which emulates from the mind of Stephen King.The epitome of creepiness.",Pet Sematary
132,irishm,Unimpressive adaptation of a great book,4,14 June 2015,"I suppose they did what they could as far as bringing a long novel to the screen, but it was still a once-over-lightly effort compared to the depth the characters in the novel had. If they ever remake this, I'd like to see it as a miniseries so they could include more about the characters' motivations and backstories. It's my all-time favorite King book and I so wish they had done a better job conveying the wonderfulness of the book onto film. So much happened inside the characters' heads, though, that I'm sure it would be very difficult to get everything that really matters across to the audience.I like Fred Gwynne, but he's not at all the way I envisioned Judd I saw Judd in my mind's eye as a kinda shriveled-up old Maine-ah, not big enough to totally fill a doorway. The other actors were nothing to write home about, and the little girl was plain awful. Both the Pet Sematary and the Micmac burial ground were a lot more elaborate than I had envisioned, but I don't mind that much who says that what I envisioned is the ""right"" way it should look? Yet I do wish that Church had looked the way he did on the novel's cover, a regular ol' tabby cat (Maine Coon, perhaps?) instead of a Russian Blue. Beautiful cat, but not the ""Church"" of the book.I re-watched it recently to remind myself of exactly what I hadn't liked about it, and I have to say that the end was a real let-down. The little boy should have looked a whole lot more damaged and that would have added to the terror. The book mentioned that his head was misshapen well, no surprise there; he got hit by an 18-wheeler hard enough to knock him out of his shoes, but aside from being light blue and having one little faint scar on his forehead, he looked fine at the end of the film. I'm sure putting hours of special-effects makeup on a squirming 2- year-old is impossible, so I get the ""why"" here, but it still took a lot away from the ending to have a cute light-blue kid toddling around supposedly terrifying everyone. Maybe CGI the dead Gage in a future re- make?Credit where it's due: one of the most subtly horrifying scenes in the book made it to the movie version and it was very effective. At Gage's funeral when Louis is fistfighting with Rachel's father and the coffin falls off the bier and hits the floor, bouncing open for just one nanosecond, giving just a momentary peek at Gage's little hand wow. Well-done on that shot, Madame Director. It was just enough, not too much, not too little.Otherwise, a run-of-the-mill adaptation of an outstanding horror novel.",Pet Sematary
133,fdbjr,Idiocy,2,21 March 2007,"*Contains Spoilers* I read and enjoyed the novel on which this movie is based, but the movie itself had so many you-gotta-be-kidding-me moments in the beginning that it lost all credibility. In fact, the opening scenes have become one of my shticks about bad scripts.Family moves into new house. They are not poor - husband is a doctor, and his being a physician is essential to the plot. They have a small boy. For some reason known only to the scriptwriter, they choose a house by a hill with a two lane road where these gigantic trucks come whizzing down the slope all the time!!! And the front yard isn't even fenced!!! The movie opens with the audience thinking the child has been squashed by one such truck, but it turns out good ol' Fred Gwynne has saved him.ARE YOU KIDDING ME? No family with young children in its right mind would live in such a residence. Wives divorce husbands over that kind of home choice. Even if they couldn't find the 'right' house, they'd rent somewhere where it's safe. Yet Mom and Dad - affluent young yuppies - seem to accept those trucks as just one of those things.

Mr. King's best film adaptation - hands down, and one hell of a creepy movie. I have always loved King's books, but somehow his films fall flat, or at least they start out good and then have an alien turtle at the end. Not the case here, Louis Creed and his family move to a small New England town on one of the deadliest trucking routes around (thing's tend to go splat - a lot)and Louis learns about a place that has the power to bring (dead) things back to life. The acting is outstanding: Dale Midkiff as Louis Creed and Fred (Munster) Gwynne as Jud Crandall are so believable that you forget you're watching a movie, and every good horror flick needs a creepy kid - we got that covered too. Mary Lambert directs and I find it hard to believe that all her other films completely blow, but they do...

137,Manthorpe,Sometimes they come back.,6,15 November 2004,"Herman Munster spills the beans on an ancient Indian burial ground and opens up the gates for dead and rotting loved ones to come back from the dead. This is a fairly simple film, so I'll keep the review that way. Like most cheap horror films, many of the important aspects to make a good film are overlooked and rushed to get to the money shots as soon as possible. This is all too apparent here in Pet Semetary. While it does have some decent spooks and scares, the bad acting and complete implausibility of certain actions and situations take away from the good parts. However, some of the good scares are decent enough to give the film a reputation, particularly the sick woman scene. Everyone has at least heard of the disgusting woman in PS, which says something; the scares here can be pretty decent. I particularly enjoyed watching a young Miko Hughes. He's a very good actor for being so young. Too bad a toddler can act better than the rest of the cast, otherwise we might have something really good here. It's not that the film is bad, it's just average. While it won't change your life or how you view movies, PS will provide at some good entertainment for a short period in your life...and possibly a few laughs.",Pet Sematary
138,alexcomputerkid,One of Stephen Kings best film adaptions.,8,3 April 2015,"I would never say any Stephen King book is confusing. He has an easy style that's easy to read. It is true that The Stand from 1978 and Under the Dome from 2009 are both thousand pages novels and have a lot depth but with these books you have know to know what you are getting yourself into. Along with Cujo, Pet Sematary is King's simplest novel with both an easy plot and it is one of my favorite books of all times. The plot involves a family moving into rural Maine with the property right beyond an Indian burial ground with a pet cemetery and the family does not know that the both are going to tear the family apart.Following the same plot to the movie, I've always loved the Pet Sematary from 1989. This is the type of horror to introduce people into the genre and other King's adaptations. Pet Sematary is filled with so many interesting scenarios that they are worth noting.A) It is directed by Mary Lambert who's career highlight is sadly only this but she was a female director doing horror which is not a common thing.B) With a cast of Dale Midkiff as Louis Creed and Denise Crosby as Rachel Creed, this is a film that led by lesser names. The biggest name you are going to find here would have to be Fred Gwynne known for The Munsters. Still, the quality of the acting is nowhere close to being an issue here anyway you look at it.C) This is filled with some of the most bizarre and creepiest scene of child killing of child actor Miko Hughes. Hughes is a child actor who's legacy is those scenes and for his role in Kindergarten Cop.D) Let's also not forgot the plot element involving the dead sister of Zelda which adds to the creepiness level and it tackles the concept of death quite nicely. And yes, Zelda is played by Andrew Hubatsek, a male actor which is really is something else and maybe not surprising.E) It's quite forgotten the eerie atmosphere this film provides. One part is a lake in the back of the family's house and there is also a house that's very dated but has a nice late 80's touch. The house is off a main road where trucks are known to speed which is the site where killing happens to animals and people too. Last but not least is the ""pet sematary"" and Indian burial ground which involve some pretty original sets. With the song Pet Sematary by The Ramones rolling once the credits hit, I would really go as far as to say that Pet Sematary is one of the most important horror film around. It has one central idea and also puts a lot more into the subplots. This is impressive horror indeed and one of Stephen Kings best film adaptions.",Pet Sematary
139,azeemnavarro,People don't know what's good...,3,14 August 2019,"In recent years, and even more after the remake was announced, everyone in the internet was like ""oh yeah i love the old Pet Sematary"". Now, when I watched this movie years ago, I though it was mediocre, nothing special. But then I read the book, and oh boy, I could not disagree more about the quality of this movie.
Watching it with new eyes, I can say this is a very poor attemp to adapt the novel by Stephen King, yeah I know SK itself wrote the script, so I just can't tell what went wrong there.
The novel is a great tale of how people deal with grief and fear of death... this film is just another cheesy, low budget, '80s trash ""horror"" that results in involuntary comedy. The only aspect they got (unfortunately) right is that every character (except Jud) is an unlikable stupid a**hole. That's one of the weaker points of the novel, but here is just unbearable. The fact that the best performance is from Herman Munster may tell you that the acting here is atrocious. Dale Midkiff and the two twins that play the daughter have to be two of the worst performances I have seen in an horror film. I can't blame Miko Hughes bad acting because he was like 2 years old, but you really couldn't find someone better? The kill scenes are ridiculous because you're seeing a charming baby (or a bad muppet) murdering people that with a one punch can destroy that boy (yeah in the book is unrealistic too).
The filmmaking is competent in some instances (like the scenes in the cemetary), but there are a lot of terrible shots here and there that make me mad, and overall is just extremely boring to watch this in it's entirety.
I can say very few redeemable points, like I said Fred Gwynne is quite good, the cemetery scenes, the make up... but that's not enough, you know?
I can't undestand why casual people love this movie (because everyone that has some knowledge pan this movie to death), so you may like this is you watch very few movies, but I would tell you should abstain from watching this. While the book is flawed too, is totally worth it.
At the end, this is a typical SK adaptation, with all the 'bad' that conveys.",Pet Sematary
140,tbyrne4,Genuinely scary horror film,8,31 March 2006,"Excellent film adaptation of Stephen King's novel. The happy and loving Creed family (husband, wife, daughter, and baby boy) move into a house next to an interstate in rural Maine. Their only neighbor is a kindly old man named Judd (beautifully played by Fred Gwyne), who takes the family hiking one day to visit the Pet Semetary, where people from the area have been burying their pets for ages. When the Creed's cat, named ""Church"" dies after wandering onto the interstate Judd tells father Louis Creed about a cemetery beyond the Pet Semetary where things can be buried and brought back to life. Trouble is, they aren't quite the same.Things pretty much go downhill from there. Little tragedies start befalling the Creeds. Things turn black and blacker. And then blacker still.I remember reading the book Pet Semetary. It is effin SCARY. I've read many books by Stephen King but none of them are quite as dark as Pet Semetary. The final line of this book literally paralyzed me with dread. I know Stephen King has a young son and that may be why he went even deeper into darkness with Pet Semetary. Perhaps.The movie is quite good. It goes off the rails a little at the end when it chooses to become less subtle. I think it would have been more effective to play it dark the whole way through. Something about this movie always disturbs me. Horror movies don't scare me, really. But Pet Semetary disturbs me. All the situations are about the horror of bad things happening to people you love. And THAT is disturbing. And feelings of rage and guilt within families. The Zelda character, the way Gage dies. All that stuff is played for impact as emotional horror rather than spooky ghost-story horror.One scene for some reason that I've always really found disturbing is the flashback with the soldier who dies in WWII whose his father brings him back to life. And the son/soldier comes back as a tormented zombie who's more animal than human. I found that very disturbing somehow.Excellent film. Really good adaption.

Pet Sematary told us a story of secret burial ground hidden in the backyard of a newly moved young family of Dr.Louis Creed, that soon become a forbidden fruit when he knows that a buried body can be resurrected there.This film actually quite lovable to me. It has many potentials, like the fact that Stephen King wrote the screenplay, good acting, quite nice pace, and recurring (philosophical) talks about that quite inspiring to me. However, I just realized that the synopsis has retold half of story. It's not that I against that kind of move (hell, many Indonesian movies are like these, four paragraphs full of story until unconvincing question that too stale to be asked). Same goes to this film, while I appreciate many things given in this film, it becomes too depended to the film climax. How is the resolution when the doctor bury his son in the burial ground? What will happen? How is other family members react to that?Those question are quite challenging to be answered, and I do hope King has his own way to make a nice ending, but somehow all geniuses turn new low when the climax ... is laughable at best. I know that the idea of the resurrected ones will be murderous, inhuman, and so on, but asking that all people around them suddenly weak and move like elders are just pure stupid for me. Well, probably we have to consider that they are in big shock after sudden death of their loved ones. But still, it's just an alienation of the previous scenes that build for the ending.While I am trying to accept many things from this film, I guess some of the decision made by the characters are also questionable. My foremost question is, why a doctor, knowing that they have dangerous road ahead of their house, decide to let his baby kid playing around with a kit and tells the baby to run? I don't know because I am not a father, but keeping your kid from exploring themselves outside are way more logical than letting your kid play around near dangerous road. Well, the characters know that the burial ground is evil and want anyone to try on it, so why not going full supernatural like sudden death or something? I'm sorry I'm ranting.I am not quite following this film considered Stephen King's peak moments in his filmography. I enjoyed the suspense though, and I really do. However, many questions should asked and answered well in this movie and decided to make something more questionable in the name of a person's mourn. Well, I guess I have to learn to empathize that emotion, but knowing many films deal with these kind of thing and still able to do just fine, makes me worried that Dr. Louis is just a poor soul that leaves too many reasoning ability from his med school.",Pet Sematary

I had seen bits and pieces of the movie before, but I never really became engaged in it, possibly because of it's supposedly obvious plot. However, the pieces of the story that freaked out a number of my friends were nothing they could have guessed. Case in point: Zelda, Gage, and Pascow. Wow. This freaked them out entirely, to the point of one of my friends admitting that Zelda screwed up his childhood dreams for many years when he was taken to the film as a child.The music was not your typical brooding, synthesizer-pad, horror movie score all the way either, with The Ramones writing a punk rock song for the film and having another of their hits jamming in the truck-driver's cab. The cat they got to play as ""Church"" (the family cat) was an amazing animal-actor (I guess you could say), and the effect they used on the eyes was really cool.The plot is almost half-given away by the cover art and title, so I'm trying to leave out as much as possible, but it seems that the story was more about past guilt and trying to make amends with your guilty conscience by bringing things back, to save them and your guilt. It's an excellent thought, but as Fred Gwynne puts it, ""Sometimes dead is better.""Go rent it the next time you feel like a horror movie and see a nice twist on the zombie/ghost genre.

It's beyond cheesy and it's not trying to be that on purpose!The lead actor is hands down one of the all time worst actors I've seen in any movie! It's telling that he hasn't had much of a career besides random TV appearances since this. He has no emotion when he should and all of his line reads are the driest of dry. Fred Gwynne best known from the classic Munsters is nearly unintelligible with every line he speaks. He has an accent, but sounds like he's chewing on marbles while he speaks. There were lines we couldn't understand, rewound, and still couldn't understand! We gave up after a while and just inferred what he said. The wife was also not good at all, especially when she was reliving the story about her sick sister, some grade F acting all around.Besides the atrocious acting this thing just isn't well made from all filmmaking aspects. It feels like a made for TV movie with it's production quality. Really awkward editing and pacing. The set up for the characters takes sooo damn long to get done.All around this just isn't a good movie. It's sure not scary at all and only is labelled as a horror movie because of it's horror themes, not because of any fear it causes.

148,FluffyPantsReviews,This movie deserves more people talking about it...,9,18 July 2019,Pet Sematary 1989 is/should be considered a classic horror movie. One thing great about this movie is that the horror is just not jump scares but the horror is more of ideals. The horror of a evil place drawing someone to bring love ones to corrupt into something else entirely. All the actors in the movie are great even though the daughter can over do it sometimes. My favorite character is probably Jude. The way that the burial ground compels Jude to introduce Louis and then Louis is consumed by it is so scary. And I love how the movie never actually shows you the evil of the burial ground. The best thing about the movie is the atmosphere and the set design with the creepy Forrest. Gage getting hit by that truck is heart breaking but it is just so creepy seeing Louis dig his son up and then burying him the the burial ground. The final confrontation where Louis has to put his evil son down is so good. And that ending where Louis buries his wife and the end part is so scary and creepy. An underappreciated horror master piece.,Pet Sematary

There pet cat soon dies after being run over by a passing truck. Hes soon buried in an ancient burial ground behind the semetary, after that the horror begins to stir. The actors are pretty good and play interesting characters, the plot is scary and the tension and climax grows more tense, there's a few jumpy scenes and a few gory scenes.

158,Psycho Mantis,Scary as hell,7,1 July 2001,"The Creed family move out to the forests of Maine, to a nice house in an idyllic setting. The only problem seem to be a dangerous highway nearby the house, on which heavy trucks are driving all day long. The family dad, Louis, soon become friends with their new neighbor and he shows Louis a mysterious pet cemetery. The legend says that if you bury something or someone there, he/she/it will come back alive. But not the same as before. When the family´s cat is killed by a truck, Louis decides to try the cemetery, and buries the dead cat there. Big mistake. And this is only the beginning.Based on the book by Stephen King, ""Pet Sematary"" still stands out as one of the spookiest films ever made, in my opinion. It scared the shit out of me a couple of years ago, and now when I´m a big boy, I still found myself covering my eyes several times. Some flashback scenes involving a sick girl are very unpleasant, to say at least.Dale Midkiff is believable as Louis, the man who gradually learns how powerful the ground of the pet cemetery is. But Fred Gwynne is even better, in a terrific performance in one of his last roles, as the neighbor Jud. He is actually one of the most interesting characters Stephen King has ever created. Look out for Mr. King himself, in a brief scene as a priest.
The environments are imaginative, the score is impressive and there are lots of scary moments and jumps, as stated above. Even though ""Pet Sematary"" is one of the best of King´s adaptations, the book is still better. It develops the characters and events better, which books often do. But if you can handle all the gore and creepiness, this is a rather good horror movie, with an interesting story.One more thing. The film´s theme song, by the incredible band The Ramones, has got to be the best one ever written. The lines in the chorus, ""I don´t want to be buried in a pet sematary, I don´t want to live my life again"", are absolutely fantastic.* * * ½ out of * * * * *",Pet Sematary
159,rolandddd,Better than average Stephen King adaptation,7,1 July 2013,"Pet Sematary is a late-eighties adaptation of Stephen King's horror novel, and King himself wrote the screenplay for the film. The film follows the Creed family, recently moved from Chicago to a small town called Ludlow, Maine. The main plot concerns an ancient Micmac Indian burial ground close by, which has the power to make the dead living again, albeit as horrible zombies.In my opinion, Stephen King movies usually works very well as mini-series because the characters are more fleshed out and their inner lives are explored more thoroughly. There's no time for this here though, so the characters feels a bit hollow and we don't get to know them all that well.Relative unknown Dale Midkiff and Denise Crosby lead the pretty anonymous cast, the best acting performance of the movie is Fred Gwynne as old-timer Jud Crandall.Overall, this plays pretty much like a standard horror flick, more or less, with average acting but with a better-than-average script and it builds tension well. Top marks to the makeup department though, for making the zombies look pretty good.",Pet Sematary
160,jaysilentbob37,A solid adaptation of one of the most horrifying novels ever written. Daring and deeply unsettling.,8,15 July 2010,"Few horror experiences can compare with reading Stephen King's Pet Sematary for the first time. If anybody has the art of terror flawlessly mastered, it's Stephen King. The man can make even the most hokey concept terrifying, through his mastery of word use and his deeply intricate characterizations which make the horror feel more close to home. One of the finest examples of this is Pet Sematary. On page, it's as scary as can be. Naturally, it would be quite difficult to fully capture the novel's full terror in a film, but with the help of Stephen King's faithful screenplay and competent direction and acting, Pet Sematary is as scary an adaptation as we could possibly want.Pet Sematary is a relentlessly brutal horror story about a close, loving family whose world is gradually torn apart in the most devastating and horrible manner imaginable. King spares none of his characters the worst possible fates, even fates worse than death. I won't spoil anything for those who don't know what that entails. Suffice to say, you may want to sleep with the lights on for a few nights after this one. It's rough, bleak, unforgiving stuff.As a fan of the book, all I can say is, well done. It's as realistically faithful to the book in all the ways it needs to be, and some of the scares translate very well to the screen. The character Zelda, for example. Terrifying in the book, just as scary in the film. And the story's most tragically horrible event is as shocking and upsetting as it was in the book. As in the book, death is dealt with in a disturbingly frank manner. Psychologically, this is as harsh as it gets.Naturally, the film does pale in comparison to the book and isn't without its flaws. Stephen King's style isn't easy to translate to the screen as a lot of his plots are driven by what the characters are thinking, and King taps directly into their minds and tells us how they rationalize some very bad decisions. Since this isn't nearly as easy to accomplish on film, the characterization suffers. The acting makes up for it for the most part. It's nothing spectacular, but the actors are competent and as likable as they should be.Overall, despite the flaws, I highly recommend Pet Sematary, though I'd read the book first. I wouldn't recommend it for anyone who can't handle extreme grimness or a little graphic gore. 8/10",Pet Sematary
161,mrosesteed,Sinister and solid,8,22 April 2019,"Although it suffers some from mediocre acting (with the exception of a classic, memorable performance by The Munsters' Fred Gwynne) and an overly campy climax, this adaptation of Stephen King's novel is, on the whole, solid, effective, and compact. Its themes of death and loss and moments of shock and gore are well juxtaposed with a bright, colorful visual style, which effectively depicts the happiness the Creed family is desperate not to lose, even as horror creeps into their lives. In the film's darker moments, well photographed shadows and well designed sets and sounds punctuate the eerie mood that builds up to the film's inevitably grim conclusion.",Pet Sematary
162,asam3122,All in the Music,9,24 November 2005,"Pet Semetary (1989) 9/10 The Creed family have just moved into the small town of Ludlow. The family consists of a father, Louis, a mother, Rachel, a brother Gage, and a daughter, Ellen. They are greeted with kindness by Jud Crandall. Jud is 89, and could basically tell you about the entire history of Ludlow.Behind the Creed's new house, there is a path leading to a pet cemetery (spelled pet sematary). When Ellen wants to go up to see it, Jud willfully takes the family on a trip. That is the start of hell for the Creed family.When Rachel and the kids are gone, Ellen's cat Church dies. Jud feels that Ellen isn't ready for the death of her cat, so he suggests Louis follow him further up the path, past the pet cemetery.Jud tells Louis of this burial ground, once used by Micmac Indians. Louis buries Church, without Jud's help. A couple of days later, Church returns, alive, but from hell.This movie was one of two horror movies that could actually scare me, aside from ""The Exorcist."" The greatest performance would ever be Zelda, Rachel's sister with spinal meningitis, or Victor Pascow, a ghost who tries to help the Creeds from making the mistake of bringing back things from the dead.The music in this movie plays an extravagant part. It is at the same time sad and mysterious. It goes along with the movie wonderfully.9/10",Pet Sematary

164,tpkrause1,The better version.,8,22 August 2019,"It's older, and maybe stylistically a bit dated, but it's the better version of the two, imo.First, it doesn't mess with the story, which is great because you don't need to mess with the story. The book is good. Aside from the obvious (no spoilers) character switch, it was structurally better. Like the book, it's not a scary-right-off-the-bat horror story, like a slasher movie would be, kill scene at the top. Rather, it's structured more like a campfire story. It starts pretty normal and then, piece-by-piece, the horror builds. This is not very common for horror these days, but I don't think it is non-existant. More experimental films have been using it - Midsomer or Hereditary, for example, or Aronofsky movies. Wish either of those filmmakers would have tackled the remake, gone Kubrick and pushed King ""artfully"" as opposed to ""pop,"" but I digress. King said this was the first the he really wrote which disturbed him due to the major 180-degree plot point mid-way, and this movie has a strong sense of that devastation. The best horror is often about family.Second, the cast is better in this version, probably more due to the directing than the actual actors. Mary Lambert let the actors tell the story, Kevin Kolsch, like they do these days, told the story with camera work, editing, and modern horror tropes - the unnecessary masks and the juxtaposition of ""cute innocence"" (ballet dancing) with ""evil,"" for example. Jason Clarke and John Lithgow didn't get to flex. Dale Midkiff was a BABE and we had enough time with him to see the progression of his character. Fred Gwynne is unbeatable. And Denise Crosby, who bravely chose an often unflattering portrayal of Rachel, is hard to forget. The Zelda stuff, although less developed than the new, overdeveloped stuff in the new film, is just scarier. Her hardness early on really works against her crumbling development later - it's a hard choice for an actress' popularity but better storytelling. (Denise Crosby is an interesting actress - I think only one season in Next Generation? And still unforgettable. She makes an impact in whatever she's in, but again I digress.)As an English teacher, I'd say read the book! Then watch the movies and choose your favorite version, and let us know what you think! Happy watching!",Pet Sematary
165,jg_1977,"Half creepy classic horror movie, half cheesy stupid fun",7,16 October 2018,"Pet Sematary is one of those movies on the cusp of greatness, where if you made a few changes it would surely be considered a classic along with the likes of Carrie and The Shining. The general story is terrific and chock full of potential, a once happy family suffers a tragedy that drives the husband to insanity and he turns to the sinister pet ""sematary"" behind their property. The issues this movie has are far more fixable. First things first, get rid of Dale Midkiff. His performance in the first half is stiff and stilted that gives way to a schlocky portrayal of insanity in the second half. Had this film been better cast, the emotional weight it was hoping for would have been much more achievable. Next, take out the attempts for over-the-top gross-out horror. Thankfully there isn't much, but you'll still see two or three scenes. It works the first few times when you just get sudden glimpses of a mangled corpse or a deformed, sickly body, but much of the last half is full of long, uncut shots of late 80s horror effects which are highly subpar and kill any legitimate terror. Finally, tighten up the dialogue here and there and remove one or two on-the-nose scenes (I'm looking at you askew picture frames during a dream sequence), and you have yourself a great film. Generally speaking, I quite enjoy the first half of this movie. It builds suspense quite well, uses jump scares rather effectively and not at all cheaply, and expertly establishes a creepy and unsettling premise. Then the second half craps the bed, but at least in an entertaining way. Midkiff's laughable performance along with the cheesy effects as I mentioned, make the climax incredibly stupid but still fun nonetheless. If you can forgive this movie for all of it's dumb and dated moments then you can get something really special out of the scenes it does right. The design of the pet sematary, Fred Gwynne's iconic performance, and some truly great scares all hold up to this day. In another timeline, this movie could be a classic, and I only wish more people in this timeline would see it.",Pet Sematary
166,Spellbound88,Pet sematary or pet mockery? That's the question.,1,29 January 2019,"Sadly, this wasn't horror, from a personal perspective. As a Stephen King fan, I feel let down.
The year was 1989 and although special effects were weak, this was just plain awful and shameful.
The acting is probably the only portion of horror I detected in this movie.
An overall cringe galore, with truly laughable scenes. Any instance meant to depict true horror, despair, death or hopelessness, ended up looking like a laughable mockery.
I would've thought twice before releasing anything like this.
Just for reference - I'm not a fan of too much gore, blood and senseless killing sprees, and loved the adaptation of ""Misery"" starring Kathy Bates, now that was a masterpiece.
This was absolutely ridiculous, tacky, cheap looking, not convincing and sad. Not looking forward to the remake either.",Pet Sematary
167,icfarm,"""I finally came back for you, Rachel . . . . """,9,18 June 2007,"The book ""Pet Sematary"" is, perhaps coincidentally, perhaps not, one of the deepest AND most frightening things that Stephen King has ever written, possibly because he was driven to write by two things that happened in his own family - The death of the family cat and the near death of his son, at that time a toddler, who ran toward the road. According to one of the extras on this DVD, King thought of the basic outline of the story as he was carrying his son, who he had successfully stopped from running into traffic, back toward his home.This story is, quite literally, about death itself; the conflict between Louis (Dale Midkiff) and Rachel (Denise Crosby) over what, if anything their young daughter (Blaze/Beau Bernthal) should be told about death; the ACTUAL death of the family cat, followed shortly by the son (adorable and born actor Miko Hughes). The question: If you knew of a way to bring back the pets/people you loved and lost, would you do it? For Louis, the answer, tragically it turns out, is YES. Early on in the film, his is cajoled into ""promising"" his daughter that nothing will happen to their cat, Church, although he knows the futility of promising her that ""nothing will happen"" to anyone, as this is ultimately beyond his or any human being's control. When the cat does indeed die by being run over by a truck, his is guided by Jud Crandall (the wonderful Fred Gwynne) to the Micmac burial ground, a place where dead animals - or people - who are buried will come back. Although the film makes no reference to this, the book mentions the ""wendigo"", a spirit in Native American folklore that can possess a human and turn them into a cannibal - the implication being that perhaps it is a ""wendigo"" that is reanimating the bodies of people and animals that return after being buried on this ground. In any case, what comes back ain't the same, and it ain't pretty. In the case of Church, it doesn't seem to be THAT big of a deal; the kitty seems moodier, hisses a lot and, in one ""EEEEWWW"" scene, tosses the remains of a nicely mutilated mouse into the tub while Louis is in it. Yucky, but the cat isn't going to kill anyone. Meanwhile, Rachel has explained her hang-up about death to Louis, telling him the unpleasant story of her sister Zelda, who died of spinal meningitis - while a very young Rachel had been left alone with her. Rachel is quite literally haunted by her sister; haunted by guilt over having wished by the end that her sister would just die and end her own and everyone else's suffering. She admits to being frightened as a child that she would be accused of murdering her sister by people who knew her every thought and feeling. Scary stuff.But then, adorable toddler Gage is killed when he runs after his kite toward traffic, and his father is NOT able to stop him in time. There ensues, of course, deep grief, and a nasty fight between father-and-son-in-law, between whom there was never any love lost before Gage's death, at the funeral service. This scuffle, in film and book, leads to the little coffin being knocked down and, momentarily, jarred open, giving us a heartbreaking glimpse of a small boy's hand and funeral suit cuff.Shortly after the tragedy, Rachel and Ellie go to stay with Rachel's parents for a time, leaving Louis at home by himself (see where this is going?). Louis, perhaps inevitably, does bury his little son in the forbidden burial ground, and the results are far more horrific than before. Gage comes back, a killer still packaged in the body of a sweet little boy. His first victim, in one of the most genuinely frightening scenes, is old Jud (the shot of the knife slicing his heel is truly cringe-worthy). Louis, who has gone home exhausted and fallen asleep, wakes up to remember what he has done. Then, the phone rings. Louis hears his tiny son's voice again, asking him to ""come play"". He goes, taking with him a vaccine he has prepared that can be used on any resurrected body to ""put it back to sleep"". He gives this first to Church and it works. Next is Gage - but before a surprisingly believable fight between a grown man and a three-year-old boy, Louis discovers that Gage has already claimed TWO victims - Jud and RACHEL, who got to the house first and saw Gage just after imagining that she was being confronted with her long-dead sister, who warns her that she will ""never get out of bed again!"" Foolishly, Rachel rushes to embrace her boy, who says to her, ""I brought you something, Mommy"" . . . that something is a knife.Having long since been pushed beyond sanity, Louis administers another syringe of the drug to his little son, who does indeed go back to sleep . . . and buries his wife in the forbidden ground. What happens next is probably the biggest difference between book and film . . . but I've gone into enough detail. The book AND movie are recommended for all my fellow King fans, just don't read the book's ending at night before going to bed and trying to sleep (I made that mistake once).Cheers.",Pet Sematary

169,adudewhoiscool,Not as good as hoped.,5,23 March 2007,"""Pet Sematary"" is a disappointing film. From the premise and the fact that the author, Stephen King, was working on the screenplay, this reviewer expected something a little better than the average horror film. Unfortunately, it is just barely an average horror flick. There will not be any comparisons to the novel, because this reviewer has yet to read it. However, judging from the results of the film, this reviewer is not excited to read it.""Pet Sematary"" is based on the novel written by Stephen King. The Creeds have just moved to a new house in the countryside. Their house is perfect, except for two things: the semi-trailers that roar past on the narrow road, and the mysterious cemetery, which is misspelled to spell sematary, in the woods behind the house. The Creed's neighbors are reluctant to talk about the cemetery. Is there really something wrong with the cemetery or is the neighborhood extremely crazy?There is no question that this movie could have been a lot better. The movie was not exactly horrible. There were some good little creepy moments throughout. Unfortunately, the tension was never consistent until the very end. Sadly, that sequence towards the end felt like the typical 1980's slasher. Not only that, but the film score, which usually is key in this type of movie, is essentially nonexistent.The acting was very mediocre. Luckily, for this type of movie, the acting is never a necessity. Dale Midkiff played the father, Lois Creed. Fred Gwynne was really the best part of the film, as the neighbor, Jud Crandall. Denise Crosby was Lois' wife, Rachel Creed. Brad Greenquist, along with Fred Gwynee, was the best part as a guardian angel, Victor Pascow. Child star, Miko Hughes, played the youngest son, Gage Creed. Blaze Berdahl played the daughter, Ellie Creed.Overall, even though this reviewer pointed out some flaws, ""Pet Sematary"" is still a recommended one-time viewing. Some people loved it, so maybe you might be one of them. Some people consider this underrated and a classic, but this reviewer feels it is not even close. Maybe the 2008 remake will be better. Go rent this flick, see it, and then quickly forget about most of it the next day.",Pet Sematary

Two, however, for the underlying philosophical topics of 'meaning of death' and 'what if we could resurrect some being' as introduced by the helpful (?) neighbour.The rest is pure nothing. Why should the neighbour help out with something that he himself knows didn't work for his own dog? Why would that young deceased boy pop up over and over, since he wasn't any of those, and warn the doctor? What about 'not looking down'? What's the point of her sister popping up? She had died of MS, and that's all. Neither murdered nor resurrected.
Maybe all this was in the book, but then it still makes no sense in a way as depicted in the movie.From the angle of cinematography, one would have wished to create suspense by generating scenes of bright sunshine and of somber, threatening, ghostly mood. Especially the latter failed. No 'vibes', not the path (glowing left or right??), not the cemetery as such. The director's only means to achieve that was blood, ugly bodies, a jumping cat. Plus completely messed up household, furnitures, whatnot. Who had done that, and what for? Nobody probably knows.I can only consider the whole lot an abject failure.",Pet Sematary

In fact it starts off great with plenty of suspense provided by the unseen cemetery and what it could possibly do. Unfortunately it starts to roll ever more quickly downhill when you see what actually does come back. Problem is it simply isn't scary. Cats with attitude problems and pale kids just don't do it for me. The wives bizarre sister Zelda was the creepiest thing is this film and should possibly have been used over the little kid or the cat.I agree with whoever said it had a kind of Tales From The Crypt schlocky ending.

177,Dellamorte_Dellamore07,The Best Stephen King Adaption. **** out ****,10,11 August 2006,"What a grim and mean spirited movie!!! A horror movie with nothing good to come of it are usually my favorite types, when the harm that is caused is more or less from the characters own doings (Another flick that does this expertly is Requiem for a Dream),that the characters refuse to accept what their reality is and only make things worse by doing so. Requiem for a Dream had Drug Addiction over Delusion and here we have Grief over Resurrection.At first George A . Romero was suppose to direct but backed out, which wasn't necessarily a bad thing and MAry Lambert took over. Many seem to dislike Mary Lambert's direction for the story, but I think the fact she directed ""Siesta""(1987) in which a female dare devil had to accept reality before she could go on, was a given that Ms. Lambert had experience at working with ""the necessity for accepting change"" as she puts it.The plot is genius from the get go. The Creed Family move into their perfect country home in Ludlow, Maine accept for two flaws,1) the huge Semis that storm by day and night (perhaps hinting at Symbolism that death and destruction are always near by and can strike at any moment) and 2) a Spooky Pet sematary with a secret (resurrection of loved ones, but there's a brutal price to pay). These two flaws make them selves known to the family, and the plot unfolds these secrets until the films brutal climax.The acting is a bit off at times sure, and the pace is a little rushed towards the end, but I was too engaged to let those things really bother me. What the movie was asking and saying outweighed those flaws. Death is something EVERYONE has to relate too, and it's something that probably millions fear, but as the movie states ""Sometimes DEad is better"" which is quite obvious, you have to accept whats what, it's something you have to face and accept no matter how cray or sad it may seem, otherwise it will make things worse. Dale Midkiff was the perfect Louis Creed, and Fred Gymne was the best performance in the whole movie, make Jud Crandall one likable character. Denise Crosby did what she had to do quite well, even though she appeared one dimensional at times. Miko Hughes is my favorite child actor.This is Mary Lambert's greatest achievement so far. She gives the film a very spooky absorbing look, stylish but not too over the top (she waited till PS2 but it actually worked to help its offbeat screenplay). I mean, she was responsible for Madonna Music videos. She smartly pays more attention to the story though and handles everything quite well. The use of the semi trucks and some scenes with them were genius. The Suspense was high and she gave the film the mean streak that stayed true to the book.The biggest fault though is by King himself (Go figure). His Screenpaly was quite rushed, as if he feared the audience wouldn't like a layered movie. At times he skips all times for character development in favor of all the spooky happenings. The slow but well made evolution to the resurrection in the book is lacking in the movie. One minute its the funeral and then its up to the burial ground. More grief and sorrow would have upped the stakes. The walk up to the pet sematary was expertly done with the cat's resurrection (all about that freaky noise) but the second time it was so rushed, in the book it was one of the most terrifying things, but in the movie it happens too quickly.The music by Elliot Goldenthal is freaky and sad at the same time and suits the movie perfectly. I especially liked the opening credit theme.The movie is very mean spirited and gory. Very much so. It doesn't apologize for the gruesome sights it shows and maybe why a dimwitted hack named Leonard Maltin gave it a BOMB rating. What a moron. The movie has much to serve in the gore department. Thank you MAry Lambert. We have a dude with a smashed in head and you can see his brains, a frozen dead cat, mutilated rats, a kids chewed off leg in a flashback, a resurrected dog with that was killed by rusty barb wire,a sick and ugly deformed bed ridden sister in flashback, semi running over a kid (though just the thought is enough and we don't see the aftermath), but once a scalpel is brought out it got INTENSE, swipings, eyes gouged out, Achilles tendons cut, mouth slashed, half eaten faces, the grisly works that makes 3 Friday the 13ths gore to shame.Overall a rare horror treat, one that is somewhat of a classic to some, and an awful movie to others (but you can probably imagine why) **** out **** PS. I actually dig the sequel which if in the wrong hands it could have been as bad as people say, but it's Mary Lambert in the directing chair again and she makes it work.",Pet Sematary

179,manisimmati,"A Preachy, One-Dimensional Horror Parable",6,27 July 2017,"The Creed family has a sweet house cat named Church. Unfortunately, it gets run over by a truck and dies. The family's neighbor Jud has a suggestion: Why not bury Church in the mysterious ""Pet Semetary"", which is hidden near their house? The father Louis Creed dares to do it. And what do you know, the next morning Church is alive and well again. But he does seem somewhat different  Has Louis disturbed the border between life and death? ""Pet Sematary"" is an allegoric horror flick, based on the Stephen King novel of the same name. The screenplay was written by King himself. That seems promising, but it turns out to be disappointing. The script is fast-paced, but way too preachy, focusing on the trite tagline: ""Sometimes, death is better."" The message here is painfully obvious, which makes the movie a rather dull affair. I didn't care for the actors, either. Fred Gwynne apparently enjoys his role as the shady neighbor, but he chews the scenery like there is no tomorrow. And Dale Midkiff as Louis Creed is so wooden, you can't get into his character. That's especially true in the last third, where he's acting like a total nut job.Director Mary Lambert saves this movie from being a flop. She treats us with some seriously creepy and gory scenes. But she doesn't always find the right tone. In some parts, you're not sure if you're supposed to wince or laugh. There's an undead sidekick named Victor Pascow. I guess he was meant to be funny, but it's not entirely clear. During the finale, ""Pet Sematary"" mutates into an exponent of the slasher genre, which is entertaining enough, but doesn't help the story at all. The ending is downright laughable. I enjoyed it quite a bit - on a trash level, mind you.You can get some thrills out of ""Pet Semetary"", but I can't wholeheartedly recommend it. The story is too crude and the execution too muddled.",Pet Sematary
180,sean-57842,Nope.,4,17 January 2020,"Incredibly awful Stephen King story that should have just stayed as a novel. With your active imagination filling the gaps, this might just work.

181,charliesonnyray,A Decent Horror Flick,6,13 November 2016,"Stephen King is often hailed as the master of modern horror with his suspenseful scenarios and unforgettable characters. He himself though will claim that he is just an entertainer and his works won't become classics. That sums up my thoughts about this film adaption: scary and engaging but nothing that great. Our movie follows the Creed Family as they move into a small house across from a kind yet mysterious stranger named Jed. They also live near a busy road where tons of trucks go by and often kill many local pets. So of course, the Creed's cat gets run over. Jed decides to show Louis Creed-the father-a secret burial ground behind the titular pet cemetery. If you bury anything in this special ground, it will come back to life though they won't be the same. So of course, things start going downhill when Louis buries other things there. As a whole this film is quite frightening but has many flaws. Though the main focus is on this cursed cemetery, we also focus on a ghost that is trying to help the family and the psychological trauma Louis' wife Rachel is still experiencing from a childhood incident. They are kind of out of place but they connect better if you think about it in a thematic sense. The whole film is centered around death and how people deal with it. The trauma the wife goes through could be about how death can scar people while the helpful ghost could be trying to represent the fact that those who passed away before us help us from beyond the grave-though in reality it's more through what they left behind. However, this kind of logic doesn't help the fact that there are some Stephen King clichés sprinkled throughout this flick. Personally, I think these little tropes drag me out of the story and just remind me that I am watching a Stephen King movie. However that might not be the case for everyone. The disjointed nature of the story is what really hurts the movie as some things just seem to happen that don't really relate to the movie as a whole. It's like little story pockets here and there that don't add up to much. The acting though manages to make up for this. Jed-played by Herman Munster himself!-does a pretty good job actually being both creepy, friendly and dramatic. The family though are more of a mixed bag. Louis has some pretty good moments when the character is dealing with serious pain but in a normal situation, he comes off as distant and uninterested in what's going on around him. The actress who played his wife also seems to have the same situation. The children surprisingly are pretty good despite being so young. The special effects are also very convincing and look incredibly realistic. They are complimented by the use of dutch angles which makes everything look off and weird. These two elements combined make the movie pretty creepy. But the thing that really cements this horror story is the ending. All I can say is that is it is possibly one of the most gruesome ends in film history. Period. Overall, Pet Sematary is a bit of a jumbled mess but what it does right, it does very well. If you want to see a depressingly dark horror movie about death, then give Pet Sematary a look because you won't forget it! Trust me O_O",Pet Sematary

183,horrorflicklover,Absolute horror perfection,10,4 November 2014,"Pet Sematary did it all right. It's simply an incredibly chilling, engaging, and SCARY movie. Even King himself admits that the book scared him (although that's probably partly due to the real-life circumstances which inspired him to write it).As of this writing, Pet Sematary is 25 years old, yet it doesn't feel dated by Hollywood standards of horror. Take a film like Psycho. A masterpiece of it's time, yet it simply doesn't scare people anymore. But Pet Sematary? If it doesn't freak you out, YOU might be dead. It can hold a candle to any film released today in regards to overall scariness.I've heard people complain about some of the acting, but I can't even hear those complaints-The rest of the film by far overshadows it. The screenplay was magnificently adapted from the novel, the direction, pacing and cinematography are all outstanding. This film is hard to stop watching because the build-up, execution, and climax are all well-done, and quite scary. It keeps you involved, wondering what comes next, it's not lagged or bogged down. It's not over-the-top or cartoonish, considering the themes.Provided, the source material for the film was excellent. However, we all know all-too-well what can happen when short-sighted directors and sloppy screenwriters get a hold of a good product. As Stephen King wrote the screenplay as well, that fear is eliminated. And Mary Lambert did an outstanding job of putting it all together. You would have to think that King (being greatly connected to the film adaptation) wouldn't allow her to butcher it even if she could have! The film is gory, but not ridiculous ""oh here we go"" types of gore. Rather, it's appropriate for it's form, and well-placed when and where it's needed to top off the darkest scenes of the film. This way, it actually COMPLEMENTS the film, instead of dragging it down and making you roll your eyes in disgust.Pet Sematary isn't just about the horrifying supernatural, rather, the darkness of man (a theme in many King works) is ever-present as well. What drives the film in the direction that it goes is how far a man (Louis) would go to cope with his grief, and to spare his family the same. When he oversteps a sacred boundary between life and death, it becomes visible that he's opened Pandora's Box. Yet, his grief STILL drives him back to that same solution.On either side of Louis are the living and the dead trying to influence his decisions. Both with the same message, but one (admittedly, you must be familiar with the book to have picked up on it) seemingly controlled by the evil forces attempting to control Louis in the first place. Like giving a child candy and telling them not to eat it, just so you can punish them once they do.And that leads right in to part of what makes it so horrifying: That this movie is also very sad. There's no happy ending, no resolve for the good guys. It's self-destruction at it's finest, leaving no stone unturned. There's no bright spots in this film, because everything came crashing down in the worst way in both the living and the supernatural. It makes it a film which one can find scary for more than one reason.If you want to see a film that will TRULY give you chills, you must watch Pet Sematary. Truth be told, I put it above my beloved slasher flicks. Because I think that while those films have their merits in style and story, Pet Sematary succeeds far more at being a truly terrifying experience. I might sooner let a young child watch Nightmare on Elm Street than Pet Sematary, and that's saying a lot! It's films like this that make me understand that while I'm not in Stephen King's books, I see WHY he is hailed as a horror mastermind.",Pet Sematary
184,ablebravo,Could have been SO much better,1,22 October 2005,"As a horror movie fan, I must say that this one just didn't do it for me. Pet Sematary is my single favorite King book with The Shining and Carrie being numbers 2 and 3 respectively, both of which were made into real winners of films, but this one is a steaming pile. The direction was almost as bad as a Ewe Boll film, and it may as well have had a bunch of store mannequin as actors with the exception of Fred Gwynne as Jud Crandall-the ONLY redeeming part of this film. Preposterously stilted dialog (written by King himself!) delivered in a totally unbelievable and stilted way by the worst cast in film history, directed by Mary Lambert who must have been using a baseball bat on the ""actors"" makes this a really painful experience. If you have read the book, STEER CLEAR of this film- you'll probably curse King, Lambert and yourself for being led by the nose into this real bomb. I have an idea. Let Lambert and Boll work together on a new film. At least it will give us something to write about here in the IMDb comment boards. Actually, I have another idea. This film should be shown to film making students in a class titled ""DON'T DO IT THIS WAY!"" Utter Garbage. If King were dead, he'd probably rise up just to burn this drek.",Pet Sematary

The actors play well, Denise Crosby also known from ""Star Trek-The next Generation"" plays her role well. But the plot leaves much to be desired. Most of the plot is illogical and far-fetched. I did not read Stephen King's book so I can't say if the plot of his book is also illogical. Especially the characters act very illogical. For example: 1) Why does Mr. Goldman lead Mr.Creed to the graveyard at all when he knows what horrible things happened in the past? 2) Why does Mr.Creed bring his wive to the graveyard too(after her death) although he knows what horrible things happened to his son and the cat? I know that horror movies are not logical very often and that horror is the most important element. But this movie exaggerates a bit which its horror and so also with its illogicalness.",Pet Sematary

I am writing in for the sole purpose of giving some props to the character that drove Pet Sematary home for me as one of my favorites. I'm 20, in the navy, in the barracks where I'm on restricted duty, unable to move around because I'm awaiting a hearing. I grab King's novel for the first time and start reading. It's 5 in afternoon. By 9 that evening I'm still reading. ""I Wanna Know What Love Is"" by Foreigner is playing in the background, write around the time Jud Crandall is telling Louis about the boy that got buried up in the MicMac burial ground. It's so surreal. I was despondent about own situation earlier, until I'm drawn into this story...that makes me forget about my problems. I'm thinking about Timmy Baterman...and realized for the first time I've been gripping the book in my hands. To everyone who thinks zelda is the most frightful, you're entitled to think so. I can't and won't knock her because so many of you mention her name in these comments she cannot be denied. But my own favorite part of Pet Sematary in both the book and 1989 movie is the Baterman flashback because it takes me bake personally to that night long ago when was at a low point in the navy. I'm Black, and that song by Foreigner is the only one etched in my brain because the Stephen King book. I wrote just to give Timmy some honorable mention because obviously I am the only one affected by his presence in PS. Zelda I don't ever even blink about. I have watched the movie a dozen times and read the book 5 times. Each time I look and pay close attention to her...trying to see what the big todo is all about. I get nothing from Zelda at all. Sorry. But to each his own. I do respect her a major contributor to overall fabric of the story however. She matters. She's just not scary to me. By the creepiness and madness surrounding Timmy Baterman gets my attention every time. Pet Sematary is forever in my Top Ten Favorites...both as a book and a movie (the 1989 version...not the 2019).

This idiot after bringing back his dead son, after seeing the results on his cat, then brings back his dead wife, and tries to make out with her ! This guy was just a total moron.

My personal take on Pet Sematary is it's a timeless classic. I'm an avid horror fan and watched every horror/ thriller out there. There's just something about Pet Sematary that's been embedded in my mind for the last 35 years, and that's hard to do. Back in 88, I was a freshman in high school. My friend's and I went to opening night of Pet Sematary. Scared the living hell out of us. Grew up with all the 80's slasher flicks, but never in my life have I had to beg my friends to sleep over, and they much obliged. They didn't want to be alone either. I would say I couldn't sleep for a week. The thought of Zelda and Gage under my bed, brought a fear I've never felt before. Lol.Honestly, I still can't sit through the whole movie. Back then I didn't have kids, the loss of a child didn't bother me as much. Now... when you have kids, the horror and sadness of the film takes on a whole new experience. In that sense, it's a scarier and more emotional movie than it was back then. At least for me. Through the the years, I haven't come across too many horror/thrillers that left an impact on me. I'm a big fan of the Conjuring, Hereditary, and a couple more, I can't think of at the moment, but I'm sure you get my drift. The only thing more upsetting and scary to me is Director Mary Lambert choosing to direct Pet Sematary 2. What the hell was she thinking? Lol.",Pet Sematary

She takes an austere, uninspired approach to direction.  She dutifully films every sequence, but without any art or craft.And they should know by now that King can't write screenplays worth a darn, neither.  I love the man's earlier books ('Salems Lot is still my favorite) but his screenplays usually aren't very good (Creepshow being the only notable exception).If I were to re-make this movie, I'd have David Fincher or Bryan Singer (or possibly Stuart Gordon) direct and have either Jery Goldsmith or Danny Elfman compose the score.

It is sometimes gruesome, sometimes disgusting, but never scary and is precipitated by a totally illogical act. How are we to believe that Jud would encourage the cat to be buried when nothing that had come back was ""right"". This sets off an increasingly insupportable chain of events. The accident which kills Gage does not wash with this parent. After the opening sequence with Gage wandering into the road, are we supposed to believe a loving parent would let a child get so far away from them, in the direction of the road, and turn his back on him? No way. Children of that age can get away quicker than you would think. That is why you watch them. Once this sequence of events is set in motion, the action is very predictable. The acting is pedestrian, except for Fred Gwynne who delivers, as always. The resurrected Gage violates all of my own personal guidelines for horror films regarding the treatment of children. I am not easily offended and I like horror movies, even bad ones (which this is), but that whole sequence is way over the top (when it is not making me think of Chucky).

197,aro-2,"Good film, great adaption. King fans shouldn't miss it...",8,19 August 1999,"Probably the most accurate Stephen King adaption yet. Not surprising, since King himself wrote the screenplay. The story follows the Creed family moving into a beautiful Maine house. One of the other residents is Jud, a pleasant old man who knows a few things about the area. One is the highway that runs right through their frontyard. The other is a path leading to the Pet Sematary, where children for decades have buried the animals killed by the highway. Soon enough, Ellie Creed's cat, Church, is found dead. Luckily, this happens while the family, with the exception of Louis(the father), is away for Thanksgiving. Jud takes Louis to another burial ground, beyond the Pet Sematary, where Church is to be buried. Later, Louis is greeted(not so politely) by Church. He's returned, appearing to have chewed his way out of the bag he had been buried in. Maybe he was buried alive. Maybe not. Nothing more I can say without ruining the story.Of all the King adaptions I've seen this would be the most terrifying. The characters are real and the situations are normal. Mary Lambert does a great job directing the proceedings. Suspense is kept fairly high throughout the film, due in part to the plot development. The scene where Gage is killed will stick in your mind forever. Then, of course, we have the conclusion. Easy to determine what's going to happen, but Lambert pulls off some genuinely scary, and sometimes disturbing, moments.Overall, this is a good film and an excellent adaption. If you enjoy being scared and don't mind being haunted by some occasionally disturbing images then ""Pet Sematary"" is just what you're looking for.

King himself is responsible for the script and has a cameo but it is beyond my comprehension why he would want anything to do with this production.The acting does not help anything.

199,GoreWhoreAust,This dog needs resurrecting,3,2 July 2010,"* Warning: Major Spoilers ahead* Watching Pet Semetary has made me understand why Hollywood does remakes. While the title has cache as a brand name and clout by association, originating from the pen of one Stephen King, this 1989 creep show is a strong candidate for re-incarnation. Let me just say that I completely understand the rose coloured glasses with which we sometimes remember films first seen in our youth. Even the best examples of horror, (Halloween, A Nightmare On Elm St. and alike) can often look dated, crappy and lame to eyes witnessing them for the first time, many, many years after their release. Sometimes these judgements can be unfair, not considering the time when the film was first relevant. Other times it can give clarity to a film's short coming and missed opportunities. Now, with my self-justifying out of the way, let's turn our attention back to Pet Semetary. Adapted from King's popular novel of the same name, box-office wise this film is probably his most successful page to screen horror adaptation, King even wrote the script. This alone is reason for a remake. It appears as though King may have been too close to the project, as the pace is slow, taking way too much to time to get to the inevitable and the subplots seem pointless. King seemingly didn't have the objectivity to self edit. The Shining and Carrie, while based on King's books were written for the screen by other writers, namely filmmakers, who could cut away the fat and get to the guts of the story all the while keeping a visual language in mind. From the very beginning of Pet Semetary we know the cat will die, the kid will die and everything will go horribly wrong for this generic family. It just takes so long to get there. A remake could pace it up, get to the kid dying quicker, which is the real drama of the story, and maybe spend more time with this evil re-incarnated baby. Another thing a remake could address is the numerous subplots. The whole thing about the wife's complex with death and her strange back story involving a hideously disabled sister can go or be made relevant in some way to the main plot. There's also the seemingly unnecessary feuding between the father and the wife's family which comes to a ridiculously over the top head at the baby's funeral. And what about the freaky house keeper who commits suicide? What was the point of her? Was she some sort of red herring? Perhaps this is all explained and relevant in King's book, but on screen it really doesn't work. I also thought that the resurrecting should have taken place in the actual pet cemetery instead of miles away in the sacred Navajo site. Despite rendering the title pointless, it is hard to believe the father could be convinced to trek all the way to this site not being told where he is going and what will happen there, let alone dragging a body with him. Maybe all this could have been made more palatable had the actors been better. While Fred Gwynne (of The Munsters) is probably the best of a bad bunch, the rest are terrible, especially the mother (Denise Crosby of Star Trek the Next Gen.) and who ever the little girl was who played the whining brat of a daughter, she should have been the one hit by the truck! At the heart of it all I really think there is a good story, creepy, dramatic and full of the kind of conundrums that make an audience think ""Would I do the same?"" it just deserves to be presented in a more considered and cinematic way.",Pet Sematary
200,wolfcub7,Stephen King should always write scripts for adaptations of his novels,9,20 January 2012,"The movie script was written by the original author, so the point and lesson of the story remains instead of turning into mindless horror. This movie is also definitely a treat to a fan of psychological horror and I believe to a fan of gore too. There is not much of gore but the little there is, is very...impressive.I was delighted to see how dynamically he got the entire point of the story and every crucial element into the first five minutes of the film. All of it happening during a sunny day in a relatively happy atmosphere, sets a fine mood to the movie; we get the feeling that this idyllic happy family is going to go through hell in an unusual way. And because it and the scene, crucially involves an innocent little baby, most people get emotionally drawn in immediately.Although it made it impossible to portray Wendigo even nearly the way it is in the novel while possessing the bodies, I was glad that they cast a 2-year old child as Gage. Because it is highly important for emotional effect that the child was a baby. And I consider that more important for a movie than having a full-blown Wendigo portrayed, even for horror. The only thing that bothers me is that Gage looks like he died quickly of some inner cause instead of an ugly death by a high-speeding truck. There is no way anyone could repair a toddler's body that perfectly after such a death. To have it come off even semi-believable, they should not have shown the full grown man so horribly mangled by a truck and thus create an illogical contrast.But, because showing Victor Pascow is crucial to the story and there is no way you could stuff the needed make-up on a toddler without torturing him and making it impossible for him to have patience to play nice, the beautiful baby body is excusable and doesn't distract too much. And what Wendigo-Gage did to the old guy was disturbing enough anyway, perhaps even more so with the angelic baby looks than it would've been if he'd looked like the zombie he was.The creepiest movie character ever; Zelda. In the novel she's actually a 10-year old child but here they had her be a full-grown woman although portrayed by a man...Anyway, I hated the Zelda-bits even in the novel, so I really did not enjoy them in a visual form in a movie. She's just TOO creepy in all fate, looks and the insane mentality and the things she says. Be warned; she is VERY disturbing and scary in this movie. Not as much in the novel.The story's point of how far a human being may go in his/her deepest and most immense grief, and how much horror a human mind can take before it goes insane...and most importantly the lesson of how sometimes dead is better...are the reasons why this story is worth knowing to anyone who can stand horror at all. Because I don't think there is any better way to make those matters clear, than this story's way is. It all just hits home perfectly well and memorably. Those basic points and the lesson this story tries to teach, are the reason why this is worth watching over and over again and isn't as disturbing and sick as this otherwise might be. Of course also the great actors add to the worthiness of watching. Especially Gage's, Louis' and Pascow's actors are spot-on. But Ellie's is rather awful...but bearable.The basic points and the lesson are brought up relatively well in this movie adaptation, but I think could've been done better if they'd dug more into the minds of the characters, at least by voice-over narrating or something.I'm not gonna spoil the ending but just want to say that the ending is hands down the most important part of a story because if the ending is utterly changed, the very essence of the story utterly changes, and therefore if you're not going to respect the ending of an author's story, there is no point in adapting the story into a movie at all. In most adaptations of King's novels, they change the ending. But not this time! This script was written by King himself. Thus, not only is this movie respectfully novel-faithful all in all but indeed the ending is what it should be; just like it is in the novel apart from one addition. But since it was by the same author, it doesn't count as a change of that kind. (And minus Gage's character who is much tamer in this movie than in the novel, but it's excusable because you can ask only so much of an actor who's at toddler age.) Sooo, this movie including the ending ought to be delightful for the fans of the novel and should creep the ever-loving crap out of also those who don't know the novel.Denise Crosby, (Rachel Creed's actress), has an interesting idea about the ending, which she revealed in the 20th Anniversary Reunion. After you hear that, you might enjoy this movie even more because it changes the way you look at its horror aspect, into a quite fascinating point of view. (Her idea is only her personal interpretation, NOT necessarily Stephen King's vision.)Hence the intense and in some sense disturbing horror aspect of this brilliant and deep story, you'll be happier if you don't watch this or even read the novel. But hence the basic points and lessons of the story, it is not all bad and can be essentially enjoyable. Consider carefully which format you can take without regretting the decision, or if you'd better just study the story without personally reading/watching it.",Pet Sematary

Seems the Indian ground can bring Fido or Fluffy back from the dead--if you don't mind having a raving hell beast for a pet. It can do the same for dead people--if you don't mind having a homicidal zombie around the house.Throw in a busy two-lane blacktop, speeding big rigs, a well-meaning (if somewhat dim) old neighbor, and one kid who really doesn't get enough supervision, and I think you can figure out what happens from there--an over-the-top, illogical mess, which, in all fairness, does offer up a few scares.Well, there are worse Stephen King adaptations (such as ""Maximum Overdrive,"" which King also directed).

Even if there is much blood, the scariest scene is about Zelda, Rachels sister (í'm sure everyone who saw this movie will agree this is one of the scariest things ever made in a movie). There are many positive things about this movie: a very good music, a good story, nice effects. Only thing that wasnt realy good was the last 20 minutes, which were a bit less scary, and the other thing was the wooden acting... I give it 8/10 (6th sense: 10/10).But anyway, if you want to see a good made horror movie with an interesting (also disturbing) story this is the perfect movie!PS: Guess from where M.

208,ca_dale,Saved by the interesting concept,6,14 January 2007,"I first stumbled upon this film around Halloween, a few years back. Although obviously not one of the stronger adaptations of a Stephen King novel, I was generally impressed with it. PS's theme of resurrecting dead pets and having them turn on their former owners is pretty cool, ""sometimes dead is better"" indeed.PS falters at times but what it does well it does with considerable effectiveness. The idea of an innocent child being resurrected as a sadistic killer, lurking in the shadows, is very creepy and unsettling. The filmmakers use this device to full effect to shock and unnerve the viewer. The lead up to the confrontation between Gage and Jud in the 2nd half of the film is especially tense. But by far the scariest part of the film is Rachel's childhood flash back of her sister. It made my hair stand on end.Unfortunately the acting and script leave a lot to be desired. The dialogue keeps coming across as forced and unnatural, as though the actors were reading off queue cards (or more likely word for word from the novel). The progression from one scene to the next is also a bit uneven and disjointed at times.Another problem is that PS often throws in tense, creepy, music just before something is about to happen to a character, ruining a lot of potential suspense. In particular the inappropriate overuse of tense music makes it so blatantly obvious what is going to happen to Gage at the mid point of the film that you almost have to hold back laughter when it hits, so to speak.Despite PS's weak acting, the plot is intriguing enough to hold your attention, and it should provide enough tense moments to satisfy horror fans. Just don't expect anything spectacular and you'll have a fun time watching it.",Pet Sematary

But instead, they made it into a an hour and a half long movie. Bad decision. You can't fit a 600 page book into 90 minutes. Nice try, though. One of the major problems is that the acting is terrible. Fred Gwynne was too fake as Jud Crandall, I think James Cromwell or Ray Walston would have fit the part better. Dale Midkiff and Denise Crosby try hard, but aren't believable. But Miko Hughes was perfect as Gage Creed. And everything is so cheesy! Stephen didn't do a great job at the screenplay. Another major problem is that King cut out or changed too much from the novel. Where's Norma Crandall? Or Steve Masterson? The movie's not all bad though. The scenes with Zelda are really creepy. And the last few scenes get really suspenseful, even if they are too graphic. I would have enjoyed the movie more if I hadn't read the novel. If you've read the novel, stay clear.

Its undeniably dated but then so have most horrors from the period , even greats like hellraiser and some off the acting isn't the best but its a decent well made horror film. What i loved about it was how it builds up the tension as a supernatural film before exploding in to violence at the end. Also some off the moments surrounding the child's death are surprisingly poignant. Overall an underrated horror film that while no classic perhaps deserves to be reconsidered.

The acting is atrocious, except for Fred Gwynne who manages to recite his corny lines with sincerity but without overacting. Everyone else, Dale, Denise and especially the little girl are absolutely atrocious, as is the actor playing the dead guy (he overacts; he seems to think he's in a Gothic ghost story). I think this may very well be the worst acted Hollywood movie I have ever seen. Mary Lambert, best known as the director behind Madonna's Like a Prayer and Like a Virgin videos (among others), doesn't seem to understand how humans act or speak. Stephen King novels and scripts are very hard to adapt because his words and description that work on the page are ridiculous when spoken or acted out. A director needs to know when to be literal and when to apply use of ""director's license"" to make gibberish and nonsense seem believable. There are some fun scenes (""Now I want to play with you!) and, again, Fred Gwynne (Mr. Herman Munster and Francis Muldoon), is actually good.

The primitive FX and spates of careless writing & acting don't undermine the viewing experience; even with major plot turns I could see from a mile off, I still felt the need to watch it unfold. Plus you've got Fred Gwynne, the Ramones, and a nice cameo from the literary genius himself halfway through. In my mind the only grating aspect here was the overused trope of the clairvoyant little girl. Can't imagine how they'll handle things in the hypothetical remake by Guillermo del Toro (!) but whatever its flaws, this one at least moves along briskly and keeps it simple.",Pet Sematary

And the resurrected baby in this was killed by an oil truck, but miraculously coming back with no indication of that. It was a good movie; I loved the soundtrack, the acting was good and the cemetery was very realistic, but it wasn't the best.

219,firetop14,Awful in all the right ways,8,6 June 2008,"A faithful and effective adaptation of the original Stephen King novel that also works well in its own right, portraying the original themes and tone superbly. In contrast to a lot of its fellow eighties horror flicks, Pet Sematary does not rely on gore to frighten its audience but instead juxtaposes different emotional extremes that have a far more sustained effect on the viewer. It may sound strange, but what makes this film different is that it does not simply include death, it is truly about death, and about the powerful and awful nature of grief.The film has a difficult premise - the resurrection of the dead - which if handled without care could have become a farce or just another zombie film. A strong cast ensure make the fantastical story seem believable. Particularly worthy of mention is Dale Midkiff, who plays the father, Louis Creed, who plays a difficult role convincingly and effectively. Also Miko Hughes, who for a 3 year-old was already almost unnaturally talented and who won the hearts of many Stephen King fans. The score for this film also goes a long way to make it what it is, the chilling discordance is reminiscent of earlier classics like Psycho.Of course, the film is by no means perfect. The dialogue is a little weak in places and is strongest when almost directly quoting the novel. Some people may find the whole thing too much and will laugh instead of cry, which is often expected when a film takes itself this seriously. And horror fans who were expecting a nonstop bloodbath may be disappointed or bored by a film that builds suspense slowly before snowballing to its final, terrible climax.In summary, this is a chiller rather than a slasher, but works because the horror is so very real and close to our own lives. The truly terrifying parts of this film are not the ""zombie"" scenes but the portrayals of human fallacies such as sickness, madness and ultimately death. A truly memorable classic that stands up to multiple viewings and stays with you long after the end credits.""What you buy is what you own, and what you own ... always comes home to you.""",Pet Sematary

This one goes from creepy to terrifying. Sure, it has a low-budget look at times: Fred Gwynne is a great acting talent, but the rest of the cast tend to get upstaged by the kids and the cat. But we don't watch horror films for the acting, and what drives this movie is a really disturbing plot. Don't expect a happy ending; and understand that, particularly at the end, this movie pulls no punches with its violence. It's not gruesome just to be gruesome, but it's very graphic.

The only catch is that it's not quite the same as it was when it was alive.Tragedy continues to strike the Creed family and Louis thinks that, if it brought back an animal, it can bring back humans and this will be a mistake that will change Louis' life forever.It's a strong concept by Stephen King and he and director Mary Lambert work extra hard to tell it in the scariest way possible.

224,WaxBellaAmours,"Condescending, useless adaptation of Stephen King novel",5,1 February 2012,"It sounded like a great idea on paper. Stephen King adapting his own novel on screen? Since most of the film adaptations of his novels have been criticized for deviating from the source, it would seem like he would be the perfect one to get his own vast, peculiar imagination displayed best on screen. True, ""Pet Semetary"" is probably one of the more faithful movies based on a King novel, following the narrative flow much more closely than other adaptations have. Unfortunately, something sounding great on the page doesn't mean it looks good on the screen. And ""Pet Semetary"", for all it's fidelity to the Pet Semetary book, is a truly Awful movie.Indeed, after reading ""Pet Semetary"", many of its ideas certainly we're great to toy around with inside the head. The book certainly highlighted a fascinating, universal idea (the ability to control death) and managed to make it truly terrifying, knowing the reader's own imagination would be the greatest catalyst for the book's greatest shocks, with King managing to effectively convey his musings on morality while allowing the reader to do their own coloring of much of the film's narrative action.That in turns makes the whole movie seem pointless and, in the details, rather silly on the big screen, where all the imagining is already done for us. In fact, this adaptation is just downright ludicrous. Some of King's more mercurial creations (the ghost of a dead student the film's doctor protagonist couldn't save, a skeletal-looking mentally ill sister of the doctor's wife, and don't forget a demonic toddler!) just look ridiculous on the big screen. Indeed we're not sure if the director is meaning to be Ironic, but as on-screen bogeymen there just goofy and absurd, and not in a good way. This film shows far too much, becoming far too explicit and ends up just being extremely condescending to the audience, for whom nothing but silent or uttered laughter seems to be the only appropriate response. And while King certainly knows how to write a novel, writing a screenplay is a different monster, and there are some awkward scene transitions and lapses in thematic explanations that make certain plot points that we're clear on page seem rather preposterous on screen.All in all, stick with the book. As condescending at that sounds, the silly film you're about to watch is going to do nothing but simply snigger at you while you do nothing but snigger back.",Pet Sematary

It's also directed really well I felt regardless that King dislikes it. Firestarter is a masterpiece compared to Pet Sematary! This is a laughable forgetful 80s horror movie.. the story and the movie were rubbish. It ripped off the The Amityville Horror soundtrack, then seemed to be trying to bring flavours of Nightmare on Elm Street 3 towards the end.. but it was such a pathetic story with the sidekick ghost and the completely illogical sequence of events when the kid comes back.. it reminded me of why I stopped reading Stephen King books after finishing the 21st one. Such 1 dimensional characters, often schmaltzy and relying on such stereotyped personalities. I'd heard that King absolutely hates Kubrik's Shining. I guess it must be difficult seeing someone take your schmaltzy 1 dimensional work, ignoring your repeated failings and crafting it into a suspenseful and a well directed movie! Stephen King is a writer whose stories only translate to screen well when a director completely ignores King's characterisations. Unfortunately I think the director here remained faithful to King's book as well as throwing in the cheap 80s schlock horror style, thus Pet Sematary ended up as junk.

But it must be acknowledged from the onset of this informal review that Stephen King is certainly one of the most hit and miss writers out there. When he's in top form he really shines, but when he's having an off period, well, he writes screenplays like ""Pet Sematary."" Maybe the novel was better.In this flick we are introduced to Louis and Rachel Creed (Dale Midkiff and Denise Crosby), the east coast's, maybe even the world's stupidest, most irresponsible and neglectful parents/pet owners. Upon their arrival to rural Maine the Creed clan, not two minutes out of the station wagon, lose track of their somewhat creepy baby, Gage (Miko Hughes), who wanders off towards the world's busiest road. This road is constantly occupied by roaring 18-wheelers. Constantly. Just as baby Gage is about to get himself pancaked by one of these big rigs, overly helpful neighbor Jud (Fred Gwynne, brandishing a monstrously heavy Maine accent that would cause even Titus, the Pepperidge Farm spokesman, to balk) sidles over and prevents the little nipper from getting himself splattered. Or should I say postpones.
Anyway, long story short, after their daughter Ellie's pet cat Church gets run over by truck, helpful Jud tells Louis (in confidence) to accompany him to the conveniently located local Indian burial ground (hey, didn't the idiots in `Poltergeist' have one of these literally damned things underfoot also?). Jud tells Louis to bury the cat there. Presto-chango, kitty is back, only now he's all evil and smelly. Really smelly.Fast forward a little more and before you can say, `whoops, there goes that stupid baby,' bango! There goes that stupid baby (the phrase `go fly a kite' takes on added significance in this sequence). Gage gets clobbered by one of them thar speeding trucks while mom and pop are yet again distracted by something trivial. These two are the most A.D.D.-addled parents ever to traipse across the screen. Well, dopey dad, against Jud's sagacious advice, scurries back over to the burial ground and alakazam! Junior is back. Only he's evil, too. Really evil (his smelliness factor is never gotten into). I won't spoil the rest of the fun (?), but suffice it to say these Indian burial grounds are a real pain in the ass for the unlucky schmucks who mess with them.All this, plus a flashback or two featuring Rachel's Amanda Plummer-like dead sister Zelda (played by a guy) who croaked of spinal meningitis, some visits to Louis by this Casper the friendly, recently departed college kid ghost and you've got what is at best an unintentionally funny comedy film. It is entertaining in a kind of, `how stupid are you people?' slap-your-head-in-disbelief kind of way. Scary? No. Oddly watchable, yes.
Oh, and there are some Ramones songs, the one that runs during the end credits co-written by Dee-Dee. Now he's scary.",Pet Sematary

The movie is very frightening but it's not so scary . It's a very good horror movie for the whole family i think. In this film there is a family which precisely have moved in to a new town, and there is this neighboor called Jud who is warning the family about the Pet Sematary. The Pet Sematary is a Graveyard for animals, which people have buried their dead animals in. If you are about to watch this movie i think, you should have someone with you like a girlfriend or something. So go now and watch this movie. I'll promise you it will be a surprise.

232,kevinp8192,Powerful horror that taps into adult fears,8,12 June 2004,"*****Spoilers herein*****What really scares you?  Killer sharks, or maybe ghosts trying to bring back a message?  Maybe a chainsaw wielding psychopath?Maybe.  But those fears don't even compare to a horror which people dare not even speak of or consider--and that is the death of one's own child.  ""Pet Sematary"" taps this base, primal adult fear, and then takes it to places that most could not bear to explore.I've read comments about this film that include poor acting, characters making stupid decisions, etc.  I disagree.  The acting is actually first rate for a film like this.  Maybe it is impossible for many to imagine the desperation resulting from such a scenario.  But the film's events are not only logical, they may be absolutely inevitable if such a scenario were possible.  This is the true horror of ""Pet Sematary"":  It isn't that pets and people come back from the dead as evil killers who hunt with knives and scalpels, it is that anyone who has lost a child could become so desperate as to commit the crimes that Louis Creed does.  Despite warning, or even past history.The movie takes those willing to go with it to the depths of a desperate human heart.  The heart of a protector trying to make up for not being able to protect.  And the results are horrifying.  In fact, when the film dives into slasher territory near the end, it's almost a letdown, although I believe it's perfectly logical how it got there.I am a true horror fan, and I contend that this is one of the scariest horror films ever made.  If you don't think so, see it again after you have children.",Pet Sematary
233,hasppfh,King does it again,4,24 March 2009,"Now, I haven't read the original short story to know all the literary points that went wrong here, so I'm not going to go down that path here.But I have some time ago learnt that Stephen King movies simply -are not- horror films, with perhaps a couple of exceptions. This was not one of them. It started well enough, and for once I'm not going to complain about the acting, although Fred Gwynne was as usual wonderful.. Also I will forgive the total lack of parenting skills, as they were necessary to make the story here move forward...But there was one consistent point that I couldn't help but get annoyed with. And that came pretty close to the end of the movie, and at least 2 characters partook in the activity of dumb stupidity. The moments I refer to are thus: There is a tiny zombie running around the house. You suspect it is under the bed. Do you (a) get as close to the bed as you can before blindly raising the duvet cover up, exposing pretty much your whole body to whatever damage such a teeny undead cannibal might inflict on you, or (b) move a little away from the bed so you can peer under the completely open end from a position of slightly increased safety, or at least see the mini terror coming at you, giving you a little reaction time.I know, let's go with (a).

234,TomCat502,Dead certainly would've been better in the case of this film.,3,29 November 2010,"Once upon a time, Stephen King novels and short stories were adapted to the screen and told by top notch directors using A-list actors. Fine performances and good films were created.Then they got greedy and every novel was rushed to the screen, made by any available director and portrayed by anyone they could afford.There are thankfully, notable exceptions(Stand by Me, Misery, The Green Mile) but most renderings have been terrible.And here we are. Mary Lambert created several stylish music videos for Madonna, but I'm afraid her direction on Pet Semetary shows her inexperience.Dale Midkiff, familiar for his appearances in cinematic and episodic television, mumbles and drawls his way through a very poorly drawn character.Denise Crosby, the wife/mother, is a favorite of mine from Star Trek - The Next Generation (Tasha Yar). Perhaps she's a contract Paramount player and took this after her STTNG stint. She certainly does try to deliver, but it's not very effective within the confines of this slopfest.Fred Gwynne is fine as the on screen narrator and is enjoyable until the end.The child actors aren't all that effective. Even the cat leaves me cold.The ending is just silly, and most everything leading up to it is dumb. Child's Play meets Psycho crossed with Night of the Living Dead.Somebody made this and it was rejected by Tales From the Crypt. However, instead of leaving it dead in the ground, this film's production team dug it up and placed it in the pet semetary.The rotten junk that crawled out is what we're forced to view.3/10.",Pet Sematary

236,Isnam777,A wonderfully scary and depressing film,7,22 April 2009,"Don't let the fact that I said depressing in the summary scare you out of seeing this movie. You'd just be cheating yourself out of one of the best Stephen King film adaptations out there. Director Mary Lambert weaves this movie, twisting its characters into some demented, dark fairy tale of human tragedy that seems to hint at something deeper and more important than your average, run-of-the-mill horror film presents.We start with the Creed family moving to a small, rural Maine town so the father Louis can take a job as a doctor at the local university. There are high hopes for this young family as they move into their new home the first day, but even as their new lives begin it is disrupted by their daughter Ellie falling and hurting herself from the tire swing in the front yard. This tiny tragedy is soon forgotten as we are introduced to greater dangers around their new home. First off, just beyond their yard is a busy highway where trucker traffic is a constant threat day and night. Second, though it doesn't appear to be a threat at first, there is a pet cemetery in the woods surrounding their house, and beyond that is another cemetery of sorts, an ancient Native American burial ground, but, get this, the natives stopped using it long ago because the ground is ""sour"".Their old, friendly neighbor Jud (played brilliantly by Fred Gwyne) helps them adjust to their new surroundings as they settle in. Then the family cat is killed by a passing semi one day when Louis is home alone. Knowing how much the cat means to Ellie, Jud shows Louis to the ancient burial ground and instructs him to bury the cat there. The next day, the cat shows up on the front step. It's alive but it seems to have gotten mean and nasty since its resurrection and frequently threatens Louis around the house. Sadly their cat is not the only member of the family to die on the busy highway and (in a disturbing and emotional scene) tragedy befalls the Creed house. This leads to Louis once again using the burial ground to restore his family, against Jud's adamant objections. But if you thought the cat was bad, people brought back to life from the burial grounds are just plain wicked, as if they are angry about being brought back to life, and they will seek revenge on those who were closest to them.The tone is dark and oppressive, and this movie is ultimately about tragedy, death and the destruction of a once happy and hopeful family. All the actors play their roles greatly, especially Midkiff (Louis) who gets increasingly numb and devoid of emotion as tragedy after tragedy takes his family from him. If you are looking for a horror movie that takes itself and the subject matter seriously, while also accompanied by worthy acting and directing, look no further than this title.",Pet Sematary

238,staggeredgenius7,A Horrific film that Could Have Been More,5,11 August 2000,"Last weekend while I was my grandparents in Virginia, I came across this movie on the Sci-Fi Channel.  I remembered as a kid how the box used to terrify me at the local Blockbuster and I decided to check it out.  For the first hour and a half, I stayed at the edge of my daybed as I thought to myself that this must have been ""The Sixth Sense"" of the 80's.  What makes the first hour and a half of this film so scary is that most of it could, and actually does happen.  Well, not the whole reincarnation thing, but the actual death of loved ones has destroyed much happiness in the world.  My mother whose brother got killed by a drunken trucker when he was three, had always talked about what it would be like to have him alive today.  This movie started as a philosophical example of that natural human impulse. Sadly, Mr. King wrote himself into a corner.  In the last half hour, the movie turns into a graphic piece of  slasher trash all to common in the 80's.  If only Mr. King had taken the high road like he did in ""Carrie"" and ""Shawshank Redemption,"" this film could have been remembered as the the masterpiece that turned horror around ten years before it actually evolved into art with a little kid who saw dead people and Bruce Willis.",Pet Sematary

For the time of the movie (and even now) the make up and zombie effect was pretty cool. I still get especially creeped out when little kids are the killers. Something about it is un-natural...but then again that was suppose to be the feeling that the viewer was to have. Creepy kid, lots of suspense, murders, strange old guy, and an evil undead cat. As an adult I still cannot bring myself to watch this without covering my eyes, remembering my experience as a kid.

240,sturedman7,one of the best stephen king adaptations ever,8,4 July 2009,"Pet Sematary tells the story of a family, The Creeds, who move to a new house in Maine. The house lies on a busy industrial road where massive trucks pass by the minute. Because of this, the road has taken the lives of many pets in the area, and the kids of the town bury their beloved pets in a small area of woodland which they affectionately call the ""Pet Sematary"". The Pet Sematary lies down a small laneway at the back of the Creeds home, and it is their new neighbour Jud Crandall who introduces the family to the area. But, as in all of Stephen King's books/movies, there's more going on here than meets the eye...Watching Pet Semetary was one of the rare cases that I had read the book before watching the movie, and it really added to it. With The Shining, a lot of people, including myself, had seen the movie before reading the book and then when I did read the book, I just couldn't imagine anyone else playing Jack Torrance other than Jack Nicholson.This is one of the reasons I enjoyed Pet Semetary so much. I had an image of all the characters in my head after reading the book and was really pleased with the casting of the movie. All of the parts are played excellently, but it is the wonderful Fred Gwynne who steals the show here, playing Jud Crandall. Special mention to the makeup crew for recreating the disgusting head injury that poor old Victor Pascow had to go through. Possibly one of the most disgusting make-up effects ever made.Great pacing, great acting, great screenplay (by Stephen King himself, oh and look out for his cameo!), this is easily one of the more successful adaptations of a Stephen King novel. Also, The Ramones songs ""Sheena Is A punk Rocker"" and ""Pet Sematary"" are incredible! And remember, the soil of a man's heart is stonier...",Pet Sematary
241,zackbutson,About as average as a movie can get,5,8 June 2010,"The plot of this film by Stephen King was a great one. But the rest of the movie was disappointing. The direction of Mary Lambert was poor, and the acting was bad if not horrible at times. Dale Midkiff was the weak link. He had some very unemotional, and flat out bad dialog such as his, ""Yuck! You kiss your own cat."" Granted it wasn't brilliant writing, but his reading was awful.The story had problems as well. It was predictable in the sense that they had many obvious foreshadows about where the plot would eventually wind up. The character of the ghost who warned the family, was useless. Scenes also relied on stupidity by the cast. An example being the dad turning away from Gage while he crawled onto the road.But ""Pet Sematary"" wasn't terrible. Besides the good Stephen King plot, the action sequence at the end was well done. The crew also did a good job in creating Zelda, who's scenes were by far more chilling than the rest.This is an average film that's disappointing due to the huge potential this story has. Instead of remaking already good horror flicks such as ""A Nightmare on Elm Street"" or ""Halloween"", I'd much rather see remakes that truly do need/deserve a better angle.",Pet Sematary

Yes, its a film that does try to be good. You can tell that everyone involved with it did what they could to make a good movie. Unfortunately the result was way less than awe-inspiring.While i don't consider this to be a ""bad film"", it is very lacking. The direction is... okay. What disappointed me the most was its complete lack of suspense. The editing is sometimes very choppy and that doesn't help either when you are trying to build up tension. The other thing is the writing. Now, I am a Stephen King fan, but every time i see that he wrote a screenplay... i get sacred. Because both times I've gotten very excited about that, I've been let down. King does try to stay faithful to his novel by almost never straying from the original story-line, which i appreciated, but some of it just doesn't translate to film that well.In the end, this is a perfectly enjoyable one-time watch.

The main guy Louis is a docter, and he has a beautiful wife, and two children. They even have a cat. Pet Sematary (child's misspelling) is a place where broken hearted children bury dead pets.

Rather, taking Pet Sematary at face value, it's a good story: young doctor and family move to Maine, meet a wizened neighbour, but then get into trouble because the ground is sour. Like a number of King stories, the area/town itself contains evil forces, or supernatural forces that end up evil. In a late career role, Fred Gwynne does an excellent job with the New England accent, not always done well by others. Good use of an unspoken tension between husband and wife, but not a lot of exposition on why it's there. She should've been frigid, but they have two children....Stephen King stories, like the films of Harold Ramis, often suffer from the same debilitating problem: unraveling, cheesy plot and/or effects at the end. A toddler of about three years wielding a scalpel without nicking himself? An unidentifiable malaise coming over the doctor, causing very serious lapses in judgment? A giant Munster of a man unable to withstand fatal attack by said toddler? The old man's house inexplicably turning mouldy and rotten within hours?However, it's pretty good.

I think Stephen king is overrated in general. he should never have made films, he fails as a filmmaker.if you love Stephen King and must watch his work, he has better films. the movie IT is better made, even though it has flaws also; but at least it's entertaining enough with some good material that it can sustain itself.",Pet Sematary

I love how the family photos appear on the road after Gage is killed. The weird visions and ""dream"" sequences are great. Denise Crosby, Miko Hughes, and Fred Gwyne were all great. Miko was especially good for his age. I also admire the balls this movie has. They kill a kid and animals, both of them twice!
Negative Points: My main issue with this film is Dale Midkiff. He has two facial expressions in the whole movie; Blank stare and scared. The only scene that seemed authentic from him was his ""NOOOOO"" when Gage is killed. Had he been cast differently, I'd probably give this movie an 8 or 9. My other complaints are quite minor. During the final confrontation between zombie Gage and his father, the dummy used for Gage is quite obvious at parts.
Final Verdict: Overall a good watch, but you're gonna have to deal with a wooden protagonist.

257,sign543,This Should Have Been Buried IN the Pet Semary!,1,9 November 2006,"I find it disheartening that so many of King's masterpieces were treated so badly in their film adaptations...and perhaps it's mostly because his books are too complex to adapt well to film...I'm not sure. Delores Claiborne, Stand By Me, Misery, Carrie, Shawshank Redemption, The Shining, and the Green Mile all did well. Then we are treated to stinkers like IT, Maximum Over-drive, Dreamcatchers, Thinner, The Running Man, Firestarter...and of course, this one.Did I forget to mention Stephen King's own remake of The Shining? He should have settled for the original.This film has all the feel of a made-for-TV movie or direct-to-video film...and, in fact, that's what it should have been. The film was terribly fast-paced and left out some of the more necessary plot elements of the book. They jumped into the darker elements way too quickly. There is barely a set up for the horror to come.That they left out Norma Crandall was very disappointing as she added to Judd's character so much. He's barely even interesting in the film. Fred Gwynn turned him into a goofy, drawling, old man. Over-acted. Not subtle at all, as his character was in the book.Ellie, the daughter, was a terrible actress. I am sure they could have found a better actress than her. She was whiny and abrasive and her lines were very forced and unnatural.Even the cinematography was badly done. Everything is way too bright for the plot line. Too many primary colors. It felt like they were on the set of a soap opera. At least it matches the acting of the principal characters.They tried to sew it all up with gory makeup effects, but set in the backdrop of a badly made film, it just makes the blood and gore goofy and laughable. The only way this film could be considered ""scary"" is with the cheap haunted-house ""BOO!"" scare tactics...like when a hand shoots out of the dark and grabs a shoulder.Why would they choose Mary Lambert to direct this film? She barely had any experience as a director before this gig and most of the experience she did have was with music videos. And, as expected, beyond this flop, she has barely done anything worth mentioning. Well, except for more music videos and the follow-up stinker sequel to this film.Let's hope the 2008 re-make is better.",Pet Sematary

I will give a 7 star rating.I tried to read the book once but i never got to finish it mostly because i forgot about it i guess. i would say that the graphic in it is not as good as Sleepwalkers though, yet another Stephen King film about creature like vampires that are afraid of cats who are also very strong creatures that can rip you apart.

Now that I am 24, this movie still manages to do that. The movie perfectly captured madness, sadness, loss in single moments. The back story and the myths in this movie are SO rich and enticing. The urban legends of the ground. The ghost that only Louis can see, looks horrifying. But is not the main antagonist.

This movie tries so hard to be a genuinely creepy movie and through out the movie, it delivers on that, yet I still feel let down by the end product. The first problem i have is the sound editing in the movie is really quite agitating, and I realize that is probably by design, but I have seen many amazing horror movies that do not rely on audio this jarring to put the viewer in a state of unrest. I mean I cringe every time I hear a phone ring or an alarm go off, a truck horn blare. Like I said, I see the intent of it, but the execution is flawed. The second problem is the overall tone of the movie which is inconsistent throughout. When Judd and Louis make the trip to the burial ground the first time, that is the tone I want to be present throughout the movie. Instead we get little sections that make it feel like the exorcist or chucky or poltergeist, it just bounces around too much. And I appreciate the music of the Rmaones, but their songs in the movie, again, do nothing for the tone and are actually so removed from the movie that when Pet Sematary began playing at the end of the film it felt completely removed from the rest of the film.",Pet Sematary

What made the film more ludicrous than anything was the fact that with all the historical knowlegde Jud had, why he didn't just let the family cat be buried in Pet Sematary itself and let it be. The child zombie wasn't frightening and the apparition of Rachel's sister had the resonance of a joke out of the 'Scary Movie' series. Laughable. I watched it alone, in the dark, at night for maximum effect. I slept like Gage would have before he was killed, like a baby. Apart from some impressively sinous and well shadowed nightmare scenes, the quality of the narrative and connections between the characters left me as unsettled as the ghost of Proscow.

This movie did not clearly represent how much death had taken place before Louis Creed went ""off of the deep end"" so to speak. I'm sure, for those of you that have read the book, will see what I am talking about. I suppose the cinema did not want a movie in theaters that was so long, with so many pointless details. Which is understandable. But. There were some things that were completely relevant and needed to create such a horror in cinemas.

His novels are masterpieces; his short stories are fully conceived and lovingly written with a healthy dash of the macabre. But he really should stop writing screenplays. This, having finally read the book, has to be the worst adaptation of any of his books. Not only is this movie NOT scary in the least (with the possible exception of possessed Gage), it fails to take advantage of any of the suspenseful parts of the book (i.e. the trip to the burial ground) and fails to develop any of the VERY well-drawn characters from the book. It's as though Stephen took the Cliffs notes to his own book and handed them to one of the most inept directors to make Hollywood cliché-riddled drivel with sub-par actors (with the exception of Herman Munster).

This neighbor can explain a supernatural risk that someone can take if they bury someone in the Pet Sematary. A strange and dangerous event can then take place just around the corner. This is what Stephen King's novel Pet Sematary is mostly about with cats being a big issue here. Directed by Mary Lambert, this 1989 adaptation of the 1983 novel is scarier than you think.This specific Stephen King story involves around Dr. Louis Creed (Dale Midkiff) who moves into a new house with his family. He has a wife named Rachel Creed (Denise Crosby), a daughter named Ellie Creed (Blaze Berdahl) and a son named Gage Creed (Miko Hughes). When they move, they learn about a new cemetery that is right around the corner. Their only neighbor named Jud Crandall (Fred Gwynne) explains to them about the cemetery, but there is more to the cemetery than it seems. When the family's cat dies and Gage dies horribly, they are both buried in Pet Sematary. However, they come back to life in bad way.Pet Sematary is very scary, but the story is written in a complex tone by Stephen King himself. He is known as the ""king of horror"" considering horror stories in his books. This story is well known to be written by him, but I was considering a less scarier movie from him. Pet Sematary is very scary considering its plot and characters. I'm also not a fan of scary movies, but I can still watch them. However, I look for the story of every movie and not the content. Considering the plot, I thought this movie was okay. It has a moving and complex story, but it is disturbing. I give credit to Mary Lambert for her direction to King's adaptation and to the cast for their performances. The R-rating to this movie is understandable.Pet Sematary has a good story to it, but it is disturbing. On that note, it's not my favorite. It's still an okay movie though. I give Pet Sematary a 7/10 for its good plot, performances, and direction. However, it just wasn't my favorite. It was pretty disturbing and very scary while having a stressful and depressing tone to it. I recommend it to scary movie lovers though.",Pet Sematary

276,norfaust,Compulsory viewing for ANY serious & devoted horror fan!!!,10,22 December 2000,"(Please note! This review may contain some SPOILERS!!!!!)This 1989 horror film directed by Mary Lambert is probably one of the best Stephen King adaptations so far (next to ""The shining""). The film makers have fully succeeded in bringing the literary work to life on screen, a task where many before them have failed. They have managed to capture the essence of the novel and translate it into images, every single one filled with emotional complexity. The result is a powerful, intense & highly atmospheric thrill-ride, a film that is both visually and emotionally perfect, a film that will leave no-one untouched. The credit for this must first and foremost go to director Mary Lambert, who handles the subject matter with steady and skillful hands. But, like with so many things in life, this is also a team-effort, and it is the combination of different elements, of different skilled individuals, that makes the film work as a whole. This is a prime example of a horror film where everything is perfectly timed; All the different elements, the well-written script by Stephen King, the stylish cinematography/camera work, the creepy music, the excellent special effects, the convincing direction, and the great performances, are perfectly balanced and strung together, and the result stands heads and shoulders above any of the pseudo wanna-be horror film c*** to have come out of Hollywood lately (yes, I´m talking about ""Scream"" and it´s numerous sequels and imitations, if you were wondering!).(Spoilers!) The film´s plot focuses on a family of four, the Creeds, who have just moved to a new house out in the seemingly idyllic countryside. The head of the family, Louis Creed, is a young doctor, probably in his early thirties, who is just about to start work as an M.D. in the local community (the family´s reason for moving I guess). The rest of the family consists of Louis´ wife Rachel, a woman haunted by memories from her childhood, and their two children Ellie and Gage. Unfortunately things start out real bad for the newcomers: Upon arriving at the house the young daughter falls from a swing and hurts herself and the young couple´s 3-4 year old son is almost run over by a truck. Later, one the first day of work, Louis is confronted with the casualty of a dreadful accident; A young man with his skull smashed in. The young man dies on the operating table but returns to haunt Louis in his dreams, warning him against some unknown threat (and thus foreshadowing events to come). Everything is somehow connected to a place out in the woods. You see, behind the Creed house there is a path leading do an old animal cemetery (hence the title), a place of sorrow and shattered childhood illusions....and, according to one of the characters in the film, ""...a place where the dead speak"". After the family´s cat, Church, has been run over by a car, Louis and the aging Judd Crandall, the neighbour, take it to an ancient Indian burial ground beyond the ""pet sematary"", a place rumoured to have supernatural powers. Of course, the dead cat returns from the grave, wrecking havoc. Everything goes straight to hell from here, and the rest of the film is a downwards spiral rarely seen even in a horror film. While the family are out on a picnic a moment of negligence results in the death of their son; He stumbles out onto the highly trafficked road that runs passed their house and is hit by a truck. Consumed with grief and guilt, Louis decides to bring his son back to life and he takes him to the ancient Indian graveyard for resurrection. But something has changed, and when the dead boy returns Louis suddenly realizes what the old man (Judd Crandall) meant when he said ""Sometimes dead is better"".This interesting, though admittedly not exceptionally original concept, serves as a framework for a number of religious and philosophical questions (which are raised more than once during the course of the film), among others ""What lies beyond death?"", ""Why do terrible things happen to seemingly innocent people?"" and ""Is there a God?"". The whole film is an illustration of our own mortality, or more correctly our reluctance & unwillingness to accept this mortality, and how everything in life is perishable. A film that intelligently and profoundly, not shallowly or superficially, explores & examines death and our understanding of it, our longing for immortality, and how death can strike suddenly and without warning, leaving a trail of destruction and personal holocaust in its wake. The overshadowing theme is doubtless the ""fear of death"" and the distance we create to it; Our refusal to accept death as an inescapable destiny, our refusal to accept and overcome the death of loved ones. But there are other important themes as well; The questioning and undermining of one´s personal faith (brought forth but the death of someone close to you and the hatred towards God for this act of cruelty inflicted upon the innocent), children as being more open to the supernatural than grown-ups, and children as evil (after all, they have not yet developed an understanding of life and death, nor a set of morals). In addition the film examines to what extent we live in & are ruled by the past, haunted by memories, consumed with grief over loved ones we have once lost, unable to carry on.All in all this is a personal favourite that rates way up there (on my top 10 list that is), second only to Romero´s ""Day of the dead"". A film that is both emotionally and intellectually challenging, a film that will keep you on the edge of the seat and leave you fully drained after it´s over, wishing the illusion would never end. A film that is nothing short of a horror classic. The performances, especially that of Miko Hughes as Gage, are incredible, and it´s amazing how realistically this child actor interacts with the adult actors. Even more amazing though is how the film makers have succeeded in taking a 4 year old kid, turning him into one of the most menacing and frightening figures in horror film history.To sum it all up: ""Pet sematary"" is a dark, pessimistic & frightening tale filled with splattery F/X, claustrophobic atmosphere and doomed protagonist. It is also one of the few films that really makes my skin crawl, and if you´re a horror fan, seeking it out is obligatory.9 1/2 out of 10 stars!!!",Pet Sematary
277,soitfades,Forget this garbage. Read the book!,3,7 September 2006,"Stephen King's Pet Sematary is not only a masterpiece of horror-literature but a masterpiece of literature itself. Not only scary, but deep, thought-provoking, touching and even very funny sometimes with pitch black humor (where you can see where movies like Ravenous (1999) have gotten their inspiration). If you're about to read one Kings book, be so sure it'll be this one. Everyone should read this wonderful book, even people who would't normally read horror.And this movie is one joke.It loses its point completely when leaving nearly all characterisation of Louis which was soul of the book. This movie is simply relying on all kinds of cheap scares with hollow characters. Zelda was a pretty nasty character and I was really scared when saw this film back in '80 as a kid, and still looking that thing makes me feel uneasy.

It's strengths lay in it's ability to build suspense. There are many excellent creepy sequences. The bonus is that some nice fluffy soft moments add to make a well rounded film. The movie would actually be nearly perfect, were it not for the often laughable, and overacted performances of Dale Midkiff and Denise Crosby as Louis and Rachel Creed. Whether this is a fault of direction is unknown; it does tend to detach the viewer from any emotional investment in the storyline. The best performance comes from Fred Gwynne (Herman Munster!) who steals the show with some of the most important and memorable lines. A quite young Miko Hughes also does an excellent job, and does not demonstrate the distracted child acting so often seen elsewhere. Some of the camera angles, mostly overhead views of the cemeteries, are both beautiful and creepy. Be sure to watch for one of Stephen King's famous Hitchcockian cameos.",Pet Sematary

The movie itself might not be a masterpiece BUT that is not the reason most people watch this movie. We want to watch a Horror movie to get creeped out and terrified, well this movie does just that.

Nowadays I´m kind of hooked to this film. I have to see this maybe once in a month, and on every new year´s eve I watch this with a 12-pack of beer & bunch of friends. It´s like an appetizer for a good party! I kinda agree to those people who said that the acting here is pretty unintense. Midkiff and Crosby do look like I wanted Louis and Rachel look like, but one can´t see very much devotion or feelings on the faces of these two. Hughes and Gwynne pretty much save the scenes which ""the Creeds"" underact. What I actually want to say about this is the fact that there really is no other film that has any kind of similarity to Pet Sematary, and I don´t mean the zombie stuff here. THE ATMOSPHERE OF THIS FILM IS CERTAINLY A NOVELTY AND ONE OF A KIND. Honestly, how many times you have seen a film which on superficial level looks like a cable-TV one, but leave you with a chill compared to only the best horror-chillers out there? Alright I busted some of the cast´s balls a minute ago, but I have to say that all pieces in that level too hone the overall acting to perfection. But hey tell me if you really know some film which is similar to Pet Sematary! I really would love to know...And I don´t mean night of the living dead here...this one is way beyond compare in intelligence compared to that stuff.",Pet Sematary
293,Rock-29,Most memorable horror movie ever!!!!,10,21 May 1999,"This movie was one of the scariest movies I have seen. One of the most spooky characters was Zelda. She gave me the creeps. I was about 14 when the movie came out, and I went to the movies 3 times to see it. This movie is a classic and still gives me the creeps today, I highly recommend this movie. Word of advice, don't bury your dead animals on an indian burial ground.",Pet Sematary
294,p-holland69,Pet Sematary,10,21 August 2006,"The film was as true to the book as could be. Apart from the goofs...which I watched the film again for to see them. The story was well represented. This was one of my favourite books and has become one of my favourite films. The acting was good enough for the time...classed with nowadays it might be classed as a bit cardboard but with the exclusions of special effects it was great. It is truly an icon of horror films. Sheer brilliance. Mary Lambert does a very good job in the directing of this film, the cast is superb and Gage is great. I would rate this film in my top 10 being high. I urge anyone who has not seen it to buy it, rather than rent, once you have seen it you'll want to keep it.",Pet Sematary
295,nuimipasa,The most awful movie I've ever seen,1,25 July 2020,It's one if not he worst movie ever. I can't even put in words how bad this movie really is. I prefer watching a white wall for 1.5 hours instead of watching this again.,Pet Sematary
296,peggy_harwell,"Jaba, the cat in Pet Sematary.",9,16 September 2006,"I would like to have a picture of ""Jaba"", the cat that was in Pet Sematary. He has also won several different awards.He probably is no longer alive.I Appreciate any help with this search.I read the book and saw the movie. I no longer remember in what order, but they both will raise the hairs on the back of your neck.The other Steven King movie that comes closest to being as spooky is the car that renews its self when driven or pushed in reverse. I can't recall the name of the movie. It is a girls name that begins with a ""C"". I also read the book.",Pet Sematary
297,claudiamachado,Wow!,10,14 May 2019,"Great movie, really creepy. Certainly one of the best 80's horror movies. And what to say about the soundtrack??? Its just really good. A classsic, for sure.",Pet Sematary
298,gibsonflip,Awesomely Frightening!,10,2 October 2007,"Personally, I absolutely love this movie and novel(I read the book first and decided to see the movie). First of all the plot is truly original and one of a kind. The acting is also great and i love the cast. Judd Crandall (plays Fred Gwynne) fits his role perfectly and really sells it to you. There are also a few corny lines thrown in there (Idk if they were meant to be corny), but they really will lighten up the mood and provide a good laugh. The Maine atmosphere is really a perfect spot to film this movie and it kind of draws you in throughout the movie. Not only will you love it but you'll want to see it again and again, I recommend this 100% to any horror fan!!",Pet Sematary
299,pkagalovsky,One of the Best (and scariest) movies ever made.,10,4 July 2008,"Probably the most disturbing thing about this movie is the fact that the child is trying to kill people. The end is a sort of a good ending with the stabbing covered up by the credits. Another thing which really bothered me was the sister with meningitis. The idea of a grave which could bring a being back to life is incredible and could have only be created by the warped mind of Stephen King. Such as how the cat gets run over by a truck and is buried in the Indian Burial ground and then reappears the next day but evil is an excellent idea that really makes you think, but when a person is put in the Indian Burial ground, now that's a whole different story and there is no end of what evil can be caused.",Pet Sematary
300,SippingJetstreams,"Horrible acting, some of the worst you'll see",3,2 October 2017,"The movie itself isn't bad. They do a decent enough job keeping close to the source material for an hour-and-a-half movie from an almost 400 page book. There are some glaring omissions, but overall it's fine. That being said, the only three good actors in this entire movie are Fred Gwynne (Jud), Andrew Hubasteak (Zelda) and 2 year old Miko Hughes (Gage). The two who played Louis and Rachel are atrocious, and that's bad considering the movie is based more around them than anyone else. Truly two of the worst lead actors in cinema history. People like to say stuff like Troll 2, Plan 9, The Room, Battlefield Earth, etc. have some horrendous acting, well look no further than Pet Semetary for acting that lives right up there with those movies.",Pet Sematary
301,WillySabba,The Best Horror Film,10,9 February 2003,"Pet Sematary is the best horror film I have ever seen. It's terrific. The first time I saw it I was only 9 years old, and I couldn't finished seeing it, because of the fear. But some years later I saw it complete and it's excellent. In my opinion Stephen King is the master of horror, so now I'm reading the book, which is excellent too.Pet Sematary is my favourite film. On the other hand, have you seen Pet Sematary II? It's really bad, and that's because the story hasn't been written by Stephen King.",Pet Sematary
302,Belloq1,Quite Good (Spoilers),7,28 July 2003,"I hadn't heard too many great things about this film. I'd always loved Kings work (books and movies) so I figured I'd check it out.This movie surprised me. It has some very very great atmosphere, the plot was unique and good, and it had it's elements of great horror. Gage's death is, from any parents standpoint, terrifying. Jud Crandall is the nice man with elements of creepiness. And the Indian backround is very eerie. The movies only downfall is the acting. It's overall good but it has its moments of (in search of a better word) badness. It has gore but nothing Evil Dead-ish. If you want a good little horror movie to sit down with some night (and get scared, which frankly I wasn't expecting to happen) then rent or buy this movie. A strong 7.5 to an 8. Great,surprising little horror movie.",Pet Sematary
303,TheTea,The best actor in this was Church the cat...,8,3 October 2019,"BUT, this is a favorite of mine when it comes to King. It follows the book more than i expected and i appreciate that, well because i love this story so much!
I love the rawness, the heartbreak, the grief and the mourning.. It's not an easy subject to tackle and I think it's done masterfully.
This adaptation was good. Well except the kind of bad acting throughout and some silly jumpscares.I suggest you go blind in this and it's gonna shock you and break your heart.
Recommend!",Pet Sematary
304,jossanten9,Roaring recognition for anyone who's traumatized by child decease,8,27 November 2012,"In spite of the fact that the story couldn't happen in reality, the smart core of the storyline is that it will horribly recall anyone's unforgettable memory of whom has lost a child in a car accident as a parent. Indeed, I suppose that most parents who have had this tragedy eternally suffer of a sense of guilt: they wonder how they could make it up to the deceased child, if the child would have a second life after death and most of all, how the parent ought have prevented leaving the reckless child alone just before the deadly collision. All these recognizable elements are probing merged in this paramount story about coping with all the fears, sorrow and despair that are humane consequences of one of the worst imaginable nightmares of any parent. Therefore, I would dissuade watching this impressive movie for any parent coping with a similar trauma, unless this is a way of inundating yourself with overcompensation for soothing the pain. Contrary to this appeal, this story is strongly recommended for any other adult who is fascinated by life after death of an early deceased child.",Pet Sematary
305,boelskifte,Not really an enjoyable movie to watch......but a very good one!,9,14 October 2005,"Pet Semetary is not the kind of movie you should watch with your gal on a first date, not even if you like her to grab your hand. This is not the average Hollywood horror movie, where laughs and scares are usually equally shared. There are very few things to laugh about in Pet Semetary, it's such a DARK movie! But then again, that's what makes it so excellent. From the very beginning - or at least early on in the movie - you sense the gloomy atmosphere and the dreary prospects lurking around the next corner. And as things move on you are not to be disappointed! Together with Misery and the Dark Half, Pet Sematary is one of the few successful King adaptations. I consider myself a hardcore horror fan, but this movie really scared the sh.. out of me from time to time. Afterwards you don't really look forward to watch it again.......cause you know that soon you'll get this feeling of hopelessness surrounding you! But of course you'll watch it again...and again and again. It's addictive and highly recommendable!!",Pet Sematary
306,Butterflykisses13,Pet Sematary . a good movie,9,26 January 2005,"As this happens to be one of most favorite novels , I was very excited to see the move. I was not disappointed! Yes of course there are a few things that I could pick on , but I think that the movie stuck true to the book, and was a really good movie. It seems that Stephen King films mostly get a bad review , but this is one of the good ones. It is such a dark story , which I guess is why I like it .. and what is better than the dead coming to life.. and something about animals returning from the grave is quite creepy too. If you have seen the movie do yourself a huge favor and now read the book!! It is a well written screen play , the actors could have done a better job ( I only say this for Rachel , and Ellie .. she was so whinny ) I liked everyone else a lot.. and most important to me .. it stuck true with the novel.",Pet Sematary
307,maria_135792003,i think that it was good,7,10 February 2005,when i saw the movie at first i thought that it was boring because nothing was happening but when all the scary things started to happen like when church dies and is brought back to life and also gage and his mom die and there idiot dad has to bring them back to life even though he nows the warnings and ignores Jud.this is not Steven kings best work. i thought that his best work was the shining. i don't think that people who see this movie and comment on how awful it was are wrong because all they think is that what were they thinking. as if that person can do a better job in making a horror flick. i mean making the gage evil and how he kills Jud is genius. making the most innocent most unsuspecting character into one of the killers is cool. people who didn't like the movie are dumb because all it is a scary movie and nothing all. don't expect something from a movie that it isn't. it still in a general area wasn't that good. i still recommend people to watch the movie,Pet Sematary
308,frey_p,At least it was free from the Library,3,20 December 2006,"At least it had a good amount Fred Gwynne in it.Dramatic irony and foreshadowing are a classic plot elements, but this film takes the cake. For example, ""That there road is a bit too close to these houses. Which road? That road? That one. That one? Yes that one. So? Pets, even kids been run plum over. Really? Really. Really? Yes really. That road? That road. In front of my house? In front of your house. Really? Really. Huh?"" I suppose if you want to see a fairy tale where the sweet toddler prince turned zombie killer gets the girl in the end, well then you should probably just skip this one and have yourself committed.If you want to catch Fred Gwynne in one of his last roles, and 'My Cousin Vinny' is checked out, well, I guess you might settle for this. Just keep the fast forward button within reach.",Pet Sematary
309,scarletscarlet190,After I saw it I left the light on for a week,10,20 August 2005,"Pet Sematary disturbs me ,in the scene where Gage is killed i have to look away, even after the tenth or so time of seeing it i still can't watch, and when Jud is looking for Gage, I look away and at the end when Louis' wife kills him, i'm not watching, I actually haven't seen most of this movie I only know its Pet Sematary when i look at the advert for it at the break.I still think its a pretty good film though, the actors are good, not great but those kids are so annoying, when Ellie keeps going on about Church, she should really understand hes going to die,your in a Stephen King film for crying out loud,I think this is a good film it sticks mostly to the book, it's no Carrie, but what is.",Pet Sematary
310,amorrisvideography,Good Screenplay/Bad Execution,4,1 March 2018,"The special effects were bad which isn't entirely surprising since it came out in '89. Like, of course when modern audiences see Victor Pascow disappear and reappear they laugh. But even the practical effects were pretty awful and just lazy. When Missy Dandridge hanged herself you can clearly see the suspension device attached to her shoulders underneath her shirt. Timmy Baterman is seen pulling at his undead flesh in a flashback scene when Jud is telling his story and no flesh comes off. Victor Pascow's makeup/the effect where it's supposed to look like his brain is sticking out wasn't done well and we see him for a lot of the film. The acting in this movie is just... bad. There are a lot of things that bothered me about this movie, but what bothers me most is that they chose a man to play Zelda. And his makeup was the laziest/most disappointing in the entire film. He was not creepy or scary despite trying to be. I don't think the script was awful but some of the lines in this film are just not things people say in real life. And the whole movie just feels so rushed. I think my last review got taken down for talking too much about the novel and the 2019 remake. So, all I'll say is this: If you saw this film without the context of the novel, it's utterly confusing. And I know I'm not supposed to talk about other reviews but I even saw one person who thought Louis was a veterinarian instead of a collegiate physician. With the context of the novel it makes much more sense but it is still executed poorly with an underwhelming cast, very poor effects both special and practical, and a runtime that could have been a bit longer.",Pet Sematary
311,TexasAir7033,Excellent movie. Not 100% accurate to the book but good nevertheless.,7,15 April 2006,Overall this movie was excellent for its time and will be interesting for many more generations to come. Although the plot is not 100% accurate to the book most everything is correct. The movie does skip far ahead and does miss some important parts. I found the book and ready and immediately wished that they had made a movie (because I hadn't found out about the movie yet) but later I found the movie in a bargain bin at Wal-Mart and decided to buy it and see if it was what I had expected. Overall I give this movies a 7 out of 10 for its good parts (relative accuracy and overall making sense) and for its bad parts (large time skips and small but noticeable inaccuracies).,Pet Sematary
312,jenna-95163,Disappointing,4,8 November 2020,"It's difficult to compare this to the novel since so much was changed, so it makes more sense to compare it to other film adaptations of King's. The Shining, IT, and The Stand were all quite good for the time and even hold up today. Being a miniseries, you get two to three films worth of in-depth backstory, character development, and world building. Pet Sematary did not get this treatment, and consequently feels very rushed and gutted compared to what might have been if this adaptation got the illustrious Stephen King miniseries treatment. Some really great scenes are absent, and some added scenes throw off the tone or change the story entirely. Even worse, some scenes are just unintentionally funny by comparison, and I really don't think that was the intention. It's not all bad, though, so it may be good for a single viewing, but if you've read the book first, get ready to be disappointed.",Pet Sematary
