0,MartinHafer,It starts off slowly but is worth your time.,7,16 October 2013,"""The Kings of Summer"" is a film you need to accept on its own terms. It's not a Hollywood production, it has a relatively low budget and it has a few plot problems. Sure, the characters might not be 100% believable or even really that likable--but, if you sit back and watch it with modest expectations, you'll find the good easily outweighs the bad.The film is about two disaffected teens. Both hate it at home and they want to get out...but how? When one comes up with an insane plan to move into the woods and build their own shack, the other, reluctantly comes along for the plan. There is a third--and that kid, Biaggio, is a real cipher. He's bizarre and in the film mostly for comic relief--though I found myself liking him the best of the three. But when he disappears, no one seems to notice...he's that sort of a kid. But the two main characters are initially happy and their running away seems to be working out well...at least for a time.Overall, this is a film that folks who only enjoy traditional movies will probably NOT like very much. As for me, I have a higher than normal tolerance for the unusual and found a lot of nice performances and moments in the film. Worth seeing and clever.",The Kings of Summer
1,SnoopyStyle,A couple of problems bothered me,6,3 June 2014,"Joe Toy (Nick Robinson) is constantly fighting with his father Frank (Nick Offerman). They're alone in the house after the death of the mother and the sister (Alison Brie) moved away. He fantasizes about his friend Kelly (Erin Moriarty) who already has an older boyfriend. He convinces his friend Patrick Keenan (Gabriel Basso) to spend the summer in the woods and build a house in an opening. The class weirdo Biaggio (Moises Arias) tags along.There is a good sweet 'Stand by Me' vibe going for the most part. A couple of things did bug me. First, the house looks way too good. Joe had already shown that he has no wood working skills with his awful birdhouse. It's more likely that they throw a couple of tarps over some boxes. There is no way that they could build a 2 storey house in the woods.Second, I thought Biaggio is way too weird. There is weird and then there is Biaggio weird. I like both Nick Robinson and Gabriel Basso. I don't know whether it's Moises Arias, or the writing, or the directing. I understand the approach the writer is attempting. However none of the quirkiness comes off as funny. A few got to be cute, but they were mostly awkward. I think it would have been better to have Biaggio mostly silent.I do like the two guys and the girl. There is a lovely little teen soap opera going on. The adults led by Nick Offerman provide some good stuff but not all the wacky stuff works. Overall, it's one of those youth coming of age movies with some charm but not all the jokes worked.",The Kings of Summer
2,kosmasp,Slow Burner (in the Woods),8,30 December 2013,"It's a coming of age story and it's as good as any other story that came out the last few years in that department. But it doesn't have that star power names behind it (or in front of the camera) as other movies have. The talent is still there, raw as it might be. The acting from the youth is really amazing, even if you don't agree of the actions some of them are taking.I watched this with a friend who was as happy to catch this at a cinema as I was. Really nice cinematography and great characterizations. A nice (if slow moving) story that does not change its pace. A drama that might not be for everyone, but for those with a quirky sense of humor and look at life, it's spot on",The Kings of Summer
3,george.schmidt,Funny and heartfelt indie gem with glimmers of Anderson whimsy & echoes of Hughes heart.,9,2 June 2013,"THE KINGS OF SUMMER (2013) *** Nick Robinson, Gabriel Basso, Moises Arias, Nick Offerman, Erin Moriarty, Megan Mullally, Marc Evan Jackson, Alison Brie, Eugene Cordero, Gillian Vigman, Mary Lynn Rajskub, Thomas Middleditch. Funny and heartfelt indie gem about a trio of adolescents so fed up with their families they embark to the local woods to set up a ramshackle home of their own and in the process learn some life lessons along the way. The three lads are fine as a comical group and Offerman's deadly dead-pan dad is a hoot.

4,FlashCallahan,Its a classic kidnapping....,8,22 May 2014,"Joes on the verge of adolescence, finds himself increasingly frustrated by his father Frank's attempts to manage his life. Declaring his freedom, he escapes to the woods with his best friend, Patrick, and strange hanger on Biaggio. He announces that they are going to build a house there, responsibility and parent free. Once their abode is finished, the three newly declared 'men' find themselves masters of their own destiny, alone in the woods.....Watching this movie takes you back to when you had summer holidays from school, you know the ones, we all had eight weeks off, and it seemed like forever, and the days were always warm.Its a long time since then, and the days don't feel so magical, so this is such a refreshing movie to watch. In anyone else's hands, this could have easily been turned into some hideous gross out movie featuring fart, vomit, and excrement jokes.But hey, once in a while, someone with common sense makes a film with a lot of heart, and while the film is laugh out loud funny, there are moments that remind you of when you first had your heart broke, or when you first really feared for your life.The performances are wonderful, and it has an air of euphoria to the whole movie, an almost oceanic feel, taking you right back to when you were the three main characters age, and at the same instant wondering if you will turn into their parents, as depicted.All in all, its a breath of fresh air, and if you yearn for your youth, be sure to see this.",The Kings of Summer
5,zetes,Very good,8,16 September 2013,"Very enjoyable coming-of-age flick. Nick Robinson, Gabriel Basso and Moises Arias play three teenagers in the summer after their freshman year of high school. Robinson and Basso, in particular, have become increasingly annoyed with their parents (Nick Offerman, in his best film role yet, plays Robinson's gruff, single father and Megan Mullally (Offerman's wife) and Marc Evan Jackson play Basso's ditzy parents). They decide to run away, build a house deep in the forest and live by themselves. The film is quirky in a funny (not annoying) way, and the first half of it is about the funniest thing I've seen all year. The second half is a bit more dramatic and probably more conventional: Erin Moriarty, a girl whom Robinson has a crush on, discovers the boys' plan and starts to hang out with them. She falls for Basso instead, upsetting the friendship. I kind of wish it had remained more comic, but it's still quite good. The performances here are ace. Offerman is probably the best. No, it's not an especially different role than his Ron Swanson from the sitcom Parks & Recreation, but he's given a lot of depth. The funniest sequence in the film has him arguing with deliveryman Kumail Nanjiani (a huge comic talent whose potential will surely someday be realized, most likely on a network sitcom) about the size of his restaurant's dumplings. Of the kids, Arias gets the most laughs as a goofy looking kid who is often mistaken for a psycho. Alison Brie, of Community and Mad Men fame, also appears as Robinson's older sister, but unfortunately she doesn't have much to do. The film is really well shot and directed. I especially loved the use of slow motion. This is a keeper.",The Kings of Summer
6,siderite,"A modern Tom Sawyer, but not as good",7,29 October 2015,"Two brother-like friends, upset with the way they live in their homes, with parents oblivious to their kid's needs and transformation into adulthood, decide to build a house in the woods and live there. Together with a really weird kid, they run away from home and move to this house they managed to build from scrap (and stolen) materials. Surviving on freedom, rain water and the occasional hunt (from the local supermarket).It is a coming of age story, with interesting and compelling characters, but in the end it just reeks of unfulfilled childhood fantasies. A kid who could barely build a bird-house manages to construct a two story structure that doesn't fall down on him, lives in the forest and doesn't get sick and, least believable of all, finds a place in the forest that no one goes to. So it is a fairy tale, but not a Peter Pan thing, where the kid doesn't want to grow up, quite the opposite: a kid that wants to be a man and thus does what a man should.To be frank, most of the film was boring, but the characters and the issues touched upon make this a solid movie. Biaggio's character was fun and pretty much stole the show from two mopey teens who shout manhood while buying food with the money stolen from their parents. Also, as a cautionary tale: never invite a girl in a boy's club, she will frack it up!Bottom line: Biaggio and the few inspired scenes at the end made me like this film. And I am referring to when the boy is washing his hands in a hospital bathroom and remembers the cool flow of a mountain stream. It shows that it was all worth it in order to build his character and give him his own unique perspective on life. Other than that, though, I was aching to press fast-forward in a lot of scenes.",The Kings of Summer
7,StevePulaski,A hunger for self-reliance in adolescents,9,4 October 2013,"I've mentioned before how I live by a rather deep, woodsy area. Gazing into it, at night or during the day, I can't help but reminisce about the fun my friends and I had, whether it be hunting for golf balls, due to the adjacent golf course, finding obscure ""treasures"" such as a beer bottle and potpourri likely left by homeless men or teenagers, and just spending a few hours constructing our own relaxing paradise.Why do I arbitrarily mention this in my review for The Kings of Summer? Because director Jordan Vogt-Roberts and writer Chris Galletta, through showcasing the brutal honesty of adolescence, the raging complexity of teenage hormones, and the reality of emotion have successfully hit a personal note with me I thought I'd share. A similar thing happened after seeing Jeff Nichols's Mud, a stupendous film that shows coming of age hardships along with helping a stranger to try and provide personal excitement in ones' life.The film follows Joe (Nick Robinson), Patrick (Gabriel Basso), and Biaggio (Moisés Arias), three youths who decide to abandon their cushy but stressful home lives for a more self-reliant, primitive life on their own. Joe lives with his father - the surly, sarcastic but funny Nick Offerman, and is still upset with the death of his mother. Patrick has two oppressive, babying parents who do not respect his personal choices nor his actions, regardless of what he does. Finally, there's Biaggio, a strange little soul who concocts this plan of living off the land away from civilization and parents.The three gather a bit of food from their own homes, run out in three woods, and construct a ramshackle house out of wood and trees in order to make a shelter. From that day forward, they pen and enact a constitution to abide by, eat, and live off the land. At first, they embrace the life they've pursued and constructed on their own, with no assistance of adults. One terrific scene that shows their excitement and their newly-created culture is through a song and dance performed with the assistance of thick sticks and a long, protruding sewer-pipe.However, as time goes on, they see their brave acts as failing ones and begin to give into temptation, such as eating food they did not hunt and kill themselves. Relationship drama that brewed during the end of school returns to bite them hard, and the fear of never being able to go home, along with the realization that they may have made a big mistake starts settling in. If there's one thing that Vogt-Roberts and Galletta need to be credited for, it's their ability to show the typical struggles of an American teenager, such as showing independence and personal capabilities in the face of nannying and sheltering.The Kings of Summer goes on for a briskly-paced and memorable ninety-four minutes, showing the highs and lows of the teenage life, along with the extreme anxiety that plagues kids of that age, as well. Numerous films come out each year focusing on the American teenager and few hit the nail on the head or even succeed as competent entertainment. This film articulates the hunger for self-reliance and independence in adolescent souls as well as their need for thrill better and more maturely than I have seen in the past.Starring: Nick Robinson, Gabriel Basso, Moisés Arias, and Nick Offerman. Directed by: Jordan Vogt-Roberts.",The Kings of Summer
8,KineticSeoul,Very watchable straight to DVD coming of age film,7,24 October 2013,"This one kind of reminded me of ""Moonrise Kingdom"", except not as retro/fairytale like and more comedic moments. When your young, you have this thoughts and ambitions to run away from home. Usually because of freedom, despite the fact that many youngsters in other countries are going through a lot more. But when your young, you usually take things for granted. What I enjoyed about this movie, is the awkward and abrasive comedic moments, that work as a whole. The interactions is not just believable for the most part but it's also entertaining. Despite the romance aspect of it, has been over done before. But that is just a small gripe. For a indie flick, this one is very watchable coming of age film. All the actors does a fine job, but the scene stealer has to be Moisés Arias, who plays the oddball in the group. His performance is weird but historical. Overall this is most definitely a watchable straight to DVD movie.7.8/10",The Kings of Summer
9,Hellmant,Not the best coming-of-age film but a good one.,8,13 August 2013,"'THE KINGS OF SUMMER': Four Stars (Out of Five) Yet another coming-of-age outcast kids film. This one revolves around three teenage boys who runaway into the wilderness to build a house and fend for themselves for the first time. The movie stars Nick Robinson, Gabriel Basso and Moises Arias as the three kids and co-stars Erin Moriarty, Alison Brie, Marc Evan Jackson, Mary Lynn Rajskub, Megan Mullally and Nick Offerman (who also just appeared in 'WE'RE THE MILLERS'). The film was directed by TV director (first time feature film director) Jordan Vogt-Roberts and written by first time film writer Chris Galletta. It's a touching and funny coming of age film, not quite as good as some of the recent crop (which are truly great films) but good nonetheless.The film tells the story of two teenage outcasts, Joe (Robinson) and Patrick (Basso), who hate their parents and are long time best friends. Joe has always been outgoing and adventurous and is constantly getting the more inhibited Patrick in trouble. When Joe gets fed up with his overbearing single father (Offerman) he convinces Patrick, who's also sick of his overprotective parents as well (Mullally and Jackson), to runaway in to the woods with him. Once they reach a clearing they plot to build a house and live off the land. They also bring along another outcast named Biaggio (Arias), who's even more of a strange misfit than they are. Joe's affection for a girl from school, Kelly (Moriarty), threatens to ruin the young men's newfound happiness though.What I like most about the movie is how beautifully filmed it is. The cinematography by Ross Riege is breathtaking, the score music by Ryan Miller and soundtrack are both perfectly fitting and Vogt-Roberts' directing is just really impressively done. The story is very touching at times and a good coming-of-age tale and the performances are all more than adequate as well but I found the humor of the film to feel a little too forced at times. Some of it is really funny but other parts are a little ridiculous and lacking much originality or cleverness. Offerman is funny but a little too mean, Mullally and Jackson are hilarious but Arias's character is just too unbelievable and strikes the wrong tone for the film (in my opinion, although his performance is great). The other two young leads are good but their characters aren't quite as relatable as some of the more recent films I've seen (they're a little too unlikeable and full of themselves, for my taste, but believable). Overall the movie is still very good, not the best coming-of-age film but a good one.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7f2S0g7yOKg",The Kings of Summer
10,Robert_duder,"Cute, funny, quirky...a worthy coming of age film",7,29 September 2013,"The Kings of Summer is exactly what you expect from it. To think anything more would be to have unreasonable expectations. Sometimes a movie fulfils exactly what you expect from it without exceeding them. The film absolutely has a Stand By Me feel to it but with a more modern twist. I feel like older teenagers and even adults will connect with the boys in this film and how they see their parents. Both sets of parents are obnoxious and overbearing but somehow I felt like perhaps we were seeing their flaws more so through the eyes of the boys so their personalities were personified. Still each character has their own flaws to overcome and obstacles to deal with. I think perhaps the only thing the film was missing was a lot more heart or emotion. I expected to feel something a little more but in the aspect it felt a little dry at times in particular with at least one of the performances. There was a fair bit of bad language making this mostly for much older teenagers or adults but anyone looking for a good solid drama with a distinctive style and art house quality will enjoy this.Nick Robinson, whom I know well from his stint on Melissa and Joey (don't ask), leads this cast very well. He actually is a character that does show emotion and makes the teen angst very believable. He has the perfect tone for the film and plays the comedy well against the drama. Gabriel Basso is his best friend and he is decent in the role. I didn't feel like their chemistry was terrific but it was okay. Basso was good but far from great and seem to be unsure of where to take his character in certain scenes. Moises Arias is probably the one that a lot of people will be quoting and talking about from the film. He is the awkward and socially inept Biaggio and he is very funny. His character stands out as being more over the top but he does it very well. I think they overplay his comedic moments but he does get some solid emotional scenes in the end which was good. I felt like Robinson's chemistry with Arias was better than with Basso. I know a lot of people really enjoy Nick Offerman as a comedian and I am not familiar with him but I thought he sort of missed the mark as Robinson's father who has a lot of personal issues going on. I thought he was too dry in the role and just lacked any personality at all which didn't help things. Megan Mullally and Marc Evan Jackson were perfectly ridiculous as Basso's parents. You would think it would be too much but somehow you will see something of your own parents in them. Their roles were small but appropriately used and I enjoyed them a lot. Erin Moriarity is the obligatory first love of Robinson's life. She is the object of his fascination and heart beating. She is good in the role and their chemistry good and it is an absolutely integral part of a coming of age story but I thought she was sadly underused.Director Jordan Vogt-Roberts hasn't got a lot of credits to his name and I hate to say it but his inexperience shows. A more talented director would have put a lot more heart into this story. Still for a new director he has some beautiful shots and a distinctive style that I enjoyed. He tells a solid story and while I thought the ending was a little cut and dry...it really was the inevitable ending. There wasn't much else for it do than what it did. First time film writer Chris Galletta crafts a good story, if not very stereotypical and the film is all around pretty safe. It doesn't push any boundaries and is mostly just a sweet coming of age story. It was good, not more and not less. 7/10",The Kings of Summer
11,MOscarbradley,"I loved every sweet, tender moment",8,7 January 2015,"Coming-of-age movies come in all shapes and sizes, most of them sentimental and almost all of them wistful. Some of them are about girls finding boys but most of them are about boys finding themselves, (and sometimes girls, as well). ""The Kings of Summer"" belongs very much to the latter category. It's gentle, lovely to look at and saves its dramas until the end; it also happens to be very funny.Here is a movie about teenage boys growing up that isn't primarily concerned with sex or violence but with building a house in the woods. It's been compared to ""Stand By Me"" but it's much looser. It's more like something David Gordon Green would have done early in his career but it's much tighter. It's also a little like Malick's ""The Tree of Life"" but without the angst and it's beautifully played, both by the boys, (Nick Robinson, Gabriel Basso, Moises Arias), and their parents, (including Megan Mullally). I loved every sweet, tender moment.",The Kings of Summer
12,cosmo_tiger,A must see for young teens & parents. The kid that plays Biaggio really steals the movie and is so much fun to watch.

The find a place in the middle of the woods and build their own house. The two of them along with a young boy who they are afraid to tell to go away start off on a experience that effects each one differently. This is an example of a movie where the trailer doesn't do the movie justice. This is an excellent and must see movie for all teenagers for a few reasons. One is because it shows that their parents aren't as bad as they seem compared to these. I could go on and on about this but the best way to describe this is a Stand By Me for a new generation. This is is movie that just needs to be seen rather then read about. Also the kid that plays Biaggio really steals the movie and is so much fun to watch. Overall, a must see for young teens and parents. I highly recommend. I easily give it an A.",The Kings of Summer

Maybe, its the wonderful music & BG score, but it does hit the right chord somewhere in your brain near the production house of dopamine.The Kings of Summer is all about cliché as it paces to the second half. Previously this year, Mud gave us something similar. At first, it resembled Chronicle (2012), but likewise it chiefly talks about friendship, solitude & familial situations sans sci-fi. I am baffled by the fresh writing and the quintessential performances. Talking about the latter, the actor who played Biaggio is terrific & has adorability quotient instilled into him. The other leads are marvelous, no doubt. Also, the supporting cast is strictly supportive & I wonder if there was an improvisation involved with the cast. I'm sure.In spite of glittery show & calm rendition, the plot slides into hackery eventually denting its own narration. But, it still entertained me for the whole of 90 minutes, depicting the wild, happiness from small things, romance & most of all camaraderie fun. 7.4 for this vibrant attempt at coming-of-age melodrama. Kudos!BOTTOM LINE: Recommended due to its highly magnetic music, performances & message. It sure showers relevance into its plot & that solely should be seen a driven force to devour this one.Can be watched with a typical Indian family?

15,Reno-Rangan,"A challenging resolution, but still love hurts!",7,2 June 2014,"An independent movie and a coming-of-age comedy-drama. The story of the three boys who left behind their respective lives for their freedom to choose what they want like an adult. They move to the woods and build a cabin. This resolution by teenagers leaves a greater panic in their parents. Everything in the world has an end and how long it lasts is the remains that concludes with a sharp strike that changes their rest of the lives.The story commences with a powerful tribal musical rhythm that makes us to have goosebump. Then takes us to the earlier story to reveal the meaning of their's behaviour. These kids performed awesomely especially the character Biaggio was impressive. Biaggio was the highlight, without him would have been a less interested in the story narration. The less preference given to the characters going to have a strong hold in the end of the story. So you no need to be wise to support any individual characters.The first half of the movie was excellent and then the later parts, it really breaks my heart. The romance was the responsible for that, I could not handle it well due to I was rooting for my favourite character in the story. I think that was a downfall, otherwise I would have said it's awesome movie than to say a good movie. Overall, one of the year's best movies and must not miss.",The Kings of Summer
16,eddie_baggins,A very nice debut film,6,9 September 2014,"For his first feature film up and coming director Vogt-Roberts has done a fine job at adapating Chris Galletta's Black Listed script that has such a unique tone it stops itself from becoming a truly affecting story even though it has many a scene that has more heart and humour than countless other ""growing-up"" up movies.The tone of The Kings of Summer is impossible to describe with characters such as Parks and Recreation's Nick Offerman's loner dad and one of the most random screen sidekicks since Pedro in Napolean Dynamite in the form of Arias's Biaggio having countless moments of pure unbridled looniness and the central story feeling almost like a fantasy tale of kids living in the woods in a house that has a slide inside it. These out there moments whilst being never less than amusing feel like they could of been toned down to allow the more affecting aspects of the story to take centre stage or at least have equal billing.Filled with unniversally strong performances from a young and talented cast in particular Robinson as lead Joe and Basso as his best friend Patrick, Kings of Summer has a relatable and believable story at it's core about learning to live and love your parents no matter who or what they are. Small moments in the film begin to explore this but are then dashed in favour of more fantastical scenes involving swords or hunting and gathering. Roberts does show a fine hand behind camera with the film featuring many a finely framed shot and one suspects that a classic tale is not out of his reach to direct.Kings of Summer stands out from the pack thanks to it's very original tone and is worthy of note due to hopefully the jumping off point of many careers in particular that of Robinson and Basso but by movies end you get that sinking feeling that although you have had a good time with this merry band of teens there was a more affecting way to tell this story that could of hit home for the teen in all of us.3 heated Monopoly games out of 5",The Kings of Summer

The idea is good (well, considering Western urban youngsters), young actors were distinct and pleasant (particularly Nick Robinson as Joe Toy and Moisés Arias as Biaggio), but the accomplishment is somewhat hectic, this-and-that porridge; the role of adults is vague as well and apart from Mary Lynn Rajskub as Captain Davis I found no catchy performances among them. At times, it was also difficult to distinguish dreams and reality, and the ending was hollow and trivial. True, there is lots of stuff to ponder on and over, including values and moral choices, but it seems to be a movie for parents rather than for teens.

This movie feels especially familiar to me, since I grew up near a rusty steel aqueduct pipe similar to the ones the boys here pass each time they go to and from the site of their fort in the woods (and even skied on top of it during one harrowing winter excursion). Naturally, what may start out as an idyllic escape from over-protective and under-attentive parents won't stay that way. The jock-type guy is going to steal the architect-like boy's ""girl"" as surely as the mosquitoes will start biting the most at dusk. This is the way of the world (since those footballers need an early start in the battle for their genetic material to continue on for a generation, prior to all those concussions and disfiguring injuries taking them beyond the point of no return).

It's hearty and funny, a great reminder of the unseen handcuff between independence and responsibility that floats into our lives at that age. The grown-ups are particularly hilarious as stiff, out-of-touch caricatures; everything we see them as during adolescence, rolled up and amplified by a few degrees. Moises Arias is the best of the young actors, playing a weird McLovin type who somehow falls into the partnership with two long-term buddies. His heavy gaze alone is usually enough to get me chuckling, and the cryptic, emotionally-detached lines that usually sprout from his lips moments later are absurdity at its best. It can get a little self-absorbed at times, and spirals off into navel-gazing in the third act, but for a good stretch in the middle it's prime coming-of-age goodness.",The Kings of Summer
21,estebangonzalez10,A coming of age film for our generation,8,17 September 2013,"""Why live when you can rule.""There have been several coming of age films that have been released over the years, but very few have actually stuck with me. The Kings of Summer is one of those few movies that appealed to me and had me emotionally involved with the characters. First time director Jordan Vogt- Roberts takes us through a range of emotions from nostalgic and heart breaking moments to laugh out loud buddy moments. It lives up to the standard of other great coming of age tales like Stand By Me. There is something about a group of young teens exploring the woods and their transition to adulthood that simply appeals to me. The scenery was also breathtaking and I absolutely fell in love with those woods. I could see what was so appealing for these kids and their need to feel independent. It does have that sort of familiar indie vibe to it, but thanks to some great performances the movie stands out above most of them. Moises Arias had me laughing throughout the entire movie playing this quirky character that reminded me a lot of Fogell in Superbad. His comedic timing was perfect and he had the funniest lines in the film. The screenplay by first timer Chris Galletta was also really well developed. I will be looking forward to his next work because his script made it easy to go through such different ranges of emotions. This film felt like a simple sweet feel good movie and it is one that I would recommend to my friends especially if they love the woods.Joe (Nick Robinson) has just finished his freshman year in High School and isn't looking forward to spending his Summer with his widowed father Frank (Neil Offerman) who makes his life miserable just because he's miserable. His best friend Patrick (Gabriel Basso) doesn't enjoy living with his parents any better. His parents (played by Marc Evan Jackson and Megan Mullally) are over protective and seem to want to manage every single detail of his life. Not wanting to spend their entire summers abiding by their parents rules the two kids decide to run away and build their own home in the nearby woods and survive in the wild by hunting and gathering food. This way they can be free to do what they want and make their own rules. Joe and Patrick also bring along a strange friend named Biaggio (Moises Arias). The three seem to be having the time of their lives without anyone telling them what to do and having guests over whenever they want to until a girl named Kelly (Erin Moriarty) gets in the way of their friendship and disrupts the balance of their kingdom.The Kings of Summer works thanks to some great performances from the trio of friends who bring a sense of nostalgia to the viewers' senses simply by playing and running around in the woods with swords and sticks. Those unscripted moments in which the kids simply goof around with one another are the best. Arias is really hilarious and he seems to steal every scene here. Robinson also gives a strange performance in the lead role. The film is easy going with likable characters and some wonderful cinematography. It is just great to look at and it completely surprised me at times with some of the turns the story took. It wasn't one of those predictable coming of age films and I really had a fun time. I wouldn't be surprised if The Kings of Summer ends up in many peoples' top 10 list at the end of the year because it is a crowd pleaser.",The Kings of Summer
22,Fluke_Skywalker,This 'Summer' is a bit hazy,6,19 November 2015,"There are few things more frustrating than almost, and The Kings Of Summer is an ""almost"" kind of movie. Despite a setup which asks us to sympathize with a pair of very self absorbed teens whose biggest problem is that - *gasp!* - their parents are annoying, it still manages to be a reasonably likable movie thanks to random fits of inspired quirkiness and a talented cast. But lost within its folds is a much, much better movie and that wasted potential ultimately serves to overshadow the entire thing.Despite this, and its ultimately muddled message, The Kings Of Summer has just enough worthwhile individual parts to recommend. -",The Kings of Summer

25,Amari-Sali,Each summer is filled with coming of age movies and this one tries to to take things a little less seriously,7,2 October 2013,"The movie stars Allison Brie, who we know from Mad Men as well as Community; Gabriel Basso, who you may know from The Big C; and Ron Swanson, whose real name is Nick Offerman. Also, Offerman's wife Megan Mullally, from Will and Grace, is in the film.Now, being that this is a coming-of-age film, the characters are mostly teens with the usual screwed up parents. To start off, we have Joe (played by Nick Robinson) who is our lead and, like all leads in coming- of-age tales, he has some issues. Starting off, his mom is dead and the man/dad he lives with, played by Nick Offerman, pretty much is a butt hole. He also has a sister, Heather, played by Allison Brie who does feel for him a bit, but isn't in a position to help him relocate. So, in order to cope, outside of randomly calling the cops sometimes on his dad, Joe hangs out with Patrick (played by Gabriel Basso) who seems like a nice everyday kid, with a never fully explained foot injury. Patrick's parents, played by Megan Mullally and Marc Evan Johnson, are of the overbearing sort. However, they are so corny that they seem like cut characters from Suburgatory. The last main character to mention is Moises Arias' character, who plays a typical weird foreign kid. It feels like a slightly different character from the one you may know him from on Hannah Montana, but at the same time he still plays a weird kid who seems to be playing up a stereotype for laughs. So, needless to say, this shouldn't be considered a breakout role.Focusing on the story, The Kings of Summer starts off like a run of the mill coming-of-age story. However, as the story goes on you get a sense that the movie isn't really trying to take itself too seriously. The reason I say that is because it relies on characters which don't try to beg for sympathy, like most coming of age films, and take the roles Offerman, Mullaly and Johnson play. Each of them play the parents and at times you are lead to believe they are more spoofing, or mocking, coming-of-age parents than trying to give a realistic performance. And this isn't to say the movie doesn't try to take on a serious tone, but even when it tries to make things a bit more serious by having Joe, Patrick and Arias' Biaggio leaving home and live in the woods, it never really leaves the silliness behind. For one, the parents don't really take the situation seriously since Offerman's character remains a bit of a douche, and Joe's parents pretty much act like ""gee wilikers are kid is gone."" Secondly, outside some teen drama dealing with a girl, there aren't many issues for the boys. Altogether, while the film avoids becoming pretensions or mimicking what we saw in The Way, Way Back or The Spectacular Now, it also avoids moving you or making you feel interested in the characters.But, in a way, the appeal of this movie is at least it tries to break the cycle. Most coming-of-age films try to be deep, dramatic and only tap on realistic comedic moments, which usually deal with being awkward, to lighten things up. For The Kings of Summer however, just take all the issues which seem to give weight to most films of this genre, and let that be handled by other films. Now, this isn't to say the characters don't have issues, but the film more so is about the act of rebelling than growing up and having a drastic life change be shown in an hour and a half.However, while you have to praise it for trying to be different, it at the same times sort of fails at it. While watching, you can see it tries to be a dramedy, but the jokes are more miss than hit and while characters are defined, you don't really get a sense that they develop. The Joe you meet in the beginning, after approximately 4 weeks, doesn't seem much different from the Joe we see at the end. Yeah, he has learned the value of friendship, both with best friend Patrick, Biaggio, and love interest Kelly (played by Erin Moriarty), but you don't really see him as evolving that much. At best, perhaps him and his father learn to deal with, and joke about, what aggravating qualities the other one has, but it doesn't feel like there is any real payoff. And it doesn't just go for Joe, but Patrick as well, if not more so. You don't see Patrick understand or appreciating his overbearing parents, he just basically gets tired of Joe's BS and then goes back to his parents like nothing happened. In many ways, as entertaining as the film is in some scenes, it is hurt due to it not being serious enough to be considered a drama, not being funny enough to be a comedy, and the film's attempt to balance both makes it look like an amateur on a tightrope swaying wildly.Overall: TV MovieUnfortunately, The Kings of Summer suffers from lack of character development and weakly trying to mix fantasy elements, like building a decent shanty house in a few days, with the usual coming of age drama in such a way which doesn't mesh well. Still, it has its moments where it is funny and when the characters are interesting, but as it tries to stand out in the coming of age drama genre, it doesn't set a positive precedent for other films which may try a lighter approach. So, overall, I can only recommend this as a movie you watch whenever it comes on TV.",The Kings of Summer
26,raulfaust,Different,6,26 January 2014,"""The Kings of Summer"" tells a story about a guy who doesn't feel home living with his father and two other guys that follow him on living in the woods. I personally asked myself several times if there's any possibility of living this way in nowadays' society; I didn't find an answer, but if that's possible, it's surely VERY HARD to do. For a moment, we can understand what goes in Joe's mind, since he has a rude dad who doesn't look like loving him anyways-- but maybe that's due to the fact Joe isn't any likable. But what bothers me the most, is that the story is TOO simple; there isn't anything surprising to make you feel like you've seen a good picture. It's just a regular plot with no highlights. The scene in which Kelly invites Joe's friend to ""have a walk"" is a little sad, given that most people have been in Joe's situation at least once in their lives. Also, it's interesting to notice how guys have the constant thought of ""I have to become a man"", which shows how society is chauvinist and how it presses us to act like a man. I mean, have you ever seen a teenage girl saying something like she has to act like a woman? I'm surely you haven't. The picture of a MAN still is probably the center of the universe, no matter how much people have been trying to change that. All in all, the movie is entertaining and watchable, but won't change your life in anyway.",The Kings of Summer
27,Sergeant_Tibbs,Little more focus and decisiveness on styles could've helped this one soar.,7,8 September 2013,"The coming-of-age subgenre is one well-trodden. But it's one that deserves to be constantly updated through the generations and moving technology though it's hard not to be repetitive. Fortunately, they can bend to any genre and any style which means there's always that perfect one you can connect to. Although I haven't seen it just yet, this year's The Way Way Back seems intended as mainstream nostalgia whereas The Kings of Summer is definitely in the contemporary indie vein though it seems to want it in all the styles and all the genres. It's ambitious to have a script that wants to be part comedy, part serious and part comic. But it never decides if it wants to be realistic or surrealistic and it really hurts the flow of the film. I quite liked its ideas on paper, however basic they were, but in execution, it falls short. It's not because it's without energy, in fact, it's full to the brim, but it's so overdone and forward that it hasn't earned it. Characters simply aren't well developed enough before the story kicks off.It seems quirky for the sake of quirky, serious for the sake of seriousness. It's like Moonrise Kingdom plus Into the Wild. While there's a realistic atmosphere, some of the aspects just aren't convincing, such as the core one of the kids building a house themselves. The severe factor that isn't convincing are the motivations. It's not enough. However, its emotion and comedy do work, but only in shards and that's due to the style. Nick Offerman is absolutely brilliant as the miserable father and he's the most consistent bright spark. Great to see him have more than a bit-role in a film. The photography is the highlight, perhaps the thing they thought about the most, almost like an instagrammed version of Mud, and it has some 'how did they do that?' shots. But I wish the editing didn't chop it up so much, the whole film feels like highlights rather than the whole story. The Kings of Summer is a mixed bag, but mostly enjoyable. A lot of focus and decisiveness could've helped it by the bucketful.7/10",The Kings of Summer

30,napierslogs,"Funny, amusing and takes just a few simple mis-steps on the way to adulthood",6,19 June 2013,"""The Kings of Summer"" is your average coming-of-age film for teenage boys. Boys act like men; fathers act like boys and by the end they all will shave. They just have to survive girls, the wild and snakes. Does it sound like the earlier indie hit of the year ""Mud""? That's because it's the same movie, just a little more comedic, simple and a little less revolutionary.Joe (Nick Robinson) hates his father (Nick Offerman) because he's an angry, sarcastic loser who offers rude comments more than advice. Patrick (Gabriel Basso) hates his parents (Megan Mullaly and Marc Evan Jackson) because they just don't understand his teenage angst. I really wish the parents were supposed to be how the boys viewed them rather than as they actually were because that would have been even funnier. As is, they were still the funniest parts of the movie.The boys were funny too, but not as naturally comedic. The dialogue was a little too witty for their ripe old age of 15 and the filmmakers had an unnerving tendency to make all their jokes non-sequitors. Early on Joe and Patrick meet Biaggio whose entire character description is that he's weird. He looks weird, he does weird stuff and he says weird things. I don't think the filmmakers trusted the abilities of their teenage actors. I don't blame them, but it's too bad because the result is around twenty montage scenes too many and everything is kept average, unoriginal and simple. I don't mean that as an entirely negative thing. Average films in genres which have built-in audiences guaranteed to connect with the main characters are good.

It's hearty and funny, a great reminder of the unseen handcuff between independence and responsibility that floats into our lives at that age. The grown-ups are particularly hilarious as stiff, out-of-touch caricatures; everything we see them as during adolescence, rolled up and amplified by a few degrees. Moises Arias is the best of the young actors, playing a weird McLovin type who somehow falls into the partnership with two long-term buddies. His heavy gaze alone is usually enough to get me chuckling, and the cryptic, emotionally-detached lines that usually sprout from his lips moments later are absurdity at its best. It can get a little self-absorbed at times, and spirals off into navel-gazing in the third act, but for a good stretch in the middle it's prime coming-of-age goodness.",The Kings of Summer

The story tells the tale of three teenage boys, fed up with their parents, who decide to runaway and build a house in the middle of the woods, living like men. It's a premise that sets up some truly funny moments, but they're not consistent, partly because, like many Independent films, the film never quite commits to being either a comedy or a drama. It takes itself very seriously, while still having broadly drawn, immediately comedic characters. Ultimately, it's a schizophrenic film that will entertain you if you don't shut yourself out, but this Indie aesthetic is starting to wear thin on me.

34,maccas-56367,Thank god for Pistachio,4,26 January 2019,"Without the little guy Biaggio (who I thought was called Pistachio throughout), I would've really hated this film. With his stickered new clothes and unique strangeness, he provided all the laughs. Everything else, just fell rather flat and surprisingly depressing.Nick Offerman was good as always playing the same character he does in every film. Unfortunately The Kings of Summer pales in comparison to The Way Way Back which came out around the same time in 2013.Nothing really happens - it's just a bunch of kids running away during summer and doing stupid 'boy stuff' in the woods. You might enjoy this if you're a kid longing to run away from home, or an adult trying to harness courage to escape a toxic situation. But I'm neither.The Kings of Summer reaches for greatness but never quite gets there, always squandering its potential. It drags a little, and is all too often filled with montages and dream sequences, as if turning into one long music video. Unnecessary divergences solely for comedic value fall short frequently.Occasionally familiar faces from various American comedies popped up to say hello. I enjoyed a few laughs. I tried to care about their angsty teenage problems, but at 29, I couldn't - it all just came across pathetic. They portray Monopoly arguments eerily realistic though and the kids even have their own version of Yoko Ono to wreak havoc.I don't understand all the rave reviews, but anyway, they built one bad-ass cubby house.",The Kings of Summer
35,Laakbaar,Light-hearted coming-of-age dramatic comedy,7,23 March 2014,"""Kings of Summer"" is a competently made, fairly entertaining coming-of-age movie about three suburban teenage boys who, annoyed by their families, run away from home to live in the woods for a while. They learn a few things about independence, friendship and themselves.This is a light-hearted drama with strong comedic aspects. I think the words ""kings"" and ""rule"" in the title and subtitle are overreaching and don't really adequately describe the strongly comedic side of this movie.I particularly enjoyed the performances of Nick Offerman (the boss from ""Parks & Recreation"") and Moises Arias. Nick Robinson and Gabriel Rosso played their roles well.Without going into the details, I thought some elements of this American movie were fluffy, predictable, unrealistic and Hollywoodish; however, this didn't ruin the film for me. These were healthy, attractive young people from prosperous American suburban families. It's difficult to see what their problems are exactly.As usual in movies of this kind, all the actors were too old for their parts.

36,TheSquiss,"Quirky, funny, wistful & damn near perfect!",10,17 October 2013,"""Why live when you can rule?"" The tagline gives little away but says everything about The Kings of Summer.I knew very little about Jordan Vogt-Roberts' feature debut other than what Mark Kermode had reported (and then revisited). I deliberately looked no further than the trailer and sought it out for myself.As Kermode and others have stated, The Kings of Summer owes a great deal to Stand By Me, Rob Reiner's sensitive adaptation of Stephen King's beautiful, coming of age novella. In common with the latter, The Kings of Summer has a small group of boys on their own journey of discovery through love, friendship and family angst. But there is so much more to it, and that isn't to criticize Stand By Me in any way. But if Reiner's film holds a place in your heart, take the plunge.Joe Troy (Nick Robinson) is closing in on adolescence and struggling with life under the glare of his cold, overbearing father, Frank (Nick Offerman), who himself is battling his own daemons and struggles to show affection. Joe finds a secluded clearing in the woods and persuades his best friend, Patrick (Gabriel Basso), to join him in his escape from their constrictive world, and there, joined by oddball Biaggio (Moises Arias) they build a 'house' and declare themselves masters of their own destinies.And that's pretty much it. The Kings of Summer isn't a film of epic discoveries, great mystery and explosions; the discoveries are about themselves, the mystery is life itself and the explosions are the fireworks of their own emotions. But you know what? The Kings of Summer is real, it is natural, it's beautiful and it's a near perfect film.Chris Galletta's debut screenplay flows easily; there are no self-conscious soliloquies but frequent silences where Vogt-Roberts allows the images to tell us everything we need to know. There is context, of course, but frequently scenes just happen. What we see are three boys escaping, running, leaping, drumming and being one with each other and their world without need for explanation but an innate understanding of each other's situations. Like Son of Rambow, we are guests in their world. It is a reminder, both joyful and painful, of all that we once enjoyed and endured and a contemplative look at what we could have achieved if only we'd had the balls to take matters into our own hands.The central trinity is a flawless blend of characteristics to which we can all identify. It could easily be just one body inhabited by three souls who meld or clash according to the situation. Like Stand By Me, the three principals give the impression of being life-long friends rather than actors cast for our entertainment. Theirs is a relationship that echoes with those of our own childhoods (and hopefully adult life, if we're fortunate) and it works so beautifully upon the screen because it feels natural and effortless. Often critics talk of 'chemistry' in terms of romantic leads but in The Kings of Summer it is a flawless harmony, even when they are sparring with one another.Robinson gives Nick a wistful willfulness that has us gunning for him. We want him to find his own way through this difficult childhood and achieve what we could not. There is a warm sincerity to his performance; his anger is entirely understandable and we want to be in his space in his time so that he can be our friend.Likewise, Basso brings our own reservations and fears to the party and it's impossible not to admire him but still want to shake him to loosen him up a little.Arias is in a different league, though. He is an absolute joy to watch and so much of the laughter is induced simply by his presence. His quirky, off-beat Biaggio is possibly the most delightful character to grace the screen this year so far. Arias blends Biaggio's idiosyncrasies masterfully, leaving us to wonder if he is there by design and fully aware or just bumbling along in his unique manner without plan or complete understanding.The Kings of Summer will be lost on those seeking movie stars and action but it is a gently funny, beautifully honed film that is almost certain to rank in my top ten for the year.

Its kind of amazing that Moises is doing pretty well for himself considering he had a supporting role on Hannah Montana a few years back. But they were all very funny and brought a sense of realism into the story. The adults were a bit more on the annoying side. I like that for purposes, they were pretty ""normal"". Though, I just didn't like the actors they chose. Especially Megan Mullally and Nick Offerman. They just had this really annoying way of delivering their lines. Maybe it was done on purpose, so we would side with the kids but I just felt it was annoying and not necessary. We all were teenagers at one point, and I'm sure we all felt like we knew everything and could take anything on. I think it would be pretty easy to relate to them, without having to make the parents come across as annoying. But like I said, that might have been just the actors and not the direction choice. Who knows. But then again, my other problem with the parents is that they didn't seem to devastated. We saw a little bit of it when the 2 dads went fishing, and later on with Nick Offerman on the couch. But, I just felt like they weren't sad enough. There was too much joking going on. That didn't seem real to me.But besides that one fault, I really liked the script. I thought it was very funny. Moises gets the majority of funny lines. But it was touching. I really felt for Joe (nick Robinson) when the girl he likes goes for his best friend. That whole shot was heartbreaking. I also loved the scenery and cinematography. Hell, it made me want to pick up the phone, call a few friends and plan a camping trip. It was so beautifully shot and made it seem very fun and lively. And, I thought the film was very well paced.

It talks about growing up and how it can be tough. But sadly, this film was a mess for me. At times, it tries to be a comedy, but feels kind of awkward. It almost comes across as a movie that could have been PG rated or even a kids movie, but throws in the F-bomb every now and then. The humour sometimes worked, because I had a few laughs, but it mostly came across as boring and stale. Other times the movie tries to be serious. There's a situation at the end that tries to be dramatic, but because of the weird tone of the film, I just don't feel it. It also includes moments that almost feel like it's trying to be an artsy independent film, or even a Terrence Malick film, because there's scenes where we see wildlife and people walking in fields. None of this works for me. The performances by the kids were... interesting. The two main kids are good, but the one weird Italian kid did not work. He was trying to be comedic relief but he was an unoriginal stupid character. Nick Offerman plays one of the characters fathers, and honestly, I don't completely understand his appeal. He always plays the sarcastic guy, and it sometimes works in other films and even this one, but it just doesn't allow you to connect to his character, which I feel the film wanted you to do.I really wanted this to be good, because it seemed interesting, but in the end it felt like a weird and cheesy kids movie that happens to have some swearing. I wouldn't recommend it. Maybe if I rewatched it another time, it might click, but I just didn't get that this time around.",The Kings of Summer

A third friend, that is not known very well by either of the boys, provides some comic relief, but otherwise, is not germane to the story. They discover in a short period of time that their fun without responsibility sours when a female is introduced into their serenity. The one who brought her into their private world expected to benefit from their relationship, however, the other guy was the true benefactor. This brings an end to their utopia. The somewhat unknown actors in the primary roles are supported by known TV personalities who support the story with humor that makes this unlikely story fun and worth watching.",The Kings of Summer

Nick Offerman, as Joe's dad, adds greatness to the film simply through his performance.The Kings Of Summer is not your typical teenage coming-of-age movie, there are equal parts comedy and Terrence Malick inspired dream-like obligatory art film montages, yet both play off extremely well.

47,cleary-joshua,"A superb indie comedy, with heartfelt performances and beautiful cinematography...",8,30 May 2014,"Once again, we return to the topic of growing up, and being on the verge of adulthood. A longing for rebellion and freedom is something which always comes up in these films, most notably in ""The Breakfast Club"", and that desire is something which every viewer above a certain age can relate to. ""The Kings of Summer"" shows us in an enduring and funny way how three teenagers try to become adults, with mixed results. It's a superb indie comedy, with heartfelt performances and beautiful cinematography.The film tells the story of Joe Toy, a teenager who is so fed up with his home life that he decides to build a house in the forest with some friends and run away from home. They set rules for the house, such as having to kill and cook their own food (a rule which is very quickly broken), and start off by simply enjoying their newfound freedom. It doesn't last long, however, as the teens very quickly fall out because of a girl who Joe likes, but who ends up beginning a relationship with his best friend Patrick. Eventually Joe ends up living in the forest alone, allowing his character to develop in a number of interesting ways.What makes ""The Kings of Summer"" so enjoyable is the extremely sharp and witty script, written by first-time writer Chris Galletta, and a set of absolutely superb performances. Nick Offerman is as funny and cutting as always, and the relationship which he builds with his rebelling son is very heartwarming. Even though it seems that Joe's dad, Frank, doesn't care for what he wants, the search which Frank undergoes to get him back is a clear symbol of that love, and Offerman shows this importance extremely well. However it is Nick Robinson, who plays Joe, who really stands out with his ability to mix comedy and heartfelt emotion. When Joe's heart is broken, we feel his pain and understand his following actions. The film's ending is so well managed that it tugs all of the necessary heartstrings.In ""The Kings of Summer"", Jordan Vogt-Roberts, with his first feature film, masterfully captures the emotions of growing up and pairs them with the beautiful forest landscape which the teens inhabit. In some ways, it is possible to compare this with another coming-of-age film from 2013, ""The Way Way Back"". Both deal with protagonists who are fed up with family life and find an escape, and both deal with the topic extremely well. It is a warm and constantly enjoyable indie film, which is worth watching if just to take you back to your youth.",The Kings of Summer
48,RileyOnFilm,Appealing to Adolescents,7,20 December 2016,"This is a fun little movie that made it under my radar a few years ago. If you enjoy high school dramadies, your likely to enjoy this. In one Summer, 3 boys discover a Lord of the Flies land in the wilderness by their home. Their escape their focus and isn't that what adolescent movies are all about? It's a common theme but the characterization and sometimes tense dramatic portions are original and effective.This high school aged comedy/drama starts where the high school campus ends. Here we have three teenaged friends, unhappy with their home lives, who join together to leave the suburbs and build their own shack in the woods.I think the angst of high school kids is pretty standard here. I remember wanting to move out of my parents house so badly at that age. I wasn't financially prepared to so I had to wait. These boys don't. They go through all the steps of building and preparing and their adventures along the way are quite engaging and heartwarming.They do some drinking and smoking and of course they try all the things they couldn't do back home. There are some interesting characters here as well. The main character's father is quite interesting. He gets angry and has an opportunity to reconnect. Does he take that opportunity? You'll have to see to find out. While comic in nature there are some serious scenes as well.There is a girl as there always will be. Her role is similar to the ""interloper"" in he Little Rascals fort. The drama and tension there becomes evident as the boys find out whether she belongs or not. I found the father drama along with the girl conflict quite easy to recall from childhood. I remembered these things that you go out and build a fort to discover. It's a good watch and I'd recommend it to anyone but mostly to fans of the high school dramedy.",The Kings of Summer

Who can live with goofy-over protecting parents? No one I know!!! This movie really made my day: the music, the acting, the crazy story. The elements are well mixed. The rhythm is excellent. And that cabin: I wanna build my own!!!! Can you believe the door of that house is a Johhny's door? And there comes the the missing element: The Feminine Touch. Kelly's entrance to the Toy's House was the beginning of the end. Joe get jealous of Patrick who is steal Kelly's heart and Joe wanted her for him.

50,RLTerry1,"A unique coming-of-age story in the vein of ""Stand By Me""",6,20 May 2016,"Return to that impressionable time in your life. However, unlike the more conventional coming of age stories, the subtext and themes of then first-time feature director Jordan Vogt-Roberts' film, written by Chris Valletta, are merely touched upon but seldom followed through in any meaningful way. The deadpan comedy and one-liners are simply tossed around instead of providing deeper meaning or introspect that may have increased the emotions felt throughout the movie. It's a very surface level movie that fails to substantially deliver the dynamic quality narrative that is typically expected of these films. That isn't to say that it is without merit; quite the contrary, it is enjoyable and is successful in taking you back to that time when you felt that no one understood you and you wanted to be treated like an adult, but still clung to the reckless freedom of hormonal youth. Understanding the consequences of one's behavior is a regularly visited theme in the movie. With gorgeous outdoor cinematography and relatable characters, The Kings of Summer contains a little something for everyone who has ever thought of running away and building a cabin in the woods for you and your buds.The Kings of Summer is about three teenagers Joe (Nick Robinson), Patrick (Gabriel Basso), and Biaggio (Moises Arias) who run away from their respective dysfunctional families and make a life for themselves out in the woods by building a house and living off the land. However, even this three-fold cord has struggles and disagreements, jealously and rage. The young men are forced to work through life's problems while dealing with the chemical and psychological changes of growing up.Have you ever just wanted to escape life? Just quit and run away to a tropical island or mountain valley? That is just what you will encounter in The Kings of Summer. Coming-of-age stories are usually some of the films that find their way onto favorite lists or those to which so many people can relate because they deal with issues many of us face while in that transitional time from teenager to adult. From lakeside high school parties to hormones and independence, this film includes some of the various turning points and learning opportunities one likely encounters while discovering who he or she are. Ordinarily, films such as this, deliver the content in such a way that it offers deeper meaning or emotional connections in the narrative. And although there are some themes and moderate introspect, the film does not go far enough in connecting the audience with the teenagers or adults in the movie. There were several lines of dialog that alluded to potential conflicts and personal struggles that could have been revisited to offer more substance in the film. That being said, the writer and director do provide relatable characters who are each very different from the other in an effort to provide audiences with a character to whom they can identify. It is important for coming-of-age movies to not only contain relatable characters but relatable situations as well. And this movie does that, just not to the extent it had the capacity to do.One of the interesting themes that can be read in The Kings of Summer is questioning one's sexual orientation. Much like in Wes Craven's A Nightmare on Elm Street 2, in which the protagonist's sexual orientation is questionable, you can find similar themes in this film. Throughout the movie, Joe is regularly making speeches on and offering up pithy comments about masculinity. Quite regularly, Joe lectures Patrick and Biaggio about what it means to me a man. At times, Joe even becomes defensive when his masculine ways are questioned. As Shakespeare penned, ""thou doth protest too loudly"" It is entirely possible that Joe is struggling to come to terms with his sexual preferences. This could explain why he would go to such drastic measures to escape his rigid father in order to discover who he is when he has to provide for himself. Other supporting evidence of this theme is simply the fact that he doesn't get the girl even though he tried much more than Patrick. When Patrick winds up with the girl, Joe is outraged and never quite gets over it. There are also the frequent trips to Boston Market instead of truly ""being a man"" and hunting for food. Maybe he's simply trying too hard to deny who he is developing to be? Perhaps. But, there are additionally also other themes that can be read in this unique coming-of-age story.Although this film did not receive the national attention in 2013 that it really should have, it is definitely one that is worth a watch if you enjoy this sub-genre of Drama. Ordinarily, ensemble casts can hinder effective character development and excellent storytelling, the cast in this film is handled moderately well. If there had been more focus on the personal struggles or if the film included an external goal, then it would have definitely been better and perhaps more popular. Stories in general–especially visual stories–require the principle characters to not only have internal goals, but a clearly defined external goal as well. Often the external goal can echo the internal one, but it is important to show a tangible goal. Unfortunately, the latter is lacking in the diegesis of The Kings of Summer. This movie won't likely ever have the nostalgia or cache of Stand By Me, but it does offer up a fun story with an excellent cast and some personal growth that will keep you entertained for the hour and a half runtime.",The Kings of Summer

54,joeywyss,A Surprising Delight,10,7 January 2014,"This is the kind of movie I wish made all the box office money, because it so successfully brought so many kinds of talent to the screen. The script was a delight because just when you felt it falling into familiar cliché territory, you are whip-lashed into a one liner like Biaggio's ""I said I don't know how to cry"".... I can't give any more of that without spoiling, but it stopped me cold, it was hilarious. The script is filled with those bon mots, as well as just about every single line that came out of Nick Offerman's mouth. His part was deadly comical. The scenes of when the boys are in the woods as the house comes up are fantastic in the production and photography, especially the 'drumming' scene which was fantastic. I was familiar with Arias and Robinson from their TV work and they shine here given room to stretch, but Basso holds his own also. The best thing about the movie is how it segues between funny and sad without telegraphing, and how dark and intense it gets when it was so light hearted just a moment before. Definitely a re-playable offering.",The Kings of Summer

I really just wanted to write and laugh at the ignorance of some of the professional critics online. Most of them ridicule this movie for its unrealism of a kid running away and into the woods. Hahaha. I had a blast doing this when I was around 10 years old. I mean seriously do these people not have a life when they were kids? Is this idea so far fetch that they can't imagine it can happen. Even so, is the imagination so limited that they can't fathom the idea. Well, no, it is none of these.

58,ercarvajal,"A film about nothing , not a comedy, barely a drama, almost tragedy!!!",1,25 March 2014,"I had to write something about this crap since it made me waste so much time trying to find something good in it.This film is not fun, it has some jokes and overly exaggerated stances from some actors to give a sense of humor, but for most part it is boring, slow paced, it has no ""spice"" in it.The whole ""coming-of-age"" genre is usually crappy, with people trying to deliver messages or promote agendas to mold youngsters the way they want; never letting stories to truly come out of a frame; you kind of know almost everything is going to happen from the beginning and this flick is exactly the same; and worst, for whatever little surprise ""part"" that you might expect at the end, it just ends numbly with nothing to add, nothing to say, especially no coherence with the main character's previous approach and personality.There is no message to deliver (at least not a meaningful one), parents are not the caricature expose in this horrible flick, (and if they are, I feel sorry for USA); teens are not that stupid either, so this film ambiguity between realism and parody is just awful. The film was so boring I spent half the time watching to clock to see if it was about to end; and I just want to see if at least at the end the people behind it would do something ""out of the box"", but nah!... It has one of the worst movie final sequences I have ever seen; I really hate the Climax and final untangling of this movie, IT DOESN'T WORTH YOUR TIME!!!! Well I would not see crap like Lord of Flies or Stand By Me; so if you're that type of people, go suit yourself, but if you found Stand by Me boring (just like I did); don't even try to start this one.",The Kings of Summer

But while growing up, the important thing is to learn with our mistakes. In ""The Kings of Summer"" there is a lot of stuff going on. Its a story about one boy (Joe) who is tired of living alone with his father and that wants to be free. One night, after a party that went wrong, he discovered a magnificent place where he thought he could start a new life so he persuaded his best friend and a guy he met at that party to built a house in the middle of the woods. This is a coming-of-age story that focuses on the feelings of this three teenagers. It is a story about young love and growing up. Moises Arias' character (Biaggio) brought a special touch to the film, adding to it great and funny moments. It's a movie that will give you enough reasons to smile and to be happy. Funny, smart and sweet, ""The Kings of Summer"" is another great movie of 2013!",The Kings of Summer
60,RTTerry,Decent but nothing special,6,29 June 2013,"Kings of Summer brought a smile to my face a few times, but I was expecting more and when I left the theater feeling as though it could have been much better.The first half of the movie was good. The setup was done well, the interaction with the families and friends was entertaining, but then once the boys moved into the forest, the film drags until everyone is reunited in the hospital.One of the issues with the film was buying into the notion that the boys managed to build the house depicted, in a matter of a week or two. The house should have been a shack at best, instead of a two story, multi-room structure, framed by 4x4 beams, partial sheet metal and plywood siding and roof, furniture inside and out, AND a slide staircase! No one is buying that. For as 'remote' a setting as this is supposed to be, we are expected to believe that these three kids somehow hand-carried several tons worth of metal and wood through a dense forest, not to mention furniture, and then threw it all together seemingly overnight? If it was intended to be something we could believe in, have the kids buy and set up a three room tent and then add a lean-to onto it–that I would have accepted. Once the guys moved in, the movie really had nowhere else to go and we are left waiting, and waiting, and waiting for something to happen, other than where the chickens come from and dancing next to a pipe. When the end finally rolls around, the visual display is more like a couple of bottle rockets popping off in the distance, instead of a grand 4th of July fireworks extravaganza.I also wish movies these days would give the audience a little more credit, and not make films expecting that we don't know much, or will pass over things without raising our eyebrows. Case in point is realism. I already touched on the aspects of the house being believable, but I have a few others. Can someone nudge a director and let them know that a little make-up can easily cover up pierced ear lobes on males! If you are going to show close-ups of males, and you don't want us buying that the character (Frank in this instance, played by Nick Offerman)wears earrings, then for crying out loud throw a little make-up on Nick's ear lobes so we don't see the holes! Studios go to lengths to hide all sorts of things on actors, like tan-lines of wedding rings and wristwatches, and to cover over tattoos, scars and hairlines, etc.–why not extend that to piercings? If you also want us accepting that the snake is a poisonous copperhead, then by all means pay a little extra and get a hot-snake (poisonous snake) handler on location and film a real copperhead–not a regular ol' bull snake (which is not poisonous)!The six stars I give this film are for the scenes with the parents of the boys, and the few minutes afforded to the romance trends between the teenagers, but the rest of it (second half) was too humdrum to hold my interest.",The Kings of Summer
61,e-pappalettera,If you loved Stand By Me This is for you. Moises Arias steals the show!!!,9,10 September 2013,"Three unhappy teenagers run away from the sophisticated city life and take refuge in nature, where they plan to build a makeshift home and live off the land, to finally be masters of their own destiny. Once you arrive at your destination, you make it reality, however, realize that the wild is much tougher as the imagined.Biaggio (Moises Arias), the very rare embodiment of social awkwardness and complete and total lack of personal sophistication teenager, that invokes a combination of amazement, bewilderment, and pity simultaneously from the common viewer. It's a role that cannot be explained...only watched. He is quite possibly one of the best comedic performances I have ever seen a young performer give. It's a wonderfully bizarre role that fully encompasses both the awkwardness and the sincerity of a social misfit.

This film is the latter. A poorly thought-out screenplay which is never sure about its characters and doesn't ever develop a point. These characters couldn't have been more under-developed, and amateur performance by leads doesn't help either. The visual style comes up without serving a purpose, and is distracting and shallow. The problem here is the writer and the director's manipulation. They artificially set situation for our ""adventurous"" teenage leads to angrily leave their homes, looking for an escape into nature. They treat these characters as derivatives of Christopher McCandless. How insulting for that great man! Before you even notice, this faux-self-discovery film turns into a teenage romantic melodrama that puts even the most idiotic rom-coms of Bollywood to shame. The film is under a delusion that it has earned its seriousness, that its characters have been on a self-discovering journey, profoundly changing their lives or perspectives. Nope. That isn't the case.P.S. An extra half star for using a ""Youth Lagoon"" song for end-credits. That guy deserves more recognition, but in better films.",The Kings of Summer

This film has a lot of heart put into it, which makes its characters more likable, interesting, and funny. The humor has this old-fashioned vibe to it, making this film great for adults (props to the soundtrack for some awesome retro-gaming like music) Now, do I think the humor stands out as much as the story? Not really, but that's not a bad thing. A comedy's story is usually very weak so that only makes this comedy stronger. Also, the likable cast also leads to some great humor. You want to see these kids succeed in building their own home in the forest and its very enjoyable to watch. A great cast (Moises Arias as an oddball weirdo was an awesomely funny choice), good humor, and a great heart is what a comedy should be made of.

They spend the summer bonding, learning, and regretting.I loved this very charming, very funny, and very thoughtful movie. The kids were amazing and three-dimensional, and the parents were as well. The boys who played the three leads were un-actory (if that's a word), and except for a couple of brief moments,you never caught them acting. Aside from the fact that this movie was filmed just moments from my home, and I recognized so many areas, it was beautifully shot and really well acted. The only thing that prevents me from giving it 5 stars is a climactic point that felt wrong (not giving away any spoilers). It changed the tone of the movie and felt like it was orchestrated by a studio committee to make it more of a ""summer movie"". If you saw Mud with Matthew McConaughey, it's exactly the same plot point, and felt exactly wrong in that film too. I don't like ""heartwarming"". Heartwarming feels sappy, trite, and contrived in so many movies, but in this one it felt real and organic.Kings of Summer is a really good, really small film and I'm recommending it to anyone who loves non-blockbuster, non-explosion, non-superfluous and gratuitously bloody summer movies.

66,eshaines,"Cute and Funny, But eh...",6,22 April 2014,"I give this film only six out of ten stars. While I feel it would typically be worthy of a seven at least, I found the film tended to only graze the surface of its potential plot and character development. I also thought it was highly over-acted by every character except Nick Offerman, who is, as usual, a highly reliable comic actor. ALL of the young characters, the so-called Kings of Summer, as well as the young girls who serve as the objects of the boys' affections, act with a pungent overabundance of constant wit and spunk, which as an end result makes their characters seem contrived. We don't need a clever line every other line, do we? And how old are these kids anyway, 35? They talk and act like it, instead of like the teenagers they actually appear to be. These are only a few of the factors that contribute to the unsatisfying nature of the film. On a positive note, the two main boys who fight with one another, then eventually make up, do a great job of conveying some sort of deep personal relationship between them, particularly when one abandons the other and the fort they have built, and when they finally re- acknowledge each others's presence in the hospital. Like I said, Nick Offerman was funny and most importantly, real, which helped offset some of the other characters' theatricality.Not a must-see, but interesting if you would like to see where new talent is headed these days, perhaps due to poor direction or poor skills, or both.",The Kings of Summer

It was a breath of fresh air, feel good at times certainly and also quite predictable, but if it's done well, as this was, then that shouldn't matter. Some great caricatures expertly played by an excellent cast, right down to the food delivery man put it way above what you might expect to be just another ""teen movie"". It is often likened to ""Stand by me"" but is really far more on a par with the British film Submarine, albeit lighter.Above all it was nicely quirky, which I guess is what most appealed to me.

69,iamjunandokensan,It's indeed kings of summer,7,17 September 2013,"I love the performances, screenplay, and the score. It's a coming-of-age so I could totally relate to it. Yes, sometimes parents could be really annoying but who cares, we, as teenagers have our own world and vision towards everything we see. Depression and insecurities also play huge parts in teenagers' life where most of them have committed suicide over something stupid. It's not easy being a teenager to be honest, you have this burden and pressure to better than the others, and you need to know what you wanna do in the future, if you choose the wrong direction, you're screwed.I haven't seen Nick Robinson in any of his films yet, but I can tell that he loves to act, his performance in this film was amazing, he succeed to convey the message of being a depressed teenager. Gabriel Basso, his performance was alright but not as good as in super 8. Moises Arias, I really love his performance, he's so much fun to watch.

70,blakkdog,Fun Quirky Funny but Not Sure What it Is and We Don't Learn Anything Really,7,3 February 2015,"Enjoyed it for what it was which was a standard coming of age film wrapped in a quirky vehicle for comedic ad libbing by the likes of Nick Offerman, Megan Mullally, Eugene Cordero, etc. who do a fantastic and hysterical job (although I did find Offerman's character to be a little too much of an angry ass to allow myself to completely appreciate the clear humorous one liners in his seething bitter attitude toward everything). But the movie is a strange mix. Its both a platform for this kind of free form comedic prowess by some talented comedians and a standard coming of age drama (yes very much a drama in a teen sense) for the main teenage characters who kind of exist in their own little teen soap opera bubble within the body of the film. So you are forced to follow along with the main story of the teens finding themselves, working out their relationships with each other and figuring out whats important in life in very tender and often dramatic ways while this kind of alternative parallel universe whirls around them that's very often funny and almost always distracting and hard to weave in with the main story. It was just a weird mix for me. I guess the film makers were trying to present their worlds in a way that allows us to see how they see it and so they present their parents and the police and society at large as farcical, ludicrous, and almost surreal so we can relate to their plight more. Maybe? So you end up with a world where you have no 'straight man' adults but rather a bunch of bizarre and/or clownish characters that are thoroughly entertaining (the cops are great and the scene where Mullally is going off on them about the Irish being the 'blacks of Europe' was hysterical). There's something to that approach that I appreciate but I found that I wasn't able to stir the weird oil/water mixture of comedic muscle-flexing by some very talented comedians with a teen soap opera by teen actors who don't/cant follow that pattern at all. Oh but with one exception Dear wonderful BiaggioBiaggio is my favorite character in this movie and the best character I've seen in a movie in I don't know how many years and thank god for him. I would have appreciated this movie much less without his completely alien bizarre wackiness to balance the other kids (especially Joe) and keep it from becoming some kind of terrible ""90210 in the woods"" teen garbage puke with no soul and no magic. At first he just seems like a silly annoying throw away weirdo character not worth investing in (which is exactly what the main characters think of him) but as he develops and becomes one of the main characters you embrace him completely just as they do until you are hanging on his every word and action waiting for him to floor you with some other truly wonderful quirky comment or weird look. I couldn't get enough of Biaggio. I would pay money to see a movie where Biaggio is the main character despite the fact that I would know going in that movie would surely suck because he cant be the focus of a story without completely altering his role. But I would go anywayHowever, I digress I enjoyed the movie but in the end I found it lacking a real message. Is it about the parents (and therefore the world) coming around to understand how their kids think so they can relate to them better and not be lunatics like they were before and not try to control them so much? Because losing them made them realize how much they need them around and that their kids are capable of living independently and surviving? Im not sure that works. Is it that teen relationship drama isn't that important in the end and buds are buds? I didn't think they presented the resolution between Joe and Patrick well. And to try to have Kelly be the mediator when she was the cause of the whole thing didn't work for me. That scene where they flip each other off from their cars then both smile is that supposed to smooth everything and make everything better? Is that supposed to be a resolution or are they just saying The resolution is No resolution? Maybe that's a little too indie for me I feel like Patrick was an ass and that Joe was enormously over reactive and angry in his response (like his father?) and I found myself losing some respect for both characters because of the way that conflict unfolded. But I have a feeling someone will say Im not getting it and Im probably not.A few plot inconsistencies bothered me too. Patrick goes home and they don't grill him about where Joe is? What?? Also, for the love of god if you are going to have a scene where someone gets dramatically bitten by a ""poisonous"" snake make sure that snake at least looks like a copper head or a rattle snake or something and not CLEARLY AND OBVIOUSLY like a gopher or a garter snake! Oh my god that was terrible What is this a middle school play where someone shakes a rope and we just assume it's a snake?But overall worth watching despite being somewhat uncategorizable (which is certainly no crime if you can pull it off). Its heart is a drama but its body is a comedy. Yet its not a dramedy. In essence this is a teen drama with a comedy oozing all over it (flowing around it?). Not sure if that works necessarily but it was a fun attempt to watch.",The Kings of Summer
71,aka-valkra,"A slow paced (in a good way), relaxing, realistic movie",7,12 May 2014,"The acting from almost every character was very good, despite none of the actors are very well known with the exception of Alison Brie. The interactions between characters, especially Joe and his father felt very real and not over done. Even the ending where Joe reunites with his father was very real and not over dramatic. This made for a very convincing movie about the experiences of teenagers and their want of freedom. Almost all teens can relate to this movie as it portrays something that we all want, freedom from our parents. Would not say this is a feel good movie except the ending due to all the drama but it was a chill movie to watch on a quiet Sunday afternoon. Would recommend to all teenagers who appreciate slower movies that have a good story, rather than action. Adults may appreciate this movie too and might learn something about parenting from watching Joe and Patrick's parents. Overall an enjoyable movie.",The Kings of Summer
72,tsangaridesi,"Good idea, but not executed well enough.",7,6 September 2014,"I had heard a couple of opinions on this movie, and they were both very positive, so I naturally assumed this movie was going to a great low- budget movie. Well, while it wasn't great, merely alright, it was disappointing. My first impression was that two of the three teenage protagonists were brats. The movie gradually works into wanting you to have empathy for the characters, but I couldn't be as empathic as the story had potential for me to be, seeing as the reason the characters moved out into the woods was completely stupid, or at least it seems so from the examples of their parent's behaviors on screen. Apart from that, I found this movie to be more than a tad bit sexist, especially in the daydream scene. There is no reason for the ""becoming a man"" references, and that indirectly added to the sexist aspect I was referring to. I found it to be plainly silly. The acting is good, but then again, the roles weren't exactly demanding. The movie is a comedy, but it's not really that funny. There were a few jokes which actually made me laugh out loud, but, for me, around 65% of the material was just thrown in there because the writers felt like there weren't enough jokes. Although, the effort on everyone's part is admirable, and that's partially why I can appreciate this movie.",The Kings of Summer
73,FreakNumberOne,Budget and talent but no ideas,5,2 January 2014,"Never trust a movie with more than two intro sequences, it's a sign of desperation.This movie has many of the elements of a good film, but can't decide how to assemble them. The supporting talent is excellent, but the leads are so so. Photography is competent and attractive, but would be more at home in a commercial or a music video than a coming of age comedy. Though out of place photography is just a symptom of the film's overall uneven tone.At times a contemplative artistic study, at others a screwball comedy, the one tone keeps the other from sticking. The film's identity crisis at times makes it seem like it's 30% filler material. One completely out of place scene cuts from the standard narrative perspective to a fantasy sequence of a girl blowing up a truck and then back. Are we suddenly seeing, the protagonist, Joe's thoughts? Is that a part of this film's style now? Don't worry, it's the one and only time it'll ever happen.And then there's dramatic investment. Should I have been worried when Joe was alone in the woods? When he's a 6 minute walk from a road and a Boston Market? Personally I didn't believe for a moment that these kids could have built that house, scavenged the materials, had the patience or skill to assemble it, or that they ever would have stayed in it for more than 2 nights. The premise, that they would live there for good, was never believable even for a moment; at most a month, or until it became uncomfortable. Where is the peril? Where is the risk?It's very clear after the first thirty minutes that the film had completely run out of ideas. We see long sequences of pretty DSLR footage inter-cut with a couple days of the cast and crew messing around with an expensive slow motion camera. By the final sequence in the hospital I was begging this film to end. We had been four steps ahead of it since the second introductory sequence and by the third we had lapped it.The movie is made watchable by Funny Or Die veterans Nick Offerman, Megan Mullally and Kumail Nanjiani, as well as by a show stealing performance by Moises Arias, though we never really know who his character is. He remains two-dimensional throughout, a sitcom style ""breakout"" character whose every action represents the writer directly asking the audience 'isn't this guy wacky?'. Not to give anything away, but in the movie's finale the main character seems to claim that he knows about a certain subject, but then does all the worst things that he could possibly do while dealing with that subject. Ten minutes on Wikipedia could have shown the filmmakers what he should have done in the situation. It's sort of baffling, and adds to a particular tone that this film already dripped with; that is was made by entitled, insulated film students seeking artistic approval.I wish them all luck in their future endeavors. I hope all of their next projects suit their personal styles a bit better.",The Kings of Summer
74,Christof_McShine,A Film Filled with Heart and Humour,7,15 September 2013,"This was a film which had a blink and you'll miss it approach when being released in the U.K so I'm delighted to have finally caught up with it. The premise, teenage boys on the brink of manhood enjoying a summer adventure together may sound like it's lifted straight from the pages of Stand By Me but this is something altogether different. Joe and Patrick are lifelong friends and both are fed up with the thought of spending another dreary summer in the company of their parents. For Joe his father appears to be completely disconnected from him whilst Patrick's parents are in the Stepford mould, blissfully unaware of the trials and tribulations a teenage boy faces. Together the boys decide to decamp to the wild forests for the summer, escaping all their worries whilst getting back to nature. Joined by weirdo kid Biaggio they are soon designing and building a new home and learning of the joys in the wilderness whilst parents and police search for them. It's a film which could've been little more than a generic coming of age tale but this one is lifted beyond that thanks in large part to some wonderful performances. Nick Robinson and Gabriel Basso shine as our two teenage heroes, Robinson in particular showing real depth as things begin to take an inevitable turn from harmony and happiness to pain and loneliness as a girl threatens to destabilise it all. They are supported by a quite brilliant performance from Nick Offerman as Joe's dad, every line of his dialogue is genuinely laugh out loud as he dispels acerbic sarcasm to those around him. Huge credit also to Ross Riege for a gorgeously shot film, he maximises the beauty of the natural surroundings throughout. The film is by no means perfect - the incompetence of the police and lack of any real concern from parents doesn't fit well and Biaggio's bizarre character grates after a while. These faults aside this is a genuinely warm, funny and utterly charming film with real heart.",The Kings of Summer
75,sneakysnacks,A perfect film in my mind,10,17 October 2013,"I love coming of age movies and I love to laugh. In my 17 years I have never seen a movie that has appealed to me so entirely. You can't go into this expecting anything too serious, I think that is the issue that most negative reviewers had. While there are some significant themes here, Kings of Summer is not The Shawshank Redemption. This is not because it fails as a movie, but because it does not try to be anything more than what it is. This is a film that is meant to be a humorous look into the lives of a couple of teenagers. I think there is a tendency among many ""movie-nuts"" to believe that the only good movies are those that depress you or involve some very dark themes. I guess what I am saying is to go in with an open mind, and just enjoy yourself. Anyone who doesn't feel a bit better leaving this movie than when entering it is obviously trying too hard to be critical. Let go, have a laugh, join the three Kings of Summer.",The Kings of Summer

This movie has great directing, good acting, but the beautiful scenery steals the show. I loved the constant switches in between scenes. The movie also has some genuinely funny moments, topped of by a serious ending. It's themes and lessons are by no means unique, but the movie has this authentic quality to it that manages to make this one stand out. I might even watch this movie again sometime. I have to mention the most memorable scene. It's sort of a ritual-like dancing scene, there's something oddly special there. That's a scene worth re-watching multiple times.",The Kings of Summer
77,john-3048,Potentially decent movie ruined by ill-defined relationships,5,31 March 2020,"What could have been an excellent coming of age film was ruined by a screenplay that didn't adequately define central relationships, mostly regarding the mandatory ""love interest.""Was Joe's relationship with Kelly a long standing childhood friendship and/or an awkward romantic fantasy? Was Kelly a sweet caring friend and/or a flirtatious tease who always went for bad boys and dumb jocks (supposedly at 15)? Was Patrick so shallow that he was willing to throw away a lifelong friendship for a hot girl? Was Joe so shallow that he would readily forgive his best friend for despoiling his idyllic vision?The worst line ever written for a screenplay has to have been Kelly's lame explanation to Joe at the hospital that, ""just because I'm not dating you, doesn't mean I don't care about you."" And this after Joe had thrown himself in front of her as a sacrifice to the deadly snake? For that he gets a crappy card?The film had such potential, if only the screenwriter and director had more clearly developed the Joe/Patrick/Kelly relationships, and possibly Joe/Heather, to make the supposed Joe/Frank reconciliation more believable. It's so frustrating when a movie seems to just run out of time and quit, especially those that have filled the reels with so many extraneous diversions.",The Kings of Summer

Joe Toy and his friend Patrick get fed up with their parents and decide to build a house in the woods to live in.I really enjoyed this movie. It seemed to have the right mix of comedy and drama to keep you engaged the whole movie. Watching a couple of teenage boys try and survive in the woods was a lot of fun, and Nick Offerman as Joe's dad was a lot of fun as well. The biggest thing to note, is that while this is billed as a comedy, it was definitely more than that. The emotional aspect of this movie was everything you come to expect from a movie that has to sale itself with a great story, like most films at Sundance, which made it all that more fun.",The Kings of Summer
80,zeusandtomshow,Not so clever,5,1 January 2014,"Pretentious, bad-acting filled movie. Premise of 3 teens running away from home to live in the woods. There are a couple of genuine laughs, but not enough to warrant the classification of comedy. Bright spots are Nick Offerman playing Frank, one of the fathers, and Erin Moriarty playing, Kelly, a school friend. Character of Biaggio starts out interesting, but develops into a caricature of himself. The trio's attempt to escape the adolescent rat race backfires when drama creeps into their woodly abode. The plot plods along as fast as teenagers mature. Nice try, but can't recommend it. Save yourself the time and go watch Stand By Me instead.",The Kings of Summer
81,chris-cline-405-10381,"""A pleasant throwback to the coming-of-age & slice-of-life genre...""",8,21 August 2013,"The American cinema has been dominated for many years by the beast that is the ""action blockbuster"". In a year that has been dominated by action flicks like ""Jack The Giant Killer"", ""Oz, The Great and Powerful"", ""G.I. Joe: Retaliation"", ""Olympus Has Fallen"", and not to mention ""A Good Day To Die Hard"", a simple coming-of-age comedy is easily overlooked by the common movie goer. But as always, there are exceptions every now and then where a small- time independent film with a good story, good cast, and a good marketing strategy seeps through the cracks in the foundation of cinema society and becomes a target of interest. Some notable examples of these ""independent gems"" of the 21st century would include: ""My Big Fat Greek Wedding"", ""Juno"", ""March Of The Penguins"", and...still much to my surprise...""Napoleon Dynamite"". As such, I have tremendous confidence that ""The Kings Of Summer"" will achieve some level of notoriety for it's effort in capturing a very welcome offbeat and whimsical interpretation of the coming-of-age and slice-of-life film genre.The story focuses around three young boys who have just finished their first year of high school and are unfortunately finding the first few days of summer to be a less than welcome reprieve. Our three misfit teenage protagonists are Joe Toy (Nick Robinson), the out-of-touch teen who struggles to find peace of mind with his less than affectionate widowed father Frank Toy (Nick Offerman). Patrick Keenan (Gabriel Basso), the awkward silent type with the overly involved parents (Mark Evan Jackson & Megan Mullally), who struggles with finding independence and personal freedom under the clouds of parental control. And finally, Biaggio (Moises Arias), the very rare embodiment of social awkwardness and complete and total lack of personal sophistication teenager, that invokes a combination of amazement, bewilderment, and pity simultaneously from the common viewer. It's a role that cannot be explained...only watched.As these three boys grow emotionally exhausted with there seemingly pointless lives, Joe Toy hatches the idea of leaving their old lives behind and building a house from scratch in the unexplored wilderness of Ohio. Together, the three of them run away from home, determined that they can live off the land without parental control breathing down their necks and quickly erect a make-shift house of their own from forest growth, and abandoned (and stolen) construction materials. While the thrill and excitement of their accomplishments fuels them for a time, after a couple of weeks in the forest on their own they quickly realize that the responsibilities that come with adulthood aren't exactly the joys they had hoped for.While the plot is relatively simple on paper I have yet to see a film where it unfolds in such charming originality as it does here. It's a ""gawky"" and ""cutesy"" storytelling style that relies on it's own social awkwardness to bring out the genuinely funny moments and the dramatic transformation of our heroes in question. It can be classified in my book as both an ""experimental indie-film"", and a potential modern day ""classic"". But either way, it's an all around fun film! While there is the occasional editing goofs and mishaps that come with indie-films the cinematography is quite good and really captures the forested landscape with a poignant artistic fashion.But ultimately, this story is nothing without the characters! The story would not be nearly as memorable if it wasn't for the talented cast of actors that fully drive the plot of this story. Robinson and Basso are right at home in their roles and the friendship between them is very well written and performed. I rarely felt that the acting was forced or overdone. Offerman, Mullaly, and Jackson also give stellar performances as the parents, bringing the typical comedic talents they have been known for in their previous works on screen. But Arias as ""Biaggio"" is quite possibly one of the best comedic performances I have ever seen a young performer give. It's a wonderfully bizarre role that fully encompasses both the awkwardness and the sincerity of a social misfit. The role is so over-the-top that it's amazing that Arias can make it look so natural and genuine.Ultimately, it's a film worth seeing by a mainstream audience and I'm hopeful that CBS Films will be successful in achieving this goal. It's done very well on the independent circuit so far, and it's national opening is currently June 7, 2013. Director Jordan Vogt-Roberts is relatively new to directing and film-making, but this is definitely a great start to a hopefully great career. While it may not be everyone's personal favorite film, it will without a doubt leave its own unique imprint on the viewers who watch it. It strives to be original, funny, intriguing, and somewhat life changing, and I say it hits the mark very well on all of these points. Only time will tell whether or not this film makes it's way to the level of popularity as it's aforementioned indie predecessors of yesteryear.",The Kings of Summer

But it wasn't without its faults.The parents the kids want to escape are actually pretty bad, all things considered. I feel this was done to make sure the audience identifies with the teens and to get a few laughs, but I felt like it took away from the movie. I found the character of Biaggio really funny and interesting, but after a while, I started to feel bad that we were really just consistently laughing at him. In some ways, he was so outlandish that you don't feel bad (because no one is like that). But at other times, it felt like being back in high school and watching the weird kid get picked on.Overall, I liked this and I'd watch it again.

84,carlhuitong,"""Why live when you can rule""",7,21 November 2013,"The Kings of Summer (2013) is not a typical Hollywood film. It is real as well as natural, and it has an engrossing storyline, along with an impressive soundtrack similar to the one in ""The Tree of Life"". It is a story about an adolescent called Joe increasingly frustrated by his single father, Frank's attempts to manage his life. Defending his freedom again and again, he joins hands with his best friend, Patrick, and a peculiar boy called Biaggio. He announces that they are going to build a house in a wild place to escape from the control of parenthood. The three young men then starts a gripping and enlightening journey in the wild.There have been several age films, like Stand By Me, that have been released over years. The Kings of Summer is one of them that emotionally appealed to me, reminding my childhood. The bonding between the nature and childhood as well parenthood is in some way revealed in the movie. Children love getting closed to the natural environment, especially kids living in such a stressful and dynamic ""concrete forest"". Natural forest, filled with woods and diverse creatures shown in the film, are the one kids need and yearn for, but not the concrete forest filled with suffocating academic pressure and tons of workloads assigned by parents. Joe, summoning up the courage of which many youngsters are afraid to take, to fight against his parents to go to the wild to dance with woods and build a house made by woods.The movie is not just for childhood and parenthood, but also metaphorically extending to every domains in society. It gives a reflection on how we deal with the relationship between A and B. In the story, Joe is willing to give up the indispensable father-son relationship at first in order to follow his dream to build a wood-made house in the wild. But finally, he successfully build the house while he can repair the bonding between his father and himself. The principle may apply for in our daily life. Take Hong Kong as example, it is a high time Hong Kong people reflected what they did for themselves, for families, for society and for our natural environment. We are in a phase that stop moving and remaining on the same spot without a willingness to the ""change"". Singapore changes, South Korea changes, Taiwan changes, but Hong Kong? Worse still, the situation (in political and social senses) currently in Hong Kong seems to go backwards. At first, something has to be sacrificed. During the phase of changing, it may be different and uncertain. But the final result may surprise and reap the fruitful rewards.So, the hopefulness of ""Summer"" does not wait for the ""Kings"". Instead, the ""Kings"" have to find and explore the hopefulness of ""Summer"", just like Joe in the movie.",The Kings of Summer

Then it was officially released worldwide in May 2013 by CBS FilmsHey Joe Toy is a 15 year old teenager who is under pressure from his father, Frank. Joe here really wants freedom. He was really bored how his father behaved to him, moreover his brother was not at home with him and his mother had died, he wanted to do something different.
The family game that night stopped because Joe called the police to report Frank on false accusations.
At that time, Joe felt free and he fled to the forest with his best friend, Patrick, who was also tired of living in his family.
They meet a strange child named Biaggio who then joins them to the forest.
Joe said that they would make a house in the woods far from their responsibilities and parents.
When their temporary houses are finished, they try to live independently and depend on their own destiny in the forest.
Joe and Biaggio were responsible for being hunters, while Patrick had to find fruit.
You will be presented with a background of dense forestry, the atmosphere of the jungle is hot and hot ... truly amazing, a very neutral green color (full of peace)
Several weeks passed, Patrick and Joe were reported missing and appeared on several national TV shows.
Frank placed the remaining monopoly on their game that night in Joe's bag that was left on the bus.
He believes that Joe has deliberately mocked him.
A conflict ensued between Patrick and Joe when Joe invited his girlfriend Kelly to see the house they had built in the forest.
After a while, Kelly said that she began to like Patrick and they were in a relationship.
Joe then challenged Patrick in a monopoly game which ended in Patrick's defeat because of Biaggio's help.
Joe then gets angry and taunts Kelly for ruining his friendly relationship with Patrick.
Patrick decides to follow Kelly and leave Joe.
Joe, who was still angry, then snapped at Biaggio and told him to follow Patrick and kick him out.
A month later, Joe still lives alone in the forest.
Lacking money, he began to hunt animals like rabbits to eat.
Thanks to the rabbit he ate, Joe apparently invited a snake into his house.
Kelly told Frank that he could help her find Joe and take him back home.
Biaggio decides to come to help Joe alone in the forest, and finds Joe wrestling with a snake.
Biaggio also tried to kill the snake but he was bitten on his elbow and became poisoned ..
Joe's father, Frank came with Kelly when it happened and quickly took Biaggio to the hospital.
While in the hospital, Biaggio regained consciousness and told Joe that he would do the same thing if this happened again.
Then, after returning from the hospital, Joe met with Patrick and started laughing at their stupidity.
They get back together, and at the end of the film Biaggio still often visits their wooden house in the forest.
Here I get the teaching that, no matter how bad our parents are, they must do their best for their children, they do it because they care about us. And as children, we have the right to express that treatment, but in the right way, in this film we can see ... Joe and Patrick do the wrong way, they should not do that, their parents become very worried, because more of 4 weeks do not go home ... even though they are happy about it, but instead the people closest to them will really miss them to go home.The movie is easy to understand and the plot is not so complicated, very entertaining of course ...I gave it : 8.1 / 10 for the rating",The Kings of Summer

I was intrigued and impressed with each moment of the film. Something that specifically stood out to me was the cinematography and the overall beautiful scenery within the film. It takes you upon an emotionally roller coaster while testing the relationship between families and friends. Moises Arias portrays the hilarious little friend in a new, exciting way. Such a character like his would tend to be over-acted or seem fake, but he did not have this problem. Nick Robinson played the lead role in a captivating way and I can imagine this is just a taste of the success that he is about to receive. Nevertheless, The Kings of Summer left me wanting to re-watch the film over and over again and could easily be considered this generation's John Hughes and Cameron Crowe type film.

My view may be rather, or, is biased from the fact that I have seen Sean Penn's Into The Wild. I can't help but compare because of the key elements that were similar with the two films. After watching the earlier Sean Penn film, i felt that this may be a hopeful alternate ending to the previous. In contrast, Into the Wild covered a broad, profound, deep expression regarding the matters of self-discovery and identity; whereas, this film may have conveyed the subject in a more manageable way. On it self, the film is good film of teenage self-discovery. the practical man conflicted with his parents, friends, girls, and identity. i have to say it does not dive into the depths of the essence. but, it should be recognized for its ability to deliver such a subject to a broader audience, in a way that more people could get it and enjoy it.

Im sure the script is out there, unfunded by the men sitting on the money. So no this is not a teen movie or a coming of age movie. It's a boys movie. And yes pretty good but had enough of them. Btw the Belagio(?) boy too weird and didn't really fit in to the rest of the story, could've been tuned down a bit. Good acting though. Liked the father role and the one playing him.",The Kings of Summer

91,democratic-pizza,Remarkably Recommended and Meaningful,7,6 October 2013,"First off, I'd like to say that this is my first ever movie review. I'd been prolonging until I find a non-blockbuster movie that can really caught me deeply and The Kings of Summer happened to be the one.The acting in this movie is basically original, starring Nick Robinson who played Joe perfectly well as a fifteen year-old desperately wanting to get out of his dad's house under his rules just like a typical teenager. Then there's his best friend, Gabriel Basso who played as Patrick who loves his parents but also desperately wanting to get out of their house because of how their parents treat him as a child. Moises Arias as Biaggio, who I think really suits for the role of a physically small friend of both of them who appeared out of nowhere and could really get things funny because he's that lovable and warm. Joe's dad, Nick Offerman as Frank, played a great grumpy father who gets mad and cranky easily in this movie and then there's Erin Moriarty as Kelly, which plays the girl who Joe had a crush on. The movie at first started just like any ordinary drama movie, but the various shots and angles made it look pretty smart in the beginning. As you watch longer, the movie started getting interesting to where it's going, although you can really guess what will happen next. The Kings of Summer with its ""Into The Wild"" theme is packed with humor and a bunch of emotional feeling will be involved throughout the movie. Another plus point for this movie is the selection of songs in the background or soundtracks, how each song suits perfectly well based on the actions the characters were doing which really built up my point of view towards the movie. What caught me the most is how the movie is directed and made it as if he really wants us to feel to be like each one of the character involved there. The shots on the scenery and ""wild"" views in the forest really succeeded on making me re-think and went deeper about how there's more to the movie than what I've actually seen. The movie does have some really cliché teenager scenes, however, I like how it stays original and remain unpretentious by showing that there's a big chance that conflicts may happen between friends and families but then in the end you will always come back to them, by not having all the cheesy fights nor a corny truce. It sticks to reality and shows people that it is truly what it is.Not considering how old you are, I really recommend you to watch this movie with anyone for you're about to feel that youth blood pumping down your streams and actually get something out of it. Praise for Jordan Vogt-Roberts for making this movie as perfect, my eyes were glistening right at the very last scene of the movie and at the same time drawing a smile on my face.",The Kings of Summer
92,luyckxb,Mediocre movie without any surprise elements,5,8 September 2013,"Acting: ranging from awkward to mediocre.Story: it has key elements of growing pains but that's about it. No twisted plot, no surprise elements, nothing but the obvious.Script and editing: timing in most of the scenes is completely off, due to the inexperience of mainly the lead actor and his inability to make it all believable. He even smiles at moments where he shouldn't. He's not a 5 year old now is he? This could not be saved by some clever editing apparently, which is lacking throughout most of the movie anyway.A small part of the budget seems to have went to filming this and a larger part must have been put into good use by influencing the IMDb score because it certainly ain't worth a 7.x/10!I gave it a 5/10 because it's a comedy that made me laugh once. Which is usually one time more than most non-animated comedies. It's a movie I couldn't even remember the title of the day after. Seen it, warning people about it, moving on. Still, making a movie and bringing it to theaters takes effort so there you go, 5/10.",The Kings of Summer

I'm sure more happens as well but I didn't finish the film and you shouldn't either.

96,arsnbstrv,"Growing up is tough, but parents are there to support you",8,23 March 2020,"What I like in ""The Kings of Summer"" is that it very clearly shows that children are not ready to live on their own yet. They should more rely on their parents because parents do love them, no matter what shenanigans kids do. There are just different ways of showing this love.
But, in my opinion, this movie is not only for growing ups. It might be also very helpful for parents of these teens as it shows what is going on inside their heads: what they feel, what they want and what they are capable of.",The Kings of Summer
97,chimes-27353,Stick with this film,8,22 June 2020,"This is a great indie film. But in order to truly enjoy this film the viewer has to wait until they start building in the woods. The intro of this movie had a lot of ""Don't go there"" style jokes. That is why it is an 8. Intros are important, but it is not until the three MCs start bonding that this movie takes off. I think it is about 20-30 minutes into the film.At this point, the film became such an intimate portrait of the two longtime best friends, Joe and Patrick. Surprisingly, Biaggio becomes important as well. This movie even made me try to guess the ending. Great soundtrack as well. The drumbeat invented for the film is fun. This film has one of the best end credits song I've heard, that suits the film perfectly ""17"" by Youth Lagoon. Definitely stick with this film!",The Kings of Summer
98,jibson89,A fantastic coming of age comedy,8,28 April 2013,"Debut feature director Jordan Vogt-Roberts' Kings of Summer (née Toy's House) is a coming of age story of 2 best friends who decide to build a house in the woods to escape their families and their enigmatic friend Biaggio who accompanies them. The three kids give great performances and all seem so natural in their characters; Moises Arias is exceptionally funny as the oddball Biaggio. I caught the third ever showing at Sundance London followed by a director's Q&A and he remarked that many moments are just the kid's messing around and sometimes unaware they are being filmed. The montage scene of the kids playing in the woods and banging on the pipe that opens the film was filmed all in one day with just the kids, the D.P and director and is so naturally the sort of nonsense a group of teenagers would get up to. An amazing supporting cast including the always wonderful Nick Offerman, Alison Brie, Megan Mullally and Mary Lynn Rajskub perfectly deliver the material; it's an impressive cast for such a small film.Début writer Chris Galletta delivered a cracking script that delivers on the laughs and also has some strong emotional moments as the boys inevitably fallout over a girl and we see the kid's fractious relationship with their parents. A great mix of classic coming of age tales such as Stand By Me and the indie comedies of recent times that hits the comedic and dramatic notes without ever being saccharine, annoyingly quirky or overly morbid as so many indie comedies fall into. I highly recommend the film; it will transport you back to your terrible but wonderful teenage years and is genuinely hilarious, I can't imagine a single person not loving this film. Rating- 8/10",The Kings of Summer

The movie first start slowly but interestingly. I was thinking of a whole exciting plot and hope they will go that way. And the next 80 minutes of the film, all the characters really stuck in their own cage of poorly-defined characteristic. The pace was so slow and seriously, it was made for adults above 65. And the whole things was quite dull and boring. I tried to maintain sober and awake until the very last moment of the movie. But it was absolutely disappointing, and also that house is not exquisite at all :) Not highly-recommended and MUST NOT WATCH :) 4 overall for our gorgeous Patrick and Joe. And sometimes Biaggio is funny too.",The Kings of Summer

Which revolves around three kids who just want to run away from there parents. Joe( Nick Robinson ), a ambitious boy, living with his widowed father Frank ( Nick Offerman ). Frank is a stubborn father, do and want things to be done in his own ways. On the other hand, Patrick ( Gabriel Basso ), a mature boy, live with his parents who are freakishly weird and overly protective. Finally, Biaggio( Moises Arias )a goofy kid who ""just didn't want to do nothing"". These three kids found a place in a forest and made there mind to build a house.

102,sytske-s,The Future,8,5 August 2014,"This movie is the dream of every teen alive! Who wouldn't want to get out and live in his own house by his own rules at that age? I mean really, at this moment I'd do anything for that. (Probably changes once you grow up, but I haven't yet.) It's about growing up and becoming ""a man"", as well as the relationship between parents and their kids. Also, it shows how years of friendship can be ruined by one girl, and how easily it can be fixed too. The movie is about two best friends that are sick of the rules and control of their parents, and decide to start living on themselves, out in the woods, where no-one will ever find them. Accompanied by the random and socially awkward Biaggio (portraited by Moises Arias, outstanding job!), Joe (Nick Robinson) and Patrick (Gabriel Basso) are starting to become real men.The movie is not only every teens dream, as well as a good comedy. There were a lot of sarcastic, random, sometimes slightly racist jokes and loads of awkward, funny moments. I actually laughed out loud watching this movie. An extra shout out for the cast: Really great job! I think that the young cast of this movie (Talking about Gabriel Basso, Nick Robinson and Moises Arias) could very well be the next great actors. I suppose that at some point, they will be the Brad Pitts and Tom Hankses we go to the cinema for. And am I the only one seeing the resemblance between James Franco and Nick Robinson?

106,joshmars,Surprisingly Brilliant,10,3 April 2014,"I watched a trailer for this film that provided me with absolutely no information. Three boys making very average music by hitting a pipe with tree branches while one of them danced in the background. Somehow this grabbed my attention and I came to IMDb for more information. With nothing other than a completely uninformative teaser and a small synopsis, I grabbed the movie and watched it with a group of guys in my horrible little apartment lounge room.Then we literally grabbed more people and all watched it again the next day.Kings of Summer is successful in what I believe is it's ambition - It is different to any other coming of age film that has been around in a long time. It sets aside the need for the melancholy undertone and doesn't take itself too seriously. You know who this reminds me of? Most boys in their teens and early twenty-somethings, which is easily the target audience for this movie.Even the mention of Toy's mother dying didn't need a massive heart-wrenching scene. It was kept simple. They didn't want to much emotion or deep feelings to come out. Because this is really the theme of the story. Becoming a man.Kings of Summer is consistently funny when it needs to be, and both memorable and quotable. And a bonus for me, I got both Ron Swanson and Buster.

108,isaac-edwards,It's nearly really good. I promise.,6,7 November 2015,"I could easily write a review that is exactly what you expect to read about a film about 3 teenagers who run away from their (faintly embarrassing, but not actually all that oppressive, by any means) parents. It has the ultra-American high school party with the red cups. It has the douchey older boyfriend of the protagonist's love interest. It has the utter implausibility of the 3 teenagers being able to build a fully free standing, architecturally acceptable house in the middle of the woods, with engineering skills that didn't stand up to the challenge of building a bird box earlier in the film.But it tries really hard. Nick Offerman's downtrodden, wonton-weary father is hilarious, Moises Arias' Biaggio is creepy, lovable and hysterical in equal measure, and the soft-focus cinematography is often really beautiful.The main problem though, apart from the host of American-coming-of- age genre clichés, is that the inexplicably follically proficient protagonist, Joe (Nick Robinson) is simply not likable in the slightest. I would be surprised to see any viewer relate to him as he threatens his entirely more pleasant best friend Patrick with violence for the heinous act of falling for Kelly (Erin Moriarty), who failed to display any interest in Joe in the entire film.Somehow it still retains a charm, despite this. The direction and soundtrack, while occasionally jarring, are often really satisfying, and Offerman and Arias keep you laughing for long stretches of the film.Go and watch the trailer. It's really good. And best of all, it contains nearly all the good bits, so if you're short on time, there's no need to watch the actual movie.",The Kings of Summer
109,meurig63,Beautifully crafted film,8,1 June 2018,"I was taken with this film from the start. The cinematography is beautifully done, capturing the real essence of hazy summer days.

A film well worth a watch and its place at the Sundance Film Festival.",The Kings of Summer
110,lucasclough99,A Masterpiece,10,15 July 2015,"There's not a lot I can say about this movie just that it is a MASTERPIECE. This is a movie that once watched is hard to stop watching, mainly because of the pure genius that was produced. The movie can resemble typical teenager's life that wants to spend time with their friends, being independent and mainly rule at the same time. The movie includes comedy, adventure and drama all rolled into one.Jordan Vogt-Roberts was a first time director when making this movie and what a way to kick of his career with a movie like The Kings of Summer. He got the characters spot on in this movie and choose the perfect actors to play the characters; the three main characters are Joe Toy (Nick Robinson), Patrick Keenan (Gabriel Basso) and Biaggio (Moises Arias). He didn't just get the characters/actors spot on he got the set of where they were filming in the woods perfectly and makes me especially want to build my own house there.Joe has just finished his freshman year in high school and is about to spend his summer with his father Frank Toy (Nick Offerman). Frank makes Joe's life a misery and Joe dislikes him this plays a main part in Joe's run away. Joe's best friend Patrick lives with his mum and dad (played by Megan Mullally and Marc Evan Jackson) Patrick seriously dislikes living with his parents mainly because they control every bit of his life by being overprotective. Not wanting to be controlled by their parents both of them decide to run off into the woods and build their own house gather the food themselves and follow their own rules without know one knowing especially their parents. It wasn't just them two though that ran away from home their strange friend Biaggio also comes along not knowing why he ran off. Wanting company the three decide to have a house warming dinner with Kelly (Erin Moriarty) and a couple other friends as well. Joe deeply loves Kelly but she doesn't feel the same way as him.The Kings of Summer makes a great movie due to the great acting and the storyline. I highly recommend watching this as it will be a movie you wouldn't think twice of watching it again.",The Kings of Summer
111,darcy-stanford,Kings of Summer: A tale that charms with few errors to fix.,8,28 November 2013,"Kings of Summer tells the coming of age story of three teenage boys and their escape from their overbearing parents into the complete independence of the woods.Dealing with the triumphs and failures of teen love, total independence and friendship, Kings' delivers a point with a mixture of wit and drama that not only conveys its ideas well to the audience, but also brings impact to the narrative so those audiences can take away something from the film. The casting of the trio (Robinson, Basso, Arias) was an excellent choice but a stronger written character for Arias may have aided further in his performance being more corresponding to the films overall theme and the performances from Robinson and Basso. With that said Arias did the best he could with the character given. Supporting roles, especially Nick Offerman, were well received and all contributed to the story's themes well.A congratulations is in order to Jordan Vogt-Roberts for his debut feature film, his unique tale charms us with strong performances, a lazy yet warming story, and the right mixture of humour and drama. Kings of Summer, although dorky and superficial at points, has not fallen short of its genre and left audiences with the heart-warming essential essence that any coming of age film should.8/10",The Kings of Summer

Nick Offerman from ""Parks and Recreation"", and his wife, Megan Mullally, are hilarious in their respective parental roles.The film is beautifully shot and tightly-paced, and although there are some typical plot elements and a story that requires a little suspension of belief, the film feels very fresh and never drags.

And you also ask yourself how they carried couches and all the other materials across a very precarious area, as shown in one scene. It was a bit improbable, but the movie was good enough to forget it.The cast was terrific, though I thought the parents of Patrick a bit contrived, overacted & cornball (Not a realistic cornball, but funny at times).What got my rating was the actor who STOLE the show, like Melissa McCarthy did in bridesmaids....Moises Arias. He was what floated this movie with his believable corny and right on time delivery. I hope to see him in other films in the near future.Overall...it's a great movie for date night, but don't cry if you miss it in theaters. That said, DON'T miss it on Netflix!",The Kings of Summer

The character who played Rico in Hannah Montana acted in this movie as the character Biaggio. His acting was spot on and absolutely hilarious. Loved it! My only complaint was the character Kelly. Nothing wrong with the acting but the character herself had little depth and was overall a little irritating. She was needed to create the conflict between the boys but the dynamics of her persona were of. Still I would highly suggest this movie to families and it is great for all ages.

I originally rated this film an 8, but for the previous week the philosophical elements of this film have played on my mind and so I felt it right that i re-rated this film as a 10. Nick Robinson portrays a good-looking teenage boy that you can really emphasize with but at the same time you can be slightly worried what the character might do next, this adds a sense of suspense to the movie and keeps you hooked to the end.

117,mitchdumpy,"Potentially interesting concept, poor execution",4,8 September 2013,"The concept of this story has merit, however the execution is well off the mark in all respects. The story progression seems extremely rushed, partly due to the amount of unnecessary scenes and dialogue that have been afforded to cameo characters at various points. Some of the dialogue has comedic value, but for the most it's just basic.I think more time needed to be given to develop the main characters and to develop the plot, rather than to random scenes which hold no real relevance to either. The cosmetics which help keep everything believable were ignored in some respects. Simple things, like how do they store their shop bought chickens without refrigeration, where did they pull architect designs for their house from, why were there fireworks going off in the middle of the bush at night in the swimming scenes, was it necessary for the almost pre-pubescent boys to sprout obviously fake beards and random violin playing in the middle of the forest?

One of the greatest perks was the scenery; I also enjoyed the characters' growth throughout the movie, it was very apparent.

The only thing I might have changed was the ending, so because of this I am crossing my fingers there will be a sequel.

Who hasn't dreamed of running away? and who has not shared an incredible summer with friends, who are more like family? I came across this movie online and I don't know why it hasn't gotten more attention. This is my favorite film and I plan on watching it again. Its a mystery to me why the film is rated R.

If you take the time to watch this movie properly you will not be disappointed. Its fair to say its not just another Hollywood sell out, it actually takes you back to the mind set of being a kid that wants to explore an be free. From the heart touching friendships to the quirky kid this is a all round winner for me. It has the perfect range of romance,comedy,adventure and drama all merged into one.I hope you find as much joy in this movie as I did. I myself am a huge film fan watching thousands of them an it is really rare to come across something original an unique which this movie provides.In addition the soundtrack was really well placed an defiantly triggers the right emotions for the scenes.All acting was superber as well as the directing.

Normally, I would only give a movie of this caliber a 7 or 8, but once you see the mustache the main character grows you'll understand why it was 10 worthy. The whole time he was in the woods I was wondering if it was just dirt on his face. That's how good the mustache was. I'm jealous my facial hair growth is slightly better than that because I would love to have that pedo-stache on my face. Also, Moises Arias is a gem and a half. 90% of his lines make no sense, but I was digging the humor in it. This will go down as a movie that no one else enjoys. If I meet a girl who likes it, I'll probably marry that girl.",The Kings of Summer
