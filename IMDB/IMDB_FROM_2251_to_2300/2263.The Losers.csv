0,SnoopyStyle,good actors in simple comic book movie,6,29 December 2014,"Clay (Jeffrey Dean Morgan) leads Jensen (Chris Evans), Roque (Idris Elba), Pooch (Columbus Short) and Cougar (Óscar Jaenada) in a special operations in Bolivia. They try to stop the strike when they see the cartel using kids as mules. They try to evacuate the kids on their helicopter. However, they are doublecrossed and their helicopter gets shoot down thinking the team is on it. In the ensuing bad press, the government declares them deceased and deny any knowledge of their operation. Agent Aisha (Zoe Saldana) tracks down the team for a mission to stop Max (Jason Patric) who is trying to sell a high tech weapon to the highest bidder.The movie doesn't waste any time on exposition or introducing the characters. The plot is simplistic. The villain is a cartoon. It doesn't build much upon it comic book identity. That's both its weakest and its strength. The actors are solid although the team probably needs one comedian. The sardonic jokes are simple fun. It needs a more interesting script and some crazier action. The action is probably prohibited by the lower range budget.",The Losers
1,nogodnomasters,GREAT ACTION FILM,10,5 December 2018,"EARLY PLOT SPOILERThe movie starts out with an elite undercover group (The Losers) operating in Bolivia. An air strike is called in to take out some drug dealers. The Losers espy children in the group being used as ""mules."" They attempt to call off the strike, only to be foiled on the radio by a guy named ""Max."" With 5 minutes left, they go in and do a rescue operation, saving the kids from the air strike. A helicopter comes down to pick them up, but can't transport both The Losers and the 25 kids so the The Losers give up their seats (Buddy Holly thanks you.) The Helicopter is shot down and all those kids are killed.The Losers realize they were the target and they toss their dog tags into the wreckage to make it look like they died. While living ""undercover"" in Bolivia they meet Zoe Saldana who tells them she can get them back home if they go kill Max for her. The movie contains some minor plot twists, but it is not complicated. The characters are convincing and likable. The acting was simply great. The dialogue was original, crisp, and witty. The soundtrack was great, but why does every movie which involves spooks (CIA) and Latin America plays ""Black Betty?""Recap: Great movie. Action keeps moving. Great dialogue. Humor. Good characters. Really was nothing not to like. Zoe is hot too. It is on par with Basic.",The Losers
2,kosmasp,Hits and misses,7,6 June 2020,"The cast or rather the group of the Losers is quite astonishing. A group of misfits that you just have to love. Chris Evans in a role that nowadays would be a shoe in for Ryan Reynolds. He overall does a great job though, so don't try to compare or evaluate him based on that.Chris has got his T-Shirt tick that I reckon is based on the comics this is based on (never read them). But with the jokes it is hits and misses. Some really hit dead on, some others just deflate. Having said that, one of the major spoiling points for me is Idris Elba. I love him and I think he's an amazing actor, but his character in this one, really does not do him justice at all.So this is quite predictable and does not warrant any subtle notions. It does however have a saving grace in the person of Zoe Saldana - action hereoine par excellence. Talking about that, the stunts are really good and work nicely. So at least a decent movie, depending on your expectations of it",The Losers
3,classicsoncall,"""Like the angle of the dangle?""",6,3 August 2021,"The credibility of the story falls apart as soon as the extraction helicopter carrying the twenty five kids gets taken out on Max's (Jason Patric) order. It couldn't hold any more, so how could news reports state that Clay's (Jeffrey Dean Morgan) five man team died as well? After that, it was just grin and bear it for me, an action film that delivers, but with impossible stunts and a conflicted romantic angle between Clay and Aisha (Zoe Saldana), daughter of a terrorist who was the original target of Clay's forces. What was the point of their heated battle upon first meeting? Couldn't figure that out. Precision timing and an improbable trajectory sent Max's henchman Wade (Holt McCallany) into an airplane engine that took out traitor Roque (Idris Elba) when it blew up, while Clay's swan dive catch of the pressure release trigger of the activated bomb just screamed nonsense. Yet with bad guy Max getting away and the prospect of Clay and Aisha renewing their feud, the word 'sequel' was written all over the finale. That, and the fate of the Petunias versus the Marigolds.",The Losers
4,jboothmillard,The Losers,4,24 October 2010,"Someone told me that this was a good film, and from the trailer I saw I was sure I would agree with them, but the critics weren't very keen on it, I only found that out afterwards though. Basically the film focuses on the members of an elite U.S. Special Forces unit who were sent to the Bolivian jungle on a search and destroy mission, where they succeeded in saving a group of children but then it blew up, and they were presumed dead. A while later the group, Clay (Jeffrey Dean Morgan), Jensen (Fantastic Four's Chris Evans), Roque (Idris Elba), Pooch (Columbus Short) and Cougar (Óscar Jaenada), are still stranded in Bolivia. They are brought back together when the mysterious beautiful operative Aisha (Avatar's Zoë Saldaña) wants them to carry out a mission. They stay deep undercover, with the villains slowly realising they are still alive, and they are working together to stop the powerful enemy known as Max (Speed 2: Cruise Control's Jason Patric). The heavily guarded and ruthless man plans to secretly steal millions of dollars using a high tech computer hard-drive system, which he will also use to cause global war. The gang, or The Losers if you want, break into security buildings, have big shoot-ups and cause many explosions, but int he end they obviously save the day. Also starring Holt McCallany as Wade, Peter Macdissi as Vikram and Tanee McCall as Jolene. The wise-cracks of Evans were fine, Patric from what I remember was an alright villain, and Saldana was gorgeous viewing, I think the only thing keeping me hooked were the explosions and guns blazing, apart from that, nothing new, but an alright action adventure. Okay!",The Losers
5,Quinoa1984,a guilty Saturday-afternoon pleasure,7,26 April 2010,"The Losers isn't a movie I can recommend outright as a really fantastic example of its genre, far from it. It has some logical gaps, especially towards its ending with the character resolutions (or lack thereof), and the use of slow-motion in the action scenes already dates it to an extent by its 'Hipness'. But it's also got just the right attitude, humor and energy to get by as what I might call a 'Saturday afternoon' quickie. This is the kind of flick that a guy would watch when he should be doing something else around the house or something. It's tough and unapologetic and a little too slick to be anything else than what it is. I enjoyed The Losers against my better judgment.The premise and follow-through is kind of predictable, as it's about a group of elite fighters (think the A-Team) who get double-crossed by a rogue CIA agent and find a possible entry point with a mysterious woman to get back at him and clear their names. We see who will probably betray who, or what twists might occur, and sure the BIG WEAPON (in caps) that is used by Max (played with a cartoon character debonair by Jason Patric) is so preposterous as to be wholly entertaining. But the cast is up for playing these parts with every ounce of fun and excitement in the material, and I liked seeing the camaraderie between Morgan, Evans and Elba (the latter really coming into his own as a star), and Zoe Saldana shows off again how she's becoming a formidable talent in Hollywood films.It's a hard movie to always defend for its plot inconsistencies, but it works in its own lets-just-play-it-loose logic. And sometimes the actors just cut loose, which is nice; seeing Chris Evans somehow inject life into using 'Don't Stop Believing' by Journey in an espionage scene is one of the most brilliant things of the year (if only because, simply, how could you use that song again after the Sopranos). And when it comes time for the BIG action set-piece at the end, it gives a good dose of what action movie fans look for: plausible implausibility, some gritty violence (albeit PG-13, it's still pretty intense), and a few real surprises in the course of events, for better and worse. I can't stress enough that it's not a particularly high achievement in its sort of movie. But for what it sets out to achieve, it does alright, which is enough sometimes.",The Losers
6,dbborroughs,Great fun,9,26 July 2010,"Absolutely enjoyable action film about a team US soldiers who rebel at the thought of killing kids only to be double crossed and have to lay low since everyone thinks they're dead. The chance for redemption and revenge arrives when a woman shows up supposedly with info on Max, the phantom who set them up. This sets in motion a chain of events which result in great action set pieces and the hope of a sequel.I haven't read the comic but I'd like to since if it's anything like this it probably kicks ass.I absolutely loved this in a mindless popcorn sort of away.Infinitely better than most of the recent action films of this summer I can't believe that I missed this in theaters Great heroes, nasty villains, a semi complicated plot, wicked lines of dialog and great action all come together to make one of the finds of the year.not high art but it is great fun.",The Losers

8,Boba_Fett1138,"Nothing really bad about this movie, just never one I enjoyed watching.",5,7 August 2011,"This is quite an odd movie. Nothing is really all that bad about it but it somehow, at the same time, also never manages to really entertaining or intrigue in any way.Yes, this basically is a movie you can very easily do without. It also wasn't really a commercial success at the time of its release and it's basically a movie that is extremely forgettable.Everything is so bland about this movie. It features all of the typical characters and the story really isn't original or surprising in any way. But what is maybe worse is that the comedy is also really bland. This really was supposed to be a fun and entertaining action comedy to watch but let me ask you; where is the fun and comedy in this all? This is what mostly makes ""The Losers"" a disappointment and also ultimately a very forgettable movie, you can easily do without.Because of this all, you just also never really get into this movie or get to care about any of its characters. I actually have no idea what the story was all about, simply because I couldn't care less about anything that was happening in it. But it also is really because the movie isn't pleasant to follow. The pacing is really off and tries to be too hip and stylish with its action but also when there is nothing happening in this movie at all. All sequences in this movie feel really very disconnected from each other, as if they were shooting about 3 different movies at the same time, that they only at the end decided to throw together in the editing room. Things that happen in the movie don't seem to have any consequences later on, so why should you even bother to try and follow it.But at the very same time it is also thanks to its very high pace that the movie still remains a watchable one. It just never becomes boring, even when not an awful lot is happening and luckily the movie is also filled with plenty of action.Biggest mystery of this movie remains why Sylvain White was appointed as director. He has a terrible track record with movies like ""Stomp the Yard"", ""Trois 3: The Escort"" (what?) and ""I'll Always Know What You Did Last Summer"". The straight to video third movie out of the 'I Know What You Did Last Summer' trilogy, that no one has ever heard of or seen. Why should you appoint such a director, who doesn't even have experience with action, to your multi-million movie production. But having said that, this movie is probably the best one out of his career, as of yet, which is thanks to its same multi-million budget. You just can't call this movie a small one and its slick looking with plenty of good action in it.It also isn't the actor's fault really that none of their characters really work out interesting enough. Just blame the source material, the writing and pacing for that. But even so, I have to say that Zoe Saldana seemed really miscast. She was supposed to be a strong, independent, female character, with some femme fatale touches to it. But she really doesn't have the right looks for such a role, basically because she looks like a small gust of wind could had knocked her over at any time.With all this criticism, it sounds like this is a very bad movie but like i mentioned before, there is not really anything that is horrible about this movie. Every flaw and weakness just make this movie a not so very entertaining or enjoyable movie to watch but its pacing, look and action is all so slick and fast that you often tend to forgive the movie its weaknesses and simply go along with the ride, no matter how silly it all can get as well at times.5/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",The Losers
9,george.schmidt,Better-than-anticipated popcorn crowd-pleaser big-screen actioner,8,17 May 2010,"THE LOSERS (2010) *** Jeffrey Dean Morgan, Zoe Saldana, Chris Evans, Idris Elba, Columbus Short, Oscar Jaenada, Jason Patric, Holt McCallany. Better-than-anticipated popcorn crowd-pleaser big-screen actioner adaptation of the cult comic-book about a group of CIA black ops seeking some serious payback after a vicious setback involving a for-hire assassination leads their employer to have them offed in the process. A witty, funny and oddly compelling script by Peter Berg and James Vanderbilt keeps things bouncing along nicely with loads of shoot-em ups/blow-em ups and a cast having a field day (particularly Morgan as the defacto leader of the motley crew and sultry ass-kicking Saldana as a mystery woman who has her own stakes at risk, and Patric as the hissable villain having a lot of fun in the interim).

10,neil-476,Light hearted actioner,7,11 February 2011,"I go to see my parents on Friday evenings. Being in their 80s, they sometimes tend to lapse into, how can I put it, complaint mode, so it's good to have a movie on hand at such moments. However, they're not terribly happy about bad language, they don't like anything too serious, they like movies to be bright and colourful rather then dark and desaturated, so it's not always easy to come up with something which works for them and me.The Losers was absolutely perfect. Its single F word was rapidly over, and there was plenty of bright colourful action as its uncomplicated A Team plot unfolded. The script was breezy fun with a fair sprinkling of chucklesome lines, Zoe Saldana looked fetching in her skimpies, and the movie entertained them - and me - solidly for 90 minutes or so.It is not a substantial movie, but it is good fun.I may go looking for the comic now...",The Losers
11,evanston_dad,"""The A-Team"" on a Bargain Budget",6,2 January 2011,"If movie ticket prices were scaled to the film's budget and star power, I might suspect that ""The Losers"" was made for all the people who couldn't afford to go see ""The A-Team."" As it stands, it's a bargain bin version of that other movie, and since you're going to have to spend the same amount of money to rent both, you might want to pick just one and save your money for something else.But if you like your action dumb and generic, ""The Losers"" will fit the bill. Jason Patric makes a terrible and terribly unintimidating villain, and Zoe Saldana isn't nearly as sexy as I thought she was going to be, and the fact that this movie eked by with a PG-13 rating despite the copious amounts of senseless killings and its supreme glamorization of guns appals me, but if you're an intelligent adult who knows when he's being fed a big load of crap, you might enjoy it for what it is.Grade: B-",The Losers
12,anaconda-40658,The Winners!,6,5 June 2015,"The Losers (2010): Dir: Sylvain White / Cast: Jeffrey Dean Morgan, Zoe Saldana, Chris Evans, Idris Elba, Jason Patric: Amusing action comedy that doesn't always work but it does have the personalities to back it up. Title doesn't necessarily ring true because even though these guys are a few steps behind, they still get the job done. They are a special forces unit believed dead after a helicopter explosion. They receive opportunity to wreck revenge on the evil mastermind who set them up. Directed by Sylvain White with much humour in tact and action sometimes out of hand. Jeffrey Dean Morgan plays the Colonel who doubts his leadership skills after a tragedy occurs that cost the lives of children. His leadership is also doubted and tested by others but his skill is obvious. Zoe Saldana steals scenes as a contact who issues the Losers an opportunity to get back into the U.S and get revenge. What makes her interesting is that it isn't always clear what her motives are. She isn't totally trusted, which added tension. Chris Evans provides comic relief as one of the Losers who takes several risks that often payoff with amusing results. Idris Elba plays another member who lacks faith in their force and adds for a decent plot twist. Finally we have Jason Patric whose career seems built around material just like this, although Narc remains perhaps his best work. Unfortunately this all winds down to action violence that carries on longer than welcomed. While the action is entertaining, it is the humour that excelled best. Otherwise this is a pointless action farce that is clever and a winner. Score: 6 / 10",The Losers
13,deloudelouvain,I think people have poop in their eyes when I see the ratings,2,20 December 2015,"What to say say after watching this movie. Incredible! Amazing! Unbelievable! And those are not for the movie but for the ratings it gets here. 6.4 rating, really? Did I watch the same movie as you? After five minutes I already knew I was going to suffer watching this garbage. But I have one rule, and that's how bad the movie is, if I started it I will finish it until the end. And with this one it was difficult. I don't get how you can make such an awful movie with a 25 million dollar budget? You would think the cast wasn't that bad, but still it was painful to watch. My level of irritation was at it highest during the whole movie. The story must be written by a teenager, I really can't see an adult writing such a bad script. Five mercenaries that are in fact guys with a great heart and great humor take on the evil person they use to work for. I'm being sarcastic here, by the way. Add on that the usual hot chick bimbo, that weighs about 50 kilos and that has fighting techniques from a ninja warrior. A woman that is so fragile but can beat a gorilla. Yeah right! Every action scene is funny for the mercenaries. They risk their life with a big smile and ridiculous jokes during combat. The whole movie is so predictable you sincerely hope you got it wrong and that they all die at the end. And then there is the actual ending. A normal ending for an awful movie like this one. An ending where I almost had to get a bucket to puke in. One last note, the music or soundtrack is also utter garbage, awful like the movie. If you want to be irritated during a whole movie then this is the movie to watch.",The Losers
14,DICK STEEL,A Nutshell Review: The Losers,6,16 May 2010,"A group of highly trained soldiers got framed for a military crime they did not commit, and these men promptly escaped to the Bolivian underground and are trying to figure things out and get home to the USofA. In the meantime, if you have a problem, if no one else can help, and if you and find them, maybe you can hire, the A-Team, not!The premise of The Losers well, sound very much like the other upcoming summer blockbuster and television remake The A-Team, with a group of military black ops men getting betrayed by the hand that fed them, and decide that it's payback time, their only clue being a voice at the other end of the line called Max (Jason Patric) who didn't have the compassion to abort an airstrike given the presence of children on the grounds of a drug baron. So our Losers - Colonel Clay (Jeffrey Dean Morgan of Watchmen's Comedian fame), 2nd in command Rogue (Idris Elba), sniper Cougar (Oscar Jaenada), vehicle expert Pooch (Columbus Short) and tech wizard Jensen (Chris Evans) - decide to hit the ground, only to find themselves become ""ghosts"" by the end of their ordeal.Needing to gather resources to get home, it's basically seek and you shall find as the Losers hang around the Bolivian underground. Which is what Zoe Saldana's Aisha did, when she sought them out to help in her objective in eliminating their common enemy, the secretive Max. But Aisha herself is a bit of a wild card and serving as the romantic interest of Clay, brings about some tension between the well-oiled group of men. So essentially the story follows everything you see in the trailer, where the group get transported back to home soil, before their tasking for Aisha unravels a diabolical plan of Max's to seek out new high-tech WMDs (made by Indian scientists, rather than the usual Euro/Russian bandits) set to detonate at the LA Port.There's only one singular objective in watching the Losers on the big screen, and that's to see how creative the action sequences can get. However, Sylvain White seem to have run out of fresh, innovative ideas, since almost everything here is something which you've probably seen before. Most of the action scenes were featured in the trailer, so that's just about spoil any would-be surprises, if at all. The fun of course is always when the Losers head into a mission utilizing the spectrum of their skillsets, although this sometimes would call for the suspension of belief. For instance, there's the activation of bombs and the firing of weapons toward an armed motorcade in broad daylight in a busy major intersection, coupled with noisy helicopters flying overhead, and simply put, there isn't a single figure of authority around to give chase. Granted it's not that kinda movie, but still it makes everything seem really implausible, and can only come straight out of a graphic novel. Plot loopholes are aplenty as well, with the usual monologues and the why-must-I-line-them-up-to-shoot/kill-them routine, which is simply inexplicable.The only way to enjoy this action flick, is to just accept everything at face value. It's not without positives though, and my vote goes to Chris Evans' role as Jensen being the live-wire character (as per the source material) in wise-cracking through the film, and fans of Captain Marvel will take note from this film that he's already bulking up in time to be that super soldier Steve Rogers.",The Losers
15,namashi_1,Routine Action Fare...,5,19 September 2010,"Sylvain White's 'The Losers' is a routine action fare, that takes predictability as a demi-god. The mantra of the makers is clear: Make a good-looking film, bring in great stunts, notable actors and a good marketer. In those all aspects, 'The Losers' gets it right! 'The Losers' is often-repeated story of the Good versus the Bad. The Good lose everything, thanks to the evil-minds. But... they finally take revenge and teach the sinner a lesson.Novelty wise, it's nil. Entertainment wise, it's quite there. One more aspect that works big time in this escapist show, is the Action. The Stunts are Super and truly memorable! Sylvain White's direction is fine, it's more of the Stunt-Codinator's film. Scott Kevan's Cinematography captures the Stunts nicely. The Editing is is just right.Performance-Wise: Zoe Saldana looks a million bucks, and is the pick of the lot. Jeffrey Dean Morgan is strictly okay. Idris Elba is effective. Chris Evans, as always, is excellent. Jason Patric hams to the hilt. Columbus Short is passable.On the whole, watch it if you must, and if you even miss it, let me tell you, you are not missing any milestone.",The Losers
16,lasttimeisaw,The Losers,4,15 February 2012,"How bad this comic-strip spin-off action film from Hollywood hacks could be? At least it's not repellent, or maybe just a tad, thanks to the former rising star Jason Patric's embarrassingly frivolous interpretation of the villain (""no one remembers SPEED 2: CRUISE CONTROL 1997?""), even Keanu Reeves is ruthlessly sidelined by a younger generation, much less this would be a welcome comeback for Mr. Patric.As long as comic books are still resting comfortably in my cluelessness zone, I have no penchant to be misguided by the popularity of the original material. The film is plainly a disastrously planned revenge story by a bunch of rogue CIA op teams, an upgraded version of the ever-so-similar genre best remembered in 1980s' B-grade video market where action hunks strive for a mainstream cheque. So now a few decades has passed by, it's frustrating to admit the gimmick in this film is way lagging behind its time. The film is also in shortage of any potential to become a cult classic, with well-conceived corny procedures, the adrenalin level is always beneath the threshold, maybe a wiser alternative is just flipping through the trailer where the marrows are all there (such as the reckless finger- shooting from a pre-Captain American Chris Evans), thus saving a great amount of glazed-over time.The over-saturated color shade is a tint of eyeball-irritating, and the cast itself doesn't seem to care too much about the film as well, maybe the only one who benefits from it is a further career-leap for Zoe Saldana, who has made a decent preparatory warm-up for her heroin formula with the likes of COLOMBIANA (2011), a black version of Angelina Jolie in the action ilk is more than just to meet the eyes, also to pitch-perfectly meet the demanding market.",The Losers
17,KineticSeoul,"Good cast, but everything else is executed poorly",4,28 April 2010,"This movie is a decent rental, but really not worth watching it in theaters. In another words it just a flick that might get you pumped for the better movies that is coming out this summer. Just about everything in this has been done before but much better, and even while you see things blowing up and crap it just isn't that exciting or entertaining. Which is a shame cause the cast is pretty legit, but almost everything else falls short. The main villain in this, tries way too hard but just comes off as being awkward most of the time. It's a below average action flick and in order to make it seem better than it really is, it has these choppy cinematography, random slow motions that really ain't that necessary and bunch of pauses. It also tries a bit too hard to be all comic book like but it just doesn't feel like a comic book movie either, not saying the comic book to this was any better. Bunch of 10 yr olds might enjoy watching this in theaters, thinking it's all cool and all but for movie vets than seen and know about good or better movies might just be somewhat entertained watching this at home with a couple of friends instead. Not terrible, but far from rushing out to theaters in order to watch it.4.8/10",The Losers
18,Robert_duder,A terrific ensemble team action flick...one of the summer greats!! It buries the A-Team and even The Expendables in story and characters,9,20 August 2010,"I saw The Losers early on in the summer and having just watched it again I was shocked when I realized I missed reviewing it. But this only gives me another chance to look at it and I must say I think I enjoyed it even more the second time around. I think its truly a shame that the film didn't do well because in comparison to the other team action flicks of the summer (The A-Team and The Expendables) The Losers is the best of the three. The story is stronger, the cast is more fun and have much better chemistry and its simply just a fun, non stop action flick. It definitely holds some throwback to old stylish action flicks but manages to come in as a PG-13 film holding back true blood splatter and violence but still maintaining incredible explosions and gun fights. The script is witty and fun and full of humour reminiscent of other great comedy action flicks like Die Hard or Lethal Weapon. The single only down side to the film is how everything wraps up. This isn't a plot fault or a problem with the story but rather an unfortunate lead in to what could be a real kick butt sequel but due to box office numbers that sadly is not likely to happen.Jeffrey Dean Morgan is becoming a real force to be reckoned with in Hollywood and I really hope that continues. Although he is 44 I think he has some great action roles in him and he can be emotional and macho and sentimental all at once. He's an every guy, and is just fun to watch. He leads the cast with skill and talent. As popular as she has become Zoe Saldana isn't the best of the cast. She does alright but I don't think she truly takes the part home. Her and Dean Morgan are sort of awkward together although their first fight is truly an epic and well choreographed hot battle. Chris Evans definitely has an up and down career. He has to be sparingly used in the right roles and with the right script and this works perfectly for him. He's sarcastic and fun and great with one liners. Idris Elba is no slouch at acting but I can't honestly say I've seen him anything. However, he is great in this role although doesn't get a front and centre part. He is still integral to the story and to the team. Him and Dean Morgan are excellent together as well throughout the story. Columbus Short and Óscar Jaenada round out The Losers and both are really terrific characters. I would love to see them both get more depth in future instalments where we can find out more. Jason Patric is nothing short of a brilliant action flick villain. He is amazing and perfect in the role and the only downside is because the film makers wanted to bring him back again is that he doesn't get a just end to his villainy. Finally Holt McCallany is nothing short of amazing as Patric's right hand muscle man. He is the perfect sub villain to Patric's villain.Something that both The Expendables and The A-Team missed was chemistry between the team members and that is where The Losers succeeds in a big way. The team fits together so well and you sense the loyalty and camaraderie between them. Director Sylvain White is a relative newcomer to directing a big budget action flick but clearly he knows how to handle a solid ensemble cast. I can't speak too strongly for Peter Berg's directing skills (I didn't care for Hancock, and he's set to direct Battleship based on the board game...'nuff said) but as co-writer with James Vanderbilt they create a really terrific team and a fun story and a solid base for a great series....hear that film makers...give us another shot at The Losers. It is insanely entertaining and a terrific ride!! 9/10",The Losers
19,bowmanblue,A poor man's A-Team,7,29 September 2014,"The Losers is about a team of elite soldiers, double-crossed and left for dead on foreign soil. Don't you just hate it when that happens? Therefore, they must hunt down and blow up everything. Well, the probably refine it to those responsible for their situation, but they pretty much blow up everything in their path.The plot is certainly not original. Everything in the big-budget version of the A-team does it better. However, that's not to say that The Losers doesn't have its merits.Yes, it's a B-movie, but it has enough decent actors to give it just that little bit more appeal than your average 'filler' movie. None of the cast are given enough screen time to really develop their characters, as the movie is quite short, but if you're in the mood for plenty of explosions, shoot-outs and punch-ups - all of which are filmed in a very cool 'slow-mo' way, then give this a go.Trust me, there are plenty of worse action B-movies out there!",The Losers

And all of it was so generic, nothing really cool. No neat car chases or thinking required. The bad guy, Max, was the most interesting. We know he's pure evil because he kills kids, shoots random people, and wants to buy these bombs that wipe out land without a bunch of negative side effects. His goal is to sell them to the highest bidder and start a war. He had a lacky, Wade, that was funny.FINAL VERDICT: Too much going on and there aren't any actors you have heard of.

I thoroughly enjoyed the action but I feel this movie could have been longer with additional character development. The acting was pretty good. Jason Patric was not a bad villain and I thought Zoe Saldana was the best of the the good guys.This movie is basically about revenge. A group of soldiers were supposed to have been killed in Bolivia but they were not. Now they are on a mission to kill the people who wanted to kill them.There were some pretty cool scenes. My favorite scene was when Chris Evans did the fake shooting at the guards.Overall, this is a decent action flick but it has many holes. I would check out Batman or Iron Man before this. I rate this film 7/10.",The Losers

But let's not pretend it's anything more then that.",6,9 February 2011,"(Credit IMDb) A tale of double cross and revenge, centered upon the members of an elite U.S. Special Forces unit sent into the Bolivian jungle on a search and destroy mission. The team-Clay, Jensen, Roque, Pooch and Cougar -find themselves the target of a lethal betrayal instigated from inside by a powerful enemy known only as Max. Presumed dead, the group makes plans to even the score when they're joined by the mysterious Aisha, a beautiful operative with her own agenda. Working together, they must remain deep undercover while tracking the heavily-guarded Max, a ruthless man bent on embroiling the world in a new high-tech global warThe Losers is a fairly entertaining shoot-e'm up style of movie, no doubt about that, with a bit more style then most. But it tries to hide many of its flaws with those same qualities, and it just doesn't possess the script to do that. The characters are cool, likable, and deliver hip dialog, with a pretty cool opening as well. I also thought the twist at the end was pretty clever as well. Plenty of nifty action scenes to keep you on your toes, and to hide the flaws it's had. Good time-waster, nothing more, nothing less.Performances. Jeffrey Dean Morgan makes for a cool lead. His voice is reminiscent of Brad Garrett's in my opinion. He wasn't anything overly special, but he got the job done, and I enjoyed him. Zoe Saldana is a favorite of mine, in more ways then one. She is of course gorgeous, but her character has style, and attitude to spare. She is great in the action scenes, and I liked her character background. Chris Evans is cocky, cool, and fun to watch. He balances it all with charisma. Idris Elba adds a nice presence, and his character has a good twist. Columbus Short continues his rise in the acting ranks and delivers a good show. Óscar Jaenada is enjoyable as cougar, while Jason Patric is OK as the villain, not a big fan of his.Bottom line. It's the perfect time waster. It won't make your day, it won't wow you. But you'll certainly enjoy its hip, cool style, at least I did. Well worth a look 6 ½ /10",The Losers

Apparently this movie isn't about infantile males ogling super-herotic images in their parents' basement, it's about a group of mercenaries seeking revenge.While on a mission to assassinate a Bolivian drug dealer, Clay (Jeffery Dean Morgan) and his team of killers (Chris Evans, Idris Elba, Columbus Short, Óscar Jaenada) are betrayed by their benefactor, Max (Jason Patric), who sabotages the team's escape plan. Unfortunately for Max– a man in the midst of selling ""green"" weapons on the open market–The Losers survive.Lying low, with the world thinking them dead, Clay and his boys plot their revenge, which involves kidnapping Max. During that course of action, however, they accidentally appropriate his hard-drive and recruit a new member (Zoe Saldana) who has a personal connection to the Bolivian job.Based on the Vertigo comic book series, The Losers is an ostentatious ensemble action flick: the violence is vibrant, the acting is over-the-top and the direction is stylish.In fact, it should become a Comic-Con tradition to chant the title of this movie/comic book at the top of your lungs while circulating amongst the crowds.

Basically a special-ops team is on a mission in Bolivia when they are set up and left for dead. So they decided to hide out in Bolivia waiting for the perfect time to get their revenge. The team consists of a sniper, a driver, a tech-op, and a heavy weapons specialist as well as their commander. However there are a couple of fractures forming in the team as they desire to return home to see their families, but are unable to do so because they are supposed to be dead.However, they are approached by a woman who asks for their help in getting back at Max, who is a CIA operative that is trying to get his hands on some super weapons to start another war with the terrorists. The woman, though, has her own agenda, and there is a concern that their commander is being led by his manhood than his mind. However, they agree, get back to the US, are set up, and then in one final battle, defeat the bad guy and are reunited with their family.All sound very familiar? Well that is because it is, and it has nothing to do with the comic book that it is based upon. This is a storyline that is older than the A-Team (of which the story is very familiar). Personally I prefer the A-team because the characters are better, and the idea a little more (though not quite) original.

27,Floated2,Entertainning but Predictable!,7,3 July 2010,"The Losers is a film based on comics about a team of black-opps force who goes on mission and crime fighting. This is the first time I watched an action film in a long while and though it wasn't an excellent movie, I have to admit that it was entertaining and quite surprising. Of all the leads, it was Chris Evans who stole the show and provided some comic moments in the film. The villain was also very annoying. Whether this was intentional or not, it would have been better if he was less campy and less clichés. Morgan looked too old and chunky to be doing the action sequences. The movie was also full of clichés. In some scenes, you can almost predict when there will be a car blast, when someone will get shot and when the lead star will save the day. This movie is ideally watched if you have nothing to do and just need to watch something entertaining. Don't expect a great action movie so that you won't get disappointed. Maybe because it was rated PG-13, it was a good movie but it could have been better. Also I found it to be quite confusing at some scenes, but in the end it was good.

28,TheMovieDiorama,"The Losers may win in style, but loses in conveying an exciting plot.",5,19 April 2018,"For me, this is a difficult one to judge. It's full of bumbling personalities, exciting set pieces and comedic one liners, yet it lacks depth. A dull clichéd plot that is as unmemorable as the eponymous group. So do I view this as an exercise of mindless action, or take it as a decent adaptation of the graphic novels? An elite black ops group are tasked in preventing a mysterious individual, simply known as Max, from unleashing a device that can dematerialise the vicinity that it is activated within. A ""Snuke"". It quite literally sucks nearby mass into oblivion like an obese person hoovering up the crumbs of the pizza they had last night with their mouth, leaving no trace of its existence. Environmentally friendly and explosively potent, how thoughtful. Much like the plot device, the narrative is rapidly paced. Lightning fast dialogue, each bursting with unique characterisation, that humorously creates an enjoyable flick. It is undeniably watchable, no question. The onscreen talent makes it even easier to sit back and relax, knowing that Morgan, Evans, Saldana and Elba are powering through the script. The bombardment of action set pieces enhances the entertainment value substantially. Yet despite all of the above, there is a sense of mediocrity. A sense of familiarity. Ahhh yes, 'The A-Team' remake that was released in the same year. These two films draw impeccable comparisons that unfortunately deters from any originality that this film attempted to acquire. The plot in itself was rather generic, filled with clichéd character choices that you could see coming from a mile away. White's directing style was far too frantic with extreme usage of zooms, quick cuts and lack of camera focus that made certain combat scenes hard to follow. The visual effects were noticeably awful, particularly explosions such as the motorbike crashing into the jet scene. The antagonist was far too mysterious that actually he made no impact to the story. Needless to say, The Losers is unmemorable and consequently is not a winning blockbuster.",The Losers
29,Movie_Muse_Reviews,"Packed with action clichés, ""Losers"" still entertains by milking them well",6,1 August 2010,"There are countless ways to interpret a comic series for the big screen, not including story. ""The Losers"" could've been done as a straight-up action film about a team of black ops soldiers getting revenge on the man who left them for dead, but director Sylvain White opts to honor the source material with an equally slick production. Although it fattens the film up with action movie clichés, it gels with the tone of the script and the carefree romp that is ""The Losers."" More importantly, it passes fun action movie rule number one: acknowledge your film is nothing more than a fun action movie.Just like the A-Team or any other group of specially trained individuals featured in TV or the movies, each member of The Losers has his own area of expertise. Jeffrey Dean Morgan plays Clay, the leader, Columbus Short as Pooch the large/explosive weapons specialist, Idris Elba as Roque the I honestly can't remember, Chris Evans as Jensen the techie with an awkward sense of humor and Oscar Jaenada as Cougar the sniper. Together, when a mysterious walkie-talkie voice named ""Max"" messes up their pre-opening credits mission and shoots down the helicopter they were supposed to be on, they go under the radar (aka everyone thinks they're dead).That's when they meet Zoe Saldana as Aisha, the beautiful but deadly woman that offers them a chance to get back in the United States and to find ""Max."" Hardly trusting her but left with few other choices, they agree. The story jumps from city to city and mission to mission without much set-up time in between. We also get a firsthand look at who Max is and that he's looking to purchase some new-age sonic weapons called ""snukes.""""The Losers"" plays out like a video game. Each scene follows a formula consisting of mission debriefing and/or scene where the characters argue over whether the mission is the right thing to do and then we go straight to the mission to watch the characters in action. There are a few scenes with Clay and Aisha, one being the only time hand-to-hand combat appears in the film (which is too bad, the scene looked and felt cool) and then there are some jumps over to the way Max crosses just about every man he works with. The film approaches him as some heartless classic television villain with an excessive sense of humor.The script keeps its wit about it, which is to say it wants to be funny and hardly is. Evans carries a lot of that weight as Jensen. His portrayal is thorough, but the character has some really bad writing behind him. Max is supremely unfunny, though it does work as a portrayal of a classic fictional villain.The pacing and cleverness of most of the action scenes makes ""Losers"" a good time. It would've been nice if not every big sequence ended in a poorly done CGI explosion (only a couple explosions appeared to be real stunt work) but the creative intent behind it was generally solid. The film and especially its script cuts a lot of corners, but respected writers Peter Berg and James Vanderbilt know exactly what they can't afford to cut if the film and its main characters are to stay relevant and though White is no master, he adds some respectable machismo and visual prowess to what's left.~Steven CVisit my site http://moviemusereviews.com",The Losers

Or more accurately, ex-soldiers that get betrayed after their latest mission and are almost killed in the process. Swearing revenge, they make their way back to homeland and start planning how to get even with their former boss.The film is based on a comic book of the same name by Andy Diggle and Jock, which definitely shows. The characters are all really extravagant and quirky, each with a clear set of characteristics and tropes attached to them. Which is the film's greatest strength. These are fun characters to follow around while they shoot people and blow stuff up. The villain started out a bit weak, but even he improved a lot towards the end, becoming a clear threat and someone you want to punch in the throat. Like a proper villain.As to the film's greatest weakness, I'd have to say the directing. To be more specific, Sylvain White, the director, is apparently a big fan of realistic war dramas. Which is an ill fit with the source material. There are numerous scenes where you can see White trying to be grim, dark and brooding, but then the film suddenly cracks a joke and goes back to the comic book antics. This creates a dissonant mood that's hard to reconcile.I was also not a fan of the sequel bait ending. This is not a huge franchise. You were unlikely to get another movie.

The strength lies in visual effects, chases, explosions - i.e. elements of a decent action thriller.

I liked Jeffrey Dean Morgan who seems to be channeling the tough guys of yesterday like John Wayne and Clint Eastwood. Zoe Saldana is also memorable, she and Morgan have great chemistry.

Maybe a hobo version of The A Team. I'm not knocking it for that alone – there's plenty of other things to knock it for – but I guess what I'm saying is that if you absolutely have to watch one movie about ex-soldiers framed for a crime they didn't commit and who are now on the lam and are awesome at everything, maybe you want the devil you know instead of The Losers.The Losers, named that for no particularly interesting reason, are a five-man band of good guys who get sold out while on a mission in Bolivia. Presumed dead, they aim to get back to the States, find the guy who done them wrong, and exact revenge. And giving them a hand in this noble, PG-13 endeavor is Aisha (Zoe Saldana), a butt kicker with a mysterious past – so rare in these movies – who has a score of her own to settle with The Bad Guy.The Bad Guy, by the way, is named Max and is played by Jason Patric, who once upon a time had a career. Anyone see him in Rush? He was pretty cool in that. Or Narc. But now he's just another generic, oily slimeball bad guy out to rule the world. It's not important how he plans to do this. All we need to know is that he'S unhinged, like a broken door or a bad simile. Patric's Max is a psychotic jerk, which makes it easy to root against him, but really – this isn't the kind of movie that has blurred lines of Good and Bad people.Leading the Losers is Clay (Jeffrey Dean Morgan), the Hannibal Smith of the crew. Then there's Jensen, the computer dude, played by Chris Evans; Cougar the sharpshooter, played by a taciturn Oscar Jaenada; and Pooch (Columbus Short) and Roque (Idris Elba). Roque is sort of the Mr. T, all muscles and hot headedness. Jensen is Face. And they're all Murdock.A lot of things blow up in this movie, to the point where, if you see something that resembles a three-dimensional object, you know it will likely blow up. Helicopters, cars, a plane, henchmen, it's all the same, really. And, true to action-movie rules, quintillions of bullets whiz by all of our heroes, even if they stand perfectly still, and hardly any of them are hit. And when they're hit, even if they're badly hurt, they somehow can keep on firing and walking/ambling around.On the plus side, each of the main actors brings a bit of personality and pizazz to his or her role, no matter how sketchily drawn it is. Everyone seems to be having a fun time, and why not? Even with all the RPGs and Uzis and whatnot, with death seemingly around every corner, these guys are all carefree, giddy as schoolboys. Jovial maiming is all the rage this year.And Saldana smolders as the Girl with Her Own Vendetta. She has one scene where she kicks the crap out of Jeffrey Dean Morgan, I suppose to establish her bona fides as a badass. But that's it as far as hand-to-hand combat goes for Aisha; she's a good shot, so she simply shoots people from then on out. Eh. I'd like to have seen more physical stuff from Saldana, but I'll takes what I can gets.The Losers does have its moments, and the action scenes suffice to keep it from being a worthless rehash of better films.

The soundtrack is excellent; and while the action scenes are a bit ridiculous, some of them are entertaining and fun. The dialogue is a bit uneven but there's some humor mixed in that's funny and keeps the film moving. Chris Evans was easily my favorite character, though Zoe was gorgeous as always.

36,Samiam3,About right,7,24 April 2010,"Though slightly juvenile for an action film, (hence the PG-13 rating) The Losers has wit, and that counts for something. The clichés are all there; the distraught hero, the girl with the gun, the dapper villain eager to get his hands on nuclear weapons, the geeky tech nerd, the bad-guy cops. The Losers frequently plays all this for laughs, it has a great sense of humour without which the film would be epically cheesy. There are some familiar faces in the cast, along with some new ones, and everyone seems to be having a good time, which helps us to have a good time.If I had to guess, I'd say it'd be Zoe Saldana which the studio values most for selling the product, which is kind of degrading. She may well be on the road to the Typecast city, until James Cameron gets Avatar 2 going. At least she can do her own stunts, something Megan Fox is probably incapable of. The best performance in the movie though is turned in by Jason Patric oddly enough, whose take on the clichéd super villain ready to wreak havoc with the push of a button, is perfect. There is no way anyone could take such a character seriously no why not goof it up a bit. The year is young but this guy is the Col. Hans Landa of 2010. Sometimes, the Losers doesn't work so good. At times it is just a little too unbelievable, especially the interplay between Saldana and Morgan, which is just gratuitous. So for an early blockbuster, The Losers delivers about what you'd expect.

His characters wardrobe and penchant for singing drew me in. The rest of the team are made up of your usual troupe. Experts in shooting/driving/computers etc. Patric is an amazing villain, he brightens up the scream with his camp evil. He's similar to Patrick Wilson's Lynch from the A-Team, but a lot more ruthless. He brings a few laughs to the table and has a wide range of perfectly timed facial expressions.

41,lemon_magic,Takes the clichés and runs with them to good effect,8,18 January 2011,"I approach movies adapted from graphic novels with trepidation, since it seems to be very difficult (not impossible, but difficult) to make comic dialog work in the mouths of real human beings, and some comics tropes just don't translate well to the big screen (at least for the adult viewer). Also weighing against it is the fact that the plot is essentially ""The A-team"" writ large and includes almost every hoary cliché from the thriller/spy genre in the last 30 years.But ""The Losers"" mostly meets and beats these difficulties by a) having an actual story arc with some interesting twists and turns, b) completely committing to the clichés (slo motion, jump cuts, explosions, firefights, etc) and executing them with admirable gusto and expertise, and c) having a bunch of fine (and good looking) actors deliver their lines with just the right combination of panache and world-weariness.The screenplay works pretty well, and only falters when it decides it has to have two ending codas;they're both good fun, but one or the other of the codas would have been enough and the movie ends up feeling like it didn't know when to end.Still, good fun all around, and Jason Patric proves he can invest even a cardboard super-villain with energy and pizazz.",The Losers

Then they see their helicopter hit with a missile, the kids are dead and they are suppose to be to. Now they must make their way back to the States in order to get their lives back and kill the one who set them up.The Losers is based on a comic of the same name. It was a limited issued series that I had never heard of, but after seeing the film, wouldn't mind checking out. The Losers is the type of action flick that surrounds itself with comedy and absurdity. You can't really take the things that happen seriously and the film knows this, it also pokes fun at itself. The Losers consist of Clay (Jeffery Dean Morgan) the leader, characterized by a guy who wears suits with no tie. Roque (Idris Elba) second in command and a hot head. Jensen (Chris Evans) who runs tech and is the comic relief. Pooch (Columbus Short) the driver and Cougar (Óscar Jaenada) the sniper expert. Each one has their own typical character trait, from rebel to wise-ass. The leader is obviously a troubled guy, who wants to do good and then you'll have your quite but deadly assassin. Nothing new by an means, but going in expecting this, I had a fun time. Zoe Saladana plays Aisha, the ass kicking chick who discovers they are hiding in Bolivia and offers them a chance to kill the guy who set them all up, Max (Jason Patrick). She tells them she will fund their operation as long as they get Max for her. Hmm, sounds like she has something of her own agenda. Can we trust her? We don't know, neither do they. But they have nothing else to lose right? The villain as I mentioned earlier is Jason Patrick, whose last memorable film was 2002's Narc. He doesn't have much of a résumé, so I kind of found it odd that he was the villain in this piece. I don't know how well he does comedy since it was pretty lacking here. You read that right, comedy. The villain is comedic and his routine is the straight face bit. His lines were delivered awkwardly for me and it really was an awkward performance. I kind of expected more action from this film, it doesn't wow you in anyway. The action sequences used are entertaining enough though, mainly because of who the characters are and what they do. Seeing Evans do some of the things seemed odd though, I didn't expect him to have much of an action background for his geek/tech character. Although it was interesting watching him with having Captain American on in the back of my mind. The Losers doesn't try to do anything new, instead it tries to simply entertain the audience that it is targeted at. To say this is a no brainer action film would fit it perfectly.There are some twists and turns in the plot that I personally didn't like. It makes sense, but for me I wanted things to turn out differently. I'm told that the same thing happens in the comic, but I didn't want the dynamic of the group to be changed. I found myself disappointed with that aspect. The use of music in points is odd, Journey pops up in one sequence that might be the most memorable part of the film. That scene alone should tell you that the film is not just an action junkie film, but for people that want to laugh. Can I recommend The Losers? I sure can, it seems to be getting beaten by the critics. I can see it from both sides of the looking glass. It's far from perfect and has a lot of things that would make people question it. Some of the comedy doesn't work, some people might not like the action sequences and again, the lead villain is odd. But I had a hell of a time watching it. The film is going to do very little business at the box office, mainly because there was no big name to draw people in and things that are based on anything that is not popular usually just has that small cult crowd. Kick-Ass was the victim of this last time, The Losers is the victim this time. I can totally see this film going into obscurity and no one remembering it.

43,lewiskendell,Mediocre action flick that could have been better with a little effort.,5,17 August 2010,"""I told you already. You die very badly.""To put it quite frankly, The Losers is a misfire. I'm haven't read the comic, so I can't compare its quality to the source material, but I can compare it to the many other action movies that have come before it. And that comparison leaves The Losers looking quite mediocre. It's the umpteenth movie about a person or team of soldiers who are betrayed and seek revenge, but that's not the problem I had with it. I don't expect action flicks to be narrative powerhouses, but I would like some characters that I care enough about to root for. With the great cast of actors you have here, including Idris Elba, Chris Evans, and Zoë Saldana, it's a shame that there's so little effort made at characterization. All of the protagonists are boring and paper thin, while the villain may be the lamest and most annoying that I've ever seen. He reminded me of a smart-mouthed 13 year-old more than anything else, and he was about as intimidating.The action was okay, but far from intense or interesting. That's because the bad guys were just incompetent fodder for the good guys to mow down, and never seemed much of a threat. Not in a way that made our heroes seem like powerhouses, but in a way that made it appear that the villain found all his underlings in the reject pile.    A good action movie needs more than a lot of shooting and brief mentions of family back home as the heroes' motivation. The Losers may not be outright bad, but it's certainly forgettable and uninspired. I actually hope that the sequel this movie blatantly sets up actually gets made, just so another attempt can be made to make a movie that's as good as this cast deserves.",The Losers
44,Chase_Witherspoon,"I came, I saw, I lost",1,6 June 2012,"An oblivion more epic in its failure than the desire of the central villain to create a chain reaction of terror that will lead to world domination, but, foiled by the aptly titled ""Losers"". Jason Patric is the lead villain - Max - an unscrupulous corporate type craving more importance than he receives and rightly deserves. The guy who dies to Snow Patrol on ""Grey's Anatomy"" (Morgan) is the uber-cool, ""I wear Armani suits sans neck tie"" Special Forces leader who's double crossed on a jungle mission, but returns from the dead with his rag-tag mercenaries to avenge their mistreatment.There's a couple more double-crosses and a frenetic shoot-out where one of the commandos is shot in both legs, but still manages to take out a dozen bad guys, scale a tall building and arrive just in time for the birth of his first child. Some other reviewers have lauded the comic-book texture applied to the credits, but as it doesn't feature anywhere in the actual movie, it's difficult to see how it adds value.The stunt work and pyrotechnics are loud, audacious and primed for maximum explosiveness; the characters too are precocious, smart-alec types and the movie just doesn't know when to ease up on the sarcasm. Point in fact, just when you thought it couldn't get any worse because it had ostensibly ended, there's an ill conceived post-script with Chris Evans' character remonstrating with the stocky female referee at his niece's soccer match, as his cool-mint mates suavely interject to save him from embarrassment - oops, too late. A cringe-worthy waste of time.",The Losers
45,brando647,Leave Your Brain on Idle and Watch the Action Erupt...,6,18 August 2010,"I had never heard of Vertigo's comic series before sitting down to watch this movie, so I couldn't tell you whether or not the film stays true to the source material. All I knew was that it was an action film and it's cast was enough to get me interested. I wish it was better, and I tried to enjoy it for what it was but THE LOSERS was pretty dull in my opinion. The film follows an ex-Special Forces team led by Clay (Jeffrey Dean Morgan) that is betrayed on a mission to South America by a mysterious figure known only as Max (Jason Patric). Left for dead, the team remains quiet in South America until they're approached by a woman of questionable intent, Aisha (Zoe Saldana) who offers them a chance to reclaim their old lives and get vengeance on Max.The cast was probably the only thing I really enjoyed about this movie. Morgan is a great tough guy, and that's all that's really required for this role. Clay refuses to give up on the chance to bring Max down and all Morgan really needs to do here is brood in every scene. Zoe Saldana, fresh off of AVATAR, kicks some serious butt and proves she's can be action film material without CGI enhancement when she gets the chance. Chris Evans is the best as Jenson, the team's communications and tech specialist. He's hilarious and I loved his solo outing when his character is chased through a high rise to Journey's ""Don't Stop Believin'"". The rest of the team are fun enough, I just wish the villain wasn't so lame. Jason Patric is Max, an arrogant man who kills for whatever reason he sees fit no matter how minor. The character of Max comes off as so smarmy and immature that he aggravates me in every scene he's in. Not in that ""oh, he's so evil I can't wait until he gets what's coming to him"" way...more like ""I want to punch that punk in the face every time he opens his mouth"".While on the topic of Max, what exactly is he supposed to be? Corrupt government operative? Drug lord? Crime boss? It never really explains. We just know he has money and likes to do bad things...such as purchasing some environmentally friendly nuclear weapons that can somehow implode an island into the ocean. It's never really explained, just that he wants to aggravate the US through terrorist attacks. If it is explained, they don't spend much time on it. That's more time we'd have to wait until the next explosion...In all honesty though, you know what you're in for from the first sequence when it ends in a short bus escaping from a massive explosion. So it's not like the film doesn't warn you up front. I suppose if you aren't looking for substance and just want a fun action film, this could be just what you need. It's got loads of action, plenty of humor, and a ridiculous climax. The film sets itself up for a sequel but, based on how well it did in the box office, we may never get to see it. So, leave your brain on idle and just enjoy the film for what it is.",The Losers
46,Troy_Campbell,Stock-standard action.,4,4 June 2010,"Why do we not see Jason Patric on the big screen more often? His completely-bonkers villain, Max, is a hilariously whimsical and unhinged character that runs away with The Losers. Which is a huge credit to Patric, although – seeing as Max is possibly the fourth or fifth most important player in the movie – it doesn't shine a very positive light on the filmmakers and other actors.Fresh from the critical acclaim he received as the tortured Comedian in Watchmen, Morgan seems out of place as top Loser Clay. He just doesn't fit the 'wise leader' mould; his tough, scraggy exterior and mumbling tones more suited to a supporting part further down the chain of command. Elba is all rough-and-rumble as right hand man Roque but lacks the charisma that made him the standout in gritty HBO drama The Wire. Rounding out a disappointing hat trick, Saldana's seductive, rocket-launcher firing Aisha isn't actually all that seductive and, most embarrassingly, has zero chemistry with Morgan. The reliably humorous Evans and the aforementioned underrated Patric are left to clean things up however they can only do so much when they're not part of the lead trio.With a terrifically high-adrenaline opening scene it feels like we're in for one hell of a ride, unfortunately it all patters away into stock-standard action and boring clichés from there. Director White aims for Kick-Ass style fun yet never tries anything out of the ordinary. The overly familiar comic-book decorations that come with the proceedings are old and tired whilst the vacillating level of violence (an R-rated premise toned down to M) is simply annoying. The locale-jumping plot is average at best, the twists aren't particularly shocking and the ambiguous ending shouts ""sequel"". Although with this film barely making it's meagre $25m budget back at the box office, I wonder if we'll ever get to see another instalment. No big loss if we don't.2 out of 5 (1 - Rubbish, 2 - Ordinary, 3 - Good, 4 - Excellent, 5 - Classic)",The Losers

Somehow though this movie is serious lacking in true thrills. And this can be said of many action movies made these last years. This movie is proof of the fact that there are no more real action heroes like in the eighties who could deliver. Say all you want about Stallone and Schwarzenegger. They knew how to intensify the action on the screen. Don't get me wrong,""The Losers"" is on OK movie,but it could have been so much more. And I am not speaking of plot. For me the action has to speak for itself. A good story is always a bonus. The action didn't impress that much. Just when I thought that things would get intense the scene is stopped and the action is over. And the shaky camera was really out of place here. How can one enjoy the action when you can hardly keep up with what is going on. I may seem very critical but that is because I had higher expectations. ""The Losers"" is enjoyable because of the lovable (but very flat) characters and some decent action. Nothing more nothing less!",The Losers
49,oneguyrambling,Who thought it was a good idea to release an A Team rip at the same time the A Team came out?,5,29 November 2010,"I put off dealing with this film for a week now, basically because it is crap. But also because prior to this film screening there were the obligatory previews, one of them was for the A-Team, which got me thinking ""Ten years ago , a crack commando unit was sent to prison by a military court for a crime they didn't commit. These men promptly escaped from a maximum security stockade to the Los Angeles underground. Today, still wanted by the government, they survive as soldiers of fortune. If you have a problem, if no one else can help, and if you can find them, maybe you can hire The A-Team."" Now let's compare, just for fun.""A while back a crack military unit was framed for a crime they didn't commit. After mistakenly being thought dead they lie low in the South American underground. Today, still wanted by the government, they survive as a pack of idiots. Zoe Soldana has a problem, no one else can help, and she has found them, maybe she will team up with The Losers."" Well as long as we are all agreed that the above doesn't sound like a generic rip off released in a poorly timed manner I believe we can move on.I think the ideal target audience for The Losers have short attention spans, low standards and high pain thresholds. Therefore the rest of this review is in bullet point form.The action is: - Heavily stylised but not really very violent.Perplexing. People are killed for laughs by the bad and good guys, yet sometimes we are expected to care and other times we apparently needn't.Full of hackneyed tactics and tricks, (Woosh, ""I'm jumping away from an explosion!"") - Hurried up for plot over logic, Top Secret stuff is accessed and downloaded in the seconds.Full of slo-mo, freeze-frame and even on screen cartoonery.The Losers are: - Well muscled and immaculately coiffed.Macho and wise crackin' even in the middle of a firefight.Brave and laugh in the face of danger, (again cracking terrible jokes all the while.) - Ethical, they'll disobey orders to ""do the right thing"".Video game characters, judging by the fact that one shot in the leg can get up and run after being bandaged up. Yay health packs!! ""Seriously, I've seen it. Shoot me."" Jason Patric is: - An accomplished actor with a solid CV over many decades.Obviously in dire need of cash to ham his way through this dreck as the bad guy.Zoe Soldana is: - Hot, but somehow hotter when she was 9 ft tall and blue.Down to her undies a couple times in the film.Only in the film because of the two points above.And there were multiple scenes with American flags flapping in the background, I don't mean in the distance, I mean the whole screen had a Stars and Stripes backdrop. If this was to distract from how bad this is I understand, as many ""US Americans"" might not want to appear unpatriotic by booing anything with the flag in full view. (Seriously I had no idea the flag was in the background of the cast shot until I put the review up!) They should.Final Rating – 5.5 / 10. So very unnecessary and annoyingly average. I didn't (and don't) think the A Team will be much chop, but it would need to suck right royal to be worse than this and they set things up for a sequel?!?If you liked this review (or even if you didn't) check out oneguyrambling.com",The Losers

When they are betrayed by an enemy named Max, they become fugitives and are believed to be dead. They are forced to team up with a mysterious woman named Aisha who may be able to help them find Max. I understand this movie is based on a comic book by Vertigo, but I never read any, so I couldn't compare it. My favorite character was Chris Evans as Jensen, because he had all the hilarious lines.

I don't have anything great to say about the movie except some of the scenes in the movie were decent action sequences, keeping up the thrills moving.
What did not work:
I think everything else failed miserably; acting, directing, editing and the screenplay. It has a very poor narrative, often moving in no direction, lazy dialogues and bad quality storytelling. It's like a B grade action movie without any motive, strong plot or mission. Everyone acted bad, or maybe were casted wrong. The protagonist and antagonist both lack the depth of their presence in their character. The tech guy, supposed to be funny, is not at all funny. Some final sequences has very poor vfx quality, making it feel like a low budget movie. The action sequences are not well choreographed or edited. The use of racial and cultural stereotypes is another let down. The biggest let down is that the movie is so pretentious, lame and underperformed that you feel like you are watching a movie without any substance. The actors seemed to be running around, fighting and making statements that doesn't make sense as a movie. There are many plotholes, unanswered questions and cliche scenes, making you want the movie to end.

59,latinfineart,"Incredibly awful - if you like cartoons, you might like this movie",1,31 July 2017,"I hated this movie. I tend to dislike movies that require me to take cartoon type, leaps of faith, which this required every few minutes. It felt like they were making it specifically for 8-13 year olds. It could have been good. The cast was decent. Jeffrey Dean Morgan is always good. But, the direction was poor, the stunts were stupid, and the entire story as inane. Where the genre-refreshing Kick-Ass' introduces you to a spunky 11 year-old superhero you can't get enough of, Zoe's Aisha feels more like a worn-out retread right out of the Hollywood action flick recycle bin. The same can be said for the rest of this tired production, from the lame-brained plot to the cheesy f/x to the sloppy stunt work to the profusion of cartoonish, one-dimensional characters. Saldana is really wasted here. As is Morgan, and Patric. And Elba? My oh my. It was the Nicolas Cage school of reading scripts. How much? OK, I will take it. The story opens in the jungles of Bolivia where a team of U.S. Special Forces commandos led by Colonel Clay (Jeffrey Dean Morgan) are on assignment to bring a drug kingpin (Peter Francis James) to justice. The other members of the elite squad include getaway car driver/daredevil pilot Pooch (Columbus Short), ruthless, money-hungry Rogue (Idris Elba), computer hacker Jensen (Chris Evans) and sharpshooting sniper Cougar (Oscar Jaenada).The operation goes horribly wrong when their helicopter is hit by a rocket-propelled grenade and explodes into smithereens while hovering in midair. Fortunately, instead of Clay and his unit riding inside, the chopper was filled with 25 orphans they had altruistically arranged to airlift to safety.Realizing that they've just been betrayed by a mole inside the CIA, the quintet opts to make believe they actually did perish in the air disaster. Trusting no one, other than Aisha (Saldana), the mysterious temptress who materializes out of nowhere to seduce Clay, they proceed to track the shadowy figure (Jason Patric) they suspect was behind the attempted hit.That trail takes the gun-toting globetrotters from Bogota to such ports of call as Miami, Puerto Rico, Houston, Mumbai and Los Angeles. The film indulges in an array of high body-count shootouts and poorly-shot pyrotechnic displays en route to the totally predictable finale.Don't expect to see anything special in this under-budgeted homage to bad B-movies. Unfortunately, the outdated special effects employed here, like an exploding, green screen fireball everybody manages to keep one step ahead of, render the movie more laughable than suspenseful.

A seasoned colonel special ops officer betrayed by his employer causes the colonel to get exacting revenge, but falls short of sweet victory. Jason Patric as the psychotic Max was excellent in his portrayal of the diabolical mastermind of attaining the most powerful weapons on the planet. With the added bonus of Aisha played by (Zoe Saldana) who wants revenge on the colonel for killing her father during a mission where Max betrays him. This twist of emotions with a betrayer in the ranks among the colonels men gives us a look at how most do not stop in the face of their own deaths. The colonel (Jeffrey Morgan) is that kind of person, using his wits and muscle to stop his nemesis, and to erase his ex man (roque) who thought going into missions was a waste of time.

It's filled with guns, girls, cars, explosions, fists, legs, knives, motorcycles, in fact almost anything but the kitchen sink. The actors seem to be having fun in their roles as the chemistry between the six leads show, but Jason Patric looks like he's having a terrific time, chewing every scene he's in and giving us what may be the funniest (although sometimes annoying) villain in years.The film has it's action packed moments and plenty of laugh-out loud moments, but that's about what you can expect from a movie like this. Don't expect anything like ""Shutter Island"" or ""Slumdog Millionaire"" and you'll do just fine.

There's never a dull moment in the film, not thanks to the story or the writing, but thanks to the energetic and exuberant cast that surrounds this film. Chris Evans plays Jensen, the computer nerd, and he has an amazingly, scene-stealing funny scene. Idris Elba plays Roque, and Jeffrey Dean Morgan plays Clay, and these two constantly go at it. Zoe Saldana continues her streak of simultaneously being a great actress and being super sexy playing a mysterious woman named Aisha. Jason Patric, so calm in My Sister's Keeper, gives a wonderfully gonzo, wacky, and over the top performance as the bad guy, Max. Although the character of Max is not nearly mean or crazy enough to pull off a believable bad guy, Patric gives him a great edge. The story of The Losers is not anything thrilling or intriguing, it's just The A-Team with 5 guys, but the actors enhance the execution far beyond what I would have expected anyone to do. The film's humor is hilarious, and the action scenes allow the audience to take time to laugh at one hilarious joke before laughing at another. Evans is really the backbone of everything funny is this film, and Morgan knows his comic book movies after playing The Comedian in Watchmen.

70,Quebec_Dragon,"Not a winner, not a loser, and it doesn't tie either.",5,11 December 2011,"The Losers is loosely based on a modern action/thriller comic book series that took its name from World War II comic characters published in the 60s/70s. It actually doesn't matter as you don't need to have read anything to understand. I read the first graphic novel years before the movie and found it pretty average and forgettable, or more accurately a nice concept not very well done. The same could basically be said about the movie. So, this is a military/spy action movie that doesn't take itself too seriously, but also doesn't devolve into parody except for the goofy main villain, Max. He's entertaining in a b-movie way, but certainly not believable. As others pointed, it has similarities to the A-Team TV series, but with the addition of your kick ass female member.A bunch of special operations military working for the CIA survive an assassination attempt in Bolivia by their own side. They pass themselves off as dead, want to return to the USA and take revenge. Why they were targeted in the first place is pretty much glossed over as well as any psychological consequences. There's not much of a plot, and they're not called ""Losers"" at any time during the movie. We have instead a series of ""missions"" intersped with a couple of bedroom fights. The mêlée fights were done well enough, they didn't overstay their welcome, and I liked them. The other action scenes were competent but not outstanding. They fell somewhere in-between b-movie low-budget fare and big blockbuster fare. There were several attempts by the director to be stylish in his filming (witness the slow-motions, the zooming, the comics panels, the staccato cutting with the music beat), but it feels like a grab bag taken from better films instead of a consistent art direction. Still, it was visually nice to watch and the pace was fast yet understandable.There were attempts at wit in the writing that usually weren't great, but it kept the general tone light. Chris Evans (playing the talkative techno-nerd) was the acting highlight for me, especially his ""infiltration"" of the villain's business HQ that was mostly fun and funny. The main attraction, Zoe Saldana, handled the physical aspect of the role well, but didn't convince me much otherwise. A big flaw for me was characters being injured and being mostly OK a few scenes afterwards. It should be also be noted that my appreciation went down as I neared the end because of the silliness and the way things were left open for a sequel that will never come and wouldn't deserve to happen. Things didn't feel properly tied up. You could do much worse if you want a not-too-serious action movie rental, and especially if you used to like the A-Team.

76,colinrgeorge,A Surface-Level Film Polished to a Gleam,6,4 May 2010,"""The Losers"" playfully posits an ironic title, but under release by Dark Castle Entertainment, it became something of a self-fulfilling prophecy. Their marketing for this comic-book action throwback was sparse at best, and internet enthusiasm walked the line of virtual nonexistence despite a trailer no more corny than that of the wildly-anticipated new Iron Man film.But without the advertising oomph of a superhero sequel, moviegoers were quick to hypocritically label ""The Losers"" 'stupid,' while salivating over Sylvester Stallone's upcoming ""Expendables."" Like that film, ""The Losers"" embraces the disposable entertainment it was inspired by, and all of the popcorn fun and narrative pitfalls that entails. Title cards splash flamboyantly across the opening scene, introducing us to our protagonists via nickname and destructive area of expertise. These colorful freeze-frames are perfect snapshots of the one- dimensional cartoon characters the film is populated by; in thirty seconds we understand their clichéd team dynamic, and the lame plot wheelbarrows forward.And you know what? I kind of like it that way. I'll gladly take 'stupid' over pretentious, and ""The Losers"" doesn't get hung up on whether or not it's going to inspire conversation on the ride home. Instead, it sets up a premise and executes it point blank: the story is your typical connect-the-dots of entertaining but unremarkable action sequences, whose best quality is probably legibility. Thank your deity of choice that they're not cut like ""Transformers 2,"" which is maybe a necessity of shooting at an eighth of Michael Bay's budget, but even with a comparative shoestring and seldom a spark of originality, ""The Losers"" wins hands down in the comprehensibility department—And it's a movie where motorcycles can and will fly into airplane turbines.It's actually the comic-book stuff—The flourishes ""The Losers"" hopes to distinguish itself by —That come off feeling superfluous and out of place in the heat of the action. I know it's based on a graphic novel (even though I'd hitherto never heard of it), but I gotta tell ya, Ang Lee's ""Hulk,"" isn't the best style manual for making the jump to the big screen. Freeze frames, artificial zooms, and drawing on the image is ugly and distracting.Fortunately, that stuff really isn't a huge issue. I'll cope because the most important aspect of the film—Its cast—Is fun to watch play off each other. They share a convincing rapport that transcends how surface-level gimmicky their roles are; you have the tough-as-nails leader (Jeffrey Dean Morgan), the romantically-challenged computer nerd (Chris Evans), the beefy black guy (Idris Elba), and the token sex appeal (Zoe Saldana). They breathe life into otherwise decomposing archetypes, and have a great time doing it.The bottom line is that though ""The Losers"" fails to distinguish itself in all the important ways, stapled to a hopelessly generic plot with nary an innovative action set-piece or idea, it actually excels at the status quo. It isn't crippled by its clichés, it wears them as semi-ironic badges of honor. After all, when else will you see a caricatural evil genius (Jason Patric) taken to the comedic absurd of blowing a hole in the head of his parasol-toting assistant for letting his shade wander?A more pronounced tongue-in-cheek sensibility might have taken the film to another level, but as it stands, director Sylvain White polishes this very surface film to a fine gleam. It's just a shame that some imaginary line's been drawn between it and the undisputed summer heavyweights, because a quick glance back at what made money last year makes abundantly clear that ""The Losers"" is rarely one-upped in intellect.It may be 'stupid,' but it's more than that. ""The Losers"" is stupid fun.",The Losers

78,blacklist-1,Silly undemanding fun,6,28 May 2010,"The Losers as a film isn't quite a loser but it isn't a winner and more at a tie break in terms of how and good and bad this film is. It is a good trashy fun film with most of the acting being bad though Zoe Salanda (last seen in Avatar) acts reasonable and makes a lasting impression on her acting and visually. Jason Patric is a funny villain and makes it entertaining, the visuals as well like the camera work was creative and the action well co-ordinated and exciting, particularly the action climax. the music I also really like with some great soundtracks and their are funny moments too. It's clear director Sylvain White is a visuals director.But unfortunately most of the acting is bad particularly from Jeffery Morgan who played Clay (the main character) with thin characters whom you don't really care about, a predictable story and very cheesy script, which I laughed at , but the good thing is the actors revel in and take the script for what it is.

80,Benjamin_Cox,More of a score-draw than a rout - 69%,7,3 April 2013,"According to my IMDb profile (which I've only just managed to look at and an excellent feature it is too), nearly half the movies I've ever written about have been action flicks. No real surprise there - Hollywood continues to produce action films with startling regularity, each one with bigger explosions and more bullets than the last. But despite the shallowness, I confess that a good action movie can provide all the escapism and entertainment I demand even if my life hasn't been vastly improved as a whole. This movie was another one that piqued my interest with the trailer and like most action movies, it does enough to entertain without really stretching the medium as a whole.In deepest Bolivia, a CIA Special Forces team are assigned to take out a nasty drug baron but try to abort the air-strike after spotting children being used as human shields. But their superior, a voice on the radio known as Max (Jason Patric), demands the mission be completed. Ignoring orders, they soon find themselves becoming a target for the CIA themselves and they quickly disappear off the radar for a while. So when team leader Clay (Jeffrey Dean Morgan) is contacted by an alluring woman (Zoe Saldana) with a plan to get them home and armed to the teeth for revenge, Clay soon persuades his colleagues Pooch (Columbus Short), Roque (Idris Elba), Cougar (Óscar Jaenada) and Jensen (Chris Evans) to join him. But can she really be trusted as the Losers soon find that Max has bigger fish to fry than a rag-tag bunch of apparently deceased soldiers? Based on a comic series, ""The Losers"" feels remarkably like a slightly more humorous take on ""Wanted"". The film is crammed with slow-mo shots of explosions, gun battles and carnage erupting around the actors as they shoot, blow up and kung-fu-kick their way to the film's (faintly anti-climatic) final sequence. As a result, there isn't a great deal for them to do but Evans and Morgan do well, snapping off wise-cracks amid the chaos. Saldana, however, does her career a power of good - being the perfect blend of sexy chick and bad-ass heroine (which reminds me, I must watch ""Columbiana""). The story doesn't really do much besides provide a variety of locales for each action sequence to take place although the stuff about Max's overall plan involving bizarre 'green' bombs is clearly nonsense. But the action is satisfying enough and isn't that what we want from an action pic?True enough but ""The Losers"" fails to recognise a basic principal of action movies - context. Take ""The Matrix"", the spiritual basis for every action movie since (including this one) - would Neo's bullet dodging have meant as much if the story hadn't gripped us from the opening scene, that memorable chase over rooftops between Trinity and Agent Smith? ""The Losers"" can't make its mind up whether its a revenge story or whether there is a classic 'evil genius' story going on instead and as a result, it isn't as tense as it could have been. The humour also prevents tension building, although it makes the film more entertaining than ""Wanted"" which took itself way too seriously. Action fans would do well to watch this and personally, I'm looking forward to any sequel although judging by the film's poor box-office performance, that looks unlikely. It's not a bad film but one that just needed a bit less pyrotechnics and a bit more thought to it. Frustrating because I really wanted to like this more than I do.",The Losers
81,cadillac20,A Passable Time At The Theater with Some Great Acting,6,23 April 2010,"Seeing the trailer for this film, I sort of anticipated a film that wasn't all that great, but it looked like fun. Sure enough, The Losers is a fun time at the theater, but it lacks so much that you can't help but feel it could have been much better. Everything about it is good, it just lacks so much ambition that it remains a passable film that will most likely just take up a good chunk of your time. It's time well spent, but nothing memorable. The film follows a group of five elites in service of their country who are betrayed during a mission and declared dead. Many years later, they are approached with the job of a lifetime: find and kill the one who betrayed them. If you've seen the trailers, you kind of know not to expect a film that boasts much in the way of the logical. There are a large number of plot holes, but logic doesn't fall into this films list of qualities anyways. The best part of the film is it's ensemble, which not only works well together, but makes the film as entertaining as it is. Of particular note is Chris Evans, who provides most of the comic relief but also seems to be the only one who really gets it and plays up the over-the-top-ishness to perfection. Jeffrey Dean Morgan and Zoe Saldana also stand out, but they could have pushed things a bit further. The film also boasts some good direction and a few well produced action sequences, particularly one in Miami involving a high caliber machine gun and a number of explosions. Unfortunately, the film didn't go as far as it needed to to be a true summer blockbuster. The action isn't nearly explosive enough or exciting enough to be all that memorable. While it is fairly entertaining, it's also heavily clichéd. It tries to be cooler than it really is, and it makes for a bit of a yawning affair. Had the production tried to shoot for less nostalgia of action flicks of yesteryear and tried to be a bit more ambitious, I think it would have been more entertaining. The story is also quite lackluster and typical. There are no surprises, almost every twist is predictable, and the climax and ending are a joke. I realize it is a film based on a graphic novel, but even so, it lacks anything really novel or exciting. What we mostly get is some meh followed by a bit more meh.The performances certainly save the film, and they are good enough to hold it up and make it an enjoyable couple hours, but when the film is over don't be surprised to forget about it. Well, with the exception of Chris Evans musical turn. That should get some chuckles. Don't think I will ever see him and not think of Journey again.",The Losers

It assembles an appealing cast where everyone has something clever or funny to say. Is there a story? Well, it turns out there is, but you might not notice it because the film moves along so fast and so well. There are often exciting shootouts and fights. This action film is by the numbers, still, it borrows the most entertaining parts from action films that came before and combines them into one irresistible package. Surprisingly, the script is well-written. The black comedy comes often, and the scenery is worth mentioning, taking place in several countries.

83,SeriousJest,Comic-book-style A-Team-meets-Smokin'-Aces,6,2 January 2012,"This flick is a comic-book-style version of The A-Team-meets-Smokin' Aces. The cast of protagonists is outstanding; they're funny (especially Chris Evans, whose ""Don't Stop Believin'"" rendition makes me want to have a Rock Band jam session with him; go Petunias!) and bad- ass, like watching a beer commercial about mercs. The script is action- packed, with witty dialogue; the special effects are often exciting; the combat scenes are hard-core (and Saldana even makes hers sexy); the soundtrack is awesome; and the camera work adds just the right accent to the many adrenaline rushes. All of that being said, there was one key action scene that was so ridiculous that it actually made me turn from the screen and say, ""Oh, c'mon!""–not because it was improbable, but because it was impossible and simply silly. Additionally, I usually like Jason Patric as an actor, but I hated him in this role as Max. I couldn't figure out which one was worse: the quality of his scripted lines (it was almost as if this role had its own writer, with half of the talent of the guy who wrote for the other characters) and over-the- top nature of his character, or his goofy delivery, which seemed like a tech geek trying to play a hardcore CIA agent. All in all, this is not necessarily a movie that I recommend you make the time to see, but if you've got some down time and are looking for some fast-paced action with some witty and comedic dialogue, I'd highly prefer this film over similar movies like The A-Team. The Losers is a fun ride that requires and inspires little thinking.",The Losers
84,ciscokid1970,A Great War Buddy flick,8,24 May 2010,"This was a pretty damn good movie. Has a slight from comic book feel to it but stands on its own. Good fun to watch, the kind of buddy group movie that inspires the ""I got your back"" mentality. If you liked The Dirty Dozen, Magnificent Seven or even A Teamthen you will dig this movie. Kind of flew in under the radar, but certainly worth watching again. As always for movies I like I try not to give much away but some compliments below. Only minimal sex, drugs and foul languageso it I say OK for over 13, there is plenty of violence.I liked that the movie was filled with lesser known stars (compliment not a insult) because I think the actors were less pressured and allowed the characters to form into them. Jeffrey Dean Morgan was brilliant again. Zoe Saldana was hot and even though she is thin...she made believable tuff chick. Oscar Jaenada and Chris Evans also really kicked butt in their parts.Impressed with this work from Peter Berg. Berg has had a lot of secondary parts and really developed in TV show Chicago Hopebut his writing in Friday Night Lights has really brought him into the complete actor/writer/producer element. His writing in this movie was brilliant, never slowed down, good character development, and some nice twists.Catch it at matinée or buy a used copy and watch it with the guys.",The Losers

I must say, i was really disappointed on that matter. Not because she's not good looking but because i didn't see her naked as i thought i will. :) I can't say i was exactly disappointed by the movie it self since my expectations were way too low to be able to be disappointed, but let's just say that i wasn't surprised either. The cast was basically good except for Jason Patric. This is his worst performance so far. He's never been this bad. Not that he's bad usually but... Fuc*ing irritating would be the most gentle way to explain how bad he was. The remaining of the cast was good. I guess the bright moments of the movie were Zoe Saldana and, as always, excellent Jeffrey Dean Morgan.Direting is one of the main flaws of this film.

87,s_campanale,A loving tribue to trash genre cinema that doesn't always hit the mark,6,30 May 2010,"A big problem with many summer blockbusters is that after months (sometimes years) of build up and hype you finally enter the cinema with such enormous expectations that no matter how good what you see is it will always feel like an anti-climax. Not so ""sleeper"" movies like this one. I don't think anyone goes to a film like this expecting the second coming, maybe just some entertainment for a Saturday night. That is pretty much what THE LOSERS is. As many have said it is a very uneven film that looks as if it was made as a team effort by four or five different people all with a completely different take on what the end product should look like. It could be trying to go all the way into in your face wackiness, like say BITCH SLAP or NINJA ASSASSIN, but the unbelievable Pg13 (12a in the UK) certificate stops it from ever taking off. A lot of scenes misfire, especially the end - Never has a near apocalypse seemed so utterly banal and unimportant! The supposed horror at the massacre of 25 kids (with teddy bear) and the desire for revenge seems as burning as two hour old coffee! And don't get me started on the dreaded ""homage to the moral supremacy of the family man"" slush that often gets forced uncomfortably into these movies (You have a FAMILY man! You can't die! Him over there, he ain't married and he ain't got no kids so *&^%$ him! Who cares if he dies, he ain't A FAMILY MAN!!His life is worthless!)It also seems to assume you are gonna absolutely love all these guys when a little effort to win this love would have helped. However it is interesting in being part of a growing trend towards ""retro"" style actioners now that the Tarantino effect enters it's third decade and new young film makers will have grown up with trash cinema as a serious and valuable art form worthy of homage and study. Indeed, it's loose plot and poorly sketched comic villains seem almost to have come from a 1960's psychedelic spy adventure (Jason Patric certainly evokes the likes of Dirk Bogarde in MODESTY BLAISE) so it might be deliberate. Zoe Saldana's character (Libyan?) is also good, but her story arc with Clay seemed VERY familiar from that of a certain Russian Agent XXX who fought against then worked with and fell in love with a certain British spy who she accidentally discovered had killed her lover at the start of the film and vowed to kill him once the mission was over but of course didn't. (SPY WHO LOVED ME for non Bond fans) When she was waving her gun at Clay a couple of times near the end I could have sworn she was going to say ""Zen ven zis Mission hiss over, I vill kill YOO!"" Mind you all of this could have been in the comic book already - sadly not having read it it is hard to make a detailed comparison. The end result is forgettable and most likely will make no impact on popular culture nor be remembered in any way. but it is a fun night out at the cinema and a loving homage to genre cinema and television of the past so it can be considered a success!",The Losers

90,lopcar1993,"""The Losers"" aren't losers after all...",8,26 April 2010,"When Alex Proyas adapted the independent comic book ""The Crow"" to the screen it was one of the few and the only other big comic book adaptation of the 90's. The other being the widely popular Batman films that came out from 1992-1997(One directed by Tim Burton, two directed by Joel Schumacher.) but since ""The Crow"" massive commercial and critical success no other independent comic book has stepped up to the plate to fill the shoes ""The Crow"" left behind. That is until a little know director Sylvain White and his writers Peter Berg James Vanderbilt adapted for the screen an extremely little know comic book published by Vertigo X tentatively called ""The Losers "". While this film may seem like another A-Team let, you tell you right now that you have never meet a team quite like ""The Losers.Sylvain White's hilarious and audacious comic book adaptation is a work of art, well it is more like a grunge band song mixed with some good old action values, and revenge is a dish best severed cold. This film dish out some seriously cold justice to the baddies with ultra style and flare although films like ""The Losers"" lost there following at the end of the 90's. director Sylvain White knows this and while he has knowledge that some will not take kindly to a throwback action film, others will embrace it with open arms feeling nostalgic for the days of ""FACE/OFF""(1997) and ""Die Hard""(1989) and all the other great action films of the 80's and 90's. Some may find ""The Losers"" well a loser and others will find it to be an extravagant and very well executed action comedy with some serious intellect, it's the kind of film that is just too good to resist and even harder to hate.What I like most about ""The Losers"" is the care that was taken into telling the story it is quite well crafted and played out on screen, how all the characters seem to bounce jokes and witty dialogue off of each other. It gave the film a sense that these group of actors had worked together many times before and know how each other tick and that to me is something special it gives the film a better more buddy, buddy type feel instead of a stark military action picture type feel. What makes it feel this way is the joke filled script by Peter Berg and James Vanderbilt they lay on the jokes, the charm, the cool hip vibe and the intelligence to make this action picture stand out amongst the crowd, while it may not seem like ""The Losers"" should work, it does. It is an action film I am proud to say that I laughed so hard it hurt and was completely riveted by this film.The well know ensemble cast including Jeffery Dean Morgan, Idris Elba, Zoë Saldana, Chris Evans, Columbus Short, Oscar Jaendada, Holt McCallany and Jason Patric(who this film could have seriously done without.) deliver fine performances in a film that is better than it should be and allot more keen and intelligent than we would have thought. There performances that including Chris Evans, Jeffery Dean Morgan and Zoë Saldana are three that must work so that the others can survive if any of theses three fail than the whole film comes crashing down with the rest of the cast. It is only to them and the quick-witted script that this flawed but extremely worthy film can gain that title, it succeeds on the actor alone.This film is not perfect it has its flaws and has its holes but the holes in this film are relatively minor ones that you do not really notice unless you are looking for them. From an action fans viewpoint this film is everything you could hope for in an action picture, and I know I have said that a few times but for some films it is mostly true and for ""The Losers"" it is spot on. I will admit that there were some moments where I questioned this films intention and then someone cracked a joke pr something very intriguing happened and I suddenly did not care anymore. It is a throwback essentially, a throwback to the days when films were entertainment and not super intelligent, scientifically accurate like all films must be today or they will rip it up and burn it. ""The Losers"" doesn't care it's here to entertain and give you some good laughs with your explosions along the way and if your forgiving I can promise you ""The Losers"" will deliver.",The Losers
91,garyvanhorn,The Losers gives comic book movies a bad name.,2,11 January 2011,"The Losers is based on a comic book of the same name. I like comics, but have never picked up this title, and if this movie is any indication of the quality of the comic, it seems my decision was a wise one. The Losers alternated annoying me and then boring me, but I persevered and finished watching the film, hopefully you won't have to.The film begins in Bolivia, where our heroes, a macho black ops team, has just targeted an evil drug lord's compound for a bombing run. Suddenly a bus load of innocent children pulls up, teddy bears and all, and the heroes try to call off the attack. They are overridden by a mysterious voice that identifies himself as Max, who coldly states ""I knew they would be there"". See how evil that makes him? He wants to bomb kids, he is so much more evil than the last action movie villain I saw who only wanted to kill the hero. Anyway, the heroes can't stand by and let the poor little tykes get blasted into thousands of tiny pieces so they get in their Humvee and race to the compound and kill the seventy guards there, take out the drug lord, save all the kids and then outrun a huge explosion, all in under five minutes. It does make one wonder why they bothered with the air strike in the first place.After saving the kids they take them to the extraction point but the team and the kids can't all fit onto the chopper so the kids go first and the heroes stay behind, only to see it shot down on the orders of the mysterious Max. See he really is evil, not only does he want to kill kids, he actually kills kids, there is a flaming teddy bear amongst the wreckage that proves it! The Losers realize that they were supposed to be on that chopper and fake their own deaths and go underground until they are ready to get revenge on the evil Max.The rest of the movie has your requisite number of shootouts, car chases, explosions, fight scenes and all the other things an action movie is supposed to have. I didn't find any of the characters to be especially interesting or likable, quite the opposite in fact. On several occasions I really wanted Jensen (Chris Evans) to get die a horrible death. It's a bad sign when you start to root against the heroes. Not that the villain was any better. The movie spent a lot of time establishing just how evil Max (Jason Patric) is; blowing up kids, shooting random people for no real reason, planning to make money off starting a war, shooting more random people, etc. The only thing he didn't do was toss kittens into a meat grinder while wringing his hands and laughing maniacally, isn't it enough he betrayed and tried to kill the heroes?

93,montera_iulian,The Losers takes on entertaining action movies this year so far.,7,4 May 2010,"This is one of those movies you shouldn't not take it serious: if you do, you'll fail. The Losers is such an entertaining way of delivering an action movie. It has nice captioned fights, explosives, rocket launchers and all the ingredients you need to enjoy a damn nice movie. It has a bad-ass chick who is played by Zoe Saldana, it has some nice jokes to fill the blanks here and there and while you might think the movie is kind of dull, it has it's personal little twists. It is not slow-paced, everything is happening very fast so you can feel the energy from this movie and with all it's flaws and little clichés it's still one of the most entertaining action movies this year so far.There was no over-acting which was very good. The acting was exactly what I wanted for this kind of movie, the characters having that ""I don't give a F**K!"" attitude while they still try to be as protective and careful they could be. I liked the editing of this movie, especially the video editing which is real nice because it delivers so well the point of this movie which is to... ENTERTAIN!... Cinematography helps along and offers us some good captioned fights scenes but I wish I had more of Zoe's ""sexy"" moments... I mean she delivers a sexist feeling for like 2-3 minutes in the whole movie which was not that much. The music in this movie raise up the spirit of the movie and adds some good oldies and new tracks mixed together in a pleasant bullshi* way.At the end of the day I strongly recommend this movie to get yourself and your friends entertained, It's not a mind-blowing story and it doesn't have outstanding acting performances but it has simply what most of these movies this year didn't have which is some ""great delivery for entertainment"".PS: YEAH! I forgot what ruined the movie for me :(. The plange which exploded i mean SUCH BAD VISUAL EFFECTS :(... but you'll see...",The Losers
94,ChristianUnchained,The most ho-hum action comedy of the all,4,6 July 2013,"The Losers is so run of the mill it hurts. Despite a talented cast (Chris Evans, Idris Elba) the movie never really takes off except for a couple of laughs and cool action sequences here and there. The script is pretty horrible, the action is uninspired and the plot is ridiculously predictable. There are one or two neat scenes of action that are creative as they are cool, but are either too short or too silly to be practical.The whole film feels like a Hollywood action comedy blockbuster checklist, following the formula and never truly deriving from it to create something unique or entertaining.",The Losers
95,Legendary_Badass,The Title Says It All,5,23 April 2010,"It's surprising how there actually can be truth in advertising. For The Losers, the title says it all.The title is derived from slang used to identify an eclectic black ops team serving the interest of our proud nation. Notable members include Jensen (Chris Evans) who runs communications. Rogue (Idris Elba), whose skill is to get angry and cause fights among teammates. There is also a sniper named Cougar (Óscar Jaenada) and a driver named Pooch (Columbus Short) who is inexplicably infatuated with a Chihuahua bobblehead. They are lead by the more levelheaded Clay (Jeffry Dean Morgan).On a mission in Bolivia the team is sent to paint a target with a laser for an aerial strike, but they call it off at the last minute when they find some children being trucked in to serve as human shields. This doesn't sit well with Max (Jason Patric), a high level CIA agent who setup the mission in an effort to keep his affairs secret. Naturally, Max wants them dead. So our team of heroes fakes their deaths, get down to business, and plan to take down Max with the help of the mysterious Aisha (Zoe Saldana).I'm not familiar with the source material, which from my understanding is a comic book. The way titles are handled recalls the medium. It's a blunt way to introduce characters, but it's effective enough that I never had trouble recalling who is who. This style translates to addressing location changes, of which there are many.Typical action movie logic is in play and it stirs up unnecessary confusion. The Losers seem to perpetually be looking for something. Every time they steal a key item to get to Max, they have to get something else. It would have been simpler for them to just cut to the chase and go after the WMDs that Max is after: the ""snukes"". If you've seen the South Park episode that parodies 24, you'll get a chuckle every time ""snuke"" enters the conversation. Even if this isn't a misguided joke, it's not a threatening name for a device that forces an island to consume itself in a zero pollutant fashion.I find Chris Evans funny, and given what he has to work with he puts in a solid effort. There isn't a lot to comment about concerning the performances of other Losers. Perhaps that's because they are in the shadow of Jason Patric's Max, the worst villain of our young decade. Max is the kind of guy who spends a lot of time laughing at his own terrible wisecracks, which from the perspective of the audience only derail the film. I'm uncertain if Max knows these lines are this dreadful, even though here are reaction shots of bystanders not enjoying them. Maybe this would have worked with another actor, but we'll never know.Another big problem I was having involved the non-diegetic music. Director Sylvain White turns up the stereo with the most random of song choices. The action sequences themselves aren't bad, but we don't need Journey to chime in and inform us of their comic nature. Adding fuel to the fire is look-what-can-I-do editing that actively scrubs time (the 300 effect) and misappropriation of slow motion.With The Losers, you get the required levels of action you'd expect, but for a film that doesn't take itself seriously, it isn't funny. I liked the comradery of our protagonists, but subplots about 8-year-old girls soccer games and a roast ham for a nemesis completely negate it. The Losers also sets itself up for a sequel, and not in a way anyone would want it. In an age where media lies to the masses, it's nice to have an appropriately titled movie in release.",The Losers
96,blackmambamark,A forgetful action flick....,6,25 April 2010,"Remember the quote from that Seth Rogen delivered in ""Knocked Up""? When he said ""Things always come better in two's. Volcano, Dante's Peak.....Armageddon, Deep Impact."" It is a very true statement. Where there is one good idea, another copy always seems to follow. Case in point with this movie. Kind of ironic that its release is only a month or two before the big budget ""A-Team"".Okay, this question is for the guys......do you remember when you were a kid, and you saw an awesome action movie, and you thought is was cool as hell, but when you got older and watched it again, it was pretty stupid. Well, thats what this movie is. Its a dumb ""B"" movie action flick. First, lets start with the boring story. It starts out pretty decent, somewhat relative to ""The Running Man"", but as it moves forward, you slowly begin to loose interest in its dull plot, mainly because of these crucial mistakes.First, the main villain named Max. You could tell that the writers were trying their hardest to make this guy funny/sarcastic along with being evil. But not only did it come off as stupid, but annoying as well, seeing that they casted some horrible no name who couldn't act his way out of a wet paper bag. Second, the movie tried to incorporate twist and turns in its un-elaborate plot. Once again, it came off as boring and stupid, and really didn't have me saying ""OH NO!"".....nor did i really care enough about the main characters to really feel the twist they were trying to sell me. Third, this movie made the same mistake that ""Quantum of Solace"" made, and that is never fully explaining what your main villains ultimate plan is. I mean sure, they showed you what he was capable of, but they never really bothered to go into detail......probably because the editor of this movie was just as annoyed at looking at the main villain as i was.Bottom Line, this is a very forgetful action movie. Nothing really stood out for me. In a couple of weeks, it will be swept under the rug. I understand that this is a ""Take it for what it is"" action movie........okay, well i took it, and now im sending it back because it left a foul taste in my mouth. Don't get me wrong, i love fast paced action movies that really don't have to explain a lot.....but this was just boring. Now lets hurry up and release ""A-Team"" so we can forget about this one all together.",The Losers

99,changmoh,It's Pulp Action Flick,5,22 April 2010,"The title of this movie may actually be fair warning and disclaimer. And if you are still game to catch ""The Losers"", then I guess you won't be bothered much about its ridiculous script that so often crosses the border to stupidity, or the inane lines.And if what counts for you is the action - accompanied by the Coke and popcorn, then you will find ""The Losers"" an unpretentious, testosterone-charged flick that you would wanna see with the boys - when there ain't no game on the TV.There's this bunch of five US Special Forces guys with silly nicknames like Clay, Jensen, Rogue Pooch and Cougar (Jeffrey Dean Morgan, Chris Evans, Idris Elba, Columbus Short, and Oscar Jaenada respectively) who are betrayed by a baddie called Max (Jason Patric) and left for dead after botched mission in Bolivia.Left stranded in that godforsaken country, the five get high-paying jobs as consultants to the Bolivian military! Scratch that. Of course, I am joking. The guys need to take REVENGE and helping them do that is Aisha (Zoe Saldana), a mysterious hot babe with her own agenda.Director Sylvain White thinks he knows what every hot-blooded action fan wants and he gives them incredible (and incredulous) fighting action every 10 minutes or so. When Clay meets Aisha at the pub and takes her back to his digs, they strip down and beat the heck out of each other - as foreplay!Of course, as in every action flick, there's the bent-on-world-destruction plot - and here it is about someone building a 'green bomb' that causes maximum destruction with minimum damage to the planet! (Go figure that out, guys). As expected, the lines are real lame, the acting is below par but Saldana puts on quite an array of eye-candy. Thankfully, White spares us the gory and bloody scenes - especially of maimed children - and does not take himself seriously.

100,slayerjmk95,This is Definitely Not a Loser,8,6 April 2012,"The Losers is a film about a group of specially trained soldiers known as ""The Losers,"" who basically deal with some of the toughest assignments the government has to offer, but when the group is framed and left for dead, they have to fight to get their lives back and stop an evil mastermind from creating a new world war.Directed by Sylvain White, this action-packed movie is full of funny one-liners, intense gun-fights and good acting for a straight-up action movie. From a script co-penned by Peter Berg, you know from the get-go that it'll be a fun ride (he previously did Hancock and The Kingdom). Jeffery Dean Morgan was fantastic as the typical action hero in the role of Clay, the leader of The Losers. Idris Elba was great as Roque, the closest friend Clay has ever had, and he acts his role with commitment and style. Chris Evans was hilarious as Jensen, the communications operator and field operative who makes noise when they need it; he creates all the great laughs. Columbus Short and Oscar Jaenada were great in their roles as well; Pooch, the driver, and Cougar, the long-range assassin who is better with a sniper than a conversation. And then there's Zoe Saldana as the absolutely beautiful eye-candy Aisha, the ex-CIA operative who is helping The Losers take down Max (played by Jason Patric), the evil mastermind; she has great, sexy take-down moments during the action sequences. The visuals were good, nothing spectacular except for one scene half-way through the film (if you've seen it, you know). The inclusion of some classic songs and tunes helped keep a fun, action-filled atmosphere when nothing serious was happening.All-in-all, The Losers is a fun thrill ride that has plenty of action and comedy to keep moviegoers interested and wanting more. My only concern is they make a sequel; the ending sets that up perfectly.8/10 Stars***",The Losers

I think if this was released now in world where comic book movies reign it would take a lot more money than it did. It wouldn't of course cost 25 million to make as that wouldn't cover the pay cheques for the talent involved. What let's this movie down is the antagonist. No offence to Jason Patric he's an established actor but his attempt at menacing CIA character failed miserably and I found him very annoying. Overall this is a great action movie and it's a shame the director hasn't gone on to direct other comic book movies as what he did with this movie on such a small budget is impressive.

105,Nighthawk1,The equivalent to cinematic junk food,6,29 July 2010,"The Losers as a movie and a graphic novel adaptation lies somewhere between mediocre and half-decent; closer to the former than the latter. There are lots of explosions, plenty of action and a fast pace throughout. The action is on the level of pg-13 which diminishes it. It's also quite silly, inane and dopey. Even though the dialog is pretty bad at times, admittedly I found some of the one liners funny. The pacing is very kinetic and energetic which is sometimes to its benefit but also to its detriment. The plot is befuddling not because of complexity (or lack of) but because of its utter ridiculousness and the speed at which the movie progresses. The movie rarely lets up which often leads to confusion. I forgot about following the plot after awhile and decided to just go with the movie and try to get something out of it.There are far better action movies and graphic novel adaption that have been produced. Those movies are worth seeing before this one. The movie isn't boring. It's just empty and barren. There is no trace of substance whatsoever. Watching The Losers is the equivalent of eating too much junk food and getting a sugar rush. Agreeable, while a person consumes it but instantly forgettable right after possibly leading to a bad feeling of some sort afterward such as a headache.",The Losers

From here on out it's true Michael Bay dedicated destruction with a sprinkle of wit, mainly thanks to Chris Evans (shame he couldn't have done the same for Fantastic 4) and Pooch's delivery of the line: 'Oh, this is Stupid Question Day' – you had to be there.It has a few shockers, despite being built on predictable foundations, which won't make you likely to stop rustling through the popcorn but gives the film a fluent flow as to not make the whole experience completely monotonous. Meaning the only losers here are the ones who turn a deaf ear to the humour and a blind eye to the action because they weren't expecting an experience that is almost as mentally relaxing as Paracetamol.To put it simply The Losers is fun.

The plot is strange and difficult to make out. Something to do with the bad guy being able to destroy islands and plans to also kill a team called The Losers because they know too much. It maybe silly but it suits the films fun tone.People go to these types of films expecting action and comedy and thankfully, you get both. The comedy comes in the form of Chris Evans who steals the film whenever he is on screen. The action is also good in an enjoyable way rather than in a serious way. The CGI may not be perfect but it serves its purpose. While The Losers may make for an interesting team, the villain falls somewhat short.

It's loud, explosive and lots of fun. It isn't, however, a great film, nor is it as good as other action packed testosterone fuelled shoot 'em ups such as Die Hard or Con Air. It is a solid flick in terms of some of the dialogue (the screenplay was written by the credible Peter Berg) i.e not too cheesy and the acting wasn't too wooden either. In fact, Chris Evans' character provided some much needed light relief in the film and most of the sparring between the crew of Losers works well. The only weak link for me was Jeffrey Dean Morgan who, although good in Watchmen, seemed to ooze cheese from his very paws in this one. To be fair though, I'm not sure he was meant to take the role quite as seriously as some of the other leading men in these types of films do, but who knows, you can make your own mind up on that score.So, in the end, The Losers turned out to be a good, pretty much brainless stand off between some not quite so good guys and some very very bad guys.

Not a very original plot, but maybe good for 90 minutes mindless entertainment. Also it's got Chris Evans and Idris Alba among the cast, so it might not be all bad. Well, if I was 12 years old again and a fan of the comic book, I might have liked it. Sadly i'm not and what i saw was a plot full of holes, a villain so ridiculous that it defies belief and on top of that I got bad acting, stupid dialogue and a romance angle that made no sense at all. The plot had a few twists that merely made me go ""yea, whatever"", like the girl who turns out to be the daughter of a drug lord that was killed in the beginning. Later she tells them that her father knew all about the villains plan and tried to stop him. Yea right, a drug lord in the middle of a jungle knowing all about a CIA boss' plan to start a war. A likely story indeed. We do get quite a few explosions, which may answer the question as to why some people gave this good reviews.

Go into the theater knowing that you put $10 down to watch a lot of cool shoot-out sequences, big explosions, some slow-motion love making and fast-paced dialogue and I promise you will leave happy.""The Losers"" begins in a Bolivian jungle where a special ops team of five soldiers needs to ""paint a target"" on a drug lord's villa. (To paint a target means to place a laser target on an object such as a drug lord's villa so the missiles on an overhead fighter jet can destroy the target with pinpoint accuracy. I feel that I need to explain that because it is not explained fully in the movie. If it wasn't for ""Clear and Present Danger,"" I wouldn't have known what was going on either. Thank you, Tom Clancy.) While the team is painting the target, they see 25 children inside the villa, the team decides to do the heroic thing and rescue the children. This is a great action sequence, with a lot of video game-like violence. The director, Sylvain White, must own an Xbox and a copy of ""Call of Duty Modern Warfare"" because that was exactly what it felt like in the first 10 minutes of the film. The children are rescued and all is well until the evil super villain, Max (played by Jason Patric, but not seen at this time), takes revenge on the team for not following orders therefore eliminating the children. I know it is extreme, but if it didn't happen there would be no movie.The Losers are now stranded in Bolivia and the team leader Clay (played by Jeffrey Dean Morgan) wants revenge on Max. Through a well-choreographed hotel room fight between Clay and Aisha (played by Zoe Saldana), we find the team going back to America to find Max and get their revenge. (Now that I think about it, this is the second movie where Morgan has a violent fight with a woman, the first being in ""Watchmen."" I wonder what that says about the types of roles Morgan chooses.) We are soon introduced to Max. Max is a super dry super villain. Without his dryness, he is another villain ""off the factory"" line. Patric brings a new personality to the Max character, he is somewhat mysterious and very evil but in a way he is likable. He does fall into some of the evil villain stereotypes, which we have seen before. He even has an evil henchman. Max still has the same wants and desires as any other super villain – to take over the world or start a war between countries or to steal a lot of money. Have the Hollywood writers really exhausted all the possibilities of what motivates an evil super genius? I hope not. As far as ""The Losers"" is concerned the answer is ""yes,"" they have exhausted the Max character's motives but they make up for it in his persona.The Losers begin their strategy to abduct Max, but through an intense action sequence in downtown Miami where they mistakenly take a very valuable object of Max's. Max needs this item to fulfill his plans of evil doing. All along there is some alpha dog tension between The Losers and a lot of attraction between Clay and Aisha. This story line has been done before but that's OK.All this action finally climaxes when the story brings everyone to a Los Angeles shipyard. There is some clever double crossing that adds a ""how did that just happen?"" moment and the film ends with a nice set up for a sequel. Does it need one? I guess the box office sales will determine that.After everything is said and done, ""The Losers"" is a movie, no more, no less.

118,DrLex,Doesn't know what it wants to be,5,28 July 2010,"Take key scenes from successful action movies from the past few decades. Glue them together without bothering much about coherence, and also don't bother writing decent dialogue. That might well be the way in which 'The Losers' was created.The problem is that it took way too long before I realized that this film does not want to take itself as seriously as it seemed from the start, but instead wants to be over-the-top. Until about 25 minutes, it seems like an action thriller with some comic elements. Then the first really-over-the-top thing happens, unexpectedly. My reaction was 'huh?' It was as if someone changed the channel.Even if I would be able to erase my memory and watch it again knowing beforehand that it is supposed to be a pile-up of clichés glued together with bad dialogue, I still would be only mildly entertained.Maybe this film was supposed to mock the state of current Hollywood productions. Maybe every scene was intended to be predictable, all the dialogue to be bad, all the action to be over-the-top like in the 'Crank' movies. Maybe shaky cam was intentionally used at totally inappropriate moments, and the colours over-saturated to the level of an LSD trip. The problem is that the director apparently was too afraid to make the dialogue truly obviously bad, wanted most of the action scenes to retain a hint of realism, and tried to make the story not too silly at some times. The result is that the whole thing falls in between a good realistic movie and a movie that is so over-the-top that it becomes good. It is just mediocre.If you want constant over-the-top silliness like in 'Crank', you'll be bored during long parts of this film. If you want to watch a decent realistic action movie, those few over-the-top parts will break the entire experience. 'The Losers' just doesn't know what it wants to be.I give it a 5, for ""didn't make me feel I totally wasted my time, but I would not want to watch it again unless there's really nothing else to do"".",The Losers

My own fault as i totally admit i got the movie based on two facts, being that it starred Zoe Saldana who is really cute, and Idris Elba a talented British actor.And that's where the good points end.The film is so full of holes in the plot you could strain cabbage and actually straining cabbage would be preferable. Because it is a cartoon based film there are huge leaps of faith, such as you just have to accept that five guys were smuggled from Bolivia to the USA in coffins, no questions. And so it goes on. Jason Patric is terrible and i mean really terrible as Max, the arch villain. A worse piece of acting I have yet to see in a very long time.It's Kitch, camp, juvenile and a waste of time, money and celluloid.Its full of action and guns and explosions which if your 12 years old or stimulated by such banality will have you drooling.

Because I went Friday then found out my friend wanted to go Sunday, and it was good enough to warrant two viewings.The Losers is no masterpiece, it won't win any awards, but it's a hell of an enjoyable movie with a high rewatchability factor. It's stylish, witty, and never takes itself too seriously.Never heard of Jeffrey Dean Morgan prior to this, but he's effective as the group's leader. He exudes authority, and he's someone you'd feel confident following into battle. Jason Patric does the whole super villain thing, and it works. At one point he nods to his right hand man who then proceeds to throw a scientist they're intimidating off the roof. Patric is annoyed: ""That was at most a hit him in the face nod. I think I speak for everyone here when I say your actions were excessive."" He also wears a glove on one hand to cover up what appears to be a burn scar, because super villains always have to have some odd thing about them. Chris Evans is the other highlight. He's great at comic relief, and has a number of laugh out loud moments. His rendition of ""Don't Stop Believing"" was probably the best part of the movie. Zoe Saldana (Star Trek, Avatar) is another asset to the cast.Camaraderie is an element I always appreciate seeing in films, whether it be the criminals in Johnnie To's The Mission or the soldiers in Black Hawk Down. The group here is like a mix of the two, soldiers turned mercenary outlaws. But they stick together, and in spite of the occasional argument you respect the relationship they have with one another; you believe any one of them would take a bullet for another.Relative newcomer Sylvain White competently directs The Losers as a smart and stylish over the top shoot 'em up. It's witty, it's slick, and it's fun; I just wish there were more movies like this.",The Losers
121,MisterMxyzptlk,Winners and Losers,5,31 August 2010,"Based on the popular comic book and visually ripped from the likes of Peter Berg. Who interestingly didn't direct the film, but helped pen it. However, it feels like a Berg film throughout. Which is the good and bad. Visually, Berg is perhaps one of my favorites. But if you also recall Berg films, he has done some stinkers (Hancock) ad mist the gems (Friday Night Lights). Here the film starts off reminiscent of the old TV show the A-Team. A group of soldiers are framed for a crime they didn't commit and must prove their innocence. Once the groundwork is created, we shift to auto pilot. The team is congested with colorful, almost psychologically damaged individuals. Check. Add a sultry ass-kicking female to throw a kink in the armor. Check. Waggish banter between the crew and loads of Jeffrey Dean Morgan chest hair and we got a testosterone driven action film. It's exciting to see a film that reminded me of the old classic, morally bankrupt action films of the 80's. I have always wondered if studios were too nervous about allowing their heroes to cuss and shove the large bravado in our faces as they did when I was a child. The Losers doesn't disappoint in this regard. However, the story isn't really that interesting and the sense of tension was muddled. Still, it delivered enough fun to recommend. And Jason Patric does his best impression of an evil mastermind.",The Losers

The characters are like from a comic book. Every character has strong lines that he/she plays, and the occasional humor is what this movie makes entertaining. Long story short, there's a bunch of CIA special ops getting ready to kill some drug lord and make a decision that saves a bunch of innocent lives. Now they are dead for the agency and are laying low, but when the charming girl comes knocking on their door...they get back in the saddle. The bad guy is what all bad guys wanna be like.

However, the makers of this one didn't quite seem to understand any of them. The story is silly - and very predictable once you know it is so dumb, so don't try to think that some scene was smart or you will be disappointed in less than 5 minutes. There are a lot of big factual errors, too.The movie doesn't even have a real conclusion and the main threat doesn't even look as threatening as it should. There are a lot of gaps, the characters are totally flat, CGI is lame, action scenes are not entertaining at all and pseudo-scientific gibberish is truly terrible, especially because it is not really necessary. Why they didn't consult some smart 14-year old about technical details?Far Cry (2008) by Uwe Boll got 3.2 out of 10. The Marine 2 got 5.0. I think these ratings are pretty accurate.

Most of the characters (save for Elba's character) were lifeless and I didn't get the feeling they wanted to save what each of them held dear.I always enjoy Saldana, but her character was too much of smart-ass and should've been shot dead a few times. Morgan's character was calm....all the time. He could probably watch his mom get shot in front of him and only shrug it off.

Operation goes wrong and guys are left for dead. Their CIA boss tried to kill them for some reason.Now, boss of the guys is messed with some really really really bad stuff (terrorism or crap like that) and it is a very very very bad person. So our guys are to stop him and take revenge for the Op that went nuts in Bolivia.After telling you that, yo will see every cliché that has existed in a Hollywood movie applied to this one.

I figured with Jeffrey Dean Morgan and Idris Elba that at least it would have some good characters but it didn't even really have that.

130,thefinisher_23,Well it Doesn't,7,27 April 2010,"Does it make sense to take a movie on its own terms? Does it dumb us down as moviegoers to say ""yeah this is as implausible as Cubs World Championship but I'm going to sit here with a dumb smile on my face for two hours"" ? Quite simply, no. Movies are about enjoying yourself. You can be riveted and terrified by a film like ""Shutter Island"" or bewildered by something like ""Kick-Ass"". That me brings to ""The Losers"". It's by no means a masterpiece but it is (for me) rather enjoyable. Why? Well that's what the other four paragraphs are for.""The Losers"" follows the idea of the A-team but are hardly the same story or the same men. They're a military special ops unit sent in to off a South American drug-dealer turned terrorist or something of the sort. Anyway they happen upon his base and see a bus of children being used as mules. The group acts. They radio the pilot of the inbound F-18 to hold off. On their radio pops a voice they've never heard before. His name is Max (Jason Patric) and he knows the kids are there, nor does he care. Now the group is on their own. They predictably rescue the kids before the bomber does his run. They then put the kids on a chopper and stay behind because ""there wasn't room for both"". Stop here. I'm making this a movie-rule. If the would-be heroes of a film have to stay behind we know what's about to happen to those who didn't. Even cute little Bolivian kids aren't immune to here. ""That should have been us"" replies Clay (Jeffrey Dean Morgan). Now our five heroes are on their own, pronounced dead and marooned in South America. ""The Losers"" consists of a silent but deadly sniper Cougar (Oscar Jaenada), hot head Roque (Idris Elba), soon-to-be family man Pooch (Columbus Short), and my personal favorite Jensen (Chris Evans). He's the manliest Geek Squad guy you'd ever meet. While kicking the tires around in Bolivia, Clay is confronted by Aisha (Zoe Saldana). Stop again.The very first scene between Morgan and Saldana is a pretty accurate summary of the entire film. The two beat the hell out of each other in rather stylish fashion. Only, there's no reason for them to fight (yet). They meet, Clay is suspicious but all Aisha says is that she wants to do business. You will know after this scene whether or not this film is for you. If you say ""why the hell are they fighting?"" Then walk away and go see ""Oceans"". Every action scene has a smirk of implausibility to it. Thankfully they're easy to embrace because they're done with a wink and some stout set-pieces. Take the major-shootout in the middle of Miami. Our band of heroes MacGyver's their way out of that one all while none of the bad guys can really shoot straight and the local bystanders just seem to watch. That's not a criticism in any way because it's somehow very cool. It might sound snippy but the truth is that this film's lack of self-importance makes it all the more fun. If the movie doesn't question or explain its own absurdity why should we? None of it would really work if ""The Losers"" were just a bunch of hunky guys with guns. They're own characters, not cardboard cut-outs. Morgan turns in a sly performance as the groups would-be leader. His steamy scenes with Saldana seemed a little tacked on but their just quick cliché. Elba has always been able to play the jerk with poise and disdain and he's the chief one here. While the rest of the crew are in it together he just wants things to stop exploding around him, and for that he blames Clay. Jaenada's Cougar has the least dialogue and it's for the best. If Evans is the funniest one of the group he's definitely it's biggest badass. Evans and Short make the group seem real and charismatic though. Short has a baby on the way and as much you'd think someone like him would have a reason to bail he simply can't. That doesn't seem like a plot-point but an honest character call. Evans provides comic relief without prancing around like a dumbass. In one scene he rocks out to ""Journey"" while attempting to hijack some precious computer files. In a film with wise-ass streak a mile long it's this scene that really put a smile on my face. There's not much to say about the villain Max or Aisha. One is just eye-candy. The other plays your typical villain except he's far funnier and thus less sinister.It's hard to fault a film that knows it's supposed to be fun and not a masterpiece. ""The Losers"" nails that basic premise. While the action scenes aren't particularly groundbreaking or unpredictable they have the quality of looking realistic while not actually being anything of the sort. Many films lose their identity as they go along. Something simple and enjoyable like ""The Losers"" never does.visit me at celluloidlove.wordpress.com",The Losers
131,AHOLDER-1,They still are losers.,5,28 February 2018,"Sound: Mostly pop tunes some orchestral music, nothing really special; with the exception of using Journey's ""Don't Stop Believin'""in an action film. 
60/100 Technical: Heavy use of freeze frame, hand held camera, steady cam, fast paced editing, and skip frame shots. Good use of making a comic book feel in the movie. 
70/100 Character/Acting: Classical use of character conflict. The villian is generically evil. Some of the heroes had very little dramatic arc, they were just along for the ride. 
50/100 Narrative: Uses a prologue to introduce the characters and set the conflict. Open ended finale, I guess for sequel possibilities. Otherwise a straightforward action film. 
60/100 Did I enjoy it: Yes a little, ok to see at a matinee or the cheap theatre. The best part was one of the annoying commercials they show before the previews was put on the reel upside down and backwards, giving a nice dadaistic treat. Take that corporate America. 
50/100 Artistic merit: Not much here just run of the mill entertainment. I do give the backwards and upside down commercial a high score but seperately.

But it also delivers big big dollops of disbelief straight to my back through a suspension running right down on its shocks. Now, I have suspended bigger amounts of disbelief if the ending deserves it, but in this film... it doesn't. Does anyone else think the plot would have been so much better as a sting rather than a traitor? Idris sitting on a big bundle shooting up the villain smells much better than the scene we got. As it was, Skippy the Tech guy died under the panicky guns of the fat security guards. The colonel said, ""for Chrissake, I'm old enough to be your father, get out"".

The movie is total non-sense from start until the end. You can clearly see that all the characters in this movie are acting, no reality on their faces or moves, all so dramatic and so much irritating. A total irrelevant story.

Not really my cup of tea in the first place but the laughs here and there made it watchable. Don't ask me to care about the plot or the characters since they were all comic book to begin with and never really became real enough to care about.

It's fun.I hadn't any significant expectations for this movie, so the enjoyment was even bigger. At times the plot might be a bit predictable but that doesn't disturb the ride at all. It's got fast pace, entertaining action scenes and it's fun. Fun is the word here. The cast was brilliant, as well. Zoe Saldana was great as always. And for the first time i felt that Chris Evans (Push-junk and Fantasticless 4) did a good job. The villain was a bit weak though. But descent acting carried the movie for the whole time.

140,jwchoo1,The Losers : Beat Down Reviews,8,2 November 2010,"Okay people, we have another contender in this series of films. You know tough guy teams type of movie. The Losers can definitely be a contender against The A-Team. Both have the regular story about a team of specialists who get screwed over by the people they are working for. Yes I know its a cliché but come on. Any one who goes to see a movie like this will know what to expect.Guns Blazing and explosions with a hot babe, is there anything more you want.Alright now story wise like I have just explained earlier that its a cliché. Nothing new in that area. But decent acting and pretty good writing is probably what brings this movie together. The leader of this team is 'Clay'(Jeferrey Dean Morgan) he holds this team together and will do whatever it takes to take care of his men. 'Roque'(Idris Elba) is probably the teams second in command. He loves knives as you will see in the movie and has a bit of a weird side to him. Then comes 'Pooch'(Columbus Short), he is the teams driver. He also has a kid on the way and has doubts on whether or not to carry on this revenge mission. 'Jake'(Chris Evans) is the teams coms expert and a womanizer. And finally there's 'Cougar'(Oscar Jaenada) the teams sniper and recon scout.Along the way they encounter the hottie of the movie 'Aisha'(Zoe Saldana). Who turns is more than what she say she is. Then of course the main villain 'Max'Jason Patric) is the one who wanted the team dead.Okay so overall the movie is your average summer action movie. This movie has a few surprising twists here and there and that is what makes me believe that this movie is slightly better than The A-Team. Because no matter how much fun The A-Team was, it was still too unrealistic.Although one complaint I have about this movie was that actor Oscar Jaenada was pretty underused. I think he only had half a page worth of line for the whole movie. Although the funny bit in the movie really helped me forget about that.So I give The Losers an 8/10 as this film hits a bit more spots as a summer action film",The Losers

This group includes five people. Each of them has a particular skill. Some problems occurred to them in the story and the group becomes a real loser. They struggle to suffer their disgrace.The most interesting point of this movie is that it is full of power which makes the viewers thrilled and excited very much. It contains a lot of scenes of fighting. Even female, they fight fiercely with weapons such as guns. In addition, how the story develops is interesting, too. There are some big parts viewers cannot have ever expected.What the story of this movie wants to tell is, in my opinion, that there does not exist any perfect justice. There might be betrayals around you. You should not believe in people around you too much even though they are close to you. I am so much as feel scary after watching this movie.In conclusion, this is a story of a mission group which includes five people with special skills individually.

Zoe Saldana did an excellent job in her fighting scenes (no extras; she put in work). Columbus Short is already athletic so I expected him to bring the action. I knew Idris Elba for dramatic films but it wasn't until ""Luther"" that I started seeing him in action flicks, and after that I realized he is a very strong and athletic character, too. The reason I keep talking about action is because so much of this film is full of energetic combative scenes. But my favorite part of the film is none of that.

The betrayal of a team member the hero had a fight with, the team being rescued by the female co-star, the villain shooting the tech guy as soon as he armed the bomb. There isn't a shred of originality to be found ANYWHERE in this film. The evil villain is ridiculously cartoonish. I suspected he would either walk away at the end or have a quick, easy death, because that's how stupid this film is. And I was right. The villain got away with just a bullet wound in the shoulder.

Flashy slow-motion action scenes, big strong men with a good heart saving innocent people, a nice meaty revenge story ...And yet, it's too clean, too exaggerated to properly work. Even during the calmer scenes, where you should have character development, you find yourself getting flooded with more clichés, more bad one-liners, more macho bravado, more attempts at awing the viewers with how utterly cool the ""heroes"" of the movie are. I can see it working in a comic but maybe they tried to leave too much ""comic"" inside a medium that works differently. The sad part, is that there's a lot of good in this movie too. The ""evil man of the hour"" Max is an interesting character and well portrayed, some of the situations and ideas are properly entertaining but the badly written one-liners and the ""do not give a ..."" attitude of the main ""heroes"" really starts to grate quickly. I mean, how do you add suspense to a movie where the leading characters shrug off or laugh off nearly every death-defying situation. It's just not that interesting to watch. Near the end of the movie, even the interesting parts start to get thin and the characters less well chiseled and without much depth, it just doesn't work.",The Losers

I think a lot of people are star-struck that 'Negan' has a big role, but they must also admit that the guy CANNOT act. Rugged handsome, yes, but a C-rate actor. The only reason this got 2 stars instead of one or even zero is because there was effort made to make a good movie, it just failed MISERABLY. Everything was just preposterous. They toss their dog tags into the wreckage of the crashed helicopter, and that works to convince everyone (investigators included) that their 5 bodies are in the ash. They hijack a helicopter on a freeway that has ZERO traffic in either direction for what amounts to hours. They endure wounds that heal within moments, but they can get face punched a hundred times and not a drop of blood. A helicopter with a big magnet can lift an armored car and carry it away all while being shot at by men with huge machine guns.

It is about a fringe group of soldiers for the United States who end up AWOL, and in some ways may remind you of GI Joe. However, there is no Predator in these jungles, and instead, the action-adventure that ensues is priceless. This is one of my favorite action movies of all time. There are no capes, there aren't a bunch of guys running around in tights, there's no Secret Service budget or 007 dramatics, there's just normal guys with machine guns. The main character is also from Watchmen, the Comedian, and is a solid action actor, and good choice for lead, with supporting actors including Idris Elba and Chris Evans, the selection of actors is fun.

Not being familiar with the original, I found this a not altogether unpleasant diversion, but pretty thin and predictable.I watched it because I liked the basic premise (soldiers burned and looking for revenge) and Jeffrey Dean Morgan and Zoe Saldana. Unfortunately, Morgan was put to much better use in the last comic adaptation he appeared in (Watchmen) and Saldana was much deeper and more likable in Star Trek.The action's not bad in this, but the plot is even less believable than that of the A Team (which is purposely fanciful to some degree). The bad guy is over the top evil, having no qualms about wiping out 25 children, and is getting a quasi sci-fi weapon. The bulk of the movie is taken up by Morgan and his comrades seeking revenge against him and redemption with the help of Saldana.There are a couple of twists that come across as having been telegraphed which don't deepen a shallow plot very much. It's not bad as mindless diversion, but don't expect much more.",The Losers
166,dgefuller,The Z-Team,4,6 October 2010,"Having never read the comic book from which ""The Losers"" is adapted, I went into it with no preconception of what to expect- other than it had an eclectic cast who had previously given some entertaining turns (Chris Evans in ""Fantastic Four"", but also showing an ability to play reserved and affected in ""Sunshine""), some revolutionary turns (Jeffrey Dean Morgan goes from ""Grey's Anatomy"" and ""PS I Love You"" to The Comedian in ""Watchmen"" and it couldn't have been played better) and the brilliant Idris Elba (the BBC's excellent crime drama, ""Luther"")- an actor with incredible screen presence.From the opening scene, it's clear that this isn't about award-winning writing- it's an action movie and that's fine. So let's get some action- it's a little weak, to be honest; a bit like a straight-to-DVD version of the attack on the jungle camp in ""Predator"". The introduction of a villainous presence (later revealed to be, quite unthreateningly, Jason Patric) is rushed, and you can see a mile off what's going to happen to those kids when they get in that helicopter because far too much emphasis is put on Morgan's interest in their welfare, with his big ""look at me, I'm a celebrity helping kids for charity"" type expression. So, after several children are blown up instead of our illustrious titular 'losers', the scene is set: a crack-team of soldiers have been betrayed- forced to become fugitives (hang on a minute- that's the premise of ""The A-Team""- the TV show as well as the abortion that was the film adaptation).What follows afterwards isn't really given time to make sense, who or what Zoe Saldina is actually in this for isn't given enough background or emotional gravitas for us to care (perhaps if they cut out some slow motion they would have freed up about thirty minutes to develop that). Idris Elba looks like he wants to leave for the majority of the film, and the only person having any fun is Chris Evans, who is- as expected- the comic relief, which would be necessary only if Jason Patric wasn't swanning around trying to be menacing and ending up like a slightly dishevelled Jimmy Carr (nice suits though).There's some other villain that the 'heroes' of the piece know, a relationship summed up in one sentence rather than given any room to develop into a grudge match that you would actually like to see played out (even ""The Expendables"" managed that much, whatever its naysayers claim), and a supporting cast of over-actors (is that guy even Indian? why is he pulling every racial stereotype if he is?!).Ultimately, there are moments that are fun- but this film a series of clichés stitched together by a plot so thin the film keeps letting it slip through its fingers in exchange for what it perceives as style- an eight year old with his dad's camcorder, trying to emulate Joe Carnahan.You get 4 stars for Elba being in it, but that's all you're getting. Even for a brainless action flick, this is a disappointment which leaves me still uncertain of Morgan's abilities (as the Comedian he was superb, but as special forces supposedly at the top of his game he doesn't cut it), but hasn't changed my opinions of Evans and Elba- both are still great at what they do. The less said about everyone else involved, the better (particularly the catastrophe that is 'Cougar').",The Losers

They are affiliated with the Provisional IRA who might engage in such activities. In short, the script is idiotic and at times makes no sense. There are some decent special effects that are completely wasted on a movie so poorly thought out and the same goes for the cast who do an amazing job of making this turd of a movie seem vaguely palatable.

So really, even if what went down wasn't meant for the kids (I took it as Max wanting Clay's team AND the kids in the chopper), but for the 'losers', it still happened, and they had to get back at the guy who ordered it- Max. I was also extremely psyched when Zoe Saldana showed up- she kicked butt as usual, and I think she's such a great actress.

Sure, it's not the most original, but few action flicks are these days. But at least from this one you get some pretty great laughs, solid acting with a couple of stand out performances, and an all around fun ride. For me, performances not to be missed include Idris Elba as the intense, skeptical, yet practical second-in-command, pre-Captain America Chris Evans as the utterly obnoxious, yet hilarious motor mouth tech guy (the scene where he goes in under cover as a Journey belting bike messenger is my favorite), and Jason Patric as the possibly insane, unnervingly cheery, bad guy. Columbus Short as Pooch definitely deserves honorable mention. And Zoë Saldana never disappoints.With that said, yes, there are things that don't work for me, like the gratuitous and cliché romance between Jeffrey Dean Morgan and Zoë Saldana. And at times, sure, it is definitely a little too over the top ridiculous, but I think this is by design, and I challenge you to find a contemporary action flick, especially one based on a comic book, that is not.

I just take one of the examples of waste of time scene. when Aisha, the lead female character enter the room with Clay, the ""team leader"" character, suddenly they started fighting,,, for what??? i know maybe she wants to test him or anything, but for what purpose they have to throw a tantrum? and they even burnt the room,,, and,,,, for what????? after that, the scene change to the street where there are not a single marks or bloods of their punches in their faces after their big fights,, what??? And there is one scene that they walked in together in a row in slow motion... that is so cliché... and for what????? and they depend so much on Chris Evans's good looking without having anything value to his character.. come on... I sometimes like to watch B class action movie to just get relax without thinking too much and just enjoy, But even this movie really cant give me that since it is too simplistic.

The dialogue is as if we're sticking to format paper panel strips, than a graphic novel. There are little hints of personality delivered via cutaway, quick close, zoom, or effort of performers. One can clock the act changes; the editing & camera work make for brisk set pieces & tick all the boxes of the genre. We get jargony quips, with squibs & casings littering the otherwise boilerplate exposition. The soundtrack is vapid toothless 'bad guy rock' - had there been a real score the film might've carried some weight in terms of emotion. Disappointing from a guy whose work include Friday Night Lights, The Kingdom, & Hancock, but not outright terrible. I didn't hate it.

201,WeRTonitesEntertainment,The Losers Are Actually Good,6,20 February 2010,"As comic-turned movies usually go, this was one that is unlike any other. From Sylvain White, director of Stomp The Yard, this movie brings an edge to comic-book movies. This is a surprise mix of action, comedy, and just a tad bit of drama. The Losers is a substantial Saturday-night's entertainment.The Losers starts with an attack by a CIA team (Jeffrey Dean Morgan, Chris Evans, Idris Elba, Columbus Short, and Oscar Jaenada), which was a pretty predictable way for the movie to start. The team soon realizes after the compound is demolished, that they had been set up by someone named Max. Since they have no passports, they are bound in the country. Then Clay (Morgan) meets Aisha (Saldana) in a bar, she informs him that she can get them back to the States and help them catch Max. They agree, and the story begins.For the next hour, the silly quips by technical analyst Jensen (Evans) is the only break in between the mediocre action scenes and the dull dialogue. The action and fight scenes are something that this type of audience has seen many times--making those scenes just average. Jeffrey Dean Morgan's portrayal of Clay is good, but a bigger star attached would have gotten a wider audience. Warner Brothers decided to provide a new side of Zoe Saldana--a badass one used for the same purposes as Megan Fox's character in Transformers. The set is nothing spectacular either, I noticed that I've seen the same locations used in up to as many as 3 previous movies. However, The twist halfway through movie renders more thought out of the audience, in the end just confusing them.B-",The Losers

If you are a parent and want to be completely disturbed then this movie is recommended just for that pleasant and over the top scene. If a director feels the need to use ""shock-value"" to this extreme, he obviously doesn't have the creativity to make a good movie which showed in the rest of the film. the movie was crap and so are the makers. I wonder if they run over puppies for fun. -10, F-, f'd up on so many levels I went to bed disturbed and need to watch inglorious basterds to feel human again.

Interesting take on comic book based action flick. It never looses a momentum or pace, it's through and through fun, but if you pay a bit of attention, you will see darker undercurrents and rather deep connotations.

It is a feel good laughing movie with some good action and a bit of everything for everybody.I know Morgan was better in Watchmen but this is completely different film, Evans is excellent in the role and Saldana is just stunning as always.

I watched the first one hour of it and became so bored with it that for the rest of the movie i skipped to the important parts right up to the end.I do not wish to bash a movie but, in my honest opinion (and everyone is entitled to one), this truly is another formulaic predictable cliché Hollywood action flick. I am comparing this action flick to other action movies previously made before like Transporter 1 and 2, Shanghai Noon, Next, Paycheck. These OTHER action movies definitely had substance and quality over ""The Losers"".""The Losers"" cinematography is not pleasing at all. It felt like the movie was just quickly put together to fill a quota of action films produced by Hollywood.""The Losers"" is just more of the same mind-numbing not-funny action movies that Hollywood endlessly and relentlessly produces.I wish that there were more Peter Jackson and Neil Blomkamp and more high-quality movies like District 9 and King Kong.

213,aurora_vampiris,Could have been better,6,29 May 2010,"Perhaps 6 stars is a bit generous, but I'm trying not to be too critical here. I've never read the graphic novel and as such cannot truly say that the movie is constrained by the graphic novel it is based on. But it IS constrained by its graphic novel roots.The prominent problem with the film was, quite unfortunately, the direction and the main villain. Jason Patric's over-the-top, cheesy portrayal of Max - a villain who, in true comic book style, wants to start a global conflict that would end up with the United States of America in charge - was intended to be chilling but merely ends up being atrociously unbelievable. Picture this scene: A woman holding an umbrella up for Max momentarily stumbles because of a sudden gust of wind. So Max blithely pulls out a gun and shoots her in the head, all while holding a comfortable conversation with his chief henchman. Again, it wasn't too convincing - it's the sort of stuff only the best at the hamming-it-up school of acting could pull off... say someone of Stephen Lang's or Mark Strong's calibre. Jason Patric, on the other hand, falls way short.Although, it might not be entirely his fault. The script itself is pretty bad. Picture another scene in the movie - It is a dark, rainy night. The clandestine unit that had, up to this point in the movie, blown up stuff, killed plenty of security guards and soldiers AND hijacked a chopper are now helping one of their agents scale a building. The building turns out to be a hospital. The agent jumps in through the window, removes his hood and comes face to face with his pregnant wife, held in place by two nurses, and she's about to give birth. It's supposed to be funny, but it just comes off as a very poor attempt at a joke. In fact, all of the scenes trying in vain the convey how chilling Max was in person could have been skipped. With little else happening in the movie apart from all-out-action-with-a-LOT-of-exposition, one almost feels that if the identity of Max had been kept a secret, it really wouldn't have mattered in the long run. In fact, the viewer might have even been partially intrigued. As it stands, the film has nothing new to offer.Either way, the movie isn't quite worth watching on the big screen - on the other hand, it might have made for a fun afternoon as a rental pick. The acting, though finds feet in its protagonists. Zoe Saldana hams it up but her talent shines through in the one emotional scene towards the climax of the film - when she faces off against her father's killer. Jeffrey Dean Morgan seems to have actually lost the excellent physique he had from Watchmen (The Comedian), but seems to possess just enough charisma to carry the role. The supporting cast is adequate. However, the true star of the film was, unquestionably, Chris Evans. His comic timing was spot-on, and his physique looks impressive enough to be doing all the free-running he does throughout the movie. In short, all this movie does is to make me look forward to Evans' portrayal of Captain America.",The Losers

Both have meaningless dialogs and are short on plot or character development but The Losers take themselves less serious than The A-Team which makes them a lot more fun too watch.Both movies feature short cuts and shaky cameras making it hard to follow the action and who is shooting who which was bearable in The Losers but really annoying in the A-Team.

But it isn't. It's far better than average. It's full of action, fun, and humour. A perfect blend.Jeffrey Dean Morgan is terrific in his role as the leader of The Losers. He played one of the most memorable characters in last year's Watchmen and it's great to see him in action again.Jason Patric is utterly fantastic as the villain.

219,stan-248,Sterile violence allows the lightheartedness to come through.,6,19 April 2010,"Leave your critical mind at the door as The Losers is a movie from the comic book story that challenges the mind about as much as the strip. The redeeming and damning aspect is the fact that the script simply does not take itself seriously. Before the credits a black ops team in Bolivia is introduced as a warm hearted, convivial group of regular guys who happen to be in the business of killing people for the government. They turn out to be the good guys when they risk their lives (and take many other lives) protecting 23 children who would otherwise be slaughtered in their operation. As it turns out, the off screen CIA boss doesn't like what they did and attempts to kill them and ends up killing the 23 kids but sparing the now rogue team of five whom everyone thinks is dead. Roll intro credits. So now the movie can start.From then on, it is a revenge movie to get that off screen guy, Max, who killed the kids and tried to kill them. Max gratuitously kills a whole bunch more people over the course of the movie just in case you haven't figured out he is the real bad guy. Of course, by extension, the government he works for is also bad. Good timing in these political times.However, there is a problem with this simple action/revenge movie: The snickers and jokes that pepper the script require that the real horror of all those dead kids and people throughout the movie be suppressed. There is virtually no blood, no wailing injured people, just silent dead folks who disappear from the frame. 'No biggie', the movie seems to say 'I don't want to upset you so much about the deaths that you won't enjoy the quips and jokes by these really nice guys"" (and one girl, Zoe Saldana, who adds a plot twist). In fairness to these good guys, the script by Peter Berg and James Vanderbilt tries to minimize the deaths they cause, but the violence is rather overbearing in its sterility. This is just what the audience of young men The Losers targets want, but what message is it sending about the consequences of violence?I won't let on how it ends, other than to say that, like most comic books, the fix is in for the sequel",The Losers

The cast was mostly unknowns except for the actor who played Denny Duquette in Grey's Anatomy (I don't even know his real name), Zoe Saldana (of Avatar fame) and Chris Evans (who played one of the Fantastic Four). Of all the leads, it was Chris Evans who stole the show and provided some comic moments in the film. The villain was very annoying. Whether this was intentional or not, it would have been better if he was less campy. Zoe reminded me too much of her character in Avatar and just reminded me how amazing Neytiri looked. ""Denny"" looked too old and chunky to be doing the action sequences. The movie was also full of clichés. In some scenes, you can almost predict when there will be a car blast, when someone will get shot and when the lead star will save the day.

It doesn't need a serious storyline because the film isn't serious, so don't take it seriously. The performances from all the characters are top notch with Chris Evans' standing out in particular.

Story: 4/10 Dialogues: 0/10 Action: too predictable and cliché, so 2/10 Directing: 3/10 Acting: varies too much through out the movie and from actor to actor to make any kind of conclusion. First of all, dialogs are so poorly written that it is almost unbelievable. Who on Earth would say something like: ""That's right, bitches. I've got a crossbow""... to himself!? Writing of the characters as well. So many of them are left completely undefined and those who are defined in a way are not very convincing due to those terrible lines they had to spill out. As members of the super special team they are supposed to know each other so well and run flawlessly, but they appear as children on a covert mission. Of course, they can not be taken too seriously when who they have against them is a complete idiot. I guess the villain was supposed to turn out as an eccentric character, powerful, unscrupulous, one to be feared... but what we got is a rude jerk with a little too much money and a bad idea. Really? I couldn't recognize Jason Patric in this role. Just terrible. Zoe Saldana did a fairly good job, but had to suffer through a lot of really bad shots and a necessary sex scene with the main guy for this kind of movie. As for the members of the team: - Chris Evans (Jensen) - he managed to create a solid character. Considering the lines he had to work with, he was amazing. - Jeffrey Dean Morgan ( Clay ) - personally I love the guy, just my opinion is that this wasn't the role for him. - Idris Elba ( Roque ) - I have nothing to say about his performance alone, except that it seems that his character was ripped out from another movie and placed there. - Oscar Jaenada ( Cougar ) - nice... probably because he had so little things to say it only improved his character. - Columbus Short ( Pooch ) - writing for this character is so terrible that the guy just couldn't do anything. They just tried to squeeze so much in this that it turned out to be a pile of nothing. First of all, the mood had to be grimmer. I mean, you watched 25 children being killed before your eyes, you're erased and cut off, comrade betrays you, you're wanted dead... All of that is mentioned , true, but real state is not seen. I'm not even going to try and explain the ""boss battle"" at the port because it was so sleazy and full of clichés that is beyond comprehension. In the end, I am not even sure why am I giving it a '2'. Actors, maybe. They did a decent job but it all lacked continuity due to terrible mistakes in writing and directing.

236,lisaselbe,"Entertains Boys, Grown Men & Grandmothers - It's No Loser!",8,28 April 2010,"Yesterday, it was very hot so I took Irene, my 76 year-old mother-in-law to the movies to get her out of the house and out of the heat. We saw only the last hour of The Loosers while we were waiting for our feature film of choice Date Night.The Loosers is like a cross between the A Team and Ocean 11, and although it all seemed deja-vu familiar, it was still hugely entertaining. It is based on yet another comic book, but this one could definitely become a franchise. If you think you recognized Zoe Saldana (Aisha) in the films commercials, you may remember her from last year's Star Trek, or this year's Avatar. Jeffery Dan Morgan (Clay), is this gang's Danny Ocean if you will, and Jason Patric (Max) makes quite a handsome, wickedly twisted, and some how devilishly comedic villain.Although there are some steamy hot love scenes, they are all PG-13. Of which I was very grateful since I was seated next to a Catholic school golden girl. The action sequences will thrill even the most jaded grand theft auto fans, and the quick witted dialog will keep the synapses of PhD's firing like the tongues of rappers amped on Double Shot RockStars! After we saw Date Night my mother-in-law said, ""That was a really great, really fun film."" And I said, ""You can always count on Steve Carell and Tina Fey to deliver."" ""No, I meant the first film."" she said. And you know, she was right. The Losers is a really great, really fun film. If you don't believe me and my Mother-in-law, perhaps you'll trust the judgment of the teen boys with their fathers who we overheard reliving one of their favorite lines from the dialog during one of the action sequences in the parking lot after the film. They each took their turn yelling, ""Doughnut, doughnut, doughnut!"" as they crashed their bodies into the SUV before they got into it and giggled their way home.",The Losers
237,nickhorton2009,Gave up,3,15 May 2010,"Recently tried to watch this film, but struggled for the first half hour with complete boredom and gave up, even my 14year old got fed up and he is an action film freak! The only action scenes had already been shown on various trailers and nothing about the film got me interested. It was a poor attempt at an A Team type story line and I only hope the A team movie is a far improvement from this. I can see from the other reviews that I may be alone in my opinion and I don't want to put people off from going to see this film, maybe i walked out to soon? I might consider renting out on DVD to find out what happens in the rest of the film but only if there is nothing else of interest on the shelf and there is some offer on!",The Losers
238,xtremepcs1,"Great movie, cant believe the bad reviews...",9,29 May 2010,"Great movie, cant believe the bad reviews...I've read a lot of reviews putting this movie down as not violent enough, A-Team rip off etc...Don't believe them!!!! Fun, fast paced, seriously great dialogue...""Im like a black Mcguyver, Blackguyver""...The movie took the time to build the characters and the cast is overall a pretty good group of actors. Jeffrey Dean Morgan was great as The Comedian in The Watchmen (wether you liked the movie or not) and he delivers another standout job here as well. If you liked Idris Elba as Stringer in ""The Wire"" you'll love him here too. He's very good at giving his characters personality that really comes across on the screen. Thought the story was well written, both in the story itself and especially in the dialogue. Clever, intelligent dialogue that often says much more than the line itself. Personally I love a movie with dialogue that really works to convey a certain style...ala Tarantino films. This movie had style in my opinion. Don't let a bad review have you pass this sleeper up!",The Losers
239,d_gd,Don't waste your money.,1,12 June 2010,"The trailer for this film made it look really good, so I went to watch it. So, let me get this straight. A lunatic blows up a helicopter full of children and his comeuppance is to be mugged on a bus. Wow. And the last ten minutes...Now, I'm all for comic-strip adaptations but this must have been written for some kind of Sesame Street mugger type, friendly and fun violence for the family, like the worst ever episode of the A-Team. The cast are so stereotypical they might as well be cardboard, from the tough but caring type to the obligatory token tough gurl to the poor kiddies in peril, its as predictable as water being wet. Personally, I had high hopes for this film but life is full of little disappointments, and this was one of them.",The Losers
240,elibrown1,Offensively bad,2,4 July 2010,"I love action movies. And I love comic adaptations. And I hated this steaming pile of clichéd, hackneyed garbage.From gaping plot holes (Pooch is shot through BOTH legs, but is climbing, running and jumping around a couple scenes later because they were taped up?) to poor type-casting (the funny guy is supposed to be funny - most of Evan's lines were awkward and lame. Even the other characters looked more embarrassed than amused at his quips) to non-existent chemistry (where did that trumped up romance come from? I sure as heck didn't get what foxy Saldana saw in fat, sweaty Morgan), this entire movie felt like a big f^&k you by the producers. 'Sure it was terrible, but we're gonna net a big payday anyway, so suck it viewing audience' was the taste this movie left in my mouth.I'd leave it at that, but Max the Evil Badguy deserves special mention. What a joke. Very possible the worst bad guy ever. Even his string of random unprovoked violence didn't really make him scary. At least, no more scary than a rambling, crazy bum on the street. How is any reasonable person supposed to believe that this cheese-line-spouting psychopath managed to build an evil empire? Nothing about his character suggests he's capable of orchestrating some sort of diabolical master plan.I ask 'what were the producers thinking?', but it's clear they got exactly what they wanted; a cash in on the recent comic book adaptation fad at the viewers expense.So yeah, offensively bad. Thanks Hollywood.",The Losers
241,mithun_sahani,What it sounds Like....Looks Like....it is in real sense The Losers,6,7 July 2010,"Normally I love to read reviews but this movie compelled me to write one. I was so disappointed after seeing this movie that this time I wanted to write to the viewers and warn to make up for the lost time while watching this movie. The movie's title is similar to the feeling inside you, which comes out after you watch the whole movie. Yes it's the LOSER. It's a compilation of all movies I got reminded of Brue Willis's movie Tears of the son during the start, Losers is the pathetic sad copy version of the same. The direction is similar to Bollywood style action. Worst part was watching the acting, directing and story, a villain (Bad guy) who is desperate to sound and look and be bad by pointlessly killing couple of people. The desperate team who is also trying to be looking good by saving couple of people and trying to be ""techi"" by saying some dialogs, and all heard seen cliché of same story borrowed from other films. I do agree there was one or maximum two occasions where it was interesting but rest the wipes out the feeling quickly. The worst part is when I read the papers, with advertising start saying that It better than ""A team"" which made me realize, they just hit the rock bottom which promoting this movie. There is No credibility so lets say its better than the other for giving expectations to the viewers. Compare this to a A Team I feel is just a big injustice done to the word called ""Compare"". I hope people don't watch this movie looking at the rating. I can't give more than 2 star rating, more than that will be injustice",The Losers
242,aramisr77,Great movie !!!!!,10,12 March 2011,"Let me start off by saying that if you slurped down your chai tea then hopped into your prius to see this movie, it probably wasn't for you. This isn't a deep look at the human condition, it's an action flick. This is a great movie with funny good looking characters and quick one liners. Aisha: So what brings you to Bolivia? Clay: Cruise ship. Aisha: We're a landlocked country. Clay: Yeah, well... it's an amazing cruise ship. The Losers is just a lot of fun. I watched it with a few friends, wings and beer. It probably would have done a lot better in theaters but was released the same week as Avatar...",The Losers
243,gamblenot,"3/10, don't waste your time",3,22 May 2011,"Although at best, a renter, that will take you a whole weekend to watch. Easily stopped for hours at a time with no back tracking needed. This movie falls short of anything resembling a decent action movie. If I gave the latest ""Die Hard"" movie a ""10"", this would get a ""1"". To rate it against the best action movies....a -30.Bad acting only compounds the equally deplorable and predictable script."" I can only hope, for the Peter Berg's sake, that more than half of this movie was improvised.What we have here is two ""gonna be's"", Chris Evans, and Zoe Saldana (though not because of, but instead of, this movie), one ""Brad Garrett"" wannabe (Morgan), a has been ""Patric"" (soon to be playing roles that an aging Eric Roberts can no longer play), and a bunch of never will be's, trying desperately to salvage some kind of order in a mind numbingly boring tale of revenge.Truth be told, the only saving grace in this movie is the Soundtrack, featuring, a couple of times, ""Don't Stop Believing"", by Journey.SPOILER Chris Evans' character does give me the only chuckle in the movie using this song. Not much of a spoiler, I admit, but, one, none the less.",The Losers

245,serenity-739-142787,Loved it!,10,25 April 2014,"Loved it!! Having never seen the A-Team (as everyone is comparing it to and I'm old enough to have watched it as a teen had I chosen to) I really liked it. I thought these characters were very well acted and likable - especially Cougar and I'm a fan of Jeffery Dean Morgan. The script was well thought out and flowed smoothly with a great mix of action and humour with a few unexpected twists thrown in. Thoroughly enjoyed it from start to finish. I could easily watch a series based on these characters played by the same actors in this film. It reminded me somewhat of ""The Young Guns"" with the young Keifer Sutherland, Charlie Sheen, Emilio Estevez and I think Lou Diamond Phillips except in a completely different scenario. The camaraderie, action and humour was all there.",The Losers
246,seegoon,Who is the real Loser in this relationship?,2,13 November 2011,"The Losers is a remarkable and brave piece of surrealist cinema. It scurrilously dispenses with the hegemony of cause and effect. It fearlessly deconstructs our prescriptive notions of human behaviour, introducing a new psychology; a tissue of chaos theory and neo-objectivism. It lays bare our expectations of art and civilisation, painting them each as stale and worthless.No, wait. It doesn't. It doesn't do any of those things. It falters, flops and fails. Nobody in the creative department in this film appears to be interested in trying to appease the audience's selfish needs for logic or even pleasure. Not a solitary event in the film is prefaced by the burden of reason. Things just happen. Deus ex machinae reign. Every character is a poor simulacrum of an archetype of a cliché. In fact, I strongly suspect that director Sylvain White is a shapeshifting alien, and this is how he reckons people behave. He's never actually met one, but he's read about them in the paper.There isn't a good bit. The fight scenes aren't exciting, the sex scenes aren't sexy and the funny bits aren't funny. The total lack of tension throughout means that at no point are you invested in anything anyone does, and the barrage of slow-motion sequences, jumpcuts, overlaid text and an intrusive, loud and uninventive rock soundtrack mean the filmmaking is conspicuous throughout, destroying any threat of a suspension of disbelief and utterly disinvesting you as a spectator. Simply put it boasts worse pacing than any other film I think I have ever seen, and it certainly gives the impression that an editor went to it with a buzzsaw. I genuinely can't think of anything to commend about this film.I know it sounds like I'm being a snob, but in reality I'm just using a base-level of discernment. Crank is trash but it is gleeful trash. This is trash but it is miserable trash. If it's going to scrape the bottom of the barrel, it has to push a boundary or test a sensibility.",The Losers
247,lizardly,At Face Value,10,5 June 2010,"I saw this movie, never knowing there was graphic novel prior to the movie.That being said, I took the movie at face value without any expectations or presumptions for the characters, plot or otherwise.So at face value I thought this was a a great watch. I found it very entertaining, it had just enough humor mixed into the action and the superhero stunts. The plot was very plausible and I especially liked the ""evil villain"" character.I hope there is a sequel, and will hold off on reading any literature so as to avoid any future presumptions.The critical comments I have read seem only to be from fans of the graphic novel who are hypercritical. Anyone seeing this at face value or without presumptions will greatly enjoy this. Two thumbs up and 5 stars for an well enjoyed evening at the movies. And please get to work on the sequel.

249,ademontis,"fresh, funny, for a good Saturday night",8,30 April 2015,"I enjoyed this movie so much, it is a fresh and 'funny' action comedy where the characters are amazingly portrayed. The plot is not boring, it will seem to lose sense sometimes, and maybe sometimes you will think that some scenes should have been developed better in detail, but it keeps you in front of the screen every minute. There are some outstanding ironic scenes (like the misunderstanding above the roof), some very nice action parts that somewhat recall the A-Team movie. Dean Morgan and Evans are the best actors in the movie, on my opinion, but all the team is very well set. The soundtrack is great, with Don't Stop Beliening (by the Journey) as the main song, in a very nice scene where Evans gives his best. The end scene is worth the whole film.",The Losers
250,cdgrizzly,B Movie at Best,3,10 March 2019,It seemed as if the director had no knowledge of what an action movie should look like and googled up the most cliche actions scenes then chose the worst cuts to use. It felt completely phoned in. Disappointing all around.,The Losers

Thank Coincidence there's a yellow school bus on the drug lord's compound with a few gallons of gas and a live battery! Home-school, or Coincidence? Toughguys need to take out other less-tough-but-still-tough guys who aren't Badguys: no sweat! Use a dart gun that instantly incapacitates any target. Like in freaking paint ball. Darts are better than bullets! (But Toughguys use bullets on Badguys. I suppose because they don't work as well. As darts.) Ballistics, meet Coincidence! Toughguy #1 needs to take out a jet with escaping Toughguy-turned-bad. Thank Coincidence that Badguy #1 negotiated a $20K Ducati in his $1B arms deal. No reason. Except Badguy #2 (#1 never touches the bike)will need it later to chase down the jet. Head-on. And, Thank Coincidence, the laws of physics are suspended so that a bullet shot into the motorcycle from above launches Badguy #2 into the jet intake and, oh, about half a second later, launches the bike on a different trajectory into the fuselage of said jet. I suppose the director never heard of the grassy knoll, notwithstanding his affinity for magic bullets.Almost forgot. Zoe Saldana in a glossy slo-mo, firing a rocket launcher. At something that blows up. Not anything that blows up any minor bad guys. Nope: just an explosion. Bad guys, mesmerized by her glossy, flame-lit hotness, and then the rocket, and then the explosion, all become helpless sacks of meat. Why this enables three handcuffed men on their knees (oops, one was shot through both thighs, so he's on his back) to escape from five guys with guns about to execute them can only be described as... Coincidence. I mean ""stupid."" This show, while not quite atrocious, stretches the bounds of mediocrity.",The Losers
