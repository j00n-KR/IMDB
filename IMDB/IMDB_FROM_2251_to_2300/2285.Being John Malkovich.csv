0,SnoopyStyle,strange and compelling,9,4 May 2015,"Unemployed puppeteer Craig Schwartz (John Cusack) and animal lover Lotte Schwartz (Cameron Diaz) are in a loveless marriage. Craig gets a job on the low ceiling 7½ floor of a Manhattan office building. He falls for alluring fellow worker Maxine Lund (Catherine Keener) who doesn't return the feelings. He finds a doorway in his office that leads into the mind of John Malkovich. After 15 minutes, the person is ejected into a ditch on the New Jersey Turnpike. Maxine decides to sell tickets at $200 a pop. Lotte is completely changed by the experience and thinks she's a transsexual. Craig's boss Dr. Lester is obsessed with Malkovich.This is one of the strangest and most compelling ideas ever put on the screen written by Charlie Kaufman and directed by Spike Jonze. It is exciting that everything and everyone is a little off in this movie. Cameron Diaz is ugly. John Cusack is disheveled. Catherine Keener is a sex goddess. The whole movie is off its axis and so much the better for it. It's so weird that it's a lot of fun.",Being John Malkovich
1,Hitchcoc,What the Heck?,9,8 January 2010,"It is wonderful when a movie comes out that sets new parameters. This is so far fetched, yet so ingratiating, I loved it. There are so many things that struck me that I can't begin to list them all. To start with the crazy living conditions of John Cusack and Cameron Diaz (almost unrecognizable). Cusack is the morose puppeteer who puts all of his angst into his shows, making them most unpalatable. He is frequently struck by people on the street for doing things like Heloise and Abelard in a sexually suggestive manner. Then there's the office complex on the floor between floors which brings every sight gag imaginable. I could go on and will leave the real reviews to others. I just want to recommend this to anyone who wants to see a movie that on the surface sounds ridiculous, but will have you hurting afterward. Malkovich gives his best performance playing a caricature of himself and showing himself to be a great sport.",Being John Malkovich
2,classicsoncall,"""There is truth, and there are lies, and art always tells the truth. Even when it's lying.""",7,17 April 2018,"One has to give credit to John Malkovich for allowing the film makers to use him as a character in this story, and not always to flattering effect. This is one of those quintessential movies to illustrate the absurd by being absurd. It starts out with the kind of quirky humor that I find entertaining enough but then tries to outdo itself by getting more and more in the weeds with it's intricate and often confusing treatment of personality exchanges and multiple Malkovich's. So in other words, it wears the viewer down after a while and gets to be somewhat overbearing in it's quest to be an off-beat movie. Actually, you know you're asking for trouble when Charlie Sheen is called upon to give advice. If you're quick enough, you'll be able to catch momentary glimpses of folks like Brad Pitt, Winona Ryder and Gary Sinise, some of them so quick they don't even qualify as cameos. Not to be too harsh, it's not a terrible movie and if you like off the wall writing and humor, this will definitely fit the bill. And to think it all started with a Help Wanted Ad looking for a man with fast hands.",Being John Malkovich
3,gavin6942,You Were Great in That Jewel Thief Movie,8,7 August 2006,"First, let's just say this was so much better than I expected -- and I already had high hopes. John Cusack? John Malkovich? What more could you want? Now, I would have been hesitant if I had known Cameron Diaz was going to show up, but she was a minor part of the film and handled herself well. One or two more good films and I might finally forgive her for ""Vanilla Sky"".The story is very absurd: a young puppeteer finds a door in his office that goes in side John Malkovich's mind. That's strange enough, but it gets so much wackier from there (but I won't ruin it for you). You have Malkovich in the primary role, who is by far one of the greatest actors in history. And you have Cusack as the secondary role, who is also a great actor - one might even say more versatile (his costume in this film makes him almost unrecognizable as Cusack).What more can I say without giving this away? First, the film is really deep (existential) but also very funny. When Cusack first tells his co-worker about the portal, she asked ""who is John Malkovich?"" which I find hilarious - both because I wondered the same thing when the film first came out, and also because it begins a long string of self-deprecating Malkovich moments.The only other thing you need to know if you're not already sold: this film is a Charlie Kaufman creation. Who's Kaufman? The guy who made ""Adaptation"". And if you haven't seen that, you really ought to (I'd even say it a better film than this classic). There you go: I just suggested a double feature. Get your rump in gear and visit the video store.",Being John Malkovich
4,lee_eisenberg,They did it...they really did it!,10,4 February 2006,"One has to wonder how they came up with the idea for this movie, but that could distract from the movie itself. ""Being John Malkovich"" is so hilarious in every way, that I can't even describe it. You have to see it to believe it. As one of the many movies (along with ""The Blair Witch Project"", ""The Sixth Sense"" and ""American Beauty"") which affirmed that 1999 was to my generation what 1967 was to my parents generation (thanks to ""Bonnie and Clyde"", ""In the Heat of the Night"" and ""The Graduate), this is one movie that you can't afford to miss. It may have very well been the coolest movie of 1999, and it certainly affirmed John Malkovich as one of the great actors of our time.",Being John Malkovich
5,jboothmillard,Being John Malkovich,10,24 June 2005,"There are always people wishing they could be their idols, and this is the ultimate portrayal of when that wish comes true, for whatever purpose, from Oscar nominated director Spike Jonze. Craig Schwartz (John Cusack) is the struggling puppeteer with no job, so after seeing an advert for needed quick fingers, he goes to start work at Lestercorp, on floor 7½ as a filing clerk. As he continues working there, he not only becomes attracted to co-worker Maxine Lund (Oscar and Golden Globe nominated Catherine Keener), but he finds a secret portal into the head of actor John Malkovich (himself) for 15 minutes. After telling Maxine, and pet-loving wife Lotte Schwartz (BAFTA and Golden Globe nominated Cameron Diaz) about the experience, and trying it themselves, they decide to offer the experience to the public for $200 a time. After experiences inside Maljovich where he meets and makes love to Maxine, Lotte is having thoughts about her sexual gender and identity, i.e. she's basically turned gay, and Maxine can respond with her (only through Malkovich). After a while though, Craig has had enough of being a loser and has found a way to control Malkovich and stay inside him. It is with this talent he makes Malkovich the victim for his wanted puppetry career, and he marries Maxine. Also starring Orson Bean as Dr. Lester, Charlie Sheen, Brad Pitt and Sean Penn. The ending does slow a tiny bit with the daughter, but the film is ultimately a fantasy treat. The highlight of the film is Malkovich going through his own portal, and he is in a restaurant surrounded by other Malkovich's. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Writing, Screenplay Written Directly for the Screen for Charlie Kaufman, it won the BAFTA for Best Original Screenplay, and it was nominated for Best Editing, and it was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture - Comedy/Musical and Best Screenplay. Cameron Diaz was number 65, John Malkovich number 59, and John Cusack number 48 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, and Malkovich was number 53, and Diaz number 26 on The 100 Greatest Sex Symbols. Outstanding!",Being John Malkovich
6,ccthemovieman-1,"Two Profane Women, One Dirty Old Man Add Up To Lousy Movie",2,1 December 2006,"This had an interesting premise and an interesting cast. Too bad the movie was so stupid and unappealing with tons of Liberal-secular propaganda, foul- mouthed women and a dirty old man.For the record, the profane females were Cameron Diaz and Catherine Keener. The latter is that way in every movie I've ever seen with her in it. That is one nasty woman. The dirty old man is Orson Bean, who illustrates once again that the older actors weren't exactly much more pure than today's; they just language restrictions.I thought the movie was interesting until Diaz takes a trip into Malkovich's head, then the film gets extremely annoying dialog-wise. Critics liked this movie because (1) it was different and (2) it was irreverent.",Being John Malkovich
7,rmax304823,Craig's Other's Other Wife.,7,20 September 2007,"This is a difficult movie to describe so you have to bear with me. John Cusack plays an unsuccessful puppeteer in New York, married to a thoroughly deglamorized Cameron Diaz. He has the hots for his sole employee, his tough and savvy office-mate, Catherine Keener.Then he discovers a kind of crawlspace in his office, at the end of which is the sensorium of the actor John Malkovich. That is, Cusack can be in the mind of the real John Malkovich, but only for 15 minutes at a time, after which he is spit out and flops on the ground next to the New Jersey Turnpike. Cusack decides that if he can't get anyone to pay to see his puppets he can at least charge the public $200 apiece for their 15 minutes in Malkovich's mind. (This doesn't bother Malkovich because he seems completely unaware of anyone else's being inside him.) But Cusack's secretary, Keener, has the hots for Malkovich and through this ""portal"" is able to get his private phone number and agree to meet her at a restaurant. They meet, as arranged. However, when they sit across the table from one another and Keener gazes at Malkovich, glowing with admiration and a filthier kind of lust, Malkovich's mind happens to be occupied by Cameron Diaz at that moment. Diaz has previously spent time taking a shower with Malkovich and has found the idea of having a male's plumbing appealing. Now, she melts under the adoring gaze of Keener in the restaurant.Diaz returns from Malkovich and tells her husband, John Cusack the failed puppeteer, that she must be a trans-sexual because she has never had a woman stare at her with such love as Keener showed towards Malkovich in the restaurant. Now she wants an operation and she's going to talk to Dr. Lester. The astounded Cusack shouts, ""But Dr. Lester is an ALLERGIST!"" The next evening, Cusack and his wife are having dinner at home with Keener. They explain the situation to her, then they both throw themselves on Keener at the same time. Keener slaps Cusack away and tells Diaz that, yes, she finds Diaz attractive -- but only when Diaz is in Malkovich.Then it gets REALLY complicated. There is a pursuit at one point through the repressed memories of Malkovich's subconscious, with Malkovich seen peeing his pants on the school bus and sniffing panties. (Malkovich -- the real Malkovich -- must have a heck of a sense of humor. His character admits to being stoned, and we see him exercising his libido, being snooty towards cab drivers, and so forth.) The story ends up with Diaz fathering her own child by Keener while occupying Malkovich.If this were a novel, it would be something like Kafka's ""Metamorphosis"" or Nicholson Baker's ""The Fermata,"" both attempt to follow the logic of an absurd premise. It also packs a lot of humor and pathos into the story, along the lines of Pirandello and Ionescu. Example of what I mean: When John Cusack returns from his first trip into Malkovich's brain, he no longer has the piece of wood he took with him. In the face of Keener's skepticism, Cusack demands to know where that piece of wood IS. Did it disappear in the ether? Is it still somehow back there in Malkovich's brain? Good question. Keener, by the way, is very sexy. She has a throaty laugh, nice limbs, and she is strictly utilitarian, only interested in money and sex until she falls for Diaz. She never heard of either John Malkovitch or metaphysics.As a film it most closely resembles something that Woody Allen might have come up with if Allen had been in the habit of ingesting psychedelic substances, or something Monty Python might have dreamed up without any chemical help. (I must say I didn't get much out of ""Brazil."") If you want a sense of the lengths to which this film is willing to go, imagine a scene from ""Swan Lake"" being performed in front of a full audience, involving the entire corps de ballet, with a human-sized wooden puppet in the middle of a circle of ballerinas, and the puppet is unclothed, made of raw wood, with all his hinges and joints showing, and the audience stands up and applauds. In an era when American movies seem to have been formed by cookie cutters, this kind of innovation is startling.Should you watch this? Well, I'll tell you how you can find out. You go to a clinical psychologist, see, and you sit down and take the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory (MMPI), and then you ask the shrink what your profile looks like. If he says ANYTHING like, ""You peaked on Scale Eight,"" you should definitely see this film because you'll appreciate and enjoy it more than most. Otherwise -- well, it's your mind.",Being John Malkovich
8,moonspinner55,Endlessly imaginative...,7,14 April 2002,"I'm surprised so many viewers enjoyed this film--it goes so far out on a limb that it threatens to be potentially alienating to an audience. This is a ticklish joy-ride, full of sheer ridiculousness, yet it all comes together smoothly, managing to be completely free of any cinematic inhibitions. John Cusack plays a puppeteer (with beautiful puppets) who gets an office job in a very odd building (on the 7 1/2 floor!), where the term 'low overhead' is literal. The movie does get convoluted in its final stretch, but it never fails to be engaging and wildly clever. The acting by Cusack, Cameron Diaz, Catherine Keener and John Malkovich is superb. Fanciful, original and amusing ideas come from left and right. Credit writer Charles Kaufman with a screenplay that is never pretentious or cynical, and director Spike Jones for never losing sight of his characters, all mad romantics. *** from ****",Being John Malkovich
9,blanche-2,strange and fascinating,7,1 June 2000,"I had no idea what this film was about when I rented it.  After seeing it, I'm still not sure.  It is definitely the strangest film I have ever seen, possibly the most original as well.  The first hour or so was absolutely hilarious.  Then the film, for me, became darker and stranger.  The performances were all marvelous and interesting.  The concept is thought-provoking - not an easy film to stop thinking about.",Being John Malkovich
10,Quinoa1984,The Best Film I Have Seen in a Decade.,10,13 January 2000,"""Being John Malkovich"" has it all.  Comedy, drama, romance, and a whole lot more.  But more importantly it is original.  And when I mean original I mean this film is the most original piece of work I've seen in decades.  Nothing like this has ever been made, and seeing how it's original, nothing like it will ever be made again.  And this is for three reasons:1: The acting, which is some of the best of the year and then some.  John Cusack in a warped role as the odd puppeteer, Cameron Diaz as his pet store working wife, Katherine Keener as the devilish office worker, and as himself in his best role ever, John Malkovich as the only person he could perfectly play- himself.2: The script, which is the most original funny and odd one in years to come around.  Who could've ever thought of a normal person going into the brain of an famous (Oscar nominated) actor- and coming out on the side of the New Jersey Turnpike?!  And when Malkovich goes inside the portal into his own brain, he finds a whole restaurant full of himselfs.  I think that is weirder than anything you could see in you're entire life (when not on drugs)     and 3: The Director, Spike Jonze.  This is Spike Jonze's first adventure into feature films (he was and still is and actor and music video director) and it is probably what he will be most remembered for.  Unlike some other directors, Spike doesn't take a scene and go on to another, he actually expands on his ideas and works with them to their maximum potential.  
Along with a funny script, a surprise at every turn, and a hilarious cameo with Charlie Sheen, this film is definitely in my top ten of the year and the decade.  Magnefike.  A++",Being John Malkovich

Behind a file cabinet he discovers a secret passage that is a portal to the brain of movie star John Malkovich. Cusack confides in a  bawdy co-worker (Catherine Keener), who he has a crush on. They both decide to go into a small business of selling trips into the head of Malkovich.The humor is witty and dark. The story line is so obtuse it is near hypnotic. The viewer is compelled to watch again a little bit closer.Cusack is wonderful and proving to be a very versatile actor. Cameron Diaz plays Cusack's wife, who contemplates a sex change and falls in love with Keener.

12,sunwarrior13,Getting Inside Malkovich's Head,10,11 November 2016,"John Cusack stars in a film that follows a puppeteer in a film directed by Spike Jonze entitled Being John Malkovich.

Craig Schwartz works as a puppeteer and is having tons of financial problems.He get a temp job as a file clerk on the seventh-an-a-half floor of a large office building.But one day,he surprises himself that he finds a small door that leads him towards the head of guess who - John Malkovich himself - while rummaging behind a cabinet.Then he and his beautiful co-worker Maxine tries to make money out of it by charging admission for the spending 15 minutes inside the head of well-known actor.Things become uncomfortable for John Malkovich himself as a lot strange things start to happen to him as different people spend time inside his head and cannot do anything to stop it. Then Craig's wife,Lotte takes a trip inside Malkovich himself and things start to get funny and strange things happen for all characters involved - Craig,Maxine,Lotte and the Malkovich himself.This was definitely an inventive film that one would surely find funny and entertaining.Also,it was nice to see John Malkovich tag along in a film that try to make fun of him.It was nice to see how people take advantage of getting inside his head to learn more about him especially the things that the well-known actor would do privately.Added to that,we are also treated to a new premise that made a film worthy of multiple viewings especially when it deals with a lot of funny themes that involved alter-egos,sexual fantasies,virtual realities,vanity and many others that one would surely find it new and refreshing for someone wanting something new in their movie-going experience.The performances were definitely great from Cusack,Diaz,Keener who got an Oscar nomination and Malkovich himself.Screenwriter Charles Kaufman and Director Spike Jonze definitely did a wonderful job of writing and directing respectively as the movie was well-made as it remained focused and centered despite of its various themes that will definitely add lots of enjoyment to the viewer.",Being John Malkovich

14,Hey_Sweden,"To be Malkovich, or not to be Malkovich. That is the question.",9,23 February 2020,"John Cusack plays Craig Schwartz, a nerdy puppeteer who goes to work as a file clerk. While at the office, he accidentally discovers a portal into the mind of the famed actor John Malkovich. This allows people who enter the portal to temporarily (for 15 minutes) experience the world through Malkovich's eyes. Craig finds that he really enjoys the experience, but his mousy, pet-obsessed wife Lotte (Cameron Diaz) loves it even more. Craig and co-worker Maxine (a sexy, memorable Catherine Keener) decide that they're going to exploit his find for everything that it's worth. This leads to various unforeseen circumstances.Written by the talented Charlie Kaufman, this is clearly one of the cleverest, most original feature film ideas to come down the Hollywood pike over the last 25 years. Directed with gusto by the equally talented Spike Jonze, a veteran of commercials and music videos making his feature debut, it's an engrossing, one of a kind journey. It turns decidedly darker in its second half, which requires some adjustment on the part of the viewer, but it never ceases to be interesting - and, of course, very funny at times. Malkovich himself in particular is a hoot, but the whole cast is great. Orson Bean plays Craig's boss, a genial, paternal figure, if also irreverent at times. Mary Kay Place is the amusing ""secretary"" at his office. Diaz is sympathetic in what was, at the time, a change-of-pace deglamorized role for her. Cusack shines in one of his more immersive performances, as a character who ultimately comes off as pathetic. Pay close attention to briefly see film director David Fincher on screen (he plays Christopher Bing).Kaufmans' script is quite entertaining, and proves to be involving every step of the way (it's more than just a ""gimmick"" movie). The most laudable element about it is its unpredictability: the viewer can't be 100% sure of where it's going much of the time. One definite highlight: characters chasing each other through what is supposed to be Malkovich's subconscious.Nicely scored by Carter Burwell, this runs close to two hours but NEVER gets boring, the mark of a truly great film.Nine out of 10.",Being John Malkovich
15,Calicodreamin,Weird,5,20 August 2020,"What in tarnation did I just watch? Maybe my small mind just couldn't comprehend the deeper meaning, but to me, this was weird. Besides the unusual storyline, the characters were well cast and well acted. Good cinematography.",Being John Malkovich
16,Boba_Fett1138,Malkovich? MALKOVICH! Malkovich.,9,11 August 2007,"Here it is, one of the most unique movies you'll probably ever watch.It's one of the best written scripts of all time, by the always inventive writer Charlie Kaufman, with also some totally great dialog in it. It's the sort of script you just can't go wrong with. No matter if you tell it poorly in the actual movie, the script itself still remains compelling and totally original on its own. Not that the story is told poorly in the movie by the way, to avoid confusion. Despite his lack of movie making experience, Spike Jonze shows that he's more than a capable director.Always wanted to see and feel the world through the eyes of John Malkovich? Just go to the 7 1/2 floor of the Mertin Flemmer building and enter the door behind the cabinet. This movie is weird yes but perhaps not as weird as you would expect. What perhaps most surprised me was the fact that the movie tried to make sense, as much as that was possible of course. It tries to explain things, without ever getting too philosophical or ever hard to follow. It's the sort of movie that can be interpreted in many ways, it definitely leaves more than enough room open for that but it's mostly above all a movie that you just have to take as it rolls along. Let things overwhelm you, just the same way as the situations overwhelm and happen to the characters in the movie. Don't try to understand everything weird that's happening in the movie, just take it all for what it is. Let the movie just simply draw you into this weird and unreal world. It's a much more accessible movie as you would expect and therefor this is a great movie to watch for basically just everyone. It's a rare case of a movie that's so odd that it becomes totally brilliant. Perhaps the only other real example of this is the Kubrick classic; ""A Clockwork Orange"". Through its weirdness the movie gets also incredibly innovative and helps to make this a totally awesome viewing experience. ""Being John Malkovich"" is also truly one of the coolest movies of recent years, without even trying to be cool. On the contrary actually. Most of the characters are losers, who aren't happy about their own current situation.It also is a very hilarious movie to watch. It's not a movie that tries to be funny it's a movie that just IS funny because of its situations and the way the characters deal with them. It's the type of movie thats fun and hilarious in its small and subtle little things. And of course the concept alone is already good enough to make you laugh. It therefor also is one of the better comedies of recent years. The movie probably kept me smiling all the way through, I believe.You'll probably have a hard time recognizing John Cusack and Cameron Diaz at first. They look so different from their normal type of roles. It such a great and big difference. And how great is that John Malkovich plays himself in a movie with a story such as this one. It takes some real guts to play a role such as this one. In a way he makes fun of himself and his career, just by playing himself. After this movie, you'll probably never look as John Malkovich the same way again. Lots of others stars also make a cameo appearance, such as Charlie Sheen in a bigger role and Sean Penn and Brad Pitt in cameo appearances as themselves. It probably only took 5 minutes of their time but it's so cool they actually did this.A greatly entertaining movie you really have to see- but above all; experience for yourself.9/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",Being John Malkovich
17,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,Bizarre... truly bizarre,8,21 December 2004,"I don't believe I've ever seen a movie that I had such a hard time understanding every second of, yet was drawn to at the same time. From the very first frame to the last, the film is bizarre and weird. The characters all act in a way that is quite hard to... 'decode' is probably the most accurate word here. Some act entirely uninhibited, some just act plain weird. I gathered that the whole portal into John Malkovich's head was a metaphor, but I couldn't make sense of all of the film. The plot is interesting and unbelievably bizarre, and quite difficult to follow. The pacing is a little slow, but that might just be because I had such a hard time understanding what was going on and why. The film has some truly memorable scenes, and even a few memorable lines. I'll never forget the famous restaurant ""Malkovich"" scene, and I doubt anyone else who've seen it will. The whole idea is great, and I think it's fairly original, as well. I didn't understand all of it, but I suppose I would if I were older, and had experienced a situation similar to that of one or more of the main characters, I would understand their actions more. This is a hard movie to comment on... especially since I don't entirely understand it. I will say that, while I found the ending to be slightly unsatisfying(which can probably be attributed to my being too used to Hollywood endings), I liked the deep, insightful commentary on love and emotions. What else is there to say... I might not be making a good case for the film, but I really do recommend you to watch it... if nothing else, it's a great unique movie that makes you really think. A very weird movie, but a very good one as well. I recommend it to just about anyone who is up for a new twist on one of the old love-story formula, and a good story that boils down to one of the most common fears among us humans. If you think you might like the movie for whatever reason, go see it. If you are smart enough to appreciate something slightly different from what you're used to see in Hollywood films, you'll most likely enjoy this. 8/10",Being John Malkovich
18,view_and_review,Catch it Now,7,18 December 2020,"""Being John Malkovich"" is just wacky enough and just ludicrous enough to be funny and not a farce. Why was John Malkovich the icon chosen for this piece I'll never know. I do know that in 1999 I didn't even know who John Malkovich was.While working on the 7 ½ floor of a company in New York, Craig Schwartz (John Cusack) found a portal to John Malkovich's brain where he could be John Malkovich only as a kibitzing host with no control. If what came before was insane, what followed was a real head banger. Craig found that he could be John Malkovich for up to fifteen minutes and then he'd be dropped on the side of a highway in New Jersey. Weird right?OK, it got weirder. Craig was in love with a woman named Maxine (Catherine Keener) though he was married to Lotte (Cameron Diaz). Craig shared his discovery with both of them, but only his wife decided to try the portal. She loved being Malkovich so much she was hooked. Then... get this... this one time when she was Malkovich and he was on a date with Maxine, Lotte fell in love with Maxine. Now both Craig and his wife Lotte were in love with Maxine. Furthermore, Maxine loved Malkovich when Lotte was being John Malkovich. Oh! It was such a tangled web. The web only got more tangled and it was a riot.

19,evanston_dad,Clever Conceit Runs Away with the Film,6,29 June 2010,"""Being John Malkovich"" announced the arrival of Charlie Kaufman as a major new talent among screenwriters, and though I've been resistant to much of his work, including this film, I can't deny that he's certainly established himself as a presence.""Being John Malkovich"" is a case of a film being too clever for its own good. The premise is a hoot -- a nerdy dude (John Cusack) discovers a portal that allows those who pass through it to live inside John Malkovich's head for a while. His mousy wife (Cameron Diaz) and new-found fling (a fetching Catherine Keener) want in on the action too, until word is out and there's a virtual stampede of people wanting to be Malkovich.The film is nothing if not original, and it's engaging to a point, but the screenplay gets ahead of Kaufman and the whole thing spins out of control.Malkovich plays himself and gives a performance so grotesque that it was almost unwatchable for me.Grade: B-",Being John Malkovich
20,AlsExGal,Three who deserved one another,9,7 July 2019,"I give my nine points for originality and the quality of production though, not the likeability of the characters. John Cusack and Cameron Diaz play Craig and Lotte Schwartz, a married couple that are going through the motions and don't seem to realize it. Cameron Diaz is made up to be so dowdy looking that she is initially not even recognizable. They live in a basement apartment crowded with animals (Lotte is an animal lover who works at a pet shop). Craig is a puppeteer who cannot find work in his chosen field and even gets beat up on the street for staging what one beefy dad thinks is a sacrilegious puppet show.At the suggestion of his wife, Craig goes looking for a regular job, and due to his fast hands he gets a job as a file clerk at LesterCorp. There he meets Maxine, a pretty but sociopathic young woman who, fortunately for society, seems to have no violent impulses, because if she did believe me she would follow them. Craig falls for her. Lotte falls for her. And they both make a play for her simultaneously when she comes over for dinner one night. She rejects them both.Maxine made it clear from the beginning she considered Craig a pathetic loser, but she needs him to exploit something that Craig discovered - a door that leads to a portal in which anybody who enters gets to ""become"" John Malkovich for fifteen minutes. At the end of the fifteen minutes the person is spit out on the side of the road at the entry to the New Jersey Turnpike. As a team they reopen Lestercorp at night and charge people 200 dollars apiece to ""become John Malkovich"". Neither of them knows what this portal is doing there behind a file cabinet and why it leads to Malkovich, but they initially don't care past its monetary value.It is part drama, part comedy, and even part horror and completely weird. And what the portal is doing there is all wrapped up in Dr. Lester, owner of Lestercorp, who is the only likeable character in the film, and even he has more than a bit of a Dr. Frankenstein/God complex.Also featuring Mary Kay Place as the object of Dr. Lester's lust who has convinced him he has a terrible speech impediment - he does not, John Malkovich as himself, and Charlie Sheen as himself and Malkovich's friend. It is great seeing Charlie Sheen when he was still healthy.Very highly recommended. But the plot is so weird you just have to let go of your reason and go with it.",Being John Malkovich

John Cusack plays a struggling puppeteer who applies for a filing job on floor 7 ½ in a strange building. Cameron Diaz plays his wife but he fancies Catherine Keener who is nonchalant to his existence. He eventually discovers a tiny door behind a filing cabinet and crawls inside only to be whisked away inside the mind of actor John Malkovich. For fifteen minutes he can experience the mind of Malkovich before being thrust into the gutter of reality. When Diaz ventures inside, she doesn't want to stop, and Keener sees an opportunity for profit. Brilliant work by director Spike Jonze. Cusack slowly deteriorates in his own greed. Diaz finds excitement and informs Keener through hushed cries, ""I'm a father!"" Keener allows Diaz to penetrate her through Malkovich who spoofs himself. Malkovich is a good sport and the question is answered as to what happens when he enters the door. Orson Bean plays Dr. Lester, the head of the organization whose friendly demeanor shelters a senile presentation. While the ending is twisted and somewhat disturbing on many levels due too its sexual exploits, Cusack's string puppets represent the ultimate manipulation in this highly original film.

22,The_Void,Absolutely sublime modern classic,8,5 July 2005,"Originality is one thing that I very much admire in cinema, and it's also the reason I rate Being John Malkovich so highly. Charlie Kaufman has taken an amazingly weird premise and twisted round a suitably offbeat story to create a movie that is as bizarre as it is as it is compelling, and it's definitely a major highlight of American cinema in the 1990's. Charlie Kaufman may have scripted his most acclaimed film in 2004 with Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, but if you want to see his best work - you need look no further than his first feature. Quite how anyone could have thought of this premise remains a mystery, but I'm certainly glad that Kaufman did. The story revolves around a portal that leads directly into the head of the actor, John Malkovich. After discovering this portal, puppeteer Craig Schwartz shares it with his colleague and crush, the beautiful Maxine Lund. Things start to get complicated when Craig's wife, Lottie, becomes involved and it turns out that Craig's not the only one with a crush on Maxine.The usually presentable John Cusack and Cameron Diaz are completely unrecognisable as this film's leading couple and both give career highlight performances. Catherine Keener fleshes out a threesome of leads. She is seductively sexy, and delivers a performance that reflects the quality of this film on the whole. And, of course, John Malkovich stars also. The fact that it's John Malkovich who is the title actor is what really makes this film. Had the film have been, say, 'Being Tom Cruise'; it wouldn't have had nearly the same impact. Malkovich is a big actor, but he's not THAT big and the fact that it's him takes the film away from the mainstream and allows it's offbeat indie roots to stay intact. Kaufman ensures that the story works by constantly adding new and weird events into the plot, and this in turn ensures that we never know what's coming next. Of course, this is exactly what you want from any film. The elements of the story aren't bound tightly enough to really make a lasting impression where substance is concerned; but it hardly matters, as there's enough offbeat invention in this film to more than adequately mask that fact It's easy to call this movie pretentious or silly; but it's also pointless. Being John Malkovich is a modern classic.",Being John Malkovich
23,zetes,The screenplay is a little screwy...,9,15 June 2000,"And I don't mean that the movie is weird. I like that. Everyone should appreciate the freshness of this movie. What I mean is that the screenplay is a little uneven. When I first saw this film (on opening day, luckily), I liked it a lot but felt that there was a major problem. It took me months to figure out why I felt this way, but I did finally figure it out, and I have confirmed it on subsequent viewings. The first half hour or so, all the screen time before the portal is found, contains an entirely different humor than the rest of the picture. And this humor is mostly childish and unfunny. The secretary and the joke about her being an expert on speaking disabilities was very unfunny. I feel embarrassed when I watch it it's so bad. The video about why the 7 1/2 floor exists is also extremely unfunny, as well as the 7 1/2 floor itself. I didn't find any of these things funny, and there were even more than that. I did like the puppet show that Craig gave on the street corner, I did like Dr. Lester's sexual rantings (although dirty old men jokes are really commonplace), and I laughed a lot when Craig was guessing Maxine's name.
Fortunately, when the portal is found, the childish humor pretty much completely vanishes. The rest of this movie is very intelligent. Every joke hits. There are no misses like there are in the first half hour.But what is really special about this film is how smoothly it becomes a compelling drama and character study. It is so well filmed. Watch how the Craig, Lottie, and Maxine dolls are used all through the film. I really felt it when Maxine was covering up the Lottie puppet. I actually teared up during the chase through Malkovich's subconscious, which I think is probably the single best scene that appeared in a film in 1999. And I also wept at the very, very, very beautiful ending. The second time I saw this in a theater, they cut out the beginning of the credit sequence where Emily was swimming, and I absolutely screamed, telling everyone in the theater about the sham that had been pulled. And I found the ending even more startling on the third viewing because I hadn't realized what actually happened to Craig at the end on my first and second viewings. I love this movie, so I am very hurt by the childish humor in the first half hour. It does embarrass me. It detracts from the whole film. Overall, I have to give it a 9/10.",Being John Malkovich

This is one of the most unique films I have ever seen!,9,19 June 2007,"I have heard non stop about how awesome Being John Malkovich is, basically I think that's why I had stayed clear of this film. I thought it might not live up to my expectations, due to the fact that I absolutely love the actor John Malkovich, I was afraid that this film might damage his name for me. But I decided to give this film a chance when my mom said that she liked it very much and to give it a shot, so I watched it with an ""open mind""... lol... get it? Eh, well, I got a pleasant surprise when I watched this film, it was fantastic. It was the perfect cast, amazing settings, incredible camera work, and not to mention a very unique story that was so interesting to watch.Craig and Lotte Schwartz are a ratty looking married couple. Craig is a struggling puppeteer and Lotte takes care of sick animals at their house. She asks Craig to get a real job, he ends up getting one, in this building as a filer where the ceiling is less than 6 feet tall. Everyone acts very strange, but he meets a beautiful young woman, Maxine, a player of her league. He becomes obsessed with her, well, everyone seems to naturally love her. Craig one day finds a portal that leads to the mind of actor John Malkovich and exploits it with Maxine. But Lotte becomes more obsessed with the portal and discovers a deeper side with it followed by a group of people.Being John Malkovich I would have to agree that it is one of those movies you just have to see. It's so strange but works on so many levels. The cast was just beyond perfect, I mean, you can barely recognize some of them, especially Cameron Diaz, what a role breaker. Her and John Cusack were absolutely great in the scene where they are fighting over Maxine and who truly loves her more. Well, the whole cast was great and I would highly recommend this film, it's great entertainment.9/10",Being John Malkovich
26,MovieAddict2016,"The director and actors of ""Being John Malkovich"" are having this dream, and to them it makes sense, but to the audience, it doesn't, because we are watching the dream from the outside - and that i",7,10 March 2003,"Being John MalkovichSome films released nowadays strive to be essentially original and in no way interesting. While ""Being John Malkovich"" is both original and interesting - to a certain degree - it is in no way a great movie.John Cusack plays a puppeteer named Craig, whom is married to a frizzle-haired woman named Lotte (Cameron Diaz). They live in a small apartment with exotic animals, including iguanas, parrots, and a chimp named Elijah, which has a repressed mental problem.Cusack's character gets a job in the classifieds as filer for a company with small overhead. (Literally!) He lusts after a fellow worker, named Maxine (Catherine Keener), but she ignores him.One day while he's working, a file drops behind a cabinet and when he goes to retrieve it, he finds a small door leading into a dark vessel. (Much like the rabbit hole in ""Alice in Wonderland."")After crawling through the hole-in-the-wall, Craig finds that it leads into John Malkovich's head. Yes, that's right, John Malkovich's head. Anyone who enters can see out of Malkovich's head for fifteen minutes.and maybe longer.After telling Lotte and his fellow associate Maxine about his wonderful and exuberating experience, Craig is lured into opening a small business centered entirely on the hole in the wall, and soon people from all over are entering John Malkovich's head for a large fee.But pretty soon, chaos ensues, and Diaz's character is entering Malkovich's head so she can be with other women. And as all this happens, Malkovich begins to suspect that something is going on - he is losing control over his own body. But why - and how?The film really has no sense of reality. It starts out with an odd feeling, but it is enjoyable. Everything is symbolic, and the surroundings bring out emotions in the characters. It's a bit like the beginning of ""Joe versus the Volcano,"" where Hanks practically lives in that stuffy office. Remember how dark and dank the office was? That's what John Cusack's office in the film is like - everyone must crouch over as to not hit the ceiling. But much like ""Joe versus the Volcano,"" the movie begins to withdraw itself into just plain crazy. Nothing makes sense at all, and the film starts to achieve a sick sense of reality. (Diaz turns into a lesbian, for one thing, and the film treats it like it is normal.)For example, when Diaz is having an affair with Keener, and Cusack's character knows about it, he doesn't seem to care a whole lot about the fact that his wife is cheating on him. It just doesn't make sense, really.
But I'll give the film the fact that it is strangely original and startlingly provocative. I mean, really, who ever thought about making a film where someone enters John Malkovich's head? And what about all the stuff later in the film? It is more than original - it is just plain.weird!John Cusack does a great job as Craig. He looks like a sixties hippy with his long, greasy hair and geeky countenance.Cameron Diaz is completely dissolved in her character. She looks so ugly and different in this film that you think, is that REALLY her?Catherine Keener, who was just in ""S1m0ne"" with Al Pacino, definitely got her career kick-started out of this film. I don't recall seeing her in many things before this movie.And John Malkovich is.well.John Malkovich.Director Spike Jonze does a good thing with the idea he is given, and the film uses so many ideas that they could fill at least ten movies themselves. Unfortunately, because of the way the film turns out to be, I didn't enjoy it that much.Maybe I didn't love it because I expected so much, and because it lost me half way through. I followed it in the beginning, and understood how everything was symbolic, but after the halfway point the film starts to not really make any sense and just gets weird. In one scene we see some individuals running through Malkovich's subconscious - what a weird scene!You know those dreams that you have sometimes - the kind of dreams that make absolutely no sense at all? But while you're having the dream, everything seems normal? That's what `Being John Malkovich' is - one of those weird dreams that make no sense but seem like they make perfect sense while you're dreaming them. Almost.Unfortunately, while the filmmakers treated the film like it made absolute sense while filming it, the audience can tell it doesn't make sense while they watch it - it is such that the audience is a bystander of the filmmakers' dream.The director and actors of ""Being John Malkovich"" are having this dream, and to them it makes sense, but to the audience, it doesn't, because we are watching the dream from the outside - and that is perhaps the biggest fault of the film.But it is, nevertheless, one of the strangest movies I have ever seen, and I have to give it some kind of credit for that. To not do so would be ignorant.3/5 stars -John Ulmer",Being John Malkovich
27,KineticSeoul,Intriguing and interesting,8,17 February 2010,"This is one of the most unique but awkward film I have ever seen. Just about every part of this film was intriguing and Cameron Diaz screaming ""suck my dick"" just kept on adding to the awkwardness in a good way. Okay so Craig(John Cusack) and Lotte Schwartz(Cameron Diaz) are old fashioned couple except Craig is a puppeteer. He soon gets a job at a odd office on 7 and a 1/2 floor and soon find a portal that leads to seeing through the eyes of John Malkovich for about 15 min and there is some odd love triangle thrown into this. This is a very imaginative film with elements of ""Alice in Wonderland"" as well and just about everyone puts on a good performance. At first you may find John Cusack of being the prick but the old people especially Dr. Lester is the bigger prick in my opinion.

29,ElMaruecan82,"An imaginative masterpiece with the most bizarre, yet profoundly intelligent, feeling ...",10,19 September 2011,"""Being John Malkovich"", what a title! I really didn't know what to expect exactly  an introspective film, some kind of intellectual drama essentially trying to capture the existential issues of the titular actor's tormented mind, I didn't think of a fantasy anyway, and certainly didn't anticipate this piece of cinematic creativity and visual awesomeness my mind would endure for less than two hours. ""Being John Malkovich"" is not only one of the most creative movies of the last 20 years, but certainly one of the cleverest and most mind-bending and twisted scripts ever concocted from a newcomer, his name is Charlie Kauffman, and this is definitely one of these reviews that must start by a thunder of verbal applauds for the writing.Though the movie is not the most quotable of all, like ""Network"" or ""Chinatown"", it features more similarities with scripts à la ""Rashomon"" or ""The Usual Suspects"", these intricate puzzles where you have to assemble each piece until the end, but in the case of ""Being John Malkovich"", it's less about a resolution or a revelation than how far a movie can exploit an inventive concept, how long it can hook the audiences' minds with an ingenious plot device. This is why the script is actually closer to movies like ""Back to the Future"" and ""Groundhog Day"". And when the plot consists on having people being in someone else's body, let alone John Malkovich, well, besides the thrills, besides the laughs, the movie should feature a necessary level of depth. Indeed, when you have such a goldmine for plot twists, you must handle them carefully and on that level, Charlie Kauffman did it with a remarkable craftsmanship. And even if you expect to be surprised, it's nothing compared to the exhilarating cinematic experience of the first viewing.The symbolism that structures the whole narrative is highlighted during the opening credits where you discover a marvelous puppet's number directed by Greg Schwartz, John Cusack whose appearance immediately labels him in the antihero 'slash' loser category. Greg is so devoured by his own passion that he's totally neglecting his couple. And despite the apparent love between Greg and his wife Lotte, there's the strong feeling that both belong to two different worlds, he works in the basement, taking care of his puppets with the delicacy of a God-like figure caring about his creations, while Lotte, live with her animals on the top, creating a touching mini-zoo in the house. The only similarity between the two is their looks, by the way, only after the first half hour, I realized it was Cameron Diaz below that huge afro. Even though she's not the most feminine cinematic character, she genuinely wants children, but Greg seems reluctant because of his unemployment, which Lotte understands  the film doesn't waste its time with these two wannabe-anything and quickly gets to the point, when Greg replies to a job offer.Greg's skillful hands get him the job in a peculiar and mysterious 'filling' company set, in the 7th and half floor, probably the lowest roof from any work place. Go figure why Kauffman decided to insert an element that wouldn't have changed much the plot. I guess this is the difference between talented and great directors, the low roof element created a bit of visual jokes to distract us before the third element of the future love triangle makes her entrance, Catherine Keener as Maxine, Greg's ambitious, sexy co-worker, she talks straightforwardly and doesn't embarrass herself with social hypocrisy. For a man who lives with a girl like Lotte, now I understand why Cameron Diaz had to look anything but sexy, he naturally falls in love with the scene-stealing Maxine, but she's not interested. Now, all the pieces are ready and the game can start when Greg accidentally discovers a strange tunnel that leads to John Malkovich's body. Why Malkovich? How does it work? Why fifteen minutes in his body? That's the charm, did you really want to know why the Groundhog Day was repeating itself? I was so delighted by the premise I couldn't wait to see where this would get, until the intelligence's highlight of the film was reached when Lotte was John Malkovich and when what followed set a whole new psychoanalytical mood. The film is not about being John Malkovich, but becoming another person. Greg discovers the ultimate puppetry, as a man who brings life to objects, now he can insufflate life to a human being, dictating his gestures, his thoughts, his sexual impulses, being God in a pervert sort of way. Is his fantasy the sublime allegory of puppetry's beauty or is puppetry the incarnation of a sordid and lusty desire? Maxine doesn't need the experience because she's naturally a controlling woman, and her desire is to control John Malkovich while he's controlled by either Greg or Lotte. And for Lotte, it's the epiphany, the flash of realization that she's not trapped in John Malkovich, but in her own body, discovering finally the sensation of being a man. Lotte loves animals, she loves life, it's all about the sensation of living again, while Greg uses people as objects to satisfy his personal impulses. Maxine is simply torn between these two approaches, which might explain why she appealed to both Greg and Lotte.The movie reveals our deepest fantasies or sexual torments, the desire to be the same person in another body, sometimes from a different sex, to have one person we love in another body  in both cases it's about the distinction between the mind and the body as a source of discomfort or satisfaction, and John Malkovich's body is the humble setting of a mind-blowing experimentation highlighting our conditions as clumsy puppets directed by our consciences whose strings are pulled by our subconscious or by other persons or by sex, by God, you name them. A anyway, the result is an existential masterpiece questioning our own control on our lives!Malkovich!",Being John Malkovich
30,paul2001sw-1,Delicatessan meets Monty Python,9,13 March 2003,"Being John Malkovich is one of the oddest, and most brilliantly original, comedies ever made.  John Cusack, brilliant as the anti-hero, is a depressed puppeteer who takes a job as a filing clerk in a very strange office.  The surreal detail, yet consistent atmospherics, of Cusack's life, are bleakly rendered in a sublimely low-key fashion. Then he discovers the strangest thing of all, a portal into the head of actor John Malkovich.  The rest of the film is more silly than truly surreal, and the tone more farcical, but it never rests on its premise, instead developing ever more layers, and finally delivers an appropriately nightmarish finale.In the vividness of its portrait of a grotesque world, the film resembles Delicatessan (and not just because of the monkey!).  For sheer insane originality, it brings to mind Monty Python (the original sketch shows, not the over-rated movies which lack the coherence and depth of Jonze's effort).

31,bowmanblue,Has to be seen to be believed,10,6 April 2020,"'Being John Malkovich' had to be one of the hardest films to get made. I can't imagine how the sales pitch must have gone. I figure writer (and possible madman?!) Charlie Kaufman must have used words like 'portal, puppets, low ceilings' and 'multitude of over-s3xed old people piling into the mind of a Hollywood actor.' Yes, all those things happen.You could simply describe the film as 'weird,' but that would probably do the film a great disservice. It's simply a masterpiece and possibly has to be seen to be believed. It's so bizarre and off-the-wall that you enter a world where anything can happen, but at the same time, seems somehow relatable and 'real.'I won't go into the plot in too much detail. First of all I would never want to spoil such a classic. Once you get into it you'll soon realise that the story could literally go anywhere and you'll only get the one chance at watching it without knowing how it will all end up. Secondly, if I gave a detailed plot synopsis you probably would think I'm making it up. It sort of centres around Craig (John Cusack) and his desire to be a puppeteer which isn't really making him or his wife (Cameron Diaz) any money. So he takes a filming job where he meets a sultry co-worker, Maxine (Katherine Keener) who he immediately falls for. However, what starts off as what could just potentially could be yet another love triangle soon goes off the rails when the trio discover a small tunnel in Craig's office which leads directly into John Malkovich's head. From there, things really get weird.All four of the central protagonists are brilliant and memorable in their own right (the fourth main cast member being of course - Malkovich - playing a warped version of himself as he struggles to figure out what's going on inside his head. There are a few peripheral characters too who also play their part and whose kookiness all help add to the surreal madness.For all 'Being John Malkovich's' brilliance, it's probably not a film you can have on in the background and fully appreciate. It's something you have to invest a couple of hours into to get the most out of it. And, if you do, I think you'll find a film that is just as good (and a damn sight more novel) than 99% of what comes out of Hollywood these days. However, if you're looking for a 'negative take,' I was once discussing this film with my friend and he didn't like it. I couldn't believe anyone could hate this film and, when I asked him what he found so bad, he simply said that the whole premise was too 'unrealistic.' What does he know, eh?",Being John Malkovich

There is nothing else like it, as is anything from Charlie Kaufman and Spike Jonze, two individual film makers who are not one bit afraid to take risks, which they did here to a significant degree. It certainly does not sound good on paper, two co-workers discover a portal to the mind of John Malkovich in their office building, but everything in it really works, the story will warp your mind in a way that you will enjoy. The only problem I had was that they glossed over Dr. Lester, who is beautifully portrayed by Orson Bean, his story, a very complicated one, could have been developed much more. The film has a surprisingly sweet and inspiring message, to be true to yourself, the person you want to be, to pursue your dreams and not to hold back on what you would like to achieve, you may find it strange how a story such as that could have such a powerful methapor to it, you will have to see for yourself. The cast is outstanding and are well able to handle the film's weirdness, John Cusack and Cameron Diaz deliver one of the best performances of their careers as two damaged soles, with an obsession with Catherine Keener, a mean, manipulative, deceiving woman you can not help but love. However, Malkovich is without a doubt the star of the show, portraying a very exaggerated version of himself, I would assume, being forced to change personalities and identities throughout for certain reasons, doing it all to full effect. Weird, whimsical and somewhat inspiring, Being John Malkovich is a movie that will leave you feeling a range of different emotions, all which you will enjoy, a must watch comedy drama.

38,The-Sarkologist,This movie will seriously do you head in (just like it did John Malkovich's),9,14 October 2011,"The thing that caught my attention about this film was not just its weird name but that is seemed to be about some minor, but reasonably good, Hollywood actor. John Malkovich is one of those actors that we have heard of but we are not really all that familiar with the films that he has been in (at least at the time of this movie because I am sure we have all heard of RED and Con-air). As such he is a bit more malleable than maybe a megastar like Mel Gibson.This movie is about the nature of ourselves, the idea of the soul, and the voyeuristic concept of being allowed inside somebody else. In this case it is very similar to Kathryn Bigalow's Strange Days, but somewhat more bizarre and more fantastic than that movie.The movie is focused around a group of people, a puppeteer (John Cusack, who I did not recognise), his wife (Cameron Diaz, who, once again, I did not recognise), and some strange woman name Maxine who loves John Malkovich only when the puppeteer's wife is inside him. The puppeteer gets a job at a filing office on the 7½ floor (which is half the height of normal floors) of a building. One day, while he is working, he finds a door that leads to a tunnel. He crawls down the tunnel and discovers that it is a portal inside the head of John Malkovich, where he remains for 15 minutes, and then is spat out onto the side of the New Jersey Turnpike.As such this film deals with the concept of the soul and the human body little more than a puppet. This is why the main character is a puppeteer because he comes to quickly control Malkovich as a puppeteer. We also learn that the portal is for a man, Dr Lester, who is actually a really old Irish Sailor, who uses the portal to go into another body when that body reaches a certain age. He has also learned how to take multiple people with him. In the end it seems that it is heading towards some sort of Buddhist reincarnation episode, where they are reborn into a new body (John Malkovich) and slowly but surely everybody will become a part of this person.This movie is so weird, funny, and deals with so many strange concepts, that it is impossible to get all of it in one viewing (as I have done) so, unfortunately I cannot say much more about it. Hopefully when I see it again, I might be able to explain more about it, so I will deal with it then.",Being John Malkovich
39,Dr_Coulardeau,Looking Backward Through the Looking Glass,8,30 December 2007,"The film is deeply funny because of the grossness of the concrete realization of the argument of the plot. It is muddy, dirty, crawling in a corridor, perverting in the most grotesque way Alice in Wonderland looking through the looking glass and sharing an apartment with an ill-mouthed parrot and a chimpanzee. The hole in the hedge is a rat hole in the wall and the only attractive thing in it is the glass doorknob. Then the plot is absolutely funny. It is based on one person being able to crawl inside another person and impose his or her personality onto that other person. That's strange but very fast it becomes ah ah because of the identity of the person inside and the identity of the person with whom the inhabited one is having relationships, discussions, rapports, even intercourse of course. In a way it is perverted since a woman can live her love for another woman by accepting her to be in the man that is the vessel of that intruder or invader. If the man is invaded by a woman and has a personal relationship with another woman, the two women are making love, to the point of procreating a girl, their daughter. That's definitely ah ah. Then the film deals with phantasms in the heads of Western men and women. Everyone wants to be able to make their desires and emotions towards anyone whatsoever real. But after all you have to keep some appearances, as a British TV series about a certain Mrs Bouquet used to say, and that's how the inhabited human vessel can enable so many possible connections to take place. Then it shows that success in our society does not depend on the value you have but on the value the public persona you are living in has. If you live in the body of a great person anything you will do will be successful and seen at once as great. Finally, and that's the punch scene at the end of the film, this possibility to transit from one person to another will enable some old people to get into younger bodies and live forever. The very fundamental myth of the Western world, but a myth they have never dared to realize in a religious belief or philosophical theory. The Buddhist did it but not the Christians, nor the Moslems, nor the Jews, the three Semitic religions. So Hollywood is playing the role of the provider of eternity to the few who will believe it because they have always dreamed of it. Blessed be the gullible,  So all in all a funny film that makes you feel at times kind of ill at ease.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris Dauphine, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne & University Versailles Saint Quentin en Yvelines",Being John Malkovich
40,zkonedog,Not What You'll Think From The Trailer,4,11 March 2017,"As a fan of mind-bending films like ""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind"" and ""Memento"", I was recommended this one on Netflix and decided to give it a try. Unfortunately, after being intrigued by the trailer, I found that this movie is not all all what is advertised.For a basic plot summary, ""Being John Malkovich"" sees an eccentric puppeteer (Jon Cusack) finding a portal that leads into the mind of actor John Malkovich (John Malkovich). Chaos then ensues when the experience is turned into a profit-making venture.Put simple, this is an artsy, ""concept"" film if ever one was created. Many themes in the film are interesting and have potential to really intrigue, but all are eschewed in favor of oblique artistic expression. Basically, it is impossible to ever ""figure out"" this film. The characters are outlandish, the plot is all over the place, and the themes are far too frequent and passing to piece together coherently.I liken the experience to watching Stanley Kubrick's ""The Shining"". The visuals are nice and the content seems thought-provoking, but you'll go stark raving mad if you actually try to figure everything out. For director Spike Jonze, the overall artistic expression far outweighs a coherent narrative.Thus, if you are a fan of out-of-the-box, visually striking film-making, this will be your ""Citizen Kane"". If, however, like me, you prefer some sense and stability, you will be disappointed (especially with the way it is advertised).",Being John Malkovich
41,Red-125,Not my kind of movie,1,20 November 1999,"""Being John Malkovich"" left me cold.  Actually, it turned me off.  The basic premise was interesting, but it was all downhill from there.  This movie contains significant scenes of violence against a woman.  This violence is gratuitous; it doesn't really stem from preceding scenes and the perpetrator is not portrayed as particularly reprehensible.  Apparently a lot of people liked this film.

Movies are too much the same old, same old these days, so it's refreshing to see a movie that is far from that.The casting is excellent.John Cusack, this now forty year old actor, does excellent job in the lead.His acting is never bad.Cameron Diaz is fabulous as Lotte.Catherine Keener does great job as Maxine.Charlie Sheen makes a visit as Charlie.Sean Penn and Brad Pitt pop in as themselves.Then there's of course John Malkovich playing John Horatio Malkovich.I wonder what they would have done if John hadn't accepted the part.Maybe the title would have been Being...something, something. The movie offers lots of funny scenes.I laughed a long time when John went into his own head.And then there are the apes.It can also be dramatic from time to time.Being John Malkovich is a fine example of combining comedy and tragedy.Those two walk hand in hand in the movie as they often do in life.In the movie all those people want to go into the head of a movie star because they want to be someone else for a while.In real life you can't be anybody else.You're stuck with yourself.All you can do is act.But it won't do no good.Be yourself.Being yourself is the best you can do.",Being John Malkovich

44,jzappa,Everyone is Searching for Who They Are and Who They Want to Be,9,18 April 2008,"What makes Being John Malkovich provoke so deeply is that it is not simply an oddball flight of fancy but an exploration of Charlie Kaufman's deeply realized questions and thoughts explored through the story. However, the film is certainly pathological in its exploration of themes and modus operandi in ways that are not done in American movies. Its romantic plot strands, its ending, the subplot of revitalizing the art of puppeteering, and the nonchalance of the characters' workplace having low ceilings because of being placed between two normal floors are all either far-reachingly hilarious eccentric ideas much like ones one may conjure when half asleep yet still conscious and visions and even scenarios bleed into your actual environments, or they are aggressively resentful of pat plot tunes.Cusack very comfortably plays a character created by forces not afraid of a hero who's blunderingly unsuccessful with women or not very socially popular. A dark territory where ego has to reach a little bit to get a hold, Cusack, Kaufman, and director Jonze knew that more people would identify with him much more intensely and honestly than a confident, clever, attractive man. He's the id of the creators of the traditional leading man and consequently the men who've grown up latently emulating them. Cameron Diaz has the same attitude towards her role, the personification of the basic drives, feelings, and impulses of the most head-turning social women. Kaufman's characters are amoral and egocentric, ruled just by pleasure and pain.Like all films, there is the love interest, and subsequently the love triangle, but it's not there to fill in any blanks. The female characters are not decoration but very invigorating and thought-provoking characters. Catherine Keener, owner of the most beautiful smile ever captured on film, eats up the screen, just as I would like her to do with me, as a cruelly unattainable object of desire, rejecting not as a reaction but as a first move.Jonze was wise not to employ the safety net of the inventive and meticulously coordinated style of the fascinating music videos he has directed, and instead trusts the effect of Kaufman's inspiring script to stand alone without disaffecting visual technique lathered on top. This film is a highly admirable and important onslaught that hopefully by now has hemorrhaged its influence into the much expressed overcommercialization and underused creativity and exploration of American cinema.",Being John Malkovich
45,Vartiainen,I don't get it,2,9 September 2015,"At first this movie seems great. I actually thought for a while that this might be a Terry Gilliam film, with its bizarre sets, odd characters and dystopian set designs and aesthetics. It was not, but it seemed like it, and the first third of the film was immensely enjoyable as we slowly get to know this strange world.And then they went nowhere with it. Sure, there is a portal that leads into John Malkovich's head. But what they do with it is the least imaginable thing. And why even John Malkovich? The writer Charlie Kaufman has said that Malkovich was always his first and only choice, but I just don't see why. He certainly stands out because of his looks, and he has the acting skills to play the different people inhabiting his head, but aside from that there's nothing interesting about him shown in this film. He lives in an apartment, tries out for roles and that's it.Plus the fact that the main character is a puppeteer. Okay, at first that's interesting. It's out there, not something we see in every movie and jives well with the whole bizarre first third the movie has. But then it is stretched way out of proportion, with much of the running length dedicated to odes to puppetry. Why? Sure, there's the joke about the ultimate puppet, but there needs to be more than that. Now it barely connects with anything.Then there are the romance subplots, which are passable, though boring, and mainly there to move the plot along. The final truth about the portal is also pretty lame. It's pretty much what you would guess if you sat and thought for a minute.All in all Being John Malkovich was a huge disappointment for me. If you have a story about a portal that allows you to control a real life Hollywood star, go all out. Don't give us this halfway there balderdash. Be Terry Gilliam. Make it as weird as possible. Attempting to put logic and cohesive narrative into it only waters it down.",Being John Malkovich
46,freemantle_uk,A strange yet funny film,9,11 May 2010,"Indie cinema is often known for some really quirky and strange ideas; but few can come stranger then Being John Malkovich, an excellent debut film for Spike Jonze and Charlie Kaufman.Craig Schwartz (John Cusack) is a skillful, but unemployed puppeteer, living with his pet-obsessed wife Lotte (Cameron Diaz). Struggling for money Craig takes a job as a filing clerk on a strange, low-ceilinged 7 ½ floor in the Mertin Flemmer Building, New York City. He seems skills at the job, but he falls for another worker, Maxine (Catherine Keener), who do not share his feelings. Whilst working Craig finds a strange portal which allows him to be insight John Malkovich's (John Malkovich) head and his experience what he sees and feels for 15 minutes before landing by the New Jersey Turnpike. He tells Maxine who at first thinks he is mad but quickly sees it as a money making opportunity. Lotte too finds out and she uses the portal to live out her transgender fantasies. Quickly a three way conflict starts up and when Malkovich starts to have some very strange experiences he is thrown into the mix.In the late 90s, early noughties, some American films took a very surreal turn, Mulholland Drive was an excellent example. But whilst Mulholland Drive was played pretty straight, Being John Malkovich took a much more comic approach. There were funny lines throughout, but Jonze and Kaufman use the surrealism for comic effort as well, like when Malkovich climbs into the portal inside his own head. Being John Malkovich is a cleverly written film that is looks at the psychology of what makes the mind work and the ideas of identity. This is also at times a very dark film with it characterisation and raises some dark moral questions at the end. But it works because it is a very intelligence and it was well directed by Jonze who knows his way around a set-piece.There is a unusual cast in this film. Cusack is known for being a indie star, he is really well known for doing comedy. He was well casted as the lead character and shows his talent. Diaz was unrecognisable as sad, mentally confused wife who is the most tragic and sympathetic character in the piece: it also shows how a difference hair style and set of clothes makes to someone's appearance. Keener was decent as a bitchy, loathsome character for most of the film but at times her acting did slip. Malkovich also shows he has a talent to play himself. Politically he is a moron, but he is a very talented actor and I can set outside my political issues when watching him. Orson Bean too was very good as the mysterious Dr. Lester and he had excellent comic timing.A very entertaining but strange film.",Being John Malkovich
47,dfranzen70,"Weird movie, but in a good way!",9,19 February 2000,"After seeing this film, the first word that came to my mind was ""weird."" This is a WEIRD movie. But! I mean that in a good way. For one thing, it's very original, and that's certainly something that's been lacking in Hollywood for a long time. It's about this talented, down-on-his-luck puppeteer (John Cusack)who accepts a meaningless job for a company that operates on the 7 1/2 floor (you have to see it to believe it, trust me) and discovers in his office a portal that takes him to the mind of actor John Malkovich. Not to Malkovich's HOUSE, mind you, not to his office, but into his actual mind. Yes folks, it's an existential conundrum of a movie. What's it like to be John Malkovich, you wonder? Watch and learn, Gentle Viewer, watch and learn. We see John in the morning, making himself some breakfast, we see him rehearsing at a local theater, we see him hitting on the ladies, and we see him commiserating with Charlie Sheen, of all people (I didn't even know they ran in the same circles!). But being in John Malkovich's head is only one of the issues at hand - how this all affects the puppeteer's girl (an unrecognizable Cameron Diaz) and his newfound partner (Catherine Keener) and how THEY interact is even more intriguing. This isn't a movie the likes of which you've seen before, you see. Just when you think you have stuff figured out and you can settle down and gnaw on some stale pretzels, something else weird happens to make you have to rethink it again.This is certainly not a movie for all tastes, just as ""Eraserhead"" wasn't a movie you'd recommend to everyone you know.

They would go to any extent,cross any limits and perform any task in order to perpetually bask in glory.The audience gets to get a grip over some of truly wacky artists'lives.Everybody would like to become famous and would even pay for it.This funny aspect has been shown to make all human beings realize that strange are the vagaries of human mind.",Being John Malkovich

John Cusack and Cameron Diaz are unrecognizably pedestrian as a mismatched husband and wife at the end of their rope, both after the same thing in spite of one another. Their marriage, and the factors that lead to its quick, sad disintegration, may be the traditional center of the story, but along the way the plot jolts in so many wildly different directions that it's actually rendered secondary. Like a journey through the mind of a creative genius with serious ADD, it samples a dozen concepts strong enough to power their own film, then still finds a way to somehow marry them all into a single adventurous, mostly coherent, finale.

Yes, the title is `Being John Malkovich' but it's more about  being reborn into another person and therefore living forever.  Cusack plays a puppeteer who can't get work in this profession until he finds a portal in his new job's office that leads him into the title character's mind.  This soon becomes a profitable experience for him and his partner and lust/love interest and they are selling tickets for $200 a pop to enter in.  There is much more to this movie including Cusack's attempt to hold on to his wife and later his girlfriend.  His wife, played by Cameron Diaz, and her trip and discovery into being a lesbian thru Malkovich's mind and much much more.  What makes this movie good is it's complexity although it's direction is confusing.  It starts out as a comedy, but ends as an eerie supernatural thriller.

53,noralee,Incomparably Inventive and Uniquely Funny,10,28 October 2005,"""Being John Malkovich"" is a laugh out loud, creative hoot.It is incomparably inventive.With Kaufman writing the script particularly with the titular actor in mind it's hard to think of what other actor's persona would fit in as well, as Malkovich's protean roles leaning toward the bad guys makes for an effective back-story that say another wouldn't work as well. It was like a Monty Python cartoon come to life -- completely unpredictable and creative in every scene and in every angle and detail.

54,NateWatchesCoolMovies,"Quirky stuff. Not for everyone, but hilarious to those who get it",8,11 January 2016,"Charlie Kaufman is a one of a kind storyteller, and for years now has been one of the most beguiling, uniquely creative voices in film, a man whose entire thought process and writing technique truly lie in a realm that's perpetually out of the box. Now, his stuff isn't for everyone, particularly the average film-goer who isn't ready to sing, or rather, 'think for their supper', so to speak, when it comes to payoff. But for those willing, there's cerebral wealth, hidden pockets of emotional truth and endless story beats that play out like curveball eureka moments and make us ever curious as to how the map of the man's brain plays out when he's spinning his work. Whether a bona fide masterwork (Eternal Sunshine Of The Spotless Mind, an all timer for me) or a cacophonic dud (Adaptation, a painfully nonsensical misfire) the guy's pen never strays into generic narrative mud. Being John Malkovich is perhaps his oddest entry yet, and believe me it's hard to settle on one to occupy that pedestal. In this one, John Cusack plays a bedraggled puppeteer who lands a job at a weirdo company called LesterCorp, a five foot tall office space located in between the 7th and 8th floors of a high rise. Their he meets sexy Catherine Keener, who throws a wrench in his lifeless marriage to frumpy, pet store owner Cameron Diaz. That's nothing compared to the film's central plot though, a trip into a head scratching metaphysical twilight zone that's equal parts amusing and disturbing. Cusack inadvertently finds a hidden portal which leads directly into the mind of movie star John Malkovich, for a few minutes at a time before dumping the cranial voyager out on the New Jersey turnpike. It's a concept so off the wall and disarming that you kind of have no choice but to roll with the punches and see where it goes, out of sheer curiosity alone. Malkovich plays himself in belligerent, over anunciating glory, and the scene where he inevitably ventures into the portal himself is deranged brilliance worthy of the surrealist hall of fame. Not all of Kaufman's quirks come out unscathed, as we begin to see the deliberation to be weird for the sake of weird shine through the frays in the blanket of authentic inspiration. But when it works, it really works, riding a wave of restrained absurdity that kicks into outright mania when you least expect it.",Being John Malkovich

Then he stumbles onto a portal that leads him inside the mind of a real-life puppet, none other than the famous screen actor John Malkovich.Oh, and he and his wife fall in love with the same woman, who is carrying a baby that's also the only portal to future earthly existence for a dirty old man and his aging friends.""Being John Malkovich"" is a high-concept comedy alright. Like Craig the puppeteer, it wants to raise issues in its askew way. I see it as a meditation on selfishness, puppetry being a metaphor for one imposing their will upon another. Craig selfishly throws his wife over for another woman, his wife throws him over for the same woman, and that woman is more selfish than the two put together. Of course, none of them get what they want. Meanwhile, the selfishness of the old man and his friends is homicidal since it involves the obliteration of another human being mind and soul.Whatever the big idea, it is well-developed with help from a cast that includes John Cusack, Catherine Keener, and John Malkovich, who plays himself as well as Cusack's Craig Schwartz when the latter is inside of him. Malkovich doing Cusack doing Malkovich is some fine acting.While too high-concept to reach for its laughs, ""Being John Malkovich"" doesn't forget to be funny. The Mertin-Flemmer early-80s orientation film is as great a send-up of bad acting as ""Inside Amber Waves"" was in ""Boogie Nights."" In addition to Malkovich, who is complemented warmly on his performance as ""that retard,"" Charlie Sheen and Sean Penn have goofy cameos as themselves; Penn admitting he worries his own move into puppetry will be seen as slavish imitation of Malkovich. Brad Pitt throws in a single facial expression that slays me.It's also amusing how the film plays up the ordinariness of Malkovich's life. He doesn't do much more then eat toast and order periwinkle bathmats, yet as Craig sells people tickets inside Malkovich's mind his customers emerge invariably joyous at the significance they've experienced. When Craig completes his hostile takeover of Malkovich, he decides to remake the actor as a puppeteer, and thus we are treated to a People magazine cover of a brooding Malkovich and the headline: ""I will act no more forever."" Somehow I don't think that would happen in reality, but of course playing with reality is where the fun is here.Cameron Diaz is a real find in this film, as she plays the frowsy wife in a style akin to Louise Lasser's Mary Hartman. While Diaz's roles often play off her incredible beauty alone, ""Being John Malkovich"" is the one time she is called upon to really act, and she pulls it off, so much so it distracts from the fact her character is the most underwritten in the movie, more of a gag than anything else.The resolution of the story feels contrived as well, not as amusing or coherent as the rest of the film, though the ending itself is solid. Seeing Craig's state in the end is a nice comment on his chosen career, though he doesn't do as badly as poor John.One great thing about this movie is Orson Bean as the old man. Here's a guy I haven't seen in 20 years, and that was in a Q-Tip commercial, yet here he plays a central role and gets most of the laughs in a pretty funny film. ""I don't want to be your link to history, boy, I want to feel my naked thighs next to Floris.""

59,EUyeshima,One of the Most Wildly Inventive American Movies Shows Film-making Brio and Genuine Heart,10,11 September 2006,"If anything, I enjoy the audacity and manic creativity of this 1999 black comedy more now than when it was first released. Screenwriter Charlie Kaufman, who sends up the creative block he experienced after writing the film's script in 2002's ""Adaptation"", plainly refuses to use any accepted cinematic convention to tell the wildly eccentric story of Craig Schwartz, a downtrodden puppeteer who has a must-be-seen-to-be-believed adventure. An uncompromising artiste who cannot find work within his craft, he decides to accept a job as a file clerk to please his frumpy, animal-loving wife, Lotte. Things immediately go awry when he sees his place of employment is on the dwarf-sized 7 1/2th floor of a Manhattan office building. He becomes drawn to an ice-cold co-worker, an apparent femme fatale named Maxine, but the story really escalates into high gear when he discovers a secret passageway that turns out to be the consciousness of actor John Malkovich.The plot convolutions only get weirder yet strangely more resonant as Craig and others get to experience ""being John Malkovich"", including the actor himself. What subsequently happens is constantly off-kilter, but Kaufman brings perceptive insight into all the major characters in ways that are completely unpredictable. The beauty is that repeated viewings only bring out plot nuances that were not as apparent the previous times. Director (and sometime actor) Spike Jonze is an inspired choice to lead the proceedings since he lends an almost verité-style to the film making the lunacy seem human-sized. Casting is pure gold with a bedraggled-looking John Cusack appropriately awestruck as Craig, a cast-against-type Cameron Diaz energized by her curiosity as Lotte and Catherine Keener sharply feline as Maxine. Orson Bean brings out all the eccentricities of Craig's oddly deranged boss, and no one is better cast than Malkovich as a wildly narcissistic version of himself, especially as the plot spins further into a Freudian fantasy of monstrous proportions.This is wildly inventive film-making that may alienate several viewers, but it really should be embraced as the kind of bold experimentation that mainstream Hollywood rarely attempts. The 2002 DVD extras are also pure gold, including an interview with Jones conducted under mock-stress; a brief featurette, ""An Intimate Portrait of the Art of Puppeteering,"" that spotlights the behind-the-scenes work performed by puppet master Phil Huber; and a short called ""Intimate Portrait of the Art of Background Driving"", which purportedly documents the experiences of extras driving cars in the New Jersey Turnpike scenes where all of the Malkovich travelers end up. Along with the original theatrical trailer and several TV promotional spots, there are also two played-straight videos, excerpts of which are shown in the film - one the ""7 ½ Floor Orientation"" and the other the vaunted pseudo-documentary, ""American Arts and Culture Presents: John Horatio Malkovich, Dance of Despair and Disillusionment"".

He finds a door in his office that leads to John Malchovich (an actor) and he becomes his conscience. His wife tries it out and finds out that she is a lesbian. By the way, you can only go in for 15 minutes. Catharine Keener then goes on a date with John Malchovich when Cameron Diaz is in him (So she's going out with him and her as his conscience) John Cusack finds out how to control John Malchovich and it works. He stays in him for about eight months. Bizarre, huh? Catharine Keener is also a lesbian in the end. She gets pregnant by Malchovich while Diaz is in him, so it's their lesbian love child. The question is, why is their a door to Malchovich? It's because these old people are trying to live forever by going from body to body, taking over minds. In my opinion, the ending is brilliant. It ends where Cusack took the next body available and got trapped forever in her conscience with no control. It's a weird but fun movie. The most interesting scene is when Malchovich goes into his own portal and sees the world where everybody has his face (But women still have boobs and they wear their own clothes) The only word they can say is malchovich. It's a movie I don't like, but I respect greatly. Charlie Sheen briefly plays Charlie, Malchovich's actor friend, who is in a couple of scenes. The scene he's in at the end shows him in eight years balding. This movie is not for all, but all should respect it. My rating: 4 out of 5.",Being John Malkovich
61,aidanratesmovies,One Incredibly Bizarre Journey,8,1 September 2020,"Entertaining, sublimely odd, and uniquely original- Being John Malkovich isn't necessarily a great film, but one of the most bizarre and quirky films I have ever come to see. The writing can be a bit all over the place, but for the most part, it is a wacky joke filled satire facing complex characters with existential crisis'. Its acting is quite good, notably from the titular star himself and Catherine Keener as per usual. Cameron Diaz and John Cusack both give roles that are far out of their comfort soon however, and are both memorable perscenes on screen as well. The look of the film can be rather dull, but realistic. It isn't going for anything quite memorable in those departments, and though its plot is very engaging and interesting to follow, a bit of it feels dissapointed by the lengths it promises but never seems to go. The film feels very odd in a tonal and atmospheric way, and though it is not anything too drab, I did feel it impacted my overall opinion on the film itself. Spike Jonze does do a good job crafting this flick, but Kaufman's script doesn't seem as complete as other works he had done such as Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind. In the end, Being John Malkovich is a film experience you will never forget, and though it isn't perfect, it certainly is worth watching for more than a few reasons.
My Rating: 9/10",Being John Malkovich
62,Enchorde,"Very peculiar, very creative",7,7 January 2005,"** HERE BE SPOILERS ** Craig Schwartz (Cusack) is a skilled puppeteer, but that doesn't pay the bills. He takes a strange job at a company located at the 7½ floor in a building. There he meets the attractive Maxine (Keener), and he gets two problems. First, he is attracted to this Maxine, but he is married to Lotte (Diaz) and second, Maxine is not at all attracted to him. However, when he discovers a secret door, that leads straight into the mind of John Malkovich they start a company that sells the experience. Naturally John Malkovich gets confused, and later not at all happy about it. Things complicate further when Lotte falls in love with Maxine. Maxine is attracted to Lotte too, but only when she is inside Malkovich. And then it gets really complicated...This a extremely peculiar movie, in a creative way. Ideas and scenes are presented in a new refreshing way, thus making the story very entertaining. The actors and actresses are good but somewhat overshadowed by the story. I believe that this is the kind of movie that you either dislike or really enjoy, and one must see for oneself. I enjoyed though...7/10",Being John Malkovich
63,Agent10,Genius,9,28 April 2002,"I'm at a loss for words with this film. How does something so odd, so unique not get any mention in the annals of brilliance and genius. Hollywood maybe has seven or eight types of movie ideas that are repeated ad nauseum, but Being John Malkovich somehow managed to stay away from those predetermined molds. Spike Jonz made a fine effort in his film debut, and the whole conundrum of the film created an interesting question. This film could easily have been some cornball flick called Being Tom Cruise or something. Yet it stayed true to its form, commenting on our obsessiveness to be someone else, to be something greater than our 9-5 jobs and big screen TVs. So many things to talk about, and so many things to look at a second time.",Being John Malkovich
64,Spleen,Good stuff - only just misses out on being first-rate,6,5 January 2000,"The story could easily have been published in `The Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction', or (this is less of a compliment but certainly not a criticism) `Asimov's'.  Anyone who liked the movie should certainly look through these publications, and others like them.  Both magazines are still very much alive and it's a pity they're not read more.  But for maximum pleasure, do try to find some copies of `Fantasy and Science Fiction' from its glory days of the 1950s and 1960s.  (Please don't do this if you live in Australia, because I'm trying to track down old copies myself.)Indeed, the story would probably have reached its ideal type in literary form, so it's a pity Kaufman DIDN'T submit it to the magazines - they wouldn't have paid as much, but he could always have made a screenplay out of the idea later.  Some aspects (like the thirteenth-and-a-halfth floor, and the puppetry) are well suited to cinema, but the central conceit would be better served by the written word.  How does one SHOW, visually, that Craig is receiving all the sensory information that John Malkovich is receiving?  I don't thing Kaufman and Jonze quite solve this problem.There are people out there who think that good plots, intelligent dialogue, consistency and cleverness are all purely literary virtues, of no particular value in the cinema.  This is a silly view.  Any work of art that has a plot can be judged according to the quality of its plot; any work of art capable of manifesting intelligence can be judged according to how intelligent it is.  Speaking of which, I do have one quibble ...As everyone knows, there's this tunnel; and when one gets to the end of the tunnel, one experiences whatever John Malkovich is experiencing.  What happens when John Malkovich himself enters the tunnel?  The film offers an answer, and it's pretty lame.  Not that I know myself what would happen.  I guess it's under-determined.  But here's a thought: suppose there's a time-delay, so that a person in the tunnel experiences whatever Malkovich experienced, say, 0.01 seconds earlier.  THEN John Malkovich entering the tunnel would experience 0.01 seconds of John Malkovich entering the tunnel, again and again, and maybe each copy of the experience would be more degraded than the last.I can't think of anything wrong with the details of the story.  It's because of the story that `Being John Malkovich' is so good, if not the masterpiece everyone seems to think it is.  The cinematic prose could do with a bit of a re-write.",Being John Malkovich
65,Seraphion,A crazy story yet very much entertaining,7,26 September 2014,"The movie starts very curiously with the puppet dance sequence. The next sequence about the house full of various pets even more intrigued me while watching. The story keeps on building the stupid ideas with the floor number and the literal manifestation of it. And when the real John Malkovich comes in, well, its just the real start of the craziness. The movie depicts various bad values people tend to choose in order to indulge themselves; from homosexuality, unfaithfulness, to organized crime of some sort (the mob of old men rushing to John Malkovich's body). The acting is nice. John Mlakovich can keep his hard and peculiar character even though he plays the shocked character. John Cusack, Catherine Keener and Cameron Diaz all played their parts very well, defining the crucial angles for the story.",Being John Malkovich
66,Galina_movie_fan,"""Meet you in Malkovich in one hour""",10,19 April 2007,"Being John Malkovich (1999), the Spike Jonze's directorial debut, is an amazing film - hip, inventive, delightfully weird, incredibly funny and disturbingly serious with the gleefully absurd plot twists. Let's face it, that was a stroke of genius - to throw together the tragic medieval lovers, Abelard and Heloise in the street show created by a talented puppeteer Craig Scwartzh (John Cusack) with the nimble fingers but out of work in ""today's wintry economic climate"", Elijah the Chimp with the mental problems that go back to his childhood, the surreal office that is located on the 7 1/2 store of a New York City office building and a floor is four feet high. Add Cameron Diaz (Craig's animals loving wife Lotte), completely unrecognizable, aging and balding Charlie Sheen, cynical and practical Maxine (Catherine Keener), who had an unique experience of having two people looked at her ""with complete lust and devotion, through the same pair of eyes"", and send them all to the wild ride inside the famous and respectable actor John Malkovich's brain to see what he sees and to feel what he feels, to the trip that would last 15 minutes and end up in a ditch on the side of New Jersey Turnpike.This is just the beginning...Oh, and what John Horatio Malkovich feels with all the travelers in his head and what he sees when he enters the portal to his own brain, you have to find out for yourself! What drug were Charlie Kaufman and Spike Jonze on?! Not even two hours long, the movie never ceases to surprise and entertain. ""Being John Malkovich"" is a fascinating and truly original film which I love and always enjoy watching even if there were never a connection with any of its characters (with the exception of Abelard and Heloise and Elijah the Chimp).",Being John Malkovich
67,RainDogJr,Eternal life,9,19 May 2008,"This film is just magnificent. It has many different themes and makes that you can find so many different ways to enjoy it. It may be seen as a portrait of a relationship, work and love but most notorious as a portrait of the human mind. In the end is a science fiction film that uses that to make a better study of the mind upon an amazingly original story full of creativity.That story begins with Craig Schwartz (John Cusack), a great puppeteer who has no luck and no work. Lotte (Cameron Diaz) is his wife who loves pets having many of them in their house. As I write, Craig's abilities as a puppeteer were really good but that wasn't enough to obtain a job so he decides to take a job as filing clerk. When Craig enters for the first time in the 7½ floor of the building where he will work, we start to feel that this is going to be really weird, even that may be a reasonable explanation of why they made a floor between the 7th and the 8th floors is just so bizarre and really hilarious to watch a floor in which the employees cannot stand upright. Maxine (Catherine Keener) works there too and soon will be the love desire of Craig. Also we meet Lester (Orson Bean), the new boss of Craig who only talks about his wet dreams.So we have this four main characters whose personalities will be different after Craig discover a portal. Here is when the weird story, written by Charlie Kaufman, really begins with this portal that can take you to the mind of John Malkovich so for 15 minutes you can be witness of what this actor do through his eyes. Upon that we have a really interesting view to the different behaviour of Craig, Lotte and Maxine, after they know about the portal. Craig only thinks in the human mind and many philosophical-type questions, Maxine looks this portal just as a business and Lotte is the first one who feels a sort of addiction to that experience finding through Malkovich the man inside her. Here the film is hilarious having a couple, Craig and Lotte, in love with the same woman, Maxine. Lotte and Maxine will find a connection between them but only when Lotte is ""inside"" Malkovich and because Malkovich is just so innocent well he doesn't care if Maxine call him Lotte. Suddenly the film turns even weirder and more interesting when Malkovich is no longer Malkovich in consequence of having a puppeteer inside his mind. Finally Craig can be near Maxine who is still a very strange character being just taking advantage of the circumstances. The end is nothing but brilliant with the real plans of Lester, Maxine having a ""normal"" life with Lotte and with the eternal life as a possible thing leaving Malkovich just as another victim and Craig completely lost.About the cast: Everybody here did just a terrific work. Even that I'm not a fan of John Cusack I loved his performance as a confused puppeteer with a big obsession. The beautiful Cameron Diaz looks really different in the first part of the film and she is just great. I will always recognize Catherine Keener because of the film ""Living in Oblivion"" and here is terrific in a very strange character. John Malkovich as himself is fantastic, first is just fun but later he end being a victim in this cruel but brilliant conclusion. And my favourite cameo is the one of Charlie Sheen, giving advices to Malkovich about hot lesbian witches; just hilarious as his new look after seven years. Also Sean Penn is in the film, talking in the TV show about the new phase of Malkovich as a puppeteer.Conclusion: Hilarious, interesting, moving, entertaining and so damn unique. It is fantastic how Spike Jonze and Charlie Kaufman, more specific the last one, created a unique and bizarre world with those surrealistic and weird situations and, upon that, they created a very human story showing how we find irresistible to prove how does it feels to be someone else, in this case a person with fame, and also how this persons left everything, of course including their own personalities, to get some fame or to be young again. A really interesting portrait of the human mind. So for me ""Being John Malkovich"" is nothing but another reason to remember the year 1999 as a wonderful year for Cinema. What a great film this is!Region 4 DVD: Another great single-disc release by Universal Pictures. It contains many extras and a very original menu. Some of the extras are the trailer, four imaginative and funny TV spots, the complete videos of the story of the 7½ and the story of the ""new"" John Malkovich (in the film both videos are seen on TV), the art of puppeteering, Spike's photo album and some others. The interview with Spike Jonze is definitely unique but actually he doesn't answer any question. Anyway, watching this film on this terrific DVD just left me a lot of desires to get the DVD of ""Adaptation"" (2002) as soon as I can.",Being John Malkovich
68,philip_vanderveken,There just aren't enough words to fully describe this movie.,9,16 December 2004,"I've seen quite a lot of movies, including some weird ones (Lost Highway for instance), but this one is by far the weirdest that I've ever seen. There just aren't enough words to fully describe this movie.A puppeteer doesn't earn enough money as an artist, so he needs to find a 'real' job. He finds an ad in a newspaper, reacts and is hired immediately. The only problem is that the offices are on the 7.5th floor and the walls are only half as high as in a normal office... During his work, he discovers a secret door behind a filing cabinet, opens it and sees a tunnel. He enters the tunnel and ends up in the head of the actor John Malkovich for about 15 minutes. He sees what the man sees and can steer his reactions, thoughts and words... After the 15 minutes he falls out of the sky, somewhere in a field outside of the city...At first I just couldn't get used to the whole concept of the movie, but after a while it felt ""normal"". I don't know how the writer ever came up with the idea, but at least you can be sure that he didn't copy it from someone else... Oh well, I really had a good time watching it and I give it an 8.5/10.

69,Chase_Witherspoon,A Malkovich mind warp,8,9 September 2012,"Cusack plays a creatively frustrated puppeteer who must take a desk job to make ends meet and subsequently discovers a secret portal into the mind's-eye of John Malkovich between two floors in the building in which he works. Though married, he becomes enamoured by the sultry co-worker (Keener) and, eager to impress her, uses the secret portal as his hook prompting the entrepreneurial vixen to devise a plan to sell experiences (ranging from the mundane - like eating breakfast - to more cultural immersions like POV of the beast with two backs) through the portal to rake a profit. Matters become complicated when both Cusack and Keener compete for the power over Malkovich's sub-consciousness, causing jealousy to emerge.It's the sort of movie you'll either appreciate or dismiss as a self-indulgent abstraction and while the concept is occasionally difficult to absorb, the plot is much easier to digest. The puppetry featured in this movie is exceptional; even if you don't possess an interest in the art, the dexterity with which the puppeteer (Phillip Huber) makes his marionette 'performers' interact is magical.Keener is a seductive and ultimately brash characterisation and should fog up your face furniture (particularly one scene with Malkovich), while Cusack plays his ubiquitous alter-ego, the intellectual man-child, consumed by neuroticism, urban paranoia, struggling to define himself amongst the masses; another watchable, if somewhat familiar portrayal. Malkovich makes a typically arrogant namesake, but as always, his enigmatic, eccentric appeal makes for a quirky, offbeat but entertaining picture unlikely to reach the masses, but a boldly interesting subject just the same for those who'd dare.",Being John Malkovich

She's bored but snaps awake when he finds a portal leading inside John Malkovich: for 15 minutes you see, hear, and feel whatever JM is doing, then you fall out by the New Jersey Turnpike.This movie is filled with originality. What the movie gives you is thought provoking and in the middle of the movie, it makes a surprising turn, offering us more twists. Yeah, this won't be a mainstream film, but really, people, go see it! Watch something different from Charlie Kaufman's twisted mind!I liked the acting by John Cusack and Catherine Keener but Cameron Diaz a lot more because she acts really different and unrecognizable from the naked eye.

72,DeeNine-2,Instant cult classic,8,18 April 2001,"(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book ""Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!"" Get it at Amazon.)This is a strikingly original film that is part science fiction, part love triangle romance, and part comedy with an undercurrent of psychological insight into human relationships, marred slightly by some familiar elements in the resolution. Charlie Kaufman, who wrote the script, and Spike Jonze who directed, are to be commend for being so daring and free with the usual notions of reality while callously demonstrating just how selfish human relationships can be. To analyze this film is very much beside the point, but I'm going to do a little bit of that anyway.John Cusack stars as an out of work puppeteer with a cheating heart. Cameron Diaz is his hard-working mousey little wife who supports him and a menagerie of animals including a chimpanzee ensconced in their New York apartment. An early scene shows her going off to work while Cusack rolls over and goes back to sleep. Catherine Keener enters the scene with her big smile and long legs as a supremely confident amoral user of people and quickly becomes the focus of the triangle as both Cusack and Diaz fall in madly in love with her. She, however, is not so enamored. She is not attracted to Cusack at all and tells him so, and finds Diaz interesting but only after seeing her adoring eyes inside the eyes of John Malkovich, who plays himself.Offbeat enough? Not yet. Cusack has met Keener through his new job as a fast-fingered file clerk at a data storage firm with offices on the seventh and a half floor in a New York high rise. The floor is just about four and a half feet high (low overhead!) so that everybody has to bend over whenever they stand up. Orson Bean plays the head of the firm who is 110 years old or so with Mary Kay Place as his annoying secretary. While filing Cusack drops a folder behind a filing cabinet. He pulls out the cabinet and lo and behold discovers a little Alice in Wonderland door. He opens it and crawls forward in the dark and swoosh! is drawn into the person of actor John Malkovich, who is going about his daily life. Cusack looks out and sees what John is seeing, hears what John is hearing, experiences what John is experiencing. He is BEING John Malkovich!Okay, we have our strikingly original premise. Where the film goes from here is the tough part. It includes some funny shtick and some intriguing ideas about identity, a prospect for immortality, Malkovich being turned into a puppet, some unusual sex games, a couple of appearances by Charlie Sheen as his contemporary self and later as a balding middle aged man, ending with the resolution of the triangle and a hint of a possible sequel. I was entertained mainly because of the strong performances by Keener, Cusack, Malkovich and Diaz. I was somewhat disappointed that the last part of the film did not live up to the beginning in terms of originality. The old people waiting for rebirth reminded me of something out of Cocoons (1985). But Cusack's prospective life as a little girl was a chuckle to contemplate, and I couldn't help but applaud Keener's sly triumph. But enough of these beguiling hints about what happens. See it for yourself.",Being John Malkovich
73,sme_no_densetsu,A fiercely original film from the mind of Charlie Kaufman,7,9 December 2008,"""Being John Malkovich"" is a difficult film to describe. In it, a puppeteer-turned-office-worker discovers a door in his office that leads into the mind of actor John Malkovich. From that launching pad, screenwriter Charlie Kaufman takes us on a ride that is nothing if not original.The cast turns out to be a pretty good one even though I'm usually not much of a fan of John Cusack or Cameron Diaz. Catherine Keener is the real standout, though, as her Oscar nomination shows. John Malkovich is also a good sport in the role he was born to play.I've mentioned the film's striking originality. This proves to be a double-edged sword. While the bizarre premise makes this a film like no other the equally bizarre romances that result are somewhat difficult to relate to. So, while it's entertaining to watch there's a certain amount of emotional detachment which, for me, knocks the film down a notch.It's worth noting that Charlie Kaufman nabbed the first of (so far) three Oscar nominations for his screenplay. Director Spike Jonze was also honored with an Oscar nomination though I don't think that I would have singled him out. The film is generally well made, though, with a mostly dreary look that suits the material but is unlikely to turn any heads.If you're looking for something truly original, this film fits the bill. It certainly won't be to everybody's taste but it's worth watching to find out if it suits yours.",Being John Malkovich
74,dunmore_ego,The Importance Of Being Malkovich,9,17 June 2006,"It's about a puppeteer who finds a portal into the head of a real-life actor No, it's about an over-sexed, 105-year-old pirate who runs a company on the 7 ½ floor of a building who has found a way to live forever No, it's about a woman who realizes she is transsexual after having sex with her lesbian lover whilst inhabiting the body of John Malkovich Okay, I give up.I plead the Charlie Kaufman defense.Like *2001: A Space Odyssey*, like *Brazil*, like *A Clockwork Orange*, *Being John Malkovich* is like nothing else in filmdom. For originality alone, it deserves the highest accolades. Like its eponymous subject matter, it is inexplicable and indefinable.Transcending its own marginally sane storyline (penned by that maniac, Charlie Kaufman), this movie stuns us with its audacity: has there ever been a puppeteer as movie hero?; when was the last time action took place on the 7 ½ floor of an office building?; have characters ever spoken plain English to a secretary, only to have her accuse them  in English  of speaking gibberish?; have we ever met such a lovable Grandpa character with such a liltingly filthy mouth (""My spunk is, to you, manna from heaven"")? And the grandest audacity of all is the plot line of the puppeteer finding a tiny hidden door in his office which turns out to be a portal into the head of John Malkovich. (Don't ask. I can't explain.) Enter the portal and for fifteen minutes you see what Malkovich sees, hear what Malkovich hears, experience what Malkovich experiences; basically a passive passenger onboard the Malkovich train  until the puppeteer finds a way to manipulate Malkovich like a human puppet Brought to the weird screen by director Spike Jonze, *Malkovich* stars John Cusack as the puppeteer, Craig Schwartz; Cameron Diaz in an actual thinking, speaking, acting role as his wife, Lotte; Catherine Keener as the glibly aloof Maxine, overplaying her arrogance as usual (I would sincerely hate to be the guy Keener comes home to every night); Orson Bean as the lovable old lech, Lester; Mary Kay Place as his befuddled secretary whose naked thighs he wants to feel next to his; and, of course, John Malkovich  or is it? Comporting himself in that slightly askew manner that can only lead us to believe he is a closet knife-killer, John Malkovich proves to be quite the sport when it comes to self-deprecation. Skewering himself as thoroughly as the movie skewers him, he does such an exemplary job of acting as if other people were inhabiting him, that we truly forget it is he himself who is calling himself an ""over-rated hack,"" or lamenting that he should have found a younger body to inhabit, for fear of breaking a hip Jonze and Kaufman bend storytelling convention so far backwards so successfully that  like *2001*, like *Brazil*, like *Orange* - we could never guess at what might be coming next in this *sui generis* tale  which is as satisfying in its own way as any left-turn plot twist.The bizarre intertwining between Maxine and Lotte and Craig-as-Malkovich will not support a simple ""Hollywood"" solution and commendably, there is no sappy ending with a heterosexual couple finally together after enduring adversity. Another portal has opened, another soul is diluted, and Carter Burwell's sad, evocative score shadows a tragic, disturbing conclusion.*Malkovich* is a balancing act between comedy and pathos: the ongoing reference to ""that jewel thief movie,"" which Malkovich is constantly accused of acting in, against his denials; the sudden cameo of a well-known Hollywood roisterer as Malkovich's confidante; a funny little backstory involving Lotte's chimp, Elijah; Cusack, as the tragic, unappreciated puppeteer, walking a line which could have easily led an audience to regard him without pity  as a ball-less, amoral cur, who had to inhabit someone else to realize his own potential  yet he somehow evokes our sympathies through his pathetic attempts at progress; there is also the unexplored allusion to sublimated personalities and possession.And what happens when Malkovich enters the portal himself? That, faithful reader, is too Malkovich for mere words to Malkovich.(Movie Maniacs, visit: poffysmoviemania.com)",Being John Malkovich
75,oneguyrambling,Proves once and for all that truly original doesn't mean merely strange.,8,3 February 2012,"Describing the plot of Being John Malkovich beyond a rough outline is a waste of time.In the case of most films the two or three paragraphs on the reverse of the DVD cover are enough to give you a fair idea of what the film is about, based upon your own tastes you should then be able to get a fair handle on whether it is for you or not.With Being John Malkovich that simply won't do. It needs to be seen before you can be sure – perhaps twice.After saying that I'll try a little: Craig Schwarz (John Cusack) is a struggling yet talented puppeteer in a world hardly crying out for them, his wife Lottie (Cameron Diaz) works in a pet store and seems to take much of her work with her to the menagerie that is their home.To pay the bills Craig applies for a filing job ('must have fast hands') on the 7 ½th floor at a company called Lestercorp where the 105 year old CEO thinks he has a speech impediment because his personal assistant can't understand what he is saying and Craig works with a cocky self confident woman named Maxine (Catherine Keener), who he becomes absolutely besotted by.It is here that Craig finds the door that leads to a portal into John Malkovich's mind behind the filing cabinet for 10 minutes before dumping you near a freeway onramp in New Joisy.Isn't it always behind the filing cabinet? By now you are rolling your eyes or thinking 'that might be the most bizarre plot I've ever heard'. You're probably right on both counts, but it is also one of the more brilliant, genre blurring and ambitious quasi mainstream films in the last century which I guess is in film history.The film is filled with abstract and just plain oddball touches – not the least of which is best describes by two words: monkey flashback – the main characters take turns lusting after each other and the non-Malkovich's are all changed by their experience inhabiting him.It all seems so right, when a concerned Malkovich looks around desperately for someone to approach for advice and seeks the consul of one Charlie Sheen playing Charlie Sheen. (Who thinks that a woman calling him Lottie during the heights of ecstasy 'hot'. Of course he does.) Both Cusack and Diaz – especially Diaz actually – have never looked less 'Movie Star' with their unkempt and unruly hairdos and *GASP* blemishes. Malkovich is obviously playing himself, and he seems to relish taking potshots at the everyday humdrum of his own everyday existence and of being constantly nearly recognised. Keener is unexpectedly sassy and bitchy, it seems she is either used to getting her way or has decided that she doesn't care what others think of her, and as always is the case those guys n gals that treat others like spam somehow manage to find themselves adored and fawned over by the very people they lord over so undeservedly.Thankfully they don't bother with the formal event scene that demands everyone (Read: Diaz) gets done up to prove that they/she really can be hot in real life.But I don't think Director Spike Jonze is even vaguely interested in doing Hollywood mainstream pleasing pap. It is far more enjoyable for him to indulge in a scene where Malkovich enters his own mind through the door and encounters a whole society of men women and – bleh – creepy children all sporting his round bald dignified visage and saying his surname in lieu of normal speech. And if that hasn't either compelled you to either look this film up or steer well clear of it then I haven't done my job at all.Final Rating – 8.5 / 10. Napoleon Dynamite and Will Ferrell have managed to turn quirkiness into profit (and undeserved millions). 'Quirk' needn't be try-hard or oddball, sometimes it is borderline genius. Being John Malkovich isn't easily digestible, but it is one of the rare films that can truly claim to be totally unique and more than a mere oddity.",Being John Malkovich

I never knew someone could come up with such a brilliant idea. Not only is the film hilarious and weird, it's also unique. It must've taken them a long time to write this movie. The end of Being John Malkovich is rather surprising. I will bring up one performance in particular. I'm bringing up Cathrine Keener's performance. If anyone knows how to play a bitch, it's Cathrine Keener. It seems like every film that she is in she plays a bitch. She plays one in this movie also. John Cusack is of course great as Craig. I also liked Cameron Diaz, the usual, as Craig's wife. Being John Malkovich has many memorable scenes. Including one scene where John Malkovich himself goes into his mind. I won't spoil that part for you. Director Spike Jonze has found a way to make a new kind of movie. Being John Malkovich is a fantastic film with a weird cast and I think it was the best movie of 1999. Not American Beauty, Being John Malkovich.The Plot: Craig is a puppeteer who gets a Job at Lester Corp. on the 7 and a half floor. While working there he falls in love with Maxine, a snotty woman who works there. He also discovers a portal that can lead you into John Malkovich's mind and you can be John Malkovich. This portal soon turns Craig's life upside down once his wife goes in.",Being John Malkovich

It's dark and depressing.  Don't watch this movie if yer in a bad mood.  Or should I say don't watch it if yer in a good mood since watching it in a bad mood might actually lighten yer day.I liked this movie nontheless but probably not watch it again simply because it's too dark for me.  Dark comedy perhaps.  Even there Swimming With Sharks easily takes first prize there.  One thing though, I sure don't feel sorry for John Cusacks character. 9 out of 10",Being John Malkovich
80,baumer,Weird and original does not make for a great film,6,14 November 1999,"This is one film that has me completely torn.  On the one hand there is so much to admire about Being John Malkovich.  The film is rich with great performances, it is directed very well by a new comer, it is a wonderfully original idea and seeing John Malcovich have the guts to portray himself, or to parody himself is quite amazing.  But on the other hand there is much to critisize about this movie.  It is slow, it doesn't really have a point and the only metaphors that I can get from the film are not clear or really that mind blowing, and the last half an hour of the film is plain and simply-----bad.  I really think that this is the type of film that cannot fail critically, critics are too afraid to tell it like it is when it comes to an ""arty"" film like this one.  It is safe and obvious to critisize a film like Armageddon or Bone Collector but admitting that you didn't really enjoy a film such as this is tricky as a critic because you may look foolish to your cronies so naturally all of them come out and tell you how wonderful and amazing and great and ya da ya da ya da this film is.  But the one thing that I noticed when I read all of the reviews before I saw the film is that not one review really told me why this film is all that they say it is, and that is because it isn't.  As I said, there is much to ""admire"" about Being John Malkovich, just not a lot to like.  But I will tell you what is good before I tell you what isn't.The performances are incredible.  John Cusack, Cameron Diaz, Katherine Keener and John Malkovich turn in stellar portrayals of who they are. Cusack is the eccentric puppeteer that can't seem to get a break in life, Diaz is his repressed wife that perhaps only a few years ago would have been not just smart but down right gorgeous.  Now she doesn't care about herself, only her animals that she cares for which includes a repressed monkey.  She goes through one of the biggest awakenings.  Keener plays Maxine, a sexy bitch that Cusack falls in lust for and then love.  She is a bit of an enigma yet she is very self assured.  And of course Malkovich plays a version of himself, perhaps a version that we, the public think he is.  All four of these performances are rich and deeply layered.  The story is also good in the sense that it is different than anything I have seen.  It is fresh and nice at times to see a movie that is different than anything you have seen before.  This is one of those movies, and I enjoyed it for that reason.  But that is where my praise ends.  That is all that I can really say is good about the film.  While the film has it's moments of comedy and of interesting observations about life ( the big one being not to live vicariously through someone else or you may lose your identity ) it just didn't keep me interested or entertained for the majority of the film and especially for the last half hour.  And for me to really enjoy a film and to think it is worth recommending to others, there has to be something to keep my interest.  This film just moves along and seems to go nowhere.  It doesn't have anything really great to say and it doesn't really take you anywhere.  As I said, sure it is different, but that does not make it good. I do have a feeling that this film is going to get a rediculous amount of mention at Oscar time, but that is not fair.  There are at least five films that I think are worthy of Oscar mention before this one, and other bound to be great films haven't even come out yet ( The Green Mile just to name one ).I think perhaps this is a film that should be seen once because maybe what I get or didn't get out of it is completely different than what someone else will.  After all there are many positive reviews in this very forum and perhaps that is saying something, but I personally don't like the film all that much and I think there are many films at the theater that are worth your time more than this one is.  If you see it, don't say you haven't been warned.  This is one film that I think the general public is wrong about and the longer it stays out, the more people will have a chance to see it and then people will realize that weird and original does make it great.  It deserves kudos for being like that but not praise.  There is a difference.",Being John Malkovich
81,mstomaso,Eraserhead for rationalists / Postmodern-Lite,8,14 March 2006,"Being John Malkovich is an odd little dark comedy which is slightly open to interpretation, but deals with themes like identity, manipulation, sex, and neuroses. The acting is excellent - but nothing less should have been expected from this cast. The screenplay is also very good, as is the direction and editing. The film moves along at a comfortable pace, relying more on the somewhat obscure messages embedded in the intriguing plot than on characters, plot-line, action, or intellect.John Cusack plays a control freak whose obsession manifests itself in his choice of an unsuccessful career - as a puppeteer. Cameron Diaz plays his wife, a passive woman with little self-determination and a very big heart. Catherine Keener plays a shallow jet-setter Cusack, and later Diaz, becomes obsessed with. John Malkovich plays John Malkovich.... sort of.One of the challenging aspects of this film is that none of these characters, with the exception of Malkovich himself, are very likable. They all do drugs, obsess on their own fantasies and have rather warped self-concepts. Of the three principals, I chose to like Diaz' character most simply because she loved animals so much.In any case, the plot is basically a bit of post-modern twilight zone sci-fi, with a somewhat more linear and conventional story line than some of the more challenging material in post-modern cinema (i.e. Eraserhead, Lost Highway, Mulholland Drive). The success of this film is probably largely due to its inherent rationality - like Memento, it feels weird and moody, but is really based on a pretty simple, if somewhat silly, concept.By entering a tiny tunnel in an office on the 7.5th floor of an office building where Cusack and keener work, you can become John Malkovich for fifteen minutes. Unless you are a puppet-master, in which case you can possess the legendary actor for the remainder of his life. To reveal any more of the plot would require a spoiler, so I will stop here. However, I want to write a little about the general themes the film comments on.*BJM points out a relationship between puppetry and acting. Though clever and cleverly portrayed, this connection is really rather superficial and pedantic.*BJM has a queer concept of morality and control. While the question of what happens to Malkovich throughout the film is hardly asked at all, the film seems to say that overtly attempting to control others is a bad thing, while doing so passively is really quite OK.*BJM definitely has a drug-induced flavor to it. I haven't smoked dope in many years, but this film is the sort of thing I used to write while high. From the amount of pot-smoking references in the film, I also got the feeling that at least the writer considered it a major part of his life.This is a really neat little surrealism-lite film. It's far from a masterpiece, but definitely worth seeing.",Being John Malkovich

The ideas are completely zany and absolutely brilliant. The acting is fabulous, the dialogue is full of classic lines that you can laugh at again and again. Oh, and the heartfelt lesbian love-story doesn't make it worse! I once loved Cameron Diaz (esp. in The Mask), but some of her later work made me revise my opinion about her in a negative direction. I will say that here, though, she performs sensitively and admirably in every way. Catherine Keener, however, gets my vote for most attractive character in this entire beautiful mess of screwy order!This is a GREAT movie, right up there with the best of the best.10 out of 10.",Being John Malkovich
84,jhclues,"Brilliant, Unique Film",10,4 July 2000,"What does it feel like to be inside someone else's skin?  Some people find out in the highly imaginative `Being John Malkovich,' directed with style by Spike Jonze, and starring John Cusack, Cameron Diaz, Catherine Keener and John Malkovich.  When out of work puppeteer Craig Schwartz (Cusack) gets a job as a file clerk on the `7 1/2' floor of an office building, it's the beginning of a bizarre interlude that will ultimately take him, and a few others as well, into a realm beyond the known.  One day he discovers a small doorway hidden behind a filing cabinet; curious, he ventures into the dark beyond and is suddenly sucked into the mind of actor John Malkovich.  After fifteen minutes of seeing through Malkovich's eyes, and experiencing what the actor is experiencing, Craig is just as suddenly and inexplicably dropped into a ditch beside the New Jersey Turnpike.  Unable to contain himself, he confides what has happened to him to Maxine (Catherine Keener), a woman who also works on 7 1/2.  Immediately, she sees money in the prospect of having a portal into the mind of John Malkovich, and she convinces Craig that they should start a business:  `J.M. Inc.'  For two hundred dollars a pop, people can have the experience of a lifetime.Jonze has taken a unique screenplay that is clever, witty, humorous and totally engrossing, and turned it into one of the most ingenious films to come our way in a long, long time.  In fact, there's never been anything quite like it.  It is distinct and filled with nuance and subtle shades of humor, sometimes dark, sometimes hilarious, but riveting throughout.  And the performances are absolutely first rate all around.  Keener deservedly got the Oscar nod for Best Supporting Actress, but Cusack, Diaz and Bean are also exemplary here.  Cusack comes through with one of the best characters he's ever done; there's an edgy, quiet intelligence to Craig, a Bohemian at heart, with a wife, Lotte (Diaz), and an apartment full of pets (snakes, birds and a chimp).  He's reserved, generally takes things as they come, and exudes a certain boyish charm when he becomes smitten with Maxine.  Diaz, taking on a decidedly unglamorous role, is terrific as Lotte, the somewhat unremarkable pet shop clerk who comes alive after experiencing the `portal.' It's a great character part, and Diaz plays it for all it's worth, connecting with the audience while ably conveying Lotte's sense of confusion and repressed yearnings.  And Orson Bean nearly steals the show as Dr. Lester, Craig's boss, the hundred-and-five year old man with a secret that holds the key to the portal.  It's a memorable performance filled with nuance and subtle humor; the scene in which he interviews job-applicant Craig is classic.  Malkovich (as himself) is the icing on the cake; he plays it straight, with a finesse and distinction that makes the unbelievable somehow credible, while lending an easy, natural flow to the innate humor of the story.  The `Malkovich, Malkovich,' sequence, and his rendition of the puppet's dance are unforgettable scenes.The supporting cast includes Mary Kay Place (Floris), Charlie Sheen (Charlie), Carlos Jacott (Larry), Willie Garson (Guy in restaurant) and Byrne Piven (Captain Mertin).  Written by Charlie kaufman, `Being John Malkovich' is a movie that is an experience in itself.  And Jonze and his entire cast should be given a standing ovation for bringing this one to life, for making it breathe.  It's the kind of film you wait for to come along, but rarely does, and it demands to be seen more than once.  Like Lotte, once you've been through the portal, you have to do it again; once you've tasted the nectar, there's no turning back.   10/10.",Being John Malkovich

Now if the film was called"" Being Bradd Pitt"" or ""Being Madonna"" in other words more interesting people this might have been better. There are some good parts of the film,the first half hour for instance when he first goes to his place of work , the seventh and half floor, it has you gripped and is funny in part but ,like the portal in craig's office it goes down hill from there. 6 out of 10.",Being John Malkovich

87,Bob-45,"Neither Fiche nor Foul (Well, maybe a little)",7,21 February 2000,"BEING JOHN MALKOVICH opens brilliantly, an unbelievably beautiful demonstration of puppeteering, which introduces us to Craig Schwartz (John Cusak), a tormented artist, far more capable of communicating his passions and angst via his puppets than directly to his wife Lotte (Cameron Diaz). Not too surprising, since Lotte is a fairly gross and dirty human being, who kisses and shares her beverages with her chimpanzee. In fact, the most unbelievable line in the movie is Lotte asking Craig to let her ""take a shower."") Lotte doesn't strike me a person whom would ever want one.  Perhaps due to this, Craig becomes immediately smitten when he meets Maxine (Christine Keener), a slightly slutty, fairly attractive gold digger, when he answers an ad for a ""man with fast hands to do filing"" at Dr. Lester's (Orson Bean).  What Dr. Lester does is not all that clear, but the business apparently involves handling files for other companies. Interesting, because the offices are tiny, and not just because the place has ""low overhead,"" being the 7 1/2 floor.  Anyway, while filing, Craig discovers an opening behind one of the cabinets.  Entering it, he discovers a portal into actor John Malcovich's psche.  Up to this point the movie is a brilliant existentialist comedy (the best since BRAZIL).  However, about two thirds of the way through the film, too much information is revealed, turning the film into fantasy/sci fi. Sorry, this movie doesn't have the budget for it.  It makes an old OUTER LIMITS episode look like STAR WARS EPISODE 1 by comparison.  It also calls into question everything which has proceeded.  Fantasy/sci fi must be grounded in some form of plausibility.  Companies which keep files either have huge climate controlled storage, use disks or, at least microfiche. Dirty or not, Diaz is still too desirable to make Craig's obsession with Maxine (Catherine Keener) all that convincing. Diaz is good in the part, but her casting throws the film way off.  Either the producers should have cast Ellen DeGeneres in the part, or have cast Michelle Pfieffer as Maxine.Ultimately, BEING JOHN MALKOVICH is a fairly amusing disappointment, much better in concept than execution.",Being John Malkovich

Many reviewers have in essence interpreted this film as what it is like to have ones' 15 minutes of fame; I view this film as examining with great hum-our the concept of ""being""-played for and with maximum laughs.

Being John Malkovich truly is one of the most inventive, mind-boggling and subversively profound movies I have ever had the pleasure of experiencing...and experiencing, and experiencing - I've seen it more than once and it always comes across as fresh and I always marvel at it anew each time.

91,jpschapira,That crazy old Charlie,8,13 March 2009,"It is very possible that cinema will never be able to find a writer like Charlie Kaufman again, and if it does, it will be someone too similar to him. Kaufman knows no limits, knows no endings (believe me, his scripts would never end if he could take that decision) and thinks, as a screenwriter, in creating material that at the end of the day is purely cinematographic. Luckily, he's always found apt directors to bring his words to life: Michel Gondry and Spike Jonze (sorry, George Clooney doesn't count because Kaufman's script for the actor/director's first film is adapted).In ""Being John Malkovich"", Kaufman's imagination takes flight and images go right along flying with it. It's not the writer's intention to arouse questions of philosophical, even metaphysical nature. There's a scene in which Craig (John Cusack), the film's main character, explains Maxine (Catherine Keener) about a portal he found that leads him to John Malkovich's head. He tells her he went into the portal with a piece of wood and came back without it and, because he's strangely in love with her, he tries to impress her by making a speech about how this may change his life.It is in that speech that Craig asks, one after another, philosophical questions that are a clear joke; fact that's evidently seen because Maxine is laughing at him. The poor guy, a puppeteer, hasn't been able to impress her and goes back home to make a puppet of himself and Maxine; only to recreate an impossible sexual encounter. At home Craig's awaited by his wife Lotte (Cameron Diaz), some kind of veterinarian or pet lover who keeps a dog, a parrot, a chimp and who knows what else inside the house.Character development is perfect. Maxine is cold, disinterested, unimpressed and at the same time mysterious; an office femme fatale that Keener portrays perfectly. Craig is an insecure, depraved, depressive, almost sick artist; and his wife is very much like him (each Cusack and Diaz probably deliver their best performances). What Kaufman does is develop a classic, tragic love triangle an puts John Malkovich in the middle, as a the connection between the three players, a vehicle for the realization of their passions.It could have been any other person, but the fact that the actor is famous works as a plot device for something crucial, and that is people paying to be John Malkovich for fifteen minutes. So there's no philosophical meditation in ""Being John Malkovich"", just a gifted screenwriter messing with himself and automatically messing with our minds too. This means, of course, that there's a moment where everything kind of goes to hell; but we're able to accept it.If you would care to look for a subject though, it would be more 'psychological'. There's a lot in the film that Kaufman later took to each one of his scripts, things that mentioned separately are scarier than the amusing visual rides directors make us experience: sexual obsession, childhood memories and some other things that are hidden in the subconscious. It's delirious, but in one scene we even see a close up of a chimp that a second later is remembering the most tragic experience of his childhood.",Being John Malkovich
92,Atreyu_II,Wow! What is this mess?,2,20 October 2010,"I'm gonna be very, very frank: I hated this movie. I don't get all the praise towards it. It's an original film, but one of those which the difference doesn't bring good results. I didn't like it the slighest bit. In fact, there wasn't a single moment I liked. It was incredibly dull and dumb.Lots of things don't fit well (if anything fits well in it at all). For example, what was that goofyness of the ceilings being SO lowheight in that job, forcing its workers to duck the whole time? Another thing I noticed on that job was that the woman who interviewed Craig misunderstood every little thing he said and even claimed a few times that she didn't know what he was talking about. It also doesn't make sense that Dr. Lester kept insisting that he talked poorly, that people had a hard time to understand what he says - when he speaks perfectly well. Plus, he said he was 105 years old. I don't believe it! Yes, he was an old man, but he couldn't possibly be that old! Not even close to that!None of the characters were minimally captivating or interesting. Craig himself seemed to become something like a nutcase through the film's course. Besides, that ridiculous and alarming obsession of people in wanting to be John Malkovich... including Lotte (Craig's wife), who even wanted to go as far as becoming a transsexual (give me a break!!!) - even if she didn't get to do it.Everything in this joke of a movie was insane and ridiculous. The fact that the other woman manipulates Malkovich to make love with Craig and Lotte when they were inside him (and the way he was controlled by Craig). The fact that in the end Malkovich gets rid of all that mess only to be possessed again by numerous people who completely dominate him - and the portal is never destroyed! Malkovich even goes inside himself to one point. And what he sees is hundreds of Malkovichs! They're everywhere! Constantly hearing John Malkovich's name bored me to death. I got pretty tired of listening to his name all the time. Plus, why is this movie about being John Malkovich and not someone more interesting? For example, like George Clooney? The entire scenario looks awful and so lifeless. As for Cameron Diaz, if I didn't already know she was in the film I probably wouldn't recognize her. It was quite a shock to see the beautiful Cameron Diaz (the gorgeous and super sexy Tina Carlyle from 'The Mask' - a movie that I like very much) like this: really ugly, the combination of that awful freezy hair with that awful color and those more than horrible clothes. All of this made her look almost like a witch. The character she portrayed wasn't likable either. Plus, her performance was very poor (just like everyone else in the film).Everyone in the film thinks that Malkovich was in a jewel thief movie. As far as I know, he was never in a jewel thief movie before this. Ironically, he was in 'Johnny English' (2003), which is a jewel thief movie - and his character, Pascal Sauvage, was involved in it until his neck.In conclusion, this was one of the worst movies I have ever seen.",Being John Malkovich

Some people say it's a just shameful auto-promotion by John Malkovich, but who cares?! If it's so, just let it be, because I don't care if the title is ""Being John Malkovich"" or ""Being Cameron Diaz"" or even ""Being the Pope"" (!); what really matters here is the movie's concept, its original idea and its message to the viewer! And about that I must say you something: it's really fantastic, one of the best movies I've seen latterly by Hollywood! The plot is original, fresh, and really different from what I've seen so far. At the beginning I just felt oddness, because the story was completely senseless, out of any possible and reasonable logic, and to increase even more this feeling of strangeness it had an alternative kind of humor, which passed too many times from the hilarity to the absurdity. But it was great either! (I can remember that scene when Lotte, Cameron Diaz's character says: ""I think it's kind of sexy that John Malkovich has a portal, you know, it's sort like he has a vagina! It's sort of vaginal, like he has a penis and a vagina!"" LOL! That's crazy stuff, man!). But if the first part of the movie is completely strange and out of any logic, the second part start giving us some answers, a bit crazy too, but at least with a little logic The performances of the four main actors are great too: John Cusack, Cameron Diaz, Catherine keener and John Malkovich did excellent acting.This film was really refreshing and innovative.

Craig discovers a hole in the wall of his office which turns out to be a portal into the mind of actor John Malkovich, which allows those who enter to view the world from Malkovich's mind for 15 minutes, at which time they are then deposited at the side of the road on the New Jersey Turnpike. To reveal anymore of the story would be wrong for the uninitiated, but suffice it to say that director Spike Jonz has mounted a quirky and unpredictable roller coaster ride which keeps the viewer constantly guessing and consistently entertained. Cusack receives solid support from Catherine Keener, smart and vivacious in her Oscar-nominated turn as Maxine, Craig's partner-in-crime with whom he falls in love, Cameron Diaz as Craig's dizzy wife, Lottie, and, of course,Malkovich himself, who deserves major kudos for allowing us to laugh along with him, at himself and his image.

I didn't like the direction and although Charlie Kaufman's screenplay had a lot of potential, I didn't like the outcome of this film. not a good movie, boring, decent acting, cusack was great, keener was good too, but film was too boring and pointless, sucked!

98,Movie-12,"One of the most unique, imaginative movies ever made. **** out of ****",9,28 November 1999,"BEING JOHN MALKOVICH (1999) ****Starring: John Cusack, Cameron Diaz, Orson Bean, Catherine Keener, John Malkovich, and Charlie Sheen Director: Spike Jonze   Running Time: 113 minutes   Rated R (for sexuality and language)By Blake French:It is not every day that I use words in my movie reviews such as unique, creative, inventive, imaginative, original, fresh, mesmerizing, and unmatched. Under the circumstances of ""Being John Malkovich,"" a wonderfully hilarious presentation of an incomprehensible idea, I find myself using every one of those phrases and then some more being deserved. Everything about it is labyrinthine, intriguing, and very funny. It is one of the years best films, and should be well presented come Academy Award time.
""Being John Malkovich"" details the relationship between Craig and Lotte Schwartz. They basically live an old fashioned life in a small apartment with a miniature zoo of pets and a puppet factory inside. Lotte is a typical, unattractive homemaker while Craig holds that unusual occupation of being a professional puppeteer. Desperately searching for employment, Craig soon visits a business for an interview as a filer when he discovers for some odd reason the construction of the office floor is all but several feet tall, forcing all employees to bend over backwards just to walk around.
One of those employees is named Maxine, a highly seductive co-worker of Craig's. When he asks her out for a beer one night, Craig experiences lustful thoughts about her, and nearly begins an affair as his seemingly loving wife wonders around her happy little apartment all by herself.
As you can see, the household isn't exactly a joyful situation. All things change, from blossoming sexual confusion to inner self-esteem, when Craig uncovers a small door behind a filing cabinet in his office. It is tucked away, hidden acutely well in a dark corner, which is found mysteriously by accident when Craig droops a paper behind the cabinet. After Craig explores this deep miniature, seemingly endless hallway, he discovers this secret door leads to the brain of actor John Malkovich for fifteen minutes, then spits you out along the roadside afterwards.Wow, sounds like ""Alice in Wonderland,"" doesn't it...well, sort of.  Craig first tells his co-worker about his discovery, who continues to think he's nuts. Then, after explaining and showing this portal to his wife, who is hysterical, Maxine begins to believe Craig, and concoct a devilish idea. To sell tickets allowing a pedestrian to enter the mind of a famous celebrity. The tagline: Ever wanted to be someone else? Now you can.It is very intriguing how the narrative point of view is juggled between Craig and then Lotte after the problem is introduced and then solved: the couples dead-end lives are lifted in glory. This creates a second conflict moving us smoothly into the second act. Perfect internal problems are created with the two female leads; Lotte and Maxine find themselves physically attracted to each other in unbelievable character twists. The two end up having a femininity sexual relationship while one is entrapped in the mind of Malkovich, and the other experiences the actual Malkovich. It is a beautifully crafted structure, with act breaks so clear and complications so faultless it is no wonder while this is such an effective picture.
Also first rate here are the performances. Although the film offers strange types of roles for these actors to indulge themselves in, they do a wonderfully energetic job. Cameron Diaz is flawlessly cast as Craig's sexually and mentally uncoordinated wife, and delivers us a comically riotous character. John Cusack as Craig himself is superior and believable as a down on his luck puppeteer, and possesses a perfect blend of humor and unpredictable qualities with his character. Also quite good here, John Malkovich, who has much more of a difficult role than one would think. He has some hard scenes where Craig controls him while inside his mind, which requires great skill to perform.However, better than any performance, and more amazing then any flawless characters or plot, is the concept of a human being thinking up such an absurd idea as the imagination behind the beauty of ""Being John Malkovich."" With such a penetrating, magical atmosphere to it, it is kind of a shame that the filmmakers created this film in the form of a black comedy instead of something more harrowing. Although comedy is simply the most logical choice to categorize this type of film, wouldn't it have been interesting to see this movie as a drama, or perhaps as a spiritual awakening picture.
Regardless, the film still has an oddly powerful message to it, which I will not, nor do I ever directly reveal in any of my reviews. You see, since different individuals come from different backgrounds, and thus see things differently. It is because of this that I do not allow my personal take on a message persuade another filmgoer whose idea of a moral may be much different than my own. But I will say that ""Being John Malkovich"" might not overtake the box office, but for appreciative movie patrons, this one is sure to be treasured for a long time to come.Brought to you by Gramercy Pictures.",Being John Malkovich
99,alice liddell,'Shall we to the boudoir' cracks me up every time - two-thirds masterpiece (possible spoiler),8,5 April 2000,"To call this film 'Bunuellian' is to flatter its political engagement, because this is literally the product of a culture that has turned in on itself (to speak politely), but you can see the point: Craig is a heterosexual monster with 'artistic' (bourgeois?) trimmings, whose hairy slovenliness signifies the retreat into bestiality of his zoo/home, where he locks his wife in a cage, and 'rapes' his/her loved one by pretending to be someone else (twice over). This is dangerous, dark stuff, and the film's punishment of Craig - he is forever trapped in the body of a child, doomed to watch the happiness of the two women in his life - lets us off the hook in a way Bunuel never would, and it might seem a bit hard to take a happy ending celebrating a world where men aren't necessary from two (very successful) men; but the film is terrific fun, civilised in its mind-bending misanthropy/optimism, even if, if I may say so under IMDb guidelines, it kind of loses it in the last third,",Being John Malkovich
100,FlickJunkie-2,Clever and imaginative film,8,10 May 2000,"This is a clever and imaginative story with a lot of droll and peculiar situations that make for an entertaining film.  John Cusack plays Craig Schwartz, a frustrated puppeteer who can't find work.  He takes a job as a file clerk and discovers a portal that leads inside John Malkovich's head that allows him to see and experience what Malkovich is doing for 15 minutes until it spits him out on the New Jersey Turnpike.  The remainder of the film uses this device to create absurd uses for the portal, from selling tickets to Malkovich to two women having sex using Malkovich's body.Ultimately, the puppeteer discovers how to take over Malkovich and he proceeds to usurp Malkovich's life.  In one particularly ingenious scene, Schwartz is manipulating Malkovich to be a puppeteer who has a marionette manipulating yet another smaller marionette.  It's a little like Russian matroishka dolls where every time you open one, there is another smaller one inside.  If you take it one step further, it was really Maxine who was the master puppeteer, manipulating Schwartz to manipulate Malkovich.This film goes beyond humor of the absurd to humor of the bizarre.  At times it gets a bit too far out to be funny (like when Malkovich goes inside Malkovich and sees Malkovich's everywhere).  But the material is fresh and innovative and most of the skits work well, silly as they sometimes are.Spike Jonze is a strange guy with a strange sense of humor which is perfect for this film.  If you get the DVD, one of the bonus features is an interview with Jonze.  If you see this interview, you will get a fuller understanding of just how strange he can be.  He does some very interesting things with the camera, lighting and setup that give the film a very distinctive look.  This was Jonze first feature film.  Clearly his work in music videos, where directors are a lot freer to push the creative envelope, helped in the making of this film.  I thought he could have done a better job with the Malkovich perspective (it looked like you were looking backwards through a pair of binoculars), but most of the camera work was quite good.  I particularly liked the way he split the sound tracks to have Malkovich's voice come out of the back speakers while in his perspective.The acting in this film was terrific.  John Malkovich, who excels in both dramatic and comedic roles did a fabulous job of playing himself, poking fun at himself at every turn.  Poor John Cusack.  He is such a tall guy and they made him play half his part on a set with 4 ½ foot ceilings.  He was very funny as the tortured puppeteer.  Catherine Keener was a scream as the bitchy and evil Maxine.Overall, this film is a rollicking good time.  I rated it 8/10.  It is funny throughout but sometimes goes a little too far off the deep end.  If you like absurd humor, you will love this film.",Being John Malkovich
101,redkiwi,Now that's what I call a film!,9,2 April 2000,"This is more like it, a film that actually surprises you all the way through with some brilliant writing and superb acting performances from Cusack, Diaz and Malkovich himself.Just the whole concept is weird enough to make you take a completely different slant on the film, right down to the portal to John's mind being itself on the 7 and a halfth floor of a building.Excellent script, brilliant acting and a fantastically weird idea makes this one of the best films I have seen in a long time.",Being John Malkovich
102,Bogmeister,More than we need to know?,8,23 July 2005,"A frustrated puppeteer gets a new job in a building with a '7-1/2' floor, where the ceilings are too low and everyone has to stoop down. He finds a hidden entry hole in the wall and, crawling in, finds himself sucked into the head of actor John Malkovich (playing himself), feeling & hearing everything the actor does. After 15 minutes, the puppeteer is suddenly spat out on the side of a New Jersey road. You would think it can't get any weirder than that, but the story actually comes up with a plot to explain why all this is happening (which may or may not be good - I sorta liked the mystery behind this odd stuff). Soon, the puppeteer (Cusack), his strange wife, and a cold fish co-worker (Keener) hatch a plan to charge people $200 a pop for spending 15 minutes inside Malkovich's head (it always comes back to plain old capitalism, don't it?). The story progresses on for further twists until it reaches the stature of an odd mini-epic, despite obviously BEING low-budget (the lighting, in particular, stinks in places, tho this may be on purpose). I can understand why this almost won the Best Screenplay Oscar: the makers took the potential of the premise as far as it can go, but most 'mainstream' viewers, as I've read elsewhere, will find this baffling: What is the point? What is it really all about? Well, it may be worth the rental just to watch Malkovich hamming it up as a sideways version of himself, tripping on the twilight-zone-like nature of the story and reinventing himself for the camera. But, I also see visions of writers holed up for a week, writing non-stop, taking the story in directions based on frantic brainstorming. That's not bad, but did we really need to know any of this, this result?",Being John Malkovich
103,movieguy1021,Being John Malkovich: 6/10,6,12 January 2003,"In Spike Jonze's overrated but fine movie Being John Malkovich, John Cusack is Craig Schwartz, a struggling puppeteer. He lives with his wife Lotte (Cameron Diaz), who is an animal lover, but we never find out her job. Craig needs a job so he gets a job on the 7½ floor of an office building. Soon he discovers a portal into the head of actor John Malkovich (John Malkovich). Weirdness ensues.Cusack is unrecognizable, and so is Diaz, but not Catherine Keener, who plays Maxine, someone else who works on the 7½ floor. I found that the quasi-romantic quality between Cusack and Keener was one-sided. Keener's acting was rather stiff; I was disappointed. Cusack was quite good, if a little forced at times; it seems like he was forced into doing this movie. Diaz was okay, but nothing remarkable. As I said before, Keener's acting was flat. Malkovich actually was good, I was pleasantly surprised.The story is unusually mellow, going for a lot of the movie without music. It would make more sense to bring out the mood of the piece. I also felt like Jonze underplayed the fantasy element. Sure, I liked the 7½ floor and the portal, but if they had used more special effects (imagine a day where someone would say that) it would have been more believable, not that this concept is one that happens every day. The ending, which includes Craig's boss Dr. Lester (Orson Bean), seemed too out there and out of the blue. Many times, we were expected to think `Oh, of course!' because they rarely explained anything. I did find it amusing at first, but after awhile it got annoying.At the beginning there were lots of laughs, but they soon became sporadic and smaller. Of course, this isn't a film where everyone is telling one-liners, but if they had, as I've said before, put in special effects, maybe humorous ones, it would have made the movie more enjoyable. It was very entertaining and imaginative, though. Only Jonze could think of something this twisted. I had no idea where this roller coaster was going to stop or if I'd just be stuck in the loop-the-loop for 105 minutes.To me, it looks like Jonze is a puppet fan, glamorizing puppets all throughout the movie. I didn't like the `first ending', where everything slows down, but the last one I did like a lot. That doesn't make any sense, right? Well, where you think the conclusion is I didn't like, but the denouement I enjoyed. There's not much more I can say about this flawed but enjoyable comedy.My rating: 6/10Rated R for language and sexuality.",Being John Malkovich
104,WriterDave,One of a Kind,9,4 March 2003,"This is quite possible the most blissfully unique and weird film ever made this side of the Atlantic ocean. Even if this head trip ultimately leaves you confused and bewildered how can you not have been entertained by a movie where the main character is a neurotic puppeteer, people work at an office on the 7th 1/2 floor (the ceilings and overhead are really low!), people who travel through John Malcovich's head are unceremoniously dropped on the side of the New Jersey turnpike, we meet a chimp with post traumatic stress disorder, and a woman with a PhD in psycholinguistics who can't understand a word anybody says? This film also gets kudos for the most creative use of a quasi-lesbian subplot ever conceived for film. And don't worry, this isn't just weird for weirdness' sake (and neither is the other Jones/Kaufman collaboration, ""Adaptation"" a far more serious look at the horrors of imagination, the creative process, and the Hollywood studio system).

107,oOoBarracuda,Being John Malkovich,5,1 March 2017,"I wanted to be a philosophy major in college, but I also wanted to be gainfully employed so I abandoned that wish. Philosophy has remained a way of which I spend my time. A film, philosophical in its premise, will always be one that I gravitate towards. Being John Malkovich, the 1999 film by Spike Jonze is a film purely philosophical in its plot and approach. The film stars John Cusack as a man who makes a living as a puppeteer, desperate to control an aspect of his otherwise meaningless existence. When he finds a portal which allows people to enter into the head of actor John Malkovich, he attempts to make a profit with his business affiliate played by Catherine Keener. When both his business affiliate and wife played by Cameron Diaz fall in love with the actor, he has lost even more control of his life and may go to extreme measures to gain control.Craig Schwartz (John Cusack) is a struggling puppeteer who builds his own puppets and is desperate to make a living doing the work he is impassioned with, lives a life that is filled with mundane activities. When his wife and animal lover Lottie, who herself owns a pet store, encourages him to finally get a job, Craig finds himself at a company called LesterCorp, located on the seventh and a half floor with ceilings so low one can't fully extend their body to an upright position to work as a file clerk. Something seems off about this building and its personnel immediately, before Craig can even learn the half of it (I'm punny). While attempting to settle into his new work environment one day, Craig stumbles upon a small door in his office that leads him into the head of actor John Malkovich. Craig and his co-worker Maxine Lund (Catherine Keener) decide to sell 15-minute increments of time in John Malkovich's head as an experience to the public. At first, the revelation makes Craig feel as though he has some control and purpose over his life and the lives of others. Soon, however, his co-worker and crush Maxine begins to fall in love with the actor, then, Craig's wife falls in love with him as well after her 15-minute ride in the mind of John Malkovich. His newfound control and purpose begin to spiral out of control leaving Craig desperate to find a way to gain it back, despite what that means to anyone involved.The idea of self is heavily explored throughout Being John Malkovich. Malkovich's ""self"" is intruded upon and under constant threat, which is a cardinal worry of many social philosophers. What does free will enter and how can one maintain their grasp on their free will when it is constantly under siege from so many intruders around us. Human isolation is also clearly illustrated throughout Being John Malkovich. Each of Craig's puppets is separated by a wall or some other object, and each of the people we meet in Craig's life doesn't spend too much time surrounded by others. Even the communal experience of gaining entry to John Malkovich's head further isolates people once their time as him ends. Each person that comes out of John Malkovich leaves appreciating his life more and their life less further calling to question issues of self. Perhaps the most overarching issue examined in Jonze's film is the question of the existence of a soul. What is beyond life and self and breaches the metaphysics, is anything. Each person seems more apt to explore the being of John Malkovich than actually explore their own identities. Perhaps there is nothing to the idea of soul to the filmmaker; either way, the existence of soul, the examination of self, and human isolation are extreme areas of interest to the plot and background of Being John Malkovich.",Being John Malkovich
108,SquigglyCrunch,"Original, Funny, and Really, Really Weird",9,10 December 2015,"I don't know what I expected with this movie, but it certainly wasn't THAT. Nevertheless, it was a lot of fun to watch. Being John Malkovich is weird. Not just your average weird, with loud noises and the such, or weird to the point of not making any sense. It makes sense for the most part, but it still manages to be extremely confusing. Why is it confusing? Because I wonder what Spike Jonze was thinking when he made this, or even how he had the idea. The idea is really original, but what Jonze decided to do with it was just odd. Why, of all things, would you make it about that? Now I'm not complaining, it actually turned out pretty stinking funny, but it just makes you wonder how this idea popped into Jonze's head and who looked at this and thought ""Sounds like a good idea. Let's make a movie out of it"". I wonder how John Malkovich himself felt about it too. Overall Being John Malkovich is just weird. I really don't know what else I could say, and I feel like just an average review would make this movie out to be average when it's anything but. This movie is original, funny, interesting, weird, and just about anything else you wouldn't expect. It's a movie that, although didn't always make sense, wasn't made to be analyzed.

109,garethcrook,"Malkovich Malkovich, sing it with me...",9,15 July 2020,"I loved this when it came out. I used to quote lines from it all the time, which I'm sure was quite annoying. It's wonderfully offbeat, a bit nuts, an absurd fantasy. Directed by Spike Jonze and written by Charlie Kaufman, that's not that unusual. You've got to embrace its quirks. Craig (John Cusack) is a lonely, socially inept puppeteer. He's married to Lotte (Cameron Diaz) who suggests he gets out of the house. The puppeteering isn't going so well you see, he's let's say, unconventional with his themes. Getting out of the house isn't a bad idea, seeing as they share it with a wide range of pets include dogs, parrots, an iguana, a chimp. Craig finds a job filing at Lester Corp, in the Mertin Flemmer Building. Lester Corp is situated on the 7 and a half floor with ""low overheads, we pass the savings on to you"". To get there you have to emergency stop the lift between floors and jimmy the doors with a crowbar in the corner. As soon as Craig steps off the lift, walking down the corridor with everyone hunched over in the 4ft office space I'm hooked all over again. There's the receptionist that mishears everything. The 105 year old boss who thinks he's got a speech impediment and likes to share his sexual fantasies and of course the orientation film! A brilliant sequence that introduces us to the history of the 7 and a half floor. It's here that Craig first meets Maxine (Catherine Keener) who Craig takes an instant shine to despite her palpable disinterest in him. Craig's just too awkward, only through his puppets is he able to find the confidence he craves. Getting into their heads, finding a sense of control. Then one fateful day, a file falls behind a cabinet at work. He moves the cabinet away from the wall to get it and discovers a tiny door with a cut glass handle. Opening it, he finds a tunnel and an ominous draft. As he crawls in he gets pulled through a portal into the head of John Malkovich. Brilliant! He's a passenger, seeing the world through Malkovich's eyes, before getting spat out covered in gunk at the side of the New Jersey Turnpike. This of course makes Craig interesting to Maxine, who spots a business opportunity. Selling tickets to Malkovich, but for Craig it poses many existential questions. Of course, we're wondering 'what the hell is going on?', but like I say, go with it. Lotte and Craig are invited to dinner at Dr Lester's (Orson Bean) and Lotte discovers another door with a cut glass handle. This one isn't tiny, but does reveal a room filled with framed photos of Malkovich throughout his life. There must be a link, but back to that later. Lotte becomes obsessed after trying the portal, with Malkovich, with the power. Maxine too, but then that's less surprising from Maxine. She doesn't go into Malkovich, her interests are in making easy money. Maxine's also interested in Lotte, much to Craig's annoyance, but only when she's in Malkovich, who she's now dating, slightly to Lotte's annoyance. A bizarre love triangle or possibly quadrangle that cracks Craig. Until he figures out how to control Malkovich, another puppet in his collection. This obviously freaks Malkovich, who confides in Charlie Sheen, because, well because this is the 90s. He follows Maxine to the Mertin Flemmer building behind a queue of eager punters, barges his way in and heads down the portal. Cue a truly glorious 2 minute sequence where everything is 'MALKOVICH'. He's not happy about it obviously and the whole enterprise is in jeopardy, but then it's in danger of imploding anyway. Craig controls Malkovich, Maxine controls Craig. Lotte spurned tells Dr Lester who's not Dr Lester and the whole thing falls into place. Honestly it makes perfect sense when you're watching it. Craig gets his way. For a time. He's now Malkovich. He's destined for disappointment though. Destined to be absorbed. There's a reason Dr Lester has all those photos of Malkovich. A disturbing sequence through Malkovich's subconscious, heralds the end of this masterpiece, but it's a beautiful bonkers and twisty ride. It's charming, funny, inventive, utterly unique and I love it!",Being John Malkovich
110,ronakkotian,One of a kind,10,8 July 2020,"I've been wanting to see Charlie Kaufman's work for a long time. He's a screenwriter that I've heard so much about so I decided to watch the first ever screenplay he's written. I have to say there is no film like Being John Malkovich.Being John Malkovich tells the story of a failed puppeteer that gets a job in an office. One day, in his work area, he finds a portal which leads directly into John Malkovich's head.I don't want to give out any more details as I want people to watch it immediately and recognise the talent and creativity of Charlie Kaufman. This is his FIRST screenplay and it's amazing how he came up with such a unique and surreal idea. I'm surprised it even got made. Surely producers were reluctant to give money at a project that's as wacky as Being John Malkovich.What surprises me the most is how well executed it is. This was Spike Jonze's directorial debut and he did such a good job. He did it so well that he actually got a Best Director nomination for it. That's very impressive especially considering how it's his first film. The main credit goes to Charlie Kaufman without a doubt. This film conveys his creativity and uniqueness which sets him apart from other screenwriters. It's not just the uniqueness that make this film good but also the deeper meaning it presents to the audience. Through its weird and crazy story, Kaufman explores many themes such as the desire to become someone else, love, consciousness and identity allowing Being John Malkovich to stay etched into your mind.The performances are absolutely brilliant. This is the best I've seen John Cusack and I hope to see him in more unorthodox films like this. Cameron Diaz is almost unrecognisable here and she was terrific. Catherine Keener won the Oscar for her work in this and I cannot deny how good she was here. It must have been very strange for John Malkovich to do this film but he shines in every scene he's in.Being John Malkovich is a one of a kind film.

Simple on paper it may seem but the entire transformation and revelations begin then.... He learns that his wife is transsexual...his colleague whom he wanted to make love with actually wants to sleep with john malkovich with his wife in his head. He is lost totally...he then cages his wife and goes into Malkovich head and makes love with his colleague...and yes the puppeteer comes now...he realizes that he could control his actions and does so...yes by touching her colleague's left boob at will.....but having said all this........there are more surprises left....What if Malkovich himself entered the head of Malkovich? That is sorted out.....EVERYTHING BECOMES MALKOVICH.....everything seen and heard is just Malkovich.....wow......a crazy idea and yes it is right to an extent...whenever I thought too much about my own self I could see myself doing something (it was an illusion) but this aspect is really thrilling to know and may also make one go crazy....anyways back to plot......It is now.......Craig wants to Stay in Malkovich forever and does so...he makes Malkovich a success full puppeteer.....and earns money.....lives the life of a millionaire kind.....now his colleague is pregnant rightly so as they have been making love but wait...again a surprise...OK now a bit or retrospection and inquisitive, engrossed too much into the thing that what would happen next, I almost lost that why was there a portal....only for malkovich or why basically there is a way into his head.......its learnt later and its related to construction of 71/2 floor (that's a hint)....It's a clear movie..it seems to solve the answers that it has raised itself......and yet it still ends ask many more psychological questions......what would it be if we are in another soul feels it feels, see what it sees, hear what it hears....man this is a crazy thing......but an experience to experiment with.Having almost revealed the entire story or plot, the acting is top notch and realistic even in this highly fictitious drama... John Cusack as Craig just excels ....he must have practiced pup petering a lot for this...and so did John Malkovich....Cameron Diaz lives as if she has been living with her pets, the chimpanzee, a dog, a bird for ages....there are other animals...like a chameleon too....and the witch (don't know its a right thing to say) played by Catherine Keener is just right...and even the other actors perform aptlyAll said and above, Kudos to writer Charlie Kaufman for writing such a thing and for Spike Jonze for accepting to make it and making it so engagingly.......It's a must take ride....

It shares the same insane sense of humor and presents us with a world which is very similar to the one created in Brazil. Great performances by John Cusack, John Malkovich, and Cameron Diaz, but can't be fully appreciated because the material that they work with is the show stealer. This is a movie that could have gone over the 200 minute mark and probably still would have been interesting. It's dark ending is a bit scary and you can't help but feel a bit of sympathy for poor Malkovich who gets but a few fleeting seconds of freedom before becoming a prisoner to the greedy old bastard and his collegues.

113,andrewroy-04316,"Undeniably creative, though thematically dense and jumbled",6,23 August 2020,"Being John Malkovich certainly deserves its reputation as one of the more bizarre, ambitious, and original premises out there, and I appreciate that Jonze and Kaufman fully committed to it. This is a film that is really difficult for me to collect my thoughts on, as it's difficult for me to parse what does and does not make sense among the absurdity. I like all of the performances, and I love the premise. Kaufman's screenplay is solid, with several very funny moments that highlight character quirks nicely in the first act. I actually didn't love Jonze's direction - thematically, I found it very jumbled and thought some editing of scenes did not flow smoothly. There were also small touches that felt like a lack of attention to detail or cutting corners, such as it being night outside when the characters say it's 4 PM, or the bizarre acceptance of everyone that such a portal is not only plausible but that the word gets out so quickly as to have customers all day (and who knows how they figured out how to get to floor 7.5 on their own). The true heart of the film, however, rests on the idea of inhabiting someone else's body, and how that changes a person. The notion of an increase in empathy and self-understanding after such an experience is touched on early by Lotte, and only caring about someone for their external appearance is one of the most important themes I took away from the film. I love the idea of immortality through vessels, though both the explanation of how it came about and the way it works for those old people should have been clearer (also, you're telling me someone wrote a book on this top secret vessel process?). While I appreciate that the characters are well defined and unique, they were also by far my biggest problem with Kaufman's screenplay. Craig's absolute obsession with Maxine from the moment he saw her, despite being married and her treating him terribly, was ridiculous. Maxine's disinterest in Craig and Lotte in themselves but loving them within Malkovich is a very interesting idea, but they should've explored the root of that, which unfortunately never happened. Lotte and Craig's relationship is very strange and doesn't seem to make any sense for either of them. There's a lot to appreciate about the film, and I do think you could make a wide range of arguments for different thematic points the film could be making in the third act. That can be good as I do like some ambiguity, but also am frustrated by the lack of clarity in what the vessel process truly represents, and the other small inconsistencies in the characters and direction leave me barely choosing the former between a 6 and a 7.",Being John Malkovich
114,bgar-80932,Bizarre but good,7,18 September 2019,This film really revels in the weird and somehow turns out a decent product. It's not my favorite film or anything but it's such a crazy concept that somehow is pretty good and hard to look away. John Cusack and Cameron Diaz really nailed it. I think my favorite part of the movies is Cusack's complete apathy towards his life like the fact that they live with all these random animals and Diaz will like ask him about one and he won't know their names. He lives with a chimp and has no idea it's name. That's crazy. There's random other little things like that that make it an enjoyable experience. This is now the second time I've watched it and both times many years down the road I came up with a similar conclusion about it. For a movie about a portal into someone else's body it is much better than expected.,Being John Malkovich
115,FrenchEddieFelson,A gem resulting of an unexpected mix of Twilight zone and The Monty Python,8,2 May 2019,"This film is excellently made and based on an imaginative, intelligent and wacky script: a depressive puppeteer discovers by chance a mysterious portal in his five-foot tall office located on the 7,5th floor of a Manhattan office building, leading within the head of the movie star John Malkovich. The cast is excellent and the actors co-exist in perfect symbiosis, literally as well as figuratively. The quintet John Cusack + Cameron Diaz + Orson Bean + Catherine Keener + John Malkovich is awesome.A not exhaustive list of my favorite quotes: Meet you in Malkovich in one hour. The truth is for suckers, Johnny boy. Let's have sex on his table and then make him eat an omelette off of it. I comes before U. You don't know how lucky you are being a monkey, because consciousness is a terrible curse. There is truth, and there are lies, and art always tells the truth, even when it's lying. She's got her doctorate in speech impedimentology from Case Western. It's the idea of being inside someone else's skin and seeing what they see and feeling what they feel.",Being John Malkovich
116,PyroSikTh,A Completely Unique Movie Experience,8,20 July 2020,"About eight years ago, my wife and I were shopping when we saw Being John Malkovich on sale. We picked it up, took it the cashier along with our groceries, never expecting the legacy this tiny interaction would hold. Once we got there, my wife in her wheelchair, wedding ring plainly visible, the cashier asked her for ID. We're not big alcohol drinkers, so the thought of carrying ID around with us as fully-grown adults was alien to us. What made this interaction even more bizarre was the fact Being John Malkovich is only a 15. The cashier seemed so completely under the impression that my wife was below the age of 15 that she would not sell us this movie without ID. We were forced to leave it behind, and so for the last eight years or so, Being John Malkovich has been the movie that got away; the tale we always told about that time we couldn't buy a 15-rated movie because of my wife's (who was ten years older than that at the time) youthful looks. We never got round to attempting to buy it again, in part because the story had become such an ingrained part of our shared experiences.
Even last night, poised to finally sit down and be enlightened, my wife was apprehensive to lose such a story, concerned that the last eight years of not-knowing was going to result in utter disappointment. And after Synecdoche, New York, that concern was a very real one. Maybe I had misremembered how good it really was? I had only seen it once before myself, and many years before I even met my wife. What if it was also just a pretentious mess of themes and messages without any cohesive narrative?Being John Malkovich is not that movie. In fact it marks the beginning of both Spike Jonze and Charlie Kaufman's brilliant feature-length careers. Without this movie, we would never have had the masterpieces of Eternal Sunshine or Her. And there's a reason for that. Being John Malkovich is such a unique film, even twenty years later. Watching it is an experience completely like any other you can have sitting on your sofa. It's a surreal, almost dreamlike story, but one that draws you into its world so deeply you don't even question it. We're lulled in with all-out comedy and dry-wit, before delving into the absurd, the quirky, and the shockingly dark. It's transformation from high-brow comedy to dark and challenging art film is so seamless you don't even notice it happening.On it's most basic level (if anything to do with this movie can be considered basic), Being John Malkovich is a movie all about being unhappy with your identity. Craig and Lotte are obsessed with leaving the reality of who they are that they're desperate to live in the world of Malkovich. Even without the ability to actually affect the man initially, just seeing through his eyes is such a revolutionary experience that they become addicted. This is only exacerbated when Maxine manipulates their affections for her through Malkovich. As Craig begins to come accustomed to Malkovich's body, and overtakes him, we see him shift his identity accordingly. The body of a celebrity gives him an unmatched confidence to chase his dreams fully. Meanwhile Lotte's experience is all the more confusing for her, thrust into the body of the opposite gender, and forced to question her sexual identity.It morphs from identity to a movie about the essence of love. Craig is infatuated with Maxine, to the point he's instantly falling over her, despite her constant and cruel rejections. His obsession to be with her is what acts as the catalyst for his obsession to being Malkovich. But for Lotte and Maxine this new dynamic in their lives forces them to question who they are. Love transcends gender and sexuality, and the movie makes this perfectly clear in their relationship. While it's never explicitly stated, Maxine still identifies as hetero, thus requiring the Malkovich vessel to allow them to be together. Without Malkovich between them, Lotte's gender becomes a barrier to their relationship. It's only when Maxine finally accepts who she is that she allows herself to open up her sexuality. Meanwhile the obsessed Craig is left behind to live a life watching what he wants but can never have, forever trapped to a life of loneliness and despair.The fact this movie got made in the first place is an absolute miracle. The biggest stepping stone it had to make was in getting Malkovich interested in the first place. There was no-one else for that role (obviously), and for him to let himself be so open on camera is captivating. Of course it's a fictionalised version of him and his life, but it nonetheless feels so intimate. The fact he allows Kaufman and Jonze to poke fun at him is a testament to how great an actor he can be. Nothing in cinema history will compare to the scene of him in his own subconscious, interacting with a world made up entirely of himself. Ever wanted to see John Malkovich with massive boobs in a low-cut top? (weirdo) Well Being John Malkovich has exactly that! This movie could've been about anyone (one executive suggested Being Tom Cruise, while another potential subject was Steve Buscemi), but it only works because it is the softly spoken yet oddly serious John Malkovich.This isn't a movie for everyone. It's a surrealist nightmare at times, a dark comedy throughout, and a thought-provoking story of love, obsession, desire, and identity focused on a group of three-dimensional yet completely unlikable characters. It maybe comes out a little rough round the edges today, but it still holds up as one of the most one-of-a-kind movie experiences you can get. I give John Malkovich an effervescent 8/10.",Being John Malkovich
117,MattBrady099,Being something that you're not,10,27 March 2015,"Spike Jonze and Charlie Kaufman never seem to shy away from going weird but amazing.The story is about a skillful puppeteer finds the perfect puppet when he discovers a portal in his new office on a ""half"" floor. It leads him literally into the brain of John Malkovich. He and his discoverer try make a living off of others interests while his wife becomes jealous.Charlie Kaufman and Spike Jonze are the two people that can take a weird and strange story and make it amazingly well made and as a viewer you some how correct to it with no reason to it. I don't think I ever came across a bad movie from these genius of directing and writing and Being John Malkovich is another great film from them, they never disappoint me.The one thing that I loved about this movie is how self aware it is. It knows it's weird with some of the scenes that will kind of question yourself for watching it but not in a horrible way more like ""I'm I weirdo for understanding this and also enjoying it?"", something like. The film has a sense of humor to itself and knows it' ridiculous but it goes along with it and man is it funny.The director from Spike Jonze once again dose an amazing job directing this movie. He mix the humor, weird scenes and the fantasy element to it which perfectly came together so well and smoothly. Spike Jonze is fantastic director and in this he really dose shine with his talent of presenting story telling. The writing in this movie is probably hands down the best writing I've seen in a while. The way they pulled off this crazy story line and make it comedy gold is truly genius and worth bringing up because it's not a easy thing to do as it seems impossible for some writers out there and Kaufman makes it look easy.The acting from everyone was excellent. John Cusack, Catherine Keener and Cameron Diaz all three did brilliant in their roles. John Malkovich pretty much playing himself in this movie did a funny performance as himself has he get's taken over by pretty much everyone. I would pay good money to see John Malkovich been given the script for the first time to this movie while he knows nothing about it yet and him reading it and seeing his face has it probably went into WTF mode, but he said yes anywhere because the movie is about him and he give a outstanding performance.For problems I don't really have any to be honest. I couldn't really find anything that I thought wasn't right. Well overall Being John Malkovich is smart, weirdly amazing movie with a fantastic script and outstanding directing.",Being John Malkovich
118,SKG-2,It's my head!!!!,10,1 December 1999,"Though I had liked the few Spike Jonze music videos I've seen(Weezer's ""Buddy Holly"" and the Beastie Boys one), I was hesitant about whether he could make the jump to movies, for, as we know, for every good MTV raised director(David Fincher), there are several bad ones(Michael Bay).  And this is truly a concept which could have gone either way.  But this is one of the most original, funny, and enjoyable movie experiences I've had this year. Every idea pays off in ways you don't expect, all four main actors do well cast against type, and it's awfully hard to pick who's the best(though I suspect John Malkovich will be remembered at Oscar time), the dialogue is great(""Don't stand in the way of my actualization as a man!"" may be the best line of the year), and I can't think of another way to describe this except go see it now.",Being John Malkovich
119,AKS-6,Disappointed -- still a good film though,6,2 May 2000,"I wish I could never expect things from films, before I have seen them. In fact, I wish films would be released in Sweden at the same time as in the USA. I have come to the conclusion (after having seen ""Being John Malkovich"") that *no* film could ever live up to the high expectations I had when I walked into the cinema today. I actually had this feeling of unreality when I sat down at my seat, I was like: ""I can't believe I'm actually going to watch this film!"" The reason for me thinking that is 1) that I have longed to see it for so long and 2) that I live in a small town (population: 95,000) in Sweden where it wasn't even certain that ""Being John Malkovich"" would be shown. So, of course, I was hugely disappointed. Let me tell you right away, though, that I liked the film. The premise is totally bizarre and very fascinating, the acting is brilliant (especially Catherine Keener and John Malkovich), and it was rather entertaining. However, it is also about twenty minutes too long, and I think the original story was taken too far. In the end, it wasn't very funny anymore, only sad since you realize that none of the people in the film are likeable at all, with the exception of poor John Malkovich, who is being used and abused in the worst way, :-). A disappointment, but nevertheless a good film.",Being John Malkovich

Nothing else seemed interesting and no serious thoughts could be generated by having seen it. And I still don't understand why John Malkovich. If you want a famous person, try high profile guys, if you want an anonymous person, try an anonymous person. Anyway, this is the film we've got and this is what we are supposed to judge.

122,DavidSim240183,A delightfully dotty head trip,10,20 April 2007,"Being John Malkovich was one of the most bizarre films to ever emerge from the 90s. Its completely off the wall, its really out there and it seems to exist in a world parallel to our own. It's also one of the most original, intelligent and funniest of films I've ever seen.Consider this; a struggling puppeteer Craig Schwartz (John Cusack) works as a file clerk in an office that looks like the designers had the Munchkins from The Wizard of Oz in mind when they created it. The office is so tiny you have to crane your head sideways to walk about. Craig discovers a tiny door behind a filing cabinet. And like Alice down the rabbit hole, when he goes through it, he emerges into a fantasy land. Or to be more precise, inside the body of the actor John Malkovich. Seeing the world through his eyes. For 15 minutes at a time before being spat out next to the New Jersey Turnpike.What follows is a dizzying journey of identity crises, power trips and lots and lots of wackiness. I don't know when writer Charlie Kaufman dreamt up this joyous gem of a film, or how director Spike Jonze ever convinced A-list stars Cameron Diaz, John Cusack, Charlie Sheen (in a wonderful cameo) and most importantly Malkovich himself to play along, but you're glad they saw the genius in it. This is a truly extraordinary film!Being John Malkovich must qualify as the quirkiest comedy to hit cinema screens since Groundhog Day. In fact the more I compare them, the more alike they seem. They both flow from a central conceit and we just sit back and watch the different possibilities that are opened up. And Jonze is completely engaged with the material right from the moment Craig discovers that portal into Malkovich's head.As you watch the film, it slowly draws you into this oddball situation and somehow makes it all seem strangely plausible. Craig being a puppeteer is understandably enthused when he finds out that not only can he observe the world through John Malkovich, he can exert control over him too. And isn't that one of the greatest fantasies of our time? The opportunity to be a celebrity. Even if its only for a brief time. And bask in the privileges it presents.The one question surely on all our minds is...why John Malkovich? What makes him so special? Of all the people in the world why was he singled out for this honour? Maybe because he's not an obvious choice. John Malkovich is a fine actor, and always puts in superb performances no matter what material he's asked to work with. But he's not quite the superstar say... Tom Hanks is. Or Tom Cruise. The fact that he's a little off the radar in real life makes him ideally cast.We get to see him do simple, ordinary workings of everyday life. Such as eating toast. Taking a shower. Even checking his reflection. You wouldn't think such ordinary tasks would make for compelling viewing, but sometimes even the most ordinary gestures can be as absorbing as the greatest acting.Another thing of continual delights is the wonderful screenplay Kaufman has put at our disposal. He manages to get some extraordinary mileage out of it. Perhaps because Being John Malkovich is a comedy of ideas. And the ideas just keep getting cleverer and cleverer.I love it when Craig and Maxine (a delightfully vampish Catherine Keener), a woman he lusts for who keeps peeling him off her shoe opens up JM Inc. Where people are invited to inhabit Malkovich for $200 a pop. Or when Lotte (an astonishingly drab Cameron Diaz), Craig's wife enjoys being John Malkovich so much she develops feelings for Maxine too. Maxine is having sex with Malkovich at the time! Confused yet?!The acting is super all over. Diaz and Keener are two sides of the same coin. They both love each other, but only as Malkovich! Cusack is a brilliantly dippy drip. And Charlie Sheen puts in a fantastic self-effacing cameo as Malkovich's friend. But of course, the real star here is Malkovich himself.This surely must count as the finest performance of his career. And he's playing himself! Its a great star turn on his part, and shows off his real versatility as an actor. The poor bewildered Malkovich not only has to contend with people walking around his head without his knowledge, but has to contend with them taking over his body too. The way he captures Cusack's mannerisms is astonishing. His puppet dance is a real show stopper. But the crowning delight is the moment when he goes through that tiny door for himself, and sees what's on the other side. Its a scene of inspired lunacy, and showcases Malkovich's talents and range.Some scenes are so surreal your head is spinning with the infinite possibilities BJM keeps dreaming up. Lotte chasing Maxine through the maze of Malkovich's subconscious is so conceptually dazzling it recalls the brilliance of the extraordinarily loopy Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind. Also penned by Kaufman. Talented man!Being John Malkovich stands out as one of the finest comedies of the 90s. Its not nearly as complicated as it sounds. An accessible, incredibly heady experience so rewarding you almost wish there really were portals into other people's heads.Quite brilliant!",Being John Malkovich
123,TheAll-SeeingI,"Fantastical, Absurd, Brilliant",10,2 February 2020,"Few films have earned their own wholly unique space in the Pantheon as has the nearly unimaginable ""Being John Malkovich."" Part comedy and part acid trip gone awry, this is a maniacally sidesplitting meisterwerk of the first order, and one that somehow projects as both deviously plotted and joyously unrestrained.By night, dead-end puppeteer Craig Schwartz (John Cusack) is mired in a futile marriage to pet-centric wife Lotte (Cameron Diaz). By day, he's a clerk for New York's deceptively plain-wrappered LesterCorp, where he toils on the low-ceilinged 7-½ floor. Craig gets the hots for coworker Maxine Lund (Catherine Keener), who flatly can't be bothered. He soon finds a small door behind a filing cabinet, and into it - and into the mind of legendary thespian actor John Malkovich - he crawls. For fifteen minutes per session, Craig can see the world through Malkovich's eyes before being unceremoniously dumped roadside at the Jersey Turnpike. He can't help but share the portal with Maxine, and together, they monetize the Malkovich experience like that of a $200 amusement park ride.Malkovich himself is plainly stunning in his straight-faced repurposing of his real-life self. And despite the onslaught of elite work that followed, director Spike Jonze has never been as magical as he is in his feature film debut. Yet above all else, ""Being John Malkovich"" is a master class in writing - both in its wildly unshackled conception and throughout its methodically brilliant execution - and only the great Charlie Kaufman can be held responsible. This is the film you present to aspiring scribes as screenwriting at its most aspirational. - (Was this review of use to you? If so, let me know by clicking ""Helpful."" Cheers!)

124,gsygsy,comparing John Malkovich,8,22 October 2007,"This wonderful movie is, for me, below Eternal Sunshine Of The Spotless Mind in the triple-crown of Charlie Kaufman screenplays, of which Adaptation takes an honourable third place. In both Adaptation and, to a lesser extent, Being John Malkovich, ingenuity ends up taking precedence over emotion, resulting in two hugely entertaining but ultimately rather cool works of cinematic art. In Eternal Sunshine there is a palpable sense of loss of the loved one which, in spite of the less-than-warm casting of Jim Carrey, raises the script of that movie to a higher level.Of these three master-movies, Being John Malkovich is the one with the most endearing cast. What a bunch! Bumbling Orson Bean, dazzling Christine Keener, crumpled Cameron Diaz, furrowed John Cusak and, of course, that much put-upon all round good sport Mr Malkovich are all a joy. I watched them again on DVD the other evening and it was like meeting old friends.The other outstanding star of this fine film is the editor Eric Zumbrunnen, who performed the same function on Adaptation. Spike Jonze was at the helm of both movies, and needless to say did a superb job, not least in balancing the technical needs of the film with the relationships between the characters.",Being John Malkovich

Everything up to the ""eight months later"" message is fantastic: it's funny, it's smart, it's dark, it's quirky. John Malkovich's performance as himself is inspired. Cusack is a bit stale, but the two women more than make up for it with a pair of terrific performances. The story is bizarre without being over-the-top or silly. The scene where Malkovich goes into his own head is comic brilliance (even moreso when he gets beaned by a beer can as soon as he comes out). But, once Malkovich is taken over and becomes the puppeteer, it just becomes far too strange even for me and the film suffers as a result. Still, it's one of the most unique films ever made and definitely worth a look, at least.",Being John Malkovich
126,Stay_away_from_the_Metropol,An astonishing offering of perhaps the end of high-budget art films in the U.S.,10,15 December 2020,"I will start by saying that the last time I saw this film was in about 2001 when I was 16 years old. I think it's safe to say, based off of my earlier 6/10 IMDb rating, which must have been one of the first IMDb ratings I ever left, that I did not understand quite what was gracing my mind. I remember it being really weird, but that was pretty much all I took from it - apparently I didn't like it much overall. Well, the tables have turned, my friends.This film is absolutely insane to watch now. To me it represents an era of film far gone, one which I'm not sure may ever return - and that's the last period in which the American film industry took chances on art films & gave them legit Hollywood budgets. This movie is so absurdist I can't believe it got nominated for 3 Oscars, let alone got the funding it did in the first place. It breaks every rule it wants to, it's sadistic, it's tragic, it's deathly hilarious in the most unique of ways...it's everything. I was cracking up through the entire first half hour - the laughs take a backseat to story arcs, surrealist concepts, and more dramatic plot twists through the body of the movie, but it's still full of absurdist humor scattered throughout.I kept saying that there's not a single movie I care about John Cusack in, but it turns out I was wrong. He is perfect in this. I don't need to lay out why - if you watch it, it's clear. This is easily one of Cameron Diaz's most outside-of-herself roles, and therefore one of my favorites, by default - she's perfect as well. Then, there's Catherine Keener, whom I did not know in 2001, nor did I understand what she brings to the table here - good Lord, she is pure fire - a ferocious fox - she fully blew my mind. Definitely my favorite character in the movie. And Malkovich...well, what is there to say?I'm so happy that Charlie Kaufman was able to find his way into filmmaking through Spike Jonze's 90's hype and the capitalization of that hype used to move from making top notch music videos to making feature films. This would lead to Adaptation and then Eternal Sunshine of The Spotless Mind, both which I also need to re-visit ASAP. I feel that Adaptation is another film I saw in the theater but did not fully understand, while Eternal Sunshine I loved to death, and found to be one of the most emotional movie viewings I've ever had. Kaufman is a mastermind, and it all started here. This movie is magic. He's having fun, he's offering you challenges, he's taking you on the most epic rollercoaster which covers so many bases, full of so much possibility. It's so much more than what most filmmakers do, and I can tell there is still cathartic value within it for himself as well, even when something comes off as goofy as this - there is still so much soul & viscera within it.This is a singular masterpiece. Even Kaufman's other films don't quite replicate it. It's already saying a lot that there are not a lot of filmmakers who could get away with this - but to make a masterpiece out of it is just mind-blowing. It's revolutionary.",Being John Malkovich

Having only just seen the film for a second time this evening I can't say that I fully understand the movie at this point but nevertheless can appreciate the work as a piece of film rather than interpretive art.I enjoyed almost everything about the film from its surreal plot, its dark humour and its gorgeous photography. The actors also give absolutely wonderful performances, injecting unforgettable energy into their characters, brining them to life effectively throughout. Perhaps what works best in the film's advantage is its originality and imagination, which combine right from the beginning to create a world that always feels familiar yet also remains fantastical.The only real problem I have with the film is its sometimes slow pace that gets the story caught up in unimportant scenes with little importance.

Then came the movie ""Being John Malkovich,"" which along with ""Ace Ventura: Pet Detective(1994),"" ""El Mariachi(1992),"" and ""Welcome to the Dollhouse(1995),"" should be listed in Citadel Press's Films of the Nineties book(See my comment on ""Ace Ventura:Pet Detective"" for this reference).  Upon seeing this film, it's expected that many would ask; Why did they choose John Malkovich? Couldn't they have chosen some other 'scary celebrity,' like Christopher Walken, Anthony James, Richard Lynch, John Saxon, Dennis Hopper, or even Crispin Glover? Was Mickey Rourke throwing too many punches on the set? Did John Lithgow mellow out after ""3rd Rock from the Sun?"" But then you realize, that if they were chosen, the same questions would be asked, and you'd get back to enjoying the film as it is. Like many, I didn't recognize Cameron Diaz at first. I originally thought the female lead was Kyra Sedgwick, until I saw an announcer on Entertainment Tonight put this notion away for me.
 All in all, this is just an elaborate version of those public service announcements that we saw as kids, trying to tell us to be ourselves, instead of somebody we're not. But it's still worth seeing. Looney as it may be, it deserves an Oscar, not in spite of it's weirdness, but because of it.",Being John Malkovich

The supporting cast is magnificent across the board.  Orson Bean is particularly delightful and believable. Keenan and Diaz are pure magic together.  But Malkovich himself gives one of the greatest performances in the history of film.  How could he have not been nominated for supporting actor for this?  He reflects so much and so many changes seamlessly as perfection itself.  A truly original film.

In a society where everyone would pay to erase themselves and become someone else, the protagonist (a misunderstood artist) is the only one who actually needs a ""vessel"" (what a coincidence, an actor) to be himself and express his full potential. Spike Jonze's direction feels a little pedestrian here, as if to contain the exuberance of Kaufman's script and at the same time go along with the dreary tone of the characters' lives.",Being John Malkovich
135,Silverzero,"An original idea and an unusual experience. Good, but only for certain tastes.",9,21 February 2003,"I really didn't know what to expect from this film. It had such an insane concept, I simply had to see it. I can't say that I came out disappointed, but the film was to say the least, surprising. I guess the film's main pitfall is that it's not very enjoyable. The films gradual descent into insanity is probably too surreal for all tastes. The acting is good for the most part. John Cusack gives an un-formulaic but ultimately convincing performance. Cameron Diaz was the most impressive out of the actors and gives her best performance yet. I don't think that Catherine Keener deserved the Oscar nomination she received. She was above standard in her role but certainly not amazing. I'm surprised that John Malkovich would even agree to star in this film but he does a good job of playing himself, Cameron Diaz and John Cusack (don't ask).
Towards the end film gets much too inventive for its own good. But one must admire the film's strange and unique style, slick direction and braveness to attempt such a strange concept. Its not as good as those other films films with daring concepts (The Truman Show etc.) but it's a nice try for what its worth and that's good enough. It's not as good as it should have been buts its a break from formulaic and unoriginal ideas. 6.5 out of 10.",Being John Malkovich

I don't want to use too many talking points in any one review of a film I know I'll be watching again in the near future.All of these actors give their best performances here. I usually don't enjoy John Cusack, Cameron Diaz oe even John Malkovich himself, but as I said they're all fantastic. A lot of this is down to the look of each of these characters, this point doesn't apply to John Malkovich but everyone else is almost unrecognisable. My favourite performance is Katherine Keener's and her character is also my favourite, she's really complex and I relate to her a lot.The presentation is something that really stuck out to me on this most recent viewing as well, the presentation of the sex scenes in particular. They're really funny but they're also quite emotional at the same time. I thought one of these scenes involving Cameron Diaz' character Lotte was genuinely powerful.Anyway this movie's pretty good, you should watch it.",Being John Malkovich
137,hasosch,What happens if you crawl into your own brain?,8,15 December 2009,"I agree with the absolute majority of the hundreds of commentators who have honored this movie that its appearance has, in my words, a similar importance for the future movie-making as ""Citizen Kane"" had at the beginning of the talkies. In short, there are movies before and after ""Citizen Kane"", and now, there are movies before and after ""Being John Malkovich"". Since meanwhile 10 years have passed since BJM was broadcast, this prediction has proved to be right.I personally doubt that still in the 80ies it would have been possible to lance a box office hit based on a scenario solely consisting of metaphysics, and of metaphysics in its purest form: the question of the Self. But since then, especially in the genre of horror movies, we recognize more an more elements which go back to cybernetics, semiotics, non-Aristotelian logic and related topic. The generation of the movies before were restricted to Einsteinian physics. When ""Stars Wars"" came to and end, when people got tired of traveling through the universe, BJM came, and people became more interested in traveling into the self. By the way, the Self is a universe of its own.However, what happens if you crawl into your own brain? Correctly speaking, the basic problem with the identity-eliminating corridor in the movie starts already when other people crawl into your brain: Do you realize that or not? It seems that Malkovich does not feel it. This would mean that he disposes of an alter ego with is not in communication with his ego. Furthermore, this alter ego is not recognizable for the subject as a (common) object. If this would be true, Malkovich would be unable to recognize himself as a subject, since not only can subjects recognize alter egos, they are even characterized by iterating themselves, thus creating subjects of subjects of subjects ... . So, if you crawl into your own brain, you correctly see - as depicted wonderfully in the movie - a large number of Yours who are yourself and at the same time not yourself. (Of course, since the tunnel is an identity-elimination device.) This idea, by the way, is from E.T.A. Hoffmann, mentioned in his diaries and henceforth quoted in many philosophical, psychological and psychiatric studies. Unfortunately, at that point, the movie stops (thematically), and it would be highly interesting to see how a director would deal with the fact that one person is dissolved into several egos without drifting into the false concept of schizophrenia. A logic, in which this splitting of individuality is possible, is a logic which transcends by far the Aristotelian light-switch logic and leads into a universe whose discovery will be infinitely more interesting than the time-travels through worm leaks or Einstein-Rosen-Bridges with which old-generation Science Fiction has entertained us during decades.",Being John Malkovich
138,Bob Pr.,REVISED REVIEW: A tour de force at 2 different levels,10,26 November 1999,"This revises my previous review (14Nov99; #54 in the Comments Index)Few who see this movie can ever forget it, it's so original and creative, so well acted by a marvelous cast, and it's so funny.But this is a movie that needs to be seen a second time. In a first viewing, you're so busy hanging on to the roller coaster -- sort of like an action film (e.g., ""Romancing the Stone"" minus the threats of danger to the characters) -- that you miss its deeper meaning. The two levels complement each other and make each the richer.At the first, most obvious level, this movie is for enjoying rather than stating philosophical issues. But along the way, while it provides few satisfactory answers, it does raise some intriguing questions: -- do we feel that we'd be more fulfilled as someone else, maybe someone famous, than as ourselves? -- what's the difference and what's appealing, between men and women's sexual experience?; would some women enjoy or envy men's faster arousal? -- would some men like their sexual experience feminized? -- what's it like to be a movie star? -- what's the source of those various conflicting urges we sometimes feel within us; could we say they come from the prompting of others voices/urges within us? But the most insistent question for most of the characters is how they can feel most self-actualized and they try to find an answer, not in being really themselves, but rather as puppeteers who pull someone else's strings.And at this first level, the characters' quests are just material for the fun plot. But don't look for thorough consistencies (e.g., Maxine's early frank sexual opportunism/ predation vs. her later stance; or aspects of the Craig & Lotte relationship in its earlier vs. later stages). And don't look for deep answers; just enjoy the most original, creative ride in movies for some years.The second, deeper level becomes clearer with a second viewing. In a sense it's very much an insiders' joke about directors, directing, and making movies. The beautiful, stunning scenes we see (early in the film) of lifeless, wooden puppets becoming so brimming with life, movement, and feeling, these state Spike Jonze's love and homage to his craft -- who wouldn't want to do this (these scenes ask) and make ideas and people come so alive? The film director is, metaphorically, a puppeteer who brings out of his/her marionette/actors new lives into new roles. It's the high from this experience that Lotte craves when she announces she wants a sex change operation; the sex of the first level is a metaphor for creativity at this second level. And, after making a film is over, after the high of making a vision come alive, it's like being dumped into the banal, the prosaic, the commonplace -- almost like being dropped beside the New Jersey Turnpike after having lived in the magic of Oz.But there are problems that any director/ puppeteer faces. Being creative and talented is no fun unless there's an appreciative audience; that makes fame and ""box office"" valuable and worth pursuing because it gives more avenues and freedom. And while a puppeteer has the advantage of owning the ""actors"" (the marionettes), any one director has many competitors wanting to occupy the chosen actors and invest them with his/her vision. And there's always another director/ puppeteer waiting to grab them.And the role of Maxine, I think I understand how this fits with the various people involved with making films -- but you'll want something to also figure out at this second level, don't you?I very much appreciate Robert Lesser's review (#51 in the Comments Index, q.v.); we share similar views and seeing his comments supported the thinking expressed here.",Being John Malkovich
139,basrutten,Sick and NOT funny,4,21 November 2001,"I had heard a lot of good things about this movie and was looking forward to seeing it, but it was a huge disappointment.First of all, it's supposed to be a comedy but I don't think I've laughed once, maybe I smiled a couple of times. In this movie, it's supposed to be funny that an office building has a seven-and-a-halfed floor, that an apartment is filled with animals (hello, Ace Ventura anyone?) and that nobody seems to know what parts John Malkovich played.As for the acting, John Cusack is terrible, John Malkovich hardly gets a chance to act and for some obscure reason Cameron Diaz is made almost unrecognizable with a very ugly hairdress and a very boring part.The story is original, yes, but it's also completely sick and confusing, involving a woman having a 'lesbian' relationship with another woman who is inside John Malkovich's head, John Cusack locking up his girlfriend, a sick guy that survives by getting inside other people's heads etc.
Maybe this review is a little confusing, but so was the movie and I really don't know what else to say about it except for the fact that it's very bad.",Being John Malkovich
140,lib-4,Bipolar disorder in a film,8,6 June 2000,This is the most original film I have seen in years. I have always been a fan of Malkovich and Cusack.

Jonz did a great job of making a very unusual film.,Being John Malkovich
141,nesfilmreviews,Brilliant.,9,7 August 2013,"""Being John Malkovich"" must surely rank as one of the most inventive, original, and yet daring films of the last ten years. A metaphysical journey about the desire to transform oneself involving identity, gender, and creativity. It's silly, unpredictable, and completely faithful to its distinctive, perverse vision. A brilliant premise written by the Charlie Kaufman, and masterfully directed by Spike Jonze. A truly an ingenious film and considered a modern day classic. Craig Schwartz (John Cusack) is stuck in a frustrated rut in his life. His pet obsessed wife Lotte (Cameron Diaz) seems more concerned with providing a decent home to various animals as opposed to satisfying his marriage needs. Also, money is drying up, Craig's dreams of becoming a world-famous puppeteer appear to be eroding, and he is pressured into finding a job. Because of his quick hands, a skill necessary for artful puppetry, Craig applies for a job as a filing clerk. His job requires him to work on the seventh and a half floor in a strange office block. His days are spent trying to persuade the object of his attention Maxine (Catherine Keener), into having an affair with him. While losing a file behind a storage cabinet one day, Craig discovers a strange and murky tunnel hidden behind the cabinet. Crawling inside, Craig finds the tunnel to actually be a portal, and the destination is inside the actor John Malkovich's head! Although Craig has no say with regards to Malkovich's actions, he can clearly witness and influence what the actor is doing. Fifteen minutes later, Craig is forced out of Malkovich's head, and dumped along side the New Jersey turnpike. Part of the pleasure in watching ""John Malkovich"" is seeing these actors at full creative throttle, and knowing how much they relished the insanity of the script. But it's clearly Malkovich who has the most fun here. Spoofing oneself is usually therapeutic, but for Malkovich whose reputation as an intellectual prima donna, must have been ecstatic at an incredibly unique opportunity. Without spoiling what follows, ""Being John Malkovich"" features a fine cast of dryly- comic actors who are very much in on the joke. That can even be said of Charlie Sheen, who turns up for some wicked self-parody in a film that also features cameo appearances by Sean Penn, Brad Pitt. ""Being John Malkovich"" doesn't bog down in allegories, while remaining tremendously entertaining and thought provoking, and definitely worthy of repeat viewings. Fantastic performances all around by the entire cast, but especially by Cusack and Malkovich. Nominated for three Academy Awards.",Being John Malkovich

It's an un-funny one-line joke stretched out interminably. (The only good moment - I guess that's worth the ""1"" rating - is when SPOILER Malkovich ""becomes"" himself; but that's not nearly enough for a whole movie.)B. It's smarmily, cloyingly, smugly artsy-fartsy, in a way no other movie I can think of ever pulls off. It wants me to be impressed by the way the film was loaded into the camera.C. It's bo-o-oring. It goes on, and on, and on. When I rented the DVD, my wife and I watched the latter half at increasing speeds.

143,JoshtheGiant,Completely Bizarre,7,8 January 2006,"Being John Malkovich is easily the weirdest movie I have ever seen. It is completely bizarre. The story is more original I think than anything since the beginning of cinema when well everything was original. Charlie Kaufman has written three near classics called Adaptation, Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, and Being John Malkovich. And this Being John Malkovich is the best by far. And although it doesn't have the best performance of the three which is held by Nicolas Cage for Adaptation it has the second best in that of John Malkovich, who plays himself and a bunch of other himselfs. The script is one of the best ever made into a film. It is flawless with great characters and dialogue, not to mention the plot. The direction is also wonderful as are the visual effects. The one big thing I didn't like about Being John Malkovich is John Cusack who although much better than usual still can't give a good performance.",Being John Malkovich
144,Brogan,A creative and weird movie.,9,9 November 1999,"This is a bizarre film with a bizarre story. However, it is a very creative story.  Craig Schwartz (John Cusack) gets a job at a company on the 7 1/2 floor of a office building. While organizing some files, Craig finds a door behind a filing cabnet.  Inside the door is a portal into another world, the world of another person.  Craig can experience thoughts, feelings, and see the actions of this other person.  The only thing, it that this other person is famous actor John Malkovich! However, Craig can only experince this for only 15 minutes, then he winds up on the side of the road at the New Jersey turnpike.  Craig and his sexy co-worker Maxine (Catherine Keener) see this door as a money profit business.  Yet, Craig has also fallen in love with Maxine, eventhough he's already married to an animal loving pet store owner, Lotte (Cameron Diaz).  From there on is a wild and twisted story that keeps going up hill until the very end. I have never seen a film quite like this one.  This seems like something that former Monty Python member Terry Gilliam would have thought of.  It's very creative, and at the same time twisted, strange, and very very funny!  I thought the idea of a building being on the 7 1/2 floor was creative, but there's a lot more creative images and settings than just that scene.  And the dialogue is also very witty!  With such lineslike ""Nobody's looking for a puppeteer in today's wintry economic climate,"" is the most wittiest lines that I have heard actors give since the Marx Brothers. The acting is also very well done.  John Cusack is excellent, as usual, as the man who torn between two women, seeing the world through two people. Cameron Diaz took a big risk playing a non-glamorous role, and she still manages to pull through.  Catherine Keener is also great as the seductive co-worker who has plans of her own.  And of course, John Malkovich himself is also very enjoyable as, well, himself. But Malkovich is such a great sport, that he even allows the story to make fun of himself. Director Spike Jonze (Vig from THREE KINGS) is going to be a popular director because of this film.  He directs the film along the same simialr lines as a Terry Gilliam film: dark, bizarre, and funny.  And writer Charlie Kaufman shows a promising career with this being his first major film.  I would be very upset if this film doesn't get a Oscar for Best Original Screenplay, it deserves it!  ***** (out of five)",Being John Malkovich

Orson Bean gives a classic performance as the old-guy boss at Cusack's job. He gives a very Leslie Nielson-esque performance. This is definitely a great one for Cusack. His character was fantastic too! The best one in the film actually. Charlie Sheen as Charlie Sheen was a nice touch too. Directed by Spike Jonze who was Conrad in Three Kings.The last half of the film, however, starts to get a little silly. A love story between two of the characters starts to ruin the film and a gun-chase scene just derails things a bit.

Perhaps the most original release in a year that had several very original releases ('Fight Club' and 'The Matrix' were both also released in '99), the film's playful creative energy had an effect on screenwriters, directors, actors and producers that can hardly be overstated.

Cameron Diaz plays his wife Lotte, and Catherine Keener is good as his co-worker Maxine. They decide to charge people two hundred dollars for the pleasure of visiting Mr Malkovich, but he soon finds out, and the scene when he himself goes through the portal is amazing, and the best scene in the film. The scenes when Craig and Lotte are inside Malkovich reminded me slightly of the final segment of Woody Allen's Everything You Wanted To Know About Sex....But Were Afraid To Ask, when a group of people are inside a man's body controlling him, and also the movies Fantastic Voyage and Innerspace came to mind also.

I had heard good things about it so I was excited. When I was done my thoughts were It was good but disappointing. The reason I think Malkovich is disappointing is in its script. Charlie Kaufman has come up with a brilliant, original idea. But I didnt find the dialogue anything special, it was only a tiny cut above average. The idea was great and the film has some brilliant scenes, for example, the restaurant full of Malkovich's was the best scene of the movie. Its just that I felt not enough effort was put into the dialogue. Being John Malkovich was actually more entertaining than funny.But Spike Jonze seemed to have an idea of what hes doing. He gets good performances from the cast. John Cusack is quite good here, and im not a huge fan of him. However, I am a huge fan of Cameron Diaz and she does very good work here. Catherine Keener was good, but definitely not worth an oscar nomination. However, the standout is John Malkovich. Its really difficult for an actor to play himselves, and Malkovich does a great job.

His nomination for this year's Oscar as best director is more than deserved, and I can't understand why this amazing film that is ""Being John Malkovich"" wasn't nominated for best picture. Well, maybe that's because the Academy is too old-fashioned but, if they were, they wouldn't nominate ""American Beauty"", last year's best. In fact, ""Being John Malkovich"" is 99's second best, being only after ""American Beauty"" on my top 10 (note that I haven't seen ""Magnolia"" because it wasn't released in Brazil yet). So... let's talk about the movie!Have you ever wanted to be someone else? What about a famous person? What about John Malkovich, even if it lasts only 15 minutes?People can say everything they want about ""Being John Malkovich"", but conventional is the last thing it is. The story, about a puppeteer named Craig (John Cusack), who founds by chance in his office a portal to John Malkovich's head, has a wonderful surrealism. The screenplay is a explosion of originality, mixing delightful absurd elements with very, very funny comedy and some drama.The film starts showing Craig's life with his weird wife Lotte (Cameron Diaz- you won't recognize her), who lives with an ape named Elijah (which has a childhood trauma), a dog, lots of birds, an iguana and other animals. He is a puppeteer and has no job. One day he finds one at the 7.5 (!) floor of a building, where he meets some strange people, as his boss, Dr. Lester (a 105 year old man), and a secretary named Floris, who makes confusion with words. His work colleague is the cold Maxine (Catherine Keener), for whom he falls in love. After he finds that portal to Malkovich's head, his life totally changes- for better or worse. Some weird and hilarious things will happen, including lesbian love and a menage-a-trois with two people. But everything gets more complicated when John Malkovich enters his own head (the most hilarious scene), and when Craig starts to control Malkovich as if he were one of his dolls. That's when the film starts to show its dramatic side. But it doesn't mean that ""Malkovich"" is irregular. Yes, it has a hilarious first one hour or some more and the last forty minutes are more serious if you look by a side. However, drama, comedy and fantasy are mixed very well, not resulting in a film full of gaps and skips as ""Edtv"".Under a surreal story, writer Charlie Kaufman hides important messages and morals. All the characters are very well developed and the cast is just fantastic. John Cusack, Cameron Diaz and John Malkovich should have been nominated to the Oscar, but the great Catherine Keener was the only lucky one.So watch ""Being John Malkovich"". It's the only thing I can say. It's weird, wild, funny, twisted, surprising, unusual and totally unpredictable. You shouldn't miss this one anyway.(A perfect) 10/10!Spike Jonze is a genius!",Being John Malkovich

157,quinimdb,Being John Malkovich,9,26 June 2017,"Since every human being is constantly tethered to their bodies and their perception of the world through that body, the curiosity of what life is like from another person's perspective is intrinsic to human nature. So what if the person whose body you could inhabit was critically acclaimed actor John Malkovich? And what if the portal to his mind was in an office with a low ceiling because it was in between two floors of a skyscraper? ""Being John Malkovich"" answers both of these questions and many more with a surprising amount of insight and depth.Craig Schwartz is a struggling puppeteer performing on the streets of New York to an audience who doesn't want him. He has a wife, Lotte, but they are clearly somewhat distant from each other, and she is often at work or trying to convince him to get a job. Finally, he obliges when money runs low, and he ends up filing cabinets at the odd floor 7 1/2. It's telling that his boss thinks that he has a speech impediment because his assistant has trouble hearing and often misinterprets his words: the only window into how he is perceived by others is filtered through the imperfect perceptions of those around him. In this office he sees Maxine Lund and slowly becomes desperate for her, even acting out a romantic encounter with her with his puppets while proclaiming it's the chance to feel what someone else feels that draws him to puppeteering. Soon after he stumbles upon a window into a man's brain, and while John Malkovich may have seemed like a random choice by screenwriter Charlie Kaufman, I don't think it's an accident that the man they begin to live through is an actor himself, constantly trying to immerse himself in many different roles and different lives. As Craig and Lotte soon find out, completely changing their role and appearance in life helps them to further discover who they are and what they want. By discovering that her true self is not the gender or appearance or age that their assigned, Lotte realizes she feels more comfortable as a man. Of course, they do begin to exploit this sudden discovery as most human beings would do. Maxine does it for control, and Craig does it for Maxine's adoration, but it is only a matter of time until Malkovich himself finds this portal.Malkovich inevitably entering this portal himself could've been handled in a plethora of ways, but how it is handled is brilliant, funny, thought provoking, and it deepens the themes of the film. It shows how our mind ultimately compares everyone around us to ourselves because it is all that we have to compare to, and it also shows how many different versions of oneself exist within one's own mind, each revealing themselves at different times. And this isn't even the last big surprise of the movie. The climax exists entirely in Malkovich's subconscious. Although even through all of the film's heady ideas and absurdism it remains a very fundamentally human film. As Craig gets a hold of controlling Malkovich, they toy with the idea that one's position in life and preexisting image often dictates their success, but the surprisingly tragic ending reveals that what is at the core of who Craig is, regardless of the body he inhabits, is who he desires, and this is ultimately what dictates his actions, and it isn't hard to see that this desire is what dictates every other character as well, especially when the person one desires is just out of reach.",Being John Malkovich
158,extravaluejotter,I should have hated it but...,7,4 November 2006,"""Being John Malkovich"" isn't easy to categorise. Let's just say that the story of a frustrated and bitter puppeteer who discovers a way to get inside the mind of one of America's greatest actors isn't standard Hollywood fare. John Malkovich deserves a lot of credit for allowing this bizarre film to be made. Somehow it wouldn't have been the same if writer Charlie Kaufman had called it ""Being Michael Douglas"" or ""Being Jim Carrey"". Looking at the negative comments for this film, it seems that even the art-house crowd are split down the middle. Too pretentious to be mainstream, yet too gonzo to be a ""Cult Classic"", ""Being John Malkovich"" is the cinematic equivalent of Marmite.You'll either love this film or you'll hate it. I recommend that you find out, one way or the other - you can always switch off after 30 minutes if you don't.Personally, I love Marmite.",Being John Malkovich

""Being John Malkovich"" is breathtakingly original, wonderfully warped and it sustains its demented tone all the way through, rather than casting it aside at some convenient point to focus on another lame good vs. evil showdown. (As so many other initially intriguing films do, with a good example being ""Dark City"".)The cast here is superb, especially John Cusack's lonely, lovestruck puppeteer and Catherine Keener's emotionally unavailable, ruthlessly unreachable object of seemingly everyone's desire.  (The movie really belongs to her; she's created one of the most fascinatingly inscrutable characters that I can recall.) And what wacky, refreshingly blunt dialogue. It has a cartoonish feel to it, like their words are frying pans to conk each other on the head with. From Keener's ""I am dubious"" when Cusack corners her for a date, to her ""Craig! I don't find you attractive!"" when he, and his wife, both attempt to seduce her at the same time. Or Cusack's wife (Cameron Diaz) brutally telling him ""Don't crowd me, Craig"", or Charlie Sheen, in a funny cameo as himself, explaining to a distraught Malkovich that ""The truth is for suckers."" Or a lukewarm fan telling Malkovich ""You were really great in that movie where you played the retard."" And finally, in one of the funniest lines I can remember, Malkovich, after his reality has been severely tampered with, screaming at some guy in a bar ""I am not John Malkovich!"" then attacking him.The movie careens off in all sorts of unanticipated directions, while always remaining faithful to character and premise. It explores notions of identity, celebrity, mortality and finality in a very unique way. But at its core it's really about the pain of loneliness and the inability to connect. And it all climaxes with a truly ingenious and exciting chase scene. What a gloriously nutty, seductively sullen vision. It will leave you a little dizzy when it's done.",Being John Malkovich
160,KFL,"Highly entertaining, but not very deep",7,13 August 2001,"This is a trip to the circus, side-show freaks and all, and shouldn't be confused with anything more profound. A lot of fun to watch, certainly; but this movie misses an opportunity to explore just what is involved in ""taking over"" another human being--physically, psychologically, emotionally.
Anyone really interested in such themes of subjugation of one individual by another should have a look at an old classic, Ingmar Bergman's ""Persona"", which examines in detail a process in which one stronger personality overwhelms another. BJM isn't too deep, but is endlessly inventive, darkly humorous, and features one of the most bizarre scenes ever committed to film (you'll know it when you see it).",Being John Malkovich
161,cofemug,The best movie of 1999,10,19 January 2000,"Hands down, I loved this movie better than any one that I have seen this year.  I saw it before it came out for the first time.  I went in like everybody else, not knowing what it was about.  I laughed until I cried from being so offronted with audacity.  It was funnier than anything I saw, including South Park, Election, and Go.  It was a brave new movie that challenged how all movies were made, in general.All of the actors and actresses in this movie seemed to know what Jonze was going for.  They all acted psychotic and unbelievable in a movie that was psychotic and unbelievable.  There is absolutely no realism to this movie, nor does it ever attempt to be a realistic movie.  From the surreal intro to the creepy ending, this movie never strayed from way out of left field.  It stayed its course, and everybody who hates this be damned.I really would love to spill the beans about everything in this movie, it is so wonderful...but I can't.  I can't even give away any basic plot points. I went in blind and appreciated it all the more for going in blind that I do it now with all of my movies.  I will go in blind, except knowing about performances or genres.  I almost started this paragraph spilling plot points that are basic, but I deleted them.  Go in and be surprised.However, I cannot recommend this movie to everybody.  This is a brash movie that will shock and offend some in ways that they have not imagined.  It is a black comedy, darker than most.  However, there is no death in this movie. It takes its humor from better, more intellectual sources than that.  But, it is dark, and most will hate the movie for being brash, and not having many likeable characters.  However, the rest will love this movie for being brave, brash, and unlike anything we've ever experienced before.----------------10",Being John Malkovich

Some settings to generate an unusual atmosphere work (i.e., the seventh and half floor with a low ceiling), while the others don't (i.e., the Schwartzs' unusual pets such as a chimpanzee). Malkovich should have differentiated his acting more when Craig Schwartz (John Cusack) is inside and controls him. The Malkovich-inside-Malkovich sequence, which is somehow reminiscent of an endlessly looped picture on a monitor when a camera is aimed at the monitor, is not unpredictable enough and seems to be added only to satisfy some demanding audience who would question this if it was not there.",Being John Malkovich

The actual plot with the cult, however, was a bit uninteresting and not nearly as fun as Malkovich and the other three leads. I also believe the ending was a bit off. Why exactly does Maxine get a happy ending? While not quite as awful as Craig, I don't think she was very good, but I suppose she just has a rapid change of heart we didn't get to see? And why does Craig lose the ability to puppeteer the person's body? A bit confusing and unsatisfying, but not enough to take away from the movie's stronger aspects.",Being John Malkovich

I'll say it straight out. Being John Malkovich is weird. VERY weird. It has random moments in it that you won't get for a few seconds, but its funny. I can't really blame Jonze for this, mostly Kaufman for conceiving the way of executing his concept - being in the mind of someone famous. This movie is sad, has great acting, flawed characters, etc. John Cusack does a good job as well as Cameron Diaz but the 2 stars of this film are Catherine Keener (oscar nominated role) as well as John Malkovich (who didn't get a nomination). The characters in this movie are unsually inconsiderate, they will destroy each other for stupid reasons. The only person you feel bad for is John Malkovich because he has to go through all of this s***. I felt this movie deserved best director and best screenplay, but it didn't win... Overall, impressive comedy, sometimes too wacky. I'd recommend seeing Adaptation over this but do as you please. 9/10",Being John Malkovich

It sits there peering at me for some inexplicable reason.Last night I actually decided to watch it, not expecting much at all. The thing that struck me is the funny, silly, tongue-in-cheek nature of this film, which shouldn't be taken too seriously. But is it a comedy? Not really.The acting is immense, especially Catherine Keener (who I never liked before) as an utterly sarcastic, super-empowered cynic. John Cusack and Cameron Diaz play the part of a wacky couple involved in a quaint marriage, happily in love, but weirdly going about their individual existences at the same time.And then things get interesting. A portal is discovered into the brain of John Malkovitch, enabling 'visitors' to become John Malkovitch for 15 minutes. This experience is so overwhelming and enlightening it has the effect of a new drug and, once experienced, all the visitor wants to do is go back through the portal and live that experience over and over again. This affects relationships, marriages, interpersonal feelings, and even sexual orientation, especially between the married couple.By the end of the movie everything is completely on its head. Multitudes of paying customers, even a clan of elderly people, compete for JM hits and control over the host.What struck me the most about this film was how humorous and enjoyable it was in comparison to my overly serious perception of it in the past, as though it was supposed to mean something. In fact, it means very little at all, but emphasises how marriages can be fickle to the point of self-destruction.",Being John Malkovich
167,kylehodgdon,Odd And Interesting,7,9 January 2010,"I feel that to say that this is and odd yet interesting movie really sums it up. ""Being John Malkovich"" begins just as visually interesting as it does psychologically. After a wonderful marionette performance, the movie really entices the audience with the fascinating seven and a half floor. The characters we meet all have little tidbits about them that really make us want to know more. Why does the boss character not think that he can be understood? What is with the dark woman who Craig is lusting over? These are great ways to make the audience really want to keep watching.From there we get to the part where the characters ""become"" John Malkovich. Everybody loves the idea of being a celebrity actor and the lives of everyone twist out of control. The idea of being able to control someone else as if they were really you seems to be the overall motif and the movie runs with that notion.I give this movie a seven, or a ""quite good"" rating because it is very interesting to watch and the idea of it is neat. Going into a real life guy instead of a made up actor for the film was excellent. But I cannot give this film a higher rating because it was a bit to strange for my taste. I know that some people love this type of thing and ""Being John Malkovich"" tops their list of best films ever. But personally I tend to like movies with a bit more realism involved.The last thing I want to say is that John Malkovich should be commended for taking this role.

This is probably down to its weirdness. Getting over the strange plot, it is a thoroughly absorbing and entertaining film.  All the main characters are truly horrible - even the Cameron Diaz ""mouse-of-a-wife"" character (unusual part for her) is a tough bitch underneath the weak, sugar surface.  In fact the chimpanzee was probably the only character I genuinely liked. Which is fine, by the way, because although you don't like the characters, they are quirky and interesting enough that you want to see what happens to them.Takes a while to warm up - Jane slept through most of the first half hour which made the plot wicked difficult to explain.

This was a distinctly different genre than Star Wars and Star Trek. Writer Charlie Kaufman's ""Being John Malkovich"" is the best film story ever of that original sci-fi genre.Not only does it have an incredibly imaginative entertaining story, the film is perfectly directed and acted. Despite being a comedy, Kaufman's screenplay demonstrates an understanding of the complexities of human emotions, and even has moments of philosophical questioning.In addition to starting with a great screenplay, the director Spike Jonze and the cast are all excellent. Catherine Keener exudes sexy manipulative bitch without relying on great beauty. John Malkovich gets a chance to exercise all of his acting talents. Charlie Sheen has a cute cameo as himself as a womanizer. Cameron Diaz was great in a role as the dowdy wife of the main protagonist, an artistic puppeteer (John Cusack).

However, there is a section about half an hour long where John Cusack is absent. This ruined the film! He was the strongest character and suddenly we're stuck with John Malkovich. John has undergone a major character change which I HATED and could not accept. It's so ridiculous and so awkward that the movie stops being funny and is suddenly a horrifying mess. There is a lot of plot holes and a lot unanswered at the end. It was almost worth it, but there is a lot that doesn't really make sense.

The seventh floor and a half, may be cute (not really meaning) as well as the film that subtly shows us that some artists are immediately rewarded for the merit of being already famous.That said, the rest of the movie and ideas, however, are too forced and uninteresting and especially not thrilling and really funny or hilarious as they could have been by not exaggerating in its contours and adding less absurdity and instead more comic comedy situations. Some moments make you smile (not laugh) as the loop by Malkovich in his mind and the situation of the actor bewildered itself, virtually almost involuntarily raped while, some others, are not really necessary or meaningful.Personally, I'm used to engaging and genial plots as those seen in some of Terry Gilliam's movies. Malkovich is talented as always, but as someone else commented, it is not enough just a brilliant idea to make of a unique film a masterpiece.I found some main ideas as absurd even brilliant, but the film, in the long run, rather boring and overrated.6/10",Being John Malkovich

Anything involving John Malkovich is hilarious.  It's funny to see him react to this strangeness.  The whole 71/2 floor bit is flat out funny.

It's not him really, it's the character.  I hated him.  I think that you're supposed to hate him.  But how can you like a movie when you hate the main character?Bad point # 3: THE WEIRDNESS!  Oh my is this movie weird.  The whole puppet thing is just stupid.  I know that because Cusack's character is a puppeter allows him to fully control people, but who really cares?Bad Point # 4:  Way too artistic.  I go to movies to be entertained. Sometimes I go for study.  Sometimes I go to solve a puzzel (Usual Suspects).  But I never go to artistic movies.  Why?  The same reason I think painters who throw a bucket of paint onto a canvis and call it ""art"" are insane and should be locked up.  This movie is really depressing.

182,SSJAniFan,People say this is a comedy. They're wrong.,1,28 June 2003,"SPOILERSIf anything, this poor excuse for a film is a tragedy/angst movie. Malkovich has to suffer as an outside force causes him to forever lose his mind.  When the invading Cusack does leave, Malkovich is happy to be himself one last time before having someone else invade his brain, and then he's gone forever.  Cusack's character has his own life crumble apart after his wife(Diaz) has an affair with someone else in Malkovich's body, and as a result, he snaps, locks her in a cage, and invades John himself.  Things go from bad to worse, as his mind is forever trapped in the daughter of his wife and her lover in the film's end.  I do not remember any humorous scenes in this entire film.  I won't be watching this one ever again.BOTTOM LINE:  .......I pretty much said everything in my review.",Being John Malkovich
183,Criticalstaff,Without a doubt the weirdest movie ever,9,27 April 2020,"This movie takes the most absurd premise : What would happen if there was a tunnel that lead to John Malkovitch's brain. The film's quality resides in its confidence. The confidence to stick to whatever weird premise it itself has set up and to run it. And when you think the film could not get any more absurd, well the movie does it again and doubles down on the weirdness. It does it twice.John Cusack is Craig: a pathetic talented puppeteer that is down his luck. Oh and he is a pervert. Everybody in this film is a sexual deviant (in an ironic twist the only character who did not surprise me was Charlie Sheen playing restrained Charlie Sheen). His wife Lotte is an employee at a pet-store. They are both unhappy and locked in their miserable lives. Cusack and Diaz steal the show in the first act, and like the weirdness, I thought the acting could not be topped.
Craig finds a new job and meets the stunning Maxine, who is as evil and cunning as she is beautiful. Craig is obsessed by Maxine, who rejects him. The film itself suggest that Maxine might be a witch but that might be the case, I found her to be the most unpleasant woman ever. Which is on purpose because that is exactly the kind of nihilism that the film engages with.
At his new job, which already abounds of weirdness and absurdity, Craig finds one day, behind a filing cabinet, a tunnel that lead to ""inside"" John Malkovitch, the actor.
Craig is enticed by Maxine to profit from the situation and they start selling tickets to the mind of John Malkovitch. However, Craig lets his wife try the tunnel one night. Lotte is in Malkovitch's head, at the same time that Maxine goes out on a date with him.
Lotte falls for Maxine, and declares she wants a sex-change. Maxine falls for Lotte and manipulates Malkovitch in order to have sex with her. Craig is left out and excluded so he locks-up is wife and takes control of Malkovitch with the help of his puppeteering skills.At that point, I thought the movie was the weirdest, but it became weirder. Craig becomes Malkovitch full time and Craig-Malkovitch starts to resemble Craig, he stops being an actor, he becomes a world-renown puppeteer, and he grow his hair longer and marries Maxine. This is where John Malkovitch becomes the star(and the focus of the story) and gives an amazing performance. The movie stops and plays out as a gossip-documentary on the life of John Malkovitch.Then the film becomes even weirder. There is a conspiracy plot, which involves the now excluded Lotte. Lotte chases Maxine to murder her through the painful memories of the legit John Malkovitch. They end up in a lesbian couple.
The film is the most absurd. The strangeness is reinforced by the fact that there are no jokes. The movie plays the subject matter so straight-faced. It is rather dark and sad. But it is unique.On the technical level everything is perfect: the camera-work, the lighting, the music, the sets. It is a very visual movie. There is absolute mastery of all these elements. However, they are all at the service of the weirdest story ever.
I do not really know what to make of it, and I guess that was the point. The nihilism of the film is it's shell, but also it's substance.
There are no proper themes at play. You could argue that there is a criticism of celebrity-worship and a reflexion on 90s existential angst (same as in American Beauty, the Matrix, Office Space, Fight Club). But it is too subtle and submerged by the absurdity.1999 is regarded as the last good year in American Cinema. And while this movie might not be what people had in mind; it certainly is a pinnacle of absurdity that has not been topped since.",Being John Malkovich
184,matlefebvre20,"""... this is a very odd thing. It's supernatural, for lack of a better word.""",8,28 May 2008,"When we talk about bad movies, we often say that they are so because they are weird, strange or because they don't make any sense at all. But ""Being John Malkovich"" is just too much weird and too much complicated to be rated as a bad movie.John Cusack stars as Craig Schwartz, a struggling puppeteer who lives with a dog, a talking parrot, a chimpanzee and an almost unrecognizable Cameron Diaz as his wife.Craig badly needs money, so he takes a job as a filing clerk and he works for a New York firm located on the seventh-and-a-half floor of a Manhattan building.Things just get even stranger when Craig discovers a secret tiny doorway that leads him directly into the mind of actor John Malkovich (played by John Malkovich). After having lived a quarter of hour into Malkovich's head, Craig is ejected from it and mysteriously finds himself on the side of the New Jersey Turnpike, just outside New York City.Craig and his new colleague Maxine (Catherine Keener) have the idea of making people who want to live the same experience pay for it. So, Craig and Maxine ""rent"" Malkovich's mind fifteen minutes at a time and people become a famous Hollywood actor for that amount of time.""Being John Malkovich"" is directed by Spike Jonze, better known for his numerous music videos, and masterfully written by Charlie Kaufman. His screenplay is brilliant and of an almost unreached level of originality and perfectly allies surrealism and the philosophy of mind.Jonze evidently does a great job in the director's chair, with some astonishing and breathtaking moments. Unfortunately for him, Kaufman is the real star of this movie and so is his simply unreal and completely crazy story. At some moments, we could find ourselves wondering what does Kaufman have in his mind, if he didn't simply put his brain on autopilot and went on a wave of automatic writing.Only a few examples are enough to illustrate my point of view. First of all, we get to know that Craig's wife works in a pet store, but is it a good reason to keep a dog, a talking parrot and a chimpanzee named Elijah in their apartment? And then, we get to wonder how can people work on the seventh-and-a-half floor of a building. And when we finally get the ""rational"" explanation, we wonder why we asked that question instead of shutting up.And the characters we get to meet are not any more normal. The first example is the secretary who interprets every word wrong. Then, Craig's new boss, Dr. Lester, who is 105-year-old and who drinks almost exclusively carrot juice, which explains why he ""pisses orange"".But except the surrealist moments, the movie is also one of the most thought-provoking and philosophical motion pictures of the recent years. Actually, 1999 seems to be the year of philosophy in Hollywood with the releases of ""John Malkovich"", ""The Matrix"" and ""Fight Club"".The film cleverly plays with the themes of identity, celebrity and the body/soul union. Is living for a moment as a famous person is worth it? Is it legitimate? And if it was really possible, would there be a real danger of ""playing"" with a person like the characters of the movie do? ""Being John Malkovich"" is an intellectual comedy drama unlike any other. And the first term is the most important of the three. With such a mix of surrealism and philosophy, it's definitely not a movie for the weak minds. You have to love these two things and complicated stories as well, or else you're gonna quit on this movie about halfway through.And the most controversial aspect of the film is the relationship between Maxine and Cameron Diaz as long as the events pass. There are moments that are gonna put some people away, if they are not instantly outraged and/or scandalized.With everything I've said about the movie, there's only one adequate way to describe it : it's a movie that takes chances. And this attitude gets rewarded by the viewers' admiration and amazement.I perfectly understand that it's not everybody who's gonna love ""Being John Malkovich"". But I believe that it's a movie that deserves to be watched. Not necessarily loved, but watched for sure. Because we have to salute the originality, the eccentricity and the vision of every artist involved into this project.""Being John Malkovich"" is one of the rare proofs that we can both stimulate our mind and our moralities by watching Hollywood actors. And this fact is enough for us to appreciate the movie as a whole.",Being John Malkovich

189,thesouthfamily2-552-707097,"""Meet you in Malkovich in one hour""",7,7 May 2014,"What an endlessly inventive movie this is! It supplies the audience a stream of dazzling inventions, twists and wicked paradoxes. Rare is the movie where the last half hour surprises you just as much as the first, and in ways you're not expecting. The movie has ideas enough for half a dozen films, but Jonze and his cast handle them so surely that we never feel hard- pressed; we're enchanted by one development after the next.Behind a filing cabinet on the 7 1/2th floor, Craig finds a small doorway. He crawls through it, and is whisked through some kind of temporal-spatial portal, ending up inside the brain of the actor John Malkovich. Here he stays for exactly 15 minutes, before falling from the sky next to the New Jersey Turnpike.Malkovich himself is part of the magic. He is not playing himself here, but a version of his public image—distant, quiet, droll, as if musing about things that happened long ago and were only mildly interesting at the time. It took some courage for him to take this role, but it would have taken more courage to turn it down.The movie just keeps getting better. I don't want to steal the surprises and punch lines. Even a Charlie Sheen cameo is inspired. At one point Malkovich enters himself through his own portal, which is kind of like being pulled down into the black hole of your own personality, and that trip results in one of the most peculiar single scenes I've ever seen in the movies. Every once in a long, long while a movie comes along that is like no other. A movie that creates a new world for us and uses it to produce wonderful things. It stakes out a completely new place and colonizes it with limitless imagination.",Being John Malkovich
190,fleagles,Definitely original and fun,8,19 January 2000,"Being John Malkovich is easily one of the most original films ever made. It's plot is twisted and difficult to explain; a financially failing puppeteer, Craig Schwartz (John Cusack), works on the 7 ½ (!) floor of a building filing papers and discovers a portal to the actor John Malkovich's brain.  His sexy, tempestuous co-worker played by Catherine Keener is along for the ride, and his wife (Cameron Diaz) is involved with both.  Then there is Schwartz's boss (Orson Bean) who also has a special interest in Malkovich.  The idea behind this film is brilliant, but the most fun of all comes from watching Malkovich himself endure this bizarre situation. The cast and the special effects are the two best features of this film, and Malkovich should win some type of award for being such a good sport. Unfortunately, the story sputters a little near the end, but for its originality and bizarreness , this is definitely worth seeing.  Spike Jonze has made his directing debut that will be remembered for a long time.",Being John Malkovich

193,kellyadmirer,An failed pastiche of music-less music videos,5,11 November 2001,"Spike Jonze is a famous music video director.  He is not a famous movie director.  ""Being John Malkovich"" illustrates why.There are too many mood shifts.  ""Malkovich"" has the feel of a sequence of independently crafted scenes strung together by someone who injected his differing mood into each.  Every few minutes, you get a completely different feel.  That is great in a sequence of music videos, where you have maybe 4 minutes to shock the audience with something that will make them remember a particular song, then move on to a completely new song with its own unique feel.  Fatboy Slim's ""Weapon of Choice,"" the Jonze video with a dancing Christopher Walken, was brilliant for that reason, creating an instant mood that cannot (as the video itself makes abundantly clear) be sustained after the song ends.  This movie has a scene that is almost a carbon copy of that dance routine (Malkovich dancing around his bedroom), but which leads nowhere, seems intended just to mix things up, and then just ends.  Thud. Ok, on to the next bizarre scene!  Just like in a music video.Another example is the Catherine Keener character.  She does a nice job with a classic independent-film style character.  First, she is presented as a prototypical man-killer.  Then, having shocked us with that, she becomes sexually ambiguous.  Shocking!  Then, she becomes a big seductress.  Oh boy! Then, she becomes a lesbian.  Outrageous!  Then she becomes....  It all feels disjointed.  Clever, but with inept character development and pacing for a serious film that can't decide whether it is a comedy or a drama or simply an MTV goof movie.The plot is simply weird.  There are indeed buildings in NYC with hidden floors, used by real estate barons and the like (I've been on one). Interesting use of a little-known fact.  The version in this film, though, is so off-the-wall that it becomes a distraction.  With high concept ideas like that, it seems at times like an extended ""Saturday Night Live"" skit. If you are going to do what turns into a sentimental drama, such obvious sight gags detract from the flow. I like SNL, but their sketches are best left on tv where they belong.The casting is eccentric.  I think John Cusack is miscast.  His image is simply too clean-cut to pull off the failing-puppeteer routine, and while he is supposed to play a weak character, that leaves a weak center to this film.  Cameron Diaz apparently wanted a change of pace from her glamour-girl comedienne roles, and she sure got that.  She does fine early on, when she is put in some droll situations, but falls down toward the end when the sentimentality starts in earnest.As for John Malkovich himself, you keep expecting him to just bust out and do something bold like, well, John Malkovich.  He almost pulls this off in the scene where he dons a baseball hat, confronts the people selling tickets to...him and gets into a knock-down fight.  That is the moment in the film that springs to life and makes you think that he might actually wind up doing something interesting.  Indeed, it leads into the film's cleverest scene.  But then we return to the Malkovich-as-zombie-controlled-by-others routine, and he loses focus.  You can virtually see the spark leave him, which is a fine acting job but a miserable detraction from the film.  If you have an exciting actor, why not turn him loose?  Let him fight against his predicament or something.  Instead, the script hamstrings him and makes him walk around in a virtual daze.Overall, an interesting failure.  And no, you cannot get from an office in midtown Manhattan to the NJ Turnpike in under 15 minutes.  Try it some time. Two stars out of four.",Being John Malkovich
194,Manthorpe,"Brilliant, and truly original.",9,12 January 2004,"A struggling puppeteer, Craig (Cusack), and his animal-obsessed wife (Diaz) become mesmerized by the discovery of a portal into the mind and body of John Malkovich, which is found in the office at Craig's new job. Craziness and weird situations ensue. Possible Spoilers herein: (but if I do, they won't be too revealing)This movie is another great example of how Spike Jonze and Charlie Kaufman can pump out some truly original films not typical of today's regurgitation-style film-making. I decided to watch this film after thoroughly enjoying Adaptation. Cusack and Diaz show off their acting skills in this movie, which was a surprise for me because I typically don't like the movies they both choose to be in. John Malkovich was cast perfectly as the host to which a portal to his mind exists. He's a weird guy, so it fits perfectly. The idea that there is a portal out there in which you can experience being someone else is truly awesome, and makes a great premise for a movie. I also like how the portal dumps it's occupants on the side of the road on the New Jersey turnpike when the ride is over. Kaufman seems to have a knack for making quirky but wholly original films and is why I can't wait for their next project. This movie has it all, comedy, romance, reality, fantasy and fun. The jokes in this movie are executed beautifully and made me laugh out loud several times. I love almost everything about this movie, the actors, the screenplay, the comedy and fantasy, and the ending. Ahhhh. Catherine Keener is also great in this film as Maxine, and man is she sexy! It was no surprise when both Craig and his wife wanted to get with her, and pined over her. I loved her character in the movie, even if she was an evil floozy.My only qualm with the movie was trying to figure out why all of those old people would want to go into Malkovich at once and share his mind and body. Personally, I'd rather just die. I think the movie could've done with them, but that's just me. Other than that, it's perfect. 9/10.",Being John Malkovich
195,krumski,A great premise squandered,6,19 February 2000,"I remember when I first heard the premise for this movie, I wanted to just get up and cheer - it sounded so great! A guy discovers a secret portal into the head of John Malkovich, allowing people to experience what it is like to be the famous (but not too famous) actor for 15 minutes at a clip, before being dumped out onto the New Jersey turnpike. Bizarre, surreal, and totally original. Which is why it's such a shame that the movie ends up using this device in service of a rather lame romantic triangle between John Cusack, Catherine Keener and Cameron Diaz, none of whom create a very interesting or likable character to begin with. The movie could have explored the nature of celebrity, or the psychological need people have to ""get inside"" someone else's head, or to live vicariously through others. All these things are touched on to some extent, but they take a backseat to what becomes essentially a boring sex romp.Still, there are some wonderful things here. The 7 1/2th floor is an invention of Monty Pythonesque lunacy, and it provides the film with a hilarious visual motif. The actual scenes of entering the portal and being inside Malkovich's head are shot with great deadpan brilliance. And Malkovich himself is totally amazing - wonderfully droll as ""himself"" and then suitably off the wall as his body becomes overtaken by forces beyond his control. He truly deserves the Oscar for Best Supporting Actor this year (just think how great the acceptance speech would be!)Of course, the fact that in a movie entitled ""Being John Malkovich,"" John Malkovich himself could be considered only a *supporting* actor is entirely the problem. I wanted more of him, and less of the dippy trio mentioned above. The movie frustrated me - it could have been so good, and settled for being ordinary. Ultimately, the things that are good about it do make it worth seeing, but just barely. And don't expect any comic masterpiece; all the critics that hailed it as such were talking about what the film could have been, not what it is. Rating: 6/10",Being John Malkovich

I like John Malkovich as an actor, and it sounded like a creative, fun way to go.  I looked for a fun, imaginative time.The Creative Forces, however, thought otherwise.  [Possible SPOILERS ahead.] They thought this would be a great time to create unlikable, amoral, vicious, clueless characters and have them carry the movie.  They thought themes of adultery, new forms of sexual perversion (just what we needed!), and constant sexual banter would be daring and risky and great cocktail-party fodder.Well, maybe it was for them, but it isn't for me.  I've never thought adultery was funny or interesting, and odds are excellent that I never will. And that was a central theme: married man pursues vicious, despicable woman... only to be joined in the pursuit by his wife.  Ho ho ho, how cutting-edge.

But then the surprises stopped coming. Instead, we see more and more odd and generally uninteresting events, concerning characters who are not likeable and whose motives are selfish and at times vague. The last hour of the movie I kept glancing at my watch, wondering when it would be over.Kudos to John Malkovich for being willing to play this role (though who wouldn't want a film with your name in it?). And I have to say I didn't even recognize Cameron Diaz. Cusack is fine, as is the actress who plays Maxine. But they are all characters who are hard to like or care about, and after you see the film's main hook there isn't much else to do except wait out the conclusion.I gave BJM a 5.",Being John Malkovich

John Cusack is Craig Schwartz, a straggly-haired, poverty-stricken puppeteer goaded by his animal-fixated wife (Cameron Diaz, almost unrecognisable under a gigantic brown wig) into getting a proper job, which he does, as a filing clerk on the seventh-and-a-half floor (a gag which really has to be seen) of a nondescript office building. It's here, while working for a dotty centenarian boss (Orson Bean) and lusting after colleague Maxine (Catherine Keener) that he stumbles upon the hidden portal that sucks unsuspecting parties straight into John Malkovich's brain, thus giving the person the opportunity to literally ""be"" John Malkovich for 15 minutes, before being spewed out beside the New Jersey turnpike. But what starts out as a money-spinning novelty quickly descends into insanity, as Diaz discovers the joys of the portal, Keener discovers the joys of Malkovich, and Malkovich slowly begins to twig that a bunch of complete strangers are messing with his head.The acting is brilliant in Being John Malkovich, Cusack has rarely been better and Diaz hasn't done anything this amusing or creative in a long time. But it's Catherine Keener and John Malkovich who stand out the most here, Keener's performance is wickedly enjoyable, she deserved her Oscar nomination. And Malkovich, who really needed to get that Academy Award nomination over Michael Caine, is amazing, he pulls off the most superb performance of his career, playing himself. Spike Jonze is also a man I look forward to seeing more from, his direction skills are ironically fascinating. Charlie Kaufman's writing deserves an Oscar and a Golden Globe, because he has written the most original story I have ever seen in a film.At the end of Being John Malkovich, you'll be sitting there with your jaw dropped open because this film is such a mindblowing, intelligent ride.

204,paul-nemecek,Being John Malkovich is a Wild Ride,9,3 July 2018,"This has been a great year for alternate realities at the movies. Films like The Matrix, Sixth Sense, Blair Witch Project, Thirteenth Floor, and Run, Lola, Run have all, in different ways, played with the line that separates past from present, reality from simulation, and truth from fiction. Being John Malkovich can be added to this list of innovative films that a recent issue of Entertainment Weekly described as the first films of the 21st century.There is little in this film that is formula. John Cusack plays a gifted puppeteer who aspires to be one of the world's great puppeteers. Unfortunately, there are not a lot of job openings for puppeteers so he is reduced to street theater where he is clearly underappreciated. An almost unrecognizable Cameron Diaz plays Cusack's wife, a pet lover who is just a little quirky. When Cusack decides to take a job as a file clerk on floor 7.5 of an office building, life becomes even weirder. Cusack discovers an opening behind a file cabinet, a little door that leads into a tunnel. Like the characters in C.S. Lewis's The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe, (or Alice Through the Looking Glass), Cusack jumps in and finds himself in an alternative universe. Instead of Narnia or Wonderland, Cusack finds himself on a 15-minute ride inside actor John Malkovich (played quite capably by . . . John Malkovich).Cusack joins forces with a co-worker to create a business. For $200 people can spend 15 minutes inside of John Malkovich's head, seeing the world through his eyes. Since this is even better than Real World or a WebCam show, people come in droves. Eventually, Malkovich himself discovers what's going on and jumps the line to go inside of his own mind. This leads to what has to be one of the more unique scenes in the history of film. 
The story takes on an even more interesting twist when Cusack finds a unique way to fulfill his lifelong dream of being the world's greatest puppeteer.This is one weird film--and I've left out some of the weird. This is also one of the most creative films I have seen, and the film raises interesting questions about consciousness, identity, love and meaning. There are great performances here by Cusack, Diaz, Malkovich, and Catherine Keener (Cusack's co-worker and eventual love interest). The real star of the show, however, is the story itself. First-time screenwriter Charlie Kaufman has crafted an interesting and innovative story. First-time director Spike Jonze handles the material extremely well. This is clearly not a film for all tastes, and the language and sexual scenes may well offend. This is, however, something that is very rare, in Hollywood--innovative, creative, and thought provoking. Watch for this film during the Oscar nominations. If this doesn't get nominated for screenplay--at least--I will hang up my trophy.",Being John Malkovich
205,kira02bit,"Just because you haven't seen its like before, does not make it great",1,17 December 2002,"A prime example of just because you have not seen anything like it before, does not make it a cinematic masterpiece.  Scuzzy puppeteer John Cusack and snide co-worker Catherine Keener discover a portal into the mind of actor John Malkovich (playing himself) in their bizarre office and decide to profit from it.  Marketed as a comedy, the film is inventive, most definitely original, but the laughs virtually dry up after the first 40 minutes.  The strange plot takes one bizarre turn after another, incorporating lesbianism, spousal abuse and cults into the mix.  Events become more and more sinister, disturbing and serious during the running time.  Unfortunately, the main characters, including an unrecognizable Cameron Diaz as Cusack's frumpy wife, are so odious that it becomes impossible to identify with them, and by the climax one really does not care what is done to whom.  Keener is initially terrific as the reprehensible profiteer, but she is given limited notes to play.  Malkovich may be a good sport, but he is a pretty dull character as envisioned here.  It is hard to recall Cusack ever being this unappealing.  Director Spike Jonze has definite potential, but his ambition spins out of control far too quickly on this project.  Even the look of the film, with everything in drab blues and greys, is a downer.  For all of the hype, the film is an amazingly empty experience.",Being John Malkovich

It will most likely only be a limited release unless it starts to make serious money, but for those in markets large enough, run to the theater.  This movie is the most original film of the year.  This premise, on initial description, sounds somewhat suspect.  A out of work puppeteer takes a filing job and finds a portal inside of John Malkovich's body where he can be John Malkovich for 15 minutes.  To explain anymore than that would be giving too much away.  The less known, the better.  The script is smart and funny and the inspired ensemble cast is brilliant.  The most winning aspect of this film is John Malkovich, for having the sense of humor to be cast as himself.

The movie was enjoyable though, fairly entertaining. It has an interesting plot: going through a tunnel in a building and on the other side you find yourself in the head of John Malcovich. It's a pretty good movie to watch. It has what one would want out of a comedy. It is much more imaginative than a lot of comedies. I just think the bizarre plot went a little too far towards the end. Catherine Keener was adequate, not great. (I thought she was actually better in Evan Almighty though Evan is not a better film) John Cusack was pretty good, he's done some better acting though. I didn't like Cameran Diaz very much in this movie. She is normally much better in everything else I have seen her in (The Holiday, In Her Shoes) John Malcovich definitely did the best acting. He was actually good in this movie as himself. This movie is a bit on the creepy side, the way people enter other people's minds like shopping malls.

209,nikxatz,Being Charlie Kaufman,9,25 May 2019,"""Being John Malcovitch"" is, in summary, a film about love, minds and puppets. Charlie Kaufman has proven once again, and this time mor than ever, that in order for a script to work it has to be an honest one, a script written by a person and a piece of art that illustrates that person's thoughts and emotions. I am amazed by the fact that with every movie he makes he shows a side of himself, a piece of his heart. His films are him and he is his films. As for this work...
It is a detailed, raw and (in a good way) dizzing illustration of what it means to ""be"", to exist, to be trapped in a body, your body, to want, to need, to ache, to crave for something and because of your misery to get it you become another to be pleased... BOOM! I mean every singe moment I think about his films a new thing pops up!
So, now I am going to tell you my view on this film. Anyone who just wans a brief review, you can skip the next paragraph and head to the others.
As I see it, the film revolves around the idea of puppets. Yes, puppets. It sounds rediculous right? Well. a puupet can mean a lot. When we handle a puupet, we become another,we live another life, we control our a life and seize it the way we want to. We feel grand and free. Being another gives us joy because another means another life with new an interesting things to live. We are bored of our failure and sadness and we all seek that ""other"". How many times have you imagined how life would be if you had more money or a better house or a more pretty face or fame? How many times have played theater alone and rehearse what you are going to say to sb or your future life? How often have your expectations of a ""happy ending"" to your day proved you wrong? And puupets mean even more. Everyone can be a puppet. A person can control a person and at the same time be controlled by another person and it goes on forever. We are never really free, are we? EVEN in the film industry. The cast is the puppets, the director pulls the stings and he might be controlled by the writer or the production company and it goes on...
So, in short I loved this film because this film IS its creator. It is his view, his idea on love, pain, relationships, desires, lonelyness. ""Being John Malkovich"" never feels like a selling product or a popcorny blockbuser made to make money and make people laugh. We get to grasp our inescapable lonelyness and the fact that we are all the same, suffering being that is born , lives a huge part of life in despair and constant sadness and dies. Its attention to detail, from the maticulusly crafted puppets to the short hillarious documentaries, its authentic performances (Malcovitch is shining in this one) and its HONEST direction and writing make this film a gem and an insight to the great Charlie Kaufman. If only I could be in his mind...WAIT A MIN-",Being John Malkovich

All of the rules in film-making are thrown overboard, and yet we're left not with a bunch of unstable rubbish but with a very satisfying final result. Acting is great. Notably Malkovich himself, and the unrecognisable Diaz is good as well. Some scenes are completely hilarious. I get the feeling that it's a string of comments on society rather than a coherent plot but somehow it all feels related. When i watched Jonze in an interview talking about it i couldn't gain any insight into this guy. He's totally nuts if you ask me, but he's still a brilliant filmmaker.",Being John Malkovich

I certainly didn't fall in love with it like most other commentors have.  Maybe if the atmosphere hadn't been so relentlessly dank and the characters a tad bit more likable, my emotions could have been gripped more, but as it was I just left the theater respecting the intelligence that went into it, grateful for a couple of decent laughs and knowing that I'll have basically forgotten it in a few hours.

Unusual story and very good acting throughout but a little slow - especially the first half of the movie. The problem is that not a great deal happens in the movie - and some of the interesting strands aren't developed (like the way that everyone kisses Malkovich's ass - but the shallowness of people is skimmed over). But definitely original. Good performances from the main players - and that woman (Catherine Keener) is an absolute stunner!

216,Jona1988,Great weird film!,8,9 February 2011,"Being John Malkovich is really a one in a kind, never seen anything quite like it. But there are many strange films out there and that a film is different doesn't necessarily make it a good one. Being John Malkovich is very strange but it is also just as good.The story is like completely insane but manages to keep getting more and more interesting the longer it goes. Never knowing what is to come next. The plot is exciting at all time but what I found a strong point was the characters. All the actors are great in creating characters as unpredictable as the rest of the movie. I feel there is no one that is really a good guy and neither a big bad one. Not a bad thing like many movies with characters one can't relate too, because here the roles have such substance an the interest for seeing what will happen and what move they make next keeps me on the edge of my seat at all time. Eventough this is a film that interest in all it's weirdness I feel that is more a character driven picture. John Cusack and Cameron Diaz are so greatly unpredictable, hard to fully get a hold of and Catherine Keener is really disturbing but in a good way for the film. John Malkovich himself is great in making himself feel even more awkward than the audience about what is going on, he is funny and one even comes to get some kind of bond to him. Brilliant dark comedy, it is funny and interesting in all it's weirdness and disturbing, sad and will somewhat mess with your head specially the psychological aspects delivered by the characters. Unlike many weird films Being John Malkovich manages to deliver much more than just awkwardness. Charlie Kaufman delivers a script unlike anything else and director Spike Jonze with amazing performances form the cast creates a completely unique film.

People desperate to spend 15 minutes in the consciousness of someone famous rather than endure their own assumingly bland existence, speaks volumes about lack of self knowledge and development. Just as desperate to escape a natural part of life: death and the mystery that it holds. Out of fear these people seem to be denying themselves the ultimate portal trip. The movie is more thought provoking than funny and I give it 7/10 for that. It pulls off some original scenes as well.

219,Doogie D,Interesting; pretty far from great,5,30 October 1999,"BEING JOHN MALKOVICH has an interesting premise with implications it follows unerringly.  It also has an unfortunate core of unpleasantness -- a cast of characters almost entirely with negative qualities, ranging from pathetic to evil -- which hurts quite a bit, I think.  I don't wonder that these folks would be desperate to shuck off their own personas for fifteen minutes, or that their own morality would allow them to exploit Malkovich; what would have been interesting is the idea of the decent person seduced by such an idea -- that might have led to a Hitcockian setup in which the hero is often ""punished"" for being bored and wishing something, anything, would happen. 
There are funny jokes and great touches here and there: Malkovich tries the portal himself to hilarious effect; Diaz's character bumping her head and she moves murderously through a doorway.  Overall, the movie is overrated probably because it succeeds in not being stupid, and there are genuine surprises.

I thought I had already reviewed it, but as I looked back over my reviews on IMDb, realized, I had been silent on my favorite dark comedy. A failure I must amend immediately.What made me think of this movie today is Catherine Keener in Get Out, the 2017 gem created by Jordan Peele, which I had to praise after watching it last night on HBO. I think it was a really smart choice for Peele to cast her. I will never forget her, since seeing her in Being John Malkovich. What I love about this movie is, well, everything--no, let me take away 1 star and give it 9, because as I recall, the ending did get a little too drawn out and overstayed its welcome. The ending did remind me of a lesson learned at UCLA Screenwriting taught by Professor Richard Walter, about beginnings and endings and when to exit the scene, and examples of sometimes when directors can't get off the stage. But it wasn't too bad, the ending, it didn't spoil the whole movie, it just went on beyond what felt like a good ending.As for the 9 stars I give it--everything, from the moment the story begins, drew me into this deliciously weird world, and it was as funny as it was mesmerizing! Every time I mention this movie to someone, I feel the urge to watch it again. And every time I have watched it again, I fall in love with its weirdness and humor all over again.

224,soymilk,John Malkovich is normal - the rest of this world is weird,10,21 November 2004,"Ah, poor John Malkovich. If you thought Truman Burbank had it rough in 'the Truman Show' with the entire world watching his every televised move, then your heart really has to go out to this guy. At the very least, Truman was always able to keep his inner mind sacred and untouched, but poor Malkovich doesn't even have that ability. He's stuck with all these depraved eccentrics, invading his privacy and making a huge pile of dollars at his expense, and he's completely powerless to stop them. That Malkovich is a real-life actor (he even played alongside Cusack before in 'Con Air'), living in this warped, fictional world makes it all the more haunting. It's hard not to come away from this one feeling just a little unnerved  the concept it revolves around is, after all, undeniably grotesque, riddled with plot points which are just plain absurd, and which the characters themselves (except for Malkovich) accept all too readily (for example, why would you be spat out by the side of the New Jersey turnpike of all places?), and the final outcome of their escapade is outrageously creepy and harrowing to say the least - but paradoxically the film is also fun, hilarious and really has its charm.And that, I suppose, is the beauty of BJM - no logic, no ethics, no philosophy (Craig does briefly deliberate on the philosophical implications of his discovery, but is persuaded by Maxine to brush them aside pretty quickly in favour of cashing in on it); just loads of twisted surrealism and great laughs, and a movie so delightfully INSANE that it boggles the mind. There could be a little message somewhere in there about the worldliness of modern society and our materialistic drive to make money out of whatever we can, our human fascination with celebrities and beliefs that their lives are more fulfilling than our own, and, in the case of the oddball old Dr. Lester, refusal to face up to our own mortality, but even there everything is skewered as further dark comedy. The 'morals' of the story are almost a joke, but darn good ones at that, and for best results you really have to detach your mind beforehand, sit back and just enjoy this for being the lavish and crazy piece of farce it invariably is. It's daring, imaginative and wonderfully unconventional, and comes complete with some of the most memorable characterisations of the late 90s (the deep eccentricity of some the characters may cause them to seem a little distant at first, but they do grow on you, and I know that anyone can identify with the dejected puppeteer Craig Schwartz and his struggle for recognition on some level). Granted, a film about a group of people who discover a portal leading into an actor's brain was hardly going to be everyone's cup of Kenco, and I don't anticipate that everyone who sees it will share my enthusiasm, but for those of us who like our movies to be just that bit different, this is a psychotic little masterpiece to be savoured.After all, it's impossible to deny the appeal of a movie where most of the human characters are acting essentially like instinct-driven animals, concerned primarily with self-survival and/or attracting a mate, contrasting with a subplot which concerns a young chimpanzee gradually learning to come to terms with his repressed childhood trauma. Throw in some of the most brilliantly-timed cameo appearances from Sean Penn and Brad Pitt ever captured on film and you know you have a winner on your hands.

Maybe so, but should film be about dictating what life IS or what life could be?I honestly have no pity nor sympathy for any of the characters in this film, perhaps not even Malkovich himself as he falls for the manipulative witch played by Keener.  It is a puppet show of dark humour, and we the unsuspecting children are engaged to watch it.The ending truly is the final straw, being absolutely disgusting. 
Let's face it, though.  It is popular to tell society that we are all perverted at heart, in some form or another.  Most of us already know this fact.

226,andrew7,"Clever, Original, but Slight",8,12 February 2002,"""Being John Malkovich"" is a film with a wonderfully creative, refreshingly original concept, but burdened with one-dimensional characters and a very flimsy plot.  You know what though?  It doesn't matter.  The concept is so good that it's enough by itself.  The only really serious criticism I have of the film is that, on repeated viewings, the minor weaknesses reveal themselves more fully, but this seems like such a small, petty complaint to level at such a fresh, inventive film. So, is it just a gimmick movie?  Well, yeah, it really is.  But the gimmick is executed with some real flair.  What saves this from being just some minor art house curiosity is primarily the work of two people: John Malkovich (whose performance in this film has been criminally underappreciated) and Charlie Kaufman, who wrote the script. 
What allows ""Being John Malkovich"" to succeed as it does is the continuity of the characters, even as they go about inhabiting various bodies.  Thus, even though John Cusack disappears for a large stretch of the film, his character, Craig Schwartz, is in it from beginning to end.  This is a very difficult feat, and the script deserves a lot of credit.  But Malkovich, in particular, deserves the credit, for undertaking the performance of three very distinct characters in this film.  Now, giving a single performer multiple roles is not a such a big deal.  But in this film, Malkovich had to take over characters from other actors and continue them.  When Schwartz finally takes over Malkovich, that's the last we see of Cusack for a considerable time.  But Schwartz is still there.  Same again when Dr. Lester (or, if you prefer, Captain Mertin) takes over.  Continuity is kept with the previous actors and their respective performances.  This is so crucial to make this film work, and the both scriptwriter and the actor deserve credit both for appreciating the importance, and actually making it work. 
So, sit back and enjoy this truly inventive, clever, and original film. Just don't think about it too hard.  Don't worry about the mechanics of Lester taking people with him.  Don't worry about the utter arbitrariness of Craig's infatuation with Maxine.  Don't worry about the even more arbitrary pairing of Lotte and Maxine.  Don't worry about how Maxine could possibly know whether the child was Lotte's or Craig's.  Don't worry about the odd coincidence of Emily (the new vessel) being the daughter of Malkovich (the old vessel), and don't worry about how Lester knew this, or knew anything else about the portal, or where the portal was before the Mertin Flemmer Building was built. If you want to be a stick in the mud, these are legitimate questions.  But it just spoils the fun.  And in a film as fun as this, that's a truly terrible thing to do.",Being John Malkovich

My girlfriend laughed like a drain, but I just sat open-jawed all the way through. What are we supposed to make of it? Does it matter? Jonze himself, when pressed on the film's meaning, shrugs and says ""I dunno"". Perhaps that's a good thing. BJM needs to stand on its own, without even the influence of its creator. Creator? Was this 'thing' created? Or did it just appear from some other dimension, warped into our own by some peculiar combination of cosmic elements? This sounds like a negative review, but I loved it.

228,bhicks56,could this be the best film of 1999?,10,27 November 1999,"Arguably, I think it is. Though everyone is probably going to sniff at the absurdity and cynicism of BEING JOHN MALKOVICH, you have to agree that you have never seen anything like it. Not even close.This story is mostly about manipulation and identity crisis and it has so much symbolism of that. John Cusack is a puppeteer, a VERY skilled one at that, who likes the creations that dangle from strings under his fingers. He is the starving and depressed artist of his craft, and has his puppets, which represent real people in his life, carry out his emotions and fantasies.Even the use of John Malkovich, an excellent character actor, seems to be a perfect choice in this movie of being someone else, if even for 15 minutes (of fame perhaps?). I truly believe John Malkovich deserves an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor, not only for his magnificent performance, but for having the guts of playing himself and revealing a twisted, if fictional, subconscience. One of the funniest jokes in the film is that no one knows what movie he's been in! (""I loved you in that jewel thief movie!"")Charlie Kaufman deserves some kind of award for his ingenious script. Spike Jonze puts Kaufman's vision on film with such visual pizazz. Umm, I'm coming short of intelligent words to define this film. Just see it, because everyone shines, every sight gag is hysterical, the wacky AND witty dialogue is sweet music to the ears, this movie is phenomonal.It's been getting as much raves and hype(?) as THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT, but unlike that cinematic ripoff, this movie certainly deserves it.

Not a bad idea, but tails off into navel-gazing and with no sense of direction or ending.Weird does not equate to worthwhile.I bought the DVD because I'd seen a small bit of the movie on TV, and thought it looked interesting. However:The extra on the DVD - the ""interview"" with the so-called director - says it all.

John Cusack did a good job, Cameron Diaz did a good job, Catherine Keener did a good job and John Malkovich did a good job. This is one of the best movies of 1999. American Beauty beats this movie. This movie is so imaginative. This movie got nominated for 3 Oscars: Best Director - Spike Jonze, Best Original Screenplay and Best Supporting Actress. I could not hardly realize that was Cameron Diaz. John Cusack was hard to recognize too. This movie had great acting, directing, cinematography, sets and script. This is unlike any movie I have ever seen before. I do not know why everybody hates this movie.

232,silviopellerani,Superb atmospheres. Do you want the immortality? See the film,7,31 July 2000,"Lilliputian and dreamy atmospheres introduce the spectator into the marionettes world of Craig (John Cusack). Meanwhile the story gets complex and the dream to manage people like puppets is confirmed for a moment. The incapacity of communication is filtered and overcome by misusing somebody else's body. It has reminded me, in a different way, the very essential message of ""Cyrano de Bergerac"". Having found a tunnel, a passage, which ferries into the head of John Malkovich gives an immediate benefit to succeed in love with the woman of your dreams. But this passage could be also used, with a sort of sexual ambiguity, by the wife-Lotte (Cameron Diaz), misusing once again John Malkovich's body. The wrong ferrying process could bring to very disappointing effects: like being trapped in an undesired body or searching into the private unconscious of John Malkovich. But the very essential of this brilliant, and very original film is how to get the immortality using, by time to time, a different ""body container"". John Malkovich is majestic, Spize Jonze has done a demential and absurd but original and clever superb film. At the end the only question to ask is: are all of us puppets or puppeteer?

I can think of a lot worse movies, but this one was pretty awful. The beginning was all right, and drew me in with the ludicrous tunnel idea. The people lining up to pay $200 to enter the tunnel were pretty funny, as was the cash box - like a carnival ride. But for the last hour the lightness disappears. The film turns vicious, preachy and mechanical. Malkovich and Cusack become villainous white males, and are set up like wooden puppets to take a predictable feminist hit. On top of this, a subplot involving living forever by invading another person's mind kicks in. Mind travel as a carnival ride is exhilarating - mind travel as a way to live forever is a cheesy science fiction/philosophy lecture. What started out as an innovative film ended up pretty flat. It's heartening to see that it didn't receive any Academy awards.I guess it was worth the $1, just to satisfy my curiosity. It won't be staying around here for another viewing, though.

238,Joel I,A classic fantasy,9,11 November 1999,"In the great tradition of ""Alice in Wonderland"" and ""Eraserhead,"" comes ""Being John Malkovich,"" Spike Jonze's totally original and captivating fantasy.  The movie's originality is especially welcome in a time when almost every film to come out of Hollywood is either a sequel, a remake, or a knock-off.  John Cusack is Craig Schwartz, an unemployed puppeteer who gets a job as a file clerk in a strange office with low ceilings on the 7-1/2th floor (Harry Potter fans will be reminded of Platform 9-3/4).  It is here that he discovers a portal that sucks you into the head of John Malkovich for exactly 15 minutes (a nod to Andy Warhol) and then dumps you beside the New Jersey Turnpike.  All this has to be seen to be grasped --- and it's just for starters!  The film never runs out of surprises.  The fact that writer Charlie Kaufman could have thought up a story like this is only half as amazing as the fact that it could be successfully brought to the screen.  Jonze deserves an Oscar nod.  The movie has more ideas on its mind than it can tackle (little things like celebrity, identity, consciousness, sex, and death), but never mind -- it is amazing and hilarious the whole way.  John Malkovich also deserves an Oscar for accepting such a risky role and for doing it so brilliantly.  It will be the first time an actor is nominated for portraying himself!",Being John Malkovich

It reminded me of a live action Wallace and Grommit cartoon, which also seem blissfully unfettered by reality when constructing a story line.  Cusak has always been one of my favorite actors, and he is great here.  Cameron Diaz once again proves she's more than just a pretty face (and great body and terrific legs), and, well John Malkovich deserves a Supporting Actor nomination.  The only annoying thing is that Catherine Keener is one of those actresses who doesn't mind nude scenes as long as she's not exactly naked, so you have a couple of Austin Power type scenes where she's covered by absurdly strategically placed sheets or pillows.

The screenplay should have won more awards. what a film, and I am not even into these kinds of films but good work is good work regardless of your personal genre choice.

There are some ideas all in a row, like, for example, the offices in which you can only walk bent(could work out, really, in some futuristic drama, or in Alice in Wonderland the third Sequel, but it does not here), the doorway to another person's life (although much harder to believe, but it could still work out somewhere, some place, it does not here), from which passageway you are dumped to a ditch after 15 minutes besides a motorway (sounds quite appealing, right?).

It all seemed to be a bit too surreal and too far fetched.  It almost seemed to me that everybody was trying too hard at their character.I do not think the storyline was bad.

You can't help but wonder how the idea for the movie came about. I'm betting alcohol was involved. Probably drugs, too.The plot revolves around what happens when one of the characters discovers a portal into the head of John Malkovich, the actor. You crawl through this door, enter into this long tunnel and all of a sudden you're in John Malkovich's head where you're seeing and experiencing everything that he is at that moment in time. The experience is apparently quite thrilling so before long a business is set up and everyone is doing it, including the famous actor himself.The movie gets high marks for its originality and dark humour. It also features one of the most twisted love triangles that I've ever seen.On the downside, the story loses focus at times and even drags in places. Overall though, it's a funny and enjoyable film, even if it is a little bit bizarre.

I also liked floor 7.5 and its inhabitants and the access to the Malkovich mind is engrossing at first.  But then the plot development seems to lose its way.  Surely there is a better way to tie up this plot than the one chosen! The characters are generally interesting, except for that of the wife.

For the best viewing experience, it is best to know NOTHING about the movie at all.)This movie, along with having maybe THE best and most daring and original plot in the history of Hollywood movies, also has wonderful, colourful human interaction. All the characters - and I mean ALL - are glaringly dysfunctional, but they are this in such a way that their defects 'click' together to produce some of the great dialogues in cinema. The point where Craig tries to explain Maxine about just having been inside John Malkovich's head is just incredible in its simplicity and effectiveness. The interplay between Craig and Lotte is also crackling. This movie also contains one of the weirdest love interests ever - between a quasi-lesbian, domineering woman who is turned on by a woman inside a man's body, and a bored housewife who experiences the thrill of being inside John Malkovich and decides she's a transsexual. Thus, lines like 'I have to see you, Maxine.' - 'Ok, Lotte, I'll see you in Malkovich in an hour' are born. Wonderful, wonderful movie.

All I know is that I had a smile on my face all through it.The acting was amazing and I think that John Cusack should be nominated for an Academy award for Best Actor and Catherine Keener for Best Supporting Actress.  Cameron Diaz was also great and Orson Bean was a delight as Dr. Lester.  The stage is set for absurdity from the very beginning when John Cusack has to apply for a job on Floor 7 1/2 and the image of all the employees walking around all hunched over because the ceiling is so low still makes me chuckle.  The story is so strange that you just have to accept it for the fantasy that it is, go through the little door and shoot down the tube for the ride.

Catherine Keener and John Malkovich were the only ones who knew how to act in this movie. Throughout the entire movie Catherine was literally the only one who smiled or even projected a positive vibe. Of course John Malkovich was entertaining in his own way however the movie was sooo lacking in other areas and slow moving despite a couple interesting scenes that they failed to capitalize on.

I was especially depressed at how one user commented that Malkovich's performance in ""Con Air"" was superior to his performance in THIS film.

It is a well written, well acted black comedy with tremendous performances by Cameron Diaz (you won't even recognize her), John Cusack, the excellent Catherine Keener and of course John Malkovich.  The movie reminded me of something Monty Python would have done. It is a ridiculous notion that you can enter someone's head for 15 minutes at a time, but early on in the movie you just come to accept this and appreciate this.

True, it is a comedy that bends the lines between genders and species. It plays havoc with the truths of existence and the sanctity of the human soul. It even bends the mortality of man into something like practical incarnation, yet it's funny.Disturbing yet hilarious. What WOULD happen if someone could enter a portal into their own head? The answer the movie provides is both gut-wrenchingly funny and bizarre.

So none of them scored to their max.And is it original? Somehow I remembered the 'brainstorm' that came in the late eighties. Brainstorm was a sci-fi but dwelt into the story line idea. Same point-of-view shots. And brainstorm thrilled me at the end with a philosophical touch into the nothing.When Craig explains about the John Malkovich portal to keener I thought there the story would go into the deeper dive. But it just afloat-ed with men and women living for centuries would still constantly linger for sex as like that of teenagers.The John Malkovich-turned-top-puppeteer part documentary was a nice piece and the induction part. About the casting: John Cusack and Cameron Diaz were unrecognizable transformations into perfect roles of the story.At the beginning of the story there was a dialog by Craig 'consciousness is a curse..'.

I found some of the characters reactions to things to be extremely unrealistic and absurd. i was constantly aware of the fact that i was watching a film and that can be very distracting! i thought that things were overblown and extremely exaggerated in every way. The reason why i gave it 3/10 instead of 1/10 is because it was a unique idea but it was poorly executed and could have been done better. It is the weirdest film i have ever seen and i have seen a lot of films! i have seen about 600 now! I regret watching it and i expected more from Cameron diaz and john cusack. the acting was also bad but that could be contributed to the poor writing not the actors fault.

This is certainly a good movie, but I don't consider it to be a true classic.First of all, it drags on far too long. In particular, the beginning scenes prior to the discovery of the portal are almost painfully overextended and barely held my interest. The dialogue was also very stilted at times. After Craig first visits the portal he figures out far too much about it too quickly. The characters also discuss the philosophical ramifications of the portal in a very ham-handed way. In both cases it seemed that Kaufman felt viewers wouldn't understand the visual symbolism and needed the ideas spelled out in detail (although he may have just been poking fun at film critics). Some of the scenes are visionary and hilarious (Craig's puppet shows, Malkovich entering his own brain, the trip through his subconscious) but many others fall flat. The result is a mixed bag. The saving grace is the brilliant performance by Malkovich himself. His good natured self-deprecation and his ability to play several wildly different characters make the movie work. I was also impressed with Cameron Diaz, who proved that when freed from the constraints of beauty and bad scripts, she can be a good actress. I was not as impressed with Catherine Keener as most critics were-- her part was well-written, but she wasn't terribly convincing. In the end, this is a good (7/10) movie that gets an extra point for its spectacular creativity. Spike Jonze shows the potential to be a truly great director. But he isn't quite there yet.",Being John Malkovich
266,cathcacr,"Cute, zany, absurd, and fun . . . but deep? Uh, no.",6,1 May 2002,"I had seen this one about a couple years back.  My recollection of it was that it was a fun, witty, pretty original comedy, but not especially deep, moving, or inventive.  I do have to think that if this is what passes for deep and challenging (or even ""BRILLIANT!""), audiences may really be that dumbed down.  If you're interested in the philosophical questions this raised (and I say this as a student of philosophy), then go delve into the relevant philosophical texts and you'll find out how superficial a treatment of the subject this is.  The most poignant philosophical question involved is whether one person could *be* another.  Does John Malkovich really exist any more as the person he was once a Craig Schwartz takes over?  The answer is: Craig Schwartz was being Craig Schwartz, using (what was previously) John Malkovich's body. John M.'s identity is effectively annihilated.  And then . . . what?  It does raise some serious questions, but the movie didn't point toward any answer because it would have ruined the comic effect of it all.  It's not intended to make sense, obviously, but the effect of this, in this movie anyway, isn't intellectual but comic -- that is, because it doesn't really bring any intellectual tools to answer or even really address any of these hard questions.  See it as a zany, absurd, light-weird comedy, not as some intellectually engaging masterpiece.  It just doesn't deserve to be taken that seriously, and the film's authors seem to agree.That was my original opinion of the movie, and my second viewing of it in the last couple days left my opinion virtually unchanged.This site's database tells me that I had registered a vote of 6/10 for this movie.  (For me, I try grading on a real curve, so a 6/10 is above-average.) My second viewing of it led me to think either a 6 or a 7 out of 10, and seeing as my previous rating is a 6, my heart isn't in raising it to a 7. 6.5 out of 10 if half-points apply.One of the more overrated movies on the site, but it seems to have been slowly sliding downward, and rightfully so -- like a number of other overrated flicks from 1999, I might add.

267,dover,A good movie with a great concept.,10,6 November 1999,"This is an inspired, twisted movie.  The much-talked about concept, where actors actually go inside John Malkovich, is an excellent twist, but would not have worked were the plot and acting not so good in themselves.In truth, Malkovich is a catalyst for the plot.  A weird love triangle occurs between John Cusack, Catherine Keener, and Cameron Diaz.  Instead of the average movie with such a premise, where the actors pretty much spend an hour and  a half lamenting their situation, the three of them act upon their instincts using a portal in Cusack's office they find that takes you into Malkovich's head.The wonderful thing about this movie is that it doesn't take itself too seriously.   While there is real emotion and tension throughout the movie, it's mixed in with the weirdness of the whole situation, and ends up with a very good balance between the comedic aspects of being able to go inside someone's mind, and the feeling the characters have for each other.A word about the acting: Everyone is good.  Cusack and Bean play straightmen of sorts, and are very good at it.  Cameron Diaz tries to shed her beauty glow, and it almost works, though at times she tries to hard to seem downbeat.  There are two excellent performances: One is Catherine Keener, as the vixen who enchants everyone she meets.  She plays the part with a real sexual energy you don't often see. And...John Malkovich is great.  He really plays three characters, and plays them all expertly.  He is really a comic relief of sorts in this story.  He allows the movie to poke all kinds of fun at him, and his performance is great.  Better than the one where he play a jewel thief. (if that doesn't makes sense, see the movie).All in all, this movie is a real departure from the usual Hollywood drivel. I highly recommend it.",Being John Malkovich

And all the strange situations Alice got into, like rooms with low ceilings? But this film lacks the charm of the literary classic written in the 19th century. In fact, it is a deplorable mess. I am a Malkovich fan. He has done some of the finest work in theatre and film of the late 20th and early 21st centuries. But this is a major misstep. The puppets (really marionettes) with all their actions being controlled by someone else pulling the strings are supposed to be some sort of analogy for what happens to the real people--with someone else yanking them around.

He's only in it for about 1/3 of the time, but during that time I get a reminder of what a great talent really is, even if he is full of himself, with his periwinkle bathmat, LOL.

271,Cel_Stacker,P.T. Barnum was right...,4,4 December 2005,"...and I wouldn't be surprised to find that Spike Jonze is a relative.Let's make it quick--a milquetoast puppeteer (Cusack), his wildly environmentalist wife (Diaz), and his opportunistic co-worker (Keener) discover a portal which leads from the ""13""th floor of an office building into the conscious of actor John Malkovich. It becomes a great way to make some quick cash, until the actor himself finds out and the true purpose of the portal is revealed.Granted--the film is definitely unique, and is a scathing, honest comment on America's overdone obsession with celebrity. Unfortunately, it has no staying power in the area of cinema. So many celebrities--and critics with celebrities for friends--sang it's praises so loudly that it came to mean nothing to those of us who aren't celebrity, thus the mission failed. The story pushes the point a little too hard, and there are almost no characters to like. Most heartbreaking is the character Orson Bean plays--having been used to him playing a cornucopia of charming characters, I was saddened to see him reduced to the role of a wacky, twisted cult-leader. I would not see this film again.Ironically, the only reason to see this contrivance is Malkovich himself. He firmly steals the show from the climax to the very end. After this film, I gained new respect for him as an actor. I guess it wasn't a total loss--okay, okay, one more star, but that's it!",Being John Malkovich
272,DavidPumpkins,There's few films like this one...,9,17 December 2000,"At last, an interesting story comes from Hollywood, with the added bonus of being the most original for a good long while. ""Being John Malkovich"" tells the story of puppeteer Craig Schwartz (the impeccable John Cusack) who discovers a tiny portal behind a filing cabinet at his new workplace which takes him on an amazing journey inside the head of John Malkovich, star of such films as ""Empire of the Sun"" (1987) and ""Con Air"" (1997).  Exactly why it is Malkovich is anyone's guest, but Craig decides to share the experience with his girlfriend Lotte (Cameron Diaz looking totally unrecognisable) and sour work colleague Maxine (Catherine Keener).  The latter hits upon the notion that there could be money in this discovery for herself and Craig and they set up their own business taking people inside the head of John Malkovich who, for a while at least, is unaware of what is going on inside his head.   Darkly humourous and ultimately quite touching, ""Being John Malkovich"" is one of the must-see films of 1999, and one you are unlikely to forget.

John Cusack is excellent in this film, as is John Malkovich himself.  After all, nobody but Malkovich could pull this film off to begin with.  Cameron Diaz is all but unrecognizable in her portrayal of Lotte Schwartz, but her performance here is only ho-hum.  I have learned not to expect much from her in anything but a comedy film anyways, especially after seeing Something About Mary.I recommend this film to those who want to see something fresh, and who enjoy movies that call for some thought.  I don't believe a story such as this has ever been tried before, and that makes the film more appealing.  I passed by it for a few weeks at the video store before committing to it, and now I'm glad I watched it.The premise is pretty simple.  While at work one day on the 7 1/2 floor, Craig Schwartz (John Cusack), who is a puppeteer, finds a small door which allows him to enter the mind of John Malkovich and see through his eyes for a short period of time, and then be dumped out beside the New Jersey turnpike.  As word of this spreads, various hijinks and interpersonal relations are played out amongst the characters in the film.

The scene (stop reading now if you don't want it spoiled) where Malkovitch enters his own subconcious was ... weirdly interesting.

Don't be mislead, this is a VERY funny film, but it's also quite dramatic, full of fascinating complexity and beautiful imagery.  From Craig's dialog's through his puppet's, the visions and feelings experianced through Malkovich, the (in the very literal sense) low-ceiling workplace, the absolutely priceless chase through Malkovich's subconscious, it all comes together with a very sad, strange, and appropriate ending to create a work of art.

A very well written screenplay in which the information is passed onto us through different characters in different ways. Meaning: We know exactly as much as the protagonist, we know more the some characters and we certainly know way less then someone else. This brings me to the editing, which is good for it's purpose. It get's the story running, never makes you feel bored and has a good rhythm as well as some pretty interesting cuts.I would say the directors choice of using two different visual styles, depending on who he focused, makes the story much more understandable as well as funny, some, but far from being really innovative, the screenplay, again makes it so different.Acting wise great.

300,Pelagia,The Frayed Ends of Sanity,10,12 May 2000,"This movie is so absurd and so way out there that it will be either hated or loved, there cannot be an in-between.  In one of his reviews, Roger Ebert noted that many films nowadays display for the viewer some sort of new novelty that will shock or amaze  (think of the 'zipper' scene in ""...something about Mary"") the audience.  ""Being John Malkovich"" is an experience that takes this premise to a whole new level.I noticed that the film borrows many themes and ideas from Terry Gilliam's film ""Brazil"".  Most interesting to me was the feeling that the director wanted you to fall in love with a particular character, only to twist the story and make you hate them.  In the beginning, I sympathized with Craig, the stereotypical loser with a soft side for art, who later turns out to be a greedy jerk.  Then there was his neglected, unattractive wife Lotte, whose personality is revealed to be nothing more than sex-driven and stabs her husband's back.  So goes the movie, as it was in Brazil, when every character is later revealed to have an obnoxious, repelling side that drives us to another character to seek comfort in, perhaps to put our faith into as the protagonist that will lead us through the film.Honestly, the beginning led me to believe that Craig would undergo some transformation that would fulfill his dreams, make him a winner.  Having this bubble bursted was somehow disconcerting, uncomfortable, yet utterly ingenious.The movie is mad, it runs at a frenetic pace, with very strange logic.  Much of it seems deja vu, as if I've seen it somewhere else before... yet it is done so well it comes off as original, brilliant.   And it is.10 out of 10.",Being John Malkovich

I came to ""Being JM"" after ""Eternal sunshine of a spotless mind"" and again found with pleasure craziness and inventiveness in great abundance.Being JM won the Saturn Award for the Best Fantasy Film from the Academy of Science Fiction, Fantasy & Horror Films, whereas Eternal Sunshine was nominated by the same for the best Science Fiction Film. Very well, because this means there is coherence and a kind of signature from an author.Said that I loved the genius spread all around the film, I must also say that I'd have been happier if such a brilliant idea of the vessel had been used to develop something more than just a ""comedy"":John Malkovich: You see, Maxine, it isn't just playing with dolls.Maxine: You're right, my darling, it's so much more. It's playing with people!I mean: from these very lines we can appreciate how differently and dramatically the film could evolve. In a sense, although as I said I enjoyed the movie, I also had the impression of a big waste of talent. In Eternal Sunshine such a talent was used to develop a wonderful love story, and this is why I think that Kaufman has really grown a lot after Being JM.",Being John Malkovich
302,The Truth,"Great idea, but misguided.",7,4 April 2000,"I went to see Being John Malkovich with high expectations, but came out of the theater somewhat let down. The film has a great premise, good actors and it's full of original ideas and intelligent twists. Even bigger the disappointment, when after the first half the film loses it's thematic integrity, turning into a conceptual merry-go-round without a proper focus on anything.As said before, the first half of Being John Malkovich is ingenious. Although based on an extxraordinary idea, the film doesn't just play with it, but instead uses it to explore themes such as identity, manipulation and celebrity. Strangely, much of this is thrown into the trashcan after we hear the explanation why there is a portal into Malkovich's mind (in my opinion, there was no need for explanation, and the one given was stupid and incoherent). After that the film is nothing more than a battle of who controls John Malkovich; it suffers the fate it kept avoiding for it's first half. The last 30 minutes of the film are nothing more than an intellectual masturbation with no direction nor deeper meaning. The ending, albeit strange, is unsatisfying and does little to save the movie.A minor letdown is John Cusack. His literary lines and over-the-top acting would work well if Being John Malkovich were just a comedy. But when he tries to play the tragic character and display inner conflicts he simply isn't credible. This is hardly Cusack's fault, though; the dialogue, the characters and their emotional reactions are not crafted in a believable way (the only exception being John Malkovich himself). Whether this is deliberate or not, it ruins much of the films dramatic tension.Despite all this criticism I still kind of liked Being John Malkovich, mainly for its clever themes and original way of approaching them. If American cinema is going into this direction, I'm not complaining.Rating: **½ (out of ****)",Being John Malkovich
303,from_christmas_past,Creativity masks glaring flaws,6,6 August 2008,"Completely original, but blatantly violating the basic laws of film making, 'Being John Malkovich is a movie that invites you to laugh at its absurdity. i have no complaints with the plot. In fact, it comes along as refreshing and arouses anticipation of anyone who bothers to read the movie synopsis before watching a film. A surreal concept, which a portal to someone's brain is, requires that similar treatment in the movie. Yet, the portal is almost dismissed in the movie as being nothing more than commonplace and mundane. To see the director overlooking the essence of fantasy and instead weave a story on its fringe is sad because as viewers you are left salivating for the meaty substance that never comes. The acting is mediocre, and the scenes are patched together many times instead of a coherent narrative. The film expects to sell on novelty, but so many of natural consequences arising from an imaginative plot. The film is humorous at times, but overall feels like the director felt like he had a great idea and decided to sell that instead of making a film around it.",Being John Malkovich
304,tangietangerine,"""I have seen a world that NO man should see!""",8,28 June 2014,"My second viewing of this film revealed a depth I had not noticed in the first time around. The movie officially is filed under the comedy label, and it certainly does seem so, if we remember the scene where Malkovich enters his own portal or the dark bits of humor regarding Schwartz unfortunate life, but it actually goes a long way over to explore the obscurities of one's subconscious mind. I've been a long time fan of Charlie Kaufman's fantastic creativity and talent to put together the most fantastic and strange stories. He had me at Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, and it's hard not to remember Joel & Clementine looking for a safe place to hide from the ""eraser guys"", as we watch people come and go in and out of John Malkovich's mind and its layers. That Kaufman picked him to be the protagonist is curious, as he's not a particular Hollywood A-List and one could even say, very random...but I guess that is part of the bittersweet humor of the story, too.Cameron Diaz was barely recognizable, and I think it's great that so many good actors are a part of this, I guess it's a script - and an opportunity to do something different, that only comes along every now and then. At times, the humor exceeds the ""tragic but funny"" line and becomes just tragic, like the memories we find visiting Malkovich's mind or the scene where Schwartz ties up Lotte and keeps her in the cage in order to be with Maxine. Everyone seems to be unhappy with their place in life and trying desperately to move on, but in the move they end up being hurt and mislead by each other...funny thing is that John Malkovich's head should be the catalyst for them to do so.I confess I'm not very fond of the ""alien"" masterminding subplot behind the portal's origin, because it's just too weird! But what in this movie isn't? I guess that was better than the portal remaining unexplained, so I try to pass it over and look at the innovative project it is.",Being John Malkovich
305,glennsmithk,One of the most overrated films in history.,3,3 November 2019,"There's not a lot of middle ground in the reviews here. It's likely because Malkovich's sycophants are running up the score, and the counter reaction is to low ball it. We heard it all. It's creative. It's artsy. Yeah, yeah. Well, it also has an adequate cast and production team. However, it's failure is that it's banal, tedious, and foolish. Add to that the self-promoting hubris of a plot centered on a real actor rather than a character portraying an actor, and one winds up with this overcooked mess. This film has lost most of its feigned luster over the past 20 years. It's not a classic. It never will be. It was an overrated flash in the pan for passing generation.",Being John Malkovich
306,joesiegel,We are lucky to have a screenwriter like Charlie Kaufman among us.,10,23 February 2020,"This is the kind of movies that I have been looking for all my life, a metaphysical, surreal and philosophical journey that explores different issues of human nature, this film has docile dyes of comedy, but has all the potential of being a dark and grotesque thriller, nevertheless that is what gives the touch of originality to this film released in 1999, that year all the films wanted to look like Seven, the theaters were mined of dark thrillers, both good and ridiculous, Being John Malkovich does not need to be dark and Grotesque to talk about complex and deep issues.The story is so difficult to explain with words that I'm going to skip that part of the reviews and go straight to the point, Being John Malkovich is about of people's desire to be someone else, the feeling of not feeling comfortable with them himself and this film portrays a society that does not feel comfortable in their bodies, a society in search of satisfaction that cannot be achieved by being themselves, people who need attention, most of us want to be a movie star or at least live a life so.The central issue of the film is the loss of identity of people, we realize in a moment of the film that there is a long line of people wanting to be John Malkovich, wanting to forget who they are for 15 minutes, but that does not mean That is the only thing that this movie is about, since it is a gallery of topics related to the human mind, there is even a chimpanzee that takes its own identity and even seems to be aware, Craig in an early scene of the movie he say that animals don't have conscience, this is one of the dialogues of the movie that caught me the most.Curiously Maxime is the only character that does not enter the head of John Malkovich, she does not want to be John Malkovich, it is because she is the strongest and controlling character in history, all who enter John Malkovich end up losing their minds, Maxime He only takes advantage of the characters throughout the story, even at the end when he confesses to Lotte that the son he expects is from her, a certain tone of manipulation can be noticed in her, perhaps she lied only to get away with it.Being John Malkovich is a story with the most notable features of Charlie Kaufman; Depressive characters and an existentialist vision of the world, we are lucky to have a screenwriter like Charlie Kaufman among us.",Being John Malkovich
307,rimsey-2,This one's a zebra,10,10 January 2000,There are so many tacky one-trick movies made these days (and many of them go on to earn a small fortune)that when I first saw a trailer for this movie and it described how it was about a man who finds a portal into someone else's head my immediate reaction was to wonder what sort of crap was going to be foisted on us now. But this time I was wrong. It reminds me of a quote from a book I read recently about horses and zebras. Its something along the lines that because horses are common and zebras are rare (at least they are outside of Africa) then if you hear hooves coming its likely to be horses. Every now and again though the unexpected happens and thats how I feel about this movie. From the opening minutes of this film you know you're seeing something unique and part of the brilliance of this movie is that it never slackens its pace. Surely one of the best movies of the last 10 years. It deserves the awards its already won and should go on to get a whole lot more.,Being John Malkovich
308,kwa1063,"Interesting premise, but...",5,25 June 2000,"Well, tonight I finally watched this much-talked-about film that I have been dying to see, and I am disappointed to say...I was slightly disappointed. I love John Malkovich in anything, and Catherine Keener is one of my favorite character actresses. But the first hour of the movie was sooo ploddingly slow, I was itching to turn it off. I'm glad I didn't because it got much better in the last hour. (I realize a lot of the posts here say the opposite, that the first hour was better, but I beg to differ. To each his own, I guess). I myself enjoyed the in-jokes with Charlie Sheen, Sean Penn, etc. John Malkovich himself was great, as usual, and though John Cusack, Cameron Diaz, and Catherine Keener were good, too, I still don't see the need for Catherine's Oscar nomination. It was an excellent idea and some of the bits were great--the trip Cameron and Catherine took through Malkovich's subconscious (you have to wonder if those were real experiences of his youth!) was suberb, and the flashback that Elijah the chimp had to the jungle and his parents being tied up was very good and touching, as well.The end could have been tied up a little bit better, i.e., where was the portal to enter Emily's head? All in all it was entertaining but there could have been a little more to hold my attention in the first half. It was thought-provoking, but they could have done more with the concept instead of focusing on that bizarre love triangle.",Being John Malkovich

Malkovich is a great subject for such a premise, but the plot revolves around sex, jealousy, and manipulation rather than any of a host of other elements that would have been more compelling and made full use of the potential of the premise. Other than Malovich, the characters come off as very shallow and empty. I was impressed with the puppetry scenes, which surprised me with their artistry, there are some great quirky elements of the film, and the brief appearances by Charlie Sheen are very funny. This is a film worth watching, but I feel it is definitely NOT one of the greatest filmes of all time. Don't go in with the expectation of being amazed by what some feel is true greatness, and you will probably enjoy the film. Personally, I only give it a 6-7 out of 10.

As he shares this discovery with others in his life, a whole series of events mushrooms which asks myriad questions of identity, gender, relationships, and age. A real John Malkovich and pal Charlie Sheen play themselves, although John is not necessarily living his 'real' life.

It's definitely a worthwhile watch for those who ponder.",Being John Malkovich
315,polos_are_minty,Brilliant,8,19 April 2010,"Well, where to start. The beginning seems a very good idea, I first saw this film in 2000, although at my then young age I was put off by some elements of the film, I generally loved it. It's possibly the quirkiest and strangest film I own. It is surreal, and has an original, clever and funny plot. It is rare to find a film quite like this one, the acting is superb, especially the title character of John Malkovich. Cameron Diaz is also worth a mention, for an engaging and brilliant performance, I would like to see a lot more of this sort of thing from her, as opposed to the usual stuff she makes. Her appearance in this film proves that she can act.Spike Jonze, the films director, previously made his name directing music videos. Being John Malkovich, was his first foray into the feature film, in my opinion he has acquitted himself honourably. The direction is brilliant. Especially, a lot of the puppet sequences, which were fantastic and show real skill. Jonze has also filled the film with quirky little touches, for instance when Craig first discovers floor 7 1/2 it is exactly 7 minutes and 30 seconds into the film. While adding nothing at all to the film, it does come across as a clever thought. Another clever clue, is when Lottie ( Diaz) enters the Malkovich room in Lesters house, if you look at the door knob, it is precisely the same one as on the portal door.One of my favourite scenes of the film is when Malkovich himself enters his own mind. The first time I watched the film I had a due sense of horror and dread as he crawled along the little tunnel. I really had no idea what was going to happen. It is rare to find a moment in a film which is as clever as it is funny, yet when Malkovich enters his own mind we are rewarded with just a moment.The pacing of the film is excellent, in films of this variety, it normally works that the build up is excellent, but the ending is a total let down, on thus occasion I don't think that is the case at all. Throughout the films entire length, you're eyes are glued to the screen. The story moves forward at exactly the pace you want it to, I never once feel desperate for the ending, and I don't have any unanswered questions at the end of the film, which is always a good sign.I must talk about John Malkovich, who I tghink was crucial for the film to work. In my eyes had you replaced Malkovich with any other big name actor the film wouldn't of worked. Malkovich's acting was excellent, and you can clearly tell that he had fun playing a fictionalised version of himself. On some omissions actors clearly go for a role they know will be fun, I think that is what Malkovich has done here. Taking on an extremely rare opportunity to portray himself. Well I say portray himself, for that is another brilliant part of his performance, how he is able to get the audience to suspend their disbelief and really believe there is someone else controlling his body, actions and life. I can't speak highly enough of Malkovich, he has taken everything in his stride and has clearly had a good time, and is a very good sport for allowing certain childhood scenes to be shown, when most actors would of refused.The film does have some serious issues, for example it does offer an opinion on the American publics growing obsession with celebrity, and the desire to achieve fame and wealth. The films tag line 'Ever Wanted To Be Someone Else?', sums this up. The film does show the lengths some people are willing to go to, to get what they want. But it does it in a light hearted and funny way.All this said, there admire things about the film I don't like. The surrealism at times goes to far, with the flashbacks to the Monkeys childhood being a particular example of this. The character of Maxine is also very weak when compared with some of the others, being shallow, self serving and with little depth. However on the whole I can't really fault it on these two grounds. It is a cult classic, and is perhaps one of the most loved independent American films for a very good reason.I am dubious where to score this, I know it definitely deserves an 8, but reading what I've written it is going to be...9/10",Being John Malkovich
316,sal_ruggiero,"A funny, unique film!",9,7 July 2000,"IT'S A PLOT OUTLINE - THERE MIGHT BE A SPOILER!""Being John Malkovich"" has to be one of the most...different films that actually work. Charlie Kaufman deserved an Oscar for his screenplay - his ideas were so twisted, hilarious, and genius.The parts were well acted, the dialogue was very funny. ""Being John Malkovich"" begins with a great opening scene - a puppet show. John Cusack who plays the puppeteer Craig Schwartz does this amazing realistic puppet show. It's great. Then we get to meet Cameron Diaz, his wife and a freaky pet lover that believes her chimp is having mind problems because he is a chimp. Since Craig isn't getting money from the puppet gig, he's forced to get work.Craig gets work at as a filer at an agency on the SEVENTH AND A HALF FLOOR. The secretary he meets is hilarious. That scene is a great one. At work, he meets Maxine, played by Catherine Keener (who does the most superb work of the year!) Craig starts beginning to like her, trying to hit on her, but with her b*tchy attitude, it doesn't go well.Then at work Craig drops a folder behind the cabinet. He moves the cabinet to find a door in the wall. It's very small. He enters and gets sucked through a tunnel. Then suddenly we are looking through the eyes of John Malkovich.After fifteen minutes, Craig is spontaneously dropped by the side of the New Jersey Turnpike. He goes back to the office to tell Maxine - who doesn't believe him. Then he sends his wife (Cameron Diaz) through the tunnel. She looks through John's eyes...while he's in the shower. When he comes out she tells her husband that she's thinks she is a transexual. Maxine develops a plan to make $200 every time someone goes through, and it succeeds until John Malkovich finds out.It's a great movie.

317,chervenkov,Watch the first 15 min and you will know if it's for you,10,16 March 2021,"This thing is twisted, funny, mind-bending and a hundred other things I cannot express. My thoughts after it ended were something similar to: ""Wait another human thought of this plot"", ""Wait.... studio executives read the script and decided to fund it??"", This film is like from different dimension compared to anything that comes in movie format these days.There are certain themes being explored that make it more coherent than it might appear initially - Identity, seeing the world through the eyes of another person, the lengths to which people go to be loved (Cusack's character literally tries to have different body) etc.There is one particular scene which imprinted on my brain: Malkovich operating a puppet in a live show while being the ""literal puppet"" of Cusack's character who himself is professional puppeteer. (Who writes this???)
There is something sort of demented in the fact Cusack's character literally cannot find a job in the real world as puppeteer. Contrast that with Malkovich taking the world by storm after deciding (while controlled by Cusack) to transition from actor to puppeteer. I mean it is messed up, the performances are equally skillful in both scenarios (how could they not be?) but with wildly different outcomes. I think the writing in certain parts is mind blowingly good.The only negative I i can think of is the weird ending that felt rushed, although it had me rolling as well. Still giving it max score, because if this is not a 10 for me, then nothing will ever be. Forgot to mention there is a random scene with Charlie Sheen being bold. 😃",Being John Malkovich

I've always viewed him as a slightly overrated actor.  Kind of self-important.  It's refreshing that he must see this as well.  The other actors are just as charismatic.  They must have known that no one has ever done a movie like this before (at least that I've seen in my years).

Jonz is a talent that likely will flourish as he has that ability, like my favorite directors, of creating a time and a place, an environment, that the viewer enters and inhabits along with the characters.

321,BrendanMichaels,A Malkovichian Experience That Can Never Be Replicated,10,1 April 2016,"A film like this has some great ideas in its head. What if you could go inside the head of one of the most underrated actors of all time, John Malkovich? That's a question that you've probably never thought of but wish you did after seeing one of the best films of the 20th century, Being John Malkovich. Easily a movie that could only be written by the one and only genius madman himself Charlie Kaufman and directed by the other genius madman Spike Jonze. The genius of this film is the subtext surrounding itself. Being John Malkovich is a film about identity, longing, the complexities of the mind and what we really want out of life.The film starts with Craig Schwartz, played by John Cusack, using a marionette puppet destroying his property around him. The puppet looks strikingly like Schwartz and in that one scene we see the complexities and possessiveness of Cusack's character in just one scene. Being John Malkovich is about said puppeteer, Craig Schwartz, who gets work at office 7 ½ discovers a doorway in his office that when entering inside of it allows you to be in the mind of John Malkovich. But as the film progresses Schwartz is finding out more and more about the people he loves as he delves in more into the psyche of Malkovich. The wonderfully original script by Charlie Kaufman who has written some of my favorite movies, Adaptation, Anomalisa, and my personal favorite of his Synecdoche, New York. It's funny how I have just found the time to watch what has now just become, in the matter of a few hours, one of my favorite films of all time. It's mix of drama and comedy makes this a standout of any film that will ever exist. Being John Malkovich is a triumph to the world in saying that crazy can make the world a better more brighter place for film.Spike Jonze has impressed me ever since I saw his marvelous romance film, Her, and by seeing his directorial debut it shows me that Jonze has never lost that spark of creativity or brilliance that was shown to the world in 1999. It's shocking to realize that this was his first feature film and has topped many people's favorite films of all time. I can see a bit of what Kaufman and Jonze would bring to the world in the next decade. In a way Jonze and Kaufman is making us the audience Craig Schwartz. By letting us infer on what they want to show us and what the characters in their movie are trying to express but can't with the possessiveness of Schwartz. It's truly fantastic that a movie can let us feel what we want to feel rather than how we feel. I haven't gotten into this as much but Being John Malkovich is one of the funniest dark comedies I have ever seen in my life. It has a great mesh of it and isn't always hilariously goofy or always grimly dark but a good mixture of the two that will never be replicated. Much like the performances in this that will never be replicated.This movie is filled with career bests for everyone in the cast. John Cusack, Catherine Keener, Cameron Diaz, and the one and only John Malkovich give mind boggling prowess to their roles. As mentioned previously Cusack can easily bring a complexity to a character that you should hate but you don't because of his empatheticness and possessiveness. He bends the ways of how the audience sees him to try to paint a false idol of what he wants to be but isn't. Sadly he explores the part in us humans that we can never escape from, not getting what we think we deserve. Schwartz goes crazy mad when he spills his heart and guts for a woman that couldn't care less about him. Diaz has the best performance of her career in this film. She brings the side of humanity of trying to find out who we are and are we actually being honest to ourselves or are we just trying to change ourselves so that we can be the best for other and not what's best for us. But the standout of this is the titular actor/character himself, John Malkovich. Malkovich brings the side of humanity that is quite fascinating to me. Are our thoughts actually our thought? Are we thinking what we want to think or is an outside source just making us think the things they want us to think. I'm honestly surprised that I have written this much about only 3 characters in this film. But isn't that what shows the beauty of this film? That I can dissect it and think about it at this level of depth and still be mesmerized by it and want to go back and rewatch it as soon as possible! I think so.Being John Malkovich is the greatest gift the 1990s ever left on us and shows that we don't need to follow the same norms that the Hollywood industry has put on us as audience members and we can see actual bright ideas that don't follow the normalcy of what we put up with throughout the year.

322,Benjy,"Malkovich, Malkovich",10,1 August 2000,"There are simply not enough superlatives in the English language to describe this film. It is however, the best film I saw in the 90s, right up there with Shawshank Redemption, Fight Club and the handful of other movies which fit into that all too small subsection of 90s culture. This film was not even given a general release in the UK because to quote my local cinema manager ""It's too arty"". He was wrong, it is a piece of art but above all it is a piece of classic cinema which can be understood and appreciated by anyone with a brain. Perhaps people round here are too stupid. The Cinema owners of the UK certainly are. I've been a fan of Spike Jonze ever since he directed the video to Buddy Holly by Weezer. Being John Malkovich was a perfect choice of script for his first feature film and while I still haven't seen American Beauty (if you can believe that!) it's going to have to be mighty impressive to beat Jonze's first film. To describe Being JM as quirky and off the wall does not do it justice. In an age lacking originality, here I believe we have re-discovered some of that precious commodity. We have no obvious hero, no good people, only greedy self serving people. Art reflecting life perhaps? Perhaps not but this film will truly appeal to the cynical generation weened on a diet of cash and superficiality who are seeking just a little more, the eighties kids. We have no culture, no great defining moment in our lives. Our idea of nostalgia is to talk about 70s kids TV programmes. Being John Malkovich is not a great defining moment, it is not the Beatles on Ed Sullivan's show or the end of the Second World War but at least it gives us something to think about and something better to talk about than the Banana Splits and Bagpuss.",Being John Malkovich
323,Flints,Becoming nonsense,2,11 May 2000,"Okay, I get it. ? I don't get it.  This film is not a total waste of time.  It has some interesting scenes and some good performances, BUT - I think that John Malkovich needs help.  This man is not an actor, he reminds me of that other crazy, Andy Kauffman.  I can't imagine the writer/writers of this film did not have assistance from the very beginning from Mr. Malkovich and that is frightening.  I would rather have my children watch the tapes of the Columbine High School shootings than watch this trash.  However, Orson Bean was superb!!",Being John Malkovich
324,mreisman,"Very good, but not exactly uplifting",8,8 November 1999,"Let me start off by saying ""Being John Malkovich"" IS a very good movie. It's one of the most interesting, unusual and thought-provoking films I've seen this year. I still can't believe Malkovich himself agreed to star in it, and I still have the sublimely ridiculous themes and surreal images I saw a week ago in my head. The acting is solid, the directing is good, the writing is sharp and the story is compelling.So why wasn't I wholly satisfied by this movie? Why do I feel now, as I did when the credits were rolling, that something was missing, and that this work is overrated? Well, having some distance, I think I've figured it out. It has to do with sympathy for the characters. Basically, I didn't have any.Each character is flawed to such a degree, through greed, selfishness, and insecurity, that he/she ultimately comes off as a two-dimensional puppet. I found it impossible to put myself in anyone's shoes, ironically, because none of them are comfortable in their own. The characters who succeed are the ones who are the most adept at using and abusing the other characters, and, of course, at abusing the body of John Malkovich. Catherine Keener's character makes a point in the film about how there are those who ""take what they want, and then there's everybody else"" (I'm paraphrasing). That point is explored in the film, but ultimately, the message (and I only mention this because the film does have philosophical aims) becomes ""It's a dog-eat-dog world out there"".  There is no love, no moral anchor.  And that's why, despite its very clear style and simple but intriguing plot, I couldn't totally get into it.The characters go through changes which are wholly believable and uplifting. Rent it.",Being John Malkovich

Yes, I read the reviews, but so many films lately possess great reviews, but then when I see the flick, I just can't comprehend the praise. Not this one. This movie truly deserves the praise it has been given. This film is quirky, odd, original, which is hard to come by, unusual, strange, unnatural yet natural, bazaar, silly, exact, and in general, a pleasure. I was pleased with the direction, the acting, and most of all, the story which never ceased to amaze and always found a new door to crawl through and a new insight always lay at the other end.

And this morning, to my surprise, I read in the NY Times review that it would be playing tonight and tomorrow.Boy, am I glad I showed up early and hunted down a spare ticket (it was sold out) at the New York Film Festival.  Cusack, Malkovich and Keener perform wonderfully, as do Diaz and the supporting cast.You probably know what this film is about, and if you don't I won't spoil it, but whatever you've heard, take a chance and see it.  It is a winner and I predict a nomination for Best Original Screenplay Oscar, and possibly some acting awards for Keener, who turns in a first rate performance.A strange inner life takes over the story, and it truly challenges the viewer to think about the strangest and even profound questions of reality, love, existence and life and death.  But mostly it was goofy, surreal and very clever.What a treat it was to see the actors walk the red carpet, pose for the cameras and whisper to each other on the way in to the show.  And it was a privilege to ask the writer questions in person at the panel afterwards. I'm definitely joining the Society and will make sure I see more films this way.

331,ProfDave,The first of its kind,10,10 March 2000,"This film is original, captivating, fascinating, and when I went to see it, it completely held me, from start to finish. The material is very well-organized (a credit to Kaufmann, the screenwriter), and it is an aesthetic delight. The ultimate strengths are the performances, themselves.Cusack is the definitive straight man (I hope history is kind to him, and that he is rewarded for his efforts, in the future, for his work in what I feel are some of the best films ever made). Catherine Keener is a dynamic presence, with intelligence and wit to match, and I found a new respect for Cameron Diaz, who has really established herself, this year (in this role, among others), as not just a pretty face, but an intelligent, diverse actress that deserves to be taken seriously. It is a shame that she didn't fall among the ranks of Academy nominee for her role in this film, but, as I've said, before, there are only so many spaces to fill.Malkovich, himself, was the most impressive; unfortunately, we don't think about it, until later. Even if he is portraying (a version of) himself, this is bar-none his best role, to date. He successfully becomes a vehicle, not only for his own caricature, but for that of the other characters in the film. He is a genuinely gifted (and brave) man.The only minor complaint about this film (and it is minor) is that a few of the characters seem to readily accept the oddities or ramblings they are presented with, or already know details about something without any evidence (on the audience's part) of having received them, in advance. An example of this is when Craig (Cusack) first tells Maxine (Keener) about the porthole, and she sarcastically dismisses what is said as ramblings, at least at first, but a few minutes later, she instigates the notion of capitalizing on it, at a point where we, as onlookers, still believe that she thinks (or should think) that the door in question is a figment of Craig's imagination. I didn't quite buy that.Nevertheless, it is what it is, and that is magnificent. In a way, it is the '2001: A Space Odyssey' of 1999, in that it is the first of its kind (I imagine that a whole slough of rip-offs and descendants will come about in the years, ahead), and that it has the same level of reception by the Academy of Motion Pictures (i.e. a nod for Best Directing, but not Best Picture). Jonze, himself, deserves credit for successfully pulling this off; despite this being his first film, he is a artist of dynamic proportions, as proven by his portfolio of music videos. He is a legend in the making, and 'Malkovich' is the foundation.",Being John Malkovich
332,redneck-6,"Highly original concept, though a bit formulaic at the end",7,18 June 2000,"This is definitely one of the more bizarre films I've seen.  You probably know the story by now.  A bland, unimportant man with a passion for puppets (Craig) finds himself lusting for a selfish cynical female coworker(Maxine), who pays him no mind until he finds something she thinks can be of use to her:  a door which takes people into the mind of John Malkovich.  For fifteen minutes,  someone can see, hear, smell, taste, and most importantly feel everything the actor experiences.  Problems arise,  however,  when Craig's wife (Lotte) becomes addicted to the experience,  and the way it allows her to actualize her desire to have the same woman her husband wants, even if only while being John Malkovich.The atmosphere is bleak,  but befitting what ends up being such a bleak tale.  The movie presents the surreal and supernatural as existing rather matter of factly and characters never seem to question the existence or plausibility of the portal.  But, this isn't a movie trying to pass itself off as reality anyway.  It becomes a somewhat intense character study early on,  and the director chose (wisely I think) not to waste time trying to validate the existence of the door into Malkovich's head.  The characters all give excellent and convincing portrayals of highly dysfunctional people. John Malkovich,  while he spends very little time onscreen as himself,  is fascinating to watch being controlled and manipulated by others.  In the end,  he is someone nobody ultimately is concerned with.  Everyone simply wants to take what it is they desire for themselves through the use of him regardless of his own feelings.  And, in that way,  everyone displays a strange obliviousness to being John Malkovich.My biggest complaint with the film is that rather than making some obvious philosophical statements on the nature of being and consciousness which could have easily been put forth by the existence of the portal,  it instead seems to concentrate on merely relating the tale of the most bizarre love triangle you'll ever witness.  That it does very well and in an engaging manner,  but the possibilities of the portal still seem strangely unexplored in the end.  Perhaps,  however,  whatever message is trying to be conveyed is wrapped up in the story itself.  I am certain the movie is full of symbolic imagery and actions that will take some time to digest. 
If you want to experience an almost surreal movie that will stick with you for some time, this is probably a good pick.  If you don't like movies where the implausible and fantastic is accepted without question,  however,  it's probably not going to appeal to you.",Being John Malkovich

Cameron Diaz is absolutely amazing in it, and Catherine Keenan's chemistry with her is sizzling.  John Cryer makes a great anti-hero for the piece, and Malkovich himself is probably the only actor who cold pull it off.  He should have won a special Oscar for this.

Sure, the idea is very intriguing, and original, but they could have done so much more with it. The puppeteer was a great character, but there should have been more intriguing characters around him. The two women weren't that at all, and their acting was also quite poor. The story could have been built up much more interesting. For starters, the whole idea of being able to enter someone's mind, which the puppeteer finds out at some point, should not have been given away so easily and quickly to others. He tells it too soon, and the women believe it and find it out too soon. And the whole reaction is too calm. What would YOU think if you'd hear you could actually go inside someone's brain. Their reaction was more like ""Oh, aha, well, I see. Okay then..."" This movie cannot receive a high rating just because of an intriguing concept. It must also be worked out well. Which is not the case here, because most parts of the movie are, well, quite boring, actually.Rating from the Dutch judge: 6 (out of 10).",Being John Malkovich

This is the strangest film that I have ever watched, such as a hole connecting to the inside of a famous actor and people who are about to advantage of such a hole. However, this film is a comedy, so I could enjoy it without thinking deeply. After watching it, I thought of what to do if I could become someone famous. On the contrary, I felt that it would be fearful if my remarks or expressions could be controlled by someone.

Depressive puppeteer John Cusack finds a job on the 7 and a half floor of a building. When he turns up to work the floor is only half a storey high and no one seems to make sense.His job leads him to find a portal in the form of the small door. The portal leads the person into John Malkovich's head for 15 minutes before being dropped on the New Jersey turnpike. After trying to market this product, John Cusack's character gets bored and decides to permanently take over Malkovich to see what kind of life he would lead.After reading that quick summary of the plot you must be thinking how can a film with such a stupid and bizarre plot be any good? I ensure you, that the sheer originality of this film will keep you entertained! The plot, script, acting and humour are all top notch in this film over-ally delivering one of the greats of cinema history.10/10",Being John Malkovich
337,RisingStar12,Ever Wish You Could Be Someone Else? Now You Can!,8,9 January 2011,"There are some films whose plots are so obvious from the very beginning that it is a wonder why they are even made. You know the movies, the ones that begin ""Once Upon a Time"" and end with ""Happily Ever After."" And, to a certain extent, there is a chain of events that most films follow whether they mean to or not. Being John Malkovich is not such a film. If the film poster—which shows an auditorium filled with the actor John Malkovich head in front of various bodies—makes you feel strange or makes you say, ""That looks too weird for me"", then this may not be what you are looking for. If you are someone, however, who wants to see something very abnormal, very original, and very brilliant, then welcome! Feel free to jump inside of the head of John Malkovich.This is a crazy film, and the worst thing to do to a crazy film is to reveal too much of the plot. It starts off with a struggling puppeteer named Craig Schwartz who finds an advertisement in the newspaper for ""a man with very fast fingers."" As he is used to working with his hands, this is the perfect job opportunity for him. On the first day of work, he finds that his office building is located on the 7 ½ floor (which can only be opened when the elevator is stopped between the 7th and 8th floor and a metal wrench is inserted into the doors of the elevator.) Shortly after working there, he discovers that there is a portal in the office that leads to the head of actor John Malkovich. Once inside the portal, you can experience life through John Malkovich for fifteen minutes. This was all I knew before stepping into the world of Being John Malkovich and I believe that it is all one should know. What follows is an insane film filled with great acting, great directing, and genius writing. The characters are strange, yet they (eventually) become very real and their uniqueness soon becomes relatable. This did not feel like a film that was strange just for the sake of being strange. Everything that happens seems to fit perfectly. As with any unique idea, there is always the risk of being too ridiculous or having the results be a disaster. Never once does this film venture off into that territory. It could have been a giant mess, but instead it manages to be beautiful. The motive that the characters have is one of the most universal wants there is: to be able, if only for a few minutes, to be someone else, to live life through the eyes of someone else. This is a seemingly simple task. It is not. One of the great things that this film highlights is the ""domino effect"" that all of us are a part of. We cannot live our lives without interrupting the life of someone else. Every action we commit affects someone, which in turn affects someone else, which in turn affects someone else. It is a continuous circle that never stops, no matter our age, gender, or position in life. And just when we tell ourselves, ""It can't get any stranger than this,"" it does.",Being John Malkovich

I've followed Spike Jonzes career for years, John Cusack is one of my favourite actors and Cameron Diaz... Well let's just say that my feelings towards Cameron Diaz are pretty much the same as every other hetrosexual male's. So this should have been a slam dunk. I liked the concept of the film, the reviews were glowing, I was receptive, pumped and primed.Then I saw the film...And it did suck. Balls.Huge great hairy balls of suckiness.There was not a single character I felt any affinity to. I found the situations contrived and pointless. The ideas explored were either  bland or annoying. The acting was over the top and all I was left with was an uncomfortable desire to slap everyone involved.Was my reaction a little extreme? Perhaps, but I don't feel too bad, given that I seem to be in the minority here. Everyone appears to love this film. People go on and on about it, so if I've missed the point, well, my opinions are hardly going to drown out the true believers. But what if I'm right and they're the ones who are wrong?

341,Nikos-12,"Disrespectful, bizarre - and utterly brilliant",8,28 May 2000,"Director Spike Jonze's first full-length feature is a work of demented genius. Jonze, whose previous work includes the video for Fat Boy Slim's Praise You and a small role in David Russell's 'Three Kings', has created something virtually unique: a film far too bizarre to ever get studio interest, but with main-stream stars and a world-wide release.
Craig Schwartz (John Cusack) is a brilliant but pretentious and egotistical puppeteer. His frumpy animal-obsessed wife Lotte (Cameron Diaz, looking plain  I told you this was weird) urges him to get a proper job, which he eventually does, sorting files on floor 7 ½ of an office building, where the ceiling is so low he is forced to crouch all the time. There he meets a very attractive woman (Catherine Keener) who isn't at all interested in him until he finds a magical portal into the mind of John Malkovich. She suggests charging $200 for fifteen minutes in the great man's head, after which the passenger is dumped onto the verge by the New Jersey turnpike.
To explain any more of the (increasingly odd) plot would only convince you not to watch this film. This would be a bad decision, as Jonze handles the idea (by Charlie Kaufman  arrest this man, he must be a danger to society) with a deftness that astounds. The ridiculous concept is only half of the film  the reactions to the supernatural are the real charm. The concept is not clouded by philosophical considerations of self, as Schwartz naively believes, but by love, jealousy and greed.Of course, this turns on the central performances. Malkovich is wonderful as himself and adapts his performance brilliantly as the plot requires. Cusack bravely loses all attractive character traits to create Craig, a jealous impotent idiot with ideas above (and indeed, outside of) his head and Diaz is equally remarkable as the wacky Lotte. It is Catherine Keener however, who steals the film with a display of such massive selfishness and egotism that she fully deserved her recent Oscar nomination. These performances, and a host of cameos, some less than a second (spot Winona Ryder and Jennifer Aniston), really make a film that is in danger of being a little too weird. I have no idea how this got made, but thank goodness it did  it waves two fingers at Hollywood and runs off giggling.",Being John Malkovich

Unfortunately, like other original films such as Eraserhead or Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas, it will be too much to handle for anyone who is put off by a lot of weirdness in movies.

Let's just get that out of the way off the bat. Before I started watching, I was already excited to see how such a bizarre idea could function on screen. But, a lot of movies don't live up to their premise, and this is one of them.It isn't just the premise that is bizarre: the characters are even more wacky. In a strange and unfamiliar world, I expect a movie to have a strong protagonist with whom I can identify. This movie had no such thing. The protagonist is so strange and illogical that the viewer feels like an outsider looking in for the entirety of the film. When everyone on screen is a weirdo, I'm not too invested in their interpersonal drama.""Weird"" and ""deep"" are not one in the same. Jonze puts a cast of weird characters on screen but he gives them no depth. Catherine Keener's character is the supreme example of this: she is supposed to be confident, sexy, and complex, but she comes off as random, illogical, and weird. She doesn't act like a real person, she acts like a poorly written character in a film that's trying too hard to be artsy.Nonetheless, the movie packs some laughs. Appearances from celebrities playing themselves is always good for a smile from the audience, and this film does it in an amusing way. There are also two short mockumentaries within the film that are pretty much gold.If you are drawn to the premise like I was, or you like Jonze's other work, you're probably going to watch this movie.

He uses this to reach the inner mind of Maximes through another person's body. Now he succeeds to get her attention, although maxime doesn't know it's him in John but still thinks it's Lotte. The character of Maxime shows well the way people think these days. She loves the inner of Craig Schwartz, and she loves the outer of John Malkovich. She is out to richness, wealth, fame, all the things that make you supposingly happy these days, without taking in regard that true happiness is inside, and not on the outside. A surrealistic film to think about, not a masterpiece though, more like a documentary how to live in a good way. To understand that it's NOT BETTER BEING SOMEONE ELSE, but it's better to be YOURSELF. People always find eachother, no matter who you are. 8.5/10",Being John Malkovich
348,revcosmo,disappointing,4,21 August 2005,"I had a great deal of expectation for this film, and perhaps in a way, that interfered with my enjoyment of it. I had heard loads of positive things about it... the plot sounded intriguing and original, and I had read that it had a Terry Gilliam sort of sensibility.Unfortunately, few of these positive traits were actually borne out in the film. It did kind of seem a bit like a Terry Gilliam film, but it felt a lot more like a cheap Gilliam knock-off than any sort of inspired film-making. There was a lot of potential in many of the ideas of the film, but most often they were executed without the finesse of a truly creative director. Instead of seeming original and innovative, most moments in the film just seemed like half-assed attempts at creativity.Which is a shame, and in a sense made the experience of watching it even more distressing. Because there were definitely inklings of a great film somewhere in there, they just never really made it to the light of day.",Being John Malkovich

However, the relationships between the characters was inconsistent, for lack of a better word and I just could not accept their behavior as being believable.I think it would have been much more successful if it were simply quirky and offbeat, OR a movie about the relationships.  It was as though the quirkiness was not enough to sustain the plot.I'm sure very few out there agree with me, but I'd give it a 7/10.

I went in hearing the hype and expected a good flick, but was skeptical. However, my critical glasses crashed to the floor because I was laughing so hard. It was funny, ironic, and idiosyncratic. I expected it to be bizarre, and thought provoking, but I didn't expect it to be so goddamn hilarious. If you breathe oxygen and have ever fantasized about leaving your body for, say, 15 minutes, you should check this out. John Cusack and Cameron Diaz are both virtually unrecognizable, and here dramatically redeemed for flaky flops they've been in the past. John Malkovich is superb as expected, the writing is kooky beyond belief, cinematography interesting, direction dead on. Fabulous. Thumbs, hell, all fingers, toes too-- way up.",Being John Malkovich

When I first saw ""Being John Malchovich"" in the theaters I was amused and intrigued. I was also put off by the unsavory characters and a cryptic, rather hollow ending. But the damn thing haunted me, so I watched it again. I'm now into my third viewing. It just gets better. There's so much more to it than meets the eye.

355,hepasto,definitely worth watching,7,12 January 2003,"This film is full of holes and sometimes what the characters do are quite hard to believe. But it doesn't matter cause this is supposed to be a surrealistic film. It talks about how our ""skin"" affect different things.For example, the puppeteer was miserable and dispised upon when he was in his own skin, but it was ironic the way he archieved huge success only when he possessed John Malkovich's body.Another example is how Maxine was only interested in Lotte only ""when she's John Malkovich"".So is it that John Malkovich is an avatar from god so that there are things only he couldve succeed at? I don't think so, and the film doesn't think so when Maxine was married to Lotte in the final act.Perhaps Craig could've done everything on his own if he only he has tried harder.The film also talks about obssession and honesty in different ways. I'd recommend this to everyone.I'd give this a 7/10. Points down because the charactors act strangely sometimes. (for one, who would choose climb into a dark, spooky tunnel like that just because someone told you that its a portal to someones brain? The funny thing is everyone in the film was so easily conviced. )",Being John Malkovich
356,metalrules31,Probably the most original film of the last years,10,6 November 2008,"Been John Malkovich catches your attention since the moment you read its title. It is a strange title for a movie, and even more when you, like the characters in the movie, have heard the name of the actor but are not able to name any of his movies. If you consider the title to be kind of original, wait until you read the plot. Craig Schwarz (John Cusack) is a failed street puppeteer, married to Lotte (Cameron Diaz, Yes its her!!) , an animal loving woman.Craig realizes he cannot make a living out of his work and decides to look for a job, as a filer. The peculiarity of this office is it is located on the floor seven and a half. Here he meets his boss, and Maxine (Catherine Keener), the latter with whom he happens to fall in love, but is not corresponded. Things start getting even weirder (at least for us, since the characters seem to take it lightly) when Craig discovers a secret door that leads into John Malkovich's head, lets you live through his point of view and then throws you out to a road outside of Jersey. Craig is amazed by his experience and decides to set up an after work business, where people pay $200 for being John Malkovich. Maxine becomes his business partner, but is also having plans of her won. This is an amazing movie for me to spoil since it shows you scenarios you would have never thought about, without leaving you confused at what is happening.The movie's main attraction is its originality, since I can't think of a similar movie (maybe Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, by the same screen player), plus its cast is really good and it gives you the chance to know and watch a little about an untypical form of art like puppetry.",Being John Malkovich
357,Gabriel_Kuntze,Falls apart rather quickly,5,25 March 2021,"Well, well... this was some hell of a ride. I wasn't sure what to expect with this movie, but certainly not this drug fueled trip. I really wanted to like this film, but sadly it has so many flaws that, at least for me, ended with a sour taste in my mouth.First of all, the good things: I liked the concept, the acting (I recognized Cameron Diaz but I had to check it out to make sure), John Cusack is great as the loser hopelessly in love, and the puppet work is amazing - probably the best part of the movie. I loved all the comedy that had nothing to do with the main plot: the silly office, the deaf secretary, the crazy boss, Charlie Sheen cameo... basically, after the first half of the movie, it had its moments of laughs. Sadly it went downhill from there.Now, the bad: the plot went nowhere. I was hoping for some kind of conclusion or idea behind the ego or something like that, but it never came. It basically dwelled 100% in the sexual side of the characters, and never moved away from there. For example, when Craig takes full control of John and he performs in front of Maxine, I was really hoping for him to discover that his skills with the puppets were gone, since he was using another body and his fingers weren't the same, but sadly that didn't happened. That would've been amazing to show us that, regardless of how bad our lives are, everything that makes us ""us"" is unique and personal. Yet, here it seems that if you're very strong and transport to a skinny guy, your strenght goes with you... in your mind, I guess?The whole old-people-trying-to-live-forever thing made no sense. Who took control of John's body after all? Just the main guy? The rest of the people were just prisoners in his mind? What kind of eternal life is that?While I think the actors were good, the characters sucked. Maxine is really cruel and mean, then suddenly she's nice, she hates Craig's puppets, then she asks him to perform for no reason, she doesn't like Lotte physically, then she spends her life with her. Craig only wants to perform with puppets, then he completely forgets about them because he ""fell in love"". Lotte is simply bizarre. At the end, I didn't cared about any of them, because they didn't cared about themselves.The ending is just bitter, at least for me. Basically, nobody learned anything, except that the chicks liked each other. No one seemed to care about John like, at all. Why not a single one of the hundreds of people going into his mind managed to take hold over it, by the way?So, whatever. I'm pretty sure this movie doesn't get bad reviews because it's ""psychological, original, and deep"", therefore if you say anything bad about it it's because ""you didn't get it"". I'm sorry, I think it's just a mess. Great idea, but poorly executed and went nowhere. It does have its moments tho, but they're short and crammed in the beginning.",Being John Malkovich

Getting inside the head of JM for 15 minutes (a take-off on Andy Warhol's '15 minutes of fame'?) only to be dumped out of the air by the side of the New Jersey Turnpike??  Who came up with that?  Cameron Diaz as a frumpy (!) animal lover; John Cusack as a puppeteer; and John Malkovich making such fun of himself while playing himself?  The best scene was when JM went inside his own brain.  What do you think YOU would see?  Plenty of places in this film to laugh out loud.  Look for a couple of nominees on Oscar night.Note:  Believe the `R' rating for your kids (we almost took our 14-yr old until I read the reviews; glad we opted not to).

361,Auselan,In depth analysis (contains spoilers),9,29 July 2001,"Having misunderstood the idea of the film (I thought it was to be a semi-autobiographical documentary), I was pleasantly surprised to follow the superb yarn which is Being John Malkovich'.Its blend of irreverent yet subtle humour (that is reminiscent of Monty Python) draws you into the film immediately.  Early on, as the puppeteer Craig Schwartz (John Cusack) is punched for his bizarrely delicate puppetry of a horny monk, we are introduced to the central irony of the film (to be passionate in any way is to be ridiculous) while also being made aware of a more serious image (the tragic isolation of the artist).  The film tells its jokes  which all tend to ridicule ardent emotion in some way or another - with a straight face.  John Malkovich is flattered and touched that one of his fans loved his portrayal of retard' Lenny (Of Mice and Men', 1992); yet the fan's passionate appreciation is belied by his insensitivity (his callous use of the term retard').There follows a strong storyline punctuated with ugly  yet fascinating - humour: Schwartz (possessing Malkovich's body as if it were one of his puppets) and Maxine discuss making love on Malkovich's table before eating an omelette off it  `Nooo!' shouts Malkovich desperately as he momentarily regains control (the horror of the vulgar proposal giving him strength to break out through Schwarz) .  Later we also watch in amazement as a chubby John Malkovich / Schwartz dances like a puppet for the entertainment of Maxine: hideous yet riveting.Maxine (Catherine Keener), the ultimate callous bitch, is a superb character, acted well.  We are given hints as to her insanity (such as the sex and omelette suggestion), but for the best part, she is simply an uncaring, heartless manipulator.  She is vain to the point of obscenity  `to have two people staring at you with complete lust through the same pair of eyesit's quite a rush'.  She toys with Schwartz and his wife, pitching them against each other in a love triangle of which she has complete control.  In a film that ridicules emotion, she is the only character to come off without looking absurd  when she finally accepts her true love Lotty, it is a sombre and sincere moment, signifying that we are approaching the end of the tale.The ability to control others is the main theme of the film.  Maxine does so by making others desire her, and Schwartz is obsessed with getting inside the skin of others (as a puppeteer).  This links the audience with the actors: we too are watching events unfold through the eyes of others.  The film explores the way art can break down the barriers between self and other; how, for example, when watching a film you can empathise with a character  become them momentarily  but how, at the same time, they are becoming you (after watching `Betty Blue' (1986) how many women have felt psychotic?)  It raises questions about selfhood: are we just one self, or are there many people inside' our minds, making us do things, or say things (friend and family for example, influencing the way we think)?Schwartz is repressed: he can only experience things when he puts himself in the role of someone else and his ultimate punishment is complete repression (being trapped in a child's mind, unable to ever express himself through his vessel').  We get the impression that he is basically an good man, driven insane by his obsession with Maxine and what she represents (complete freedom from the pains and inhibitions of emotion).  He claims `I don't want to be a monster' and he is, indeed, a lousy bad guy.  He waits with a gun for his wife to come home, hiding under the table.  Under a table in his own house!  Then, he bursts out on her, falls over himself in his rush to grab her, by which time the element of surprise is lost, but it was not even necessary since she is completely unprepared to be assaulted by her own husband.  The dance of his puppet ( a puppet which looks like himself ) is the manifestation of his failure as a man.  `The Dance of Despair and Disillusionment' he calls it and it is an allegory of his despair at not being loved by Maxine (whom he loves, rather pathetically, because she is incapable of loving him back), and his disillusionment with the world that doesn't appreciate his art.Cusack and Keener are amply backed up by Cameron Diaz, playing the innocent and vulnerable wife of Schwartz, who ultimately becomes Maxine's lover.  It is a convincing performance by Diaz, which shows off her acting talent in a way that no other film has.  Although she is unattractive - unrecognisable - for the whole film, she is very easy to watch.Despite the absurdity of the plot premise (being, the existence of a tunnel which leads you into the mind of John Malkovich), the package we are presented with is so consistently well done, that it's easy to suspend one's disbelief.  Elements of the basic cinematography such as the subtle, almost natural lighting (unlike a normal cinema film, particularly apparent in the Schwartz apartment) are easy on the eyes and brain.  Throughout the film, you feel like you've been here before.  Whether it is people moving like zombie aliens from some black and white 50's Sci-Fi film (as they navigate the 7 and a half-th floor with their arms flopping forward), or Malkovich singing Malkovich Malkovich Malkovich a la `Fabulous Baker Boys' (1989), we are on familiar screen territory.  The Monty Python influence is more clearly seen on the DVD, with its quack anatomical diagrams.

What this person has failed to realized is that THAT'S THE POINT!  This film is not about everyday people, nor was it made to appeal to an everyday sense of logic.  This film was made with an extreme amount of imagination.  Spike Jonze has made an extremely inventive and brilliant film.One of the other high points of this film is the cast, which features Cameron Diaz, Catherine Keener, John Malkovich himself, Orson Bean, and John Cusack, one of the very best actors of the past two decades (see my review for ""High Fidelity"").  These actors put forth spectacular performances of brilliant characters, driven in part by Jonze's wonderful dialogue.All in all, this is a great film.  One of the best of the past decade.

It took me four nights to experience it. It has some flaws, the biggest being the character played by John Cusack - replace him, and you might have the perfect diversion for a weekend of ""what the hell was that""? As is, it is a movie that demands watching.I am still reeling as I write this review. I don't know where to begin, except to say, if you are inclined to the unusual, the bizarre, and the completely unique, you might want to check this film out. I won't even try to delve into the story, it is just too strange to relate, you have to watch it, you really do, to get it. And even then, it will leave you wondering.Acting, of note, is the amazing performance by John Malkovich . . . as himself, and many others. Quirky, egoistic, vulnerable, and self-indulgent, I think John's portrayal as himself and more is, well, it is very very different, and very brave and challenging. Cameron Diaz, how could they make her look homely? But they do, and Cameron is every bit the odd foil to Malkovich's character. Then there is the woman who plays the crux, Maxine, outstandingly performed by Catherine Keener, who in her lynch pin character, ties the film together. I would be remiss in leaving out the aging Orson Bean and the cynical young and then old Charlie Sheen. You simply have to see them in this film to appreciate.Unless you are an oddball, a thinker, and want to experience something entirely different, I can't recommend this film. But if you are so inclined, I would highly recommend this delve into the possibilities of ""what if you could be John Malkovich?""I give it 3 and 1/2 stars. Good stuff.",Being John Malkovich

I am not good at making reviews, yet I would make the review for this one. Seems so simple, and marketed as a comedy - no idea why? It ain't no comedy. More, it is not funny that much. Of course, you laugh sometimes, but if you watched carefully it becomes more dark and dark as you go deeper into the forest. This movie is about life. About choosing path. About condition of mankind. About being yourself. About hundred other things that are important in life. Did you think American Beauty was about choosing the right path? So you were right, but only to some extent. Just watch ""Being John Malkovich"" and you, (maybe, as it not that obvious:) ), grasp the true meaning of life. I mean it - this movie opened my eyes wider than 100 movies before. Of course, it is just a movie, you won't be millionaire after watching it, but well... You'll get what I mean, soon.Not to mention fantastic screenplay, so original and fresh. I've not come for a screenplay like this before, ever. Maybe ""Truman Show"", being THAT original, hit me as well that much.

The darkness of this movie comes from many sources: the freaky puppetry, Cameron Diaz's wig but, above all, the utter immorality of virtually every single character. In fact, in a neat subversion of the old 'Hollywood is mad' assumption, the only one resembling anything near normality in the world of this picture, is old slaphead himself.Nevertheless, this is an undeniable and unforgettable masterpiece from Hollywood's latest prodigy. You'll laugh like a drain, gape with shock and leave the cinema more than a little disturbed.

It seems to be seen as how YOU are as an individual. Personally, I found this movie innovative with a dream like quality about it. I couldn't make my mind up whether it is a pointless film or a film with a deep meaning. I think the begining where the secretary says "" I can't understand a word you are saying"" and the boss saying ""please try to understand my speech affliction"" when there is nothing wrong with his speech sums it up as a nightmarish  movie.

The story is a piece of geniality and cinema needed it. I don't want to describe scenes or to say the plot, I want just to offer the possibility to anyone who didn't watch it to do it as soon as possible.

The second rule about ""Being John Malkovich"" is: See ""Being John Malkovich."" This is the most original movie I've seen in a few years. (There are no huge explosions, and the lone chase scene doesn't involve cars, planes or space ships.) Unlike many ""art house"" movies, I didn't need to struggle to understand or enjoy it. It's a film about human identity, a story in which a number of characters struggle to express themselves, to find fulfillment and to pursue happiness -- in ways that are rather bizarre.  They live in a skewed version of reality (either that, or New York City has gotten worse since my last visit).  We have passed through the looking glass, and some things are not what they appear to be.  The characters are interesting and well-developed. The humor is dark and incisive. John Cusack and Cameron Diaz are deep in character and barely recognizable. Catherine Keener is the ultimate femme fatale. Orson Bean is hilarious. John Malkovich is brilliant -- and very convincing -- as himself.",Being John Malkovich
379,cho cho,"Creates, and redeems, a brand new perversion",10,22 July 2000,"Puppeteering, for Craig (John Cusack), is the nearest thing to his heart's desire, getting inside another person's skin to animate his soul. It doesn't pay well, so he file-clerks on floor seven-and-a-half of the world's weirdest office building--everyone on this midget-sized floor has to walk around hunched over at the waist. Craig's wife Lotte (Cameron Diaz) wants a baby but makes do with babying disturbed chimps and other castoff fauna.At the office, Craig lusts after no-nonsense Maxine (Catherine Keener). At the after-office-hours watering hole, when he says he's a frustrated puppeteer, she's like, ""Waiter! Check please!"" But after behind a file cabinet he discovers a secret portal into the mind of actor John Malcovich (played by himself)--this is, after all, a fantasy--she senses a business opportunity. They can charge unfulfilled souls $200 to spend 15 minutes in celebrity skin and be spit out safely by the side of the New Jersey Turnpike.No one is keener to try it than Lotte. Somehow she knows it'll be ecstasy, and it is: she immediately wants to become a transsexual. Hearing this, Maxine, cool to Craig but warm to Lotte, has a hot flash which stands her nipples at attention: she'll seduce Malcovich while Lotte is inside him. When Lotte digs it and Craig finds out, Craig locks Lotte in the chimp's cage and, unbeknownst to Maxine and Malcovich, replaces her as the third in a unique ménage à trois.From here, the permutations of identify transfer proliferate to the delight of the viewer, if not always the onscreen characters. The movie creates a brand new form of perversion and then redeems it. Without giving away the ending, it can be revealed that this film extends metaphors of getting inside another person--sex, identity transfer, puppeteering--into unsuspected avenues of redemption and intimations of both novel and traditional versions of immortality.",Being John Malkovich
380,taddo,Jeung's Collective Consciousness,10,6 January 2000,"First off, let me emphasize that as a movie year, 1999 has been on of the best in recent memory.  Being John Malkovich has to be THE most original movie this past year, and one of the best overall.  The basic premise is that a puppet maker, John Cusack, takes a filing job at a strange office on the 7 1/2 floor.  While digging behind one of his filing cabinets he discovers a portal into actor John Malkovich's head.  From that point the movie takes on a truly surrealistic direction.  Eventually there are hundreds of people paying money to spend 15 minutes in John Malkovich's head, witnessing various mundane things like Taxi rides, to the more exotic, like having sex.  This movie also had me asking questions, that were answered later on like, what happens if John Malkovich goes into the portal into his head.  It is an intriguing journey into our more primal fantasies, essentially playing on Psychologist Jeung's collective unconsciousness, twisting it into a ""collective consicousness"".  The movie is quite Freudian in the primal sense, yet drawing on some of the more modern behaviorist philosphies.  Let's all hope that Hollywood wakes up and sees that the ""blockbuster"" is officially dead, and creative intelligent movies are back in full swing.  John Malkovich should be nominated for Best Actor this year. If you haven't seen this movie, go see it today.  Its on par with, IMHO, the best movie of the 90's, American Beauty.",Being John Malkovich

It does, however, contain spoilers for the SCREENPLAY Being John Malkovich, which is available on the internet. These spoilers do NOT give away details of this movie as it can be seen in theaters. In this comment, I don't want to talk much about the movie itself. It is, as you can see from my one-line summary above, excellent. I'm a big fan of the Theater of the Absurd (Beckett, Ionesco etc.) and BEING JOHN MALKOVICH is the cinematic Theater of the Absurd. Great, funny and remarkably clever in every second. But to come to my point: I read the screenplay (not the filmed version, as I found out now) in advance. It literally had me rolling on the floor laughing- and afterwards it had me considering the genius of Mr. Charlie Kaufman- in utter admiration of his talents. So now, having seen the movie, I am a bit disappointed to see that the FANTASTIC original ending (which had the Malkovichians take control of the entire planet and turn it into an Orwell-like dystopia. Lotte (Diaz), who in the beginning, was probably the most bizarre character in the story, becomes the only remaining (recognizable) human being on Earth, who wants to stage a revolution against the terror regime of the Malkovichians, while Craig (Cusack) becomes a puppet himself in the hands of Evil. Oh, and by the way, Lotte marries the monkey!) was replaced by a less favorable ending. But I guess budget considerations were the reason for this decision. Pity. Nonetheless, this film is maybe the most mind-wrenching, funny and clever comedy ever to grace the screens. I think Cameron Diaz is the heart and soul of it in her best performance yet. She should have been the one getting an Oscar nomination. But, still, if you ever have the chance to catch the screenplay on the net: read it! It will enhance your appreciation for this masterpiece even more- and you'll see what a shame it is that such great projects like this one don't get enough money to transport the writer's vision to the screen as it was meant to.

387,gartner,Great first half---weak conclusion,6,10 March 2001,"I don't think there are many spoilers here, but read at your own risk. If you have even seen a trailer or skimmed a review, you know what 'Being John Malkovich' is about. The irony of 'Being John Malkovich' is that once the characters begin actually being John Malkovich, the film seems to stop being interesting.Being an admirer of Malkovich as an actor and being that I had skimmed so many glowing reviews of the film (it was on many top ten lists and was a 4 star film in many circles), I really wanted to like this movie alot before I ever saw it. I also wanted to find a way to justify liking the film more than I did once it was over, but the truth is I was disappointed.The set up of an out of work puppeteer (who only seems to come alive when commandeering one of his marionettes) eventually happening upon a indefinable job for a vague company on the 7 1/2 floor was odd but in an interesting kind of way. Then the portal into Malkovich's mind is unearthed. This seemed like a promising development, but it really falls flat in my opinion.In no time, people are lining up to be in Malkovich's head, but it is not clear why. No one who enters the vehicle of Malkovich's being does anything remotely interesting with their opportunity, not even John Cusack's puppeteer. The puppeteer really does nothing inspired at all, given the ultimate marionette (a living, breathing human being) as his plaything. As character upon character used Malkovich to try to 'bed' each other, I began wishing for Mr. Malkovich to realize what was going on and react to it, but even this action has no payoff. Malkovich's realization results in a strangely amusing scene in which the actor enters the portal himself, but ultimately he never really tries to fight for possession of his 'self'. If he does, we don't see most of it, which is a shame because THAT would have been interesting to watch. 'Being John Malkovich' begins with an ingenious, original distortion ofreality and offers the promise of a strong second half about the importance of self. In the end however, it boils down to many unlikeable characters attempting to achieve their selfish uninteresting goals in life (both current and eternal)through another person (who happens to be John Malkovich, but really could have been anyone for the purposes of the film).The film never ceases being unique, but it ceases being entertaining. 6 out of 10.",Being John Malkovich
388,Jeremiah-8,* * * * for BJM.,9,2 November 1999,"What can be said about ""Being John Malkovich"" without destroying the wonderful surprises in store? Spike Jonze has made numerous short films and videos before embarking upon this visual treat, and he is one of the few music video directors who actually brings a great deal of thought or resonance to his images. His offbeat sensibility is ideally suited for Charlie Kaufman's imaginative and wildly original screenplay. The premise alone, revealed in the title, captures the sense of having your 15 minutes of fame inside an actor who not everyone knows by name.Yes, puppeteer John Cusack takes a job working as a file clerk on the 7 ½ floor, and lo and behold, he discovers a portal into the mind of JM himself. After 15 minutes, he is unceremoniously dumped on the side of the New Jersey turnpike. The film takes its time before providing us with this wonderful scene, thoroughly developing the characters of frustrated artiste Cusack, his frustrated and frumpy wife played by an unrecognizable Cameron Diaz and Cusack's sassy, sexy, vixen-y co-worker Catherine Keener, all in top form (and some under the most brilliant hair design since the Farrelly Brothers virtuoso work in ""Kingpin"".)And then we begin our adventure seeing the world through the eyes of JM, going in directions one wouldn't expect, and even if it does, it goes beyond those initial variables into some truly stunning and unexpected variations in terms of character development, plot, space and time.Well filmed (and surprisingly subtle, not going for large scale effects) with impeccable taste, style and a flair for the theatrical without becoming overpronounced or gauche, Being John Malkovich ranks as one of my biggest delights this screengoing year. John Malkovich, of course, steals the show. It is, after all, his head.",Being John Malkovich
389,jerome-23,"Sinister, constricted and dark film",8,23 March 2006,"One first has to get past the sinister plot by Jonze to agitate the audience using a straight faced played story starring a famous reality story actor who starred in the Killing Fields and Empire of the Sun, Malkovich, playing a character with the same name as himself in this surreal, metaphysical essay on the forces that inspire murder.An understanding that it is the compression of the workers' of the 7 1/2 floor spines and haemic system caused by their constant bending of their bodies to stand that is causing the temporary to permament insanity helps to see this film more clearly.Turning up the brightness or gamma of this picture, 30% or so, illuminates this picture containing images of darkness in many forms, many night shots, both Craig and Lotte's faces at times encaved by their unkempt hair, the drawing of curtains. By contrast one of the few light scenes is set in the past, of children in a school bus.Then a realisation that Craig Schwartz killed his wife that he had tried frequently to adulter and finally felt equal to on gaining employment after luring her to his office with his fantasy story and locking her at night (heatedly on a Thursday when a Friday with the weekend next would obviously be more to his plot, ""tomrrow, that would be perfect"") in a hole behind filing cabinets in a wall taking from Poe's The Tell Tale Heart, ""wet, weird, that's nice, oh, oh, umm, oh, sexy"", chills this macabre, disturbed tale.He spares Maxine, keeping her piously above his level of dirty crime during his serial killing spree with each victim added to his wall. His epitomal goal of killing his wealthy boss and his friends is apparently, eventually achieved in this happy ended film.Being John Malkovich turns into a PC lesbian partnership motherhood story with a happy ending, the fantastical, narcissistic view of Craig being replaced by natural, inevitably prevailing justice.BTW, I've chatted up the pretty, young, lady Bjork, that sings the end credits song, when she was going out with Goldie at a club night of his in London.--- by Jerome, computer coder, author, and voter of 1,000 films.",Being John Malkovich
390,Chessack,A strange and boring movie,1,21 July 2001,"I can honestly say I do not understand why anyone would like this film. It's incredibly strange and surreal, and some people like that, but even if one does, I can't imagine how one would not be bored out of one's skull by this intellect-impoverished movie.The story starts out with a struggling puppeteer, who gets an office job. But the office is located on ""floor 7 1/2"", which is between floors 7 and 8 in an office building. Although there is a bit in the movie that gives a pseudo-explanation for it, the characters don't really believe what they are told, and neither did I. We never find out where floor 7 1/2 came from, which I might have found mildly annoying, if I were interested enough to care (which I wasn't).While working, the puppeteer finds a small doorway, that leads him into John Malkovich's brain. The story, if it weren't strange already, just gets stranger from there. They charge people money to ""be John Malkovich"" for 15 minutes, and when you're done, you end up on the New Jersey Turnpike (how you get there, is never explained). I don't mind a bit of the surreal in a film, but to have the whole entire movie be stranger than your oddest dreams, is just unpleasant.But it's not just the weird goings-on in the movie that made me dislike it. The movie was utterly boring. I did not care a fig about any of the characters in it. I fell asleep twice watching the DVD, and had to re-wind and watch the parts I'd slept through; the second time, I almost just shut it off instead. If I hadn't paid my hard-earned money for it, I probably wouldn't have finished it, to be honest. There's very little reason to keep watching, and I spent most of the time eyeballing the clock and hoping for it to be over.If you like strange, weird movies with no plot, not much character development, and no explanation of what is happening or why, and where almost nothing happens through the whole movie, then you'd probably like Being John Malkovich. If you don't like those things, then you probably won't. I don't like them, so I did not like this movie.My score: 1/10 (and that's only because IMDB doesn't let you give zeros).",Being John Malkovich
391,montoya_luisa,New Surrealist Classic,10,6 December 2002,"Minor Spoilers ahead:Being John Malkovich was one of the best movies released during the past few years. It was surprising that a production of this sort actually made it to the big screen. Hollywood was actually capable of producing a great artistic film, without considering the financial outcomes.This film was not publicized, as expected, since the producers knew from the outset that this film was not going to be a great financial success. The motivation to create this film was to show that there were still some creative minds in Hollywood and that they were not afraid to challenge the old stereotype of the empty Hollywood classic. The style used in this film ties it to its surrealist origins. Through comedy, Being John Malkovich addresses many issues. The first issue dealt with in this film relates to the misfortune of the puppeteer who is trying to show his art and its rejected by a cruel society. The rejection of what in the eyes of Cusack is real art, is revisited throughout the film. Final redemption is brought when Cusack uses Malkovich's body to reach his dream, to be a world-renown puppeteer. This first issue addressed by the film brings to mind some of the works of early French surrealists such as Rene Clair, Jean Renoir and Jean Virgo. The second issue raised in this film relates to sexual desires; in a more Dali-Bunuel style, this film deals with all the sub conscious sexual desires experienced by the characters. The characters in Being John Malkovich get involved in a love triangle. Cusack and Diaz are in love with Keener. Meanwhile, Keener is not sure whom she loves. The last issue dealt with in this film is the desire for common people to be someone else, to be someone that is really important to society as a whole, to be a celebrity. 
Being John Malkovich was one of the best recent works out of Hollywood. This film is a demonstration of the ability of Hollywood to create a good and profound film. As Orson Welles did it in the 1940's, Spike Jonze created a film that showed the film industry that innovative, good films are the pure expression of the seventh art",Being John Malkovich

The film tells such an unusual story that you just cant love it.The plot is very dynamic and thoughtful. Controlling puppets is not the as controlling people from inside. It seemed like an innocent story of a puppeteer who found a hole which takes you inside John Malkovich, but it turned into conspiracy of a bunch of people who use human vessels to live forever.

393,oecobius,Obnoxious and tedious film,1,18 February 2013,"Obviously this film has a clever premise and a number of cute gimmicks along the way (like floor 7 & 1/2), but ultimately they seem to exist just to be in-your-face quirky and zany. They aren't developed in a thought-provoking way, they're simply gimmicks draped around a flimsy and trite social commentary.All the same, this film could at least have been entertaining if it didn't expect you to endure its grating and drab characters. OK, I get it, the characters are all unlikable so that the movie can show how flawed our society is; that's a real cute concept but the characters need to at least be INTERESTING to be worthwhile and satisfying. In keeping with the film's premise, the characters are uniformly flat and gimmicky.The film attempts heavily to be sophisticated and dark and thoughtful in terms of sex, but it's annoyingly adolescent and immature. The sexual tone seems like it was guided by kids who thought ""talking dirty about private parts"" was the coolest, most grown-up thing in the world. The film fails to accept sex as a natural part of life, instead reinforcing the common American view that the most simple and boring sexuality makes someone a special snowflake. Since the film takes itself so seriously on this subject, it wears thin fast.All in all, only watch this film if you feel like you can ignore its obnoxious style and can glean some small entertainment value from the silly gimmicks. Don't watch it expecting anything legitimately thought- provoking, deep or meaningful.",Being John Malkovich

Not the director's fault though- Spike Jonze's filmography is defined by the offbeat and probably Being John Malkovich could be his most straightforward, or accessible film. But if so was the intention then he could have made this into a more box office friendly film. The drab settings and production design and the bleak outlook dampened the mood.

The concept is certainly unique, but at its core the plot is disappointingly familiar; a self-insert beta male pursues a manic pixie dream girl. The characters are undeveloped, one-dimensional tropes. Their dialogue and behaviour is so jarringly unnatural that it is impossible to relate to them or understand their motives.The film throws in a lot of 'quirks' to amuse the viewer, which are ultimately irrelevant to the plot: the 'half-office', the mishearing secretary, the emotionally scarred chimpanzee. It could be said that these things were added to create a surreal atmosphere, but I argue that it would be better to create this atmosphere with good writing.I was disappointed to be mislead by all these high ratings, but this is sadly another example of an artsy film praised by pseudo-intellectuals.",Being John Malkovich

An absolutely fantastic film, although unconventional, I don't think it qualifies as an art film. Not laugh-out-loud hilarious, but the kind of witty humor that I enjoy.    The movie is worth for its sheer originality, including, my favorite scene, when John Malkovich becomes John Malkovich. It is simply magnificent. Jonze does a brilliant directing job here, although, I would've liked to see something more unique and unconventional to fit the story of the movie. (See Three Kings; which Jonze did a great acting job in) Malkovich is always a pleasure to watch, as is John Cusack.

He existence was so boring, I just couldn't buy people standing in line to pay for their chance at ""John Malkovich."" 5/10 is my vote.",Being John Malkovich

At least it wasn't the nadir of suckiness that makes me reach for the remote and turn it off; there was a tiny shred of curiosity that made me want to see where it went.After it ended I thought it was sort of clever.  But on further reflection I realized that that's what was wrong with it; they were trying so hard to be clever.  It didn't have that innate cleverness that comes from someone who's original and inventive; it was that labored cleverness that makes you uncomfortable and want to turn away and not watch.The main characters (Craig, Lotte, and Maxine) were all completely repellent.  I wonder if it could have been better if they had been made more normal or likable.  As others have pointed out there are so many fixes that the script needed.1 star out of 10.",Being John Malkovich
402,Monellifilms,Original.,9,15 December 2008,"Being John Malkovich is one of the most original movies ever made. Charlie Kaufman takes risk after risk with his screenplay and completely ignores any and all screen writing protocol. The beauty of this movie is that it doesn't try to hammer home a point like Godard or Haneke's movies, rather it is an objective exploration of themes that all resonate with us at some point or another. The self-esteem of Craig is a major theme. He feels awkward as himself, but when he becomes John Malkovich he feels he can achieve anything. The feeling of wanting to be someone else, especially that of a celebrity is something we all have gone through at some point. Everyone wishes that. The film doesn't seem to suggest that is right or wrong, but it explores what happens if it really did. Kaufman's bizarre script has some very imaginative ideas it seems like a fairy tale. His visual ideas are unfiltered. It seems as if Kaufman allows everything from his brain to be put onto paper. Strange fantasies and hopes and ideas that most keep hidden in the back of their mind, Kaufman lets us know we are not alone. Many people have confusion over their sexuality, and Lotte (Craig's wife) is a clear example of that. She falls in love with another woman through being John Malkovich. The film is a great achievement at showing us relationships in a different package. We have seen the typical marriage problems in film over and over again, but Being John Malkovich shows us an odd but fresh new marriage with problems of wanting to be other people, and with other people.",Being John Malkovich
403,nadrojh,Brilliant Movie,10,6 May 2017,"Being John Malkovich is a brilliant movie. Spike Jonz and Charlie Kaufman did an amazing job directing and writing. The movie flawlessly weaves multiple bizarre stories and characters together. The movie was very well shot from the opening scene with the puppets all the way through to the end mixing reality with fantasy. It has a wonderful cast, with great performances by John Cusack, Cameron Diaz, Catherine Keener, Orson Bean, and John Malkovich. Being John Malkovich is one of the many movies that got me interested in movies. It is one of the best movies from the 1990's. It is a complex movie that is fun to watch. Every time I see it I catch something new. It is absolutely brilliant, any body really interested in movies should see it.",Being John Malkovich

The first half of the film is perfect, sophisticated comedy, but as Craig starts to really lose it the laughs drain away to leave what is one of cinema's few philosophical horror films.  The ending seemed one of the most sinister in living memory... 
Overall, I'm left with the same disturbing feeling as I had when watching Terry Gilliam's Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas - that if the film-makers expected to create this sensation the film is marvellous.  If, however, Jonze intended this as a pure comedy (and a great deal of reviewers seem to have taken it this way) then I feel as if I'm dealing with people whose armour of hip cynicism has grown so thick as to rob them of all human sympathy  for their characters.

But as I write this, the movie is listed as #25 in the Top 250 list.  I have absolutely no idea how it can have a rating that high.  It was nowhere NEAR that good.  I've read several other comments here, and a lot of people say what an ""original, and fresh"" story it is. Yeah, it's original, but not GOOD.  I like the premise, but I think they could have done something more interesting with it!  I kept expecting something to HAPPEN, but nothing did.  It seemed to just keep rolling along with no real point to it.  It didn't really seem to have a message or a deep thought for us to ponder.  It didn't even throw me any (interesting) plot twists to make me really care what was going on, or to make me care about what might happen to these characters next.  I did laugh quite a bit, and I liked the 7 1/2 floor bit (especially the hilariously authentic-looking orientation tape explaining the reasons the floor existed.) But I didn't laugh SO much, or find anything about it interesting enough to ever want to see it again.  And I certainly wouldn't give it ""classic"" status.  It was really a let-down for me.  I was really looking forward to seeing it, because I'd heard so many good things about it, and because the story idea sounded so ""original, and fresh,"" but it was absolutely nowhere near what I'd hoped.  I gave it a 4.  If not for the few laughs it did have, I would've rated it much, much MUCH lower.

I didn't even recognize Cameron Diaz in the role of Lotte and was surprised as I could be that it was her. John Malkovich himself completely stole the show, he was absolutely charming and brilliant. I found it a fun movie, but would not recommend it to everyone. If you like a far out concept that toys with the absurd, this is a good movie for you.",Being John Malkovich
411,Greg Lord,You're never truly yourself until you're someone else...,7,17 April 2000,"Weird & Deep  if that's what you like in films you'll enjoy this one; if not, you might as well stop reading now!From 1st-time director Spike Jonze, whose work up until now has been as a director of pop videos, & co-produced by R.E.M.'s Michael Stipes, this is a film which is highly original & hard to classify.Craig (John Cusack) is a puppeteer with a habit of living out his fantasies with puppets made to look like people in his life. Unhappily married to frumpy Lotte (Cameron Diaz as you've never seen her before), he is desperately & unsuccessfully trying to have an office affair with sassy hard-nosed Maxine (Catherine Keener).While looking for a dropped file at work he stumbles across a womb-like tunnel that turns out to be a portal into the mind of John Malkovich (who plays himself). This enables him to experience everything Malkovich does for 15 minutes before being dumped beside the New Jersey Turnpike. When Lotte tries it, she decides she's really a man trapped in a woman's body (or something) & also takes a shine to Maxine. Maxine fancies Lotte too  but only when Lotte is being John Malkovich! Meanwhile Craig discovers he is able to control Malkovich from inside the way he does his puppets, & when Malkovich himself gets involved things really start to get strangeThis is definitely an ideas movie  designed to make you think as much as to entertain. We thought it was largely about Identity; how we define who we are through others - lovers, spouses, children, celebrities  even to the extent of vicariously living our lives through them; & about how we can mercilessly manipulate the people in our lives to meet our own needs. These are however only theories!Despite being somewhat hard to follow & a bit silly in places, I enjoyed this film  it's intelligent, thought provoking & actually very funny. But it is weird!",Being John Malkovich
412,simondajo,"A puppeteer who is constantly misunderstood, finding solace in becoming other people and expressing their feelings, ironically portrayed and extended surreally when he discovers a means of actually BEING som",8,5 January 2003,"The puppeteer is isolated, and tired of his own life, like many of us, and nobody understands him at all; magnified in the filing secretary's constant  and absurd bewilderment at what he is saying. This is not a comedy or a fantasy. It is a drama which gives us insight into something most of us have thought about but found it hard to conceive; the thought of what it is like to be somebody else. Added to this is the puppeteers' skill in learning how to control the character Malkovich, actually becoming himself again but in a different body; all he wants is the name of a star to be able to continue his passion and means of escape. So the means of escape is not being somebody else, its having circumstances to pursue your dreams...we are all hampered in our dreams by achievable things, such as money, or gaining recognition, but we are easily discouraged. So the film is not about being someone else, it is about realizing your potential and achieving recognition.Malkovich comes across as dull and everyday; we see him, through the portal, doing everyday things; such as showering, reading the paper, dating...nothing special. It is only when the puppeteer is in control that we see Malkovich earning recognition...such as the TV report and the standing ovation. To Malkovich acting is just a job; he is nothing like the mysterious, sinister, witty character we often see him playing...when he was asked why he liked acting he gave a very bland, uninspiring reply.The world is full of souls who believe they have no satisfaction in life or creative outlet, unlike the puppeteer, for example those lining up to be somebody else for 15 minutes were looking for brief escape from themselves. Of course we would all like that from time to time, so another theme may be the human condition of being trapped in our own heads; but no magical escape for us. But why would we want to be someone else; even movie stars are basically like us, they simply have work that makes them well known...so the main character's aim is to use this notoriety to his own ends, his OWN. Initially it was a basic animal instinct to have sex with a woman he desired, but he soon realized what this Malkovich face could do for him. So I think the writer is advising us to forget about envying other people, it is not only impossible to be them but even if you were them you would not find fulfillment. Be happy with what God gave you and use what you have to the best of your advantage. The old people regenerating were a symbol of the pathos of wishing to live forever. Seize the day!  Fame is shallow. The real Malkovich was brave enough to demonstrate this fact. He is a good actor, but we are just as good at what we do well, like our friend the puppeteer.",Being John Malkovich

The fact that people buy into it is a testament to how desperately the concept has needed a vessel, but this movie is not it. It's like an artist who is artsy trying to pick on artsy people.

Putting together several bizarre events and story elements, it takes the usual linear narrative structure and confuses it by jumping through time and frequently changing the positions of characters to keep the ending so distinctly uncertain it's hard to imagine what one is waiting for while watching the film. Brilliantly suspenseful, oddly funny, and strangely philosophical (though what this particular philosophy might be is as obscure as anything else in the film) this movie is an odd twist of the typical linear structure of narrative. Rather than reinventing narrative style to find its unique feel, it confuses audience expectations and makes the plot as confusing as the most oddly told stories, but in the most inventive and interesting way.",Being John Malkovich

Striding through it all is an unrecognisable Cameron Diaz, and the (once again brilliant) John Cusack. Yet then it seemed that the initial promise somehow slips away- the film shifts its focus from Cusack's character to Malkovich himself, and the less screen time that Cusack gets, the more the film loses its momentum to (what I considered to be) an unsatisfactory finale. There also seemed an element of over explanation in the final scenes - why not just leave the audience wondering?Still, a brave and original piece of film making all round- script & direction.

419,nintendovi,One Wild Trip,8,26 March 2008,"Even after seeing this movie three times, I am still not sure quite what to think of it. Being John Malcovich is, a thinking movie in every sense of the word, and it brings to light many questions we may have never asked ourselves before watching it. The most paramount of these questions is, ""What is ethical?"" The movie can get cheesy at times, and you'll probably grow to dislike the three main characters since they are kind of crazy. It feels like, by the end of the film, the only person who gives a rat about John Malcovich in this opera of tragedy is you. Of course you could look at the possibility of seeing the world through someone else's eyes from a more altruistic standpoint, but that isn't how my eyes see it.There are some really good camera angles in the movie, and the story itself is pretty interesting, if a bit science-fiction-ish. The acting is good, there's no question about that, and John Malcovich provides a great central character for the events of the story. It's just the whole idea of this 'doorway' and the thought of 'being outside of yourself' that makes this movie original. That, coupled with the powerful acting and visuals, makes this a good movie.I can't really sit here and try to describe 'Being John Malcovich' without spoiling something or going on a rant about the questions it posed to me, this is really just a film you have to see for yourself and think about.

However, Well worth paying full price for, a definite must-see. Spike Jonez will be worth keeping an eye on.

Much of the latter half of the movie seemed to lose focus, and spread itself very thinly over the characters. I was uncomfortable with the whole girl-girl relationship (come on, Hollywood, do we need more twisted stuff like this in movies?

I was pretty sure with this one that I liked it, but I had to think a while what made the movie so clever.   After some consideration, I do not agree that this movie really raises any philosophical questions or provides a new perspective on identity or such things.  Any points where a difficult conceptual situation arises is dealt with more by humor than with wisdom.  But like Brazil and even the Fifth Element, its genius lies directly in its weirdness, and how it simply attacks the stability of one's preconceptions and beliefs in general. After a movie like this, life just doesn't seem so simple any more, so closely bound by rules.  And this movie, I think, does it better than any other. Outrageous plot aside, every character, down to their reactions to each event, is so wholly absurd that it is just too much insanity to process all at once.  But in the end, after a slight change in one's mindset (and perhaps a slight loss of sanity), the nonsense does seem to make quite a bit of sense.  It is impressive that a movie so bizarre could still be so coherently put together.  Many surreal movies, such as some Kubrick and the aforementioned Brazil kind of leave you completely lost at the end, but this one doesn't leave many holes.  I think that just about anyone will leave the movie feeling odd but with no regrets.  As a side note, the acting in all cases is also superb.  For each main actor, it is probably their best performances.  As I said, the characters are so odd, it must have been quite a task to make them seem at all real.  As another side note, the puppeteering is amazing.  If you can do such things with puppets, then I would certainly care to be exposed to more of it.",Being John Malkovich

I found the main characters (with the exception of Malkovich) to be a bit on the unbelievable side.  The transitions that the characters make do not seem to be supported by the story or the dialogue.  The acting jobs were quite excellent (especially Malkovich), but I think that the material was lacking. I think some of the ideas brought up in the film were intriguing, but the film doesn't really delve into them, which is a bit disappointing. (Does everyone have a portal?  Who does?

Broken down into constituent elements its got a lot going for it:  a certainly original story and a well-crafted telling of it; interesting characters well-played by all; and principals we all like to like (the two central Johns especially for me).But what I was quickly left with in this film is: so what?  When you put together all these elements, at the end of the experience are we left with anything that really means anything to anybody?  Not for me.  Frankly, I'm tired of all the nihilism that comes out of Hollywood and tries to pass for art and entertainment -- American Beauty and Pulp Fiction come readily to mind -- go ahead and blast away.  We fool ourselves into thinking that these kinds of films show a maturing of the audience, when, in fact, its only the dumbing down of the audience and vastly lowered expectations that allow these things to be made in the first place.  Just because a movie never could have been brought to an audience only a few years back, because the audience wouldn't have stood for it, doesn't mean those audiences of the past were lacking sophistication.  They just had a finer appreciation for the real meaning of drivel.  You know, it's OK to say something's crap when it is, and even better to be able to say so when just about everyone else says otherwise.The best I can say is that, fortunately, John Malkovich will go right on playing compelling characters in movies hereon out, and I'll be able finally to forget this one.I didn't like this movie very much.",Being John Malkovich

431,bjhomeboy08,One hell of a head spinner,9,3 December 2013,"Have you ever felt like there was more too life than simply what's available. That sense of emptiness you feel, it's indescribable and you can't seem to find a way to fulfill that void. Many of us make that exact claim every single waking day. Whether we're held back by physical obstacles or by our own minds. It's these restrictions that we often try to rationalize that keeps us from exceeding our expectations. But what if you can erase those limitations, start over again, with a helping hand? That is what ""Being John Malkovich"" effectively demonstrates. ""Being John Malkovich"" is truly an awe-inspiring film that desperately tries to define the blurred lines between fantasy and reality. Craig Schwartz, played by John Cusack, is a talented puppeteer who vicariously lives through his dolls, until he is forced into the redundant lifestyle of the generic work culture. However, Schwartz finds something to look forward to, a female co-worker that hooks him and infests his mind and soul. I'll skip forward to not spoil anything, but, Schwartz comes across a worm-hole that allows him to peak through the eyes of actor John Malkovich. Realizing the possibilities that the worm-hole possesses, Schwartz takes his opportunity to hijack Malkovich and become him. The film flies by at around 2 hours and does a consistent job at balancing the fine lines of fantasy, comedy, romance and drama. Overall ""Being John Malkovich"" is a head spinning, self-reflecting piece of art that will peak your fascinations. I came away asking more questions than I intended and that's what makes the film riveting. Although it may not be for everyone it righteously earns it's cult praise and film achievements. A must watch for all film enthusiasts.",Being John Malkovich
432,Philippe277,Whimsically amusing,9,8 May 2011,"This is one of the quirkiest movies I've ever seen, and I love it for that very reason. There are unconventional characters abound, like Craig (John Cusack), a failed puppeteer who yearns for something different in his life, Lotte (Cameron Diaz) a peculiar homely wife who has much the same desires as does Craig, and Maxine (Catherine Keener), a woman whose resolute and blunt nature makes her a perfect seductress to BOTH of the aforementioned characters.I never knew quite where the story was going to go next, which is exactly what I crave to see in movies -- a bit of whimsy. First Craig becomes a file clerk, then he discovers a mysterious portal which, of all things, transports you into the head of John Malkovich. The philosophical ideas that this movie recycles are fascinating: What does it mean to be yourself? Why are so many people so attracted to the idea of being another person, to the effect that they view it as some sort of fantasy ride? And is this identity substitution ethical, given that Malkovich himself was bothered by this phenomenon? And the idea of prolonging one's life through another person -- what does that say about the value of life versus death? For a philosophical mind like myself, Being John Malkovich raises all sorts of intrigue.Craig's magnetic attraction to Maxine is a portrayal of how a large number of people feel who are chained to a marriage. It's human nature to want the forbidden fruit, especially when it's as intellectually challenging and striking as Maxine is. Craig is willing to drop his home-dwelling wife in an instant if he can feel the rush of Maxine's constant presence. And Lotte, perhaps not so coincidentally, is just the same. The main thesis of Being John Malkovich probably is that people will forgo almost anything to be somebody else, even if it's only temporary. People want that new perspective they'd never been able to see, perhaps to see what has changed, and determine what is real and what is slanted through point of view. Craig's working with puppets may be an allusion to this, as he tries his best to emulate other individuals that he knows by creating marionettes resembling them. The film could be a suggestion that in the eyes of humans, existence supersedes identity, as so many are apparently willing to subsist in the limited realm of another person's mind. Whatever the intent of writer Charlie Kaufman may have been, Being John Malkovich is an daring, eccentric adventure that no one will ever forget.",Being John Malkovich
433,dpedal1,One of the most original movies I have seen,9,27 August 2005,"Charlie Kaufman may be one of the most original writers in Hollywood today. Pair him with the unconventional Spike Jonze who is equally as original and you've got one amazing film.Being John Malkovich is about, well, being John Malkovich. Craig Schwartz played by John Cusack, in probably his best role to date, is a struggling puppeteer. He loves his art form but unfortunately it is a dying art form. Lotte, Craig's wife, acted to perfection by Cameron Diaz, is obsessed with her animals. One of these animals is a monkey whom, Lotte swears, is traumatized by his childhood and needs psycho-therapy. The couple seems to genuinely love each even though they are down on their luck. Craig, after some persuasion by his wife and to help with finances, gets a job as a file clerk on the 71/2 floor of the Merton-Flemmer building. It is here that he meets the beautiful Maxine, played by Catherine Keener in a role that earned her an Oscar Nomination from the academy. He becomes a little obsessed with Maxine and she loves the attention from him, although she does not say this we can sense that. After finding a portal to John Malkovich, where you can be him for 15 minutes, Craig and Maxine hatch a plan to charge people $200 a pop to be John Malkovich. From here the story takes off into territory you will never see coming.This is one of the most original movies I have seen. This is a movie that touches on themes that many people ponder but never bring to life. What if I where someone else? How far will I go to seek the approval of others? It also touches on some philosophical themes such as, Am I who I think I am? Craig mentions some of these things after telling Maxine about his first trip through Malkovich. Everyone in this movie is amazing. And this could be everyone's best movie to date. John Cusack, Cameron Diaz, Catherine Keener and even John Malkovich. This is Spike Jonze first feature length film and a welcome one at that. (He earned a best director nomination from the Academy.) I look forward to future projects he will be working on. I highly recommend this movie but I will say it won't be for everyone.",Being John Malkovich
434,ilovemaxel,John Malkovich propaganda,8,13 February 2013,"It seems to me that John Malkovich needed his name out there 'cause no one really knew who he was, even after winning two Oscars, so he wrote a pretty good storyline around his stage persona. Of course, he wouldn't say it was his idea so they said someone else wrote it thinking about him. Yeah, right!The storyline is pretty good, though. Lots of turns you won't expect. The acting, photography and editing are great. I'm not sure the writers where really heading somewhere , or where just toying with the idea of being in someone else's mind (ego, superego, id) while trying to be as outrageous as possible. My bet is they where doing the second one. Anyway, this is a must see and John Malkovich did achieve what he wanted, now everyone knows his name.",Being John Malkovich
435,DaveKerr,Not Quite as Original As You May Think...,1,2 November 2000,"Well, first of I want to make clear that I am a person who is not put off by out there concepts nor am I intellectually devoid. I only point this out as many people seem to think they could be the only reasons why a person could not enjoy this 'masterpiece'. I'm not going to say this film's awful, but I will say it's over rated. All the cast put in a good performance and I particularly enjoyed John Cusack as I usually do yet I felt cheated by this film. Firstly, the concept of delving into someone elses mind in some kind of voyeuristic power trip is nothing new, it has been explored in novels before today, and even video games i.e. Body Rides by Richard Laymon and the game Psychic Detective. I state this to show that the idea behind this film isn't so revolutionary as some may think. In Laymon's Body Rides a bracelet is used to go in the mind of others and, coincidentally, the main character in the story ultimately uses the bracelet to jump into somebody elses mind to escape death. And in Psychic Detective the main character can do the same merely by though. I'm not saying the stories are identical but they do share common ideas. Secondly, I just couldn't relate to the characters, I know they were supposed to be obnoxious but I ended up almost not giving a damn about them as a result of this. However, at this point, I must point out something that did touch me in this film, it was Cusack's character (Craig) who's fate was somewhat undeserved and I felt sympathy for him, his act showing that he did indeed love Maxine, and I also found the thought of Malkovich's daughter becoming the next vessel disturbing as, in essence, Lester/Malkovich/etc was stealing somebody's life. To sum up as a whole, the film did have points where I chuckled or felt something but I ultimately felt denied and I think people should allow other people to think that this film isn't as good as it has been made out to be. In my opinion, if a friend has it, borrow it and see for yourself but don't waste your money on a rental or a DVD, it's just not worth it. Even if you enjoy fringe cinema as I do, you will find no substance in this film to satisfy you, only a huge hollow space around which there is a thinly woven plot.",Being John Malkovich

He somehow acts not as himself, but as others see him.  It's as if he forgets everything he knows about himself and just goes by the stereotype of himself as a ""creepy villain.""Spike Jonze also directs this movie very well and very imaginatively.

Twist and turn, one thing more fantastical than the next, this movie is 100 % UNIQUE. Even the introduction and the setting of the film are outlandish to say the least. The movie develops quickly, plummetting viewers into the warped world it creates; while the surroundings are strange, they are presented without leaving the audience convinced and I found that my questions about Malkovich's mysterious portal, such as ""What happens if John Malkovich goes into his own portal?"", were answered.The directoral work in John Malkovich is quite interested at times as well. Seeing the world through John Malkovich's eyes is not an easy feat to accomplish, but is done tactfully.However, it is the interactions between the characters that fortifies this film. Cuscack, completely smitten by Catherine Keener's character, finds that his love is unrequited. There are more twists in this story, but that's for you to find out, now isn't it?

However, for some reason I started watching this movie again when it came on cable and really got into it. I did not even realize Cameron Diaz was in the movie until I saw it for a second time.

As the movie ended and the credits were rolling, I felt oddly out of place because no one was getting up to leave. Everyone sat there silently just watching the credits for about 2 or 3 minutes.

446,magnoliaX82,Being John Malkovich (1999) [Directed by Spike Jonze],10,5 December 2002,"Yes, it's twisted. Of course its bizarre. But let's not forget that it's also plain brilliant (if it's at all possible for brilliance to be plain). It is simply one of the most unique movies ever made, and it couldn't have come along at a better time. The story is about a struggling puppeteer with an animal-crazed wife (John Cusack and Cameron Diaz, respectively) who finds a portal in his office leading to the mind of John Malkovich. He discovers that by crawling through it, he can actually BE John Malkovich for fifteen minutes, after which he is spat out on the New Jersey turnpike. And if you think THAT'S weird, what happens next will blow your mind: he and the woman he works with -- Catherine Keener in her Oscar-nominated performance -- decide to sell tickets to the portal for $200 a pop. Things go terribly wrong, however, when John Malkovich uncovers the scheme, transforming what was at first a wildly funny fantasy into one of the most thought-provoking meditations on existentialism ever brought to the screen. Because aside from being a comedy, Being John Malkovich has equally tragic parts. The finest example of this concept (SPOILERS AHEAD) is the ending: as Cusack's character is trapped in the sub-conscious of the daughter of the woman he loved, he stares at her and tries to force himself to look away, forever doomed to watch the world through someone else's eyes. It's not just the story and the ending that are great, though; every aspect of the film is fantastic. The screenplay and the direction are perfect (both of which received Academy Award nominations) and the movie itself is truly intriguing -- and strangely re-watchable. While not for everyone, Being John Malkovich is a spectacular piece of work and one of the best films of the nineties.Grade: A+",Being John Malkovich
447,arthurff6,Genuine emotions induced by the story,9,13 November 2011,"One can never doubt, after perceive the name Charlie Kaufman on the screen, that in the following moments your mind will be sagaciously, intellectually and emotionally played. When a man with such talent on writing decides to unleash his artistic sensibility, the result will hardly be ordinary. Being John Malkovich can easily be defined as a modern fairy tale, presenting all distinctive ingredients, such as fantastic yet rustic elements, with whimsical characters wrapped on quick-paced storytelling, all converging to the constant variation of feelings and a possible final insight.Personally, my final classification would be far from the ''comedy'' label that was fed to me before watch the film. It's definitely closer to a horror movie, considering the wretched outcome most characters end up in. Aside from an excellent, really funny scene (''Malkovich!''), the whole movie is a downward path on personage psyche; human flaws, needs, desires and sentiments dealt on a crude manner, represented by the door of becoming someone else. The ending can be considered distressful, when we realize that Malkovich is doomed to perpetuate his existence on the void of his own mind, or Craig Schwartz, emotionally shattered, forced to contemplate other's bliss due to his absence, through a child's eyes.As uncomfortable as the sense of ruthless injustice determined by the final scenes is, it does not count negatively on the experience. Whatever the traces of indignation towards some outcomes may have surfaced, they were genuine emotions induced by the story. And at this particular department, Kaufman never drops the ball, for the exceptional capability of attach us sentimentally to his creation, imprisoning the viewer on the plot. Perhaps it's the identification that every person has regarding egoistical, self-centered and bitter personal characteristics, but the result is that is effective all the time when presented properly.Yes, this movie can touch us this deep; the synergy of characters and situations drag us to a state of reflection as ''Amphibian'' by Björk carry the ending credits, and that state, however glad, melancholic or even just shocked, is a prerequisite for every film to be always remembered closely.",Being John Malkovich

Not the director's fault though- Spike Jonze's filmography is defined by the offbeat and probably Being John Malkovich could be his most straightforward, or accessible film.

449,SomebodyToListenTo,Quite Innovative,10,25 August 2000,"Being John Malkovich is easily the best movie of 1999.  I can understand why some people may not like this movie.  If you don't have a sense of humor, twisted mind or don't like the lines of fiction and reality being crossed you probably won't like this movie.  However, these three elements are the only areas you can fault this movie.  But then again, isn't that is what most movies are about: fantasy?Like Brazil, this movie is highly satirical but it doesn't get too serious. And it doesn't have a blunt message like the former movie.  It is just meant to be enjoyed for what it is.  I guess you could fault the movie for the lack of message but that isn't the point.Jonze has created this whole fantasy world firmly grounded in reality that we can explore through the course of the movie.  Being in John's head is quite an experience.  And then John being in John's head is mind-blowing (I won't spoil it for people who haven't seen the movie).  These elements combined with the 71/2 floor, a pet-obsessed wife and tour scheme make this movie great.This movie accomplished brilliantly what 'The Last Action Hero' failed miserably at.

John Malkovich must be applauded for his outstanding portrayal of 'himself?' possibly one of the more challenging parts I've seen anyone perform.

I was happy to be wrong. The trailer is just a bare hint, unlike so many movies these days where the movie trailer IS the movie (perfect example: Pleasantville).There is so much more to this movie than it's premise, and I won't go over that, there are plenty of sources for finding out the plot of this movie.What I want to comment on is the unoriginal comment everyone's making, how blindingly original this movie is. I sat there, while enjoying the humor and pathos of the characters and the twists and turns of it's incredible plot, wondering how in the world this screenplay was sold to any backers in today's Hollywood!This movie makes you think about the cruelty of fame, the difficulty of acting, (especially with Malcovich the man playing Malcovich the actor playing John Cusack's character) sexual roles and identity, and even immortality!The acting was excellent and it is a truly funny film, and can be enjoyed totally at that level.",Being John Malkovich

I have to single out Cameron Diaz's performance as exceptional as I really could not believe that was her under that gruesome fright wig!P.S.

454,matanovi,Being cheated out of awards.,10,25 April 2000,"Well, the story repeats herself once again. Last year this happened to the unforgetable `The Truman Show' and this year to `Being John Malkovich', probably the best film directorial debut for a video commercial director. What both films have in common is a unique originality, unpredictability and involving, seductive, irresistible subliminal monsterous tone that spoke of big issues in an unrepeatably subtle, and yet direct way.
Obviously, they weren't long enough, or something, for the Academy's taste. I hold that they both deserved the Academy Award for best picture, because that is, I think, the only way American movies have a bright future  if awarding ultraoriginal creations, magnificantly and spectaculary constructed, uniquely written and powerfully and impressively performed. And that's exactly what `The Truman Show' and especially `Being John Malkovich' are.Charlie Kaufman's screenplay has enough originalities for two dozen other movies, but, togather with director Spike Jonze's certainty, they reveal them slowly and neatly, always in a well-argumented manner and with good balance. The plot keeps surprising you from the beggining to the end, never going over the top or losing it's direction.It's hard for me to even imagine how much effort the creators had to put into making this movie, and how hard it was to write it in the first place and then edit all that rough material at the end. I can't remember them failing anywhere, which is very rare in American filmmaking in general nowadays, and when it even happens in a movie like this, it's a miracle.This movie is even so endlessly inventive and unpredictable it kept surprising me even more in the last quarter than in the first or the second one. Or the third one  maybe the most original one. And when even that happens, and when it's not done in a one-invention-on-top-of-the-other-with-absolutely-no-order-or-reason manner, like it isn't here, then you have a great motion picture.`Being John Malkovich' talks wisely, funny and instructively about a lot of subjects that all come from the one in title, and the message is that they should not. Jonze managed to devise a very specific, strange atmosphere that he drags throughout the movie and adapts it to the situations. The result is one of the most stirring movies I've seen in the last few years.An endless number of words could be spilled out about this film. Not one could describe how good it was to me and how truly entertaining it is. Maybe it's not as emotionally moving as his last year's partner in pain `The Truman Show' (both of the movies received best director and best original screenplay nomination, and were deprived for acting nomination  Carrey last year, Malkovich here), but it probably is even a little better performed and better balanced (or edited).Both of them were best pictures of the years they were released in. But obviously not long enough.",Being John Malkovich
455,Tallgent,Farcical Dark Comedy,8,5 March 2000,"If Music Video Auteur, Spike Jonze's first feature-length film is any indication, this will be someone to keep an eye on.  Jonze is to Music Videos what Steven Spielberg is to movies.  Two videos in particular, Weezer's ""Buddy Holly"" and ""Sabotage"" by the Beastie Boys have become classics.  ""Holly"" spliced footage from ""Happy Days"" with Weezer playing in a mock-up of Arnold's.  ""Sabotage"" was a skillful parody of 1970s police dramas a la ""Starsky and Hutch.""  My personal favorite, though, is Bjork's ""Oh, So Quiet"" which was an affectionate homage to Fred Astaire dance musicals.  All of his videos are known for their creativity and visual flair.So one would expect a lot of flair from ""Being John Malkovich.""  Strangely enough, not in this film.  ""Being John Malkovich"" has enough chutzpah and imagination from its very strange story.John Cusack plays a down-on-his-luck, and facial-hair covered, puppeteer named Craig.  In any other movie that may sound like a cliche, but in a hilarious opening sequence, Craig performs a beautiful yet highly erotic puppet show.  And of course the only people watching it are a very traumatized nine-year-old and her outraged father.  Said father then punches Craig.  Our puppeteer hero is married to Lotte, an almost unrecognizable and homely-looking Cameron Diaz.  Lotte is a pet store owner who keeps most of the pets in their cramped apartment.  It seems the young married couple are experiencing financial woes and Cusack must go get a ""real"" job.  Since he's good with his fingers, he gets a job as a filer in an office building....on the 7 1/2 floor.Things get stranger.  The floor has incredibly low ceilings so everyone must spend their time hunched over.  The film does a great subtle job in the weirdness.  Brief reactions of bemusement are given by Cusack, but nothing over-the-top.  Weirdness filters in and out of life after all.  Why do you need to act surprised?  It is on this floor that Craig first lays eyes on Maxine (Catharine Keener) and falls in lust with her.  Maxine is not impressed with our puppeteer and is even less impressed when he tells her his talent.  ""You still play with toys?""Things couldn't get any worse, right?  But they do get weirder.  As Cusack is filing one day he happens across a little door behind a file cabinet. Curious, he enters the door and finds a portal that leads into John Malkovich's consciousness.  Yes, John Malkovich.  Otherwise the title wouldn't make much sense.  The catch is that he can only spend 15 minutes in the body before being spit out on the New Jersey Turnpike.  Why New Jersey? Why not?Later he tells his wife about the metaphysical ramifications about this particular Pandora's door.  She tries it out anyway and finds she enjoys being a man.  Meanwhile, Cusack tells Maxine about the door and she comes across a capital idea of turning in some profit from people who want to be a celebrity.  That distinction is important.  A great running joke of the film is that everyone knows who John Malkovich is but they can't recall any of the films that he has done.  Everyone just wants to be someone else for fifteen minutes.Things get more complicated as each member of our trio wants to use Malkovich for their own means.  Then Malkovich gets wind of the door and enters into his own consciousness.  And if that ain't weird enough, don't worry.  You'll have plenty to go ""Wha?"" about.Kaufman has got his own brand of logic to this illogical story.  There are certain subversions to classic character traits.  For instance, Malkovich the victim comes up with the most logical idea:  Seal the damn door.  But it lasts for only three minutes as his humane plea goes unheard.  I felt sorry for Malkovich the character.  Then there is our hero.  He at first tries the door out, then feels reluctant to share this information citing metaphysical inconsistencies that could prove irreparable.  But when Maxine begins to show interest in Malkovich, Craig goes ahead just to be with Maxine.  In fact everyone in the film is suffering from some form of obsession; even Lotte disregards Malkovich's right to exist as an individual because she wants to complete her self-actualization as a man and consummate with Maxine as Malkovich.That I think prevents this film from being four stars.  The first thirty minutes are farce funny as it piles on layers and layers of strangeness. Then things take a dark turn as Malkovich becomes Cusack's ultimate puppet. I get the sense that nothing went unheeded with detail.  Everything makes sense in the story; nothing is weird for weirdness's sake.The cast does an excellent job.  Especially John Malkovich for allowing himself to be in on the joke.  He seems to be having fun.  Cusack proves himself in another wonderful performance as a nobody schnook-hero who turns into a monster. Keener makes a great bitch.  And Diaz is terrific as a homely wife who finds her happiness by pursuing masculinity in Malkovich.But Spike Jonze provides intelligent restraint.  One can almost imagine what Hollywood would do with a story like this, probably add some computer effects for the portal and the expending on the New Jersey Turnpike. Again, the story is fantastical enough that added effects would underscore the artificiality of the film.  In other words, there is a nice sense of realism in the details.I actually had a nightmare after the film in which I dreamt there was another consciousness dwelling inside me.  So that must say something about what kind of effect it had on me.  The scary thing about ""Being John Malkovich"" is that if there was a way for people to change their identities, they probably would.  The question is would they want to go back.  Would you?",Being John Malkovich
456,Liljan-2,Being John Malkovich: a moral story?,10,21 March 2001,"SPOILER!! Be warned!This is one of my favorite movies; I've watched it several times and it keeps taking on new meanings. Other contributors on this site have found the emphasis on sexuality and lesbianism objectionable, but in my opinion these elements are instrumental in expressing what appears to be an essential moral message. Craig is not satisfied with his life, he wants something more and better. In order to fulfill his dreams, he eats the forbidden fruit (i.e. 'hijacking' John Malkovich), and as a result of his hubris he eventually loses everything, including his wife. His marriage with Lotte - though dull and unsatisfying to both of them - could perhaps have been saved and improved somehow, if it hadn't been for their mutual exploitation of Malkovich.As for the scenes dealing with sex and lesbianism, I find them far less disturbing than the scene in which Craig threatens Lotte with a gun and locks her up in a cage, bound and gagged. Up to that point, I had no problem identifying with Craig and feeling empathy for him, despite his problems and weaknesses.On my scale, this movie gets ten stars out of ten.",Being John Malkovich

The whole tone for the picture was set in the opening scene with the puppeteer manipulating the puppets to perform sexual acts as a child looked on.The whole idea of someone taking over someone else without regard for the other person is also a bit disturbing, and no one seemed to have any regrets about it, so long as they got to get what they wanted out of the deal.

Working as a filing clerk on floor seven and a half, Craig stumbles across a portal into John Malkovich's head. No, really, that's what happens. Anyway, he turns this into a business venture with help from the beautiful Maxine (Catherine Keener), whom he lusts after. Maxine is more interested, however, in his wife, Lotte (Diaz, like you've never seen her before) but only when she's being John Malkovich.
Don't worry if this all sounds a little strange to you, it should do, it's probably the most surreal film ever made. I obviously can't give all the credit for this to director Spike Jonze; Charlie Kaufman is the genius that wrote this insanity. He's the most acutely imaginative and ingenious man of our time.With such a fantastic cast the acting is of course superb; everyone's brilliant, especially Malkovich himself. Well obviously, you say, he's playing himself  yes, but he's also playing himself being played by an increasingly psychotic puppeteer.Monkey flash backs and a restaurant full of Malkoviches are highlights of the insanely brilliant and brilliantly insane movie. If you thought that Spike Jonez could never top the Daft Punk talking dog video, you have never been so wrong in your life.10/10",Being John Malkovich
459,TROLLDADDY,Excellence in Imagination,10,31 March 2008,"I first saw this film while in college. I wasn't much of a critic then(perhaps not now either) and was mostly in to the action flicks where acting and content fell second, or third. This film struck me as an oddity of anything I had previously seen. And most of that is not due to the concept and plot, but the original execution. Different is good. Thought provoking is good. The idea of Being John Malcovich, or anyone else; celebrity or not, is of course no new idea to anyone. The execution this film has to offer; the acting, the philosophical, theological, and idealogical inferences(both divulged in the diologue and those indirect) allows the viewer for much conversation after the film ends.THIS film practically changed my film genre preference. For myself, its one of those films that I show to friends for their personal reactions and as stated, provides good some good post film conversation. If anyone is in for a psychological ""ride,"" put this at the top of your ""to watch"" list. 9/10 TD",Being John Malkovich

Words like original, well-acted, well-written, thrilling, engrossing and hilariously bizarre can't even begin to describe this movie. I had no idea what to expect from this movie, but all I know is by the end I was completely blown away. It's indescribable how huge of a mind trip this movie is. It's one of those movies you simply must see to understand what the hell I'm talking about. Yes, the movie is that good. Yes, the movie is that brilliant.
I can't give this movie anything less than a 10/10. I would say more, but words simply can't do this movie justice. Just see it. You'll know what I'm talking about.",Being John Malkovich
461,eMpTy84,"""You don't know how lucky you are being a monkey. Because consciousness is a terrible curse.""",8,13 April 2017,"This film has a densely layered plot with plenty of insight into the human mind. John Malkovich is a vessel literally and metaphorically. The discovery of the portal amplifies the true nature of each character. Craig, the puppeteer, craves the acceptance of the public for his talent. Lotte, his wife, lives to care for her animals but ultimately wants a child. Maxine, the woman both Lotte and Craig claim to love, believes her beauty is worth the status she lacks. Malkovich is the means by which they believe happiness is possible.Being John Malkovich is very applicable to this digital age of live celebrity updates and involvement with the public. Many wish they were someone who had more freedom to do whatever they wanted in their relationships, profession, and overall life. Craig, Lotte, and Maxine are all out for themselves: seeing Malkovich as an opportunity and not a human being. Walking in someone else's shoes is traditionally viewed as a chance to understand another person, but in this case it is exploited for narcissistic agendas. Only one character in the movie has true compassion for other human beings, and it is Elijah, their pet monkey.",Being John Malkovich
462,bozinovska_jovana,I've never seen anything like this,7,6 August 2013,"Finally, after glimpsing scenes of this movie on TV for 14 years, I decided to watch it. It's something I've never seen before, it's so original and creative. Sure, the main plot - being someone else or being in somebody else's body or mind has definitely been done over the years, but none has been so captivating and thrilling like this one. But, I can't help thinking about this movie as weird. There's so much weird stuff going on. But, that's certainly what makes this movie so beautiful and unique. I couldn't help, but feel entrapped in that world together with the characters, too. Yes, somehow the story is written in that way to make this phenomenon seem so real and natural. Maybe because they took a person from the real world: John Malkovich. His real existence behind the scenes makes us believe more in what is happening in the movie. I also like to compliment the actresses . They were driving me crazy in the most curious way. I can't say that there is something bad about this movie. The ending was so clever and even perfect for me. Because it showed how all good things must come to an end(at least good for someone). Also, worth mentioning is the obsessive love that Graig Schwartz (John Cusack) feels for this one woman. Brilliantly performed by John Cusack. Whenever he was feeling miserable and lost, I was too. About John Malkovich, I can say he was the cherry on top of the cake.",Being John Malkovich
463,lpgprince,...a bad moral lesson.,4,5 December 2013,"The idea of being able to experience all the senses of another person is a quite intriguing thought, combine this with being able to be a celebrity is even better and in this case John Malkovich, being a mysterious and slightly odd guy but still an interesting and famous star provides an attractive juxtaposition, easily drawing the attention from all parts of society.So the title and basic drawing factor of this film is well covered. The characters remain constant and does not feel schizophrenic, although they don't seem to develop either and none of the main characters are easily related to. The film seems to try and center around the frailty of man, but it fails to do so it rather succeeds in centering around a pathetic character in Craig Schwartz and his lustful obsession with Maxine, whom is just a truly rude and unrefined person and then focus shifts to the competition, which the 'love' Lotte Schwartz and Maxine share, provide to Craig's pathetic attempts at keeping Maxine. All of this could have been forgiven if only the audience had been able to relate somehow to those that were in John Malkovich, but there were very little of being in John Malkovich and the audience remained separated from the characters, the main attraction of the story then did not deliver and this almost single handedly steered the film to the side of total disappointment. The story really only accomplishes to cheapen the human condition and Love, it shows no sensitivity to what a life is and what separates lust from love. So although things happen on screen the film seems to only accomplish the opposite of what the puppeteer attempted to express. I almost want to call it a bad moral lesson.",Being John Malkovich
464,ayed,Metaphysical thrillride,10,22 November 1999,"This movie was an amazing experience -- alternately hilarious, perplexing, dazzling, disturbing, surreal, moving, and intellectually engaging (frequently several of these within one scene).  I don't know how to describe the ""plot,"" beyond the bits you no doubt have heard in the press, but I can say that it will take you through an amazing journey in two hours. The superb script challenges your notions of free will, sense of ""self,"" and control -- but without seeming preachy or philosophically dry.  I am amazed that director Spike Jonze has created such a complex and layered work -- but one which is internally consistent -- in his first work that runs over 4 minutes.  The main themes are echoed throughout the film and by each of the main characters.  For example, the idea of ""control"" is taken up with manipulative (sociopathic?) woman who views people as mere instruments to satisfy her desires, several characters who attempt varying degrees of emotional control over their partners, and in the actual and metaphorical ""puppet masters"" at work in the film.It is interesting to note that Jonze and writer Charlie Kaufmann make light of the philosophical dimension to the film by having John Cusack's befuddled character give a confused take on the ""metaphysical implications"" of his first experience ""being John Malkovich"" early in the film.  In a way, this sets the tone for the film, as its creators say: ""this is serious stuff, but don't take us too seriously.""  I encourage everyone to seek out and enjoy the richness of this film.",Being John Malkovich

First The Matrix, then The Sixth Sense, the cartoon The Iron Giant, my favorite movie of all time American Beauty, the raging Fight Club, and now, Being John Malkovich.  Never have I seen such a creative concept for a movie.  And the entire series of plot twists that make the entire movie one huge jumble of plots and stories.  And right at the center is John Horatio Malkovich.The story is so original and absurd it is hard to believe anyone could think of it:  A puppeteer/file clerk finds a doorway into John Malkovich's head, in which you can see the world through John Malkovich's eyes for fifteen minutes.  The clerk teams up with a beautiful coworker, who his wife ends up falling in love with.  And the coworker loves the wife-when the wife is inside of John Malkovich.

Flying out of a fantasy to find oneself on the shoulder of the freeway. Yep, may happen. The violence that didn't quite happen in an already lost relationship was the tensest part of movie for me.

468,Thalor-2,I just did not get this movie.,3,1 December 2005,"Most of John Cusack's films I enjoy. He is very good in comedies, drama, and action films.I find him an incredibly funny actor. His ability to wear a deadpan expression after delivering an incredibly funny line is amazing. He comes across as very sincere. It makes it easy to empathize with his characters.My whole problem was with the plot.The premise of the movie was just too weird for me to get into. To say it was surrealistic is to put it mildly.I realize that the idea of the movie was to take a a sort of absurdly improbably ""what if"" and fully explore that idea.In that respect, I think it does a good job.It explores the implications of this possibility with admirable depth and detail. The actors play their characters believably - even if the plot itself is pretty unbelievable.I enjoy science fiction, horror, and fantasy films. I realize, honestly, that most of these films plots are completely or at least mostly implausible as well. However, in watching them, I feel a sense of ""suspension of disbelief"" that I just did not experience with this movie.I realize this film enjoys cult film status. It is just not the cult for me, I am afraid.I watched this film at home, when I was by myself. Maybe that was part of the problem.I do sort of imagine this film could be more enjoyable if you watch it with a group of friends - especially at home, not in a theater. Then you could exclaim about one bizarre scene or speculate about what will happen in the next.A group of close friends, in a very relaxed, informal, rowdy atmosphere - who enjoy a taste for peculiar movies - could probably get pretty into it.",Being John Malkovich

The chase scene through Malkovich's subconscience, the chimpanzee's flashback to the jungle, and of course, Mr. Malkovich's trip to his own mind (I couldn't breathe, I laughed so hard)--all some of the most odd scenes I've ever seen.And yet, as novel as the story of becoming John Malkovich for 15 minutes at a time sounds, it really plays well--not just as a gimick, but as a vehicle to tell a love story (a very very odd love story).  Never once did I mutter ""This is stupid--that can't be done."" The writer and director (I can't believe it was Spike Jonze!) simply make us accept the fact that these people can enter the mind of John Malkovich...the rest just unfolds around that.(Best Original Screenplay?)Oh yeah, and the puppetry was beautiful, too.",Being John Malkovich

The premise itself was original at first, but after Cusack, Diaz and Keener kept landing on the side of the New Jersey Turnpike over and over again it got pretty silly. Cusack and especially Diaz (surprise!) played their roles well.  Keener has been good in other pictures but she basically played a one note character here and didn't impress me much.  The various gimmicks, such as the 7 1/2 floor, the portal, the really dumb gag with Mary Kay Place mishearing everyone, were really nothing to rate this as some kind of film masterpiece. John Malkovich was self-deprecating and he really lifted this picture when he arrived on the scene.

477,simply peter,"Original, but not really good",5,10 July 2000,"One of the great things about storytelling is, that you are absolutely free. There are no limits to the imagination. Whatever you can think of - in your story it can happen. Unfortunately filmmakers do not very often make use of this unlimited freedom. Most of the movies made these days are just variations of stories that have been told in other movies before.Every now and then, however, someone has the courage to be original. All it takes is one good idea. That idea does not necessarily have to make great sense - on the contrary! A really weird idea can be the foundation for a really interesting film. Like: ""What would happen, if all the birds suddenly started to attack people?"" (as in ""The Birds""), or: ""How would it be, if you had to live through the same day over and over again?"" (as in ""Groundhog Day"").In ""Being John Malkovich"" that basic idea is: ""Imagine, you would find a gate which leads directly into the brain of John Malkovich."" Very original, very weird, very promising!Unfortunately this time the result falls short of what might have been. The opportunity sure was there. With a setup like this the outcome might have been a hillarious comedy, an exciting thriller, perhaps even a spooky horror-movie. It became neither. Somehow the author could not come up with enough good ideas to give the film the tempo it needed. All the twists and turns that could and should have been in the story are amiss.One more reason, why this film fails are its characters. I am not talking about the actors here - they are good. But the people they play are not. To really get into a movie like this, audiences need a focal point. A character, they can identify with - the ""hero"" if you like. Who is that supposed to be here? In the beginning it might have been Craig Schwartz . Professionally unsuccessful, a little bit naive and with some kind of stubborn pride. All in all quite likable - even in spite of his clumsy attempts to cheat on his wife with Maxine , who is a bitch if there ever was one. As the movie goes on, however Craig becomes increasingly mean. He does things, that we feel, we would not do, and thus loses us on the way. And lost we are now, for there is no other potential ""hero"" to turn to. Maxine is still the bitch, and Lotte is simply to whacky for anybody to identify with her. What happened was: before the supposedly dramatic climax of the story I had ceased to care, for whom there would be a happy ending and for whom there would not. And that is a perfect foundation for being bored. (5/10)",Being John Malkovich

I especially enjoyed the cameo by Charlie Sheen toward the end.Do not take the message of this movie lightly.  It will and should move you to question your own consciousness and mortality.  The fate of John Malkovich almost moved me to tears.  His desperate cry for joy, ""I'm free, I'm free"" is quickly muffled by the onslaught of unwanted puppeteers.

However, it's a great film because of its extremely original plot. But let's just say, If I ever had the idea of writing this script, I would never imagine it would make it to Hollywood! I must admit I was somewhat disappointed as I was expecting a lot more from this overrated movie. The lesbianism involved in the movie was developed to a point in which it destroys the creative main plot of someone being inside John Malkovich's head. The fictitious environment lead by Orson Bean is very well unfolded in the end which added a lot to this movie.

Struggle, belonging, feeling alive, hopes and dreams. It touches them in a close and personal way.For the first 30 minutes of this film I thought it was reaching depths of truth and shining a mirror up to us all in a beautifully strange way, and with humour and heart. If it had continued on that arc it would be a 10/10.I loved the tiny ceilings of Lester corp and the surreal office place set up. It nails what the culture of corporate america actually is, a strange compartmentalised faction of reality.The negative: I just didn't like the love triangle arc that it ended up taking - I don't know what it was trying to show. There was no growth of character there was no complex conclusion. You could think about the set up of the film as being an ingenious way to explore this being questions about what it is to be being human, but then it almost felt like the set up devices ended up taking away from the human questioning side. Plot stole form meaning.Still, a dazzling film and I feel a bit mean giving it a 7.",Being John Malkovich

But I can't help feeling that that does not help. I'm not very fond of the story in particular.

He is a real character.But what the movie really showed me was the fact of being someone else, anybody else I mean, and how can we get if we find the way to be that someone else no matter who that person might be. How ridiculous do we become, as if we are always prisoners of our own destiny, how boring do we think our lives are that we are willing to give it all away just to be born again as someone new an supposedly better than us. It is a funny movie and yes, we can say a little strange, but it is human nature in the most coarse expression.

483,primate45,Great for thinking. LOTS of fun.,9,23 April 2006,"Bizarre. That's the first word that came to my mind as I reflected on this film. Indeed the most common muttering that I heard among my friends with whom I was watching the film (who, I admit, had no idea what they were going to be watching and had never heard of the film) was: ""what the f**k??!!"" I kept my incredulity to myself, but I largely shared their sentiment. It's a film about being John Malkovich (surprising, huh?). A man struggling to make ends meet as a puppeteer finds a job filing things on floor 7 ½ of a building which happens to be half a floor where everything is miniaturized, and all the people working there have to stoop. He discovers a small door that leads directly to the inside of John Malkovich, where you can be him for 15 minutes, after which you fall from the sky onto a spot pleasantly situated next to the New Jersey turnpike. Soon the puppeteer and a coworker (with whom he is in love, although he is married) start charging admission to regular schmoes who want to be someone else for fifteen minutes. A bizarre love triangle develops between the puppeteer, his wife, and the coworker, and somehow John Malkovich is worked in there as the puppeteer and his wife vie for time being him, so that they can then be with the coworker. Now before this plot gets any more convoluted and confusing to the unknowing reader, I'm going to forgo the growing plot and I'm going to jump to the meaning and the profundity of the film (which is actually the most fun part!).This film tackles one of the most existentially challenging and profoundly interesting and intense enigmas of humanity. What is the essence of self? Is it possible to see the world through someone else's eyes, and yet remain oneself? If you are someone else for a time, then what are you replacing, and what happens to that whom you've replaced? And what happens to your body if you've left yourself, to be someone else? Strangely enough, this film seems to answer all these questions, in as strange a manner as any other answer could possibly be. It puts forth a logical (well, almost) system in which one can be someone else, and it provides for any question the viewer could have about the process. It even raised a question that I had not even thought of, and answered it itself. What happens when a person is himself? That is, what happens when John Malkovich goes through the door to himself? Well, suffice it to say that the result blew my mind, and was hysterical at the same time. It was a very bizarre answer, but as good an answer as any other!This film is like nothing I've been exposed to before. I keep repeating at the ends of my reviews that if a film doesn't make you think, it's not worth your time. That still holds true for this film, perhaps even more than any other, but not like any other I've seen before. Other films have messages about life. They teach the viewer something about life, or some way to live, or something the director or writer has learned that he wants to impart unto the viewer. This film does that as well, and more. It does blatantly warn of the troubles involved with wanting to be someone else. The whole concept of being another person is simply impossible, and only a dream, as evidenced by the dream-like setting of the little door: a floor half the normal size. However this film was more than a life lesson. It simply makes you think. And that's fun. It proposes a philosophical puzzle, and proposes a genuinely entertaining solution. However attacking a philosophical puzzle such as this one is seemingly impossible to do on film, short of showing three older men in smoking jackets amiably discussing the issue over sherry in front of a blazing fire. Therein lies evidence of the immense skill involved in making this film. Another remark that I heard from a friend as we watched the film was ""what kind of a person thinks of this stuff?"" The answer is: a genius. Truly, only a person of extraordinary thought and inventiveness could imagine such a film. Furthermore, great film-making was employed as well. I still can't figure out how they filmed things through Malkovich's eyes. I suppose they could've taped a camera to his head. But that doesn't explain how Malkovich looked at himself in the mirror, with no place for a camera to hide. Regardless, it was pretty fancy camera work. In fact the camera work was quite masterful for much of the film, as things became mentally tumultuous.However the crowning jewel of this film, as I've mentioned before, is the writing: both the story/plot and the dialogue. The characters are so odd, the story so strange and the dialogue so out there, that one can't help but enjoy this film! It is meant to be a comedy, and it certainly is one. The oddness and awkwardness just make you laugh. I nearly forgot to mention the fascinating performances by all the actors in the film. Particularly the awkward puppeteer played masterfully by John Cusack, and his eccentric wife, played surprisingly well by Cameron Diaz. And how could I forget John Malkovich himself, who does an exemplary job playing himself, and playing well, himself, but possessed by another. This is really a fun movie to watch, to think about, and discuss. The makers, especially Spike Jonze and Charlie Kaufman, and the entire cast and crew deserve a firm pat on the back, and all those who haven't seen it deserve a firm word of encouragement. Go see this film, and be prepared to exclaim ""what the f**k??!!"" And remember, if it doesn't make you think, it's not worth your time.-Michael",Being John Malkovich
484,dmconnor,The first really intelligent comedy I've seen in years!,10,29 October 1999,"The first time I saw a trailer for this movie, I knew it was going to be something special.  The film itself is nothing short of brilliant.  It's fresh, funny, surreal, appealing, and intelligent.  In a day when the big-grossing comedies are more likely to be gross than big, this is a welcome change.John Cusak is really marvelous, in that instead of his usual clipped and polished look, he is bedraggled and pathetic... but retains his appeal. Catherine Keener gives a wonderful comic performance, using throwaway lines, and even the odd gesture, to pull belly-laughs out of the audience.  John Malkovitch is a great sport, willing even to poke fun at the fact that, while he is a superb actor, he's not all that well known.The stars of this movie, though, are the director and the screenwriter. I've always thought that the stage was a better medium than film for the truly surreal, because in the theatre, actors can rely more on the participation of the audience to fill in the blanks. Film is a much more literal medium, so the burden is on the director to present an image that answers questions as quickly as they are posed.Jonze transcends this convention, allowing the actors to tell a rather bizarre story, while demanding that the audience pull its own weight.  I was totally drawn in, and I loved every minute of it.  Usually a story this unconventional requires a lot of special effects to be credible, but here they are at a minimum.  Almost anyone these days can make a fantasy film out of digital artistry, expensive sets, and bad acting, but it takes a great director and a stellar cast to make a first-rate fable with just actors and a camera.",Being John Malkovich

486,atroyz,Best Film of the Year,10,18 March 2000,"An amazingly hilarious and undeniably strange film, BJM was perhaps a little too ""out there"" for Academy members, but it was without a doubt the best film of '99 in my book. I cannot recall ever laughing harder in a cinema than I did in the scene in which Malkovich enters his own portal. The film's ideas, scenery, and cast all make for an undeniably fresh look at cinema, and the casting of Malkovich was destiny.  He's the last person you'd expect to star in the comedy of the year, and perhaps that's why the film works so effectively. I've tried to explain this film to my friends in Germany (I saw the film in California, while visiting in winter, and  BJM won't be out here until may (!)) yet I wish I had never tried to explain it.  It can't be explained, nor should it be! I have also bought Carter Burwell's score...brilliant!  I can't see why that wasn't nominated for best score.  It's the richest, darkest, and therefore most original piece of music ever set to a comedy, and it adds a completely new layer to the film.  I recommend this film to anyone who thought the Oscar nominations were a bit thin, and to anyone who is tired of ""cookie cutter"" hollywood productions that are either sequels, remakes, or films that SEEM like sequels and remakes (Double Jeprody?  Green Mile?  You've got mail?  Runaway Bride? Boiler Room?  Why don't we just call these movies ""The Fugitive in a Dress,"" ""The Shawshank Magic Man,"" ""Meg and Tom III,"" ""Pretty Woman got Married"" and ""Wall Street Jr.""??)  Spike Jonze obviously couldn't take anymore monotony, and made BJM. Thank God he did.",Being John Malkovich
487,ickyptang,Just terrible,1,26 February 2000,"Hailed as one of the best movies of the year and even by some as one of the best in the decade, ""Being John Malkovich"" feels more like it was barely given any effort at all.  The film begins somewhat quirky and almost promising, and the viewer knows it is in for something very different. The premise also has to be given credit for originality, dealing with people being transported into the mind of John Malkovich.  But it is all down hill after the first twenty minutes.  Ridiculous in it's pace, the film is trying to create a new genre, but fails miserably.  It also constantly dares the viewer to accept this bizarre land, and toys with their head.  It almost makes the viewer feel they have to like it, because if they don't then they aren't open-minded or intelligent enough to live.  When really the script is just stupid.  The premise goes nowhere and all the seemingly great ideas proposed fall flat and are dull.  Not to spoil, but the idea proposed of what would happen if Malkovich tried to enter his own head is the most disappointing of all.  And Jonze's direction is as flat and bland as sugar-less cotton candy.  The actor's are all forced to act like idiots, instead of molding and creating a character.  All of the stars are talented, but their time is wasted with Jonze who is just trying to be too hip for his own good.  So in the end,the viewer is left with a story that went no where and an almost acidic trip into nothingness. It seems today's critics are trying to appear on an elevated level, far more intelligent than the common man, by loving this film. While a dud like ""Drop Dead Fred"" had more charm than this garbage.",Being John Malkovich

I JUST finished watching this film from iTunes rentals. Ohmygoodness. The entire film is so beautiful. But a very different kind of beautiful. One I cant compare anything too. It is ironically beautiful like Stranger than Fiction. It is desperate. It is selfish. Just wonderful.The plot is amazing, a puppeteer discovers a way to be John Malkovich. He is unhappily married to a selfless bride yet he is attracted to a selfish sensual coworker.The Characters are each memorable and play so well. The best performances in any movie I've seen. I didn't recognize Cameron Diaz. I didn't know she could act - she plays someone selfless yielding to others. She's wonderful. I didn't think during the movie that she was Cameron Diaz. I thought she was Lottie. I still do. She became someone else disassociated from herself which is extraordinary. John Cusack is also wonderful as ultimate desperation. Catherine Keener (I usually hate her) but I loves and respected her as the ultimate selfish bitch. John Malkovich was given something INSANELY difficult. He had to play himself as a part. He was himself in an actor's part. Yet he also had to play himself being manipulated by someone else. Imagine playing yourself but being controlled by your mom. And he does a wonderful excellent job. He captures the essence of the person playing him.WATCH IT. My favorite film. So unique. So different. Makes you realize how desperate and willing the human condition is.",Being John Malkovich

494,mrpink000,A brilliantly original piece of fictional film making,7,20 January 2004,"From the creators of Adaptation and Confessions of a Dangerous Mind (Director Spike Jonze and writer Charlie Kaufman), Being John Malkovich is a splendid and incredibly original film which on top of the unique script boasts an all-star cast (John Cusak, Cameron Diaz, Catherine Keener and John Malkovich).The plot is unique and complex and centers around the life of Craig Schwartz (John Cusak), an unemployed and unsuccessful puppeteer. His simple, modest life takes an abrupt and confusing turn when he accepts a job as a file clerk on the 7th and a half floor of an office building in NYC. Here he becomes obsessed with a co-worker, Maxine (Catherine Keener) and starts to fantasize of a romance with her, despite his marriage (to wife Lotte (Cameron Diaz)).Things become even more strange and complicated when Craig discovers a portal in his office, which, when entered, takes you into the head of famous actor, John Malkovich (playing himself). From here on in the the lives of Craig, Lotte and Maxine become entwined, complicated and very strange as they attempt to work out the best possible solution for their own problems, needs and desires. Being John Malkovich is one of the most brilliant, original and unique films of the last decade, if not of all time. Kaufman's script combined with Jonze's directing is the perfect match and compliments each others unique way of story telling, pushing all the boundaries of fictional story telling and creating an utterly compelling and clever film. An excellent film - 8/10!",Being John Malkovich
495,campbellrc1,In Two Minds,6,10 April 2004,"I'm in two minds about this film. (Pun intended.)After the first ten minutes I wanted to switch it off because I couldn't get into it.  Puppets?  Who cares about puppets?  I hate puppets!And animals too!However, I stuck with it and I'm kind of glad I did.Why?Well, apart from Catherine Keener, who I thought was knockout in every way, the concept was really interesting and as soon as John Malkovich appeared on the screen in the flesh it became riveting.It's so good to see a major star being prepared to make fun of himself and his status (Charlie Sheen too -- loved the combover!), and I really wanted to know how the story would be resolved.However, I'm not sure I liked the way it developed. It became an uneasy mix of satire and science fiction, and I think one of those genres would have been better than two.I also like it when I can identify a theme in an art movie -- this one was presumably about identity and knowing who you are -- but the message got lost in the medium.  (But then didn't some producer like Sam Goldwyn say that if you want to send a message, use Western Union?)So like I say I'm in two minds about it.

496,elisa_jenkins-65819,Best Surreal Experience ever captured on film,10,18 February 2018,"Where to start? The coolest conceptual story to come around in decades. Kaufman is a sheer genius, tying in philosophical quandaries with dark caustic humor and fanatical elements like no other. Spike Jonze brings this script to life, formulating a perfect storm of imagery and powerful performances. It speaks to everyone, as you will identify with at least one of these tortured characters. Casting Cameron and Cusack as these frumpy fops is brilliant as well, and they both give the best performances of their careers, playing against type in a magnificent display of grotesque beauty. And who would have thought the ending could be so poignant, tragic, and satisfying at the same time. What a damn roller coaster ride of imagination. Also, nice nod to surrealist Alfred Jarry, with the ""half a floor"" joke (he famously made his apartment like this for some baffling reason. LOVE THIS FILM.",Being John Malkovich
497,r00fus,Just ok.,6,10 December 1999,"This film tries to be existentialist, but is too watered down with a substandard plot and uninteresting characters. Basically, it fails to entertain. Most of my friends who went also yawned afterwards... and I really wanted to like this movie. Also the sexual subplot is just jarring (I didn't expect it, and it didn't fit)One good thing is the acting by JM, as I actually felt the prescence of Cusack's character when he inhibited Malkhovich.

It is not at all just simply a comedy, but an intelligently done genre defining movie that is wickedly funny, disturbing, absurd, and even sad. What makes it even more interesting is how all the characters are not phased by the absurdity around them. Most people would make a big deal about a building with a 7.5 floor, and strange portals into actors minds that drop us off into the NJ Turnpike. Yet, the character take it as it comes, as if it is a very interesting turn in their lives. Perhaps they are unique because of the rather strange lives they lead.Enough about absurdity.

But when it comes down to it, you don't really know that much about the plot until you actually get into the theater, and that just makes the movie that much more wonderful.

Its surrealism makes Monty Python (or even Bunuel) look like the most reasonable of all people. It is said that BJM is a metaphore about our urge to become someone else.

I don't like the way it presents important philosophical concepts, and I didn't think the movie was so mind-blowingly original as people made it out to be.

That didn't necessarily translate into a film I thoroughly enjoyed, however.I found the acting lackluster (with the exception of Malkovich as himself, the unwitting participant), and was not terribly impressed with Spike Jonze's directorial debut.  With a story the calibre of this one, having either of those facets of the picture being particular high-quality would have warranted a high rating.  As it is, I gave the film a 6/10, based upon the storyline, which I found fascinating, and Malkovich's performance, which is a howl.",Being John Malkovich

But while the idea of a portal into someone's mind is certainly interesting, Being John Malkovich contained virtually no character that I had any emotional connection to at all.  None of the main characters are likeable, and the movie really starts to go downhill after the novelty of the portal wears off.  The best acting performance, by far, is John Malkovich, and I like the fact that he was willing to poke fun at himself. But, overall, I just think this is a very detached movie and certainly not deserving of the top 50 all-time rating it has on here right now.  If you're looking for a unique film with some characters and situations to care about from 1999, check out Three Kings instead.",Being John Malkovich
506,paulmartin177,Malkovich? Malkovich! MALKOVICH? MALKOVICH!,8,18 May 2006,"This is a wonderful and truly strange film, and perhaps the strangest thing about it is that it got made at all given today's Hollywood film system. The story concerns an unhappily-married, unsuccessful puppeteer (played by John Cusack), who discovers a hole behind a filing cabinet in an office block which leads 'into' the (actual, real-life) American actor John Malkovich. Those who go down this hole are then transported into Malkovich's identity and/or brain (it's difficult to explain it exactly unless one has seen the film!) for a few minutes, and then dropped out onto a nearby highway! You'd think that this would be enough to guarantee a film of tremendous originality, but there is so much more weirdness and imagination in this film that one's interest is sustained throughout. For example, the floor of the office in which this hole is discovered was deliberately built for midgets, so that anybody of normal height has to bend over to avoid hitting their head on the ceiling! The reason for this is 'explained' to the puppeteer (who lands a filing job there) in a short film for new recruits, although we (and they) are none the wiser after seeing it. Eventually Malkovich himself ends up going down the hole, resulting in one of the most bizarre and disturbing (and funny) moments I have seen in a film. What he encounters is a world (or at least a restaurant) populated entirely by John Malkovichs: men, women, babies...! This could so easily have been a completely pretentious and confusing shambles of a film, but the director (the brilliant Spike Jonze) handles things with such focus and style that one is eased comfortably into the semi-fictional universe presented. I think what make the film work is that it manages to be both surreal and very ordinary at the same time: some of the lead characters are deliberately rather shabby and dull in their appearance (Cameron Diaz in particular), and the scenes in which we the audience see the point-of-view of whoever is inhabiting Malkovich are very mundane (and strangely touching, I found), such as washing up, ordering crockery over the phone or eating toast. The whole visual style of the film is very drab and slightly under-lit, which serves to emphasise the far more bizarre aspects of the actual story. Credit must also go to Charlie Kauffman, who wrote the screenplay. Wonderful stuff.",Being John Malkovich

The concept was excellent and I love movies with an unusual story. I watched it with several house-mates, most of which left the room before I stopped the movie.I was appalled by the shallow characterisation, the lack of any comedy, in fact the lack of any endearing quality whatsoever. Some scenes were such a cacophony (the chimps in particular) that it suggested the film had been constructed from outtakes.All in all, 'Being John Malkovich' is an incredible waste of a concept and talented actors - a film so unlikeable that it's practically offensive.To all those reviewers that bigged up this dog of a movie -- you wasted an hour of my life - you suck!",Being John Malkovich

John Malkovich gives an excellent performance- despite playing himself his character is very different to the real man and is great when playing himself being controlled by other characters (Craig and Dr Lester). This film also has one of my favourite twist endings of all times and left me surprised for quite a duration. Jonze provides a great piece of art (with some cringe moments) that baffles me to how his mind comes up with these fantastic ideas. Lastly this film is VERY underrated, obviously having its flaws- like most films, it does not have the well deserved rating it should have.",Being John Malkovich
514,jebediah-72668,"Original almost to the point of inaccessible, but what else do you want?",8,2 January 2019,"The really surprising thing about this utterly original film is that it's not based on a novel. The premise, the dialogue, the tone and the switcheroo plot all appear to have come together fully-formed in this Charlie Kaufman screenplay, rather than adapted or distilled from a long and complex existing work. I got to a third in and found myself thinking, ""I bet the novel's great, wonder who wrote it?""
It took me decades to get round to watching this, and I enjoyed it enormously. Cusack and Diaz are having a blast cast against type, and Keenan is a femme fatale of a type we've never seen before. In his intensity, Cusack seems to be channelling his sister Joan's up-tightness. In fact, I found myself thinking ""who is he reminding me of here?"" and it was Ros Mullins in 'School of Rock' (which came out wa-ay after this). Diaz has never been better, her self-realization post-Malkovich experience is hilarious and compelling, as is the three-way dinner date with Craig and Maxine.
In the surfeit of ideas - such as making Craig an unemployed puppeteer with nimble fingers ideal for filing, the history of Floor 7 and a half, and the transformation of Malkovich from actor to puppet maestro - inevitably there are some misses. The ending particularly disappoints, but hey, with such low overheads, they pass on the savings directly to you!
The film's extraordinarily 'meta' conceit, that John Malkovich plays John Horatio Malkovich, and also plays Craig Schwartz as John Horatio Malkovich is at once mind-bending and believable, but perhaps it could have been Tom Cruise after all. It's a good performance and a brave one, but apparently it all comes down to the way the syllables of 'Malkovich' sounded to Kaufman, and who are we to argue?

There was this puppet show. I tried again another day, and discovered one of my all-time favorite movies. My all-time favorites don't necessarily include all-time favorite performances, but this one does. Catherine Keener is inspired and perfectly entertaining as the quirky, kinky, love-interest for ultimate-loser John Cusack. I'm certain there's never been a movie like this before, and it stands repeated viewing in a completely unique way. Cameron Diaz is virtually unrecognizable as Cusack's neurotic wife. Orson Bean (you read correctly) is sublimely cast in a crucial role. John Malkovich is hilariously flabbergasted at what's going on, whatever it is. This is not a comedy, just outrageously hilarious.

517,Cal_52,Completely innovative and entertaining!,9,29 July 2000,"""Being John Malkovich"" is unlike any movie that I, and probably you as well, have ever seen.  A crazy, comedic, fantasy that finds Craig Schwartz (John Cusack) fiddling with the mind of the well-respected actor John Malkovich. Craig finds a portal into Malkovich's mind in his office where you can see through his eyes for 15 minutes and then be dumped out onto the New Jersey Turnpike.  He markets this new concept of ""being someone else"" with the help of his co-worker Maxine (Catherine Keener) who he falls madly in love with. At the same time Craig's wife Lotte (Cameron Diaz) discovers the profoundness of herself through the portal and also falls madly in love with Maxine.  It's a crazy, messed up story, that will keep you hooked to the screen to see what wild events will take place next.  Writer Charlie Kaufman has woven such a complex idea and concept into such an entertaining and imaginative story that director Spike Jonze brought to life.  In his big screen directorial debut, Jonze takes us right into the mind of John Malkovich along with the other characters and brings out the strangeness and innovation of Kaufman's screenplay.  The entire cast turns in wonderful performances, especially John Malkovich himself.  I'm sure it wasn't to much of a stretch for him to play, well, him, but he does it with such subtlety that it makes all the fantasy seem like reality for the viewer (due in large part to Jonze's directing as well).

521,3p,overrated,7,23 July 2001,"Sorry. But I'm another among people who can't understand what's so great about this movie. I am a kind of sci-fi/fantasy fan, but if this movie is sci-fi, it's crap. Ideas are neither consistent nor explained or believable. Why does person have to enter 'vessel' before certain time? What happens if more people enter same 'vessel'? Etc. Add main characters' love affairs and you get an artsy version of contemporary soap opera. Nice to watch, relax, eat pop-corn while it's on, but nothing more. :] 6/10. And I'm very generous.",Being John Malkovich
522,wraith-5,Would make a better Twilight Zone episode than a feature film,5,22 October 1999,Being John Malkovitch was not excellent.  My overall recommendation is to see it to appease your curiosity. It is intriguing and well done but it runs slow at times and would make a better twilight zone episode than a feature film.,Being John Malkovich
523,Robert-114,"Good Start, then totally boring!",6,21 November 1999,"The script seemed fairly creative and the opening puppet show gave me a lot of hope for a great film.  However, it slowly went down hill as the story went on.  Ultimately, it didn't have much to say.  Just tired old jokes worked over and the feeling of being just another Hollywood type film. By the end I was really bored and quite happy when it came to an end.  It's not a bad film compared to others out there now.  Yet, it held out hope for something more and didn't carry through.  Yawn!",Being John Malkovich
524,flip6,Being on top of it!!!,10,20 October 1999,"First things first, Lets all applaud Spike Jonze and Charlie Kaufman for creating such an incredible and original piece of film. Second, lets give props to all the actors, especially Cameron Diaz, for showing diversity with roles none of them have ever done before, (even Malkovich gives a superb performance as...well...himself). It's so refreshing to see a completely new and original film. The movie is full of non stop laughs. Laughs that are not over the top to the point of stupidity, all though there are times where it is appropriate, but laughs that are still laugh out loud funny. I couldn't help but feel like I was watching a real good Terry Gilliam film. 'Cause even the far-fetched seemed believable in this movie.

525,PElivs,DISAPPOINTING,10,1 January 2000,"People say you either love or hate this film but as far as I can see it's not interesting enough to warrant either feeling from me. Rarely have I seen a film that has received such high accolades from reviewers that in reality is only average and mildly entertaining. I wondered if I had just watched the same film as everyone else. From the underdeveloped and miscast 2-dimensional characters (Particularly Catherine Keener & John Cusack) to the tasteless and pointless lesbian love triangle subplot, there was simply too many flaws in a film that had so much potential. BJM could have been an intriguing insight into the subconscious of the human mind and an analysis of human psyche but falls short on both counts. I can only wonder what this film could have been in the hands of a genuine director, as opposed to an amateur music video director like Spike Jonz. I wanted to like this film, just as so many who found ""Malkovich"" lacking. As it stands, it's nothing more than average entertainment for the everyday masses. SCORE: 4/10.",Being John Malkovich
526,bart88,Wacky but Great!!,9,21 November 1999,"Being John Malkovich was one of the most entertaining movies I have seen this year.  It is definitely in a category of its own.

There was a weird approach to the movie and I had this weird feeling throughout the whole movie, but it was a comfortable feeling.  Go see it!!!!",Being John Malkovich
527,Fantom-3,"'Malkovich' is eye candy, in the least likely place",10,16 November 1999,"Being John Malkovich' is one of the most ingenious, creative, and bizarre movies that I've ever seen.  There is never a tedious moment in the film. Charles Kaufman creates an utterly original heap of entertainment that makes Alice in Wonderland look like a teen flick. Whether you're laughing, or crying, the film will keep you on your toes.The first few minutes are a little sluggish but you still find yourself intrigued by the bizarre camera work.  John Cusack plays Craig Schwartz a deprived puppeteer who is an brilliant, yet sadly unknown puppet master. Schwartz doesn't think he needs a day job until he offends a little girl's father with one of his puppet shows, and gets punched square in the face. After that he realizes that he needs a day job to support his wife, and hopefully a future child.Cusack's job interview leads to some of the funniest 20 minutes I have ever seen on screen.  With dark, and intellectual comedy at it's best, it's one of those scenes were you just die laughing in the aisles.Cusack's boss is old, senile, and thinks he has a speech impediment when actually he talks better than Cusack himself. He works on the 7 ½ floor where the ceiling raises 5 feet above the floor.  It's a place were everyone has to bend over to walk. While filing one day Cusack drops a folder behind a file cabinet.  While retrieving it he finds a small door that leads inside the brain of John Malkovich.These minutes of entertainment never dumb down, or slow up.  It just gets better and more surreal. You would expect them to run out of ideas; but they don't.  The laughs come on stronger, and the movie bullets in a different direction.Cusack ends up only being able to spend 15 minutes in Malkovich and afterwards gets dumped out by the side of the New Jersey Turnpike. He proceeds to tell his wife played by the beautiful Cameron Diaz, who in this movie looks appalling and utterly unattractive.  She wants to try it, and what she ends up finding is not a portal within John Malkovich, but rather a mirror into her innermost desires.  She finds her true self in another person's body.Instead of using this portal to try to find what the significance of it is Diaz and Cusack use it to fulfill their sexual fantasies with Cusack's co-worker, played by the lovely Catherine Keener.  However, it seems she is only attracted to them when they are within the body of Malkovich.The plot spirals into many different directions at this point, and steers clear of comedy. It becomes a philosophical message, which is: The only way we can be who we truly are; is in the mask of someone else.
Being John Malkovich' could be considered the Truman Show' of 1999, only more imaginative, and bizarre. The film is so deep that it's poetic. Everything in the movie has a meaning, and represents a symbol for life.
John Cusack gives an first-rate performance.  In the beginning you feel sorry for him.  In the middle you hate him. At the end you feel sorry once for him more. Cameron Diaz clearly has made the transition from comedy to drama, and establishes herself as a future award winner.
The last words heard in the film are the words ""Look Away"" muttered by Cusack in a depressive state.  However, you can't look away. You are so intrigued by the ending that you can't do anything but look intently at the film. This film deserves a standing ovation for what it has done for filmmakers.  It tells them to think of every possibility.  Hopefully we will see more original films like Malkovich' and less clichéd films like House on Haunted Hill' - Chris Sandberg4 out of 4 stars",Being John Malkovich

It was such an incredible directorial debut by Spike Jonze, and the acting was terrific. But best of all was the screenwriting. The movie had me in stitches the whole time. It was so humorous, and had so many excellent twists and turns.

529,joeziomek,An imaginative idea goes to waste,4,19 December 1999,"BEING JOHN MALKOVICH was based on a very imaginative idea; unfortunately Spike Jonze went in the wrong direction with it.  What Jonze should have done was make a low-budget sci-fi flick with this porthole idea.But instead, Jonze tried to inject a lesson into it.  Normally I would commend a director's efforts to be meaningful, but Jonze  failed with his attempt.First of all, the film was poorly cast.  When Diaz lost her beauty, she lost her believability too.  Cusack is a great actor but really screwed this one up.  Keener was OK but her character just stunk.  Malkovich, on the other hand, was perfect for the part.Second, the movie's try at being profound was shabby and feeble.  Making a point about being yourself vs. ""seeing the world through someone else's eyes"" could - maybe should - have been done in a more tangible...or at least more focused...setting.

530,frederikos.nikolis,a proof that original films are still being made,8,29 January 2000,"In an age of fast cut,videoclip-like,films, Being John Malkovich is a unique filmsensation. Clearly this is not a film everyone will like, but everybody will agree that it is very different. From the first scenes we are treated with an original approach to a familiar story. And along the film the story elaborates with an unique sense of humor but sometimes tries to tell more than is needed.Just like ""The Big Lebowski"" this film requires the audience to appreciate the strange sense of humor, and if you do, you are in for a treat. Of course the film has flaws. Made with an obvious shoestring budget some scenes are slovenly made (the microphone is visible in numerous scenes), and both female performances are confined by a script that focuses more on the males. John Cusack is brilliant as most of the times, and John Malkovich, a ""serious actor"", is obviously delighted with this spoof characterization of himself. The real problem with the film is that this ""one idea movie"" is a bit to long for it's own good. But all in all this is a film that everyone should go and see, as a proof that original films are still being made.",Being John Malkovich

If you have to bring in a chimp to make it funny, you're really on the wrong way. When was I gripped by the story or anyone of the characters? Never.

532,Clayton Hanson,Some things which I cannot believe,7,25 May 2000,"First, that this film is in the Top #250.Second, that this film is viewed as ground breaking in any significant way.Third, that the US film industry is so devoid of truly good films that this film would be so well-received by American audiences.****Regarding my first statement of disbelief, great works like ""Bronenosets Potyomkin"" and ""Rashomon"" are relegated to lower portions of the Top #250 and other greats, for vastly divergent reasons, like ""Horí, má panenko,"" ""Bittere Ernte,"" ""Mephisto"" and ""Le salaire de la peur"" aren't even among the Top #250.  How can this film, which breaks precious new ground be classed above the first two films, which have been monumentally important for the development of cinema throughout the whole world?  How can this film be called a great social critique when compared to ""Horí, má panenko"" and ""Mephisto""?  How can it compare to the study of deeply flawed characters found in films like ""Bittere Ernte"" and ""Le salaire de la peur""?  The answer to all three questions is that it recall can't.Regarding my second point, how is this film ground breaking, cutting edge, whatever?  Movies from music video directors aren't that rare.  Obsession with celebrity and the horrors wrought by greed are topics that have been covered extensively in the last fifty years.  Heck, even issues of sexual identity have been covered much better than this.  Perhaps the only thing that is truly cutting edge in this movie is the fact that it manages to incorporate so many ideas, and yet never really fully nurture any of them. Instead, it just rushes away on the next interesting point.Regarding my final point, what have these people been watching?  I regularly watch old and new imports from around the world and a whole heckuva lot of them are much better than this.  Do these people watch nothing but cynical American TV shows and movies where people don't care at all for each other or anyone (Just like this movie.  You doubt me?  Well, then why are Orson Bean and crew not debating the moral ramifications of ramming themselves into another man's head for the rest of his life?"")?Regardless of these criticisms, it remains a good movie (7/10), but is definitely not Top 250 material.",Being John Malkovich

Ultimately the movie asks us who we are and tries to urge us to enjoy who we are, regardless of our outer appearance. Whether it be gender or simple shame of one's appearance, the movie gives us examples of people who aren't happy with their physical bodes (ironically, the two people are married) and shows us that no matter who we try to be, ultimately we must be ourselves, and that this truth is inescapable.  In a way, the movie shows us that self-reliance is paramount.  The film shows an especially good contrast between a man who allows his passions to control his actions and another who uses reason to decide the fate of his life and in actuality the length of his life.  This theme is almost Platonic, because the movie shows us which course of action is more moral; and luckily, although perhaps not realistically, in this movie morality wins out.",Being John Malkovich

Metaphysical, but not heavy handed.  This film is also quite inspired by Spike's experience in music video direction.

It's the film that introduced me to Charlie Kaufman, and it inspired me to see other films he's written, namely Adaptation and Human Nature--another favorite. One of my favorite lines is when John Cusack looks over at his monkey pet and says something to the effect of 'you're lucky, monkey. You don't have to worry about.....consciousness.' The film has a hint of sadness, existentialism, but it brings on the funny. The performances by Cusack, Catherine Keener and Cameron Diaz are all great. And John Malkovich?

How this movie can be lauded as a classic is beyond me. Quite frankly, the fact that it is such a cult classic makes me wonder if the end of western civilization is near.Is it original? Yes. Is it creative? Yes. But is it GOOD?? A big NO. I must have looked at the clock every 2 minutes, just waiting for this.THING.in front of me to be over with. Just because a movie is new and original does not mean that it is good. I hate to generalize, but I certainly can see this garbage being a favorite of pseudo-intellectual, java sipping art house gurus, due to its bizarreness and originality. For most normal people, however, this movie will be nothing but a miserable experience. I've never seen a comedy that was less funny. The plot went from mildly interesting to surreal, the acting was stiff, the characters weren't compelling or endearing (how can one like a movie if the characters aren't likable, or, at the very least, interesting?), and, oh yeah, it was NOT funny at all. It will take a court order (and 10 stout men to enforce it) to ever get me to watch this horrid movie again. In fact, it'll take something extraordinary for me to ever see a Spike Jonze movie again.

So I'll give you a more useful review that's not tainted with too much emotion.This movie is an absurd comedy. And absurd comedy is like grapefruit - if you're expecting the taste of orange, you will be disappointed. But if you come with an open mind and no expectations then you'll have a chance to enjoy this odd flavor. Just like that office on the 7 1/2th floor that has absurdly low ceiling where staff go on about their daily work all hunched, not betting an eye about the absurdity of it all.The characters in the movie are odd and bizarre. They feel like they lack depth and they are hard to empathize or relate to. At first I blamed it on acting but then I realized this was deliberate. They are part of that bizarre, surreal world. And John Malcovic is the only normal person who finds himself in this bizarre world surrounded by twisted characters that act without morals and common sense. And this is when you're reminded of Truman Show.It's worth watching but it's not for everyone. It won't become my next favorite movie but I've enjoyed being taken on a different, non-conventional, twisted journey where I found myself laughing many times.",Being John Malkovich
547,ffooky,Brilliant!,10,18 October 2008,"I adore this film and have watched over and over. It features two of my favourite actors - Johns' Cusack and Malkovich. The former gives a particularly deep and touching performance as the struggling puppeteer Craig Shwartz. He's a beautiful man and he captures the audiences imagination and sympathy. He's sensitive and dissatisfied with his life with his rather insensitive (at least to his needs) wife Lotte; played by Cameron Diaz, who is not an actress I've never rated very highly, though she is perfectly competent in this role. It is a film which offers the audience so many possibilities on a number of levels, from Craig's becoming captivated by Maxine a fellow employee at a most peculiar office Craig gets a job in early into the film. Much to his dismay any adulterous ambitions he initially has are rendered hopeless by the fact that Maxine has no interest in him as a suitor - is she MAD? Anyhow, Craig discovers by chance, a concealed hole in the wall of an office in work, which if you progress down this hole you end up inhabiting the the being of John Malkovich. After he convinces an unsurprisingly sceptical Maxine of this, she sees the commercial possibilities charging potential customers for fifteen minutes of John Malkovich. Although she herself never tests out the Malkovich experience, she soon, along with the still desperate for her Craig, to make it a success. Craig's desire for Maxine and his realisation that she does not share his feelings is made all the more acute when, after meeting Lotte for the first times declares to be ""smitten"" with her. Poor, desperate Craig, what can he do? The object of his desire is taken with his wife and to make a more complication proposition, wants her when she is John, She tells Lotte, who makes an attempt to embrace. ""Only as John."" Craig is now very probably set never to gain Maxine and also to lose his wife.He is desperate and as a result conspires to deceive Maxine by inhabiting John when she believes Lotte is the one pulling his strings. As an exceptionally gifted puppeteer, Craig manages to utilise his ability to manipulate and does succeed in being Malkovich, and eventually tells Maxine, who is by now pregnant with John/Lotte's baby, that it has been him all along. And so Craig is John and manages to turn John into a puppeteer. A puppeteer being a puppeteer being a puppeteer! Spectacular. Surely though, something so mind bendingly freaky can't go smoothly. Course not, and eventually Maxine releases it is Lotte simply being Lotte who she wants to be with. In the background of all these events involving the four principal characters, is Dr. Lester, Craigs employer, a 105 year old man, who, along with a select group of friends has no plans to die. THEY want to be John Malkovich too and have no intention of allowing Craig to thwart their plans. They make him agree to surrender his occupation of John by telling him they are holding his wife as security. This is untrue, she is with Dr. Lester and co having managed to escape from the pet chimpanzee's cage Craig had imprisoned her in, but she is there willingly and is even invited to join them in being Malkovich. It all goes at a terrific pace with a number of extraneous plot lines, such as earlier John becoming himself, or rather living his subconscious self during which he is in a smart restaurant in which everyone present is JM, the only words uttered are Malkovich and the only written words are Malkovich, which takes the form of a menu which lists every item as Malkovich. An amusing inclusion in this scene includes two female malkovichs, one of whom sings ""Malkovich"", repeatedly whilst seated on top of a piano. The full horror of this has JM screaming his own name. Unsurprisingly is is thoroughly disturbed by this and once his time as himself is up he ends by threatening Craig with legal action if the portal to his being is not blocked up forever. It's funny but you clearly feel his terror and incomprehension at the situation. He knows when he is not acting independently but has hitherto not understood what was happening. The film concludes happily for everyone other than Craig. He leaves Malkovich, the aged Dr. Lester et al inhabit him and he appears not to be troubled by the situation as is shown in one of the last scenes where he greets an old Charlie Sheen, making his second appearance in the film where he plays a charming cameo role as himself. Lotte and Maxine, even after having taken several potshots and they have John's child to keep them company. She, seemingly, is a future vessel for further life greedy occupants. Brilliant. The very sad aspect in all of this is Craig being abandoned and alone. An essentially good man, he lost control of his feelings and ending up losing control of everything in a desperate attempt to be in control. I think John Cusack's portrayal of Craig is one of his finest roles to date. He really inhabits his character, please excuse the pun, and completely shines.In conclusion, a quirky and fascinating film which has so much to say about human nature. Another nice touch was John's reference, whilst talking to Charlie Sheen at the end, to Gary Sinise, an old member of their Steppenwolf theatre company in Chicago. Do watch this film; it can't be spoiled by knowing how it develops, there is so much to it.",Being John Malkovich

None of the characters are likable, and the amoral nature of the whole plot ditches character development and abandons reason.

550,sanddramatist,One of my favourite films ever,10,3 April 2014,"I knew nothing about Spike Jonze, had not read the critical reviews, and was not a fan of John Malkovich prior to viewing this film. I watch both mainstream and independent film and am critical of both. I went to see it with a psychotherapist friend and we were both thoroughly enjoyed it! If you are at all familiar with and appreciative of Jungian psychology, psychosynthesis, drama therapy, and surrealism, there is a strong probability that you will get this film. It also helps if you have a sense of fun and humour, a willingness to suspend belief, a love of creativity, imagination, and originality, an understanding of the functioning of the human psyche, and an attention span. The introspective encounter with one's own internalized roles or subpersonalities was brilliantly and humorously portrayed in the film. The love it or hate it reactions are not so surprising.

But almost!I'm going to pretty much bash everything I remember about this sad, sad movie So if you haven't seen it DON'T...(keep reading that is)Anyways, I thought the movie was pathetic.  Yes, the acting was good. Great, in fact.  Yes, I was impressed with the visual aspects.  Yes, the directing was just peachy.  But the movie was hardly funny.  The only time I laughed out loud during the entire movie was the first time our hero was excreted onto the side of the NJ Turnpike.  It was so random and unexpected that I had to laugh.  And that, was it.  I thought the writing was very bad. The character motivations were so...awkward.  Like our hero, the puppeteer. What was he in for?  The girl, artistic integrity, what?  And everything just turned to doo for him in the end?  What a bummer.  But the real enigma of this flop of a movie was what's-her-name.  Oh yes, and don't worry, I suck with names in real life too :-).  So the black haired woman, what's she in for?  Everything she does contradicts everything else.  I don't understand how she could possible fall in love with puppet-man's wife. It is so completely unrealistic, it goes beyond funny.  It just sets me in the theatre with a confused look.  Her motivation is unrealistic and lame. It seems like the writer got stoned one night and said, ""hey, what if she, like, falls in love with the other chick and they raise their daughter...and stuff...""  Like the nileists (really bad spelling nie-uhl-ists) in the Big Lebowsky.  i.e., the writer got stoned one night and said ""let's have some nileists...and a ferret!""  Go figure. But what steams me the most is the complete lack of structure in the movie. It starts out like its going to be a long drawn out internal struggle to maintain artistic integrity in puppeteering and then bam, John Malkovich, and everything starts speeding up.

Praise to everyone involved with this weird yet plausible and not too bizarre to get caught up in filmed story, after which you will never look at puppetry the same way again.  It's basically about people who, for some reason or other, just can't be themselves, either because others won't accept them for that, or they can't accept themselves, or else, well, it's their JOB to be someone else.  An out of work puppeteer lands what he thinks at first is a normal clerical job, discovers by accident a channel into the mind of a notable actor, and is coerced by a scheming co-worker to sell tickets for the experience ..... and pays a dear price himself in the process.

I like John Cusack, I like John Malkovich, I even like Jackass (another product of the director), but I hate this movie.To see a movie with the promise of such creative introspection be blown to crap by such worthless writing and story development pangs my soul. Just the title of this movie has so much potential. The writers and director could have done so much with the idea of seeing the world through someone else's eyes, or knowing someone else's responsibilities for a day, but noooo. This movie glorifies everything that makes ours the sick culture that it can be. In the end the most selfish characters in the film are rewarded with bliss and happiness, the one person with any artistic vision is doomed to a life of torture and agony, and one of my favorite actors looses his marbles to the voice of The Hobbit (look it up).If you ever wanted to add more hours to your day, simply skip seeing any part of this poor excuse of capitalizing on a pre-established name.

571,Endaevour,Something surprisingly different!,9,22 April 2002,I have watched Being John Malkovich and it was a very confusing experience. For the first time I saw a movie and couldn't figure out at any point what would happen next. Many times I tried to think - like a writer - how would I solve this next problem but the writers of BJM had came up with very surprising ideas.Movie concluded several puppet show scenes which described dreams of the characters in the film and I guess also our deepest ones too. There was something very scary when the puppetmaster made his puppet to watch submissively upwards to it's master... Is this how we live too? Are we also just puppets? Okay... I have to say that if you are not so interested in philosophical thinking you can still watch the movie because it really is funny!I was also very surprised that I found Cameron Diaz from the cast because I really didn't notice her appearance and her character actually was one of the main characters. I guess it was quite hard to recognize her in thick sweater and dark wig - she looks very much nothing like she is used to be seen. And she really is a good actor. John Cusack was also great and I just had to admire John Malkovich - he played so well himself.,Being John Malkovich
572,intense_life,Brillant conceptual film,8,20 August 2019,"A conceptual and clever movie which I thoroughly enjoyed. The plot is about this mundane couple - the wife lotte has pet chimps and lizards and Craig ""works"" as a failed puppeteer because he can be other characters. Then he found a job in a filing company, gets attracted to Maxine and discovered a secret door that he can go down and immediately see the world through an acclaimed actor John Malkovich for 15 minutes before being spit out onto the side of the road, and they start to profit of this discovery with tons of people paying to experience being JM. 1. The idea that it is so much more comfortable and confident being someone else, maybe because it is for a mere 15minute as a passive viewer, the excitement of living another persons life, the experience without the responsibility, a small piece of escapism. Somehow, I can relate to that in the identity of an aspie, the more you play it, the more it becomes a part of your existence and comfort. I find this an interesting concept that if we can adopt different personas to our advantages. Of course in the film, only craig and lotte manipulated JM, and im assuming the rest of the queue were just passive observers in his body.2. There was a scene where John Malkovich himself went into the tunnel and became John Malkovich and everywhere he looked were different versions of JM doing different things and he was frightened and ran. To me, this is perhaps the fear of facing up to our own different personas and not knowing what to do, and running from ourselves. Its a poignant scene to reveal the discomfort in being ourselves vs the thrill of being another character.3. Maxine was always and ultimately only attracted to JM's body when lotte is in it. The idea that it will always be the core and soul of the person one is attracted to. Craig invaded his body, fucked and married Maxine and had a successful puppeteer career using the fame of JM...he was afraid to leave JMs body because then who is he? In the end, he did. Maxine revealed to lotte that she was pregnant by her - sex while she was in JMs body and they raised a JM daughter together.4. The group of old people continue to use the vessel of the malkovich line (in the daughter) to continue living and not die.....I take this to mean that everyone of us is a sum of other people in us.5. I like that the title uses the actors real name John Malkovich as he is playing himself and it is a successful film vs his character Craig who is always trying to be someone else through his puppeting efforts or living JM's life and it was not a good ending.",Being John Malkovich

575,nored,First 1/3 of movie: **** Second 2/3: ** (possible spoilers),5,13 March 2004,"""Being John Malkovich"" is a very well done movie.  So why didn't I like it? Let me start by saying that I do like the first third of the movie.  The establishment of the hidden surreal environment tucked away right in the middle of Manhattan was particularly well done and appealing. 
Why didn't I like it?  I'm going to have to get extremely subjective here, so bear with me.  I think the main reason that the movie as a whole didn't work for me is a lack of identification with the characters.  If you've never had a desire to be someone else then you probably won't identify with the motivations of the Cameron Diaz character.  Quite often you can become interested in a character even without such identification.  That didn't happen either.  As a painfully ""normal"" and content male I found it incredibly hard to be interested in the hysterical desires of an unattractive woman who is doubting her choice of partner, her sexuality and even her gender.  Such musings don't offend me, they simply don't interest me.  As for the other characters, they are almost uniformly unattractive.  They are purposely unattractive.  If I can't sympathize with the characters and have no superficial interest in any of them then that makes for an unsatisfactory viewing experience.  I can tell you objectively that this is a good movie.  Subjectively, if you're a heterosexual guy who is comfortable in his own skin with no gender issues or doubts about your sexuality then you stand a good chance of being disappointed by this movie.

In a span of only its first 15 minutes, this film covered and delved into much deeper themes that most movies can't even fully develop in a three hour time slot.Cameron Diaz shows us a side of her acting that she has not ever shown before.  Instead of playing the cute and stylish dream girl (as she played in ""My Best Friend's Wedding"" and ""There's Something About Mary""), she trades in her chic blond hair for a massive, mousy brown nest of frizz. The superficial attitude and flights of giggles are gone; her character has depth, and Diaz does an excellent job of playing opposite John Cusack.Bravos to Malkovick (playing ""himself""), Cusack, Diaz, and Catherine Keener. This movie is a kick-butt premier for Spike Jonze-- I can't wait to see his next feature length film.This is a must see for anyone who has ever wanted to be someone else, anyone who craves more to life than what's on the surface, and/or anyone who has ever wondered just who really is in control of his/her life.Be sure to see this with someone intelligent so you can wage some decent discussion and debate afterwards.There are strings attached:  you won't walk out of this movie as the same exact person as you were when you walked in.  If you understand any of the many themes, you will feel enlightened.What more could you want in a film?  There's satire about American society, philosophical thought throughout, a mirror of the quientisential Everyman, and it's all tied together with an edge of eerieness, straight-up humor, and cameos by Sean Penn and Brad Pitt... all while poking fun at itself!This smorgashboard of good stuff makes ""Being John Malkovick"" a hit!

Even with the predictable plot line, the writing left holes and the directing made the movie choppy.  This in turn limited the superior acting ability of the cast making their characters have no appeal.If you're looking for a big budget film with an independent feel, get Dogma.

The film was logically inconsistent.  The problem is not simply its poor logic, but that that failed to tell a good or interesting story. If this film exemplifies innovation, then Hollywood is in serious trouble. The film demonstrates that Hollywood is bereft of good story tellers. A more interesting story might have been exploring the question of would we return to a single mind if, in travelling into a new body we could bring along friends.?  If many people can be in one body at a time and a host body can go into another host body, via the doorway, then an infinite or even several repetitions of this process will lead to a lot of people in one head.  If the film had explored the cosmological possibilities that the original mind was God or simply a teenager in Burbank, California, then the story might have been of interest. Think of a reversed _Truman Show_. If the film had explored schizophrenia, then it might have been interesting.  However, we would probably have been watching a poor take off on the television series _Herman's Head_. (It scares me that people think that _Being_ is an innovative film.)   If the doorway into another person's head had been explored, in the way that Kubrick tried to study male-female relationships through the film _Eyes Wide Shut_, or evolution in _2001_then the film might have been interesting.  Alas, Spike Jonz is no Kubrick.  Perhaps it is too much to ask, but why not?Another problem was character development. The character Maxine (Max), played by Catherine Keener (major babe), was under developed. A golden opportunity wasted.  Instead we are treated to the archetypical lives of John Cusack (Craig) and Cameron Diaz (Lotte). We see little of Max's life. Max was the most interesting character because she represented an edgier and grittier character than the gormless nearly amorphous characters played by Cusack and Diaz.  Their performances were mediocre in filling such formless characters. Cusack was better in _Say Anything_, as Lloyd Dobbler.  Diaz, while playing against type, was undeveloped.  She can act, but not in that role.  I think she was poorly cast because she was cast against type. Julie Hagerty would have made an interesting Lotte.The first puppet play, acts as an overture for the film and offers an intriguing start, but it goes downhill from there.  If the story had explored the question of identity with any integrity or focus, it could have been great.  The story could have explored what it is that makes us who we are.  Who is John Malkovich?Is there an original or are is he, are we, simply a collection of separate identities that emerge periodically? _Fight Club_, a shallow and pretentious film, explored this question with some effect. Unfortunately, _FC_ was a philosophically flawed film that never should have been made, but that is a subject for a different review.If _Being_ had been as gritty or as pseudo-honest as _FC_, we might have had a classic.  Instead, we are treated to a few laughs and conned into believing that we have been included in a sophisticated tour de force.The idea deserved a better script.  The film's sexual sub-plot was distracting.  The film tried to justify this by exploring the issue of sexual attraction.  The problem is not in its content, but that it is so trite and really there for shock effect rather than to be meaningfully explored.  Are screenwriters bereft of originality and ideas that they have to troll through Howard Stern programs?Was the plot really that innovative and daring? The film was about as innovative and daring as the script and dialogue for _Star Wars_. (To its credit SW never claimed or was spoken of as innovative in this way). The story was simplistic, trite, and overplayed its few scenes of humor. The receptionist story line, like the 71/2 floor was funny the first time.  After that, it dragged.  I wonder if the screenwriter was inspired by Monty Python stories but lacked the daring to bring off a similar farce.As for its main premise, that we, or anyone, would want to be John Malkovich, who cares?  I have enough trouble and fun trying to find out who I am and why. Are other people's lives so boring or so well understood that they have the time or the desire to be someone else?  If anything demonstrates the death of imagination, I suppose it would be this. The film's premise had potential which was its only saving grace. The film could have been great if it had  explored voyeurism.  I am not suggesting a crude expose like _Body Double_, or a more sophisticated understanding in _Sex, Lies, and Videotape_  or even the classic _Rear Window_ but one that could explore the soul of the entertainment industry.The film could explore an industry where appearance masks a hidden reality. An industry that has changed and distorted popular culture through its insistence on emphasizing the surface, or the look, over its content or its meaning. One can understand why modern art like film rarely possess a complex thought.  The result is that films and modern art simply pursue shock or the lowest common denominator: sex. If the film had explored the voyeuristic soul of popular culture instead of relying on the cheap and jejune titillation offered by the lesbian subplot, it might have been better. Think of _The Player_ crossed with _Being_.In the end, the film sputters and stumbles along ending with at best a whimper.  A perfect fin-de-siecle film with its near manic attempt to appear, fresh, innovative, and oh-so-fashionable but failing to mask the hidden desperation born of the realization that it possesses none of those qualities. Like the day after the Oscars, the film is a poor after image, a residue of the potentialities that it could have been.",Being John Malkovich
592,Lolo-23,Just too boring!,7,16 May 2000,"What should I say about this movie. At first, the appearances of the actors were brilliant, especially Cameron Diaz did very well as Lotti. The idea of the movie was also absolutely unique and strange, but I think the movie was not worth all that. It had it's really funny and witty moments (Charlie Sheen), but all in all it was just too boring. Perhaps I didn't get the meaning of this movie, if anyone did, please mail me.",Being John Malkovich
593,peechee,Brilliantly Funny,10,14 November 1999,"I admit that I wanted to see this film for the sheer absurdity of the premise, but I was oh so pleasantly surprised to find that it was an amazingly funny. I wasn't expecting this.John Cusack was fabulous! His character was at the beginning a lovable oaf who dreams of making a living as a puppeteer, but settles for a job as a filing clerk for a company situated on the 71/2 floor of an office building. Which has amazingly low ceilings. It's when he discovers the portal to John Malkovich that his dreams start to become a little maniacal.I've never been impressed much with Cameron Diaz, but I have a whole new respect for her as an actress after seeing this film. She is almost unrecognizable as John Cusack's wife Lottie with no makeup and frizzy brown hair.And as always, John Malkovich was superb! I highly recommend this film to everyone. Don't let the premise turn you off. It's brilliantly acted, and intelligently funny. And the cameo of Charlie Sheen was sheer genius!",Being John Malkovich
594,BBQueen,A gimmick movie that goes beyond the gimmick,9,7 November 1999,"The concept of people entering another person's brain and seeing the world through that person's eyes would certainly be original, but add the fact that the person is a famous actor, and the plot may sound gimmicky. However, it would be an injustice to delegate this movie to gimmick status because the sharp plot, the witty dialogue, the surreal visuals, and the good cast make it the best movie I've had the pleasure of seeing so far this year.Although, the movie did not start off right away with the concept of entering John Malkovich's mind, it was just great seeing John Cusack take on another unforgettable role as Craig the puppeteer. I was totally absorbed by his puppeteering, not to mention the fact that seeing him and Cameron Diaz look so bizarre was worth the price of admission alone. Further, besides Craig's failure at making a living with a puppeteer, his marriage is pretty much deficient too. Both of these spheres from his life come to a crash when he finds a new job where he meets the woman he is really in love with, and where he's lucky enough to stumble onto a passageway into the actor, John Malkovich's brain. This is where the movie gets very surreal, but luckily it never seems too silly for its own good. I don't want to spoil anymore about what happens next because it includes one of the funniest moments captured on film.Let me just say that my worries about Spike Jonze being like most video directors turned movie directors, all style and no substance, is now put to rest, and I am eagerly looking forward to his next full length feature. I was also happy to see that the concept wasn't too gimmicky or weird for it's own good.I now feel the movie is the best of this year. Although, another film may yet take that honor this year, there's no way that a more original movie could come out this year. I hope that Charlie Kaufman is recognized for his outrageous concept, and if he isn't at least nominated for many screen-writing awards this year, I'll be very upset.",Being John Malkovich

Outrageous idea, very well executed in a way which almost teases you forever about when do we become John Malkovich, as if we were also clientele on the 7 1/2 floor.Malkovich isn't always a weird character.  His Biff in 1986's Death of a Salesman with Dustin Hoffman was straight-laced.

Good plot, good acting (especially by my main man John Cusak) and also a breakout hottie.....Catherine Keener.  Rowwwwwwr, where did she come from?  I saw her in Living in Oblivion like 4 years ago, but she wasn't as fine as she is now.  G-damn.  Okay, off subject.  Anyway, I highly suggest seeing this movie, you won't be disappointed.

Through most of the movie, I kept thinking, ""wow, this would be great if we were stoned or tripping"", but since I don't do that anymore, I had to settle on my own boggled mind. I saw this movie without knowing who the actors or director were, or anything about it, for that matter. I was pleasantly surprised when I figured out that it was John Cusak and Cameron Diaz! Wow! They CAN get out of their cookie-cutter roles, and they DID! Diaz, as the pathetic Lotte Schwartz was both sad and amusing. Cusak, as her husband Craig, was disturbing at times, but also so sincere about how he feels about life. Catherine Keener, who plays love interest Maxine, is somewhat charming and always downright rude! She was great! Now, Malkovich himself... hmm... I have to wonder if there were any other actors on the title before him. His appearance throughout the movie was just so BLAH, except for ONE certain scene in which he ""branches out"" (if you know what I mean, you've seen the movie).

Also, there are many dry portions in the action where I felt a better job of tying in the major themes would have been more appropriate.

610,OrigamiGypsy,Unimaginative,3,21 March 2001,"I bought (yes BOUGHT, not RENTED, but BOUGHT) this movie without having seen it.  That, my friends, is faith.  I had read about the premise and thought it was brilliant; truly innovative.  ""Finally"", I thought, ""a movie that might wash the bitter taste of Lost in Space: The Motion Picture out of my mouth!""  I believed that it might even move me to forget the mistake I made in seeing Hollow Man, though in my defense I was dragged to the theater by two very well-meaning friends.  I must say I was also influenced by the wonderful cast. I mean, there was not one actor in that movie whom I despised, a rarity in my case.  So what, you may be thinking, was my problem?Let me tell you.As far as a wonderful idea goes Being John Malkovich didn't let me down. The film holds an idea born of sheer brilliance, and, let's face it, probably more than a little cannabis.  It is an idea rife with promise and potential.  With it this work could've gone so many wonderful places and could've expanded minds like no movie since Spaceballs has even attempted. The makers of this film could have done all of these things and more with such a fresh idea, such an imaginative idea, but did they?  No.  That is why I am so bitter.  I wasted $16.50.  The makers of this film instead took an idea that was so original, so untouched, so imaginative and turned it into the most trite sex farce I have ever seen.  They turned it into a movie all about sex.  I felt insulted.  Sex is the least thought-provoking theme that a movie could ever have, and it is almost blasphemous when applied to a film with such artistic potential.  I mean, who doesn't think about sex at least once every minute?  Yeah, real unique.  To be honest, the latter part of the movie seemed like a cop out.  It seemed to me that the script writer wasn't sure of what to do with such a gem of an idea.  Here in his usually capable hands was something that no one had done before, so he panicked and ruined it with an almost narcoleptic ignorance of what he was doing.  Like Dorothy, he had no idea what a pair of ruby slippers could do, so he let them go to waste.  At least Dorothy realized the power of those damn shoes by the end of her romp through Oz and decided to do something about it.  Being John Malkovich makes no such about-face, however.  In fact it falls flat on its face.  Still, like every movie it has its moments and I definitely think it's worth viewing, just don't make the same mistake I did.  For the love of all that's good and decent, borrow it from somewhere.3/10 For giving it the old college try",Being John Malkovich

Age, I thought would have brought more tolerance. It did. I sat through the whole movie gnashing my teeth and wanting to rub all my paws together so I don't launch into the screen. It's wrong at so many different levels that I'm not sure where to begin. First the art house message we're supposed to get -- how at different times of our lives we're inhabited by or inhabit myriad different personas that the true ""you"" might only rarely, or never, emerge. Yeah. It's true. Star Wars watchers have brains too. We get it. And still don't like it. Because BJM insists on taking what many have hailed as the ""creative"" route to the message, but is in fact only a demented below the waist inability to draw lines. ***spoiler alert***1. It has both Craig and Lotte Shwartz (Cusack and Diaz) in love with touch-me-not Catherine Keener (Maxine Lund). Which would be fine if it were not for the fact that both Schwartzes then repeatedly enter Malkovich's body solely to mate with now touch-me-please Keener. Imagine Malkovich was Halle Berry. And try and find it funny. If people inside her were making her commit sexual acts that she wasn't in control of, you would essentially consider it rape. If there are ways to make that look funny, BJM didn't crack it. 2. At a more fundamental level, if the movie wanted to be different with Cusack's puppeteer being different from the one usually portrayed - - it failed. And he isn't. Schwartz ends up being the same demented sad story of Criminal Minds and CSI who's taken his own metaphors (of man who pulls the strings and living in another man's skins) too seriously. The man who's locked his wife in a cage. 3. Finally, there isn't even a character to connect with though Mrs Schwartz could have been.

From the conception of the title, to the outline of the story, down to the preview of the film - this movie, no doubt, was going to be either the stupidest creation from some pretty screwed up minds....or it was going to be pure genius, from some of today's most creative film makers.Genius, it very well was.  I mean, whose eyes would it be better to see through than John Malcovich's?  Not many.  John Malcovich deserves Academy recognition for this film, even though he's just acting like himself for most of the movie.  And John Cusack gives his best performance yet as the man who discovers the portal to the unknown (i.e. John Malcovich's head).To compare this movie to anything else would be impossible - it stands on it's own, and may single-handedly redefine the 'weird' movie genre (as ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" and ""Die Hard"" did for the action genre, and ""Scream"" did for the horror genre). ""Being John Malcovich"" is one of the top 25 best films of the 90's.  To me, it was more than just a simple viewing experience - it opened up a new light to entertainment, thinking and film making.  Whether you like this film or not is beside the question - you will acknowledge how much different it was than anything you have ever seen, or ever will see again.",Being John Malkovich
627,dmuth-2,I'm crazy about this movie.,10,7 November 1999,"This is an insanely GREAT movie! Nothing has been attempted like this before, and it keeps coming up with surprises and ingenuity until the very end. I laughed with delight all the way through, even though the movie is intentionally, unrelentingly, disorienting and creepy.John Malkovich is fabulous playing ""himself"". John Cusack and Cameron Diaz deliver some of their best. The directing is amazing--especially considering that it's Spike Jonze's first big one.When my friends and I left the theater, we were stunned, happy, and exhilarated, and everything seemed a little surreal.",Being John Malkovich
628,Klopman,Odd script made great by the wonderful actors,10,22 November 1999,This movie is a refreshing change to what comedies have become. So many comedies use the slapstick or toilet humor to get laughs. Being John Malkovich uses a tremendous cast to get laughs from a fairly disturbing story line. It uses one of the best actors of the late 20th century and puts him on display for anyone who wants to be him. The script is truly original and left the theater with a refreshing glimpse into true comedic genius.,Being John Malkovich
629,Johnalan,Amazing,10,24 February 2000,"I cannot stop talking about this movie.  It is truly amazing.  This is one of the most creative and original concepts that I have ever seen on screen.

If you're the kind of person who can't sit through something that you consider to be ""strange"" or ""weird"" then don't go see it.

631,jfreund,"Quirky, weird, wonderful",10,3 October 1999,"The premise of being able to portal oneself into Malkovich's brain is quirky enough, but that's only the launch point for this story, which has more to do with relationships and sexuality as with anything else.  One of the neat things is that the film continues to get stranger in its very premise as it progresses--never does it rest on its laurels and simply let the characters run through their paces.True, fine (and funny) speculative fiction very much in the Philip K.

It's getting away from the typical suspense Hollywood flick.  This was one of the most creative productions, probably since this was produced by Michael Stipe and directed by Spike Jonze.  The performances by Cameron Diaz, John Cusak, and Elizabeth Keener were amazing.John Malkovich also gives a stellar performance of being himself, and letting others be him.  The end has a very nice touch; it reminds you of one of Nirvana's music videos.  If you don't like the actors, you'll love the premise behind the story!",Being John Malkovich
634,Quilty-7,Spike Jonze has moved from MTV to the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion...,7,1 November 1999,"Having seen Being John Malkovich at a Yale Film Society screening while visiting a friend, I can say that I am looking at one of this year's Best Picture Nominees. If it, with American Beauty and Fight Club make the Best Picture List, the 2000 Oscars may be known as the ""year of the surrealist attacks upon commercial society."" Being John Malkovich is not as visually surreal as one would initially assume it to be, but its plot is warped and twisted enough to require near linear cinematography. In it, a disgruntled and unemployed puppeteer who takes a white-collar job to please his wife discovers a portal into the mind of the actor, John Malkovich. The meditations upon the meaning of fame, viewpoint, relationships in and outside the sphere of normality, and the New Jersey Turnpike are handled with a veneer of black humor which lies finely over the mind-blowing and exciting ideas that these concepts raise. All of the ambiguities are classically handled by the sublime performances of the leads in Being John Malkovich, especially John Cusack, whose tall frame provides one of the most engaging sight gags in the whole film, as his office is on the 7 1/2 floor where he has to stoop: ""low overhead."" Cameron Diaz, Charlie Sheen, and Catherine Keener (also coming off a good performance in 8MM, one of the few saving graces of that film) are all also excellent, and John Malkovich may get a Best Supporting nod just for his rendition of what going through one's own portal is like. The short summary remains: see Being John Malkovich. Go with a friend. Talk about the movie. Talk about life. Wander for a bit. When it really hits you, sit down. Then see it again.",Being John Malkovich
635,Riggers,Brilliant directorial debut by Spike Jonze - the one to watch !,10,21 April 2000,"After having this recommended to me by a friend, I had high hopes for it, and was not disappointed. A hard film to pigeonhole, as it has elements of most genres, this film is (loosely) about a frustrated puppeteer, Craig, who after much badgering from his wife, get's a 'proper' job as an office clerk in the 7 1/2 floor of an office, where he discovers a portal to, yes you've guessed it, John Malkovich's brain, where he can see what John sees. Things start to get out of hand when he starts selling tickets, and soon Craig's wife, a fellow employee and John himself get involved it this crazy and inspired film. Go See It!",Being John Malkovich

Started having those Andy Warhol flashbacks, although seeing John Cusack getting punched was actually the highlight, wish that guy would have punched more of the actors in the movie, the Director needs to go back to Music Videos, sure they aren't very good either, but at least you can listen to the music, rather than some idiot rambling on about life, or whatever he was talking about.  -10 stars out of 10.",Being John Malkovich
637,ChuckJerry,"Great concept, slow moving at first, but really gets going.",10,29 October 1999,"I really liked this movie.  All of the comedy is really irreverent, but it fits so well into the story.  Spike Jonze finally stops directing music videos and has come up with a gem.  Cusack is great as a puppeteer who finds a portal into John Malkovich's head.  The reason this movie struck me as so funny I think is because Malkovich does not take himself seriously, but at the same time plays the role with real sincerity.  A novel idea and a great effort.  Unlike the Truman Show which was also a great idea, but which didn't come off very well.  This movie is as weird as it seems.",Being John Malkovich
638,TomVeil-2,Fantastic science-fiction/romance/comedy,9,16 November 1999,"The local reviews I read of ""Being John Malkovich"" were not too enthusiastic, so when I saw this movie today my expectations were amazingly exceeded. This movie was thoroughly enjoyable from start to finish... no lags, no lame dialog, very few cliches. As a science fiction, it's very surreal, much like Terry Gilliam's ""Brazil""... the comedy is equally well done, a bit bizarre like the old ""Saturday Night Live"" and ""Monty Python's Flying Circus""... and the romantic aspect is twisted beyond anything you've ever imagined.Although the movie contains elements of other work as mentioned above, overall it's extremely unique, very refreshing, and cleverly done. I think it would be most enjoyed by those of us who have a slightly twisted sense of humor and some familiarity with John Malkovich.",Being John Malkovich
639,pappy3k,Alice in Wonderland for the Freudian age,10,28 October 1999,"I just saw a screening.  This film is so perfectly bizarre, funny, and human, that I'm sure you'll enjoy it.

640,doremon,Over-rated!,4,5 November 1999,"I have to say that I am pretty disappointed with the film...  maybe the film is too hyped up or something...  or critics just WANNA LOVE this film, trying to make themselves believe that the film is deeper than it is intended to be...  the premise of the film is definitely pretty original... and there are some interesting scenes... but what it has got to say is really nothing revolutionary... or even worth spending time figuring out...I walked out feeling as empty as the time I felt after watching the mega-lame ""There's something about Mary""...  At least Mary didn't TRY to be deep... maybe I should have left my brain at the door... and I think I would have enjoyed Malkovich so much better as a farce for the mindless..",Being John Malkovich

I don't think I've had this much fun in a long time and that's not a bad thing.  This is probably the only entertaining movie I've seen this year that happened to also set it for me and stand out.Yeah yeah yeah, American Beauty was funny and gorgeously filmed but too easy all at the same time that it felt like ""accessible intelligence for the masses"" or something.  Whereas this movie doesn't require you try to pretend you're seeing some honest portrayal of Americans.  You just know it is but would rather say it was the most hilarious film.",Being John Malkovich

John Cusack looks like the Big Lebowski himself, Catherine Keener is excellent, Diaz gives a great performance while trying to look less beautiful than usual. She should have gotten an Oscar-nomination for this, but I'm pretty sure she'll get one within the next two years anyway, if she keeps picking her roles like she's doing right now. And of course there's Malkovich himself, who is hilarious, as are the many cameos.

643,stravitz,I have seen the light and it is John Malkovich,10,31 October 1999,"The most creative movie I have ever seen. I won't bother summarizing because it wouldn't even begin to do the film justice. All I can say is that I was so mesmerized by the concept and the performances that the film could have been 45 hours of John Malkovich brushing his teeth and I still would have been weeping uncontrollably. If you want to indulge your fascinations and get lost in a wild creative ride SEE THIS MOVIE. I only wish I had thought of the idea first, but I probably would have come up with something much less interesting like ""Being Bob Saget"". No offense I think I saw every episode of ""Full House"". Anyway this movie is certainly a must see and will captivate your imagination well after you've left the theatre. If nothing at all it's a blast to sit through.",Being John Malkovich

So I got to see this because we get to see quite a few movies to screen at UW (University of Washington)  Saw it last week or so, and it was probably the craziest movie of the year.  It was dark, twisted, insane, hilarious at times.  There are a few boring parts, for the most part the movie rocked. It was 100 precent unique.  No other movie has come close to being anything like this.  I loved it in the end and recommend it.  Grades: A-/4 stars/9.5 rating",Being John Malkovich
645,raidasan,bizarre...,10,1 November 1999,I went into this movie expecting it to be strange and off-the-wall.  I was not disappointed.  Charlie Kaufman's writing was brilliant as was Spike Jonze's direction.  This movie makes you believe in the next generation of directors and leaves many of today's great directors in the dust.,Being John Malkovich
646,DAF-5,"Bizarre, beautiful, fun.",10,29 October 1999,"For those who want their reviews as ""thumbs up/thumbs down"", see it. This movie is stranger than you think, funnier than you might imagine, and actually somewhat troubling. It's a bizarre fairy tale, a twisted fantasy, and a warped love story. It's directed by a former skateboard cameraman, who went mainstream, first with music videos (Beastie Boy's ""Sabotage"") and commercials (the one I recall involves doctors, the song ""Tainted Love"", and an EKG).I should warn you that I walked into this movie tremendously excited and enthusiastic. It's set in New York City and prominently features a bit of the New Jersey Turnpike that I know well. Better, I got free passes. Yet USA Films has in no obvious other way bought me out, and any ebulence I show is strictly coincidental. Heck, they didn't even give me a movie poster or a John Malkovitch mask. So I'm sort of resentful.The movie has two trailers. In one, we hear the soundtrack to ""Fast, Cheap, and Out of Control"" while Steven Hawking's voice explains that humans are vessels for something else. In the other, John Cusack asks for the seven and a halfth floor, and the lady with him jams down the ""STOP"" button and crowbars open the elevator. Clearly, she's done this before, and the elevator shows the damage. That trailer is set to the song ""Brazil"" (from the movie ""Brazil"").Those, alone, sold me on the film.See John Cusack out of a suit for the first time in his life. Watch ""Abelard and Heloise,"" the puppet show, with incredible marionettes. Watch John Malkovitch play John Cusack playing a geek. See deep into John Malkovitch's subconsious.",Being John Malkovich

The actors push this movie along quite well and, looking back on it, I remember my general expression being an open-mouthed, giddy, stunned smile, with a growing confidence that nobody involved in this movie was going to drop the ball while taking me places I have never been to.  ""Being John Malkovich"" is to any movie you have ever seen what Dali or Picasso were to impressionists or realists.  A quantum leap in creativity, with no peers in any recent art form.  It sounds like I'm laying it on a bit thick here, but I have never been this blown away by ANY artist's vision.",Being John Malkovich

What could have been a good movie was made astounding by the sheer audacity of having John Malkovich actually playing himself as a character (a brief jaunt through his subconscious made me wonder as to the honesty of it).  A full force tumble through someone's brain through the eyes of three very needy and occasionally cruel people.

The story takes a number of intriguing twists and turns. John Cusack turns in a great performance as an obscure and confused man.

657,trotsky-8,Goodnight everybody,10,29 December 1999,"This has to be the best film I have ever been fortunate to see in a movie theater. I found its unique devices innovative and refreshing. Blah blah blah. Its all been said before and I agree with it all... But there were two things about this film that stood out for me that I have not yet seen touched upon. The first is the film's ability to manipulate me exactly they way it wanted to, and with out me realizing it at first. The biggest form of this being my newfound desire to actually be John Malkovich, if only for a few minutes. There we so many different types of characters and despite all their differences they all wanted to be this somewhat obscure character actor. I soon began to honestly want to shell out my $200 to experience what it would be like to experience what none of us can ever do, not even with those closest to us, get inside someone's head and truly see the world from their eyes. This ability the film had also worked very well with the character of Maxine. Let's face it folks, this girl is not terribly easy on the eyes. Her face has some witch like qualities to it (the long, crooked nose, the large teeth, that mole on her chin), she was skinny (not slender, skinny) and boney and no fit for the role of the temptress in any other movie. But by the end of this film, through shear personality alone, she became a slinky, velvety, sexy vivacious and desirable woman. I really, really wanted her, and I could see why everyone else wanted her too. She was almost worth killing for. In other words the film made me understand the motivations of the characters like no other. The second unique part of the film was Malkovich himself and the fact that he played himself. This is a rare treat in films that is very hard to make possible. It's also a very brave thing to do. Unlike movies like ""Private Parts"" where the main character plays the lead in his autobiography, ""Malkovich"" is not an egomaniacal device to prove something to the world. Instead we get little snippets of what could be real experiences of the actor, often in portions of his life require excruciating vulnerability. This goes from such small snippets as childhood photos to scenes like that of young Malkovich sitting in a dark basement chanting about what a bad boy he is, or being taunted on the school bus. You are left wondering if these are real experiences or not. Either way the actor is defining himself (as he is playing himself) in less than flattering ways that make the audience look at him very differently. I think John Malkovich deserves so much of the credit for making this movie extraordinary.",Being John Malkovich

It carries two different tones hardly noticed by the un-watchful eye.  At first glance it would appear to be a comadie but is actually a deep picture that brings upon questioning of what happiness, and self-worth are.

How did they get Malkovich to make fun of himself like that? Wonderful! Everybody's favourite seem to be the ""Malkovich Malkovich"" scene.

Answer me this  How is this intelligent or creative!?  It sounds like a story I wrote in 1st grade.  Do people have such small minds that this is creative to them?  If so that's really sad.  My girlfriend fell asleep after the first hour and she was the lucky one.  My other friends and I sat in disbelief as we kept waiting for something to happen; it never did.

Being somebody elseSo this movie somehow shows us that most people aren't happy with their lives, in this movie they can be somebody else, but how about real life? This movie is somewhat to pessimistic in the relation to real life solutions of such problems, it just gives us a non-existing solution.

I think the great forte of Being John Malkovich is it's unique way of combining both avant-garde and humour( which is unfortunately not very often combined.)The film challenges and ""plays with"" it's viewers but it never escalates into something too grotesque( or pointless) I quite like Cusack's protagonist-the pathetic and egocentric puppeteer-he left me with a strange ambivalent feeling. Even though he might be considered extremely selfish, he isn't purely mean. The main characters aren't as stereotyped as in many other (American) films, they aren't just good or bad, but they all have less flattering sides. Being J.M. is excellent and surreal ( Craig's boss might as well just have stepped out of Lynch's universe), an entertaining look into the world according to Kaufman/Jonze and the darker sides of America.....",Being John Malkovich

However, how many people analyze a movie to that extent while viewing it?  I enjoy a movie that has a comfortable mix of interesting storyline and entertainment value.  Granted ""Being John Malkovich"" is imaginative in exploring the idea of being someone else but, I did not think the movie was entertaining at all.  The particular brand of humor was somewhat ridiculous. I thought that the cinamatography could have enhanced the ideas being conveyed.  I also thought the movie would have been more interesting if one or two ideas were fully developed rather than several aspects being merely glanced over.

So many questions were left.(Major spoilers ahead)Why wasn't there a bigger fight from John Malkovich when his head was being taken over? Who would pay to be in Malkovich's head? Nothing happens. Why was Orson Beane's character the ruler of Malkovich when all those people went with him? Why would they go for ""eternal life"" if they had no part in it? And why use a lame ""everyone's Malkovich"" when John Malkovich goes in his own head. Wouldn't it be better to have him facing his hidden selves, rather than being left to fleeting background in the Lotte and Maxine chase? Who DIDN'T know as soon as Orson Beane's character explained what would happen if you got in too late how the story would end?All in all a BIG waste of a GOOD idea.

The whole idea of the movie could have been made into something interesting, but was far from this. I found this movie in the comedy section, and it was not funny at all! It just weirded me out.

So he leaves his wooden puppets behind and plays the human puppet ""Malkovich"". But he cannot keep the secret. More and more narrow-minded characters jump into the broadminded, deprived character ""Malkovich"", starting as stalkers and ending up somewhat different. This happens in rhythmic alteration, the whole process being slightly but not to much commercialized. A highlight is the man ""Malkovich"" multiplying himself by jumping into himself, after having found out what is going on within himself. ""Malkovich"" becomes ""well used"" and ""abused"": well used by the two women - one of them being in ""Malkovich"" for this purpose - to create a daughter; and abused by the puppeteer riding him and mutating the famous actor into the famous puppeteer ""Malkovich"". According to its own morality the movie comes to a corresponding happy end: The abuse of the brain ""Malkovich"" will be terminated finally, the nameless puppeteer will be forced to leave it. Instead ""Malkovich"" serves further on deliberately as a ""vessel brain"" for a circle of elder people, thus preventing them from death.

It's turned into somewhat of a classic, and the reason is obvious - this movie is as controversial any movie can get. It makes us laugh on how the basic premise is idiotic and childish, and yet it fulfills the dream that many of us dream all the time - being a Hollywood celebrity, turning from ourselves - that even though sometimes, we could be successful, and have a great life - into someone we assume is better than us in every way. With its somewhat philosophical idea - do we really want to be someone we're not, change our lives, but risk our sanity, our way of life, our friends, our family - combined with great acting, humor-filled scenes, especially the excellent scene where John Malkovich enters his own head, and finds himself in the world where everyone are him, and speak the mysterious language of 'Malkovich', and the wonderful scene where Maxine tells Lotte that she is her baby's 'father', create what can only be called as a masterpiece, though its delusional, insane and irrational idea in every way - especially when you think about the finishing scene, where Craig enters the head of John Malkovich's daughter, and so creates some sort of an Edipal complex.

Each plot twist and visual device makes you sit up and pay attention.  Watching this movie was a great way to do what I like to do best when I go to a movie - escape.  The only reason I didn't vote it higher is because it's not a movie I'll pick up again and again; seeing it for one good viewing is the perfect way to do it.

Main person are John Cusack and Cameron Diaz and John Malkovich. At first I couldn't notice that puppeteer's wife is Cameron Diaz because of her ugly makeup.

681,RockinRickyRialto,The Best Movie About a Portal into John Malkovich's Head Ever Made!,10,18 November 2010,"Being John Malkovich, directed by Spike Jonze, probably gets better every time you see it. Screenwriter Charlie Kaufman is a genius when it comes to subtle foreshadowing, as well as thinking up with metaphysical comedies like this. But you might be wondering: what is the plot of this bizarre and brilliant movie? Allow me to elaborate.John Cusack is Craig Schwartz, an insecure puppeteer who gets a job working on the seven and a half floor (why would there be a floor that's only half as tall? ""Well, the overhead IS low."") of the Merton-Flemmer building in New York City. There, he meets seductive co-worker Maxine (Catherine Keener), who he finds much more attractive than his plain wife Lotte (Cameron Diaz); and Dr. Lester (Orson Bean), his quirky, 105- year old boss who drinks lots of carrot juice. For the first twenty-five minutes or so, we don't even get a mention of Mr. Malkovich, until Craig discovers a small door hidden behind a file cabinet containing a portal. That portal lets you go inside the head of actor John Malkovich (playing himself); to see, hear, and feel all that he sees, hears, and feels for about 15 minutes before being spat out onto the side of the New Jersey Turnpike. Craig uses this fantastic discovery for personal gain with Maxine, and Lotte becomes fascinated too. But, once Malkovich himself catches on, things really start to get strange.Yes, this movie is weird and slightly surreal. But Spike Jonze portrays it in a sort of quiet, low-key, realistic way, which makes the weirdness and comedy all the more memorable. If you're a fan of Charlie Kaufman (like me!), then you know that you do sort of have to suspend your disbelief while watching his movies. Granted, I found it a little hard to swallow that everyone in this movie believes Craig about the portal almost right away, but it's really just a stepping stone to keep the story moving along. The characters and acting are all great, and while I wouldn't really say that the humor is laugh-out-loud funny, it leaves you with a unique feeling and becomes more evident on every viewing. The movie isn't just clever and witty, it's often beautiful, with great production values (even if it is apparent at times that it was filmed in Los Angeles rather than New York--when Lotte falls onto the Turnpike for the second time, look in the background for some very Southern Californian palm trees.). The scene where Malkovich goes through the portal into his own head (A.K.A. the best scene in the movie) proves through hilarious means what a low budget movie can achieve with special effects nowadays.By the time the third act rolled around, I thought I had what was going to happen figured out pretty well, but then the already fantastic movie suddenly gives us a great antagonist and a great unexpected ending. Kudos to Kaufman, who makes sure no subplot gets left behind, not even one involving a chimpanzee.As for the title character/actor, John Malkovich is funny and superb as himself, going through all this craziness. People often call him the most sympathetic character in the story, but I would have to give that honor to Craig. Of course, other people will give it to Lotte, or Maxine, or Lester, showing how deep and ultimately unforgettable Being John Malkovich is.",Being John Malkovich

683,rissypants15,"Different, Deep but GREAT!!!",10,31 January 2010,"This movie starts off, right off the bat strange. You have no idea how someone could even come up with an idea for this. John Cusak plays a man named Craig who is married to a nutty crazy haired Cameron Diaz who is named Lotte. Lotte is a pet shop owner and she has about 20 pets living with her and Craig in an apartment in NYC. Craig is a puppeteer,well a struggling puppeteer he is unable to find work therefore he sometimes sets up puppet shows on the side of the road. One day after being nagged by his wife to get a job till puppeteering becomes more lucrative Craig see's an ad in the paper for a man with skilled hands. That leads Craig to this filing company run by a strange man named Lester. One of the woman Craig meets while working there is the sexy and mysterious Maxine, who Craig instantly falls for. While filing and working in his office Craig finds a portal(behind a filing cabinet). Craig ventures through the portal,which is a shlep through mud and muck, into the head of John Malkovich.After 15minutes in his head you get transported out and you land on the side of the New Jersey Turnpike. Craig tells Maxine of his findings and they start up a business where strangers can spend $200 to venture through the portal into the head of John Malkovich. Then Lotte tries the portal and soon sees she enjoys being a man. Maxine realizes she likes Lotte and when Maxine goes to sleep with John, Lotte decides to go through the portal and be John. Lotte soon sees she loves Maxine, but so does Craig. Therefore Craig locks her up in the monkey cage (Lotte has a monkey that when through a trauma when it was young) and Craig decides to be Malkovich every time Maixine is going to be around Malkovich. Craig then figures out how to control Malkovich, how to make him say and do whatever Craig wants. THAT'S WHERE SOME FUNNY STUFF GOES DOWN!Though this movie is not directed by a director like David Lynch, no one could have done this better. This has many points where this could be about real people, about what they think and want out of life. Though it does seem like a strange idea it really is funny and very honest no character lies to you and you can easily associate yourself with one of them. Whether it is Craig, who is always pushed around, Maxine who is commander and takes over, Lotte who wants to be loved, or Lester who fears death or even John Malkovich who has no control over his life, its a great movie with a hilarious cameo by Charlie Sheen who later gets called Charlie the ""Ma-Sheen"".",Being John Malkovich
684,ataylor0512,Being John Malkovich as a symbol for paradise,10,2 February 2010,"Being John Malkovich. So I looked around the internet (one google link) to see if what I thought was going on was what was actually going on and couldn't find anything close. I couldn't even find a synopsis, but I think i might be on to something. So, in line with the ridiculousness of the movie, I was thinking that living as John Malkovich is a symbol for paradise or heaven (for obvious reasons). The two main characters are like Adamn and Eve, they are innocent and pure and their love is innocent and pure (they never fight about anything). This is because of their detachment to the material world, they're totally unfashionable and seem like children. When the puppeteer has to find a job he has begun his dive into the material world and more importantly towards the advancement of himself. Maxene is like a symbol for the pure ego, sort of like Satan who tempts Adamn and Eve to eat the apple of knowledge, the apple being the idea of improving upon their already perfect paradise by living through John Malkovich. Maxene keeps them from realizing that what they had before was the paradise, and now after meeting her and using the portal they are constantly crying and hating each other. There are parts in the movie where Maxene is speaking to the two and they look awestruck by her, they are infatuated with her ego, her complete confidence and love of herself, which turns into an infatuation with their own egos through being with her, loosely the plot of ""Paradise Lost."" It's like nothing anyone says or does can effect Maxene's feeling of self-worth, she has an invincible ego, so she is not a human. The two main characters are constantly being defeated by the outside world (once they've joined it) and suffer as a result. There are also a lot of parallels between the puppeteer and Christ, and between the old people and God and his angels.",Being John Malkovich
685,Gam-El,I disliked this movie.,4,16 April 2003,"I just watched this movie, and I have to say, it's one of the worst movies I have ever seen.  I saw it because it had many good reviews.  All the way through the movie I kept thinking it would have to get good, how could so many movie reviewers be wrong?  But it never got good.  The monitor just continued spewing the same garbage off the screen.  I lost respect for a lot of movie critics while watching this movie.  How can so many people believe that this is a good movie?  The top things I look for in a movie (in order) are:1. Good Story-line/Plot2. Directing/Camera Movement3. Symbolism, Metaphor, or other uses of Allegory4. Intelligence5. Acting SkillI'll admit that the acting wasn't THAT bad in this movie, but the plot was down-right awful! The directing was basic at best, and I saw no sign of literary devices.  And there was absolutely no intelligence! Before I saw this movie I still had respect for Cameron Diaz.  Now whenever I watch ""Something About Mary"" (not a GREAT film, but fairly good) I can't stop thinking about her role in this lousy movie.  The only good part of this movie, was that the puppeteering was kind of cool.  Other than that, this movie was a complete waste of my time.",Being John Malkovich
686,korgy,"outstanding and original premise, less-than-perfect resolution - still unusually captivating",9,22 June 2003,"Like other screenplays by Charlie Kaufman (e.g.: Adaptation), this movie has an excellent premise, the intriguing idea alone of which is enough to hold the viewer captive for about 2/3rds of the movie.Though some other viewers seem to think the over-the-top plot is too far-fetched and nonsensical to be believable enough to hold ongoing interest, i disagree. i have seen the movie 3 times, and indeed, the details all make sense. However - i qualify this praise by saying the accelerating weave of turmoil that takes place about 2/3rds the way through the movie does begin to get a little tedious - one wishes Kaufman would have stuck to the simplistic beauty of the original idea without getting so hallucinogenic. 1 or 2 subplots is enough, not 5 or 6. And the cinematic reference to ""Rosemary's Baby"" is cute, but totally unnecessary.That being said, i still gave the movie a 9 rating for the originality and interest of the idea alone, and the excellent casting and production techniques. This movie far surpasses Kaufman's ""Adaptation"", (which simply falls apart because of it's over-reliance on the ""cleverness"" factor.)",Being John Malkovich
687,cnrlndr,Amazing,8,27 April 2011,"The move Being John Malkovich is now instantly one of my top favorites. The thoughts behind this film are so large, powerful, and thought provoking, as well as being a film that can evoke just as complex thoughts for the viewer. The cast is equally as phenomenal as the film, especially John Malkovich. Next is the awe inspiring and beautifully done cinematography and editing. The whole setting of being realistic and ordinary and making something extraordinary come out of it, is fantastic. Being John Malkovich is a brilliant and instant classic. The first subject I would like to talk about is the concepts behind the movie. The major concepts are actually quite close to that of another recent movie title Inception. The idea that we can enter someone else body/mind, and that we can be in control and live in another persons reality is what this movie is about. Yes they use a portal to get to that and that's where we know that this film is fiction and not real, But the idea of experiencing life through another person is reality. The incredible plot twists are what i love about this movie. It gets you to think outside of the box put keep you close enough to reality to make you think that this is, or could be, believable. It never loses the theme of human nature and the drive for love, That's why we get dragged into any movie, it's our ability as a viewer to relate, and empathize, to the situation and the characters in the film . Empathy is the act of feeling what another is feeling, being able to share that experience, that's what this movies about, being someone else, and feeling what they are feeling. That thought I think creates love, or an admiration about having something you can't have, and being someone you've only dreamed of. Being John Malkovich is a phenomenal film, It left me satisfied in the end, and the last 3 to 5 minutes of the film are very climatic. It really starts for me when every one leaves John Malkovich and all the old people go in, it then cuts to Craig where he's telling Maxine he still loves her while she and Lotte drive off. they then fade away almost making Craig seem like the bad guy. Then it cuts to the ending pool scene (which I will not ruin). I believe it is the key to the movie, and one of the best endings I've seen. It made me want to cry but at the same time I couldn't because I understood the meaning of the movie. Go watch Being John Malkovich, it's amazing!",Being John Malkovich
688,dimitrakos_1992,"It's clever, witty, dark and, most importantly, unwaveringly bizarre.",8,23 September 2013,"Spike Jonze's wittily-written, incredibly acted comedy drama about a disgruntled but ambitious puppeteer who to his amazement finds a peculiar, mystical portal into the mind of John Malkovich, is a brilliantly surreal and mind boggling experience. It's profoundly original dream-like narrative exploring humanities selfishness and one's desire to be something else makes it constantly entertaining and builds up to an utterly unforgettable cinematic experience. Charlie Kaufman's clever yet non self-indulgent script creates some very awkward but hilarious situations for the characters and flawlessly disguises the insane feebleness and fantasy of the story and it's characters infinitely believable. He went on to work with director Michel Gondry and wrote his masterpiece; Eternal Sunshine Of The Spotless Mind, which I think is one of the best films ever made. He is arguably one of the most talented art-house writers out there today and although he makes very few films the one's that he does work on are always brilliant. In the interesting case of Being John Malkovich, performance-wise it is perfect, Cameron Diaz and John Cusack advertise some fantastic chemistry, but the greatest stand-out is easily John Malkovich who is just perfect and undeniably engaging at being/playing John Malkovich. Catherine Keener is also great as the bitterly inhuman anti-hero, and Jonze's outstanding direction nails the film as a landmark. I think it's one of the best directorial debuts of all time, and if your not laughing at it, or being moved by it, you'll certainly be admiring it. It's a strange and emotionally detaching screen presence but in my opinion it's one of the best of it's kind. Endlessly fascinating and completely extraordinary.",Being John Malkovich

Some of the little details are hilarious - just for example - when Cusack ties up Cameron Diaz, the chimp is kissing her, and you can just make out her kissing the chimp back, underneath the tape. Malkovich's depiction of having Cusack speak, within him, is classic, along with his physical comedy. It's a triumph for him. There are so many little tidbits like this, that it would take hours to detail them all.

Main difficulties are regarding voyeurism, immortality, identity and sexual covetousness. The whole movie is an evolution starting with voyeurism in general to voyeurism in its strongest occurrence concerning real prominent persons in particular. It then raises questions of identity, who we want to be and how we can achieve what we desire, just to open out and close with the deep human wish of immortality paired with its negative side of endlessness. Along the way 'Being John Malkovich' puts this in a surreal and kafkaesque setting. This excelling movie is often underrated by the audience, while still being above the ordinary.

Later on, things start to get creepier as the newly-employed Mr. Schwartz finds a secret door that leads to John Malkovich's head, with unexpected consequences involving the Schwartzs and an attractive employee in the same floor named Maxine (Catherine Keener), or a highly laughable and meta-linguistic sequence when one dares to cross the door to its own perception (no pun intended).All in all, this is a very original and amazing movie which starts out pretty well but, in the end, it lacks a tad more of rhythm and gets a little repeating, but in no way predictable and unparalleled in Hollywood standards, indeed.",Being John Malkovich

I'm not a fan of anyone in this movie (except for Diaz and she was unrecognizable and acted at her worse), but i did look for the movie genre which got me to watch it.There were funny parts in the very beginning like when the secretary could not hear, and his boss thought he had a speech impediment, but after that i found myself beyond confused. 1, because the man i began to like in the movie as an awkward puppeteer trying to earn a living, turned out the be so unlikable for being so comfortable with cheating on the woman who said she wanted to have kids. 2, the woman he fell in love with was conceded and a home wrecker who only cared about herself. I didn't like her and didn't find her demeanor humorous. 3, his wife fell in love with this woman and wanted to be a man, what kind of plot twist, i was not interested in the hilarity i was meant to find in that situation because it was more sad that funny (especially because the gun got involved twice... serious not funny) 4, something i said constantly throughout the movie... Why john Malkovich, he's old, unattractive (like everyone else in this movie), creepy, and irrelevant in comparison to most celebrities.All i wanted to say was Why Why Why??? This movie was dreadful. The worse part is, the one innocent man who was being used, the one i would label the protagonist, Malkovich, will forever just be a vessel. The bad guys win? What? No i don't find that to deserve a comedy genre title.",Being John Malkovich
700,margosmith,Weird Movie,5,14 January 2007,"This is the weirdest movie I have ever seen. I really like John Malkovich and that is why I rented the movie. For that reason it was interesting. But talk about weird. You just have to see it to know what I mean. There is really no explaining it. The most interesting thing to me is to think about what kind of mind would write such a screenplay. That person must be really interesting and creative. Well, this site is requiring me to write ten lines and I can't write ten lines about this weird movie so I'm not sure I will be able to submit this comment or not. I am trying to write ten line. I am trying to write ten lines. I am trying to write ten lines. I am trying to write ten lines. I am trying to write ten line. I am trJ4BK to write ten lines.

701,TrickerTreater,"Not absurd, but boring.",1,29 November 2005,"Terrible jokes, ""the bad kind of genius"" cinematography, and too many mixed metaphors and plot twists make BJM a mess. Just because it's art doesn't make it good. Honestly, when it was over, I felt cheated.Don't believe the hype. It's an honest movie with a somewhat neat idea that gets so bogged down in metaphors and imagery and camera work and stuffy philosophical ideals and egos and ids and projected ideas of self and... Sorry, I nodded off there for a second. It's got so much baggage it looses the story and worse, the audience. The ideals are lost on most people and they end up thinking it's quirky, absurd, or funny. Not like Frank Zappa weird, but Tom Green weird. I'm a professional artist and I have friends who love this movie. I make a living by making connections others don't. I got the ideals of the movie, I just don't think is anything close to ""the best movie of the last 10 years."" If you want odd, see ""Blue Velvet"" (odd and disturbing) or ""Pete & Pete"" (odd and funny) re-runs.",Being John Malkovich
702,wavycaver,Excellent Film,10,30 May 2006,"Not having a 9.5, I vote 10. Its just about as good as a film can get. When a film is completely immersive, then it is great. When a film leaves me in a completely altered state, it is fabulous. (Of course this is totally subjective.) I was so caught up in this film that when it was over, I literally could not find my way out of the theater! That is the degree to which I became immersed and altered! There are only three or four films that have ever done that to me. I cannot seem to find any flaws to this film which left me completely surprised at each twist and turn. From each absurd parody of life's mundane reality to the unreal bending of fantasy stretched to its breaking point - this movie accomplishes what few have! I loved it.",Being John Malkovich
703,iuli19792003,For a long time I didn't see a movie so good,10,10 February 2006,"Being John MalkovichWhile I was working at my animated project with my two characters of wood it happened. I started watching the movie "" Being John Malkovich "" attracted by the reality of the puppets and their movements. The strongest part of the movie, which I considered the best, was the part in which the puppet turns towards puppeteer, as a creation towards his creator. Another part of the movie that caught my eye was the show of human sized puppets. I don't really know if it was real or not, but it could be interesting to see a show with puppets and actors in which to be unable to make the difference between the real actor and puppet.It could be interesting. Another ideas which I considered genius are : the introduction of the seventh and half floor (a floor at half the size of an original floor), but also the hole which leads inside Malkovich's mind,part in which Malkovich enters inside his own mind entering inside of Malkovich world and also the pleasure with which the puppeteer plays with his own puppets (the fact that he was living through them,it was not an spectator,it was an accomplice to what was happening between puppets) . What I understood from this movie is that you need to be yourself .The way in which this was presented is genial ,for a long time I didn't see a movie so good,to be so impressed. On one discussion with my colleagues about movie, at my surprise, I found out that John Malkovich didn't write the script of this movie, but someone introduced it to him, and he was impressed of it and agreed to play in this movie about him.This seemed very strange,because many times,artists get upset when someone tries to characterise them or something like that...seems that Malkovich is special from this point of view. The actors have played their roles good...but something else what happened to me after watching this movie was that I could not remember anybody's name. They just all seemed familiar including John Malkovich.Also from my discussion with my colleagues after watching the movie I understood that it happened to some of them the same thing,the movie being intentionally with actors of this type,which everybody knows them,but nobody remembers their name,John Malkovich being one of them.In conclusion, I enjoyed the movie""Being John Malkovich"",it is a well created movie,starting with the idea,scenario,actors,chromatic and the list could go on.For a long time I haven't seen such a good movie.It was an enjoyable experience watching this movie.-this comment is by Radu M.

704,jsherry73,"As Maxine says, you can split people into two groups",10,20 July 2006,"Being John Malkovich is fun and original. It oozes creativity without being pretentious. I found myself grinning throughout (even in the dark scenes), which only happens when I really connect with a film.As much fun as I had watching this film, however, my comments will focus primarily upon the ideas I believe Kaufman was trying to illustrate, because I cannot accept that this movie was intended solely as a wild, thoughtless ride for the audience. Through the many visits inside the head of Malkovich, Kaufman is inviting us to explore our own minds, which most of us do not like to do. The question this film can lead us toward is whether or not we are like its characters. So many of the characters, like Craig and his wife and all the people who line up to be John Malkovich, are portrayed as pathetic. They show how most people are truly unhealthy and unsatisfied. We often feel lost and are secretly more than willing to control others if it will help us fulfill our desires. And if we can't get what we want through controlling others, we can try to get it through our fantasies--or by living through other people. I don't think this film is about our longing to be another specific person so much as it is about our longing to escape our own sad lives. We often wish to escape our destiny, or even our mortality.Of course, some people spend more time longing for a different life than others. Maxine's role in the film is to show us someone who is self-assured, and her strength sets her apart from the rest of us who often feel insecure and unsettled. Her beauty and confidence is what we want. The struggle at the heart of the film is whether we are capable of recognizing our shortcomings and then either accepting them or making the changes necessary to overcome them. Most of us can do neither, and end up like Craig, continually trying to live through others.So the question is: Are you more of a Craig or a Maxine? And don't just focus on who you'd like to be.",Being John Malkovich
