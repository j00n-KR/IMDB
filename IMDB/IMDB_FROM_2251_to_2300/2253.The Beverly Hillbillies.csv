0,SnoopyStyle,Ridiculous Rob Schneider makes this even worst,4,1 June 2014,"Jed Clampett (Jim Varney) shoots and discovers bubbling crude from the ground. Jed decides to sign for a billion dollars and move from Arkansas to Beverly Hills for Elly May (Erika Eleniak) to be more ladylike. They move with Jethro (Diedrich Bader) and Granny (Cloris Leachman). With that much money, everybody is aiming to get a piece especially the weaselly Woodrow Tyler (Rob Schneider) and his gold digging girlfriend (Lea Thompson). Jed is looking to get hitched to help raise Elly May as a refined lady. Milburn Drysdale (Dabney Coleman) and Jane Hathaway (Lily Tomlin) are from the bank.It was a cheesy TV show to begin with. They don't change the tone of the movie from that too much. This is simply stupid. Rob Schneider is too ridiculous. He is too far gone. Lea Thompson's fake french accent is annoying. It may be better if the people outside of the Clampetts be normal. They don't have to be nice, just normal. In today's world, they should be Duck Dynasty teaching the Kardashians how to live. There is some of that in this movie, and that's where the movie works best. The Clampetts should never be stupid other than Jethro. For example, Morgan Drysdale (Kevin Connolly) would be so much better as a shy geeky nerd. Elly May could teach him to stand up for himself and they can fall for each other while she gets picked on by the mean girls. And Rob Schneider as usual is the bad egg. He makes this so much worst.",The Beverly Hillbillies
1,mark.waltz,"If the oil is pure crude, than the comedy is pure corn!",5,26 May 2020,"While Hollywood studios certainly aren't known for their originality in many years, every so often, they can be unorgininal and come up with something sweet and amusing. The story of the Clampetts of the back hills of Arkansas striking oil and moving to a Bel Air mansion was a major hit on TV for nearly a decade from the mid 1960's way into the 1970's, and the movie version of that series (much better than the TV movie follow-up from 1981) is a mixture of sweet and sour as far as the film as a whole is. Certainly, in casting the Clampetts, their kin and banker Mr. Drysdale and Miss Jane Hathaway, they hit paydirt, starting with Jim Varney as far from Ernest as possible, delightfully charming as Jed Clampett.Who better to play Granny than Cloris Leachman who has been playing eccentric characters ever since Mel Brooks put a mole on her chin and gave her a name that meant glue factory? Erika Eleniak as Ellie Mae and Diedrich Bader as Jethro are picture perfect, if not as experienced as actors as the elders, and Dabney Coleman and Lily Tomlin are a delight as Drysdale and Hathaway. They give great tributes to Raymond Bailey and Nancy Culp yet are never imitating or mocking them. Penny Fuller is adequate in playing Mrs. Drysdale in the way that she is written, but lacks the uppity bubble head that Harriett MacGibbon brought to the role.The basic story is nothing we saw on the long-running CBS sitcom, utilizing Jed's desire to find a wife to help Ellie Mae become a lady once he is fully ensconced in Beverly Hills society. A scheming junior executive at Drysdale's bank begins to scheme with his gold-digging girlfriend to trap Jed into marriage, but Granny and Jane realize what's going on, and do their best to stop the wedding. Pairing Leachman and Tomlin to be cohorts together is comic genius, and they steal, individually and together, dominate every scene that they are in. They play on Jane's crush on the delightfully dumb but sweet Jethro, and it is obvious that Lily Tomlin is having a ball playing this part. Bader seems to be enjoying his goofy character, and doesn't hesitate in going totally over the top in drag as Jethrine. In fact, he is quite lovely! Linda Carlson is perfect as mother Pearl.As for Leachman, I wish she had something more substantial to do than just be the  of visual gags throughout the film (exposed while in an outhouse, her rocker being knocked off the Clampett truck with her on it, driving a motor bike, the exposure of her hairdo after she is given shock treatment), but Leachman makes the best of the material that she has. But it is Varney who is the heart and soul of the film, giving Jed a romantic sophistication that was absent from the original series. Buddy Ebsen is the only cast member to make a cameo, playing his later TV role of Barnaby Jones in a classic moment.Where this fails to be funny is its efforts to spoof contemporary life in Beverly Hills and the American culture in general, although there are a few moments that stand out as funny. They include a cameo by Zsa Zsa Gabor as herself, the howdy salute that the Clampetts use to greet those verbally assailing them on the 101 Freeway, and the onslaught of gold-digging females (of all ages) who apply for the role of Jed's wife. Other attempts at parodying what they wanted to believe life in L.A. to be like fall flat and come off as condescending rather than funny.The scenes of Drysdale's son taking Ellie Mae to high school are particularly obnoxious and are excuses to go to the refrigerator to get a snack. 90210 this is not. Those moments seem totally forced. The main story of Jed's attempting to find a wife plays off a little better with the beautiful Leann Hunley (""Days of Our Lives"", ""Dynasty"") playing a Drysdale client who has a misunderstanding with Jed over her horse stud farm in an amusing cameo. The ""Nine to Five"" reunion between Coleman and Tomlin is made more complete by a cameo of Dolly Parton, singing ""Happy Birthday"" to Jed as herself. (""They spent a fortune on me for you...."") Her singing of ""If You Ain't Got Love"" is another great highlight.The build-up to the wedding is fraught with a mixture of tacky and hysterically funny comedy with one political reference creating a bellyache of chortling. When I saw this in the movie theater, that moment got the most laughs outside of Leachman and Tomlin. The good fortunately outweighs the bad here, and seeing this again nearly 30 years later, I found myself smiling in delight at most of it. One thing I wish that these film versions of sitcoms would do would be to stop taking the original theme and make them into a tacky rap song, or in this film's case, a badly written country song that has nothing whatever to do with the series or what you just saw in the movie.",The Beverly Hillbillies
2,lee_eisenberg,"not terrible, but it unfortunately led to terrible things",5,30 September 2012,"It's become a cliché that modern adaptations of classic TV shows are among the worst movies of all. ""The Flintstones"" was simply a BAD movie in every way! While there have been a few bright spots (""The Addams Family"" and ""Charlie's Angels"") pretty much everything else has been execrable.This modern adaptation of the Clampett brood has some funny stuff but mostly isn't worth the time. One could make the argument that ""The Beverly Hillbillies"" is half-homage, half-parody. Even so, this was a letdown for Penelope Spheeris after ""Wayne's World"". It was interesting to see Jim Varney in a non-Ernest role, though.Also starring Cloris Leachman, Erika Eleniak (the girl kissed by Elliott in ""ET""), Lily Tomlin, Dabney Coleman and Rob Schneider.",The Beverly Hillbillies
3,ccthemovieman-1,A New Beginning And Ending Would Have Really Helped,5,21 February 2007,"I enjoyed the bulk of the film - the middle part. It was just the first 20 minutes and the last 20 minutes that I thought were incredibly too stupid to enjoy.In that middle segment, Diedrich Baker's and Lily Tomlin's facial expressions were the highlight. I didn't mind staring at Erica Eleniak and Lea Thompson, either! It is an entertaining cast, I'll give it that, with Jim Varney, Cloris Leachman, Dabney Coleman and Rob Schneider among others. There also is some very good country music in the soundtrack, too.Otherwise, there isn't a whole lot of positive things to say because, really, much of the humor is Dumb, yes - with a capital ""D.""",The Beverly Hillbillies
4,ma-cortes,Cinematic adaptation from known TV series with minimal story but some moment is entertaining,5,2 November 2007,"This film based on successful TV series by Paul Henning. It begins when mountaineer Jed accidentally discovers a surprise in his property because he has struck oil during a shooting, gotten million of dollars, and turning instantly billionaire . Then he packs his backwoods family and heads to Beverly Hills, Los Angeles, California.They change into a lush mansion , but still live like Hillbillies because they still dress tattered ragged suits and rustics costumes .The hillbillies clan are Jed(Jim Varney in the role of Buddy Ebsen), a good-hearted and kind father looking new spouse, his daughter Elly May(Erika Elinak, role of Donna Douglas),an extraordinary gorgeous but incredibly ingenious and pursued by a suitor(Kevin Connolly), the Granny(Cloris Leachman), a senile, paranoid and obstinate old woman and Jethro(Dietrich Vader, role of Max Baer) , he's idiot though strong, he's actually only acting like an authentic stupid and doesn't even realize it. Besides, the ambitious banker(Dabney Coleman) and his botcher helper(Lily Tomlin) who will make anything of keep the Camplett family money in his bank. Meanwhile, they are duped by a mean pair(Lea Thompson and Rob Schneider).Everyone casting does rightly their impersonations from television characters with special mention of Jim Varney as the sensible and good father looking for wife and particularly, Dietrich as a double role as the dumb Jethro and his sister, furthermore a likable Granny, well incarnated by Cloris Leachman. Appear special cameos, Zsa Zsa Gabor as a delinquent, Dolly Parton singing country music and Buddy Ebsen, the original Jed , reprises another of his television acting, Barnaby Jones.The film contains a stunning music score with ballads by Scoggins like the original series, songs by Dolly Parton and Hank Williams and soundtrack by Lalo Schifrin. The motion picture is regularly directed by Penelope Scpheeris. Rating: Average but amusing. The film will like to nostalgics and hardcore series fans.",The Beverly Hillbillies

6,preppy-3,Silly,4,6 March 2003,"I have to admit that I've never seen a full episode of the TV series. I've seen bits and pieces of enough to know the basic premise and the characters.This is just to let you know that I'm reviewing it without comparing it to the TV series. But still--with the silly premise who ever thought this would work as a full length film?The Clampetts strike oil, become billionaires and move to Beverly Hills. An evil bank assistant (Rob Schneider) and his girlfriend (Lea Thompson) plan to swindle them out of it all.There's very little plot, even for 90 minutes. There are some good jokes but most range from lame to insultingly stupid. It's all up to the actors to carry this off. Luckily, they're up to it. Deidrich Bader is very good as dumb as dirt Jethro (and his sister)--he's full of life, engaging and has a great smile. Dabney Coleman is good but given nothing to work with as Mr. Drysdale. Erika Eleniack is cute and perky as Elly May--she can't act but she was hired for her body not comedic talent. Cloris Leachman is good but a little too loud as Granny. Lilly Tomlin is hysterical as Miss Hathaway--she looks great and provides the few true laughs in the film. The late Jim Varney is surprisingly very good as Jed--who would have thought? Schneider and Thompson try to be funny but their material is very poor. Guest appearances by Buddy Ebsen, Dolly Parton and Zsa Zsa Gabor (in a VERY dated joke) don't help.With a better script this could have been great. As it is, it's almost worth seeing for the actors (especially Tomlin). Maybe the TV series is better...",The Beverly Hillbillies
7,view_and_review,What in Tarnation!?,2,14 June 2020,"""The Beverly Hillbillies,"" as is known, was a T.V. show from 1962 to 1971. I never watched the show, it was before my time, and if the 1993 movie is an accurate representation, then I don't know how it lasted that long.TBH movie was abysmal. It was a terribly unfunny string of absurd situations. Even for 1993 the idea of unrefined ignorant rednecks moving to the cultured and affluent Beverly Hills was old schtick. Naturally, such a mixture of polar opposites was supposed to produce laughs abound. Even with an ideal script and directing we would have gotten maybe a few chuckles. So, what do you think the laughter was with the weak script and weak directing it suffered from? Yeah, zero laughter is right.",The Beverly Hillbillies
8,Uriah43,From the Ozarks to Beverly Hills,6,16 April 2021,"This film essentially begins with a poor, uneducated mountaineer living in the Ozarks by the name of ""Jed Clampett"" (Jim Varney) shooting at a rabbit and accidentally finding an extremely rich vein of oil on his property. So at the encouragement of some relatives he decides to move to Beverly Hills where he hopes to transform his daughter ""Elly Mae Clampett"" (Erika Eleniak) from a tomboy to a refined young lady. Along with Elly Mae he also takes his mother ""Granny Clampett"" (Cloris Leachman) and because the three of them lack any formal education he rectifies that by bringing his nephew ""Jethro Bodine"" (Diedrich Bader)-who has graduated from the sixth grade--along as well. Needless to say, once they arrive they face a complete cultural shock-as does everyone they meet in Beverly Hills. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that this film had some really humorous scenes and some excellent acting on the part of several performers. I especially liked Lily Tomlin (as ""Miss Jane Hathaway"") and the aforementioned Diedrich Bader who played their parts extremely well. Where the director (Penelope Spheeris) lost her way, however, is when she inserted certain scenes and dialogue of a sexual nature for cheap laughs. Not only was this totally unnecessary but it was definitely not in the spirit of the original television series. Even so, I still enjoyed this film for the most part and I have rated it accordingly.",The Beverly Hillbillies
9,FlashCallahan,Californy?....,6,14 July 2014,"Jed Clampett and his family move from Arkansas to Beverly Hills when he becomes a billionaire after striking oil. The country folk are naive with life in the big city, so when Jed starts a search for a new wife there are inevitably plenty of takers and con artists ready to make a lot of money.....Okay, so it's not the best thing in the world, the TV series never really did anything here in the UK, albeit being on a few times after CITV, and at this time in cinemas life, the movie adaptation of a TV was in full swing,thanks to the major success of the previous years 'The Fugitive'.But the makers of this didn't take into account that that film had a brilliant storyline, narrative, and two cracking central performances.Here, much like The Flintstones, released this year too, relied on the name to put bums on seats, and then work the script around the title. The Flintstones failed miserably, as it aimed too high and was more high profile. This is as laid back as the depicted family, and although it's very silly, and utterly forgettable, it's still a bit of dozy old fun.The cast are okay with what they are given, and Varney and Tomlin act everybody off screen. Eleniak is just eye candy, and proves why she never made it big in Hollywood.Schneider and Thompson are the obligatory bad guys, and seeing Thompson in a small role, in a decidedly dodgy movie is pretty depressing, but all in all, its summer fluff.But if you see on TV adaptation from 1994, go with Maverick, its a hoot.",The Beverly Hillbillies
10,Wuchakk,Movie version of the popular TV show,4,5 October 2015,"Released in 1993, ""The Beverly Hillbillies"" is a cinematic version of the hit TV series that ran for a decade from 1962-1971. The story details the family of hillbillies from the Ozarks striking it rich and moving to Beverly Hills where they're strangers in a strange land.I've never really watched the TV series, although I've of course seen clips here and there. Unlike 1994's ""The Flintstones"" and 1995's ""The Brady Bunch Movie"" and their sequels, ""The Beverly Hillbillies"" isn't nearly as effective, not even close. The cast is good and there are amusing moments, but once the family moves to Southern California the story is uninvolving and you find yourself biding time waiting for the next gag. Sometimes it's downright bad, but there's enough good to glean for a mildly fun time. Lily Tomlin, Erika Eleniak, Lea Thompson and Leann Hunley are enjoyable.The film runs 92 minutes and was shot in Beverly Hills, Pasadena and Los Angeles, CA.GRADE: C (a very weak ""C"")",The Beverly Hillbillies
11,Sylviastel,I only wish there was more of it!,9,20 July 2005,"I liked this film version of the television show because it makes me laugh on a rainy day or when I am having a bad day. The casting is excellent. I feel that Jim Varney plays an excellent Jed Clampett. I wish there was a sequel when he was still alive. Sadly, he's gone. I think we saw him apart from his Ernest character a lot more in Jed. He seem to feel right at home in this character. Cloris Leachman is a hoot as Granny and I really felt that she enjoyed the role. Erika Leniak does an actually good job as Elly May Clampett. She seems to fit at right home with the role. I liked Diedrich Bader as both Jethro and his twin sister Jethrine. Bader is really an excellent comedic actor. I thought Lily Tomlin played Ms. Jane Hathaway in her own updated style. I felt this Jane had more gusto than Nancy Culp did in the series. Dabney Coleman is always fun to see and in this one as Drysdale. I liked him and Tomlin together. I liked Penny Fuller as Mrs. Drysdale and Kevin O'Connell who plays their son, Morgan. I felt Morgan and Elly could have gotten together. I liked Linda Carlson as Jethro's mother. I wished she was on more. Rob Schneider and Lea Thompson really do a good job as con-artists after the Clampetts. But I really enjoyed watching this film to see the stars like Zsa Zsa Gabor, Miguel Ferrer, Buddy Ebsen as Rockford, Dolly Parton, etc. Their cameos made it worth while to see them. It's nice to see Zsa Zsa poke fun at herself on screen in anything.",The Beverly Hillbillies
12,sddavis63,The Brief Cameo By Buddy Ebsen Is The Biggest Highlight,5,2 March 2013,"Hollywood has produced uncountable numbers of remakes of old TV shows from the 1960's and 70's. I can't even begin to count them or make a list. I've seen some of them. A few have worked; most have been dreadful. This 1993 movie based on the 60's series of the same name falls somewhere in between those two categories, probably leaning a bit toward the dreadful side, but not dreadful in and of itself. The basic plot follows the TV story. Hillbilly Jed Clampett (played here by Jim Varney) strikes it rich one day when he was ""shootin' at some food, and up from the ground come a-bubblin' crude. Oil that is. Black gold. Texas tea."" (Couldn't resist!) Suddenly rich after he's paid $1 billion for his land, his family tells him that ""Californy is the place you ought to be, so they loaded up the truck and they moved to Beverly. Hills that is. Swimming pools. Movie stars."" (Couldn't resist again!)So, once more Jed, Granny (Cloris Leachman), Ellie May (Erike Eleniak) and cousin Jethro (Diedrich Bader) are left to the task of settling into their new life with the help of Mr. Drysdale (Dabney Coleman) and Miss Hathaway (Lily Tomlin) and along for the ride we get a couple of villains played by Rob Schneider and Lea Thompson, who set out to get Jed's money for themselves.This lacked the fun of the TV series. There were parts of it that were amusing. The Clampetts driving along the highway thinking that the middle finger was a California greeting springs to mind, for example. Overall, though, it really wasn't that funny. The cast was so-so. Varney and Leachman were all right. Eleniak, to me, didn't really capture Ellie May's sweet innocence, and Bader as Jethro didn't work for me. Jethro in the TV series was a dumb character, yes, but Bader's Jethro was both too dumb and too underplayed. Bader seemed to think he just had to look and sound stupid and that would be enough. He missed the mark completely. I don't think the Beverly Hillbillies work that well as a movie, either. As a TV series it was fine. You got it in half hour chunks (less counting commercials) and that was enough. Trying to keep it going for over an hour and a half without a break became tiresome after a while.Dolly Parton was included as herself as, I guess, an entertainer the Clampetts (with their country background) would be familiar with. Aside from being recognizable, though, that didn't really do much for me, since I'm not a big Dolly fan. One appearance that did work, though, was from Buddy Ebsen. He, of course, was the original Jed Clampett on the TV series. It was a rather ingenious thought to bring him back for this movie, this time as the other well known character he played on television - private detective Barnaby Jones from the 1970's, whom Miss Hathaway hires to investigate the plot to get Jed's money. When the Barnaby Jones theme started to play I smiled, because right away I knew what (and who) was coming. Ebsen played it perfectly straight, when everyone else often seemed to be trying too hard for laughs. As a result, he was perfect.It's not the worst remake of a TV series. Not by far actually. But it can't honestly be called good either, and with the TV series being just perfect at a half hour per episode, this started to get tired even before the one hour mark had hit. There just isn't really enough meat to the Clampetts to make a movie about them. (5/10)",The Beverly Hillbillies
13,Edvis-1997,7,7,9 March 2021,"It's my childhoob classic. I grow up with this film, I liked it, it enternaited me so it did purpose fine. Can't give it less than 7. I would recommend to watch this film because it's quite funny, maybe, in nowadays, it will look simple and basic, but it's cute.",The Beverly Hillbillies
14,FiendishDramaturgy,A Movie As Lovable As The Series Which Spawned It.,7,3 September 2004,"In the spirit of the original series, this beloved production possesses one attribute no other movie can claim: a believable, serious, and endearing dramatic performance delivered by Jim Varney. Having lived in the southern US for years, I learned rather quickly that there is a stark distinction between the hillbilly and the American redneck. Hillbillies are more family oriented, while rednecks seem to care more about the toys theyhave and keeping up with Bubba (the southern American version of Keeping Up With the Joneses). Bubba has a rad gun collection; a shiny new truck complete with roll bar, wench and lift kits, mud-flaps and tires large enough to get you out of the mud bog with a truck bed laden with deer carcasses.Frankly, I was amazed at the quality of performance contributed by Mr. Varney. I (as was most of the world) was under the mistaken impression that Ernest was the best this actor had to give. What a grievous error! It is, indeed, unfortunate that Mr. Varney was not to be with us much longer after this attempt. I have missed the Ernest movies, to be honest, but I was also looking forward to another dramatic beneficence from him. This attempt was done with love, executed with a witty tongue-in-cheek delivery, and presented to those who held the series in regard with a more than capable star-studded cast. While the wit was at the expense of a group of people who should be respected for their deep country philosophical ideals and witticisms, so was the series. Frankly, if you didn't like the series, I see no reason to watch and then dog this movie.Cloris Leachman was a joy as Granny. She gave us the same sort of tenacity and spirit as did Irene Ryan. Her performance was delightful in spite of the somewhat small stature of her character.Diedrich Bader's Jethro was cleverly drawn from instinct and heart. Rather than one dumb crack after another, he relied greatly on facial expression as well as physical comedy to entertain his audience; a very wise decision on Bader's behalf considering he is not moron. And as this is his first screen attempt, you will see a strong pattern of characters throughout his career to this point which demonstrates his commitment to perfecting this type of role. Erika Eleniak as Elly May (Playboy model-cum-actress) was the only thing which disappointed me with this production. I believe that she tried and gave her best, but she just wasn't Elly May. I expected to feel that way about Jed or Granny, but not Elly May. Her work here was a bit stiff, in my opinion. I remember that her performance as a Playboy bunny in Under Siege was a little stiff, too. I do not know if her talents as an actress have progressed since this attempt as I've never cared to watch anything else in which she's been featured.Lily Tomlin and Lea Thompson were both dead on their characters. Although Tomlin's character was preconceived and Thompson's was a one-time plot element, they both contributed above-par performances in this work. And, true to the series, there's always some shifty character trying to take the Clampett billion away from Drysdale; enter Rob Schneider. Some critics have stated they did not understand his character's presence in this endeavor, but it fit right in with the theme of the television series. He was entertaining, delivered a good performance, and more importantly...he was funny.Dabney Coleman is Milburn Drysdale in every way, shape and form. He could have been the original participant in the series, as far as I'm concerned. He turned in an impeccable performance here.Although the story line was good, I felt it could have had a little more depth. However, the touching moments between Jed and Elly May appeared to be heart felt and honest, lending a very endearing quality to this production. The most important point I could make here is simply that Jim Varney was (and is) the best thing about this movie. Even if you aren't a fan of his Ernest franchise, you will still enjoy his performance in this movie. This was far superior to his previous performances in any other work.It rates a 6.8/10 from...the Fiend :.",The Beverly Hillbillies
15,PWNYCNY,Wonderful movie,10,22 July 2007,"What a wonderful, silly, entertaining movie! Diedrich Bader is especially hilarious as Jethro/Jethrine, but everyone in this movie is funny. The Clampetts are great. They are the kind of people that one should have as friends. Not only are they nice, they will treat you as a friend. Jim Varney was perfect as Jed and we cannot forget mentioning Dabney Coleman whose performance as usual added to the humor. This is an unpretentious, humorous, entertaining movie and the kind of movie that is not only watchable but provokes nonstop laughter. This special movie compares favorably with the sitcom. Both are humorous without being nasty and both show that nice people can actually finish first. If you enjoy nonstop laughs then this movie is for you.",The Beverly Hillbillies
16,davispittman,"Not the best remake, but entertaining",7,23 February 2017,"This 1993 film adaptation of the classic TV show from the 60's is moderately entertaining. The casting is perfect. Cloris Leachman, Lily Tomlin, Lea Thompson, Rob Schneider, and, Dabney Coleman are all great in their portrayals of the characters. The dialogue is very much like the show in many ways, with of course some modern updates. The sets and costumes are perfect, just like the show. The comedy is moderate, in some scenes it's obvious that they are trying too hard by the abundance of slapstick and crude comedy, but in other scenes I think the comedy worked and was suitable given the show it's based on. I loved the lea Thompson/Rob Schneider marriage money stealing plot line, I thought they made a good pair of bad guys. The movie as a whole is good innocent fun, especially if you were a big fan of the old television show. I give The Beverly Hillbillies (1993) a 7 out of 10 stars.",The Beverly Hillbillies
17,gcd70,Dreadful Transition,2,31 March 2008,"Oh no, not again! Yes it's yet another classic t.v. favourite forcing itself upon us on the big screen. This time it's the good ole""Beverly Hillbillies"" who have made what I call without hesitation the 'dreaded transition'.The new cast, led by Jim Varney (Jed), Diedrich Bader (Jethro), Erica Eleniak (Elly May) and Cloris Leachman (Granny), with support from Dabney Coleman, Lily Tomlin, Lea Thompson and Rob Schneider, all manage to resurrect the familiar faces of the Clampett clan, but apart from that they do little.And as for the plot, which is damn near awful, it seems to have borrowed rather form ""The Addams Family"" and ""Addams Family Values"", with its story of deceitful persons attempting to get their hands on the Clampett fortune. All amounts to an incredibly corny, unfunny show that's as flat as a pancake. (How does it take four writers to come up with this drivel? Perhaps less is more?). Funniest moment occurs during the closing credits which feature some of the film's bloopers.

This spoofy reboot of a simple mud slinging family that stumbles upon some oil and moves to Hollywood is loaded with heart as well as some effective comedy hijinks. Jim Varney (Ernest), Erika Eleniak (Under Siege), Lily Tomlin (9 to 5), Cloris Leachman (Mary Tyler Moore show) and hunky Diedrich Barber (Miss Congeniality 2) steal the show.

21,Mister-6,And they say Hollywood's running out of ideas....,6,27 August 1999,"As long as there's television, the motion picture industry will outlive the human race.Of course, ""The Beverly Hillbillies"" may be an argument for looking elsewhere for inspiration.Don't get me wrong: I am a big fan of the ""Dumb and Dumber"" school of laughs from which everyone in this film obviously graduated.  When used well, they can be a powerful tool in the war against boredom.From the looks of it, everyone here graduated Magna Cum Laude from this school.  Varney, Leachman, Bader, Eleniak, Coleman, Tomlin, Thompson, Schneider, et al.; they would do the Farrelly Brothers proud.As general entertainment goes, however, it does leave something to be desired when a movie simultaneously insults both hicks and non-hicks in equal turn.  I believe in equal opportunity laughs, but only when the laughs are there.Gotta hand it to Cloris Leachman, though; you know how everyone thought Val Kilmer channeled into Jim Morrison's spirit for ""The Doors""?  Leachman must have used the same psychic friend to get hold of Irene Ryan. Uncanny.Six stars.

There has been some bad ones, Mod Squad,Avengers and Charlie's Angels to name a few, but The Beverly Hillbillies is one of the most enjoyable. Mildly typecast, Jim Varney does a great job emoting Jed Clampett while not copying Buddy Ebsen and Cloris Leachman looks so much like Irene Ryan that it's downright uncanny. Under-appreciated Erika Eleniak is one of the few actresses that could bring Elly Mae to life while Diedrech Bader (The Drew Carey Show) pulls off a fair Jethro while not exactly looking the part established by Max Baer Jr. of the big over-sized giant. Lily Tomlin and Dabney Coleman reunite from ""Nine to Five"" as My. Drysdale and Mrs. Hathaway. Even their old friend Dolly Parton joins them looking better than ever. Lea Thompson and Rob Scheider drag down the script as two would-be con artists, but even with them, the movie is one enjoyable ride through nostalgia as they cross paths with Buddy Ebsen as Barnaby Jones. I guess Baer and Donna Douglas were unable to do cameos or ended up on the floor in editing. Even still, the movie's a worth-see.",The Beverly Hillbillies

Moynahan, Mike Norris....Director Penelope Spheeris, Screenplay Paul Henning, Lawrence Konner, Mark Rosenthal, Jim Staahl, Jim Fisher.Released in 1993 from Director Penelope Spheeris, a female director at a time when there weren't many of them, this was the Beverly Hillbillies movie, based upon the classic 60's comedy. Because more than one writer worked on the script, and because the cast was a pretty talented group of comic actors - Jim Varney (He was the ""Hey, Vern!"" guy, Ernest in various comedy films in the 80's) Diedrich Bader (he would be a regular on Drew Carey), Cloris Leachman needs no introduction and neither does Lily Tomlin. Plus, there are cameos by Dolly Parton, Buddy Ebsen, the original Jed Clampett and Zsa Zsa Gabor. The premise is the same, except this time the setting is in the early 90's. Jed Clampett (Varney) discovers oil in his Arkansas mountain home and becomes a millionaire over night. He moves his family - daughter Ellie May (Erika Eleniak), cousin Jethro (Diedrich Bader) and his elderly grandmother (Cloris Leachman) to Beverly Hills, at a time when it was still hip and elitist, the zip code to billionaires. The Clampetts put their money in the bank of Milburn Drysdale (Dabney Coleman) who becomes their financial planner. Jane Hathaway (Tomlin) becomes their accountant. But another couple - Laura and Woodrow (Leah Thompson and Rob Schneider)have set their sights on taking the Clampett fortune. Laura poses as a French teacher to Ellie May and wins Jed's heart, making him propose marriage. With one click of a computer, she can get his money to her Swiss bank account. Will the Clampetts end up on top ? This movie is entertaining and one of those comedies that require good acting and plot and it's not just visual jokes or tawdry jokes. Few comedies are made like this nowadays but still, Beverly Hillbillies was one of the many good comedy films of the early 90's which saw films like ""Don't Tell Mom The Babysitter's Dead"" ""Encino Man"" and the Ace Ventura Pet Detective films. The film does not contain adult content and the language is not offensive, so it's entertaining for the whole family, but it got a PG-13 rating because some of the jokes go over the heads of smaller children who wouldn't understand.",The Beverly Hillbillies

Next thing widower Jed knew he was a billionaire with more money than any of us would ever see. But simple-minded Jed wants nothing more out of life than a wife to tame his young tomboy daughter Elly May (Erika Eleniak  Playboy). So he packs up his kinfolk including Granny (Cloris Leachman) and Jethro (Diedrich Bader) and heads for Beverly Hills to get his daughter some refinement. But these simple folk soon become the target on unscrupulous city folk who want nothing lea than all their money.This sweeping southern epic that lays ""Gone with the Wind"" to shame.Oh who am I kidding. I couldn't say that with a straight face if I tried. ""The Beverly Hillbillies"" is a fun in a ""throw your brain out the window and pass the popcorn"" sort of way. The TV show (far from a classic, but well loved) gets a modern reworking that would suit the fans (yeah you in the back) just fine.

27,headhunter46,A slightly updated version of an old classic TV that was wholesome viewing.,7,25 June 2006,"The cast of this movie did a very good job of resurrecting SOME of the aspects of the original TV series. The simple, honest way of approaching life, trusting others to do the same, and respecting other people as equals. As one other commenter noted, I felt the one finger salute by the whole family cheapened the image of the Clampetts. Supposedly, they didn't know what it meant but it didn't belong in the movie in the first place. Also the tobacco chewing was degrading. Wasn't needed and it detracted from the rest of the movie. I enjoyed this movie for the most part, and had a few good laughs. A few times the acting by Jethro was a bit too hammed up but in all the folks did a good job. If this movie encourages just one person to seek out the original TV series it will have been a good thing.",The Beverly Hillbillies

29,samcracc,very hysterical and a great movie,10,28 June 2007,"I would say Jim Varney (Jed Clampet) Cloris Leachmen (Granny), Erika Eleniak (Elly may Clampet) Diedrich Bader (Jethro Bodine) Lily Tomlin (Miss Jane Hathaway), and Dabney Colmen (Milburn Drysdale)did a great job. I have seen this on ABC family in April I like that movie. His bloodhound is sometimes lazy but he was hunting a jack rabbit Jim Varney is similar to Buddy Ebsen. DOlly Parton did very well with this song called If you Ain't got love. Jim Varney did very well in the Hot Rod Lincon. It's actually different then the TV series. In the Beverly hillbillies movie it was terrible that Larua Jackson wants to steal Jed Clampets money. My favorite part when the orangutan spanks Larua Jackson's butt. One part must of been a problem with getting hitched. Jethro Bodine was hysterical.",The Beverly Hillbillies
30,Junker-2,One of the worst movies ever made,1,8 September 2000,"Yes, I said ""One of the worst movies ever made."" And even that might be praising it too highly. Because unlike a ""Plan Nine From Outer Space,"" ""The Beverly Hillbillies"" doesn't even have that ""it's so bad it's good!"" quality. BH is just so bad it's bad.Understand that I was a fan of the TV series. I was actually looking forward to seeing the movie! What a terrible disappointment.What's wrong with it, you ask? Really, just one thing: It isn't funny. I didn't laugh one time. How in the world could we have Dabney Coleman and Lilly Tomlin (not to mention Jim Varney, Cloris Leachman and several other genuinely talented people) in the same movie and come up with absolutely zero laughs?And now if you'll excuse me, I'm going to go dig out my copy of ""Ishtar.""

31,jvfunn1,One of my favorites,10,24 May 2009,"After watching The Beverly Hillbillies Movie and being a big fan of Jim Varney I fell completely in love with this movie! One of my favorites! In the movie Jed Clampett(Jim Varney) becomes a millionaire and moves his family, daughter Ellie May(Erika Eleniak) mother-in-law Granny(Cloris Leachman) and nephew Jethro to Beverly Hills and he's looking to get hitched and falls in lobe with this woman(Lea Thompson) hoping that she'd be perfect to raise his daughter not knowing that she and her partner(Rob Schneider) in of his great character roles are planning to steal his money! Filled with hilarious scenes including the scene where the guy in the jeep say Hey! Nick wheels Buddy! and flicks the Clampetts off and Jed asks Jethro why do you suppose that fellers pointing at us? And Jethro answers Reckon that's how they say howdy in Californie! And then later they do it to Mr. Drysdale(Dabney Coleman) not knowing who he is! That was really hilarious! I just jumped out of my seat laughing! I also liked the scene when Dolly Parton shows up to sing Jed Happy Birthday and Jed(Jim Varmey) smiles with delight! It was just wonderful! Filled with hilarious scenes, bloopers, great story, and wonderful actors and actresses Beverly Hillbillies is one of the greatest movies ever! I will always Charisse the memories of one of the greatest actors in this movie Jim Varney! God bless you Jim Varney 1949-2000! 10 out of 10!",The Beverly Hillbillies
32,jwhale9382,New hillbillies for a new generation,7,15 April 2005,"I admit, I was never a serious fan of the TV show, at least not until after I saw this movie. But in my opinion, this movie may have helped reintroduce the story of the Beverly Hillbillies to a new audience. I loved it.Plot: It all starts when Jed Clampett discovers oil on his property. Then Aunt Pearl convinces him to move to Beverly Hills. What am I saying? Y'all know the story. It's the same story as the TV show. That's one of the best things about this movie; that it stays true to the TV show. In addition, Jed has decided to come to Beverly Hills mainly to ""get hitched."" Now this sounds like a funny story.Cast: The actors were probably one of the biggest aspects of the movie. The cast was funny, but also believable. The late Jim Varney (Jed) was great in one of his best ""non-Ernest"" roles. Dabney Coleman (Mr. Drysdale) was convincing in his role. He probably got the experience from doing ""9 to 5,"" which also starred his co-star Lily Tomlin. Lea Thompson and Rob Schneider (Laura and Tyler) play two cons who are trying to steal the Clampett fortune. They should've known better than going up against the Clampetts. There were many other great and hilarious performances from stars like Cloris Leachman, Erika Eleniak, and Diedrich Bader.Humor: There was the prefect balance of humor and seriousness in this movie. And the crude humor was low. If there was too much stupid or crude humor, it would've brought down the whole movie. But there was just the right amount of humor, so the movie was good.This one may be a bit too much for the younger viewer, unless it's been edited for a few bad jokes. I recommend this one for anybody who just wants to see a funny movie.",The Beverly Hillbillies

35,Eightiesjunkie,"Great cast, Lame script.",5,15 August 2014,"""The Beverly Hillbillies"" was a very well known and popular sixties TV show, that many people grew up with, and still enjoy to this very day. The show was about a very rural, and country family, who strike oil on there land, become immensely wealthy, and move out to the big city in California. Basically, it was ""a fish out of water"" story. However, the problem with this TV to movie adaptation is this: ""What works in a TV show, won't work in a movie."" You can't have a movie run on just one premise! A film's plot requires much more than that. The plot of the film is this: a sleazy con-man finds out about The Clampett's massive fortune, and he and his girlfriend devise a plan to steal all of their money, and The Clampetts and their friends must stop them. I really don't need to say anything else, because that's all that goes on in this movie. The plot is nothing new, and as a matter of fact, this movie, ""The Addams Family"", and ""Addams Family Values"" have the exact same plot! many of the jokes are flat, and unfunny. Not to mention, the film is as predictable as can be. It's a shame how the movie turned out. Especially considering how extremely talented the cast is! Jim Varney, Diedrich Bader, Erika Eleniak, Dabney Coleman, Lea Thompson, and Rob Schneider, all give very good performances. The film fails, because of its weak script, and rehashed plot. Despite all its flaws however, I will give the film a few positive accolades: The cameo with Buddy Ebsen (Who was the original Jed Clampett by the way.) was very funny. But most of all, the film did not make a mockery of what the original series was, nor did the film parody the original show. Which many TV- to-film remakes do. I'm very thankful that the writer/writers and director chose not to go with either of those options, and I tip my hat to them for that! So, here's what it all comes down to: ""Is The Beverly Hillbillies a bad film?"" No. ""Is it a great film?"" No. It had a lot of potential to be a great film, but it suffered from very poor writing. The best thing that I can say about this film, is that out of all the recent TV-to-film remakes, this one is the least bad. None of the TV-to-film remakes have ever come close to capturing the spirit or magic of the original series, and this film failed as well, but I must give credit to this film for actually trying.",The Beverly Hillbillies

37,bug76,"Wooo-Weee, VARNEY!!",10,27 March 2011,"While others seemed quite surprised at Varney's dramatic performance as Jed as being excellent(most associate him with lovable Ernest P. Worrell), I was not surprised. I love the Ernest character and the entire Ernest genre. With Varney being able to pull off a multitude of characters and voices(over 61), I wasn't shocked at his performance as the serious Jed Clampett. It was refreshing to see him play the straight role while the comedy was happening around him. I've always wanted to see Varney in dramatic roles as well and knew he had it in him to do so. Varney was the perfect choice for Jed and no one could've done better. Ebsen should be proud. I must admit, I was so used to seeing Varney as Ernest that I WAS shocked when I saw 'Jed' come down the stairs in a black hat, white shirt and black pants. The first thing I thought was, ""Weeeee, Doggie. Sexy."" I couldn't help myself. I'm from Alabama, and I know that the accents were somewhat forced on some parts like Elly Mae's but Varney's was dead on. Since he was born in Kentucky and lived in Tennessee, how could it not? With Tomlin, Parton and Coleman, it felt like a 9-5 reunion. Bader playing the moronic Jethro cracked me up especially when he 'figured' out how to bowl. Leachman as Granny was perfect. Being such a small little thing, she has a big personality. I remember watching her as the witch in 'Hansel and Gretal' and just loving the performance. Another hilarious scene was how the Clampett's gave everyone on the interstate the bird because they honestly thought that was how people said hello in 'Californy'. One of my favorite parts was when two hooligans come up beside them after being cut off by Jethro, and pull a gun. Jed stands up, points a huge rifle at them and says, ""That's real nice, son. This here's what I carry."" The two guys speed away. I grew up watching some of the reruns of the original 'Beverly Hillbillies'. And the movie is a nice parody of the original, but keeping true to the story and characters. Jim sang a version of 'Hot Rod Lincoln' and it was just excellent. Not only did he had a wonderful singing voice, he was also very articulate. I recommend this movie. If you're a Varney fan then I highly recommend you get this and enjoy!!",The Beverly Hillbillies

39,missy_baxter,A great antidote for the blues -- hilarious!,10,6 July 2001,"This is satire at its funniest.  When I first saw this movie in 1994, I was really depressed and it cheered me right up.  So, the following year, I was feeling blue again and saw this for sale for $10 and bought it, and it cheered me again. There is no rocket science here (except of course, for Jethro), just enough flat-out absurdist satire to make me laugh and laugh and laugh. Extremely true to the spirit of the original, this is very well-performed and totally irreverent.  Cloris Leachman, Lily Tomlin, and Elena Ereniak are standouts as Granny, Miss Jane, and Elly Mae, actually improving slightly on the originals which I didn't think possible.  Buddy Ebsen is marvelous in a cameo as Barnaby Jones, and Linda Carlson makes a terrific Cousin Pearl. Junior Drysdale is also enjoyable. {Penny Fuller was very bad as Mrs. Drysdale, but it's a minor role.} Dietrich Bader is a great Jethrine, and a fair-to-middling Jethro.But, the real revelation is the late Jim Varney (incredible to think that he is dead for five years while Buddy Ebsen is still with us). I HATE the Ernest movies, and was expecting the worst.  But Varney, actually captured the soul and spirit of Jed Clampett even better than Ebsen if possible.  He is magnificent in the role.  What a pity he died so young!But, every time I watch this gem of unreality-TV (to steal Nick at Nite's brilliant catch-phrase), which I have done 10 times so far, Varney's best performance ever lives on in my heart.",The Beverly Hillbillies

Lea Thompson's character is in almost every scene. Which is disappointing. I don't care for her, and she should not be center stage in a hillbilly story.Using Lea all the time turned the rest of hillbilly characters into supporting actors.In spite of the negativity, I still encourage people to see it, just for a silly break. Life is hard enough, enjoy some silliness in your life. And at least get to the credits where you can see the outtakes and the actors laughing together and playing together.You shouldn't have to wait until the ending credits and out takes to feel a connection to the characters, but that's what it takes.

But the writing for the other characters was awful and the acting was either awful or possibly well performed to an awful script. The main objection I have to the film is that it is demeaning to hillbillys.

The Beverly Hillbillies was another such series that got ruined on the big screen.The Beverly Hillbillies on TV was a sweet little comedy, with funny characters in a fish out of water situation. Even when the show went downhill later on, there was an innocence about it.In the big screen version of The Beverly Hillbies we see such treasures as: The Clampetts are in the truck and while driving by a tree, Granny in the rocking chair, gets knocked off the truck onto the road.The Clampetts on a Los Angeles Freeway flipping people off.Granny gets placed in an insane asylum and stoned on God knows what, only to be rescued by Miss Hathaway, in the end we see them crashing Jed's wedding in the Clampett family truck that has somehow been rigged to look like the show vehicle, Bigfoot. Truly awful.The Clampetts kith and kin fly to Californy and there is a rather disgusting scene where the whole family is spitting. Classy.While the original Hillbillies was not Shakespeare by any means, the actors who created these memorable character deserve better that this piece of swill.For some reason I actually paid for a movie ticket to see this schlock fest when it came out in movie theaters.

So, I had to watch this movie, no matter who was in it and regardless of how good or bad it was.Honestly, I did not expect much. I fully expected a contrived sub- par plot with actors playing roles that they barely understood. But, what I got in this movie was a pleasant surprise. It was brilliantly cast and remained true to both the premise and the spirit of the original. And, that is the best anyone can expect to do when making a movie continuation of an iconic television series. No, this is not an opportunity to ""improve"" upon the original - this is an opportunity to give a salute to the original. And, that is what this movie does.Dabney Coleman plays an admirable Milburn Drysdale. Cloris Leachman plays a wonderful Granny. Lilly Tomlin had Jane Hathaway down pat. And, Jim Varney shines as Jed Clampett, as though he were destined to play the role. Diedrich Bader and Erica Eleniak reprised the roles of Jethro/Jethrine and Elly May convincingly well.True fans will recognize story elements from several of the original episodes, evoking fond memories and making one long to watch the series all over, again.One regret I have about this film is that the death of Jim Varney precluded a sequel - no one could have matched his performance as Jed Clampett, except Buddy Ebsen. They had seven years in which they could have done a sequel and they missed their opportunity. That is a sad shame.

They tied Grannie to a chair because she did not want to leave. When they are driving to Beverly Hills, people are very mean to them but they have no idea! The family thinks that the people are being nice. There is a lady that teaches the blonde girl how to be more ladylike. This character's name is Lara Jackson and she is really trying to steal the family's money. You should watch this movie and have all your friends watch it, too!",The Beverly Hillbillies
53,Ricochet84,"Not bad, not bad at all.",7,4 June 2009,"While this movie is not NEARLY as good as the classic TV series, I thought it was very well made. And I thought the cast (with the exception of Jethro and Miss Jane Hatheway) did a mighty fine job of recreating the characters. Jedediah (Jed) Clampett 7/10 I of course liked Buddy Ebsen better, but Jim Varney does a good job of playing this billionaire hillbilly.Daisy (Granny) Moses 9/10 Before I watched this movie, I thought to myself ""Nobody can replace Irene Ryan"". I was right. Sort of. Cloris Leachman did a very, VERY good job. If not for Ryan before her, she would have been perfect. But, as perfect as she was, Irene Ryan was not just a perfect Granny, she WAS Granny Clampett.Jethro Bodine 3/10 Max Baer Junior was better. Way better. The replacement was too corny, and stupid. (Baer was corny and stupid too, but in a funnier way. Not in this new...Jim Carrey way.)Elly May Clampett 12/10 ;) Believe it or not, I actually liked the replacement better. Donna Douglas exaggerated the role a little too much for me. And the new Elly had a more rugged look to her. Whereas Douglas looked too much like a beauty pageant contestant, and not someone who had spent their life ""rassling"" with the ""critters"".Pearl Bodine 8/10 She was in it very little, but she did a good job. Again, it would have been a great job if not for the original.(names fail me. lol)Milburn Drysdale 6/10 Not bad, but the replacement was a little old.Miss Jane Hatheway 2/10 Yikes! I did not like her at ALL! She tried to hard to act like Nancy Kulp, refusing to recognize the fact that it is IMPOSSIBLE to act like Nancy Kulp! She exaggerated the role WAYYYY to much! (so did Kulp, but with her it came out funny, and it fit her character. With the replacement, it came out...exaggerated!)Storyline 6/10 The plot is similar to the plots of the original episodes: Jed wants to get ""hitched"" so he can have a wife that will raise the rambunctious tomboy Elly to be ""proper"", Elly likes to ""rassle"", swim in the cement pond with her critters, and climb trees, Jethro tries to be a ""Hollywood bachelor"", Drysdale, aided by his *faithful* secretary, struggle to keep the Clampett account safe in the Commerce bank, and con-men of all sorts try every means possible to swindle money out of the Clampetts, all the while being unknowingly foiled by the Clueless, Trusting Clampetts. The only drawback is that the misadventures tend to be more on the PG side rather than the Family-Friendly TV series of the 60's/70's. (okay, a LOT more)All-in-all, I give it seven stars out of ten stars, and I recommend it as a must-see for any Beverly Hillbillies fanatic! I mean, fan.",The Beverly Hillbillies
54,gn65283,Out of the whole clan of the Clampets only two make the cut,3,18 April 2007,"I was excited when this movie was announced because I had been raised on the reruns. I walked into the theater sat down and was prepared to be entertained. Actually, I was very disappointed. Only the characters of Granny and Jedd were worth their salt. The character of Jethro had been dumbed down to an absolute idiot and Ellie Mae became more of a tomboy than was ever present on the show. Jim Varney did a very good job, I would have to say Buddy Ebson had to have been proud, especially since he had a cameo in the movie. Cloris Leachman was an OK Granny, I went in disappointed because when she tried out for the part she had yet to have seen an episode. Also, I am from the Appalachian area of North Carolina so I know what mountain talk sounds like. Everyone but Jim Varney absolute butchered the Southern dialect, it wasn't even funny. All in all the only thing you get out of this is a good job by Jim Varney and very vague resemblance of the television show.",The Beverly Hillbillies
55,nelson1978,"I saw Tom Green's ""Freddie Got Fingered."" This is worse.",1,15 October 2021,"This movie left me speechless.Congress should make a law that no movies can be made that are based on popular TV sitcoms. LOL.Find me anyone who watched the TV series called ""The Beverly Hillbillies"" who liked this movie. Anybody!It wasn't funny. The actors tried, but when someone gives you a script that has no humor in it, what are you supposed to do?The only good thing about this movie is that it should give anyone who dreams of writing a movie script to go ahead and write it! It couldn't possibly be worse than this. LOL.I saw hundreds of people who are listed as making or appearing in this movie. They should all either legally change their names, or retire. LOL.People like Lily Tomlin and Dabney Coleman try, but this script is hopeless. I can't believe that Paul Henning had anything to do with this, although his name is listed in the credits.But seriously, can you think of one Hollywood movie that was actually funny that was based on a popular TV comedy series? LOL.Please. Pass the law. The sooner the better!",The Beverly Hillbillies
56,pcutler,ye gods this stinks,1,19 January 2002,This movie is in the unique position where by it both sucks and blows.....it really is that bad. IN fact I will stick my neck out here and say that this is the worst movie I have ever seen. I just dont understand how when there are so many other opportunities to spend a few million quid some one saw fit to spend it making this  .....shame on you Hollywood!!!!!,The Beverly Hillbillies
57,acriser15,Great movie!,10,16 September 2007,"I watched this movie from beginning to end and it was great! Seeing it in 2007 really brought back the memories from seeing it when it was released in 1993. For the most part it was funny and it had some great actors in it and was enjoyable to watch. It was a good remake of the original Beverly Hillbillies TV show. Most parts of this movie I liked and it had some good stuff in it. The music was good and I thought it really brought the movie to life and what the film is about. However, I don't understand why this film is rated so low? I know that it wasn't a big picture but it should be given some credit for being a good movie and I highly recommend it. Very watchable!8/10",The Beverly Hillbillies
58,Inceptor5,Liked the movie( Jim Varney Fan),10,9 December 2004,"I thought this was just another example of how good Jim Varney was. The movie was funny and held to the nature of the original show. If you like Jim Varney and want to see a very funny show I recommend it. I couldn't wait for this movie to be released on DVD. I only wished now the one Jim Varney made called Earnest P. Worrel's Family Album would be released. I liked the Earnest Movies for example: Goes to camp, Saves Christmas etc... But this movie I feel like is much better.If you liked the old TV series this Movie will bring back memories, I didn't think they could find another as good as Buddie Epson for Jed Clampet but see for your self Jim Varney did a wonderful job. I will have to rate this one high on account of good clean FAMILY movie.",The Beverly Hillbillies
59,teenymeany,"Super Silly, But Enjoyable",9,13 February 2016,"I think this movie is hilarious. It's very goofy and silly, so if you're expecting an incredibly thoughtful plot, prepare to be disappointed. All of the actors were amazing, and it looked like they had a fun time with their roles. It was refreshing to see Jim Varney in a role different from the Ernest movies, Diedrich Bader is a total hoot as Jethro and Jethrine, and Cloris Leachman is a hilarious Granny. I don't really understand why it has such low reviews, it obviously isn't the most fantastic movie in the world, but it certainly is lovable movie that gets me laughing every time, which I think counts for something. It may be a little different from the original series, but if you accept the movie as a separate entity from the series, it's quite enjoyable. Overall, if you want a lighthearted,silly movie to make you laugh, this is a great one!",The Beverly Hillbillies
60,amy-66966,Where can I watch this movie???,10,8 August 2021,"I don't understand why this movie is unavailable on all streaming apps? Yes, it got some bad reviews, so what! There are some of us out there that actually liked the movie. It's funny and the actors were great! The bloopers were the best I've seen in awhile. Please bring it back or tell me where I can watch it? I looked it up online and it said the full movie was on YouTube, Disney +, Hulu & Prime Video. ALL LIES!! I'm so frustrated cuz I just don't see why out of ALL the dang movies out there that THIS particular movie is unavailable. Can someone help me please? I guess I'll have to buy it on DVD lol cuz this is just ridiculous or just my luck lol. Who knows? Lol.",The Beverly Hillbillies
