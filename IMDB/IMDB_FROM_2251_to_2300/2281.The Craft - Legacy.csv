0,Leofwine_draca,The pits,1,24 October 2021,"The original movie was no great shakes but this follow up is a million times worse. Everything is awful here, from the direction to the writing and the performances, and it all builds up to a preposterous climax that would have been rejected from CHARMED for looking too weak. Pity poor old David Duchovny, stuck making this junk since X-FILES ended.",The Craft - Legacy
1,nogodnomasters,Your difference is your power,7,10 November 2020,"The film starts out with 3 needing a fourth for bridge and a coven. Once they get four their powers increase until this go bad. The legacy comes in when Fairuza Balk appears in the film. Don't blink.The initial film was an unexpected cult classic which launched careers. Often copied. Never equaled. The legacy was tamer than the first film with less suspense and tension. Still it was entertaining while it seemed to have ended too soon. Their battle with the other side needed to be longer with a better build up.Guide: No swearing, sex, or nudity.",The Craft - Legacy
2,kosmasp,Not a remake,6,7 March 2021,"Or reimagination for that matter. No this plays in the same universe the other movie (the original) exists. And therefor it may think you know certain things from the original. So while there are some callbacks (the flowing body, but without all the explanation to name one that is part of a compilation), many things are new here.What isn't new is that we again get a set of witches ... 4 because of the 4 directions we have: North, East, South and West. The bonding sort of works in this movie too and the dialog is really good. But since this is not just a rehash, it has a different emphasis (on family). You'll either find that intriguing and good or not so much.I personally really liked the beginning, that was full of woke moments. It may have been a bit too much political correctness - it all will depend on how your views on feminism are I reckon. The theme could have been explored further, especially concerning how boys treat girls - unfortunately not in the best way many times. But I think that wouldn't have made or be in the interest of the majority of the viewers - I guess that would be the reason the producers did not go along or further with that.Having said all that, the ending is a bit dissapointing even if we get some nice surprise at the very end",The Craft - Legacy
3,jboothmillard,The Craft: Legacy,4,2 November 2020,"The Craft is a good glossy 90s movie, and 24 years later they decided to make a follow-up, it was unclear if it was a remake, reboot or sequel, but I was up for trying it while cinemas were open, before a second COVID-19 lockdown came along. Basically, three teenage girls, Frankie (Gideon Adlon), Tabby (Lovie Simone) and Lourdes (Zoey Luna) try to use magic to freeze time but fail and realise they need a fourth member. Lily Schechner (Cailee Spaeny) moves to the town with her therapist mother, Helen (Michelle Monaghan), to live with Helen's boyfriend Adam Harrison (David Duchovny) and his three sons, Jacob (Charles Vandervaart), Isaiah (Donald MacLean Jr.), and Abe (Julian Grey). Lily is befriended by the three girls when she has her period during class and is mocked by her other classmates. Then they are amazed to see Lily telekinetically push classmate Timmy (Nicholas Galitzine), who was teasing her, into the lockers. The girls communicate with Lily using only her mind, the girls confirm she is a witch and ask her to be their fourth member to form a coven. She agrees to join them, and they chant together to cast their first spell, and they succeed in freezing time. Seeking revenge on Timmy for being nasty, they cast a spell on him. The next day, Timmy behaves sensitively, confirming the spell is successful. They continue to experiment with their powers, including levitation. When Adam discovers about the incident in school, he scolds Lily, but Helen defends her. Lily goes outside after hearing Adam and Helen arguing, Abe is there to talk to her about his father being authoritative. Timmy hosts a party, inviting Lily and the others, he apologises to Lily and becomes friends with the coven. The five of them spend time at Lily's house, they all make confessions about their pasts, including Timmy who is tearful confessing that he had sex with Isaiah, and that he is bisexual. Later, Lily places a love spell on Timmy, and they share a kiss. The next morning, during class, the teacher tells everyone that Timmy has allegedly committed suicide. Lily opens up to her friends about the love spell and kiss with Timmy. Believing that Lily caused Timmy's death, the girls cut ties with each other and bind themselves from magic. Following Timmy's death, Adam displays aggressive tendencies, and Lily becomes concerned he is dangerous. After failing to convince her mother that they must leave, she searches Adam's office for something incriminating, only to find her down adoption paper. Helen is forced to confess that Lily is adopted and is the child of one of her patients. After Timmy's funeral, Helen tells Lily she agrees to move out. She also confesses that she knew Lily may develop powers and asks Lily to give her powers to her. Lily is suspicious that her mother would never say that to her, and Helen shapeshifts, revealed to be Adam in disguise, he is part of a pagan cult and is after her powers. After being knocked unconscious, Lily wakes up in a forest at night with Adam, who confesses that he murdered Timmy, and threatens to kill her next. The spirit of Timmy communicates with the girls through a Ouija board and tells them about his murder and Lily being in danger. They arrive in the forest and freeze time to save Lily, but Adam subdues them quickly. The girls then work together and use their elemental powers to defeat Adam, burning him to death. Lily and the girls continue their friendship, and Helen takes Lily to an asylum to meet her biological mother, revealed to be Nancy Downs (Fairuza Balk). Also starring Hannah Gordon as Ashley, and Chris Tomassetti as Jeremy. The four young leads are all fairly good as the coven members, while Duchovny is the slightly too pantomime villain, the spell casting and dark moments are mixed but get your attention, it is not as slick, stylish or glossy like the original, it could have been better, a below average teen supernatural horror. Okay!",The Craft - Legacy
4,paul_haakonsen,Where was the magic?...,4,29 October 2020,"Granted, I did not have high hopes for ""The Craft: Legacy"" when it was initially announced, and I dreaded the outcome of it. And sure enough, the movie was a weak imitation of the original 1996 ""The Craft"" movie.Writer and director Zoe Lister-Jones failed utterly to bring something worthwhile to the screen, as ""The Craft: Legacy"" just felt like a watered down more family-friendly version of the 1996 movie. And that was just an abysmal turn for the movie to take. Especially since the 1996 movie was pretty good and impacting back in the day.I am sure that ""The Craft: Legacy"" was meant to be a continuation of the 1996 movie, but it just failed at being an original movie in its own right, and it had none of the charm, appeal or impact that the 1996 movie had.Sure, if you haven't seen the 1996 ""The Craft"" then I suppose ""The Craft: Legacy"" is a good enough movie. But for us that did watch it, then ""The Craft: Legacy"" is lacking the magic, the foreboding darkness that threatened behind the alluring call of using witch magic. And more importantly, it was lacking memorable characters.The character gallery in ""The Craft: Legacy"" felt like they were using cardboard stand-in, most of them fully devoid of backstory and personalities. Even David Duchovny's character felt like a puppet just brought in for the heck of it.Not even having the likes of David Duchovny and Michelle Monaghan in the movie could do much to lift up what was essentially a hollow and shallow movie experience.The most interesting part about ""The Craft: Legacy"" was the person that showed up in the end of the movie, and get this, was present for a whole staggering 3 second or so! Now, I am not going to say whom it is, but yeah, you guessed it already, because it was that predictable.My rating of ""The Craft: Legacy"" lands on a less than mediocre four out of ten stars. The movie was watchable, for sure, but this was by no means a worthy runner up to the 1996 ""The Craft"".",The Craft - Legacy
5,BandSAboutMovies,An utter and complete waste,3,30 October 2020,"The original version of The Craft is a movie that has never gone away. Written and directed by Andrew Fleming, who also made one of my favorite (and most derivative) slashers, Bad Dreams, and screenwritten by Peter Filardi (Flatliners) with direction from producer Douglas Wick, who wanted to mix the high school experience with witchcraft, the stories that it tells have continued to engage audiences since it came out in 1996.This Blumhouse reimagining/sequel had the opportunity to be interesting. Would it take a whole new pass at the story? Would it refer to anything from the past? Or would it be a muddled mess that tries to have a little of both?This new version has the same problem with so many reimagining: instead of either giving you a new look at an old story or moving past the origin to tell the real story that people want to see (doing so here will necessitate a big spoiler, so I'll explain more at the end of this after plenty of spoiler space), this just tells a new origin and sets up characters without creating a single memorable moment or character that you come back to and want to know more about.The original four girls - Sarah, Bonnie, Nancy and Rochelle - each had their own reasons for turning to witchcraft. They all had their own issues, personalities and even styles. And almost 25 years later, I can still tell you about them and how their individual stories all come together.I just watched this movie last night and I can not tell you a single identifiable thing about the three supporting characters that make up the witches other than two (Frankie and Lourdes) are interchangeable brunettes and Tabby is a black girl who jokes that she doesn't like Beyonce. We learn nothing of their home lives, their challenges and who they want to be in this world, only that they feel ostracized and they feel the need to turn to the left hand path.Lily Schechner is the girl who will be their fourth, completing their coven. She's new in town, as her mom has moved to a new town to live with Adam Harrison (David Duchovny) and his three sons. Maybe I've grown too old, but every boy in this movie felt so interchangeable that I had difficulty figuring out which one was their friend Timmy and which were the three brothers.In fact, why did there even have to be three brothers? None of them are truly essential to the story at all, with the oldest being a cipher at best and a living jump scare at worst. They are interchangeable stock characters that you could remove from this movie and still end up in the same place. Even the villain - spoiler, it's Duchovny) never really seems to gain any steam or even appear to be much of a threat.Zoe Lister-Jones, who wrote and directed this, never really sets up any tension. Again, I must refer to the first movie, where it seemed like without magic, the girls' lives would be meaningless. Nancy, for example, has a life so depressing that you wonder why it took her so long to go completely off the deep end. Her reveal as a sociopath and the girls must working together to stop her tragic unraveling speaks volumes. The moment where the girls realize that getting everything they wanted still leaves them wanting more is as well. Not a single moment happens in this movie that comes within a newt's eye of that.That said, Lister-Jones based much of the film and its characters in her own adolescent experiences as a misgendered youth. She also moved with her mother into a home of all men, so she had to adapt. This is the only part of this film that seems true to me.Now, after adequate spoiler space, I'll tell you the problem.Have you ever seen the Jem and the Holograms movie? It spent so much time telling you the origin story - which took 22 minutes in the original cartoon - that the moment you want to see, Pizzazz and the Misfits vs. Jem and the Holograms, is relegated to a post-credit scene of a perfectly cast Kesha threatening to ruin the happy ending.Here, Lily learns with about ten minutes left in the film that she's adopted. As we get to the end credits, we follow her to a hospital where she gets to meet her birth mother...Nancy Downs (Fairuza Balk). The story of what happened, why Nancy is still in an asylum and how she could have had a daughter, as well as what happens next, is way more interesting than what we just watched.The frustrating thing of Blumhouse - the studio who made a Black Christmas that seemed more like The Skulls and a Halloween that spent inordinate time discussing sandwiches and peanut butter on private parts than having The Shape murder people - is that they will eventually remake every horror movie worth anything. Sure, we'll always have what came before, but for some young folks, their first exposure to something great will be a watered-down modern reimagining that's missing the word imagination.",The Craft - Legacy
6,CinemaSerf,The Craft: Lunacy!,4,29 October 2020,"Yikes, well there's not much point in gilding the lily - this is dreadful. A sort of elongated episode of ""Buffy"", written by someone who has little, if any, grasp of how to construct a suspenseful story and directed with the same level of skill. It reminded me of female equivalent of ""The Covenant"" (2006) and what David Duchovny is doing here is anyone's guess. In my view, it's well out of it's depth getting a cinema release at all - it's a pretty pointless exercise on just about every count that belongs on daytime teen television.",The Craft - Legacy
7,trashgang,more a love story,3,28 December 2020,"Seen the original 1996 flick The Craft a few times back then and in this pandemic again with my youngest daughter of 13, she loved it. And then there was this one.Going blind into it after 20 minutes I started to notice that this was going the wrong way with the love affair happening and to be honest, losing the magic of the coven.It's only in thhe last 20 minutes that it starts to look like The Craft but then the really bad effects came in. They really looked nineties, morphing, really??The score was okay, and in fact using Alanis Morissette in the beginning, I admit i was singing along.Overall, really a bad movie in my opinion. Nothing to do with The Craft just a notice here and there and the last minute.

8,A_Different_Drummer,Way better than the reviews suggest,7,29 October 2020,Forget for a moment that this film is to be a sequel to a 25 year old film that most people have forgotten. Instead consider the energy that the Director injects into the film to compensate for the lack of a traditional story arc ... as a kind of evolution. A new kind of horror. One that engages (thanks to exceptional acting and casting) as much as it horrifies.,The Craft - Legacy
9,ops-52535,tons of potensial but...,7,28 October 2020,"Its not well enough developed the way its plotted into a story of young witches doing witchcraft. the caracter building is like almost zero, how and when each of those young teenage women developed these abilities are never told, its just there as if it was told in another film somewhere and sometime. so to all of us who hasent seen the film this is sequilized from, find it. its a barren plotlife.but its a nice film by all means, great filmography,lots of colour and sound, a big portion of teenagegirl bedroom magic, pentagrams and ouijaboards that will tempt your darling buds of may(-hem) into the dark stuff either they live in witchita or in haggerty. there are cool tricks, lovely young female actresses, and a sort of shapeshifting david duchovny who is spelled to be expelled.one thing is for sure, is that it is a horror/mystery/drama, mashed togeter into a film that almost magically induced races of a full speed and the finito is there all of a sudden, thats usually a good sign thinks the grumpy old man that might feel bewitched at the moment. so dont set your expectations too high, then you will like it.recommended",The Craft - Legacy
10,Reno-Rangan,Just for Cailee Spaeny.,5,4 November 2020,"When I started to watch it, I confused why they called it a sequel. Because the same pattern followed in the beginning as the original. Sometime in the middle, it all changed.The story is not that interesting. The end was all the sudden and below average. The cast, could be the worst in a movie in the recent times, except, Cailee Spaeny. She makes you watch it, otherwise, a movie/ sequel to skip.The end hints, there could be another movie. If they do, I hope they bring new and vibrant cast to make the film more interesting.",The Craft - Legacy
11,cruise01,New Craft with new young girls studying witchcraft lacks story and memorable direction.,4,23 December 2020,2 out of 5 stars.The Craft Legacy is a tedious supernatural horror film that may be a disappointing reboot. About a story of four high school girls practicing witchcraft as they learn and use ther powers for there enjoyment.The new film does lack a story. There is no real story. Besides a new girl moving in with her mothers new boyfriend. She has trouble making friends. While everyone is mean to her. Three girls bring her in to there witchcraft practices.The cast ensemble is forgettable with there roles. Feels like watching a young adult teen series on the cw channel. Making this feel like an hour and a half episode.It is one disappointing film that is worth skipping.,The Craft - Legacy
12,Tweetienator,No Fun to Watch,3,29 October 2020,"A shallow, boring and and unimaginative and therefore unnecessary remake of a solid movie of the 90s. The original from 1996 is okay (not enough horror for my taste but it aimed mostly at an audience still in there teens back then), but The Craft: Legacy is one of those fast produced movies that will fall into oblivion and no one will even remember it was made. The real question here: if you have no vision how to improve a story/movie, why even bother to make a remake!? Anyway, talent seems a scarce resource in the movie business these days. People should work on their skills and craft and not on their hair color, next piercing, or social media accounts or whatever they are using their brainpowers on. If you are interested in watching some girls in their teens making acquaintance with the pleasures and the wrath of using black magic, watch the original one.",The Craft - Legacy
13,pmtelefon,It's the pits,2,9 May 2021,"If the makers of ""The Craft: Legacy"" went for a ""R"" rating instead of a ""PG-13"", they may have made a sexy, dumb movie. But as it is, it's just dumb. The cast is either bland or unappealing or both. The story is silly and uninteresting. ""The Craft: Legacy"" isn't worth the trouble. It's not even good enough for a teenage girl slumber party.",The Craft - Legacy
14,southdavid,Any witch way you can.,5,4 November 2020,"With Lockdown 2: Electric Boogaloo fast approaching in the UK, I wanted to get out for one last cinema trip before they close again. The only new film that fit in time wise was ""The Craft. Legacy"". Maybe it's the good will at being out talking, but whilst it was wholly unremarkable and forgettable, it's not quite as bad as the current 4.1 score makes out.Along with her mother, Helen (Michelle Monaghan), Lily (Caliee Spaeny) travels to a new town, to move in with Helen's new Partner Adam (David Duchovny) a motivational author, and his three sons. Her disastrous first day at the new school sees her become friends with Lourdes (Zoey Luna), Frankie (Gideon Adlon) and Tabby (Lovie Simone), three women and aspirating witches, whose coven has yet to produce any results. Their power is unlocked when Lily becomes their fourth and they soon use their powers for revenge against bullies at the school.I haven't looked at any of the other reviews here yet, but I can only imagine that they're a cesspit of the ""Hollywood with their Pro-trans, anti-men agenda"" type comments. If those ideas are the type of thing you don't like then yes, the film has a trans character and the villain of the story is essentially an embodiment of toxic masculinity. Those things don't really register with me, but there are other flaws that the film has, that I am going to talk about.Mostly, I feel like the principle problem is that the film rushes its story. It could have done with at least one more story point about the girls bonding by using their newfound powers to help themselves, before Lily's misuse of the power leads to them splitting up. Their friendship, fragmentation and reunification would have felt more tangible - had we actually seen them act as friends a little more and not just in a single montage scene. Indeed, the other three girls, particularly Zoey Luna's Lourdes are all sidelined somewhat, in a story that is mostly about Lily. The ending is similarly rushed and lacking in any twist or wit, beyond the one that you'll see coming a mile off.Still, in terms of entertainment it's not as badly made, or performed as that top-level score might have you believing. It just feels more like an elaborate pilot, rather than a full feature and I doubt I'll remember much about when I'm eventually allowed back into a cinema.",The Craft - Legacy

18,Foutainoflife,4.5 Stars,5,30 October 2020,"If you grew up in bv the 90's you've most likely seen 1996's ""The Craft"". Four badass teenage witches, each with their own faultless problems, resentments and hang ups form a coven and begin playing with their abilities with dire results. It was a great film that could've spawned sequels with no problems. After all these years, we finally get a sequel with this film.I've seen a lot of really negative, harsh reviews but I don't think it deserves all the hate. For starters it would've benefited greatly by being titled ""The Craft: Leagacy pt.1"". The ending is left wide open for another film and it just felt incomplete.Here's a few of it's problems. The witches are lacking detail. We don't know much about their backgrounds and they are not the dark witches that were portrayed in the original. These girls are white witches. This fact alone takes away from what was expected. We wanted to see those badass girls again but they just don't make an appearance.The good things are it setting up another film and offering some reassurances in it's final moments. All that was missing has an opportunity to redeem itself with an awesome third film. If it can pull it off with a great script, this will not seem like a flop.As a stand alone movie, it pales in comparison with the original. I still found it to be fairly enjoyable and I'm actually more excited at the idea of a third considering how it has been setup.Most die hard fans are going to be disappointed with the lack of horror but I'm gonna hold out hope for the third and suggest keeping that possibility in mind should you decide to watch it.",The Craft - Legacy

The film has a bunch of characters whose back stories are never explored and the main protagonist is the only redeemable character in this. Everyone else is less than 1 dimensional & the twist in the end tries to inject some life in this poor cauldron of a witch story. The teen drama scenes are laughable & the spells the characters cast leave a bitter resentful taste on the viewer.

It still focuss on a coven and magic, but keeping it spoiler free it does not follow the original beat by beat to make it feel like a soft reboot or such.I am not a fan of Social Justice ill be honest, and there was a fair chunk of it in this movie, wich did annoyed me a bit at time, but under that there was a decent story, good acting, fun to follow up movie.I am not against some form of it, like for instance one of the character is transexual. She does mention it but outside of that, it didn't change the story at all or took space. She's a little taller and bigger than the other girls but thats it, quite frankly if she didn't mentioned it, i wouldn't had known. That kind of stuff does not bother me.I really want to keep this spoiler free totally so i can't say too much but i can say that there seem to have a focus on ""men bad"" troughout the movie and the few male characters that are not jerks actually do not do much.After saying all of this a 7 may seem like a higher score than you would guess, but lets say its more like a 6.7 or 6.8 bumped to a 7, while the original would be a solid 8 for 90s goodness. When i watch a movie and i am fairly entertained troughout and want to see what will happen til the end, it deserve above a 6 for me.",The Craft - Legacy
25,movieman6-413-929510,The second Craft comes across more like a modern remake than a real sequel.,4,28 October 2020,"The Craft: Legacy is the sequel to the 1996 movie The Craft. This sequel is directed, written and produced by Band Aid director Zoe Lister-Jones. She is also more known in the film world as an actress.In the movie, Lily (Cailee Spaeny) and her mother are just new to town, because Lily's mother has met a new man she probably wants to marry. During her first day of school at her new school, Lily comes across as a bit embarrassed and quickly falls victim to the bullies. When Lily manages to befriend three girls who are also seen as the misfits, Lily learns that she has magical powers just like the other three girls. With these powers, they decide to take revenge on the bullies and try to make their school lives a bit easier, but losing control of their magic creates dangers for their and innocent students.With this film, the film studio and crew first tried to make a remake, but later decided to make a sequel of the first film. The decision to make a sequel to the first film, however, is hardly visible until the end of this film. Many things come across as a modern copy of situations that also occurred in the first film. By putting the events of the film in a modern guise, this film comes across as a film from MTV. By putting the situations and problems of the film's characters in a modern light, this can appeal to modern teens more and they can enjoy this film a little more. For the older generation it can also be fun to watch this film with young people, but then the film will appear somewhat copied if you are familiar with the original film.Most special effects look a bit simple, but for the most part they come across as fitting and believable.The acting is done well and appropriately by the cast members in the film. Each character brings up a problem, which teens can also face these days. Most older cast members are less prominent. David Duchovny usually comes out a bit nicer in his other roles, but in this film his character is portrayed in a somewhat annoying way.",The Craft - Legacy
26,themadmovieman,Gratuitously overloaded with social issues and morally problematic,6,28 October 2020,"I really liked The Craft, with its engrossing blend of dark fantasy and strikingly frank coming-of-age drama. Its sequel retains that dark style, boldly going for a borderline R-rated story with some very adult ideas.However, while its predecessor told a challenging story that ultimately showed itself as a moral fable, The Craft: Legacy is a more morally dubious film, gratuitously overloading itself with different social issues of the day and ticking them off one by one as it wrestles with some very problematic themes.First off, though, I really want to praise the way that The Craft: Legacy lives up to the dark reputation of the first film. Though perhaps not as emotionally overwhelming as its predecessor, this sequel really sticks to its guns with a dark and frank story that's more about the characters than pure young adult fantasy.There's a part of me that misses some of the more action-packed fantasy sequences from the previous film, but it's really commendable the way that this sequel commits to a bolder, darker style in a world where it could have been so easy to make a lazy rehash of the Twilight movies.Couple that with strong performances from the film's young lead quartet, all of whom are mature and very assured on screen throughout, and you have a film that's a lot more than just a throwaway bit of fantasy fare.However, I found the way that The Craft: Legacy uses its darker, thematically upfront style really problematic. The Craft told a heavy-going story about bullying and coming-of-age, and although arguably mean-spirited at times, it eventually righted itself with a strong moral message in the end.This film, meanwhile, looks at a variety of wider social issues which are all relevant in the modern world, yet it fails to consider them in enough detail, while also failing to address the morally questionable actions of its main characters.So there are two issues here. First is the way in which The Craft: Legacy seems to tick off mentioning various social issues almost as if it's a 'woke' scorecard, without ever giving them the proper time and attention that they're due. There are throwaway comments about trans issues, racial discrimination, female adolescence, toxic masculinity and more, but the movie does little to really address those issues beyond just including them in the story.All of those themes are important and worthy of discussion, but this film is painfully superficial in dealing with them.Secondly, the film's overarching theme, that of taking on the patriarchy, is somehow used in a really morally questionable way. The film's feminist passions are evident, and it's great to see the way that it lends attention to the feelings of a group of young women, but it spends too much time on the attack, with a bizarre portrayal of men that comes off as incredibly mean-spirited.In this movie, the male characters are either evil masterminds looking to dominate women, or braindead puppets controlled by the whims of women. If the film had addressed either of those portrayals by looking in on itself towards the end, then they wouldn't be such a problem, but it's the way it almost celebrates this erroneous portrayal of men that really doesn't sit right with me.For a film that's clearly there to inspire young women and to tackle important social issues, I was really surprised by just how aggressive and superficial The Craft: Legacy was - a far cry from the engrossing character drama of its predecessor.Overall then, I was disappointed by The Craft: Legacy. Though admirable for its retention of the bold and dark style that made its predecessor so striking, the film struggles in its use of social themes, gratuitously ticking off various issues with little regard for reality, all the while telling a story about taking on the patriarchy in really bizarre fashion.",The Craft - Legacy
27,bangel3322,Massive potential,4,28 November 2020,"This film had a lot of potential, as it some really good ideas running through it. Casting was good, but unfortunately for me this felt unfinished. It was extremely lazy writing...and I'm sorry to Zoe Lister-Jones, but maybe she should stick with acting and not writing. There was no character development, no depth at all. It started off well but it just sailed to end without any structure or form. Then we get a return from a character from the original Craft film l, who was only ends up on screen for 10seconds. What was that? If it's opening it up to the possibility of a sequel, to be honest I'm not interested.",The Craft - Legacy
28,Hallelujah289,Talented young lead actress,5,17 June 2021,"The actress who plays Lily in The Craft: Legacy is a strong actress and it will be nice to watch her career develop. She has a lot of pathos and can embody many fears and anxieties as well as strengths. It's nice the movie centered around her becoming aware of her powers and being introduced to the coven.Beyond though this film plays like an episode of a supernatural tv series rather than its own feature length film. In fact I literally thought that's what it was halfway through and finding out there was no episode 2 or 3 etc. I believe part of the difference between tv episode and film is having an atmosphere, thematic development, character building, and a high degree of layering and symbolism. As well casting characters to tell a story which can be told in the allotted time. It felt like particularly with the teenage boys that there was a lot of room for more development (like the girls having crushes) than actually came to pass and would've suited great in a tv show.This movie unfortunately doesn't bring much to the table and had a lot more talent than what actually made the cut. I think so definitely would've been a better tv show.The ""woke"" culture is kinda cringe.",The Craft - Legacy

36,Golden_Hope,A Bundle Of Loose Ends,3,12 December 2020,"I do really like the original but I never grew up with it so I don't have that connection with it like some other people. That being said this film was still not great.I did actually enjoy some parts especially when the group were kind of just hanging out together and being fun.There are so many dead end plots that just go absolutely no where like just nothing happens. For example there is this random scene where someone sleep walks into the main girls room, it is played as a jump scare. And then we never hear of it again. It was pointless and an absolute waste of time. This is just one thing, there are many other things like this. This is a stab in the dark but when watching I realised a few scenes from the trailer were absent from the movie and I feel like this is maybe why so many sub plots are just dead in the water because they are all on the cutting room floor.I found that the ending seemed tacked on too and was just super unnecessary and then even more so the scenes that take place after the climax of the movie. They once again just felt like ""oh here is an idea...actually never mind"".I think this movie would have been so much better if they just focused on the group and didn't bog it down with everything else. I also didn't like that they were just like had powers from the start there was no build up like in the original and no scenes where they had to practice them.I really liked that it was a pretty inclusive movie and had a inclusive feeling running though the middle of it.One small nit pick as well is that I really didn't like the soundtrack and score. It was such a hodge podge and didn't do the movie any favours. The original movie is such a time capsule of a time and culture in the 90s and this was just like all over the place.",The Craft - Legacy

45,e-m-hobo,"Fun characters at first, followed by sloppy superficialities",5,6 September 2021,"The editing at times is also sloppy and uninspired. One of the most annoying bits of it being the lack of match cuts when necessary, the image jumping a bit with the windows from day to night. When the main character, a witch girl discovering her powers, goes through a whole bunch of emotions, cutting between facial expressions / responses, the timing also feels mundane and removes all tension.One of the mainstay wrongs in terms of Hollywood-rules taught that you can see ruin this movie, is the pressure to be non-specific in your dialogue. People teaching you that you're not really allowed to say anything in dialogue fail to see that dialogue that isn't ""functional"" or ""too on the nose"" is still specific. Throughout the entire movie what happens as such gets stuck on superficialities, leading to illogical jumps where we just have to assume that what they decide is logically intertwined.The movie also feels formulaic in that conflict is introduced without just cause, without a good setup, so it isn't clear at all why the other girls get angry and cast the binding spell.Also, at first being the ones seeking a fourth member and then being like, ""Nope. We're just going to quit magic,"" is too much of a turnaround without a proper reason, because the death of one character doesn't immediately lay the blame with others. ""Yeah, so, didn't we teach you responsibility?"" Nope, they didn't, they were being irresponsible and the main character was trying to do the responsible thing. Turning that around all of a sudden doesn't make any sense.The ending actually was anti-climactic. I've heard people say it before, but here, really it was. Just stand there, don't move, don't fight! Whatever you do, you're the aggressor, so be passive! It's political magic!If they would have fleshed the movie out properly, it would have been closer to two hours and the dialogue wouldn't be as superficial. And really, she has to overcome her fears and jump down from one or two floors up and we don't get to see her jump or them do some kind of flying spell or whatever? Really? Now she's in the house and now they are outside walking away? Really.I watched it, but if this had been the first and the first the second, I wouldn't have watched what now actually is the original The Craft.

47,Milo-Jeeder,"Subpar sequel to a classic, but not nearly as bad as people make it out to be.",5,14 November 2020,"I get it, the movie errs on the side of being too preachy and ""woke"", which is something that was likely to get a lot of criticism, especially considering that this flick was bound to attract a lot of attention from fans of the first movie (mostly people in their thirties, like myself). Drawing a comparison is somewhat inevitable, given that ""The Craft"" (1996) is widely regarded as a cult flick, but, as a standalone movie, ""Legacy"" works in its own way and, while I can understand why so many people were dissatisfied with it, I would say that it doesn't deserve all these 1/10 scores that it got on IMDb or other websites. This sequel is mostly aimed at a younger audience with a more social justice warrior mindset, for the lack of a more fitting description. While I pretty much tend to roll my eyes at any kind of preachiness, I didn't find it impossible to sit through this flick, like I experienced with other ""woke"" movies.While in the original film we get a group of girls who were mostly miserable and dark, because of their inner conflicts and the fact that they were mostly ostracized by their peers, ""Legacy"" gives us four girls who are pretty much sparkly and happy. Actually, I would say that, at some point, I found them annoyingly loud and enthusiastic, especially about their magic, which they mostly use to play silly tricks and whatnot.
While the 1996 film dwells into the lives of each of the four girls, allowing us to know them and empathize with them, ""Legacy"" mostly focuses on Lily, the main character. As a matter of fact, the other girls' lives are never even explored, which is something that bothered me a lot, because it felt alienating and rushed. Who are ""the three others""? Lourdes, a transgender latina; Tabby, who we never really get to know and Frankie, a ditzy and likeable girl who, at some point, receives a snarky comment from a popular girl, who makes fun of her for being allegedly unattractive.
I think one of the biggest problems with ""Legacy"" is, precisely, that we don't really get to know who these girls are, while the original was a character-driven type of film. Seriously, these four girls are mostly likeable, they don't harm anyone and they just enjoy their powers, but we don't really get to know them and many of their personality treats seem to have a cookie cutter approach. These four girls aren't particularly memorable. So, they're woke social justice warriors... big deal. Don't we get enough of these types of characters these days? Apparently, not. These girls just don't stand out in any way.In ""The Craft: Legacy"" the main antagonist is none other than... patriarchy itself (surprise!). David Duchovny basically plays a lazily written character that could be described as ""the very, very bad man that thinks women are weak and they need to submit to the greatness of the male"". Seriously, how stereotypical and predictable is that? So, while in the original film, the girls have a falling out and are pit against each other, in this sequel, they also have a falling out, but eventually team up to fight a greater evil: men. But, to be fair, not all men in this movie are absolute trash... only 93.5% of them are. In spite of this, ""The Craft: Legacy"" is not really an anti-men statement, but more like a half-assed essay on the negative effects of male chauvinism. In doing so, the movie offers a bunch of contrived situations and artificial characters, like the school bully turned into a social justice warrior, after the girls put a spell on him. Though, clearly, they are the good ones, the girls are not portrayed as absolute angels who can do no wrong, either. As a matter of fact, at some point, they acknowledge that they have abused their powers and force themselves to quit magic altogether, which was refreshing.""The Craft: Legacy"" is definitely not a masterpiece and it will never gain cult status, like the original film, but it's not the unwatchable mess that people make it out to be. It should be mentioned that, while the 1996 flick had a few horror moments, ""Legacy"" doesn't even bother going there, and it ends up being more, like, a teen drama with a few sparkly stars here and there and a shape-shifting antagonist.",The Craft - Legacy
48,cristinalinderman,A bland-messy film.,2,29 October 2020,"* There is no end credit scene *The director Zoe Lister-Jones and crew brought a bland-messy film. The first film The Craft (1996) had its flaws but it was still a good film and this sequel could never be on the same level. I wasn't excited about this movie because the trailer didn't catch my interest but I was hoping to be at least a good watch and it wasn't, not even a little bit. There was no character development and the plot was all over the place, everything was happening very superficially. The magic looked so cheesy like watching a Disney movie about witches and there isn't anything wrong with that but this type of movie wasn't supposed to go in that direction. I did like the turn of events of the witches using magic for fun and for good, it was a different take on it from the previous one.The antagonist could have been better handled, the character might have probably saved the movie but since there was no character development it all kept falling flat, such a shame it was a great missed opportunity. If only they showed more background on the antagonist this story could have a sense of horror or a more serious tone, but if they thought of not doing it just to leave the character as a surprise well they were wrong because it was obvious from the very beginning. The ending twist was predictable from the moment they revealed the secret that was kept from her and it was so clear who it was going to be. This movie is rated PG-13 but I felt like it was rated PG.The composer Heather Christian brought beautiful music and it sets a magical atmosphere. Her music was great, but sometimes it felt too much or didn't quite sync and I blame the film. This music could have been better enjoyed with a more solid script.There was nothing wrong with the cast but it was hard to appreciate their performance when there was no build up in the characters and nothing to grasp with but there was one exception. I did like the performance of the mother of the lead witch, Michelle Monaghan. I like the way she bonded with her daughter though it didn't last long because it was another thing that disappeared while the story was rushed to the end.",The Craft - Legacy

Three brothers who are very intriguing and whose characters ultimately go nowhere.

66,df4205,No magic and no heart,3,1 November 2020,"A hot mess of a film that doesn't know if it wants to be a sequel or a remake. Oh, where to begin? Firstly--weren't there supposed to be four girls? Like the Rocky Horror before it, one of the main reasons the original worked was the characters. The original became a cult (no joke intended) classic because it spoke to the often maligned groups of young girls/women that weren't often portrayed in film.Whether you identified with Nancy as the poor trash girl who is surrounded by the affluent who looked down on you, or it was Bonnie and her scars that reminded you of that physical defect that made you unpopular: There was a character to relate to. Here--there is none of that. From the first moment we see the girls on screen, we're struck with just how ""normal"" they are. My first thought was: ""I think you've forgotten your target audience here."" The original spent a good deal of time making us identify with and understand why each girl was a reject from 'normal' society. Here, they're all pretty and seem of reasonable means when compared to their peers. Heck, the one girl lives in a house that you can literally run down its halls!So, our MAIN character (I put that in caps because she is literally the only character we get to know) and her mother are moving in with mom's boyfriend and My Three Sons. Well, evidently nobody bought this girl the book ""Are You There God? It's Me, Margaret"" because she has an unfortunate accident in school. Then Carrie uses her supernatural telekinetic powers to take revenge on all those who laughed at her! What? That's a different movie? Oh. Well, you can understand my confusion. Anyway, she meets the other girls and...you're a wizard, Harry. She of course takes this news with little muss and fuss and is soon casting spells. Naturally they teach her THE CRAFT by instructing her how they ALWAYS form a circle of salt when they cast spells...and by ALWAYS--we mean just this one time and then it is never spoken of again. There's an odd moment of ""What's your lineage? You have to get it from somewhere."" Um, what? Wasn't Sarah's whole deal in the original was that she was a 'Natural Witch'? (Yes, I know she got it from her mother, but it does imply that witches can be born with the power.) Given the ending (that was completely ruined by the trailer) this lineage thing leads to some serious questions. (SPOILER ALERT!) Nancy didn't have any magical lineage that I'm aware of--so no--not sure what your talking about. Well, anyway, they stop time, move things with their minds, and levitate...this sounds like something Spelling would write...oh wait.Anyway, the movie takes a serious left turn into Soap Opera land when the girls cast a spell on a mean guy to make him a nice guy. Umm...sweetie...I don't think you read that spell book. I'm pretty sure any practicing witch would tell you your instruments to be cleansed (and possibly sacred)...I'm not sure a bong counts. Well, now he's just one of the gals! There's an endless and agonizing scene where he confesses that he has bisexual leanings. Being an outcast herself--no wait--no she isn't--whatever. Our heroine decides to screw with his already confused sexuality by casting a love spell on him....our hero ladies and gentlemen! Am I missing something here? Look, I'm all for you playing to the LGBT crowd that love and support the original...but wasn't that the point of including a Trans character? You remember? The one you made such a big fuss about including? Shouldn't you...I don't know...give her some focus! Well, look--we're right back to forgetting our other three girls exist.Now we hit the point that really veers away from the original's message. The original had the very strong message about power corrupting. We understood why each girl let the power go to their head...but it was still a big part of the plot. Now--the other three almost immediately realize they've abused their power and take steps to limit themselves. There is one vague moment where you think there might be some repercussions happening...but it turns out the brother sleepwalks. Huh? Wow. That was the worst fake-out I've seen in a long while. I'm glad it was never mentioned before and then never spoken of again. Well, this time around the message is girls are good and down with the sexist male regime! Yes, only men can be corrupt evil pig-swine who want nothing more than to take a woman's power away. Yes, it turns out the stepdad is an evil manwhich (thank you Xander from Buffy). Of course, for those of us that remember our Thundercats, this moment was spoiled at seeing his family crest. Well, girl power to the rescue!Well, its finally over...and none of us have to go to jail for murder. Too bad about my bisexual friend though...oh well. Too bad about my stepdad's sons too. I mean, they didn't really do anything...oh well. Time to go find my birth mother...yes, I was adopted. (Spoiler Alert again!) Well, turns out its Nancy....dun dun dun! How? Good question. The movie takes great pains to avoid answering who my father is. Now we all know it couldn't have been Chris; considering he and Nancy broke up months before the first movie started...and she didn't seem pregnant. Has she been in the asylum this whole time? Was the janitor my father? So--how does this make any sense?A manwhich did it.Final Thoughts: Who are these people? That seems to be the massive lumbering dinosaur in the room. We spend WAY too much time with the Main girl; to the complete detriment of the others. I don't know them and therefore can't identify with them. There is absolutely no characterization or development here to make you care one whit about any of the other three girls. Which maligned group are these girls supposed to represent? Part of the charm of the original characters was that they appealed to several underrepresented social groups. Here--they all sound like Valley girls that just want to 'dish' about boys at the mall. And look--I'm really not trying to downplay the bisexual guy's story. I really appreciated the comment about how everyone just assumes he's ""GAY"" because he happens to like both. It's just too bad there wasn't some other character on the sexuality rainbow that could have made us feel for her struggle with non-conformity and gender identity. Someone in the Pans or Trans spectrum perhaps. Oh...if only that character had existed and had received more than two throwaway lines about her difficulties.",The Craft - Legacy

Full disclosure, I was totally with the movie for the first 15 minutes, and then, I don't know what happened.. she caught her step bro and then the movie just turned into scenes with no story.
I feel like the tension was leading one way and the ""story"" was just like ""Look over there!"" There was NO character development. None. The three other witches were just there for what? For a fantastical Peter Pan discovering magic scene - full on with Tinkerbell's fairy dust.I do feel like up until Timmy's confession it could've been pretty good, it really felt like it was going somewhere, but then, detour.Also, people calling the final battle CW/Charmed-esque, aren't over exaggerating.2/10 for the first 15 minutes.",The Craft - Legacy

There was literally zero character build-up and whilst the acting was good, the storyline was pretty basic overall. I would've liked a darker tone with another nutter (Nancy style) who takes stuff too far and walks on water so I was kinda disappointed with this high school TV movie offering.

The story line that should have been filled. A lot of confusing spots that you had to figure out how things were playing out. Sad because the actors and actresses did very well and deserved a better story line. I will watch the film again to see if I can find a better storyline that I missed the first time around. As a Witch myself, I am saddened to see certain things in the film that do not truly happen however very happy to see that the girls bound themselves when they realised that they were using manipulative magic. That is a very big no no among Witches. True witches know that using manipulative magic is against the rules I know it was nice to see how the film really showed that side of witchcraft.I'm going to give this film a second watch and perhaps I will see something new that I didn't see the first time around at least I hope that how this plays out.

The original movie, with a back story for each girl, made you root for them. This one decided character development didn't matter.It had its interesting moments and threw in a twist, but once the twist happened, they had a horrible score behind it that detracted from the scene so much, I thought, ""Ugh, who decided on this crappy music?""What a shame.

Instead we got 1 dimensional characters, friendship montages, and no suspense.The four girls could have been really interesting, but the film spent zero time giving us any back story whatsoever on any of the girls. The spell making Timmy woke was pretty funny, but the scene where he realizes he's been played and how that effects him and the characters never happens.What Is David Duchovny's back story? How did he know Lily was a witch? How did Fairuza Balk have a kid if she's been in an institution all these years? The whole patriarchy as the enemy thing could have been so cool but instead, like every other part of this film we get a shallow cliché riddled twitter speech before our witches come out on top without experiencing any real sense of danger.And what about those three sons? What were their backstories? Where were their personalities? What happened to them in the end?The dialogue was pretty painful to watch for most of the film, and it was all so tame. Nice and tame.

This is in the craft universe, but it's not really a sequel. Seemingly just another set of girls in a coven, a new story. I really enjoyed the young cast, the lead actress especially. I don't think this film was trying to be like the original... it's its own thing. bottom line: It's entertainment. It's not a masterpiece. It's not iconic. It's not supposed to be, but it did keep my attention. And, might I add... It's so funny how people get so offended by men exploring their sexuality, or people figuring out their gender identity. I thought the male aspects especially added an interesting little twist, and I liked the end twists too. If witches exist, warlocks do too, right?

Also Fairuza's cameo was weak and completely unnecessary to the plot, they'd could have given her something to do. Also the stepfather storyline was cheesy and all of his sons look like GQ models so it was implausible and goofy. The one cast member who stood out was Gideon Adlon and I think she has a huge career ahead of her as she was a major scene stealer. Also the seance and possession scenes reminded me a lot of that movie The Axe Murder of Villisca, it was like the same vibe. It also wasn't scary or thrilling and I felt like they couldn't decide if they wanted to make a thriller or a coming of age story, it was like the Perks of Being a Wallflower meets Howard the Duck.",The Craft - Legacy
84,Yourmothersbox,Rough,2,16 June 2021,"Getting it over with now, I was perfectly fine with how they handled some of the character's traits such as a transgender. At the core, the original was about bullying gone bad. So when they changed one character to a trans character I thought, oh okay I can see where the transphobia is really going to play well in the bullying theme...but nothing. It ending up coming out crass and cringey. Why? Because it felt like the filmmakers WANTED to make a statement about transphobia, which works well within the original story set up, but then they got scared of offending anybody and kind of just ignored it. A perfect example of people trying to look ""woke"" but showing that they're just using it to reach a demographic, and that sucks. They had a real opportunity to shine some light on the harsh world of bullying but every character was handled with silk gloves. They couldn't commit to the movements they were stealing from for commercial gain. Instead we get one or two random name calling moments, then bam, is craft time! Boooooo.",The Craft - Legacy

This sequel tries to follow the same basic story beats while updating it and doing its own thing with it, but it doesn't always turn out the way the filmmakers had anticipated.Lily, a new girl at school, has her period during her first day at school and is befriended by 3 quirky classmates who discover she might be the fourth witch to complete their coven. They become close, trying out spells, and using their witchcraft to serve people just desserts, but will their powers soon take over their lives?Any problems the film has are no fault of the 4 lead actresses who create a believable sense of community and sisterhood throughout and it's nice to see a film where women aren't at each other's throats and support one another. I only wish some of them had been better developed, because it seems to me like the filmmakers were more interested in them than the horror portions which come in far too infrequently and don't pack any kind of punch whatsoever. It makes one wonder what would happen if they threw out the horror elements altogether and made it a story of female friendship instead.About midway through, it becomes clear that The Craft: Legacy has done a poor job of raising the stakes for these characters and we stop caring what the outcome will be which is what really drives the stake through the film's heart.",The Craft - Legacy

And That is a GOOD thing since Remakes are over used these days (A new REBOOTED Battlestar Galactica tv series plus an unrelated Battlestar Galactica movie are currently in the works simultaneously just to Prove this point). Sequels rarely are as good as the original and this movie was no exception. However, it was a solid and logical (if not overly creative) follow up to the events in The Craft with call backs but Not outright repetition of the original p!ot. It could have been a little darker.

Soon, they're casting spells to make school bullies nicer and more woke, but it's not long before they backfire and they have to try to deal with the consequences.A soft reboot/sequel to a beloved cult film that's over 20 years old is a task I wouldn't wish on my worst enemy, but The Craft: Legacy gets some things very right and some things horribly wrong. The main foursome of girls are a likable group and I hope they all go on to have wonderful careers, because even when there's not much to work with on the page, they manage to overcome it due to charisma alone.Unfortunately, the script doesn't allow for much conflict and it hardly ever feels like a horror movie and more just a series of scenes strung along with very little supporting them.

This movie was enjoyable, did take a while for it to get going. The story was all right and the acting was good . However David Duchovny is a horrible actor in this movie and I don't know why he was cast. I also did not like the fact that they gave Fairuza baulk a three second cameo at the very end of the movie.

I can forgive the quick beginning, but the middle was just overly rushed with no small conflicts or anything to push the depth of the story, and the ending climax was about as suspenseful as blinking your eyes.However, the lead character was great, the general cast was good, it was somewhat entertaining to watch, I just wanted more, and the fact that I can say that I wanted more means they did something right.

She's immediately branded on outcast by everyone in her class except for three girls who practice witchcraft. Before long, she's joined their coven because she's a natural and they're casting spells on their fellow classmates to make them better people.For something branded as a horror film, there's not really any horror at all.

It was like a really bad after school special - like a bad Disney movie. - I've seen better low budget movies that did more and made more sense.
The special effects / powers etc,,, were just a joke.
It would have had a better chance selling itself without trying to connect to the original movie.
Everything was super over acted, and they went wayyyy overboard with all the slow-motion scenes. If you removed all the slow motion parts, the movie would be probably 30 min shorter.
Also., it was over edited- you saw most of the movie in the trailers, and some of what you saw in the trailer was removed from the movie.
There was one small twist, and if they incorporated that earlier in the movie and made it more of the plot, the movie may have had a small chance.

As every single one I read is stating opinions like they're facts. No real critics here. Just pure arrogance.Honestly, if I watched a film and thought it was that bad, I wouldn't be wasting even more of my time reviewing it. Unfortunately in this day and age, we have a lot of wannabe critics and people who simply like to hate on everything. This is why I believe IMDb would be much better off doing away with the user reviews. People shouldn't be told what to think by someone else. They should decide for themselves whether or not something is good or bad.In my opinion, the movie wasn't great but it was no where near as bad as what a lot of user reviews are saying. I mean some of them are saying they couldn't follow the story and I'm sorry but unless they are incredibly thick, I don't know how it's hard to follow. I'd love to see these people watch something like inception, fight club or hell even back to the future, if they find this film confusing.It is what it is. A harmless film about teenage witches. It was never gonna be great. It was never gonna win any awards. It's just easy watching. Something to put on if you're bored and running out of things to watch.I don't usually write reviews. As I say I don't like to waste my time but when I seen how bad some people were slamming it and talking they're king d**k when it comes to what's good and what's not.

I actually thought it was okay but could have been so much better if they got rid of the other three witches and just had Lily discovering her powers and battling the new demonic stepfather.One of the big problems is that there is NO chemistry between the 4 witches and they each seem to be acting in different movies, with varying degrees of success. Physically and emotionally, they don't seem to convince as a group. I have to say that apart from Lilly, the three other witches have been given no backstories and excessive amounts of sassy dialogue which doesn't give us any insight into their lives at allDavid Duchovny must just need money for renovations to be involved in something like this and the suicide theme is awkwardly handled with the girls not accepting that they actually played a role in what happened.

In fact, it is worse in almost every way.How in the hell did they get David Duchovny and Michelle Monaghan to do this? It would be an easy pay day for them but I'm sure the pay wasn't much and to hurt you name doing crap like this....sheesh.Anyways, as others here have said, this movie is rushed and doesn't make sense in many spots.

113,jaeelbooks,"Few Good Points, Many Bad Ones",3,29 November 2020,"'The Craft: Legacy' was a rather mediocre addition into what is sure to become 'The Craft' franchise. When I heard Fairuza Balk was making an appearance in it, I became eager to see it. When I then saw that her screen time was cut to less than a minute, I was ultimately disappointed. Putting her very brief appearance aside, 'The Craft: Legacy' seems more like a toned-down reboot than an actual sequel to the stunning original film. 'The Craft' - original - was exciting, dark, creepy, had a killer soundtrack, and a solid plot. It was not short on the scares. 'The Craft: Legacy' has a killer soundtrack, a bland and disappointing plot, too many 'look, we're having so much fun and isn't it pretty' bright parts, and zero scary moments or true homage to forms of witchcraft that could even be relatively possible. Of the cast, transgender actress Zoey Luna gave the only real stand-out performance, and there was a decent attempt by Lovie Simone, given the unimpressive dialogue she was tasked to work with. Cailee Spaeny's 'Lily' seems too much like a Robin Tunney wannabe but without the edge and bravery. Of the cast's four main witches, Lily might have the strongest powers, but she's the weakest in all other aspects. David Duchovny appears as the wicked stepfather-to-be, and seems to run some kind of macho, male-empowerment cult that we learn far too little about to care. Michelle Monaghan does a decent job as Helen, Lily's 'mother,' given that her character is also rather weak and very undefined. Aside from Fairuza's split-second appearance, the film manages to pay homage to a few traits of the first movie - the calling of the elements and directions, the appearance of snakes (although briefly and not fully utilized), and the fact that the girls pair up while in school. What the film truly lacked, aside from it's way too politically correct script, was scares. I found it to be Blumhouse's most disappointing film in recent years. For a company that set a new foundation for horror in their earlier years, they fell way short with 'The Craft: Legacy.' They had an opportunity to make this film something truly great for this new generation, and they failed. Kudos to Nicholas Galitzine, who plays Timmy, for somehow managing to pull off a somewhat emotionally split and unbalanced role with a script that would have had me gouging my eyes out and praying to be recast, had I been him. Two rather fine actors Charles Vandervaart and Donald MacLean Jr. are so incredibly underused in this film that it makes their characters barely worth mentioning. If Blumhouse were to decide to make another movie in this franchise, they need to sit down, review the first one again, see where they went wrong, and give us something new and different. Otherwise, they needn't bother. If you haven't yet seen 'The Craft: Legacy,' it is available for $20 on pay-per-view and streaming services. Save your money. Wait until it's free one day. Then, you won't be cursing yourself as I was after blowing the money on it.",The Craft - Legacy

And yes, this was dripping with wokeness. I also didn't think David Duchovny should have played the love interest of Lily's mom. He's looking a little long in the tooth for that part these days.

120,eggrolljr,Zero character development,3,30 October 2020,"What a misfire this movie was. The plot made zero sense, the new characters were entirely without nuance or development, and the visual effects looked like a bad Instagram filter.It felt like the writer was so concerned with making the central cast come across as perfectly moralistic do-gooders, that they forgot they where writing teenagers. When a male (Timmy) is the most interesting and fleshed out character in a Craft sequel, you've done something horribly wrong.You'll see quite a few moments in the trailer that never showed up in the actual film, which leads me to think that the heavy hand of an editor was involved in this one. I knew this movie was seriously in trouble when the central conflict wasn't even introduced until the last twenty minutes.This feels like the Nickelodeon version of The Craft, with all of the original film's edges systematically filed down to smooth nubs that won't injure anyone if they accidentally bump up against it.",The Craft - Legacy

Who or what was that Adam guy? He has a family crest with a snake and a knife.. cool.. and that's about it, all you get to know about this guy.. oh and he has 3 sons that are like just there.. adding zero to the movie (that scene where one of them is apparently sleep walking in Lily's room.. ???)

The cast was believable, like able and what not but I would have enjoyed more bulk to the story. More character development. It like seemed too ""normal"" that these girls were just witches lol.

The main character played by Cailee, had tremendous potential to live up to the original but whether the story ended up on the cutting room floor or was never written, I don't know. i was really looking forward to this but unfortunately, all-in-all,I'm disappointed.

138,vowhite,Gen Z Cheesy and just not worth it,4,28 March 2021,"I've never made a review until now...
I'm a HUGE fan of the first since it came out when I was a younger kid. Still remains one of the best movies from my childhood.So while I had small expectations from the trailer but I still had an open mind going into it.The cons definitely outweigh the pros.Cons: There was ALOT of unanswered questions, lots of things were thrown at your randomly, the scenes were rushed, the effects were boring/very cheesy af, and the majority of the actors mostly the girls and parents were very cringy. And the way the humor and comedic relief was thrown in just wasn't it. And It just felt so underwhelming. And it is def built around a Gen Z audience instead of the older audience who loved the original and made it a cult classic
Pros: it had some potential, the main actress who played Lily was ok. The actor who played Tommy was better and the best of the cast. Probably because of the actual and only character development and was very well played. Not to sound harsh but that's about it.In the end this whole plotline seems like something a high school teenager would've wrote for a English creative writing story.Very disappointed but not surprised.",The Craft - Legacy

However, I will say that if you grew up watching the original film, odds are you won't care for this one.This version is very generationally focused, they hit every mark when it comes to inclusion, there's a bunch of weird magic effects, the plot was very all over the place - it just didn't sit right with me.In closing, I do want to mention again that the lead actress was great!

144,spock-billy-spike,None of The Roughness that Made the First so Original/Entertaining/Worth Watching,2,1 November 2020,"Not a bad movie in its own right but it for sure isn't at all related to the Craft. It's an ok coming of age story but it's just 120% too much at times. Everything lines up perfectly so that the characters can have sassy lines and the story progresses at the right pace. I love what they're going for but then once you get a sense of the script then you can predict the character choices all throughout the film. Also... let's talk about how it's all about being woke and consent (which is great) but the Lily clearly puts a LOVE SPELL on a boy. Which, I don't know about you but looks like something akin to drugging someone. Lily takes advantage of that boy, he is not making his own choices and that is sexual assault. It's not okay because he's a boy and maybe he liked her before and whatever excuse you have... he didn't kiss her until she put a spell on him. A rough comparison but Lily is basically the bad guy in Jessica Jones. Just boil it down to: human manipulates/drugs other human so they can use them as a sexual puppet. One line by one of the characters about it not being consensual (after earlier in the movie they talk about consent in the school like the screenwriter wants to make it clear that it's not being taken seriously in society) does not equal this movie taking it seriously.Cliche, totally hypocritical, moments that would be individually cool do not make up for the other 99.9%.Just.... don't even try it",The Craft - Legacy
145,curtismenne,I'm glad I didn't trust the reviews. A solid modern sequel.,8,30 October 2020,"So I am going to go out on a limb and say that clearly a lot of the negative reviews are I am sure from people who didn't like the movie but were definitely not the target audience.I will do my best to avoid any spoilers.Let me preface this review with the statement that I did enjoy the film and like it a great deal. Kudos to all those that were involved in the project on doing your best to capture the magick that made the first film great. :)The movie was well made, well acted, and captured the spirit of the original while making it fresh with a modern perspective. Also it was nice to see Wiccans shown in a more realistic light as in that it's about positivity and not about Satan or hurting people. Witchcraft has nothing to do with the devil people, that is Christianity! There is no devil in our religion. The one thing I do not like is that it felt heavy handed with women good, men bad. A film representing Paganism of all things should be about balance and equality so the sexism is pretty misguided. I mean where in the $@&* was the male witch representation in this film? For trying to be modern and diverse they should have had a male witch somewhere in the film or at least referenced. I am sorry but being male and Pagan who grew up in the 90's when the original came out I understood that male witches were too tough a concept for people to grasp back then but it's 2020 so don't make Paganism into some sexist gender war. The movie felt like it's messaging was that if you were male you had to be LGBTQ to not be evil and that kind of sucks. It's bad enough that Witchcraft gets demonized and mocked by those who don't understand it but to have The Craft sequel in 2020 still give us no love well that is just a damn shame.

The original was dark and broody. This is bubblegum ""horror"" at its worst.The story is similar to the original movie with every bit of atmosphere and controversy sucked out of it.

It definitely was rushed and dident have the magic and spells that I'm sure most people were expecting . The ending was horrible and did not satisfy my dark obsession at all. I feel they had plenty of time to do something better as the original came out in the 2000's. This movie also ended abruptly and left me unfulfilled . The 3 witches could have been decendents of the original in some way and it should have continued off the original . Just poorly done and I was really looking forward to this . Just a horrible movie with a lack of Imagination , it dident draw me in like the original and left me asking myself why did I waste my time or get so excited on something that failed so utterly miserable . Especially since blumhouse was a contributor to the film I expected better . It does not deserve 5 stars somewhere in the negative stars I would say.

155,vampchic2,Fairuza returned for this?!,1,9 November 2020,"This movie was pathetic. The original movie is one of my favorites and I was looking forward to this sequel, especially when I found out that Fairuza Balk would be returning for it. Figured that was a sign of something good, but that was a mistake. This movie didn't make any sense and the acting was ridiculous. None of the three witch friends made a lasting impression, aside from their overreaction to the main girl kissing that boy. Their upset over that was absurd and then the binding spell wasn't even the same one used in the original movie. Pathetic. The villain was predictable, I guessed it when we first met him, and he was just ridiculous too. It makes sense that this film would be silly because it's only rated PG-13 whereas the original was rated R, but I truly can't understand what even inspired anyone to make this sequel at all. The plot was nowhere to be found. In truth the only redeeming quality was the beginning where the main girl and her mom were singing along to Alanis Morissette and when the mom messed up the lyrics they had a nice laugh. Sweet moment and my only positive takeaway. When we FINALLY see Fairuza she got to say ONE LINE! This is one of the craziest witches ever and she's all chill with her one line as if her ending in the original never happened. And given her end in the original film where she was strapped to a bed in an asylum, I'm very curious how she is involved in this movie the way she is. I mean HOW??! She's still locked up and yet they just let this girl walk right into her room?! Alone?! Makes zero sense. Clearly they hoped to make a third film with the abrupt ending here, but that will never happen. It was absolutely terrible. So much so that Amazon actually refunded our $20 rental of it. At least there was that silver lining. Can't yet the 1.5 hours back unfortunately. If you're a fan of the first movie, rewatch that instead and leave this one resting in peace.",The Craft - Legacy

Why does the witch guy wanted to get lily's powers? And who killed Timmy? Why kill Timmy? Is the sons also a warlock? What happened to them after they burned the witch guy? I mean c'mon Blumhouse..

So I hate to make this comparison. But the first half was like Season 1 Charmed, gritty and dark... and the second half was like Season 5 charmed where it got all fairytale and leprechauns. I think in comparison to the original Craft movie it lacks the darkness and the horror movie feel. There was nothing creepy about this except for one fairly creepy scene .It definitely started out strong but by the 3/4 turned into a weird extended episode of some teenage witch power ranger type show and I lost hope. Some of the effects were all too 'sparkly' and 'Sabrina the teenage witch' for me.

172,Drax17,Hyped up shimmer dusted fluff,3,29 October 2020,"STICK TO THE ORIGINAL !!!
I had to edited this review, its the day after & Im still thinking of this movie..... for all the wrong reasons......
This makes no sense right from the start. It starts with Lily driving along with her mum, they put a song on & Lily starts crying...... we never find out WHY !!! All it does it sets it up they she may just be an over emotional teenager who cries at anything. I also don't understand what was the point of the youngest son... ok he was nice to Lily but those scenes / conversations could have been with ANYONE !! In the original you see the girls daily struggles, from bullying, being outcast, rumours, lack of self confidence etc.... this made you feel & root for them. But in this take theres nothing like this, no struggles at all to be on their side.... the closest is when Tabby mentions she's wanting to protect her brother. and no one sits with them at lunch, even transgender character Lourdes was under-utilised for portraying struggles, the only thing mention by her is she doesn't get a period.... are you kidding me !!! What a waste for not giving her more of a platform........You never see any real struggles, its just portrayed they're just wanting 'super powers'. The only good thing to come out of this is it gave the young cast a job, but clearly the older cast were hard up for a pay cheque to agree to star in dribble. This is just a bunch of embarrassing fluff. There are hints of misogyny throughout.... I kept waiting for this to build to something bigger.... granted no amount of misogyny is acceptable but it seemed like this would become a bigger thing (again another thing lacking). When it came to the final confrontation honestly they could have just used a cardboard cut out for all the thrill & action the 'big bad' gave. They only intimidating thing was their eyes went black.....and even that was just eye roll worthy....Not sure whether thats due to lack of a strong story or whether has been watered downed by the studio to make it appeal to a wider audience, but has caused major harm.
If your a fan of the original AVOID THIS AT ALL COSTS!! If you must see, wait till its available for free then cleanse your palette with the original. This is only going to appeal to a younger audience who haven't seen the awesome original.
I was skeptical when the rumours of a remake started, that was then heightened when the trailer dropped.... The story was all over the place & just seemed like a lot of fluff that hadn't been fleshed out enough to make a good story with a good confrontation. Just a bunch of glitter dusted misogyny (that wasn't developed enough to be the big bad). Even when the girls decided to take a break made no sense... Im still shaking my head trying to make sense of what I just watched & why the hell there was so much glitter eyeshadow....... Very poor attempt at a reboot, more time should have been given to get it right.",The Craft - Legacy
173,iansputnik,Promising but flawed,5,26 August 2021,"This wasn't a bad watch, but (and I mean lots of buts). Three of the four girls had no direct links to witchcraft BUT seemed to obtain them when the gifted one arrived without any personal talent of their own apart from owning modern books. Really, you can learn to be a witch from a purchase from Amazon?The film teased at the idea that the bad man's sons were under his control but didn't like it, but no payout of this potential storyline. It would have really improved the storyline if they aligned with the girls in the end to defeat him.Mr bad man- why? We never got any real explanation of his goals.No repercussions for the death of demon dad. No mention of his orphaned sons. He was burnt to death, what, no police involvement?Awfully annoying overacting by the other three girls. Zany whooping and dancing around and shouting in school corridors isn't interesting, it's just plain embarrassing. Also, thought she was meant to be in detention and went to the toilet. Didn't the teacher notice that she didn't return?These are just a few of the things I found irksome, there are more.A shame as it wasn't unwatchable. Didn't the producers of this try screening it for feedback before releasing it????It's almost like it was a series that was cut to bits to make it into a film and by doing so subplots we're lost or discarded on the cutting room floor.So promising, not well executed.

I'm a practicing witch and this one actually had more real magickal elements than the original had. The original was basically for 16 year olds and it made us all wanna be witches, that's what this one is for 16 year olds of today. I loved the girls, the makeup, and the performances. And it had more levels to the story than I would've imagined.

There are only a few things that I missed:
Character development, I would've loved to see more of these ladies, in the original craft you saw more of that.How did the other girls got these powers? I mean, according to the stepdad they should've gotten this bye someone else-The ending, I loved it and hated it. So Lily is Nancy child ? Okay but Nancy lost her powers, right? So how did she give it to her child? When did this all happen :O ?
-The stepdad was the evil one here so I get that but was he Manon (don't know if I wrote that correctly) Or who/what was he?
-Killing or made the stepdad disappear was way to easy
Timmy could've gotten a bigger role imo. You would've , again, more character development and could feel more sentimental. Now I was like: So he tells his secret , his stepsister digs him and puts another spell on him and the next day followed up being killed by his dad!? What....?-Would've loved to see the girls using their magic more on other ways. In the craft you see them really doing spells and trickery on themselves. I missed it a bit in this movie except for some parts. They're teenagers...what would you've done if you could do magic?So still give this a 6 because I think there will be a third part and I would love to see this happening and I hope they'll do something with advice given by the audience.",The Craft - Legacy

A few characteristics I love about this film is the low-budget feel almost every blumhouse film has but sometimes it can feel like a syfy original (aka, the ""final"" act).

I really missed the darkness of the original.I thought it was a remake, the new 4 seem to be very similar to the originals as were the scenes in the woods and the levitation spell. I like that they didn't turn on each other though but we're trying to protect themselves from themselves, but because of the need of a bad guy I felt Duchovny's character was a fleshless attempt. I would've preferred it to have been the eldest brother and develop that character. There were far too many characters with little backstory and little to do. Timmy was great but then killed off without real exploration. Plus the cameo at the end felt like a last minute u-turn to change it into a sequel.I think it would've actually made a great Netflix exclusive, with 10 or so episodes to make use of the characters, give them more backstory and really develop the ideas that were touched on.As a movie I enjoyed it and am glad I saw it on the big screen but I'm left feeling like it deserved more.",The Craft - Legacy

We followed the character Lily moving to her new school and home with her mother, new step-father and 3 new siblings. Very simple yet conveying graphics and spells. This movie does a great job at paying homage to the original without it being a retelling and more of a continuation. If you are into wicca in television/film, this is a good watch for you and a cup of wine. The actresses did a great job and the guy who played the character Timmy, brought tears to me.

Now, I haven't seen the first movie, nor do I like horror-movies, so I can't comment on that. However, I think this movie isn't the best, but it doesn't deserve such a low rating either.I really liked the first half of this movie. It seemed like a stereotypical American high school movie, but in a good way. It was great to see the girls stand up for each other and it was downright hilarious to see their 'bully' turn into such a sensitive, respectful guy. There were a lot of heartfelt scenes that I enjoyed watching and I also liked the pop culture references. Overall, solid eight.Now, the second half of the movie... I won't give out too many spoilers, but this is the part where the magic and horror is supposed to happen. It was full of plot-holes and had a very confusing story. It was like they forgot they weren't making a high-school movie and this was some kind of last-minute idea. Also, I'm not an expert in this at all, but the special effects just looked bad and unrealistic.The movie started out with a lot of potential, but I can't rate it anywhere above a six.

The first scene when all the girls meet up together, they start talking about the one being a ""twilight Stan"" and throwing just about every buzzword into that scene alone. It was cringey and unnecessary. The acting was ... meh. I hated how they blamed Lily for mixing spells after whatshisface died (he was so useless I don't remember his name), but they were at fault for just throwing her into witchcraft without explaining the rules and restrictions. The only likable character was Tabby. And the ending, while great, was extremely predictable, as was much of the rest of the movie. It's not a long movie, give it a go, but know what you're watching. It's not groundbreaking.",The Craft - Legacy

210,makaylamoss-14481,"The movie was great, it's just the fans aren't",10,8 June 2021,"This movie was great, the problem is it's viewers aren't watching it with fresh eyes. A lot of people's complaints are centered around how the movie didn't have enough horror themes, and exaggerated scariness like the first version of this movie had. BUT that's exactly why this movie is great. It speaks to the realism of witchcraft in present day. First off, people practice witchcraft today but it isn't demonic and evil like. It actually is for the morally good. Terminology like ""higher good"" is exactly what people say when practicing magic today. Manifestation and meditation are modern day magical practices. That terminology and practices were all incorporated in the movie which actually made it super authentic. Therefore people shouldn't be expecting these teenagers to do awfully evil things either. Complaints also center around how these girls weren't wicked enough. The little things they did honestly were realistic, and sensible to a theoretical situation where teenage girls actually have magic. Those girls deciding to change a boys mindset for his highest good instead of hexing him is genuinely something people do in real life. That's because most people who practice magic in real life know that hexing comes with karmic consequences. Yes teenage witches are capable of understanding this. Their teenage mind was still so underdeveloped that they bound their magic and punished their witch sister for what they assumed was her fault. They went to extreme measures without good understanding. That is something a teen would ALSO realistically do. Just because they made morally conscious decisions doesn't meant they didn't have the brain of actual teenagers. They weren't following a moral high ground in the moment when they bound their magic, but rather were following fear. That is a perfect arch to how learning as a teenager happens. One of the themes in this movie had to do with how people often make assumptions on people's character based on fear and ignorance without learning the truth or understanding that person on a deeper level. That was a great message in this movie. The girls judged their witch sister without investigation. The male father judged the intentions of lily for changing the heart and mind of Timmy. Timmy judged lily for her period blood in the beginning of the movie. All of these people made bad decisions when making assumptions or judging a person, and that showed. The teenage girls also used their magic to do silly things like hit a girls head against a wall. These girls truly did act like normals teens. That was refreshing and great to see. The movie didn't have to portray a bunch of toxic teen girls acting wild with magic, because that wouldn't be realistic. It was interesting and introspective without having to have that extra edge. Hollywood has definitely warped people's minds into thinking that witchcraft is always supposed to be portrayed in movies and shows as Halloween like, and evil. But this movie did a good job of straying away from those stereotypes. I love the decisions they made with the character costumes , down to the details of the colors they wore. The symbolisms made sense. Snakes are often representative of spiritual changes, they can represent something bad or good. Made sense that the father would pose as such a huge turning point in Lily's life and ultimately be a huge test to her magic, and his family emblem would have two crossing snakes. That snake was a great precursor of what was to come. If people knew more about magic, paganism, or spirituality maybe they would see how these themes showed up in the movie and were very authentic. The flicker of black eyes to express demonic and domineering power is realistic for the evil father. People expect devil horns and alien skin, but that just is gimmicky and once again doesn't speak to what witchcraft is in society. Another great part of the movie is the message in the end, which can actually be really uplifting for women. Ever heard of God is a woman? Most will say that is blasphemy since everyone always heard it the other way around. People often hear that Man is God. This movie challenged that way of thinking. The father accused Lily of making Timmy into her image, and then said that she was wrong and threw off the natural order of things. He then proceeded to say that he (and suggestively other men) are women's rulers and kings. But the movie expressed clearly that women are capable of ruling their own world and possessing morality, in which they used to help people. In a way that is representative of how God operates. One could say the movie correlated to women doing the work of God, and using a power God gave them. Men who are obsessed with power do not understand or believe that women are capable of having it and using it, and foolishly think women are trying to be more than God and be more than men, thus men try to control women in society, not realizing their strength, power, and honest capability to help. All of what I mentioned are topics and subjects that exist in modern society. No one has to believe in witchcraft or God, or that God is a women to watch this movie and understand how it is realistic to society. No one had to believe these things to see the value in the messages. There is still gimmicks and glitter, but to judge the movie for not overdoing it in the gimmicks and glitter department is to be ignorant to the potential of including more realism in a movie centered around witchcraft culture.",The Craft - Legacy
211,amylorensings,"A new movie for a new generation, a bit underrated.",6,30 October 2020,"Geez, some of these user reviews are harsh! I watched this right after watching the original and it is a very different movie. You may find it crazy that the actors playing the high school girls actually look high school age. You may be disappointed that it shows a lighter side of magic. You might think the adult actors in the movie did not give their best performances. I don't know why anyone would be put out by the girls' strong sisterhood bond and even their kindness. If you're a guy, you may feel slightly threatened because it blasts feminism and equality. It's true, the characters aren't developed and the ending leaves you with a lot of questions.

I am a die hard Craft fan and this ""new"" Craft movie doesn't take away from the old. Aside from the ending, it has no reference to the orignal movie. Is this a horror movie? No, not by any means. It isn't edgy or dark like the original. Its a teen version of a witchy movie. I think if it was called something different, the reception would have been much better. Its a teen flick, not an adult flick. Adults needs character building and depth and this doesn't offer it. Watch it for what it is.

This version is insipid, shallow, uninteresting, poorly acted and advances the ideas of the first movie into ludicrous, Disney directions (telepathy, glitter etc). This movie did not need to exist.

The thing that makes it great is that behind all the magic, it feels real and dark. This movie, on the other hand, feel childish. I understand that we are at the year 2020, but you don't have to act like little girls and force all representation of minorities and have ridiculous unnecessary CGI effects to make a good story about witches and be politically correct. So, the corniness and over the top politically correctness hurts the seriousness of the plot and steals whatever integrity the movie could have had. Be aware, this is NOT a remake. This is a continuation, as the title suggests, it is a legacy of sorts. What I loved about the first one, The Craft, apart from the awesome 90s nostalgia, is that the characters were believable. The tone is solemn. The characters here, aside from the principal actress which is very good, they all act like cartoons. This is not a horrific 4.0 rating movie but it is not great.

No character development... I didn't care about anyone at all. It ended and I was like.. What that's it? Surely it's not finished. Horrible movie and frankly, insulting to the actual legacy that is The Craft, which inspired a whole generation of young witches, the world over.
They threw in some random lines from the first movie in a thinly veiled attempt at connecting them.
The first The Craft gave us characters we liked, identified with, friendships to envy and then the sadness when those friendships break down. There was mental illness, young love, and of course witchcraft, albeit a fantasised version of.
This poor knock off had none of that. A random massive period leakage at the begining, which was completely unnecessary and the small occurrences after could have been brought fourth in so many other, less degrading ways.
The actual witchcraft part was almost nonexistant, except for some strange montages with cgi trickery.

But it was SO bad I felt I had to come and leave my own thoughts on why.First of all, no-one changes, learns or grows. With the exception of Timmy, who gets a magic personality transplant, comes out as bi, then gets killed. (#buryyourgays) No-one has to struggle, fail, and learn to come back stronger.The magic is ridiculous. Stupid glitter effects, and way over powered. And just like above, they don't have to work for it at all. Glowing auras and they can throw fire balls, and there are levels that mean different abilities, like talking telepathically, and shapeshifting? What the eff?The internal logic is faulty. Fourth girl turns up and suddenly they can all do crazy magic, including pausing time? Somehow? In the cafeteria? And breaking into Timmy's house for the aforementioned personality spell. And knocking some mean girl's head into a wall? But Lily does a love spell on Timmy and that's crossing a line and the other three refuse to talk to her, and decide to take away all of their powers. Not only that, but they refuse to talk to her when she is trying to say something isn't right about Timmy's death... priorities?!Everything seems unconnected. The stuff the girls do is just glitz and glamour but doesn't go anywhere, there are scenes with the three sons that are just random - sleep-walking Isiah? Lily chatting outside with Abe? Adam is obviously not a good guy, but the ""shocking"" discovery that he's a warlock and wants to steal Lily's powers didn't really have anything leading up to it. And how did he know she HAS powers? Did her adopted Mom know?Nothing has any repercussions! Including the girls burning Adam alive in the middle of the forest, and then next thing adopted-Mom is picking Lily up to go visit her bio-Mom. The one who made her adoption dependent on Lily never being told she's adopted. What about the fact that this famous dude is now missing with no body to be found?! What happened to his boys? Not that we care at all about them, cause they have no personality, but still.And yes, Nancy is Lily's (Lilith's) bio-Mom - shock reveal! Except there was literally nothing leading up to this also. Okay, so Lily finds out she's adopted, but couldn't there have been some other hints that it's Nancy? Couldn't there have been powers she manifested as a kid? Some reference to Sarah perhaps - Robin Tunney's character from the original film, who presumably is still out there and powered up.I think the film would have been so much better if they kept it simpler and closer to the original. Don't get me wrong, I support the inclusivity, but I think so much of the stuff with Timmy should have been ditched, all the stuff with Adam's men's groups should have gone, and we should have had Lily having some faint, can't emphasize enough very weak, powers since she was little, maybe weird dreams and not understanding them, Adam somehow finding out she's Nancy's daughter and setting up his whole thing with adopted-Mom just to get close to her, and where we see Adam learning about Nancy, we the audience get drip fed hints that it is Nancy as well as about his own powers / agenda.They should also have picked one or two magic abilities and gradually ramped them up, like in the original film they start off a glamour with Sarah changing her hair to blonde, and at the finale she's taunting Nancy with the glamoured-snake-hands. So Lily meets the girls in school and they introduce her to witchcraft and suddenly things in her past are making more sense, AND all their powers can start that ramp up. Then she could find her adoption certificate AND the other stuff Adam has about Nancy, Sarah etc and she could confront her Mom who would not have known Adam knew anything about Nancy. Mom confronts Adam, gets tied up, and cue the final show-down in the forest.",The Craft - Legacy

the Craft Legacy shows a modern version of a working coven with some fantastical entertaining pieces of magic as well as important spells. The diversity and and whole message of the movie becomes clear when we find that Lily's soon-to-be step-dad is a professional misogynist.The entrance of a male practitioner, a Warlock that steals witches powers, sealed the deal with David Duchovny playing the role of the dark side of the Craft, which resides in the Witch's heart and intentions, not the magic.
The meat of the films plot line is revealed towards the end and it will blow your mind away that Nancy Downs, played by Fairuza Balk AGAIN, is in the films ending asking lily ""what she wants"", and lily replying ""I'm your daughter""... was so awesome!! The ending was fulfilling and also hints at the possibility of another film! Let's pray to The Goddess it happens!!",The Craft - Legacy
285,bilgealp,what did i just watch,6,28 October 2020,Honestly this was such a disappointment to see. This movie contains more like a cliche teen high school movie elements instead of thriller/horror. I personally can't see any horror items in it. I hate how they never mentioned main characters' backstories or their daily lives. And there were SO many plotholes that i can't catch up while watching. Literally I'm so disappointed rn just go and watch the original one and don't waste ur time watching this. In the end I'd like these characters so much if writers wrote them better.

The young people in the cast are doing their best with what they're given. The adults are very much there for a paycheck and I don't blame them. It's probably for the best this couldn't go to theaters because yikes it's almost as worse as Jem.",The Craft - Legacy

Was the step dad menor? Some stuff in the trailer wasn't even in the film? First they was friends then they were best friends? Then they was practising then all of the sudden they're these powerful coven? The ending with the step dad? Felt like I blinked and it was over? How was the adoptive mum connected to Nancy? There was no character development at all with no one, and I hate to be so negative about this cause I really thought it looked good but I was left so disappointed. And what was that ending with the step dad that was it? They really should have left this one alone or if anything brought the original 4 back and continued some type of story with them.

As a child I always thought if I wished hard enough that I could change the bad things around me. This drew me in to the movie. So I was particularly excited about the sequel once I found out it was indeed a sequel and not a remake. Something seemed off about Adam from the beginning. Then her dreams she kept having. Isaiah freaking out. Timmys result. It twisted pretty good. I thought it would have been Isaiah who caused Timmys issue. I would have liked to have gotten to see it in theatres instead of at home but it is what it is. I opted for $24.99 to own. Expensive. But $19.99 to rent so now I just own.,The Craft - Legacy
300,rudeboiimars,A waste,1,29 October 2020,I get that changing things with the time was important but the craft was never a friendly little movie for the kids. The fact that blumhouse produced such a film that should have been in daytime TV surprises me. I mean charmed has more edge than this.

Why wasn't this done before?...however, 24 years later we finally arrive at the Craft II Legacy - which certainly has a legacy to live up to. The film directed by Zoe Lister Jones, isn't as a compelling or Dark as its predecessor, (note for 3rd film) however what it does deserves credit for is its attempt (in this modern world) to curate a worthy ""sequel"" instead of the annoy trend to remake/reboot everything. I wont say to much, but this film is vastly connected to the first with its jaw dropping cameo and finale scene. The only let down to this movie is the 3rd act where David Duchovny gets quickly - brought down by this new mesmerizing coven of witches, however, no attempt is shown as to how the main character saved her beloved adoptive mother - nor what happened to her step brothers!!!!.... aside from the small bug bares - this film acts as the perfect stop gap - to a more compelling third film!!! please blumhouse!!!! which will hopefully bring back the original OG cast (cough Rachel True, Neve Campbell, Robin Tunney & Fairuza Balk)----as well as this new cast of delicious witches.... if you like the first, you will like this....",The Craft - Legacy

People are also complaining about no explanation of the other girls' powers; they clearly state they have been looking for a 4th for a long time and have been practicing magic for all that time as well. That's all we need to know about them. Movie is a solid 5 to 6 rating. It's not a horror movie and I'm not sure why anyone would expect it to be. These other reviewers must not have seen the 1996 movie which also was not a horror movie. I hate when people who know nothing about films leave bad reviews for a movie.

I mean, I got most of the bullet points of the story, but it seemed carelessly thrown together in a way that wouldn't make sense to someone without it being awkwardly spelled out to them after the fact. Some of the antagonists' motivations were pretty damn shaky ""Yes, let's murder a teenager I'm not really close to at all because his personality is no longer the way I like it.""
I also felt like diversity characters were included just to be there, rather than to enrich the story. It felt like a bit of a gimmick since they were just paraded in front of the camera, without any connection to the story.

313,gracelbarry,This movie is awful and I love it,10,1 November 2020,"I literally made this account specifically to review this movie, and to reply to sickpuppy365.When I first read that review, before I watched the movie, I thought to myself ""ah, here is a man with a stick up his ass. Ah, here is someone who thinks that gay people existing is ""too in his face"".Then I watched the movie. I think something to take into consideration in my review is that I am a lesbian who will grab every bit of diversity I can get. I love it.My mind cannot comprehend how terrible this movie was. I love it like nothing else in the world. It's a perfect microcosm of ""look at me! Praise me! I'm Woke!"" culture. Let me explain the movie.There are three girls who are attempting to form a witches coven. One of them is black. One of them is implied to be trans. Because for Inclusion Purposes, you need Diversity. They finally find their fourth witch, after Misogyny (TM) forces her to divulge her Cool Necklace (TM) that is a magic witch symbol. One of their firsts acts as a coven is to make the school bully (who I literally don't remember the name of because his character, at this point in the movie, is literally just DudeMan Heterosexual Sports Schoolbully(tm)) a better version of himself.DudeMan Heterosexual Sports Schoolbully goes on a CHARACTER 360. IT IS INCREDIBLE. He goes from, yknow, dudebro schoolbullying to talking about cisgender privilege, heteronormativity, toxic masculinity, etc etc. The coven goes to a Teen Party where there are red solo cups (so you know that they're drinking), dudeman sportsbully apologizes sincerely to the MC for being misogynistic. He then says that he will not participate in teen drinking, and that he has a stash of sparkling water in the basement and a playlist full of Woke(tm) musicians like Princess Nokia. Dudeman Sportsbully later comes out to the witches coven as bisexual and they have a whole moment about how it's really hard to be bisexual if you're a man (It is! But the writing of this scene is. It's something). Also he dies at some point.The rest of the movie is pretty much about how David Duchovony runs a cult and wants to take the MC's magic special powers, because she's not using them correctly, and magic special powers need to have control and not be ruled by emotion. This is totally not a commentary on how men view emotion as weak, it is not at all a commentary on that.So it ends in a POWER RANGERS SHOWDOWN where the mc's Girl Group comes to her rescue, because Female Friendship. They defeat the Bad White Heterosexual Privilege man with the powers of female friendship and connection to the earth.This movie is the funniest thing i've seen in my life. If you were to watch it as a horror movie, yeah, it sucks. It absolutely blows. There's MAYBE one scene that's a little scary.It's like the writers took a group of Woke 14-25 year olds, asked them exactly what they wanted in a movie an a character, and did exactly that. It's pandering to the maximum. I swear to god, someone is going to do a thesis on this movie in 10 years about how it perfectly exemplifies the Wokeness culture of 2020. They just take all these archetypes and tropes and RUN with them. It is, to it's bones, an awful movie.I love it so goddamn much.",The Craft - Legacy

This remake is an embarrassment to everyone and should not have any connection to the original at all.
Could not connect to any of the characters. There was no story behind any of them, no personality and just felt they tried to modernise everything with no foundation or emotion.
Felt rushed as nothing made sense. I had to rewind some parts to see if I had missed something which I didn't, it was just terrible film making.
There were no connection to Wicca or witchcraft apart from a little chant of the corners. I didn't even finish the movie. I had to turn it off... was like what am I actually watching here.Pointless waste of money and time movie.Bring back the original and anyone wanting to bring the original craft back to life might as well go back and watch the old one.

However there is little to no character development for anyone. Men are the evil factor in the movie very heavy handidly. The amount of the main characters being ""woke"" and very proud of there progressive stances overshadow any and all point to the movie. All that aside, the pacing is odd, there are plot points that lead nowhere and plot holes that just remain unfilled. Poorly written movie, it's clear the actors and effect team did there best with a horrible creation of some uninspired sequel to a fantastic movie.

Not a patch on the original,6,22 November 2020,Ok so I read all the other reviews and become so disappointed the craft is one of my favourite films..when they announced they were doing a sequel all them years ago i was so excited..anyway I decided to give it a go. And yes there are some major plot holes and lack of story progression for all the other characters a previous reviewer said he couldn't remember the other 3 witches names. I have to agree..however to say there is no magic in the film is a bit of a lie. There is lots of magic..Not like the first film..more.like they have powers. It's like charmed..this film had so much potential and I was a little disappointed but I still think it's worth a watch. I think this is a another film-remake-sequal that fell to the covid curse. I feel they must of edited way too much out..It's a pity. Last 30.seconds was.good.,The Craft - Legacy

322,sinisterohana,"Watch this movie, only if you have a detailed mind",10,5 December 2020,"When I found out that there was a ""sequel"" to The Craft i was really excited and couldn't wait to watch it. Before I jumped into this film I read the reviews and was amazed by the amount of negative reviews and still watched it. Being a fan of the original ""The Craft"" & ""Charmed"" I didnt let the reviews stop me from watching.And honestly I truly enjoyed this movie. Reviews stated there wasn't magic involved in which there wasnt that much but to me it was enough. But the underlining to the movie was alittle deeper than ""magic"". It showed the hardships our young women face growing up with life changes, in school, becoming social and finding themselves. For those living with deep secrets that could alter their lives in the future and to have a potential label placed on them.Being a father of a 1 year old little girl and expecting our 2nd daughter it ""Awoken"" me to understand what they will face growing up and knowing that they too will have to seek out that power to be strong growing up. The true power to this movie symbolizes sisterhood and not just hocus pocus like the original movie. But its gives us a third eye to what is really going on in modern day living.So I give Blum & Zoe a 10/10 on this film. I hope that my review helps other truly understand what this movie really shows and dont try to compare this to the original.",The Craft - Legacy

This film captured none of the spirit of the 1996 version and in an odd way felt more like a episode of the tv show Charmed. The scenes were rushed, no character development and little to no witchcraft. How can you have a an entire movie about witches with so little actual witchcraft?

It quickly turned into Mystery Science 3000 with our laughter and comments.Let's forget the serious lack of character development or back story for any of them... a few things bugged me. First, the period scene. Was this an all-male production crew? It looked like someone opened a few ketchup packets and smeared them. This is what you think a woman's period looks like...?Secondly, in this day and age they couldn't have hired an actual trans actor to play the trans girl? Talk about a slap in the face to the LGBT+ community. She wasn't even trying with her pixie voice. A tall girl in black lipstick doesn't equal trans... that's called goth.As much as I loved seeing Nancy for all of three seconds in the end, how was she knocked up while in the psych ward? Who is this girl's father?Lastly, the fashion in this movie was absolutely terrible. It was like they were trying to make the ""witches"" as extreme (woke? Hip?) as possible. The wardrobe was a complete distraction.I want my $8 back.",The Craft - Legacy
337,HarryOru,Just an incompetently made mess,2,1 November 2020,"It's funny that a movie so concerned with being as woke/feminist as possible ultimately portrays all of its female characters as a bunch of flat, insipid Mary Sue's. It felt at best like a pilot for a low-budget Netflix show that would get cancelled after one season.While the original had atmosphere, memorable characters, a coherent storyline and a poignant climax, this soft reboot/sequel feels more like a collection of tropes that would've made eyes roll even back in 1996. Its awful pacing is made even worse by the fact that it spends way too much screentime setting up storylines for a sequel that will probably never happen. Quite a shame since most of the cast was very likeable (Mr. Duchovny, though... What the heck was he doing?? Cause whatever it was clearly wasn't ""acting"".)I see some reviewers chalk its flaws up to it being ""aimed at teens"" but I don't really see it as a valid justification since the much darker original was one of my favorite movies as a kid. I had pretty high hopes for this one taking advantage of the times and the Blumhouse association to go even darker, but it went the opposite way instead.I could go on for hours about all of this movie's flaws, but it really isn't worth my time, and it probably isn't worth your time either. Just steer clear of this one and go rewatch the original.",The Craft - Legacy

And though touted as a SEQUEL this movie is actually a RE-MAKE, including a near identical storyline, identical scenes and even word for word dialogue pulled directly from the original. The tacked on final scene is the ONLY aspect that could be argued to make this mess of a movie fall into the sequel category. Other than that single 30 second scene, make no mistake this is a RE-MAKE - and a very poor one at that.

This is garbage. And the ending? Laughable.",The Craft - Legacy
345,Akasha_Eyre,This film could've been good BUT... No.,2,2 November 2020,"As much as I love Fairuza Balk, especially as Nancy Downs, they should've left that character alone. Her being involved with this chewed-up bubble gum, new-age teen remix by wannabe ""woke"" Nickelodeon vibe they had going on in this film (when -or if- you watch this film, you'll understand what I mean) was a bad batch that very few would or could appreciate. It was an insult to all the fans who wanted to know what happened to Nancy and the rest of ""The Craft"" characters (who aren't even mentioned).If they had named the film something else & hadn't tried so hard to push that ""Men Are Evil, Women are Queens"" agenda the whole time (along with dragging my beloved Nancy into the mix), it might've been something worth watching. I mean, I gave ""Charmed"" a chance (with Alyssa Milano. I'm not interested at all in the remake) and that was kind of a rip-off of ""The Craft"" BUT they didn't butcher the film or say it was associated and they didn't have to. We knew it was something that was ""inspired"" by the movie. And then it turned into an entirely different thing. This could've been like ""Charmed"" and then they wouldn't have had to bring back an iconic character from the previous film to try to legitimize this.Now, unlike a lot of other people that have reviewed this film, I have to admit, there were some things I did like about this one. I liked how the three girls seemed to have an understanding of how magic was meant to be used and that they realized that with great power comes great responsibility. And I did enjoy how the three girls backed the new girl almost immediately (coming to her rescue after her menstruation situation was beautiful and I wish that more people were as understanding as those three girls in that embarrassing moment). I also liked that even though there was an issue with a boy, it wasn't like the previous movie. There wasn't any jealousy among them. In fact, there wasn't any real emotions in this film at all (except for that one young man in the movie making his confession).This is the problem that Hollywood has been having lately. All these remakes and sequels and prequels, trying to one-up each other or capture the magic of the originals and they've lost the heart and soul that went into the first project which is what made it so transcendent. It's like they've run out of original ideas and are now just running with anything they can think up without taking the time to make a proper script or give any explanations for anything that's happening in the films. A little more thought and a lot more heart would've gone a long way.Also, why the bloody hell did they do my David Duchovny like that?! WHY?!",The Craft - Legacy

There's no character development, the girls all basically have the same personality, the power development happens too quickly and too strongly. This reminded me of Charlie's Angels, but without the intentional camp. It kills me how they talk about in the Making Of This Movie how this movie is empowering and being uplifting for people who don't fit in.

I must say i was hesitant to enjoy this movie, yet i have to tell after finishing it 2 mins ago, that this movie was By Far AMAZING! The magic is Contemporary to the times, the Visual Effects were Pretty Ok, And while this movie had a Errie, Alien, Moroccan Like Soundtrack, i gotta be honest when i say im happy they did it exactly like this! True magic is not biased by opinion of what it should or shouldn't be. And the only witches and warlocks that get upset at the glitter scenes clearly havent stepped into their true power and have self doubt at whats possible! Never ever put on constraint on what YOU can accomplish! This movie does a Prime example at teaching the Ego not to Label or judge magic and say what is possible vs what isnt, but instead takes a delightful, childlike approach by showing magic in many flavours and colours!

Literally the same, 3 needing a 4th, and they sort of skip way to quickly into everything, It's like they got powers for years 20 minutes in, controlling every power fire from the fingers, slamming peoples head to walls, telepathy. Think of it like a bad remake of Craft with Disney channel unknowns vs the original. Watch it just with one eye while checking your tweets because you won't miss anything, you can sort of guess what comes next. Im 40 minutes in as I write this, and he's all under their spell a nasty boy turned good (Skeet Ulrich's part from Craft except his was 100% better).

I enjoy light entertainment, chick flicks or teen movies, as well as the deeper ones. But this, I could not enjoy.It had beginnings of a good story, even if the magic was rushed, it was enjoyable to see the girls having fun and being witches. Timmy's story with the eldest step brother had such a great start, then it fizzled into a non event. How did the 'warlock' (he was that bad I have forgotten his name) know about Lily? Did the 3 sons know? After the woods incident is he burned? Dead? In hell? What happened? Where are the sons after this? So so many unanswered questions so I am sorry for the rambling.Don't waste your time thinking this will be a horror film, there is one tiny 'jump scare' that fails on every level.

Maybe if there's nothing else to watch. Here's the problem: when you hear ""sequel"", you typically picture it to be as good, if not better than the first movie. Unfortunately this movie didn't live up to it's expectations because it's made with different writers, directors and just a completely different vision. It's also very PC and not so dark compared to the original, which is quite the letdown if you're into that 90s grunge feel. Also a little anticlimactic if you ask me.

Firstly, I feel there is a hell of a lot of unjustified hatred being aimed at this film. Yes, it is woke. Woke AF! It's definitely a product of life in 2020 which I think is great. It had a lot going on so the film could have done with being longer to give us some more in depth knowledge about certain characters and their storyline but it didn't try to be the original movie. It really made itself its own entity which I'm so pleased about. There was a shedload of Easter eggs which I loved spotting. The chemistry between the Coven is amazing!!! All the girls are great. Their bond was lovely to see. It was very respectful to Witchcraft practice. It thankfully didn't fall into the final act of the first film which I always felt upset by. And.... That final scene has me terribly excited for another film Blumhouse!

They should have gone into more detail about the stepfather, his family crest and his cult it was just tossed in there. I was left wanting so much more from the final battle it was so mediocre and it just fizzled out. Nancy wasn't a natural witch and she was bound at the end of the first film so how did she have a daughter born with natural given powers they didn't even explain the amulet that was given to her at birth. It would have been so much better if she was Sarah's daughter and the stepfather was just a glamoured Nancy out for revenge who had previously killed Sarah and made it look like a suicide after giving birth. Even in the scene where she was looking into the mirror at night I wanted Nancy to pop out and possess her or something but it was just a sleepwalking stepbrother.

374,ealangille-84856,Horrible,1,11 April 2021,A lot of nothing happened in the 1.5hrs that is this movie. So many questions were left unanswered and it felt all over the place and rushed. This movie was so disappointing.,The Craft - Legacy
375,brandonedwards-31356,Sequel? More of a remake,3,1 November 2020,"Not really a sequel. No mention or reference to the characters from the original until the very end. It seemed to have a very similar storyline to the original with the binding and the spells the girls did. So not very original. More of a teen movie and less horror which was disappointing as the original is very dark. This movie was a let down by an amateur plot and script, but the effects were good. The story only built up within the last half an hour which was annoying. Acting was meh, It was worth the watch, but does not do the original the justice it deserves unfortunately.",The Craft - Legacy
376,mpkasik,DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME,1,29 October 2020,"What an absolutely abysmal excuse for a film. Everything is so rushed and chaotic that nothing makes sense. The story is convoluted and pointless, there's precisely zero character development, the acting is about as flat and unconvincing as can be and the dialogue is just plain goofy. A horrible follow-up to a great cult classic.",The Craft - Legacy
377,ssmith-30790,"Bad, really bad",2,22 March 2021,This was bad on a whole new level. Plot didn't make sense. So many loose end that didn't seem remotely linked.,The Craft - Legacy
