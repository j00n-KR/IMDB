0,MartinHafer,Not as bad as many reviewers said when it debuted...but Pacino was pretty bad.,5,27 July 2020,"When ""Dick Tracy"" debuted, I remember two things. First, that DIsney spent a crapload of money producting 10001 different tie-in toys for kids based on the film. Second, most professional reviewers savaged the film...and yet it made money. Now, 30 years later, I'm rewatching the movie.My first reaction when I began watching the film was that it was an incredibly adult movie...way too adult for the kids to whom it was marketed. Machine gun battles, folks being buried in cement and Madonna wearing practically nothing....all of which make this Disney film an absolute nightmare for decent parents. There is just no way I'd ever let a kid watch this movie....none.If you look past all the violence and sex, what's left is an interesting film. The look of the movie is the best thing about it. It looks more like a comics page than any film I can recall....and I liked that. Most of the baddies were pretty cool to see and watch and the movie was rarely ever dull. But there still is one thing I didn't like about the movie...one thing that is really controversial. I think Al Pacino was terrible in the film! He was never subtle, always loud and brash and spent the entire film eating the scenery.Overall, this is a very mixed bag...some good, some bad...and a movie I'd never show anyone under about age 10 or 12.",Dick Tracy
1,TheLittleSongbird,Not perfect but an achievement in a lot of ways,8,2 July 2014,"The cast are reason enough to check out Dick Tracy, and in a lot of ways you are not left short-changed. Dick Tracy is not without its flaws, the story does feel rushed at times with scenes and character development(with the exception of Charlie Korsmo) that feel skimmed over. And, for me, Warren Beatty does a better job directing the film than acting in it, here in the title role he underplays and comes across as rather stiff and even for a character who's meant to be too laconic. His directing is great though, Dick Tracy was clearly made with love and with a clear sense that Beatty knew what he was doing, and while the story is at times skimpy and lacking in depth it is told with a lot of warmth and fun, the deliberate pacing not hurting it a bit. The atmosphere is wonderfully surreal and really draws you in, the homages to gangster movies are very well done. Adaptation-wise, it is a little tamer compared to the comic strip but with the surreal atmosphere, the dialogue that balances amusing comedy and grim seriousness very well and the colourful portrayals of the villains the essence of a comic strip is there. Danny Elfman's score is a contender for his most playful if in places reminiscent of Batman and Stephen Sondheim's songs are equally great, Sooner or Later being the highlight, in fact the whole soundtrack works. What is particularly good about Dick Tracy are the cast and the visuals, both of which manage to be great achievements. Of the cast the standout is Al Pacino who seems to be enjoying himself immensely and is hilarious, that he has the best lines and is the most memorable character helps. Charlie Korsmo is endearing(better than he was in Hook at any rate) in one of the more memorable characters in the film, while Glenne Headley does sympathetic very well and even Madonna is surprisingly good. Dustin Hoffmann fares best in the large supporting cast, all of whom are solid. Visually, Dick Tracy looks absolutely incredible and most likely one of the most striking films of the 90s, with lavish costumes and sets and plentiful colours that are incredibly rich and vivid. Plus the make-up is superb. The photography is equally gorgeous. To conclude, Dick Tracy may not be a perfect film but achieves a lot. 8/10 Bethany Cox",Dick Tracy
2,bkoganbing,Crime Fighter Extraordinaire,9,16 November 2009,"At one end of the Eighties Warren Beatty created and starred in the literate epic Reds about the founding of the Soviet Union as seen through the eyes of iconoclast radical John Reed. It was a profound film both entertaining and with a message presented by an all star cast. At the end of the decade Warren Beatty created another kind of epic in Dick Tracy that makes no pretense to being anything other than entertainment with a whole bunch of the best actors around just having a great old time hamming it up under tons of makeup.That both Reds and Dick Tracy could come from the same individual speaks volumes about the range this man has as a player. In this film Beatty managed to get all the famous cartoon characters from the strip and put them in one original screenplay.The city's top mobster Big Boy Caprice is making a move to really eliminate competition. The film opens with him rubbing out Lips Manlis's henchmen in a Valentine Massacre style shooting and then Lips himself being fitted for a cement overcoat. But Caprice's moves are making him a target for Tracy.In the meantime a third mysterious and faceless individual is looking to topple Caprice himself. Will our hero sort out this thicket of crime?The spirit of fun this film has is truly infectious. When people like Al Pacino, Dustin Hoffman, Paul Sorvino, William Forsythe, R.G. Armstrong get themselves outrageously made-up to look like the cartoon creations of strip author Chester Gould and then indulge in an exercise of carving the biggest slice of ham, you've got to love this film.Al Pacino got a nomination for Best Supporting Actor, but any of these guys could have, it's only that Pacino as Big Boy Caprice gets the most screen time. Only Beatty plays it completely straight, the others all seem to play off of him. Dick Tracy won Oscars for Best Art&Set Design, Best Song written by Stephen Sondheim and introduced by Madonna, Sooner Or Later. The fact he was even able to get somebody like Sondheim to write a score for this film only shows Sondheim wanted to get in on the fun. As for Madonna, the Material Girl does more than hold her own with all these acting heavyweights as club torch singer Breathless Mahoney.Before this film, Dick Tracy movies were consigned to the B pictures and worse as Saturday afternoon serials. The only thing that rivals this all star extravaganza is a radio broadcast done for Armed Forces Radio during World War II that got to vinyl. Can you believe a cast like Bing Crosby, Bob Hope, Frank Sinatra, Dinah Shore, Jimmy Durante, Judy Garland, Frank Morgan, and the Andrews Sisters? Try and find a recording of that gem.Until then Warren Beatty's classic comic strip for the big screen will do nicely.",Dick Tracy
3,SnoopyStyle,colorful comics,6,26 August 2016,"Alphonse ""Big Boy"" Caprice (Al Pacino) is a crime boss in the city. Mumbles (Dustin Hoffman, Flattop (William Forsythe), and Itchy (Ed O'Ross) are some of his henchmen. They're trying take down police detective Dick Tracy (Warren Beatty). Tess Trueheart (Glenne Headly) is his girlfriend. The Kid is a street orphan who steals Tracy's watch and then steals his heart. Big Boy kills Lips Manlis (Paul Sorvino) and takes his Club Ritz and singer Breathless Mahoney (Madonna).The story and the characters are simplistic. Madonna can be a distraction. The movie does achieve a technicolor style, and a watch-ability. As for the acting, there is a lack of depth in Beatty's Tracy. Madonna is really problematic and she doesn't fit the needed 50's bombshell persona. Al Pacino and the rest work fine. The Kid is meant to give Tracy heart but only the hungry montage is any fun. They don't really have the connection. This has the colorful originality but the movie gets flat over time.",Dick Tracy
4,Hitchcoc,Could Have Been a Franchise,7,6 January 2017,"Chisel Chinned Tracy is a unique character in comic book lore. Several movies were made back in the forties as he faced off against the master criminals of the time (like Cueball). In this film, they put all the eggs in one basket. Granted the thing is nice to look at with the bright primary colors. The plot is police work, only they decided to take darn near every villain that ever appeared in the comics and throw them at Tracy. What ensues is a who's who of actors who must have wanted to take a bit part in Beatty's movie. The plot is pretty ordinary, considering this cast, and we are left with no out as far as a sequel goes. Dick Tracy is interesting enough and surreal enough to engage us in several movies. Just FlatTop alone is a worthy adversary, doing the creative craziness that he does. Take any of them and you've got a movie (well, you could leave Mumbles out). Moderately entertaining but nothing very striking about this film.",Dick Tracy
5,Prismark10,Calling Dick Tracy,9,10 November 2013,"Dick Tracy was released in 1990. Tim Burton's Batman was released a year earlier and nearly a quarter of a century later, his take on the Dark Knight is looking its age.Dick Tracy on the other hand with its comic strip look and a colour palette of seven colours with a focus on primary colours looks fresh and dazzling even today.Warren Beatty was never an actor who chased populist vehicles. He rather made films that were thoughtful. Here as star and director Beatty deliberately went for a unique approach to the Chester Gould comic strip character.Only Ang Lee with his approach to the Hulk has shown that kind of originality.What Dick Tracy also has is a wealth of stars, many of them under heavy makeup. Al Pacino has a licence to chew the scenery even more than his Tony Montana.Madonna is sultry enough although she is not a strong enough actress but at least she gets to sing the Sondheim tunes.Beatty is believable as Dick Tracy, Glenne Headly is the one who is actually more sexy than Madonna as Tess Trueheart. There is an actual script with a decent storyline and it is one of the more original takes on a comic book adaptation ever made.Plaudits has to go to Beatty as star and director.",Dick Tracy
6,gavin6942,Criminally Underrated?,7,10 April 2014,"The comic strip detective (Warren Beatty) finds his life vastly complicated when Breathless Mahoney (Madonna) makes advances towards him while he is trying to battle Big Boy Caprice's united mob.After almost twenty-five years, this film is still entertaining, well-acted and just good fun. While a bit silly, this is part of the fun, and it is still amazing to see how many big names were willing to take parts where they would be hardly recognizable.Unfortunately, I think the weakest link is Danny Elfman's score. I hate to say hat, because I love Elfman's work, but he was coming off of ""Batman"" and many of the film's musical moments sound like recycled bits from that prior film.",Dick Tracy
7,lee_eisenberg,He's on his way...to a REALLY entertaining movie.,7,17 October 2005,"Usually, when we use the word ""escapist"", we mean it negatively; Warren Beatty's big screen version of ""Dick Tracy"" proves that ""escapist"" can be good. This is truly one entertaining movie. As the eponymous, yellow-clad, fearless title character, Beatty creates a detective to whom we can all relate: ready for action, but not without his weaknesses.From there, the rest of characters are almost a world unto themselves. Tess Truehart (Glenne Headly) is as glamorous as one would expect the hubby of any crime fighter to be; Breathless Mahoney (Madonna) is possibly the most perplexing person imaginable; Big Boy Caprice (Al Pacino) is the average villain: ruthless but cool. Other characters include the speech-challenged Mumbles (Dustin Hoffman), the over-musical 88 Keys (Mandy Patinkin), and The Kid (Charlie Korsmo). Charles Durning, James Caan, Dick Van Dyke, Estelle Parsons, Catherine O'Hara, Seymour Cassel, Paul Sorvino and Kathy Bates also star.Oh, wait a minute. I haven't even explained the plot! The plot involves Tracy trying - and failing so far - to find some way to nab Big Boy. Simultaneously, some very bizarre events have been going on in town, the answers to which may or may not be closer than everyone thinks.Of course, the main thing about this movie is that it's fun to watch. If Warren Beatty was having trouble acting his age, then he made good use of that here. ""Dick Tracy"" is one cool movie.",Dick Tracy
8,jboothmillard,Dick Tracy,6,29 December 2009,"I had seen a few images of the leading character for this 1940's comic book based film from director Warren Beatty, and it didn't look like much to be desired, but I decided to give it a chance. Basically police detective Dick Tracy (Beatty) has found a little urchin, calling himself Kid (Hook's Charlie Korsmo) who witnessed a crime by mob boss Big Boy Caprice (Oscar, BAFTA and Golden Globe nominated Al Pacino) and his gang, Shoulders (Stig Eldred), Stooge (Jim Wilkey), The Rodent (Neil Summers), The Brow (Chuck Hicks) and Little Face (Lawrence Steven Meyers). Tracy is the only one tough enough to take on the don and his mobsters, while trying also to be dedicated to his girlfriend Tess Trueheart (Glenne Headly). He is held back not just be the Kid and his love interest, but by the seductive Breathless Mahoney (Madonna), always by Big Boy's side, and trying to get into Tracy's head. Also in the midst is a faceless character known as The Blank killing both the people who are helping Big Boy out, and people who may be helpful in bringing him down. In the end, Big Boy is defeated by Tracy and the Kid, and The Blank is revealed as Breathless, so Tracy and Tess drive away happily, with the Kid in tow. Also starring The Princess Bride's Mandy Patinkin as 88 Keys, The Muppet Movie's Charles Durning as Chief Brandon, Paul Sorvino as Lips Manlis, William Forsythe as Flattop, Dustin Hoffman as Mumbles, James Caan as Spaldoni, Kathy Bates as Mrs. Green, Dick Van Dyke as D.A. Fletcher, Charles Fleischer as Reporter and Catherine O'Hara as Texie Garcia. The performances are alright, the songs by Sweeney Todd composer Stephen Sondheim aren't bad, and the story has its moments, so while it is a little childish and odd, it does have a few things to like. It won the Oscar for Best Art Direction-Set Decoration, Best Makeup, Best Song for Sondheim's ""Sooner or Later (I Always Get My Man)"" (also nominated the Golden Globe), it was nominated for Best Cinematography, Best Costume Design and Best Sound, it won the BAFTA for Best Make Up Artist and Best Production Design, and it was nominated for Best Costume Design, Best Editing, Best Sound and Best Special Visual Effects, and it was nominated the Golden Globes for Best Motion Picture - Comedy/Musical and Best Original Song for Sondheim's ""What Can You Lose?"". Good!",Dick Tracy
9,ccthemovieman-1,"Incredible Colors, Incredible Cast",9,21 March 2006,"This is amazing-looking movie with the whole thing done in just six or seven colors. When it came out over 15 years ago, it stunned audiences with its color scheme, being so different from anything else that had ever been put on film. Those colors, for me at least, make this an absolutely fascinating film to watch. There are literally thousands of scenes I wish could freeze and somehow convert them to a painting to study for their artwork.The characters and the story don't match up to the greatness of the photography, but they are all over-the-top, especially the villains. The famous actors who played them here must have a had a lot of fun on the set playing ""Flatop,"" ""Pruneface,"" ""Lips,"" ""Mumbles,"" etc.Meanwhile, Warren Beatty and Gleanne Hedley are good as Dick Tracey and girlfriend Tess Truehart, and she's as sweet and soft as her name. Another good addition is Charlie Korsmo as the delinquent young boy Dick and Tess take under their wing. The colorful other characters are played by Al Pacino, Dustin Hoffman, William Forysthe, Paul Sorvino, Mandy Patinkin, Madona and other names you know but are too numerous to list here. Check the full credits on the main page and you'll amazed.The only negatives I found were Pacino's voice which grates on you after awhile, Madonna's off-key singing voice and the fact that the film would have been better trimmed about 10 minutes. Those ""faults"" are all minor because overall, this is a fun movie....a cartoon strip coming to life in an incredibly-colorful fashion.....like nothing you have ever seen.",Dick Tracy

The timeless and imaginative settings capture the essence rather than reality of the city . There's so much music in the movie mostly from Mandy Patinkin and especially Madonna as the singer Breathless Mahoney doing her best screen acting to date .

11,moonspinner55,A noble failure...,4,19 March 2008,"Director Warren Beatty's intention to turn Chester Gould's famous comic strip into a live-action cartoon (with Beatty himself cast in the lead as the square-jawed detective) had sweet overtures of innocent nostalgia--quite unusual and intriguing coming from Warren Beatty. Unfortunately, the picture is requisite ham, fun for awhile but eventually tiring. Dick Tracy attempts to bring down mobster Big Boy Caprice, aided by loving Tess Trueheart but tripped up by evil Breathless Mahoney. For the first half-hour or so, the Oscar-winning art direction and set design are wonderful to absorb but, as the plot creaks along predictably (with no real sting in the writing), things begin to congeal. Al Pacino got a surprise Supporting Oscar nomination as bad boy Caprice, and Madonna (who is mostly used as a decorative prop) gets to sing Stephen Sondheim's ""Sooner or Later (I Always Get My Man)"", which copped the award for Best Original Song. Lots of heart, thanks to Beatty--who was dedicated to his vision--but the picture is too cool and calculated. It lacks heat. *1/2 from ****",Dick Tracy
12,Quinoa1984,"""colorful"" is the word to use for Dick Tracy, a marvel of its kind, an abstract blockbuster",10,1 January 2008,"Most successful comic book movies usually depend on having villains that are bigger than life, ready to jump off the screen and strangle you alive with a smile or a demented line or two of dialog. The Tim Burton Batmans had it, as did (in an even more grotesque manner) Sin City. With Dick Tracy producer/director/star Warren Beatty piles on the villains until it becomes part of the framework. Like a boisterous homage to 1930s gangster pictures- only this time meant for kids as opposed to the darker Bonnie and Clyde- Dick Tracy is filled, joyfully, with archetypes and bright, primary colors, where the criminals carry tommy guns and are formed on their faces to shape their personalities. Villains like The Stooge, Shoulders, Lips, The Brow, Mumbles, the Blank, Pruneface, Spud. Chester Gould gave the names to his characters that fit their profiles, and gave his hero a jaw that could cut glass. The film is a continuation of sight gags that are perfectly taken seriously.If, at the time, movies like Batman and (underrated) Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles were darker depictions of reality within a comic-book outline, Dick Tracy is more 'old-school'. It's a story of cops and crooks, or rather A cop, detective Tracy as he tries to bust Big Boy (Al Pacino, in what is arguably his BIGGEST performance to date, and in a sense the one that makes sense for his grandiose style), but with no such luck. There's also a little kid, called simply the Kid (Charlie Korsmo, who somehow brings more spunk to this little kid than would've been imagined), and Tracy's love interest in Tess. And then there's the nightclub 'dame' (Madonna, who probably doesn't give any kind of great acting performance, but maybe that suits the role fine, and she sings excellently when called upon), who wont testify unless Tracy admits feelings he doesn't have for her. Then there's convoluted dealings with taking Tracy down, and a mysterious masked figure with a scraggly voice.Meantime, as if doing an impersonation of a Howard Hawks film in a splash of visual effects and bigger explosions, Dick Tracy adds on the wink-and-nod comedy and the action like its syrup on a tall stack of pancakes. It's a wonder to look at this world, which is created in ways that have a fascination to them that had they been done today would just be simply by proxy of computers (i.e. Sin City, which can be justifiably compared to Beatty's film). We're driven through this world in great big shots and then thrust in the plot line, or whatever there is of it, in big editing montages with camera angles that seem to come out of those little tilted panels in the comics of old. I'm almost reminded of the Cotton Club during these sequences, as story, music, detail, and a few BIG punches and gun-shots go a long way to revealing what needs to be said, which, actually, isn't more than it needs to. And there's a heap-load of catchy dialog from the script (one of my favorites: ""the enemy of my enemy is... my enemy"", plus any of Pacino's references to other figures in quotes).Revisiting this after seeing it for the first time in the movie theater (and only remembering little bits), Dick Tracy is a hard-boiled fantasy to the finest degree. It's filled with good cheer for the kids, and with some pretty good action squared away without some of the more sinister intent of its cousin comic-book movies (i.e. PG-13 fare), and for the adults its throw-back central done with panache and a solid feeling for the unsubtle. Even Dustin Hoffman hams it up, and he barely says an audible word!",Dick Tracy
13,wes-connors,"Make-Up, Color and Madonna",5,4 April 2014,"While at the opera, squared-jawed detective Dick Tracy (Warren Beatty) answers a call on his wrist-radio. He's informed about the opening massacre, orchestrated by the city's leading mobster, Alphonse ""Big Boy"" Caprice (Al Pacino). Bullets spell out the message ""Eat Lead Tracy"" at the crime scene. This is obviously a call to action. Witnessing the event is a homeless and hungry orphan known only as ""The Kid"" (Charlie Korsmo), soon to be Tracy's sidekick. Clad in his trademark yellow raincoat and cap, Tracy tries to maintain law and order in the city. Meanwhile, alluring singer Madonna (as Patricia ""Breathless"" Mahoney) tried to seduce Tracy, threatening his relationship with traditional sweetheart Tess Trueheart (Glenne Headly)...Madonna wears arousing, slit dresses and sings new songs, written for the film by Stephen Sondheim. The more successful songs on Madonna's soundtrack album ""I'm Breathless"" (like ""Vogue"") are not heard in the film. She's quite an attraction, but she's always Madonna. Cartoonist Chester Gould's famous character looks convincingly like Mr. Beatty, who also directed. He has a great production team and the film is beautifully shot; it has a stylish, comic strip color scheme. Make-up recreates the ""funnies"" characters to a degree; my favorite was ""Flattop"" (William Forsythe). However, all the expense can't disguise the fact that there really isn't anything very spectacular going on in the story. For looking good, ""Dick Tracy"" won several film awards.***** Dick Tracy (6/14/90) Warren Beatty ~ Warren Beatty, Madonna, Al Pacino, Glenne Headly",Dick Tracy
14,BandSAboutMovies,A great attempt,7,20 April 2020,"Warren Beatty wanted to make this movie all the way back in 1975. In 1980, United Artists became interested in financing and distributing the movie, getting James Bond and Superman writer Tom Mankiewicz to start the script. However, the deal fell through when Chester Gould, creator of the comic strip, pushed for a heavy hand in financial and creative matters.Spielberg and John Landis were considered to direct at one point at Universal, with Clint Eastwood, Harrison Ford, Richard Gere, Tom Selleck and Mel Gibson all considered for the starring role.After the incident on the set of The Twilight Zone: The Movie, Landis left the project and Walter Hill came on with Joel Silver producing. They approached Beatty to be the star. Sets were even built, but Beatty had creative issues with Hill, who wanted a violent and realistic film. However, the star was a big fan of the comic strip and wanted a stylized version of a comic book, plus a $5 million dollar salary and 15% of the gross.Beatty finally got a deal with Disney that enabled him to produce, direct and star in the film. Disney greenlit Dick Tracy in 1988 with the rules that Beatty - who was notorious for going overbudget - stay within a $25 million dollar budget.That didn't happen, as once filming started, costs went up to $46.5 million and an additional $48.1 million in advertising. The movie made back $162.7 million, so it did make back the investment.This is one of the last American blockbusters to use no CGI. Instead, the design team of production designer Richard Sylbert, set decorator Rick Simpson, cinematographer Vittorio Storaro, visual effects supervisors Michael Lloyd and Harrison Ellenshaw, prosthetic makeup designers John Caglione, Jr. and Doug Drexler, and costume designer Milena Canonero used a combination of matte paintings and incredibly detailed makeup. They also limited themselves to just seven colors and never move the camera. Everything is in frame, as if it's a comic book panel. Plus, it features some of the most elaborate scene paintings ever made.That said - it's the first movie to use digital audio.As for the film itself, it's nearly a spot the actor game just as much as it is a story. Tracy (Beatty) is up against ""Big Boy"" Caprice (Al Pacino), a crime boss who our hero has been after for years, as well as an army of all of Tracy's bad guys from the strip.Plus, there's Breathless Mahoney (Madonna), who keeps coming between Tracy and his true love, the unironically named Tess Trueheart. Oh yeah - and then there's The Kid, a child who no one wants and that Tracy starts taking care of.If you love character actors, this movie is for you. There' Seymour Cassel as Sam Catchem, Michael J. Pollard as Big Bailey, Charles Durning as the chief, Dick Van Dyke as the district attorney and even Kathy Bates as a court stenographer. Even Mary Woronov shows up as a child welfare agent!The bad guys are Dustin Hoffman as Mumbles, William Forsythe as Flattop, Ed O'Ross as Itchy, Mandy Patinkin as 88 Keys, James Tolkan as Numbers, Henry Silva as Influence, Paul Sorvino as Lips Manlis, R.G. Armstrong as Pruneface, James Caan as Spud Spaldoni and there are quite literally so many other bad guys that I've forgotten over the years that Catherine O'Hara plays Texie Garcia.There's also The Blank, a mysterious villain who looks like something right out of Blood and Black Lace.Disney had hoped that Dick Tracy would become a successful franchise, but its disappointing box office performance halted those plans. It made money - but not enough money for the effort.As these things happen, lawsuits followed. Executive producers Art Linson and Floyd Mutrux sued Beatty shortly after the release of the film, as they claimed that they were owed profit participation.Beatty was the person who had actually purchased the Dick Tracy film and television rights in 1985 from Tribune Media Services before taking the project to Disney. According to Beatty, in 2002, Tribune attempted to reclaim the rights and notified Disney. They just never told him or followed their agreement.To lock up the rights even further, Beatty hired cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki and film critic Leonard Maltin to make the 2008 Dick Tracy TV Special for Turner Classic Movies. This bonkers effort features Beatty as Tracy in a retrospective interview with Maltin. That's right - Beatty is in character for the entire special. When asked if Beatty will make a sequel, Dick Tracy tells Maltin to ask him himself.Even stranger, this special has only aired once, as if it were a legal announcement. Well, that's because it was.I love this movie. It's completely unlike any other film ever made and just looks so strange as a result. Beatty is also crazy - this has been confirmed by many people who worked on this, like Danny Elfman - but the results are so good.",Dick Tracy
15,Coventry,Crazy colors and mad villains; - the Comic book adaptation that hits you in the face like a light pole!,8,9 July 2019,"The other day I went to the cinema with my 9-year-old son, to watch another one of those never-ending ""Avengers"" movies, and my melancholic and old-fashioned mind kept drifting off to the times when I was that same age and also became engulfed with the comic book film-adaptations of that era. Surely my son and his entire generation would disagree, but the old comic book films were so much darker and more imaginative! ""Dick Tracy"", but also other contemporary classics like ""The Punisher"" or Tim Burton's ""Batman"", were extremely violent and hardly even meant for children's eyes, but they genuinely brought the raw and unhinged atmosphere of the comic strips much more to life than the uninspired nowadays blockbusters.""Dick Tracy"" is an utterly bonkers and tremendously entertaining movie, largely because director/protagonist Warren Beatty so obviously is a giant fan himself, and thus he insisted on turning the film into an exact replica of the comic as much as possible, with the wonderfully ingenious use of bright colors and the inclusion of practically every exaggeratedly eccentric villain that ever appeared in creator Chester Gould's wicked imagination. For people like me, this film is like a dream come true because I'm always a lot more fascinated by, and rooting for, the villainous characters rather than the heroic ones. Beatty puts his own Tracy character almost literally in the shadows in order to give podium to all the wondrously flamboyant gangsters, who often have names inspired by physical particularities, like Flattop, Pruneface or The Brow. Set in the 1930's, Chicago is in grave danger when the megalomaniac Big Boy Caprice grabs control of the city and pleas to form a gangster-alliance against Tracy. And, whilst the sensual night club singer and reluctant crime mistress Breathless Mahoney puts pressure on Tracy's relationship with Tess Trueheart, another mysterious foe - aptly referred to as The Blank - enters the stage, and he seems to be after bringing down both Tracy and Big Boy.What a fun film! What awesome performances! So many fantastic actors are practically unrecognizable in their roles, but they are visibly enjoying themselves a lot. Al Pacino is downright awesome as Big Boy, dumbly misquoting Nietsche and Plato but considering himself the smartest gangster in Chicago history. Equally splendid, albeit smaller, roles are made legendary by stars like William Forsyth (Flattop), Henry Silva (Influence), Ed O'Ross (Itchy) and Dustin Hoffman (Mumbles). Heck, even Madonna gives a stellar performance! The script throws all unnecessary complexity overboard and purely aims at solid entertainment, with lots of action throughout the film and a very explosive finale. The editing is razor sharp, Danny Elfman is obviously the ideal composer to provide the film with a gloomy soundtrack and the colors are indescribably exquisite! It would take another fifteen years, with Robert Rodrigues' ""Sin City"" in 20015, before there came another dark and grim comic adaptation.PS: the ""hits you in the face like a light pole"" in the review's subject line refers to a stunt that Warren Beatty did himself, when he jumps from a rooftop onto a light pole and, undoubtedly painfully, hits his face against the steel pole. Beatty's little miscalculation is clearly visible but nevertheless made the final cut. Respect!",Dick Tracy
16,michaelRokeefe,Classic comic strip character comes to the cinema.,5,26 April 2000,"Warren Beatty brings our favorite comic strip cop to the screen like no one before him. The vivid colors used gives it a cartoonish look that is fun to look at. Plus the hokey acting from some pretty big name stars is second only to guessing who the stars are under the heavy makeup. The plot is short of a disaster. The background score is fantastic. On a whole, the movie is take it or leave it.Beatty plays Tracy as stiff as a comic strip cop. Madonna is great to look at, but the songs are way below her standard. A few of the big names hardly recognized under the makeup are Al Pacino, Dustin Hoffman, James Caan, Charles Durning, Kathy Bates and William Forsythe. Charlie Korsmo is smart as a whip in the part of ""Kid"". Rent for the kids and check in once in a while. It's fun!",Dick Tracy
17,hitchcockthelegend,A bit too mellow yellow.,7,13 March 2014,"Dick Tracy is directed by Warren Beatty and written by Jim Cash and Jack Epps Jr. Based on Chester Gould's comic strip creation of the same name, it stars Beatty, Al Pacino, Madonna, Glenne Headly, Dustin Hoffman, Charlie Korsmo, Charles Durning and William Forsythe. Music is by Danny Elfman, with songs by Stephen Sondheim, and cinematography is by Vittorio Storaro.Punk Rock band X-Ray Spex once sang about The Day The World Turned Day- Glo, Warren Beatty's Dick Tracy was exactly that. The live action cartoon is a feast for the eyes, as the city backdrop for this cops and gangsters tale is a fountain of bright, lurid primary colours. The characters are drawn brilliantly, where the good guys are very much human, but the bad guys are a bunch of grotesques, like a mutant gathering under one coalition banner. All star casting, striking costuming, amazing effects work, quality songs and a brisk musical score (Elfman reworks his score for Batman from the previous year), Dick Tracy as a production is grade ""A"" stuff. It also did very well at the box office, where although it didn't reach Disney's expectation levels financially, it coined to the tune of over $100 million in profit Worldwide. Not bad for a film some still think was a flop!It's a film that feels a lot better watching it now than it did back on release, to be able to view it as a smart technical accomplishment for the time it was made. The cast factor also makes it something of a fascinating experience, watching legends like Pacino and Hoffman absolutely buy into the cartoon excess on show. However, the old problem with it just will never go away. Yes the plot is very simple, but that's easy to accept these days, it was after all a gangster movie made for all the family, it's that Beatty's portrayal of Tracy is too under played. He's a good guy, we know that, we are on his side, but it's a flat characterisation, he's never pushed to be anything other than a cool dude. This of course lets the monstrous villains take the film by the scruff of the neck, as most villains tend to anyway, but for a film carrying his name, you expect a bit more from Dick Tracy the man.Still, Dick Tracy is a fun movie experience, not all it can be, but enjoyable regardless. 7/10",Dick Tracy
18,preppy-3,Not deserving the obscurity it has,7,7 June 2003,"This came out with big fanfare in 1990---and disappeared without a trace. That's too bad...it's no masterpiece but it's not a disaster either.The plot is simple--Dick Tracys' (Warren Beatty) vast array of enemies all gang up under Big Boy Caprice (Al Pacino) to kill Tracy and take over the city. Along for the ride is Breathless Mahoney (Madonna) who loves Tracy. And whose side is the mysterious Blank on?The story is very simple (but then Tracy IS a comic strip) but that doesn't really matter. There are stunning sets and incredible art direction (an Academy Award winner). Everything looks like a comic book mixed with live action and filmed in blazing primary colors (red, blue, green, yellow). There's so much to look at you can forgive the simplistic plot.Sadly there are other problems. Way too many villains--they try and fit in all of Tracys' villains from the comic strip. There are too many and it amounts to overkill. Beatty is pretty bad as Tracy--stonefaced and not projecting any emotion or feeling--not good. Madonna is--of course--terrible as Breathless (but she DOES look good in those dresses and really belts out the songs). There are many great actors buried under tons of grotesque makeup (another Academy Award winner) giving their worst performances. I don't blame them--who can act with tons of makeup on your face?But there are still plenty of good things--a great, bombastic score by Danny Elfman perfectly fitting the settings; Glenne Headly gives a very good performance as Tess Trueheart; Al Pacino goes WAY over the top (and is hysterically funny) as Big Boy; there's the Academy Award winning Best Song (I Always Get My Man) and, again, the stunning settings.This is not a faithful adaptation of the comic strip--the comic strip was very violent and occasionally banned because of it. This is a family friendly version of it. The shootings are all bloodless and quick.It's hard to understand why this bombed and disappeared so quickly. Maybe it will be rediscovered someday.No great shakes but worth seeing.",Dick Tracy
19,LeonLouisRicci,Wow!!!!,10,20 February 2013,"In the Medium we call Film there is often a lack of Visual Vitality. A Look that is Subservient to the Components that Coalesce to become the Art-Form. Most times, at its best, these are brought Together in a Production using Costumes, Music, Acting, Cinematography, Makeup, and Script all Firing Together and the Movie Hums like a well Tuned Engine.Sometimes one or more of these Components can be so Overwhelming and alone can Create something that is a Stylizing of Subject. Such is the Off Center Appeal of Dick Tracy. The Template, Never Seen before, of Garish Primary Colors and Surreal Backdrops are Displayed to give this Experiment a Wow inducing Experience.There isn't much beneath all this Excitement and the Plot, what there is, moves slowly and without Fanfare other than to be a Slim Thread to hold this Incredible Tapestry together. The Dialog, Songs, and Story are acceptable, if not remarkable, but it is the Eye-Filling Look that one Remembers and it truly is Unforgettable. It's a singular style that has such Seductive Appeal on a Luscious Two-Dimensional Spread.That is more than enough to make this a Triumph of Movie Magic and to this Day is a Wonder to behold and is a Singular Creation of Interest. A Link between Comic-Strip and Celluloid that is Astonishing and Under-Appreciated, and has been Overlooked.",Dick Tracy
20,utgard14,Beautiful,8,11 November 2013,"Labor of love for star and director Warren Beatty, Dick Tracy was a film I hated when it first came out. I was a kid and stupid, only caring about what's cool. What was cool then (and sadly still is) was ""dark and gritty"" heroes like Batman. Dick Tracy was considered corny and lame. When I first watched it I thought it was a kids' movie and I was at that age where anything like that I hated. Happily, I feel much differently about the film now that I'm older.Dick Tracy is a live-action cartoon, with eye-popping visuals decked out in bright primary colors. It's a beautiful film to behold. Everyone involved in the stylized look of this movie should be proud. The sets, the lighting, the matte paintings, the makeup and effects are all superior to any CGI crap we get today. Real work and passion went into this and it shows.The cast is great. Beatty is criticized by many for not being the right fit for Tracy or for being too old. While he's not a perfect representation of the character, I feel he does quite well and his age never occurred to me while watching it. Madonna gives easily her best performance in this movie. That's meant slightly as a slam I guess, as most of her other work is very weak. But it's also meant as a compliment. Here she plays to her strengths: sex appeal and ""oomph."" Her double entendres and skin-tight dresses make Breathless Mahoney a very memorable character. There's also some fine support from Glenne Headley and Charlie Korsmo. And who can forget the villains! Chester Gould's distinctive-looking villains come to life thanks to superb makeup, played in many cases by uncredited stars. The leader of the bunch is Big Boy Caprice, played by the wonderfully over-the-top Al Pacino. Pacino was having a lot of fun with the role and it shows.My only real complaint lies in the music. Not the Stephen Sondheim songs -- they're great. But the Danny Elfman musical score is way too similar to the one he did for Batman the year before. It's very lazy and doesn't seem to fit the action of the film. Forget what you've read from naysayers about this movie and judge it for yourself. It's a fun movie with exceptional visuals and colorful ambiance.",Dick Tracy
21,view_and_review,Vibrant but Hollow,6,21 February 2020,"I don't want to say that this movie was a waste of talent because it could be the talent that made it even watchable. I liked the cast, the set, the vibrancy of the colors, and even the music, but with all that I was only mildly fond of ""Dick Tracy."" I think the story wasn't quite captivating enough and Madonna, besides being the pretty face, added nothing to the movie. It was almost like she was there for Dick Tracy to be caught in a love triangle. ""Dick Tracy"" gets high marks for all the glamor and glitz, but low marks for actual substance.",Dick Tracy
22,evanston_dad,A Big Fat Dud,5,17 October 2008,"""Dick Tracy"" is an example of what happens to a movie when it's over produced and over marketed. At the time of its release, it was touted as THE big movie of the year, and it built up expectations it couldn't possibly meet. Granted, it's not a very good movie anyway, so even with lower expectations it still would likely have bombed, but I think it seemed worse than it was because people were expecting so much.The production and costume design are fun, mimicking the look and style of the comic book series. Nothing else is notable, least of all the acting, which with a cast that includes Warren Beatty and Al Pacino, should tell you something right there. They should have taken the money they spent on sets and cameos for big stars and hired better writers.Grade: C",Dick Tracy
23,AlsExGal,I wasn't overly impressed,6,23 November 2019,"I think Warren does a good job of portraying the iconic serial detective, and Charlie Korsmo is certainly endearing as ""The Kid."" It took me a little while (I embarrassingly admit) to realize the character of Big Boy Caprice was played by Mr. Pacino, and almost no time at all to realize that the ""Mumbles"" character was played by Mr. Hoffman.I enjoyed all the bright colors and some oversized props (reminds me a little bit of the whole aesthetic of ""Who Framed Roger Rabbit..."") Decent enough, although Madonna's attempt at nightclub singing really got on my nerves throughout the film, but alas , this is where Warren went wrong.Warren did ALMOST everything right, in the look, his performance, the casting, the visual over-the-top stylizing for the sake of iconography, and the square jawed 30's comic sensibility, and even sticking his Ishtar buddy Hoffman in for a bit part. But then he had to turn into Director Warren Beatty, who rarely creates an action sequence when an artistic musical montage would carry the scene along so much better...I remember we were all led in by comic-strip action scenes in the trailer, only to find out that those scenes would all be covered over by a slow Madonna torch song. To top it all off the film requires Madonna to ACT, not just throw out one liners like she did in ""A League of Their Own"".",Dick Tracy
24,Uriah43,Outstanding Special Effects and Makeup,5,30 September 2018,"This movie essentially begins with a crime boss named ""Alphonse 'Big Boy' Caprice"" (Al Pacino) deciding to ruthlessly take over all of the underworld operations within the city by killing off all those who oppose him. Needless to say, this puts him and a detective by the name of ""Dick Tracy"" (Warren Beatty) on an immediate collision course with both using all of the tools at their disposal to accomplish their assorted objectives. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that I really liked the special effects and makeup which captured the comic strip environment in an exceptional manner. To that extent, it managed to win an Academy Award in that category. Likewise, I also enjoyed the the performance of Al Pacino who was nominated for an Academy Award as well. On the minus side, the action and plot seemed to drag here and there which seemed to lessen the overall effect to a certain degree. That being said, while it definitely had some potential, I cannot honestly rate it any higher than I have. Average.",Dick Tracy
25,morrison-dylan-fan,Warren Beatty's adaptation of Chester Gould's Dick Tracy.,7,2 April 2014,"After staying away from looking at the movie for a number of years,due to always hearing a lot of negative reactions towards the title,I was recently caught by surprise,when I read a wonderful review by a fellow IMDb'er that made the film sound much more stylish than I had expected it to be,which led to me getting ready to finally meet Dick Tracy.
View on the film:Reuniting with cinematography Vittorio Storaro, (who had earlier joined him for 1987's Reds) lead actor/director Warren Beatty firmly places Tracy in an eye dazzling,comic-book world.Staying away from any bleak colours,Beatty and Storaro splash the film in primary colours,which along with giving all of the characters a very animated appearance,also soaks the title in a wonderfully brittle pulp atmosphere.Packing the rouge's gallery with an amazing number of familiar faces,each of the lead baddies display a clear joy in their performances,with Al Pacino biting everyone's head off as delightful boo-hiss villain Big Boy Caprice,and Dick Van Dyke shows himself to be a less than clean DA.Despite every film that she now appears in largely getting trashed,Madonna, (who its alleged is one of the few Hollywood actresses that had a romantic relationship with Beatty) gives a very good performance as Breathless Mahoney,as Madonna shows Mahoney to be a dame whose more than happy to push either Caprice and Tracy to the side.Taking on the title role,Beatty gives a strong,lively performance as Tracy,with Beatty showing Tracy to be a cop who has one eye on the rulebook,and one eye on getting a grip on Caprice via means that are 'slightly' outside the law.Sadly the screenplay by Jim Cash and Jack Epps Jr. is never quite able to match the stylishness displayed in Beatty directing.Being partly damaged by the studio ordering Beatty to cut the movie down from his preferred 135 minute cut of the title,the writers never allow Tracy's battles with the baddies and his growing relationship with 'The Kid' to fully intertwine,which leads to the pace of the movie feeling rather uneven,as the screenplay fails to match Beatty's dazzlingly drawn pop-art Comic-Book.",Dick Tracy
26,HotToastyRag,Incredible makeup,5,31 January 2019,"If you know and have read the Dick Tracy comics from the 1930s, you're obviously going to want to watch the 1990 film adaptation. Warren Beatty stars as the titular detective, and he also produced and directed the film, and it's clear he settled for nothing less than stellar for his baby. The colors, camera angles, and heavily made up supporting cast saturate the audience in the noir comic book world.With Dustin Hoffman, William Forsythe, R.G. Armstrong, Lawrence Steven Myers, Stig Eldred, Chuck Hicks, Neil Summers, Jim Wilkey, Paul Sorvino, and Al Pacino all heavily made up to look like their comic book counterparts, you're in for a visual treat, even if you don't normally like comic book movies or noir dramas. Dick Tracy won Best Makeup at the 1991 Oscar ceremony, and it was well-deserved. Madonna plays a nightclub singer and Warren Beatty's love interest, both of which were hardly a stretch for her acting capabilities. Even if you're not a fan of her, which I'm not, she won't really ruin the movie for you. Just focus on everyone else in the movie, and there are so many others to focus on.",Dick Tracy

28,Wuchakk,"Great look and cast (and DANCERS), but mediocre story",6,31 August 2016,"Released in 1990 and directed by Warren Beatty, ""Dick Tracy"" is a crime/action/drama based on the comic strip by Chester Gould with Beatty in the eponymous role. Al Pacino and Madonna co-star as Big Boy Caprice and Breathless Mahoney respectively. Glenne Headly is on hand as Tracy's babe, Tess, while Charlie Korsmo plays ""Kid,"" a homeless boy Dick & Tess unofficially adopt.Gould wrote & drew the strip from 1931-1977 and others have taken over since then, but I've never read it; although I've given it a quick glance in the paper now and then. As such, I'm not the best person to appraise the quality of this movie. But it has a great LOOK, like it's the comic strip come to life. I hear they only used seven colors for the sets, costuming, props and F/X.The cast is good, even the heavily-panned Madonna, and I did care about Dick & Tess and their relationship, and Kid too, even though he was obnoxious at first. Breathless Mahoney's dancers are one of the highlights; great job on this front.Unfortunately, the story was only so-so compelling. It amazes me how blockbuster filmmakers will blow all this money to get the ""look"" of the film perfect and then drop the ball on the most important element – the STORY. That said, it's serviceable and the revelation about The Blank at the end caught me by surprise (aduh).FINAL SAY: I liked ""Dick Tracy"" just enough to give it a marginal recommendation due to the highlights noted above. It struck me as a combination of 1984's ""The Cotton Club"" and 1989's ""Batman""; so, if you like those films, you'll probably appreciate this one.The movie runs 105 minutes and was shot at Universal Studios, Los Angeles.GRADE: B-",Dick Tracy
29,mm-39,This movie is like week old stale bread,3,28 July 2002,"This film is stale, and misses the mark.  It is far off compared to the 89 Batman that it tries to coppy.  That women singer whats her name can not act, and we see why her film carrier died.  Notice how this film died in the box office no one see this film on tv either.

30,Mr-Fusion,Might be the quintessential comic book movie,7,5 February 2015,"""Dick Tracy"" holds up surprisingly well. And just to get the negative out of the way . . . Ugh, Madonna is awful. Her half-assed line deliveries drag every one of her scenes. In all fairness, I'm not a Sondheim guy, so the songs aren't my cup of tea, either (same problem I had with ""Sweeney Todd""), but it's astounding how dead weight she is.But in spite of that burden, the movie stands as a love letter to the comic strip medium and the period; the artful shot compositions, the gorgeous matte paintings, and my god the chroma saturation. This thing's a visual feast. Warren Beatty created a pretty cool world to visit, populated with coppers, hoods, fedoras, Tommy guns and flying fists. It's simplistic, but that's it's charm. And a lot of love went into this. It brings back memories of that Summer in 1990 with the marketing-as-pop-art campaign, and it's totally Disney's grab at ""Batman"" levels of success (even nabbing Danny Elfman, although his score is a high point).

Also, the performances, are very impressive!Based on the 1930s comic strip character of the same name created by Chester Gould, 'Dick Tracy' depicts the detective's love relationships with Breathless Mahoney and Tess Truehart, as well as his conflicts with crime boss Alphonse ""Big Boy"" Caprice. Tracy also begins his upbringing of ""The Kid"".Warren Beatty has made a very ambitious film in 'Dick Tracy'. Right from Production, Direction, Performance & Execution, in each of these departments, Beatty's undying love for this film, reflects very sharply. Even though flawed & slightly lazy, Beatty succeeds by making an entertaining & eventful film, that will definitely appeal to the youth, to this day. Performance-Wise: As mentioned, Beatty's dedication reflects in all the departments he puts himself into, and as Dick Tracy, Beatty comes across as energetic & likable. Al Pacino is mesmerizing as crime boss Alphonse ""Big Boy"" Caprice. Madonna is good. Glenne Headly is sincere, while Charlie Korsmo is supremely confident. Among the supporting cast, Dustin Hoffman & Charles Durning are noticeable. On the whole, 'Dick Tracy' isn't great, but entertaining nonetheless.",Dick Tracy
32,Smells_Like_Cheese,"With Dick Tracey, you're always wanting ""more""",7,11 May 2012,"When I was a kid, one of the big movies was Dick Tracey. I remember watching this movie all the time on TV and was just in love with it. I wanted to be Madonna because of this film. The colors were bright, the villains were terrifying to look at and the story was very cool. We couldn't get enough of the movie, comic book, cartoon or video game. Dick Tracey was the man of the early 90's. The weird thing is I never wrote a comment on the movie because when I first started writing reviews when I was 15 yeas old was because I didn't see the movie for years and it would've been unfair to give it a review without being able to remember what it really was. I bought the film a year ago when I found it in a five dollar bin flashing back to the good ol' days. I watched the film tonite wanting to be taken back to what was so magical about this movie when I was a kid and found myself criticizing it like an adult instead.At an illegal card game, a young street kid witnesses the massacre of a group of mobsters at the hands of Flattop and Itchy, two of the hoods on the payroll of Alphonse ""Big Boy"" Caprice. Big Boy's crime syndicate is aggressively taking over small businesses in the city. Detective Dick Tracy catches the kid in an act of petty theft. After rescuing him from a ruthless host, Tracy temporarily adopts him with the help of his girlfriend, Tess Truehart. Meanwhile, Big Boy coerces club owner Lips Manlis into signing over the deed to Club Ritz. He then kills Lips with a cement overcoat and steals his girlfriend, Breathless Mahoney. After Lips is reported missing, Tracy interrogates his three hired guns, Flattop, Itchy, and Mumbles, then goes to the club to arrest Big Boy for Lips' murder. Breathless is the only witness and Tracey needs her to testify in order to put Big Boy in prison once and for all.Funny thing that this being a film that all my friends and I remember watching as kids and really in some strange way this has more adult themes to it. For God's sake we see Madonna's nipple in a sheer outfit, all though I don't think there were men in this country who didn't see her bosoms. The villain's make up was actually frightening in some aspects and I remember as a kid the ""no face"" villain scared me very much. But as kids we are more resilient than adults gave us credit for. For the film, it's still very colorful and I really admire it for that. The colors are red, yellow, green, red and black and you feel like you're transferred into the comics.You can tell that Warren had a genuine love for this movie and the comics. He really captures what a comic book movie is. I also loved the whole feeling of the classic gangsters story with the tommy guns and wardrobe. I think over all the film works on the story and the actors really got into it. Though I think it could've been bigger like Batman. I don't know what it was that didn't get this film into a better status when you think of good comic book movies, maybe there were things that were off that Warren couldn't capture. Dick Tracey is an interesting character that could be explored more and given better depth. But this movie is still very fun and holds up well to this day. With fun visuals and a great cast, Dick Tracey is still the man.7/10",Dick Tracy
33,MovieAddict2016,One of the best comic book adaptations of all time.,10,6 December 2004,"I've been watching ""Dick Tracy"" for years, and as a result it's become a vital part of my life - it was with me throughout childhood and I used to see it quite often. Seeing it now, as an adult, it's still a very good movie - dark, satiric and incredibly misunderstood. About the only thing that can be said is the Oscar nomination Pacino received - other than that it is rarely discussed and didn't make much of a fuss when it came out.Pacino is over-the-top but to good effect as he's clearly having loads of fun. Beatty is great as Dick Tracy and behind the camera manages to capture the atmosphere of a film noir comic book better than any other film, possibly, I have ever seen. Just taking a look at one scene from the film is breathtaking. The lighting, velvet overtones and smog/smoke combine to create a great effect.There are some really funny cameos including one by Dustin Hoffman as ""Mumbles,"" and I don't think there are any flaws at all in terms of acting - even the mandatory kid-character is far better than expected.Overall, a really fine movie that has become misunderstood over the years since its release and is incredibly underrated with only 5.7/10 average on IMDb. The critics' reviews are very positive (check out RottenTomatoes.com) and after seeing the film once again it's not hard to see why - this is a perfect example of capturing the essence of a comic book, from style to eccentricity.Highly recommended. 4.5/5 stars.",Dick Tracy
34,lasttimeisaw,Dick Tracy,6,13 December 2011,"Dick Tracy, is a territory I'm unfamiliar with (never heard of the comic strip before), Warren Beatty, is a mysterious Hollywood honcho whom I reckon to be a legend whose fame is unceasing even though his last work TOWN & COUNTRY (2001) is a notorious catastrophe which is a perfect paradigm of failure in Hollywood film history and had prompted his retirement until now, rumor says a new film project is in development right now and aiming for a 2013 release, finger crossed!This profusely comic-influenced film is a hybrid of stylistic settings and costumes and stylized performances, dangling with a feeble script. Woefully Beatty, Pacino and Hoffman, 3 bigwigs emerging in a single film and the spark is scarce, Madonna conspicuously proves that acting is not her strong suit, while the music in it is marvelously diverting and intriguing. Then comes the Oscar winning and nominations, 3 won for Art Direction, Make-up and Original song, all are meriting, another 4 nominations, Cinematography, Costume Design, Sound and Pacino's Supporting actor, I can merely understand the first three (not a technical connoisseur myself), for me the last one just manifests at that time the Academy did whatever they could to compensate Pacino's Oscar-less status then (thanks to the belated SCENT OF A WOMAN in 1992, otherwise, maybe he would get a nomination even for Gigli in 2003). It could be a breakthrough for Pacino to star as the villain in a farce feature, but that is all, it's impossible to bare the label of ""best of the year"".With all due respect to all the devotees, but a cartoon-prone tune within the vintage 1930s could not help to establish this film a rightful public praise (although it is a box office victor). Nonetheless the film is not less than entertaining, but among Beatty's admirable filmography, DICK TRACY's right position is a respectful trifle (maybe better than TOWN & COUNTRY, LOVE AFFAIR 1994 and Ishtar 1987).",Dick Tracy
35,cricketbat,"Stylistically, this film is fantastic",8,23 November 2018,"For as popular as Dick Tracy was back when it was released, it's strange that it's so forgotten now. Stylistically, this film is fantastic. The simplified color palette makes it feel just like a comic strip and the subtle (and not so subtle) make-up effects make the star-studded cast almost unrecognizable. However, the story feels a little flat and the acting is a bit over the top. It hasn't aged as well as other films, but this definitely belongs in the canon of well-made comic book movies.",Dick Tracy
36,CuriosityKilledShawn,Colorful and entertaining but mindless,6,4 September 2004,"I'm not the biggest fan of Dick Tracy and outside of this movie I couldn't tell you anything about him other than he's an honest cop who favors yellow and he's been around for a long time. Comic-book movies are a dime a dozen these days so maybe now Dick Tracy doesn't stand out as much as it did in 1990, a shame because Warren Beatty's color scheme and attention to detail is quite impressive. And the film did win 2 Academy Awards for the art direction and the gruesome make-up. I think Disney were shooting for a successful franchise in the vein of Burton's Batman the previous year. The films are very similar visually and it's a shame we never got more Dick Tracy movies.The plot is nonsense, some Gangster called 'Big Boy Caprice (played by an over-the-top Al Pacino in such eccentric make-up it actually looks like Antoine de Caunes playing Al Pacino playing Big Boy) wants to take control of 'the city' and Dick Tracy does his best to take him down. Madonna pops up as a floozy and the wretched kid who played Peter Pan's son in Hook pops up as...um...'The Kid'. Amidst these unremarkable plot developments dozens of grotesque gangsters bicker and mumble and fill up the running time. It's not so much fun following the plot as it is keeping your eyes open for all the actors hidden underneath the make-up. Such as William Forsythe, Ed O'Ross, Paul Sorvino, RG Armstrong and Dustin Hoffman, who is hilarious as Mumbles. It really makes you think about how successful actors can be identified by their unique voices or by their eyes.Some of it is rather dull but there are moments of spectacle that make it worthwhile. The matte paintings and color schemes are truly wonderful, turning the movie into a modern day film noir. Danny Elfman however, cranks out YET ANOTHER generic, lifeless comic-book movie score that brings no life of it's own the images on screen. He's truly my least favorite film composer (tying with Randy Edelman). But it did win another Academy Award for 'Best Original Song' as well as being nominated for 4 others.There have been rumors for years that Beatty's cut of the film was 135 minutes long and that Disney demanded that he cut it down to 105. This seems to make sense regarding some unusual edits in certain scenes and the fact that all of a sudden the movie is set on New Year's Eve during the climax despite the fact that it is clearly not winter nor is there any mention of Xmas (much like Ghostbusters II).Disney seem to hate the movie, despite its success, and I'm not surprised considering the massive legal trouble it brought them with various rights disputes over the years, which is why there was never any sequel. Beatty still retains the rights and promises that there WILL be another Dick Tracy, but the dude was born in 1937. He can't play Dick Tracy anymore unless the movie will be set in the 1960s.",Dick Tracy
37,ironhorse_iv,"This dick movie is very limp. It's alright, but could had been bigger & better. It's need more balls.",6,11 January 2015,"Calling Dick Tracy, a bad movie is an overstatement. As a kid of the 1990s, it was alright for the most part as a comic book film noir movie. Directed by Warren Beatty, and produced by Disney under their Touchstone Pictures banner, the movie, adapted the Chester Gould's relatively simple crime-drama comic strip and reimagined it as a complex big-budget extravaganza with big-name actors, colorful costumes, special effects and plenty of music. The movie tells the story of Detective Dick Tracy (Warren Beatty) who must save his beloved city, from up-and-coming gang boss in Big Boy Caprice (Al Pacino) who unites all Dick Tracy's rivals into a citywide gangland coalition. Now Tracy's only hope in foiling Big Boy's schemes lies with nightclub singer Breathless Mahoney (Madonna), who is prepared to help the detective for a price that Tracy cannot delivered. Can Dick Tracy take down Big Boy Caprice's united mob or will Dick Tracy, be swimming with the fishes, by the end? Watch it to find out. Without spoiling too much of the film. The film feels like a rip-off of 1989's Batman in its look, music, and plot. If that wasn't all, the movie story is not the greatest. It felt like a series of comic strips, put into one. It often felt very disjointed and things move in a nearly out of place motion. It gets ready confusing. A lot of things don't make sense like the twist toward the end. The story is often riddled with huge plot-holes as if shot with a tommy gun. The movie pacing move as fast as paint dries with music acts, action and exposition scenes that wasn't really needed. It's snail pace. Most of the main performances seem dull and phoned in. Supporting actors like Dustin Hoffman as Mumbles, and Dick Van Dyle as the D.A get way under-looked. It was just a huge mess. Warren Beatty as Dick Tracy is mediocre. One of the biggest problems is that Dick Tracy just isn't an interesting character. Warren Beatty certainly doesn't put much effort into making him a compelling character. It was one of his last big main roles before retired in the early 2000s. Glenne Headley as his girlfriend, Tess Trueheart is forgettable. Sean Young claims she was forced out of the role of Tess Truehart after rebuffing sexual advances from Beatty. I think Sean Young would had made the movie, ever worse. She's not a favor of mine. Charlie Korsmo as the nameless ""Kid"" that Dick Tracy adopt was too annoying to care about. Al Pacino might be a little over the top silly, to be taken seriously as a threat. He never once, seem menacing. I was deeply surprised he was nominated for an Academy Award for this role that year. I thought, it was one of his worst performance, ever. Madonna, who was then in a relationship with Beatty, pursued the part of Breathless Mahoney, but offered to work for scale to avoid any appearance of nepotism, because they were in a relationship at the time. I guess Madonna really wanted Beatty's dick. Surprising Madonna's acting is probably the best of all. Still, her acting wasn't much of a stretch. She was indeed sexy as the femme fatale lounge singer. Most of the music, she does in the film, works. The song, 'Sooner or Later' by Stephen Sondheim and sung by Madonna is great sexy lounge music. Glad, it won Best Original Song at the Oscars that year. The song ""more' doesn't deserve any awards. It sounds like a Marilyn Monroe 'Diamond are a girl's best friend' rip off song. It's cut to pieces anyways with the horrible editing. It's annoying smug. While, Madonna didn't do these songs, 'Back in Business' & ""Live alone and like it' were pretty catchy. Still, I don't know why 'Live alone and like it' was put in a montage of Dick Tracy's doing family things. That was a bit weird. Once again, bad editing ruin that song, as well. While, not feature in the film, 'Vogue' was indeed part of the Dick Tracy soundtrack. Vogue would become one of Madonna's greatest hits of all time. Danny Elfman theme song was disappointing. I really wanted more for him. One of the striking features of the film was its attempt to replicate, in live action, the flat colors and limited palette of the pulp magazine atmosphere. It did delivered great in the old school effects. The Matte painting was visually beautiful. One drawback to that, you can't move the camera. I guess the static camera is obviously a tribute to the panels of a comic book, but it kinda looks lazy. The makeup is pretty cool. I love seeing the many distort faces of the criminals. Still, some of them, look a bit too fake looking. Holy crap, for a PG film, you have a lot of sexual innuendos. Breathless in a sheer nightdress, wearing barely anything at all is very scandalous. Lots of see-through nipples. Not only the sex, but the violence. It's somewhat very graphic for a kid's movie. Lots of people getting mow down by Tommy Guns. While, the film was a hit. However, a combination of underperforming and the overtone cost, cause a sequel to never be made. Disney had hoped Dick Tracy would launch a successful franchise, like the Indiana Jones series, but sadly decades-long battle over the rights between Beatty and the Tribune Co. put any immediate follow-ups to the long run. So Dick Tracy 2 is not on his way, anytime soon. Overall: This movie isn't perfect, but it's not the worst. This surrealistic comic book need a comeback, and I hope it does. It does need it.",Dick Tracy

This 1990 production featured the 'handsome as a movie star' Warren Beatty, not only as the Star; but also doing triple duty as Producer and Sitting in the Director's chair.BEING THAT THE Daily & Sunday Comic Strip of DICK TRACY had made its original appearance in print in 1931 and continues to the present, the production team had a choice of several eras from which to use in its presentation. Wisely, they chose the post prohibition Gangster days of the 1930's; which just happens to be the historical time-frame of the strip's genesis.WITH THE FOUNDATION of a top rate cast, the film was constituted with a most interesting script, great original musical sound tract, highly creative photography and color work that mimicked the primary four-color lithography of the news print. There was a definite attempt to create the look of a comic strip come to life.BY THE WAY, they succeeded! COINCIDING WITH THE release was a tremendous wave of ""Dick Tracy"" items that swept like a deluge over the department stores. Apparently the intelligentsia at Disney and the Chicago Tribune enterprises had figure on a new mo$t lucrative franchise; duplicating that of Batman in the late 1960's.WELL, AS WE ALL now know, these things did not pan out. The movie did less than spectacular business; in spite of its honest effort to stay as close to the DICK TRACY of the newspaper comics section.WHAT WENT WRONG, we ask our selves? Perhaps too much was expected of it. With so much riding on its success, nothing but superlatives were acceptable. Soon, the various Dick Tracy hats, trench coats, toys, games, coloring books, etc., were relegated to the remainder racks.NEEDLESS TO SAY, there wasn't a sequel; and that was too bad. Isn't that right, Schultz?",Dick Tracy
40,leplatypus,Dick has nearly came (web),7,10 November 2011,"In a Madonna's bio, I read that DT was the Disney's answer to the successful Batman. DT being not Gothic, it's also a film noir but Beatty chose to do a Technicolor cartoon adventure instead. This feast of colors is really the big attraction of this movie: I don't know any other movie where all the production is based on the basic colors (yellow, red, green, blue). It's clear, simple and it really looks the panel of a old comics.With that, the movie is great with associating a good cast (Madonna is a decent femme fatal and Al is very funny playing a bigger than nature Don). The music is also top-level, as much the Madonna's songs than Danny's score (the action and love themes are worthy of his Batman).On the other hand, DT lacks a good script and maybe a better actor for DT than Beatty because he doesn't look like very motivated. He told the kid to go at the orphanage but he stayed; he kissed Madonna but didn't really help her; he loves Tess but can't commit. In other words, Beatty is better at directing than at acting.",Dick Tracy

I normally find movies that are loaded with cameos distracting. ""Dick Tracy"" manages to make them all fun. The cast is perfect. The normally obnoxious Al Pacino delivers a terrific performance. The only demerit is Danny Elfman's music. I enjoy this soundtrack. I've owned the CD for many years. It's just that it's too similar to his music for ""Batman"". Tonight, for some reason, it bothered me. Honorable mention: Dustin Hoffman.",Dick Tracy
42,GOWBTW,"Enjoyed its comics, enjoyed the movie as well!",10,20 February 2006,"I can remember reading the Sunday Comics about ""Dick Tracy"", I even saw the cartoons as well. And all the oldies, there's the Big Screen version of the movie. All of the action, all of the characters: Big Boy Caprice(Al Pacino), Flattop(William Forsyth), Itchy, Pruneface, Shoulders, The Brow, The Rodent, and all the other goons Dick Tracy had to fight were here. I know most of the goons battled Dick Tracy, but just like the others, they battled each other as well. As the old saying, ""no honor among criminals"". Warren Beatty played Dick Tracy, HANDS DOWN! The yellow hat and overcoat, the radio watch, and his hard-nosed attitude against crime is always there. The Kid(Charlie Korsmo) is very gluttonous whenever he eats, no family, no home, the streets were his ways of means. If he hadn't met Dick Tracy, he would be in bigger trouble. Madonna was fabulous at playing Breathless Mahoney, she trusted Tracy more than Caprice. Even ""The Blank"" was more of a snitch than a ally of Big Boy. The movie was excellent, and stunts were awesome. And Beatty was stoic after the explosion scene. Also to know I can draw DICK TRACY as well, and it's PERFECT! 5 STARS!",Dick Tracy
43,FiendishDramaturgy,Genuinely Good,9,17 March 2007,"Beatty's choice of color and light, style, and awesome casting all come together with a compelling mob script to make one heck of a movie.This was a real surprise, as I had personally never thrilled in the Dick Tracy line, but this film is top row! The all-star cast comes together in a startling way to present this well-written script in such a way as to thoroughly entertain.The resulting final product is s solidly executed, vividly presented, well written, brilliantly directed retro-actioner, which is both story AND character driven.Frankly, there wasn't anything NOT to like about this one. I do speak, however, as a non-fan of the original source. I've read Dick Tracy throughout my life, here and there, but I've never really liked the work. THIS, I liked.It rates an 8.8/10 from...the Fiend :.",Dick Tracy
44,hellraiser7,Colorful Detective on the Case,10,28 July 2020,"This is one of my favorite films of all time as well as comic book/action films. This film is of course based on a comic strip series that was a big phenomenon at the time, way before the Marvel and DC superheroes. There was lots of merchandise for it you can probably find now in antiquity malls, a radio show, old serial movies, you name it. It was even parodied on an episode of ""Looney Tunes"" with Daffy Duck playing Tracy. And was a partial inspiration to the graphic comic series/movie ""Sin City"".This film also became a phenomenon in 1990 if only briefly. I was about nine years old and I honestly never knew anything about the ""Dick Tracy"" comic series until I saw this movie it just blew me away as I became an instant fan. I remember being in costume as Dick Tracy on Halloween 1990. Even played the video game for the Sega Genesis which to me was solid (reviewed the game long ago). This was also a film that introduced me to genres like the gangster pics, noir, and detective/mystery and really got me interested in them for a while.There are only two misfires in the film, for one think I didn't feel Tracy got to kick enough ass. There are action sequences, but it doesn't happen till near the end of the film. Would have liked it if Tracy had a few fist a cuff scuffle or even another shootout or two on the beginning and middle of the film. However due to the film pace I hardly notice as Tracy and the Villains are always working.The other misfire of the film, I thought Tess was just really uninteresting and a bit generic, I know in the series Tess is Tracy's significant other just as Iris West is for Barry Allen/The Flash, Mary Jane Watson for Peter Parker/Spider Man, and so forth but I want to know why Tracy is in love with her, who is she to him as well as just who she is as a character.There is just a lot to like about this film. I like that the film plays out like a straightforward old school detective gangster action thriller which is exactly what the comic strip series is. There are no bullcrap twists or subplots which have now plagued most detective TV shows like ""CSI"" and ""CSI Miami"" (just sometimes) which always annoy me because their just filler which always skirts around the ongoing plot, this film keeps it's eye on the ball and gets right down to business. The film is suspenseful but in a different way, it's a double layer where we are in the gangster's perspective as we see them putting their nefarious plan in action. We are also in Tracy's perspective as he is on their trail. The suspense is hoping Tracy will be able to put it all together in time so he can do what he does best in the comic strip, win.The film is also kind of funny as the film doesn't take things too seriously, from a confession scene with Dick Tracy to Mumbles. We see him tempt Mumbles with water and of course Mumbles mumbles something, this of course leads to a payoff later as we find out what that is. And certain other funny bits which I don't want to give away.We also have the characters; this is one with a start studded cast where there are lots of familiar faces that play all the characters from the comic from the protagonists down to the colorful rogues. They're not all deep characters as the pulp comics were more concerned about the action and adventure but they all have unique personalities to make them all stand out.""Flat Top"" played well by William Forshye who is really sold as the right-hand man of Big Boy. R.G. Armstrong as ""Pruneface"" also solid as he's got that dry vinegar menace to him hence his name. ""Mumbles"" played by Dustin Hoffman, he's really funny as he simply just mumbles.And of course, the main boss ""Big Boy"" played well by Al Pacino, this is one of my favorite roles from him, he of course is no stranger to the mob boss role but here he's a more comical one. He's a fun over the top villain you love to dislike, and I feel an underrated fictional villain. His character as some of the best lines and scenes, I like that because he's aggressive, he's true to his name as he has big crooked ambitions with the ego to boot as he has delusions of granger where in his mind he sees himself as the next big figure in history. That's brought up a lot in the film as we see he's a big fan of historical figures, in the mobster meeting scene he brings up two familiar name but also in other scenes he's always quoting what other historical figures said.Madonna as Breathless which she is true to the role. She is pretty much the mysterious feme fatale from the noirs, really like the look of her which looks like the women from the noirs of yesteryear. I like the chemistry between both Tracy and her. I always found the interaction between both Breathless and Tracy interesting, both are like that noir couple that are somewhat flirting with danger. You can say it reflects Tracy's pursuit on the case where the answer is always so close and yet elusive at the same time.But it's of course a love triangle as there is that other woman in Tracy's life Tess whom as I said found boring. It's a bit sad as you feel both Breathless and him could have been something had they met years ago, but sadly it just wasn't in the cards. But the character Breathless is slightly interesting as like most of the fem fatales in noirs is really mysterious, you always sense she has an ulterior motive/goal in mine as she is always getting mixed up with shady people but you not sure what it is, but it all comes together in a certain twist in the end.But of course, we're here for the protagonist himself Dick Tracy played well by Warren Betty. Warren Betty was just perfect for the role of Tracy because he really is ""Dick Tracy"". Much like Karl Urban is ""Judge Dredd"", Christopher Reeve is ""Superman"", Peter Weller is ""Robocop"" and so forth you just don't see anyone else in that role, nor do you want to.Not much to say about Tracy except that he's a straight laced police detective, but what I really like about him is the fact that despite playing by the rules he's not afraid to bend, break or even make his own rules. He's aware of that but in order to beat the villains you can't always go by the book for the book doesn't cover everything that happens in reality.But I also like that this is a guy that's incorruptible he never bends to corruption and scum of any kind, he doesn't take crap or let any other innocent soul take crap from them.One other thing about him that was cool was that he always had a wristwatch that acted as a radio communicator. I always thought that was cool, I wanted one and this was way before wireless cell phones.However, by its nature this film is really style overtopping substance. This film in a way predates ""Sin City"" as it has just as much color as that comic series/movie, the film really feels like the comic strip series come to life as you just see this alternate America that has so much color everywhere you look it's a buffet for the eyes. From how the buildings are painted and constructed all of it is practical including the make up effects, so there is no CGI crap that exists in this dojo.The wardrobe they wear, I really love the colorful suits, trench coats, and hats of the gangsters and detectives. My favorite one of course is Tracy's wardrobe, which consists of a yellow trench coat and hat, who'd of thought yellow could actually be a really cool color, you can say this was before the ""Yellow Ranger"" from the ""Power Ranger"" franchise made it seem cool. But that color suited Tracy showing that he was the light of justice in the darkness of the city.The makeup work is great, it is some of the best make up work I've ever seen in films. All the criminals in a way are sort of mutants as each of them have grotesque, inhuman mugs much like in the comics, which is an externalization and reflection of their dirty internal natures.Also, the music is great, this film has one of the best scores and soundtracks in any movie. Each of the songs are just memorable and really fit the era the film was set in. I really love the theme song which is one of my favorites of all time. This score of course from one of my favorite movie composers Danny Elfman whom was just on a winning streak at the time as he did plenty of memorable scores in the early 90's for plenty of memorable movie and TV shows, this is one of them as it just sings the character name and the era he does his work in.The action is solid if nothing too extraordinary. From a final fist a cuff battle but my favorite is of course the shootout near the end of the film, which is one of my favorite battles of all time as it's is just a bullet fest. Just seeing Big Boys gangsters trying to make a break for it and Dick Tracy armed with a Tommy Gun along with the other cops they are just blasting away at the oncoming cars. I remember how excited I was as a kid, pretending to be armed with a Tommy Gun and blasting away at the gangsters.Dick Tracy shines with color and hits the target.Rating: 4 stars",Dick Tracy
45,generationofswine,An Honest Review,10,27 November 2016,"It isn't a bad movie.For starters it looks fake but in an awesome way. The colors are far to vibrant, the sets look like stages, it is all done to add to the comic book atmosphere and it all works. It makes it, on an aesthetic level, just a beautiful movie to watch.It also gives the audience the feel that they are watching it live. It gives it a play sort of feeling. It feels like live theater and not a movie.Only in live theater the colors never pop so much.It's like watching live theater on LSD.And then the costumes are equally over-the-top lending further to the over all Sunday morning comic book feel.It all works on a bright and vibrant level.And it is all fun.They never ask you to take the movie too seriously, which is amazing because all the actors take their roles very seriously.The result is a comic feel with a cast that makes you believe they are all for real.Beautiful, fun, light and entertaining.",Dick Tracy
46,jadavix,Good,7,4 April 2019,"""Dick Tracy"" came out the year after Burton's ""Batman"", which is still my favourite comic book movie. But whereas ""Batman"" had an extraordinarily rich back-story for the filmmakers to draw from, ""Dick Tracy"" was a mere comic strip, with characters well and truly two, or even one, dimensional.The hero, for example, is no dark knight. He's a straight-arrow copper who wears a yellow hat and coat.Speaking of colour, the movie seems to have been filmed only in the basic hues of the comic strip.What's extraordinary about ""Dick Tracy"" is the way the filmmakers have tried to emulate the bizarre, caricatured looks of the comic strip's characters, and how well they have succeeded.What's also extraordinary is the number of great actors who appeared in the movie, many of whom are unrecognizable under the rubber.I liked ""Dick Tracy"", mostly, though it was boring in parts.

Superhero films have been coming out of the woodwork in recent years, and may soon become a genre all on its own.Beatty's film liberally uses Gould's source material to full effect, shooting in all six of the strip's primary colors, and thus giving this unique yet familiar world of trigger-happy mutant gangsters and loose, seductive women a lush visual style and tone.It can be stated that the film's strong visual aesthetics drastically short-change the characters and their acting abilities, which I don't think can be any further from the truth.""Dick Tracy"" relishes in its look and ghastly characters, and Beatty himself, who plays the dogged and incorruptible detective of the title, is appropriately stoic and ready to bust the bad guys at any and all costs.Other than the visual treats and Oscar-winning makeup, there is a plot, and Big Boy Caprice (Al Pacino, deliciously over-the-top in an Oscar-nominated performance), seeks to eliminate Tracy in one well-planned move, but also seeks to gain control of all criminal action in the city by uniting all the feuding gangs under him.Tracy, meanwhile, is juggling his relationship with Tess Trueheart (Glenne Headly), who as her name would have it, remains faithfully by his side and cares for The Kid (Charlie Korsmo), who eventually finds a father figure to look up to in our crime-busting hero. Tracy's fidelity to Tess is tested by the tempting advances of Breathless Mahoney (Madonna), who is also Big Boy's main squeeze. At the same time that all of this is going down, things become heated when a new criminal figure arrives in town, and decides to play both sides against the middle.The performances are good, as Beatty's focus on the strained and romantic relationships between each of the leads becomes the center of the material, as opposed to just concentrating on pointless action and special effects. Pacino freely chews up the scenery in a role that's truly standout from the rest.""Dick Tracy"" is one of the best and most overlooked of the comic book movie genre. I think that if Chester Gould was still alive, he would be proud of Warren Beatty's take on his beloved crime-fighting detective.8/10",Dick Tracy

49,mjneu59,"looks good, but lacks a screenplay",4,13 November 2010,"On its own merits (minus the impressive promotional smokescreen) the latest appearance of Chester Gould's fabled gumshoe is an empty but otherwise innocent comic strip adventure. The film is difficult to dislike, but it's even more difficult to overlook the gaping hole where its title character should be. After making every villain a lively cartoon caricature, director/star Warren Beatty either forgot or (out of vanity?) declined to provide himself with comparable make-up to match his character's familiar, square-jawed profile. The comic book design is certainly dazzling, with its artificial sets and primary colors (all ""eight"" of them, according to Beatty), but without a story to hold it all together the novelty wears thin quickly. A successful film needs more than just clever make-up and production design, but Dick Tracy offers nothing else of interest; the monotonous, jury-rigged plot moves back and forth without progressing anywhere, and the presence of Madonna is an instant liability. Needless to say, it's a far cry from 'Bonnie and Clyde'.",Dick Tracy
50,drqshadow-reviews,A Confused Slight to Moviegoers Young and Old,1,26 January 2012,"A boldly literal interpretation of what was, at the time, sixty-year-old source material, Dick Tracy was dated before it had even commenced filming. In today's world, it's a painful reminder of what happens when badly misread cultural trends, aging showbiz producers and a full committee of writers collide on-screen. Visually it's a day-glow disaster, combining recklessly outlandish wardrobe, distractingly obvious matte-painting backdrops, startlingly grotesque makeup effects and an odd mix of kids' primary colors with ink-black noir lighting. The cast is so stale, weak and one-dimensional throughout that not even an A-list staff of Hollywood's elite is able to play life preserver: Dustin Hoffman, James Caan and Al Pacino are lost amidst the flood of stilted dialog, Madonna sleepwalks through a rotten performance as, basically, herself, and Warren Beatty is so squeaky clean and unrelentingly straightforward in the leading role that it almost works on a purely satirical level. Clearly someone, somewhere, saw the runaway success of Tim Burton's Batman around the corner and chose to grant a similar treatment to a character they recalled from the funny pages of their own youth, without stopping to consider if Tracy's story was as relevant and trans-generational as Bruce Wayne's. The splashy colors and simple, hackneyed plot make it a no-sell to adults, while the abundance of sex and violence also makes it tough to buy as a kid's movie. Genuinely awful from start to finish, I had to watch in three installments because it kept putting me to sleep.",Dick Tracy
51,st-shot,Colorfully bland.,6,1 August 2011,The long running comic strip comes to the screen with vapid results as director actor Warren Beatty removes most of the comic possibilities and Tracy's unwavering certitude with the silent indecisive signature close-ups Warren likes to employ on himself replacing it. It has an excellent Toon Town look due to the master craftsman employed to decorate ( Richard Sylbert) and lens (Vittorio Storaro) it but the result is one tedious primary color fiesta and little more.Tracy is a dick 24/7. He would like to marry Tess Trueheart but can't divorce himself from his job with the diabolical Big Boy Caprice running amok. Further complicating matters is Breathless Mahoney (Madonna) whose working him from both angles.Tracy has a fun look as it barrages you with every color of the rainbow on everything it records. The famous thugs row of mugs from the strip are excellently re-created with Dustin Hoffman in the small roll of Mumbles and especially Al Pacino as the Plato quoting Caprice giving the film the rare glimpses of humor it can muster. Much of the film however is wasted on Beatty's posing and Madonna's complete inability to once again show any acting chops (even as a comic strip character) as Tracy meanders to its predictable fireworks conclusion with little to celebrate.,Dick Tracy
52,CubsandCulture,I am really not sure why more films don't try stuff like this...,10,3 February 2020,"This film is one of my earliest memories for going to the movies. The bold- yet limited-color palette realized in an overall design aesthetic that is strikingly graphic yet classical has stayed with me for years. The way in which the make-up effects give character to even the smallest bit part does a lot of work in the film. This is my first *experience* of the possibilities of cinema. For all you want to pick at the film's writing and storyline it tries to be different. If nothing else the graphic quality of the film is fun. Fun is the good word for it. There is something quaint about this film that has it decidedly earnest and colorful for its own sake. It is a throw back to when visual distinctiveness was used to sell character. For influential as German expressionism was and continues to be in certain genres a shocking number of popcorn films don't have fun visuals. This film is a peacock among pigeons. I think that is the main reason I like it so much.Now the writing, and truth be told the acting, is a little stiff. I don't think I was ever surprised by the final reveal of Noface. The film does adhere a bit too closely to convention but there's a delight and lightness to the dialog that keeps the proceedings fun. Sure the characters are wafer thin but god saves us from a Big Boy with ""emotional"" depth. This is a popcorn film that loves pulp and if take it on that level it is a really fun and funny film.I said the acting was a little stiff. That's true. Beatty plays Tracy a little too earnestly. Madonna gives her one of her better performances here but that is not saying much. But Pacino steals the show in this film. His Big Boy is one of his most endearing characters and he hams it up in exactly the way the material calls for. I almost wish he got the Oscar for this instead of A Scent of Woman. I think you could legitimately make a case for it being his best performance given how much he improves the film and gets the tone of it too work.",Dick Tracy

Thankfully the former overwhelms the latter to the point that it doesn't matter. Much. Unlike the previous year's game changing 'Batman', 'Dick Tracy' embraces its comic roots and attempts to create the strip come to life, and it succeeds for the most part. In other ways it blatantly mimics Tim Burton's blockbuster, right down to its clock tower ending and Danny Elfman score.In the end I was very surprised that I enjoyed this much more in 2015 as a 41 year old than in 1990 as a 16 year old.

If you ask me, 88 Keys (Mandy Patinkin) was a good piano player and singer. The one character that scared me a little was Big Boy (Al Pacino). Even thought he scared me a little, I thought he gave a good performance. I believe that Tess (Glenne Headly) looked very pretty, especially in the outfits she wore when she and Tracy went out on dates. Before I wrap this up, I'd like to say that when I think about it, I laugh when I think about Flattop (William Forsythe) saying, ""Hey, copper, maybe you ought to look before you leap. We've got rights."" Now, in conclusion, I recommend this smash hit to those of you that are fans of Warren Beatty or like crime flicks.",Dick Tracy

56,TOMNEL,A surrealistic comic book masterpiece.,8,18 November 2007,"""Dick Tracy"" is, in many ways, an underrated masterpiece generally not recognized as being as good as it is by the public.""Dick Tracy"" has a charm that none of the other superhero, or comic book movies have. It looks beautiful. The idea of putting partial set-pieces in with an animated background was genius. It obviously doesn't look real, but it gives this movie a wonderfully surrealistic look. This movie also probably has more prosthetic body parts than any other movie. The characters, excluding a few main ones, are all as cartoonish and ugly as can be. Whether it be a fake over-sized nose, a huge pair of lips, or an exaggeratedly huge head, they all look really good, and make this look like the material it was based on. The amazing style that ""Dick Tracy"" has still not been outdone after all these years.Style over substance is often how this movie is criticized, and while that is true, this still has a good plot with subtle character development. Big Boy Caprice (Al Pacino) is taking over the city, and it's up to Dick Tracy (Warren Beatty) to take him down. Meanwhile Tracy finds an orphan, has trouble with his girlfriend, and is framed for murder. The plot is kind of Goodfellas meets Batman. To help along a pretty good, occasionally too reliant on montages plot, there is an amazing cast. Dustin Hoffman, Mandy Patinkan, James Caan, Kathy Bates, Dick Van Dyke, Kathy Bates, Paul Sorvino, Catherine O'Hara and many other recognizable faces show up (though some are hard to recognize behind all the makeup and prosthetics). In addition to all this, the songs by Steven Sondheim are great, and the musical score by Danny Elfman gives a superhero tint to film noir music.Overall, though it is somewhat loosely plotted, ""Dick Tracy"" looks and sounds just as great as the original comics. It's a visual masterpiece.My rating: *** out of ****. PG for violence. 102 mins.",Dick Tracy
57,truemythmedia,Not For Everyone,8,22 April 2019,"While the over the top performances and stylized world might not be for everyone, this is a film that certainly worked wonders for me. There are silly parts, exciting action packed sequences, bizarre and even ludicrous characters, and some rather touching moments too. But really what sold me on this movie was it's influential style. I'd venture to guess that this film is at least partially resonsible for the greenlighting of comic book films like ""Sin City"" or ""300"", because all of these films use a kind of (for lack of a better term) comic-realism. Pacino is absolutely fantastic as the crass and brash Big Boy Caprice, and Warren Beatty is perfect as our titular character.

58,Samiam3,Flashy amusing and memorable (despite a lack of story),7,4 June 2010,"No 20th century motion picture feels more like a comic book than Dick Tracy. Its flashy retro approach takes us back to the jazzy 1930's when showgirls had short blonde (pre-Marylin Monroe) hair, men wore long brimmed hats, and smoked fat cigars. The movie is a lot of fun, but the end result feels like it needs something more...a better script. Warren Beatty's primary intention is to put a comic book on celluloid, investing so much into art and design that he cares too little for story. The film is a direct throwback to the age when comic books started getting adapted to other mediums. With the rise of television in the 1950's batman, spider man and others found their way into people living rooms, both as cartoons and live action (Adam West). From today's perspective those programmes are so stiff, and hokey that they have become almost laughable. Dick Tracy manages to recapture some of those dated charms, and successfully loosened it up a bit. The fight scenes are less chucky (though they still lack gusto) and There are times when the picture is self-mocking (especially whenever Al Pachino is on screen), but the scenario remains fairly shallow and artificial. Even if the film is not lovable, it is impossible not to like it even a bit. I'll raise my glass to the art department, and cinematographer Vittorio Storaro. The Urbanized Americana world in Dick Tracy is the kind of place I'd love to have a vacation in. actually, I am reminded a bit of the New York New York hotel in Las Vegas. Dick Tracy is certainly not a film to miss, it needs some work for sure. Although it seems to be headed for obscurity (in part because of it's lacking recognition and financial success) It remains pretty unique even today.",Dick Tracy
59,breakdownthatfilm-blogspot-com,A distinct comic strip movie adaptation,9,26 May 2013,"Just like The Phantom (1996), The Shadow (1994) and The Rocketeer (1991), the 1990's was the decade Hollywood thought it would be a great idea to revive older comic book/strip characters from the 1930's due to the strong reception from Richard Donner's Superman (1978) and Tim Burton's Batman (1989). Unfortunately, none of these films did fantastic at the box office because of the lack of support. But that doesn't mean what was produced, was poor material. This film is probably the one that lit the fuse to construct the other three later to come.There is a subtle difference between this particular film and the other three - the sense of realism. The setting is the same, which takes place in the 1930's but the world that detective Dick Tracy lives in, is a little bit unrealistic. But this is what makes it so avant-garde. For example, Each characters name depicts what they are like. If a mob member's name is called ""Flattop"", they will literally have a flat top. Or another named ""Little Face"", truly has a small face. Each character is a characacher of their own name. This is actually rather clever and funny at the same time. I liked that a lot, even if no person would ever have such a misshapen body structure.Starring is Warren Beatty, an acclaimed actor, best known for his role in Bonnie and Clyde (1967), directs his third film with this comic strip icon - Detective Dick Tracy. Along with him, co-stars Al Pacino, a very young Madonna, Paul Sorvino, Glenne Headly even Dick Van Dyke and several others. And even with a big cast, sometimes films don't do well, but here, it works out well because of how likable these characters are. Beatty plays Tracy like it's been his job for more than his acting career. Madonna is attractive and highly seductive like she was supposed to be, so that works. Even Al Pacino as the villain gives some comedic relief. It's funny because how his make-up was applied makes him look like a Muppet.What also stood out was just how colorful the entire film was, in its most basic form that is. Movies now a days and even back then contained a multiple array of colors but in Beatty's film, it sticks to your regular Kindergarten colors - green, yellow, red, blue, black, orange... and so on. There are no shades to these primary and secondary colors. They are just your basic crayons and it really stands out. Dick Tracy wouldn't be as memorable to me if he didn't wear his banana colored fedora and trench coat. It just wouldn't be the same and it's because of these colors that help accentuate the exaggerations of the characters.Lastly, comes the music score provided by none other than Danny Elfman. What's great about Elfman's score in this particular work is that he gives the comic strip hero and his love interest each their own memorable theme. Along with that are Elfman's other tracks that contain a lot of jazzy tunes consisting of trumpets and other instruments from that specific time. I did find it cliché though to how the famous detective gets himself into trouble for a lot of silly things because he's either not paying attention or because he lets his selfishness get to him. But that's about it.The movie adaptation of the 1930's comic strip detective is colorful, clever, has great performances and memorable music. It's writing is shaky in some places but it still holds up to a very entertaining movie.",Dick Tracy
60,PredragReviews,"Calling ""Dick Tracy!""",9,8 April 2016,"Dick Tracy"" is an incredible movie and can be enjoyed by everyone of all ages... This film won three Oscars for Makeup, Art Direction, and Best Original Song (Sooner Or Later).Warren Beatty stars as Tracy; a tough detective who is determined to fight crime at any cost. One of the main bad guys he is trying to get off the streets for good is none other than Big Boy (Al Pacino). But Big Boy isn't going down without a fight, and is willing to put a stop to Tracy's career with his gang of colorful hoodlums... I really did enjoy this movie, and it is a classic. There are still elements of danger and suspense... The actors did a great job. Beatty is awesome as Tracy, but I have to say this; as always, it is Pacino who steals the show. He is so alive and colorful in this movie. Had it not been for his famous voice, you would've never known it was Al... Warren Beatty also directed the movie and did an awesome job at doing so. Everything about the movie was convincing and believable. Had this project been given to someone else, chances are that the results wouldn't had been as good.Dick Tracy is a well acted, visually glamorous and stupendous movie- going experience that's a fun throw back to old film-noirs and jazzy detective yarns filled with blazing tommy guns and screeching tires. I loved it! And I wished they'd make more movies like it, but I guess in some ways you could argue that they are making a bit of a come back, but instead of splashes of color here and there, Dick Tracy is an overwhelming tidal wave of color, and it sweeps you up off your feet and away.Overall rating: 9 out of 10.",Dick Tracy
61,DeeNine-2,"Yes, that's Dustin Hoffman mumbling in the corner",5,1 October 1999,"(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book ""Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!"" Get it at Amazon.)The story doesn't matter. The plot doesn't matter. How could we identify with these fake characters anyway? What matters here is fidelity to the comic strip and the interesting effects on our eyes as we see what a cartoon looks like come to life, so to speak. The shadow of Dick Tracy thrown large against the warehouse wall, the sharp brim of his hat, his square jaw, the drawn gun proceeding him, as Chester Gould so often drew him-this is what counts. Combining cartoon drawings, such as city streets and building facades and billboards in the background, with flesh and blood characters in the foreground makes for an interesting montage. The little shack, made small by the night sky and the big city towers, as in a Taoist drawing, is also true to a Gould frame. The intense contrasting and clashing colors, especially Tracy's yellow top coat and yellow hat, and Tess Trueheart's red, red dress and red hair-all these intense reds and greens and blues treat our eyes to something different.Problem is, who cares? Or ""so what?"" as Popeye used to say. Madonna does her one-millionth Marilyn Monroe imitation. It's okay, although I would prefer the real thing. Al Pacino, with the prodigious proboscis, aptly burlesques his character, but what's the point? Warren Beatty (did he reject a fake jaw to stay pretty?) works hard to be the square-jawed, taciturn Tracy, and that's a handicap because then there is nothing to do except swing fists and spray bullets. Glenne Headly, trying to project some heart felt emotion, comes off as terribly out of place, since how can you weep for the love of a cartoon?The gutter snipe kid befriended by Tracy, played memorably by Charlie Korsmo (""Suck eggs, copper!""), stands out somehow as the only one who seems real; and maybe that's right because only a kid could find involvement in such a shallow, if decorous enterprise.Sharp-eyed movie aficionados will have fun picking out the star-studded cast among the cartoon faces.",Dick Tracy
62,BrandtSponseller,"Well, it looks pretty",5,12 February 2005,"With his sights primarily set on Big Boy Caprice (Al Pacino), Dick Tracy (Warren Beatty) tries to round up a number of gangsters. At the same time, he informally adopts a street kid (Charlie Korsmo), encounters problems with girlfriend Tess Trueheart (Glenne Headly), and flirts with Breathless Mahoney (Madonna).If I were to rate Dick Tracy only on production design--sets, matte paintings, costumes, special make-up, color schemes, and so on--I wouldn't hesitate to give it a 10. Throughout its length, the film looks fantastic--like a surreal, day-glo, pop art film noir. Super saturated primary and secondary colors dominate, occasionally offset by rich tertiary colors. The colors are consistently combined in effective, varied and intriguing ways. The surreal ""locations"" are a combination of matte paintings and sets seamlessly melded in a manner that remains technically impressive. The make-up effects for Dick Tracy's bizarre characters are excellent. They manage to both capture the precise look of the comic books villains and appear realistic at the same time. If the film were just a set of art photos and/or paintings, it would be one of the masterpieces of at least the 1990s.However, as a film, there's a story that writers Jim Cash and Jack Epps, Jr. want to tell. That story is a complete mess. For some godforsaken reason, Cash and Epps try to include every villain from the Tracy comics that they can remember. They seem to also include half of the plot lines they can remember. But they forget to write in any explanation or motivation for why Tracy is going after whomever he's going after at a given moment. Combined with overly quick, abrupt editing that too often bounces back and forth between unrelated scenes, the plot seems as if Cash and Epps set out bullet points of villains, villain interconnections and schemes, then threw them together almost randomly in a string of non-sequiturs.Characters played by well-known and capable actors are completely wasted. There's just not enough time to get into them. Others, such as Madonna, seem to have demanded contractual clauses that guaranteed screen time (in this case featuring singing) whether the appearance serviced the story or not. Some of the cast, such as Pacino, crazily overact. Others, such as William Forsythe as Flattop, turn in understated performances. I don't mind either style (and who is more fun to watch chewing scenery than Pacino?) but Beatty, who also directed, appears to have not known what he wanted to shoot for in that capacity. Part of the problem could be confusion due to the script being such a mess. Beatty, by the way, displays a peculiar inability to change his facial expression, which remains cemented in a seemingly new character--I'll name him ""Frogface""--throughout the film (maybe that's how Beatty always is and I just didn't notice it so much before). In terms of his vocal phrasing and general emoting, Beatty portrays Tracy as a cross between Bob Newhart, Keanu Reeves and Harrison Ford. I like all of those other actors, and I'm definitely a fan of oddities, but in this context, I'm not sure it works. I was never a big reader of the Tracy comics, though. Maybe it's a perfect fit, but I'm guessing that it makes as much sense as Gilbert Gottfried as Batman (which, come to think of it, I'd like to see, but obviously more as a spoof).There appear to be fans of this film, so the plot must not be such a mess and the performances must not be so questionable in everyone's opinion. For my part, I suggest that you watch the film like a slide show while you put on a couple CDs for a soundtrack and ignore any pretense of a story.",Dick Tracy
63,TheUnknown837-1,Mr. Beatty's devotion to resemble the source comic strip counts for and against his picture.,6,30 June 2011,"As somebody who is constantly griping about the lack of ambition in contemporary cinema, I find it extremely difficult for me to blast a movie that does the opposite of its many vision-starved coevals. Especially when it's been so lovingly cared-for as Warren Beatty's ""Dick Tracy,"" a mega-blockbuster from the dawn of the 1990s. But alas, I tragically have to. For despite all that it has going for it, despite all that it got right (and it got a lot right), the movie ultimately tries to cram so much into so little and came off, for me anyway, as a little empty. It just didn't wow me as its marvelous art direction made me want it to.Mr. Beatty's fear that no sequel would be made to his film ultimately came true, and because of his prediction he shoved well over twenty characters from the long-running Charles Gould comic strip series into a 105-minute window. So many characters for so simplistic a plot. Director/producer Mr. Beatty also plays the square-jawed detective bent on catching his arch-nemesis in the act. His fiend is the united mob's leader, Big Boy Caprice (Al Pacino), a cantankerous, self-delusional patriarch with an endless array of punch lines. Whenever he's not attempting to pin a charge on the mobster, Tracy is tending to a runaway orphan (Charlie Korsmo) and attempting to maintain his relationships between two women. One a quiet little botanist (Glenne Headly) the other a sexy nightclub singer (Madonna).Amidst them are countless other peculiar individuals, many of them portrayed by famous stars clad in heavy make-up. But there we have the first of the movie's problems. There are more than twenty characters from the comic strip, all crammed in there so tautly, and yet so desperately for screen attention, that few of them ultimately leave any kind of a mark. Even though R.G. Armstrong and William Forsythe are extremely good in the movie, the only thing really distinguishing is the level of cosmetics applied to their faces. There are so many villains and so many of them demand attention and yet the only one who really stands out is Mr. Pacino, who gives one of the most happily hyperbolic and energetic performances of his career as Big Boy Caprice.Another problem the movie has is an ambition to show and contain so much within so short a window. As a result, many sequences skimp over without leaving any kind of a mark. The denouement, though unexpected by me, came off as kind of flat because of the narrow writing and overly-taut editing. And frankly, even though Mr. Beatty does a great job playing the straight-face detective most of the time, his dynamics with the two central women in the plot are flimsy and not so interesting. Now in a comic strip, one can get away with a narrow narrative and characterizations, because all of that is being contained within a stretch lasting a page or two of panels. But for a feature-length movie, unless done with some surefire cadence, this formula doesn't quite work.The movie attempts to be a lot like the comic strip, but it only truly achieves that in the art department. The set design by Richard Sylbert and Rick Simmons (who swept away the Academy Award for this film) do a spot-on job of presenting the comic book world in which Dick Tracy inhabits. Not only is the city presented in an almost two-dimensional (and yet eye candy) format, it is painted with the primary colors. Yellow suits, green and purple cars, orangeish streets. The movie really looks fabulous. And the performances all around are quite good. Whenever he's not interacting with Madonna or Miss Headly, Warren Beatty is superb and buttoned-up in the role. The two ladies I mentioned also play their parts well, as does Mr. Korsmo. Mr. Pacino steals the show with his performance, and there are many other notable cameos by people such as Dick Van Dyke as the skeptical D.A. and Dustin Hoffman as the duplicitous Mumbles.""Dick Tracy"" has a lot going for it but that there just might be the problem. It has ambition. Perhaps too much, perhaps too little at the same time. Reportedly, there is a cut of the movie out there encompassing an additional twenty minutes. I hope it sees the light of day, for it just might contain the extra boost that this version that I saw really needs.",Dick Tracy
64,IonicBreezeMachine,"Stylistically a vibrant colorful take on The Untouchables by way of Robert Altman's Popeye, but fails to leave an impression.",5,15 December 2020,"Dick Tracy (Warren Beatty) is a tough no nonsense police detective who's the bane of the city's criminal underworld. Alphonse ""Big Boy"" Caprice (Al Pacino) makes his moves to consolidate power and build a criminal empire, but Tracy will stop at nothing to bring him down.Released in 1990 to mildly positive reviews and decent box office (though allegedly under performing depending on the reporting agency) Dick Tracy was often compared to the previous Summer's superhero blockbuster Batman. While there are certain superficial similarities to the Burton helmed production, the fact that the two films were in production roughly around the same time hints more at coincidence.The movie spiritually speaking has much more in common with Brian de Palma's The Untouchables adaptation than 1989's Batman. From the straight arrow protagonist to the over the top villain played by an actor from The Godfather (Al Pacino being this movie Robert de Niro) the movie is clearly trying to ape that particular framework while filtering it through the lens of a comic book art style. The movie is absolutely gorgeous to look at. From the make up, to the costumes, to the city itself, the movie takes a very stylized approach to its material with a color pallet inspired by the aesthetics of 1930s newspaper comic strips and a noticeable absence of earthy or industrial colors that give the sets a uniquely artificial look that's visual interesting. In many ways its usage of make up and set design is reminiscent of Robert Altman's usage when he made his adaptation of Popeye in 1980. But unfortunately the movie beneath its beautiful costumes, sets, and makeup is hollow and lacking in substance.The biggest issue with Dick Tracy is that despite an over the top design, everything is played very flatly (with the exception of one or two characters) Dick Tracy is a standard no nonsense cop (sort of Elliot Ness run through a funhouse mirror of exaggeration of his ""untouchable"" moniker), he has a standard love interest and a standard kid sidekick and none of the main characters in this movie feel memorable or engaging. Al Pacino appears to be having fun at least as the villain Big Boy, but a little of him goes a long way and his performance loses its novelty quickly (the fact Pacino got an Oscar nomination for this performance feels almost like a joke), Madonna is decent playing an exaggerated femme fatale, Breathless Mahoney, but like all the other roles in the movie it's a flat role that's only barely elevated by its performance.Dick Tracy isn't a bad movie and it clearly has ambition and craft at work, but it's also in the shadow of other comic book movies. It doesn't have the heart and character of something like Popeye, nor does it have the excess and camp appeal of something like Flash Gordon. The movie is almost worth watching for its sets and make up alone, but its such an inert and lifeless affair that I just can't recommend it.",Dick Tracy
65,gftbiloxi,"Great Designs, But Incredibly Static",5,8 April 2005,"Less than a decade earlier, Warren Beatty directed himself to considerable critical acclaim in the film REDS. But with 1990's DICK TRACY he stumbled badly: although it received considerable hype and numerous critical accolades for its art and sound design, the film fizzled at the box office, and these days you are more likely to find the film in a retail bargain bin than in some one's personal collection.Even so, DICK TRACY isn't as bad as its detractors often claim. The film has several things going for it, most particularly that deservedly lauded art design, which seeks to recreate the look and feel of ""golden age"" comic books. Built in largely primary color and with a tremendous sense of line, the designs are among the most striking of the 1990s. The make-up designs, which go to considerable length to recreate the look of the comic book characters, are also enjoyable.The film also has several memorable performances, and the most notable among these comes from someone who is has had little success on the big screen: Madonna. As femme fatale ""Breathless Mahoney,"" she looks good, has the best lines and delivers them with considerable spirit, and flawlessly performs the complex musical numbers specifically written for her by the legendary Stephen Sondheim. (""Sooner or Later"" may be single best thing she's done on film.) Glenne Headly, as Tracy's steady girl Tess, also makes an impression, as do many of the cameo performers, who range from Dustin Hoffman to Kathy Bates and from Estelle Parsons to James Caan.But for all its memorable visuals and the occasional outstanding performance, DICK TRACY is an incredibly static film. Although the art designers did a terrific job in capturing the look of comic book graphics, the cinematographer miscalculated in repeating the look in terms of camera setups, which are presented in a flat-frame style calculated to recreate comic book frames. The result is a host of beautiful images without any motion dynamic at all, and over the course of its run the film develops a static quality that I personally found absolutely exhausting.The script doesn't help very much either. The story finds our hero trying to put away Big Boy Caprice and being tempted away from Tess by Breathless in the process--and that's really all you can say about it one way or another. And with one or two exceptions aside, the dialogue is as uninspired as the plot. What with the camera locked down like the Rock of Gibraltar and the script dead in the water, it's hardly surprising that most of the performers reacted by offering performances so incredibly broad that most of their efforts feel acutely forced.I can understand why many people admire and even enjoy the film, but by the time the final credits rolled I myself was glad to see it go, and I'd recommend that you either borrow it or rent it before you go so far as to buy it. As for the DVD, the picture and sound quality are great, but there are no extras of any kind.Gary F. Taylor, aka GFT, Amazon Reviewer",Dick Tracy

It's a wonder to behold.As director/star/co-writer/producer, Beatty knows what works in a film and shows it here, taking a familiar American icon and re-creating him for a whole new era.  Still set in the '30s, ""Tracy"" has a kind of timeless quality like all good films do.  I've lost track of how many times I've watched ""Tracy"" and I still catch something new every time I do.The others are all top notch, starting with Pacino's Big Boy Caprice (a reminder that he can do comedy with the best of them), even Madonna's Breathless Mahoney is a relevation in that under the right environment, she can act (GASP!).  But there's still such themes touched on as the necessity of family, keeping true to one's self, good versus evil, even Machiavellian themes are explored.  Odd for a comic strip film, but hey, it works.All in all, ""Dick Tracy"" is a classic unto itself.  Compared with other films of this decade, it makes a strong statement.  It's a good, strong film that doesn't depend on blood, violence, profanity or nudity to make its point.  There's a lesson to be learned here.Ten stars.  Great Scott!",Dick Tracy
67,KnightsofNi11,"Quirky and campy, but actually works",7,20 August 2011,"I'm not at all familiar with the character of Dick Tracy, but what I can gather from Warren Beatty's colorful film, he was the subject of a very campy comic strip. He was a police detective who upheld the law in any situation as he chased down criminals and became the love interest of many a dame. In the film, Warren Beatty plays Tracy as he runs around the city trying to catch Big Boy Caprice, played by Al Pacino, and bring him and his vast gang of crooks to justice. Madonna plays Breatless Mahoney, a night club singer who is involved with Big Boy and constantly vies for Tracy's love, promising him information about the gang if she gets what she wants. This plot might not seem very original, and that's because it's not. But there is something strange and unique about Dick Tracy that, in a way, actually makes it work.Like I said, I'm not familiar with the character or the comic strip he is from, but I feel like Warren Beatty was trying to capture an extremely specific look with this film. This is obvious through the camera angles and the colors which they accentuate. Also, the look of the buildings is very cartoonish and the villains of the film are exaggerated in a very cartoonish manner. There are lots of prosthetics in the film for each and every gangster that gives all of them a very specific look. I found this annoying and stupid at first, but it eventually grew on me as I saw the direction that this film was going. This is in no way a dark film. It's very upbeat and plays up a very specific cartoon atmosphere. I think that the film really did, in the end, capture the look it was going for.Now, if there's one word to describe Dick Tracy, it's campy. This film is one big tongue-in-cheek camp adventure. Again, it was something I wasn't terribly fond of at first, but it eventually grew on me and by the end of the film I was pretty amused by the way the film worked. Overall this is really just a very strange film. It shoots for a very specific atmosphere with its look, its humor, and the level of its campiness. It isn't something that I'm going to be terribly fond of and overall this film doesn't do much for me. I imagine lots of feelings of nostalgia for those who were fans of the Dick Tracy comic strip, but for me this is just a strange and entertaining little flick that is unlike most films of this time period and genre. I think the film did what it wanted to do, so for that I have to give it a lot of credit. It's not something I would watch again, but it made for a fun hour and forty five minutes.",Dick Tracy

The only standing between Big Boy and his goal is Dick Tracy, the cop with the yellow hat and trench coat, who will stop at nothing to bring down Big Boy. The only one standing between the lantern jawed cop and wily gangster? The mysterious and elusive ""Blank"". Bright, colorful, briskly paced, cheerfully tongue in cheek adaptation of the old Dick Tracy property is an engaging mash up of the Untouchables and Adam West Batman, with Tracy as Elliot Ness and Big Boy as Al Capone. The entire cast has fun with their roles. Director Star Warren Beatty embraces Tracy's no nonsense attitude with the same straight laced yet winking gusto of the aforementioned Adam West as Batman while Al Pacino gleefully sends up his own Godfather Michael Corleone gangster image as Big Boy (his Godfather brother James Caan has a cameo as a rival gangster in an amusing nod to those earlier films). Madonna is appropriately glamorous as the seductive Breathless Mahoney while Glenn Headley shines in the understated role of Tracy's gal Tess Trueheart. The 9th highest grossing film of its year and said to be the highest grossing film of Warren Beatty's career, a sequel was sidelined by disputes over who owned the rights to the character (and supposedly whether or not coming in 9th was good enough or not), which was unfortunate, to say the least.

71,Isaac5855,One of the Better Comic Book Movies...,8,30 November 2005,"Bringing comic books to the screen is a rather recent trend in cinema but it looks like it is definitely here to stay and one of the best offerings of this genre was the 1990 version of DICK TRACY, Warren Beatty's colorful and smart re-thinking of the square-jawed comic book character. Beatty has mounted a beauty of a film here that is gorgeous to look at (the film won an Art Direction Oscar for its flawless and dazzling settings as well as for Costume Design). Beatty has also wisely chosen to underplay and let his huge, all-star cast shine in their various roles and above them all is Al Pacino, who walks away with the film effortlessly with his completely over the top but totally watchable performance as Big Boy Caprice, I don't think Pacino has ever been funnier on film and even received an Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actor for his efforts. Madonna also leaves an impression as Breathless Mahoney (one of my all time favorite movie character names)as do Paul Sorvino as Lips Manlin, and Mandy Patinkin as 88 Keys among others. Patinkin and Madonna give effective service to the songs by Broadway genius Stephen Sondheim (one of them, ""Sooner or Later"", also won an Oscar). Though fairly predictable, DICK TRACY is a colorful and entertaining ride through comic book land that is definitely worth a look. A treat for the eye and ear.",Dick Tracy

73,departed07,A childhood favorite of mine,10,21 June 2003,"With Batman (1989) being a hyped up comic book movie and the number one film of the year, why not make another big budget adaptation of a comic book? Warren Beatty is both the director and the star of the film in which he gets every aspect of the comic book right. The film has the detective going after nicknamed villains, seducing Tess Trueheart, trying to get a witness to testify against a kingpin, and having a sidekick at the same time.It's just usual work for Dick Tracy as he wears the same yellow raincoat suit day after day as he tries to go out with Tess Trueheart but is called on duty when they notify him that five gangsters have been shot and that the main person behind the mess is Big Boy Caprice (Al Pacino).In the film, we are introduced to Breathless Mahoney (Madonna), a singer and dancer who is a main squeeze to local crime boss Lips Manlis (Paul Sorvino), and Big Boy's crew kidnaps both characters when Big Boy himself wants to take over the Club Ritz that Lips owns. And he does by killing Lips and owning Breathless as his slave to teach the girls how to dance for the re-opening of the club.Also in the film, Dick Tracy takes in a young orphan called ""The Kid"" in which he considers him a son after Kid helps Tracy in a situation where the detective almost dies. He wants to keep him, but the law won't allow him to keep a local orphan without paperwork.I was surprised to see Madonna in a role where she was mysterious. But than again, she has always played the seducer in many roles with the exception of ""League of their Own"" and ""Evita,"" this is one of her best roles.""Dick Tracy"" comes to the screen with such an animated detail that it feels as if we were inside the comic strip itself with the beautiful setback of the bright sun gazing over the Chicago sky view, what makes the film special from watching it, is that the film is not as offensive for moviegoers; there is not a shout of profanity, nor is there any kind of violence that will leave kids in shock; ""Dick Tracy"" is not only one of the best comic book adaptation, but one of the most visionary aspects I've seen on screen.",Dick Tracy
74,Mort-31,Try and spot the stars!,8,31 December 2000,"That was great fun! I never read those Chester-Gould-comics but it's not necessary to know them. Maybe there were some inside jokes I didn't figure out but what the eye doesn't see the heart cannot grieve over. This is such an ironic, colourful film and the actors are good-humoured all together. The setting is similar to that in the Batman` movies, but not as dark and grey. Okay, the story is not so original but there is a plot (which is not self-evident) and a more or less surprising ending.With this movie, you could play an interesting game, if you watch it with friends. Don't watch the credits at the beginning and then look who's the fastest to find out who are the famous actors under their make-up!",Dick Tracy
75,Dockelektro,All those colors,9,11 August 2001,"If Dick Tracy was in black and white, the pope wouldn't be religious. Giving a new sense to the concept of color in a movie, we are offered an unique experience throughout a comic-strip world, and it's one of the few movies which succeeded in doing so, thanks to a serious script, good direction, great performances (Al Pacino is astonishing) and most importantly a powerful mix of cinematography, art direction and costume design. Using only primary colors, the experience is quite different from anything we have seen before. And there is also a quite successful hommage to all the gangster-movie genre, pratically extinct from modern cinema. Overall, I see this movie as a fresh attempt and a touch of originality to a cinema which relies more and more on the old and already-seen formulas. 7 out of 10.",Dick Tracy
76,ReelCheese,"Style, Little Subtance",6,3 July 2006,"Too much style and not enough substance. That sums up this 1990 effort, based faithfully on the popular comic strip about the no-nonsense private dick in the yellow trench coat and fedora. Director Warren Beatty is decent in the title role as Tracy deals with grotesque villains, a rambunctious young lad and the conflicting demands of the two loves of his life - girlfriend Tess Trueheart and his job. Things get even more complicated when he's framed for murder and attempts to unravel a conundrum set in motion by the mysterious Man With No Face.The worst thing about ""Dick Tracy"" - and it's not altogether an awful film - is that the plot is so non-cohesive. We simply go from one scenario to another without much thought or consequence. It plays more like a series of those old cliffhanger serials than an uninterrupted movie. And Madonna, as lounge singer Breathless Mahoney, is annoyingly trampy.In its defense, ""Dick Tracy"" has probably the greatest comic book feel of any film. Its use of color, makeup and musical interludes makes it at times amazing to watch. But none of it has the storyline to match. It's like the writers felt that bringing Tracy to the big screen (this was not long after ""Batman"" exploded into theaters) was enough. Get the detective on the screen and the rest will follow. It doesn't, but still, ""Dick Tracy"" has enough redeeming qualities to make it worth a rental on a slow night.",Dick Tracy

I didn't really enjoy it. Hell, I hardly knew what Dick Tracy was. Just some random fictional detective that turned into a video game? Well, today, my mother showed me the DVD and I watched it on another opeating system. It was the first DVD I tried on it, hoping for it to work. Well, a test DVD turned out to be a great DVD movie. The bright, colorful scenery and the New-York classic style it gave to us was amazing, and I really loved it.Dick Tracy is what I would like to call, a modern Sherlock-Holmes. He has the mob running on their knees, he can solve a case in minutes, and he's smart, and with the help of the Kid or Dick Tracy Jr., he was able to continue solving the case of Big Boy, and beat it.This is a great movie that I hope you'll enjoy.",Dick Tracy
79,talisencrw,One of Beatty's--and comic-books--most underrated pictures!,8,12 August 2016,"I'm heartily disappointed that this didn't produce sequels. If any fine actor/director of the period was perfect for the role of Dick Tracy, it was Beatty. He does very good work here. It's as if he took Tim Burton's template for 'Batman' and simply adjusted it for his comic-book picture. Madonna isn't bad here either, simply because she's pretending to be Marilyn Monroe, something she'd been wanting to do all of her career to that point. And the rogues gallery here is perhaps second in quality only to the aforementioned DC Caped Crusader. In retrospect, that perhaps was the picture's weakest link--no true criminal really dominated proceedings and stuck in one's mind. Had they tried the time-tested hookup of two baddies to get in Dick's hair just enough to rile him, it may have worked better. Still one of the most enjoyable, and underrated, comic-book pictures of the past three decades.",Dick Tracy

81,blakiepeterson,A Visual Extravaganza,10,16 June 2015,"Maximalist in its neon pleasures and a visual dream in its uncompromising vision, Dick Tracy is a comic book adaptation of unusual ambition. Rather than simply take stock characters and infamous plot lines from the pages of the strip and pray that an impression will be made by way of the silver screen, it attempts to fully realize every ocular atomic bomb the original frames shook the world with during its prime years. Prosthetics uglify the faces of villains, placing their tarnished psyches in full view; the cityscape, especially at night, glows with gaudy neon while advertisements and apartment lights act as pulp accents. The film is absolutely stunning, so photographically and stylistically original that I dare you not to stare at the lusty fantasy of it all without some sort of flabbergasted reaction.Upon release in 1990, Dick Tracy was surrounded by a hailstorm of pervasive media coverage, which heightened expectations to levels no film could ever match. Universal hoped it would be the next Batman, ultimately spending over $100 million on production, marketing, and promotion. Madonna, the most famous woman in the world at the time, decided to release a concept album based on the character she plays in the film, titled I'm Breathless (which features pop archetype ""Vogue""). So when Dick Tracy turned out to be an uncontrollably stylish foray into comic book lure, most were turned off by its spirited approach. They wanted a fun blockbuster but got a self-serious museum of noir-on-acid tropes.Twenty-five years later, without the noise of Universal's promotional moshing and the combination of the star power of Madonna and Warren Beatty, Dick Tracy isn't just an underrated blockbuster — it is also an artistic triumph, so completely intransigent in its determination to mimic the look and tone of its source that it finishes thrilling in its disregard for conformity. Whether you liked it or not, it is impossible to completely forget. Its images leave an imprint in the brain like Sin City or Waking Life, its attitude joyously foolhardy in its every step.Beatty portrays the titular protagonist with stoic morality — he is a detective without any other interests besides making the world a better place. Persnickety cynicism is left at the door. A hero of capable tenacity, he spends his days fighting crime, his nights with longtime sweetheart Tess Trueheart (Glenne Headly) and their may-as-well-be-adopted-son Kid (Charlie Korsmo). But Tracy's life is far from routine. Currently stalking the streets of the city are mob leader Big Boy Caprice (Al Pacino) and his many associates. They want to become crime gods, but Tracy, his usual heroic self, makes it nearly impossible for such dreamy successes to become reality. Using lounge singer Breathless Mahoney (Madonna) as a seductive pawn, the thugs plan to off him quickly and without evidence. But Tracy isn't one to wither away in the face of temptation.Dick Tracy's story is fairly standard, but so are the stories of all comic books. Like every work of pulp fiction, clichés are wrapped up so neatly in adventuresome style that we find ourselves lost in the good cop/bad cop dynamic, despite the fact that we've seen it all before. The only way clichés can work is if they exist in their own separate universe. There isn't anything special about a car chase set in a blasé, modern-day San Francisco, but when the act occurs in a wasteland of unwavering vision (a la Mad Max: Fury Road), everything becomes a surprise. Thanks to Beatty's decision to film Dick Tracy in pop-arted, artifice obsessed design, anything resembling a dime-a-dozen trope becomes new again.I could go on and on lauding Dick Tracy's style, but that would be an injustice to the actors. To survive in a film like this, a performer must put on a brave face and be willing to transform themselves into a caricature — here, the cast goes above and beyond, and that's an immensely difficult thing to do. As wooden (and too old for the part) as Beatty is, he fits the mold of Tracy quite well with his passive masculinity and unwillingness to go against his moral compass. But the film belongs to Pacino and Madonna, who don't walk but run with their parts, so infatuated with their roles that they fly from camp territory to convincingly authentic lands. As Big Boy Caprice, Pacino is loud, melodramatic, and fittingly moody; Madonna, in an impressive Marilyn impression, whispers her way through a role that requires her to do what she does best: sing and take on a compelling persona.In terms of style, Dick Tracy is a work of complete originality. In temperament, it reminds us why comic books have remained such a staple in popular culture; despite their artificial touch and exaggerated characters/settings, there is truth to be found amidst all the fakery. You either love Dick Tracy or you hate it. But even its biggest detractors can't deny how visionary Beatty's direction is.",Dick Tracy
82,honorhorror,Did we watch the same movie?,8,19 June 2009,"Heh, if I tell you to compare The Dark Knight with some 18-years-old comics-adapted movie rated 5.9, will you call me crazy? That's just to catch your attention. Everyday I meet people complaining there are no good movies, who seem to only know the recent blockbusters. It's never a bad thing to search and explore old movies, especially those with good artistic values. Dick Tracy is one of those can't be easily outdated, in terms of technology.The negative reviews mainly complained about DT's ""messed up"" story. But it appears to me that the storyline is quite clear, and I had no problem following it. I didn't see the comic books, yet I am not a huge US comic fan, but I appreciate the top-notch film-making and performances. Maybe the expectations of most people were too high about the story it would tell. But, if you see a movie casting Madonna and Warren Beatty together, what would you expect. I had some scratches on my head, and can't help but wonder, did we really see the same movie? The title role, although not as competent as it sounds, still was able to pull him up and charm the audiences. Madonna was more express-less than ""breathless"" in her seductive role, but added a lot of fun to the story. Al Pacino was funny and prodigy to himself. Apparently he's bold enough to go sarcastic on his previously successful roles. We can see a hybrid of Scarface, Michael Corleone, Adolf Hitler and Robert De Niro punching our stomaches to make us laugh. And many thanks to make-ups.To me it's not bad at all.

83,krycek19,How could this movie win any awards that wasn't Razzies?,1,26 April 2016,"The most embarrassing part of the film is Warren Beatty (53 years old!!!) at the time casting himself as Dick Tracy, a part that should have been played by an actor 20 years younger than him. Due to Botox and plastic surgery he has as little facial movement as the actors wearing heavy makeup or masks to look like comic book characters. And he can't act either, which is possibly because there is no-one to direct him. And despite how great looking he think he is, he looks old and tired. All the great actors in this movie (not counting the very old douche-bag Warren Beatty) are completely wasted here, because they're unrecognizable in their heavy makeup or masks.Apart from a funny Al Pacino) as the main villain ""Big Boy.And Dustin Hoffmann as Mumbles, that I didn't recognize until his second scene and in a closeup.Madonna is very sexy as Breathless Mahoney, but they would get better acting out of a chimp than her.As for the movie in general: the matte paintings and the stupid colors on the fake looking buildings that is suppose to look like a comic book city are not impressive. Especially not, thinking about Sin City, where this was done on a computer. And looked a 1000 times better. I know this movie was made 26 years ago, but it must have looked like crap even then.And what's the deal with making all the badguys look like comic book characters and only 5 actors in the movie looking like human beings? Either they all look like comic book characters or they all look like human beings.The movie is slow in pace and drags along and could easily have been half an hour shorter.There is zero chemistry between Warren Beatty and Madonna and Warren Beatty and Glenne Headly. Probably due to the old Beatty, playing opposite women that could be his daughters and Beattys inability to direct other actors.The kid playing Kid is okay.Overall a dull movie and the worst comicbook adaptation I have ever seen.Avoid this crap!!",Dick Tracy
84,dkncd,"""All's fair in love and business.""",10,23 September 2007,"""Dick Tracy"" is a film about the exploits of detective Dick Tracy, based on a comic series. While Dick Tracy is a detective, this film cannot be properly called a mystery film. There is only one major mystery in the film and that mystery is only a minor element of the story. ""Dick Tracy"" is better classified as a constant battle between Dick Tracy and a local mob, headed by Big Boy Caprice.The fictional city that is the setting of the film incorporates the technology and mob activities of 1930s Chicago and has scenes that are very colorful and an interesting mix of realistic and unrealistic backgrounds. Even the costumes and 1930s style cars are colorful, with Dick Tracy himself wearing yellow detective attire. This film features a great soundtrack by Danny Elfman and equally great original songs from Steven Sondheim, my favorite being ""Back in Business"".Warren Beatty delivers an interesting performance as Dick Tracy. Tracy is self-assured and even excessive in fighting crime, yet awkward when interacting with women. Glenne Headly is effective as Tracy's girlfriend, Tess Trueheart, and Madonna is appropriate as Breathless Mahoney. Charlie Korsmo should also be commended for a solid performance as ""The Kid"". The villains of this film only come in one shade: over-the-top, whether in appearance, performance or both. Al Pacino is in command of the mob as Big Boy Caprice, who cannot be taken seriously at any time for the film's duration. I greatly enjoyed his performance with his strange look and mannerisms, gruff voice and hilarious historical misquotations. The supporting villains are also notable, with Dustin Hoffman giving an amusing performance as Mumbles.The story has enough developments to keep the film interesting. Essentially the bulk of the film is like a game of chess where Tracy and Caprice make their moves to try and topple the other. The film also explores Tracy's relationship with Tess and his interactions with Breathless. Overall ""Dick Tracy"" is a successful adaptation of the popular comic series.",Dick Tracy
85,noizyme,"Great actors, direction, cinematography, and feel. Too original for some.",8,21 February 2005,"Dick Tracy was originally a comic book created in 1931 by Chester Gould. He is a plainclothes detective who tracks down a crew of villains, ranging from all types of visually original characters such as Flattop to The Blank to Big Boy Caprice. (These villains became so popular in the 40's that Warner Bros. created their own take on the Tracy-style villains in such cartoons as Daffy Duck) Tracy's comics were known for their liberal use of gunplay and the up-to-date technology advances (notably the wristwatch communicator), which got their fair share of screen time on this excellent movie. The music was done wonderfully by Danny Elfman, and the original songs by Madonna were interesting, but they were not the high point for her career. It's weird because as you watch the film and see the suspenseful moments, the film feels so much like Batman because of Elfman's memorable sound to his pieces.I love the tough-talking kid, Pacino's acting as Big Boy Caprice (and that chin!), Madonna's take on villainy, and the cinematography and directing were impeccable. This film was very professionally made and features tons of great actors who were known as great actors for a while before this film was made (Warren Beatty, Al Pacino, William Forsythe, Dustin Hoffman, Kathy Bates, Mandy Patinkin, Catherine O'Hara, Dick Van Dyke). The film was directed by Beatty himself, which was interesting. It is almost like Beatty saw himself as Tracy in a past life or something because he really fit the part.I had to give this film an 8/10 for everything that it brought to cinema that got overlooked (for whatever reason). There have been tons of misunderstandings over the rating of this movie on IMDb, and I still don't understand why. The characters were completely original and vibrant, as was the style of the sets, wardrobe, lighting, and everything in this film. Go buy it today. You will not be sorry.",Dick Tracy

A movie that comes with something new though an old version existed in 1945 but wasn't a success like this one. I have noticed that one of the viewers criticized the colors though this thing made so much contribution to the movie. The colors were purposfully intended to make you feel that this is not the real world we are watching but we are watching Dick Tracy's world. So much like Who Framed Roger Rabbit spirit but without the animation that steals you right away from reality. The makeup was genius for many people didn't know Al Pacino or Dustin Hofman without reading their names at the end. Acting is perfect with all the great names in.

87,Don-102,Beatty does Burton in lightweight comic book fashion...,8,6 March 1999,"Warren Beatty directed the 2nd entry into the comic book sweep of Hollywood around the late 80's and early 90's, starting with Tim Burton's BATMAN.  He had one singular vision: to make an overblown comic book film with his best buddies from the industry.  The movie is average at best, but the incredible art direction that went into the creation of Chester Gould's animated city elevates it a step higher.  The sharp yellows, reds, and greens are as much a character in the picture as the actors.  All analysis aside, this is purely escapist entertainment.  And Beatty and co. do it with tongue planted firmly in-cheek.Is it worth seeing? Yes, mostly because of the awe-inspiring look of the city and its vibrant colors.  Turn down the volume on the set, and you won't miss a thing (except Danny Elfman's great music).  The script has the depth of a high-school term paper: ""The enemy of the enemy is the enemy?!"" says Tracy.  Wow.  Is it worth seeing more than once?  Maybe twice, because you'll see things in this metropolis that will make you take a deep breath.It seems as though Beatty assembled the huge cast and told them to just go off, but many of the cameos go unnoticed.  The best is by Dustin Hoffman who plays 'Mumbles'.  I laughed out loud at least twice during his scenes. Madonna looks good and acts bad (surprise) and Pacino annoys and overacts (surprise) and was rewarded an Oscar nomination for the role of Big Boy Caprice, a sort of deformed Michael Corleone.  That's entertainment.  If you like old-fashioned flicks and grew up on comics, then you'll be entertained.",Dick Tracy
88,T-ZER0,Dick Tracy is a masterpiece,10,1 February 2020,"I remember first seeing this film with my dad. It came on Turner Classic Movies one day and it completely changed my life. I was introduced to this colorful world with interesting villains and cool heroes. I knew about the comics, but I loved the movie. This movie inspired me to make detective stories and comics.They got Danny Elfman to do the score, he had just come back from doing Batman 1989, so I don't think it was a hard transition. Warren Beatty directs this film as well as stars as the title character. Honestly, this is great. Warren Beatty has the look of Dick Tracy, and when he wears the costume you see it more.Al Pacino plays Big Boy Caprice, who is the main villain of this movie. He's a mixture of evil and comical. You can't help but laugh when you see him coach Breathless on that scene in the Club Ritz. Speaking of which Breathless Mahoney was played by Madonna. Which I admit is great, but the only problem I have was that her and Beatty were dating at the time. Here's the problem with that: Breathless has more screen time with Tracy than Tess Trueheart, who is Tracy's girlfriend. I'm not a Madonna fan, but I will give credit when it is due, she provides a great soundtrack, and I can buy the fact that she's Breathless.One of my favorite things about this movie is the city. Oh, that beautiful city. It's so dreamy to look at. If only movies nowadays did a city background like Dick Tracy. The city is a character on this film, it's gorgeous and gives the viewer a pleasant experience.Now to the Kid and Tess. I watch this film to remember Gleeane Headly. Because this was when I was introduced to her. She is a great actress, and I like that they got Charlie Korsmo to play the Kid, or ""Dick Tracy Jr."" I love the scene when he keeps asking. When do we eat? It's funny because all that food is coming out of Tracy's wallet!Flattop is my favorite Dick Tracy villain, and I like the casting for him in this film, even if he won't return for a sequel.You know what's better than streaming this film? Buying it on Blu-Ray! I own the Blu-ray Disc and it looks amazing on my PS4! We may get Dick Tracy 2, or we may not, either way, I'm glad this movie was made.

89,mcsheehey,A Lot of Fun,8,3 May 2007,"I will not under any circumstances even try to defend this film as a touching drama or an exciting thriller. However, it is still a ton of fun, and is packed full with great over-the-top performances, flashy musical numbers, and great production design.There are three things about ""Dick Tracy"" that make it such a fun movie.1. The snazzy production design and set decoration are fantastic. They make the movie look just like a living comic book strip, which is what Dick Tracy is and always was all about. The costumes, buildings, and makeup all spruce the actors and settings up as well. It's a bit strange, but it certainly works.2. Al Pacino. This is one of the best, funniest, and most over-the-top supporting performances of the 1990s. Al Pacino shows in this movie that he knows how to commit to any role, even the villainous and eccentric Big Boy Caprice. His lines, which are filled to the brim with false quotations and paradoxes, blend perfectly with his grandeur appearance and accent. No offense to Joe Pesci, but i think Pacino deserved to nab the big gold man for this one.3. The all-star cast of this movie makes it a formidable film indeed. Warren Beatty doesn't have to do much as the detective, and Dustin Hoffman's Mumbles is under-used, but does it really matter? The fact that these major names are in the film is still worth something. Even Madonna makes a competent appearance as the mysterious night club singer who tries to win Tracy over.This is a fun film, and is very enjoyable to watch for people of all ages. It's no ""Crash"", but it does what it does very well. Bravo.",Dick Tracy

Warren Beatty was ahead of the times and that means financial failure, but a visionary of the future nevertheless.Today, we are so concerned about CGI, rendering, fidelity of comic book adaptations, more so than the story itself. There's a simple explanation: most movie goers are mostly fans of the comic strips.For me when I first watched the story was bad, it was hard to follow the movie had few black holes that just makes you feel there is not much excitement. Story has far too many character. Technical excellence, terrible story.Most movies today are like that, no plot, no story, just video games. For example Doom was rated better than A Sound of Thunder. Doom has hardly any story line. In fact I can make the entire movie straight out of a shooting exercise from a computer video games.For anyone who will enjoy the story more than the effects needs a certain amount of concentration as to whether it provokes you to question, make you think, effects your thought, get you interested to look further, makes you wonder, shock you in someway having a lasting influence, and most of all, the desire to watch again and again. Seeing more to the story than the story itself. It will shake your life, change your outlook, gives you a new philosophy. Very few of the movies today does this anymore, such as of Casablanca, Gone with the Wind, Dr. Strangelove, One Who Flew Over the Coo Coos Nest, or even a fun movie like Young Frankenstein.",Dick Tracy
92,cwrdlylyn,DICK TRACY : Should Be Seen As An Example Of What A Comic Book Movie Should Be...,10,13 September 2006,"DICK TRACY Warren Beatty's 1991 adaptation of the classic Dick Tracy comic books has only improved with age. At the time of it's release, DICK TRACY's visual style was unlike anything the movies had seen and perhaps some of the public didn't know what to make of it. Beatty decided to have a color palette of just 7 crisp colors, the same colors that were available when the Dick Tracy comics were first published. By doing so, he has created a cinematic world that has the miraculous ability of never feeling dated. This is incredibly refreshing when you consider that fact that the continuous development of computer technology and special effects has caused so many great movies of the past to lose some of their magic over the years. Not the case with DICK TRACY.Warren Beatty has certainly proved himself over the years to be an incredible contributor to the art form of film with a resume including REDS, BUGSY, BONNIE & CLYDE and more. However, never before and never since has Beatty put out a film full of such nostalgic excitement and fun.Though there were many different comics and story lines regarding everyone's favorite cop Dick Tracy, Beatty managed to consolidate them all into one engrossing film. DICK TRACY begins with Big Boy Caprice (played by Al Pacino with a great deal of abandon and fun) starting to gather together all the city's gangsters for one unified deal. Together, all of them can rule the city.Big Boy's plan includes buying out the nightclub where Breathless Mahoney (played by Madonna, in perhaps her best performance) sings and then turning it into a den for underground gambling. Meanwhile, Dick Tracy and his ever-faithful girlfriend Tess Trueheart (Glenne Headley) have just taken under their wing a young orphan (an incredible Charlie Korsmo) with an endless appetite for food and action. As Dick Tracy tries to get to the bottom of Big Boy's plan, he sees his only link to getting to the truth is Breathless Mahoney... a woman who's not willing to help him until he shows interest in having her as his woman.The plot is simple, but it is more then compelling enough as a compliment to the incredible visual flair of Beatty's comic book adaptation. Everything including the special effects, make-up, costumes, music, and all the performances are perfectly suited to the film's tone. Everything has a comical cartoonish quality to it, including the dialogue, however everyone involved seems so aware of this quality that they've successfully embraced it and incorporated into their work.For such a unique film, it's amazing that all the pieces can come together and blend so wonderfully as a cohesive whole... but I suppose that's just a credit to Beatty's directing here. He has managed to literally bring the world of the Dick Tracy comic strips to life on screen in a manner that has only been matched by Robert Rodriguez's SIN CITY. They are two films very different in substance, however their ability to create a unique world so powerfully is unmatched by other comic adaptations.One of DICK TRACY's most entertaining qualities is the cast it has gathered together. The ensemble is a who's who of great actors even down to the smallest of roles (watch for Kathy Bates and Catherine O'Hara in ""blink & you miss them"" cameos). Everyone here is having fun without losing focus. Pacino's Big Boy is a thrillingly over-the-top bad guy opposite Beatty's cool and collected all-American hero. Also, the two leading females offer polar opposite performances of equal appeal. Madonna has never been so compelling in a role (aside from a refreshing performance in A LEAGUE OF THEIR OWN) and she embodies a Marilyn Monroe gone bad like no other could have. Glenne Headley is so engagingly sweet that you don't even notice how spineless she is... she's the epitome of ""damsel in distress"". And Charlie Korsmo as the kid offers one of the most brashly confident child performances captured on film in recent years.To top it off, DICK TRACY also features some incredible original music from Stephen Sondheim. Music plays a major role in DICK TRACY from the montages to the live performances, and yet it only enhances the film. DICK TRACY is just an example of all the elements adding up to make a great whole... and there's no single element that ruins it for the rest of them. This is a movie that made me feel like I was a kid again in awe of the new things that only film can show me. It's a shame DICK TRACY isn't more fondly remembered then it is... b/c for today's filmmaker this should be held up high as an example of what to aim for when creating a comic book adaptation....

93,Cyber256702000,Like Watching A Comic Book,6,6 May 2002,"Dick Tracy tries to stop a gang of hoodlums run by Big Boy Caprice.  A movie that is fun for adults and kids.  Dick Tracy is a very simple story with a massive amount of well know actors like Warren Beatty, Dick Van Dyke, Al Pacino, and Dustin Hoffman (although most are so unrecognizable due to the amazing make-up jobs in this movie).  This movie is a cool crime story that has such an artistic visual sense that it actually look like you are watching a comic book story.  Basically everything in the movie is a bright red, green, or yellow.  It is something that is very different and it actually works very well.  **1/2 out of ****",Dick Tracy
94,wilsonstuart-32346,A Noir With Florescent Splashes,7,2 October 2018,"Dick Tracy is an American newspaper comic strip that has been running for decades; a straight arrow, upright, epic jawline and a cool watch, DT was something of a rarity in Britain growing up - I think only the Daily Express ran the strip regularly.Warren Beatty's 1990 labour of love, brought the man with the yellow Mackintosh to vivid, brilliant life (I watched it on VHS about two years after its release). Strange, given the high production values, and star power - and the cast is impressive, practically a Godfather reunion! -that DT has fallen into such obscurity.Warren Beatty plays Tracy straight with a gleam in his eye; Al Pacino must have had a great time; kudos to Glenne Headly in a sweet turn; and I find Madonna's contribution quite interesting. At the time, her 
portrayal of Breathless Mahoney was praised as her best role since Desperately Seeking Susan - certainly an improvement on the ludicrous Body of Evidence a couple of years later! Those who criticise the cartoonish aspects of a movie based on a comic strip kind of miss the point! I'll take DT over the ridiculous, overblown Marvel nonsense anyday!",Dick Tracy
95,mgtbltp,Pulp Noir,8,13 July 2013,"Chester Gould's comic strip Dick Tracy brought to life in Pulp Noir a pastiche of comic strip/graphic novel, Poetic Realism, Pulp Fiction, and Film Noir. Beatty and Vittorio Storaro along with Art Direction by Harold Michelson, Set Decoration by Rick Simpson, the Buena Vista Visual Effects Group and Costume Design by Milena Canonero create an enjoyable fantasy world of late 30's early 40's Chicago in a pallet limited to the six main colors that the original comic strip appeared in: red, blue, yellow, green, orange, purple, plus black and white. Beatty's Tracy is a nice ""good guy"", always doing the right thing, tough and seemingly incorruptible, but as played by Beatty he is human, tempted determinedly by his femme fatale wanna be, Breathless Mahoney (Madonna). Glenne Headly plays Tess his long time sweetheart, the ""good"" girl. Charlie Korsmo plays tough street urchin ""Kid"", who is taken under Tracy's wing. Madonna's Breathess is stunning, she plays is Lip's Manlis's girlfriend/torch singer working his club, when Manlis is whacked she becomes the property of Big Boy Caprise mob boss. Caprise (Pacino) is not only an over the top mobster but a closet choreographer and in a hilarious segment he joins Breathless and the chorines on stage trying to spice up their new number.Some of the best sequences are of Breathless practically showing everything she's got while trying to work her womanly charms on a stoic Tracy.The diegetic music is great, the songs sung by Madonna by Sondheim, and the soundtrack music by Danny Elfman not really that memorable, maybe they will grow on me with repeated viewings. A fun film.",Dick Tracy
96,superboy478,A Comic Book Style,10,25 April 2002,"I saw Dick Tracy when I was very young. I didn't know who any of the actors were, and I didn't know the movie would turn out different than the way it was previewed. I sure loved it though.Warren Beatty stars as the crime-fighting 1930's detective Dick Tracy who goes after the biggest mob bosses in the city. This time, Big Boy Caprice (Al Pacino) has killed a very powerful man and is out to take over the city with his singer girlfriend Breathless Mahoney (Madonna) who has her eye on Tracy. It becomes even worse because a new criminal is invading and the worst part is: this criminal has no face. He or she is very unknown. Plus, the famous villians are back from the comic book collection.I thought that this movie was very colorful and creative. It was entertaining and fun to watch especially as a child. Warren Beaty was just like James Bond of the 1930's the way he played Dick Tracy.An ensemble cast of the film includes: Charlie Korsmo, Glenn Headly, William Forsythe, Dustin Hoffman, James Caan, Ed O' Ross, Tommy Lee Jones, Mandy Patinkin, Charles Durning.

But the visual look of the movie is distinct and cheeky, in a nicer way than I thought, though I was initially caught off guard by the legit comic book aesthetics of it. Beatty's direction is surprisingly energetic but hyper elevated by his calm performance in a world littered with make-up enhanced maniacs like Pacino as ""Caprice.""

101,mrtimlarabee,"Ambitious comic strip adaptation has a lot of look, spirit, but little else",5,13 December 2007,"Dick Tracy is a baffling movie. This is not because of its plot, which is fairly simplistic, or the characters, which play like the comic strip characters that inspired them. Rather its the pure ambition of the film that is puzzling.Dick Tracy was made after Batman, which was nothing short of a re-imagining of a comic book hero, removed from the confines of the colorful world of comic books. If Batman was an intent remove its hero from the comic book world, Dick Tracy sets out to celebrate it.The artistry of this film is original. It is not just merely an attempt to recreate a comic book world - it is one. The heroes' outfits are mixtures of all sorts of solid colors that look like their lifted straight from a painter's palette - Yellows, Greens, Oranges abound. There is no attempt to make the villains more realistic. They're here in classic form: Prune Face, Flat Top, Big Boy, Lips Manless. The comic feel is even captured in the films scenes, which each play like a 3-4 panel comic strip.This is where ambition becomes a bit much for a film to handle. While the attempt to capture the spirit of the comic is to be admired, the result is a rather awkwardly paced film. While there's never a dull moment, the action and resolution seem rather trivialized. The barrage of characters is overwhelming. Furthermore, the cardboard characterizations keep us from really caring about anyone. It becomes a rich looking spectacle, and nothing more.Complaints aside, it is well acted. Besides Al Pacino's pastiche of noir gangster types everywhere, there are a couple of supporting and one could even say cameo performances that are memorable. Notably, Dustin Hoffman as Mumbles. He provides for some comic relief late in the film. It's always nice to see Hoffman take a humorous turn, even if it is for a small part.",Dick Tracy
102,Dock-Ock,INCREDIBLE!!!!,10,18 June 2001,"Dick Tracy is a cinematic tour de force of excellent visualisations. The outstanding make-up marries itself superbly with the simply stunning set designs to accord us with in effect a living comic book. The plot is waifer thin, but as with Batman [1989] what matters is how the film looks, and unsurprisingly it looks fantastic. As well as all the above things you also have class performances from all the cast members. Warren Beatty's is now the definitve performance of Dick Tracy. After seeing Beatty it is hard to imagine Ralph Byrd and co in the role. Beatty also performs wonders with the stylish direction. Al Pacino comes across seriously in a comic role as the evil Big Boy Caprice, wonderfully hidden behind luxurious make up designs, and Maddona as Breathless is just fantastic. Stephen Sondhiem's songs add to the fun and above everthing is Danny Elfman's glorious themes. Excellent a winner. More Dick Tracy movies now please.",Dick Tracy
103,nived84,Still lookin' good after all these years,10,15 May 2006,"Dick Tracy is a wonderfully realized trip into a comic strip that stars Warren Beatty as the dedicated cop in the yellow coat, but Beatty doesn't just star as the lead, he's also the film's producer and director. Dick Tracy is filled with big names like Al Pacino, Dustin Hoffman, Madonna, Paul Sorvino and even James Cann, Kathy Bates and Dick Van Dyke in a couple of small roles. The film was produced by Art Linson and Barrie Osbourne, who also produced such films as Heat, Fight Club, The Matrix and The Lord of the Rings and features a smashing score from Danny Elfman who previously scored Tim Burton's Batman and later scored Sam Raimi's very comic bookish Darkman. Elfman is pretty much the ""go-to-guy"" for comic book movie scores, having also done two Batman films, two Spider-Man films and The Hulk.Beatty does a good job as Tracy, but the real marvel of acting has got to be Al Pacino, covered in make-up and supporting a back hump as Big Boy Caprice. He tears into the role and really chews it up, going wildly over-the-top; constantly yelling and shouting at everybody. The tone of the film seems like a slightly revamped old school style film-noir, using traditional yet exciting scene transitions, dramatic lighting and set designs. Which reminds me, if Stanley Kubrick had ever decided to do a comic book film I think this is what it might have looked like. Visually it's a great film. It's only sixteen years old, gosh has it really been that long? Boy I'm starting to feel kind of old. The look of the city is done in what I think must have been extensive matte paintings, or possible models, but I don't think the film used that many computer effects, because in the early nineties or possibly the late eighties (when this film was probably made) CGI wasn't quite that widely used, and was only made much more popular after Terminator 2.The film is about Dick Tracy's battle to keep the streets safe from gangster thugs and Big Boy who has made a move to become the city's biggest crimelord, while at the same time a night club singer known as Breathless Mahoney (only in the movies or comics are people called such crazy names) played by Madonna, tries to seduce Tracy, but all he wants from her is to testify in court against Big Boy, who has recently taken over the club she sings at. Then things get really complicated when Tracy's girlfriend, Tess Trueheart (again, only in the movies) is kidnapped and is framed for murdering the city's District Attorney, landing the cop in the slammer.Dick Tracy is a well acted, visually glamorous and stupendous movie-going experience that's a fun throw back to old film-noirs and jazzy detective yarns filled with blazing tommy guns and screeching tires. I loved it! And I wished they'd make more movies like it, but I guess in some ways you could argue that they are making a bit of a come back, like with last year's Sin City for example, but instead of splashes of color here and there, Dick Tracy is an overwhelming tidal wave of color, and it sweeps you up off your feet and away.",Dick Tracy
104,hedin_88,"its good, not perfect, but good",7,2 March 2008,"I saw the commercial for this movie, (not the trailer) and the narrator said how it got 3 Oscars. So, i said to my self that i have to see this one. And than it started and i see 'comic strip'. Now that made me interested. Todays comic-movies are not close to Oscars, and 3 of them definitely not. So, it started and i guessed right away that one of them must be for make-up. I mean, you car really see commitment and dedication to this area of the movie. You wont even recognize many of the famous names and faces (nowadays and then). By the time the movie goes and the story develops you see all the colors that creates a real comic-feeling. And there's the Oscar for Art directing. The third, i could not figure out until the end of the movie. I sat down and thought and i just jumped to my mind that it must be Music and guess what- it is. The many names make the movie a good one, the acting is in its place and the directing is nothing new, just the good old simple way of showing the movie. Madonna kinda spoiled it for me when she stopped singing and started 'acting' believe me, she cant act. I never read the comic but for those who have and who are fans, i bet you will love it and never loose the feeling that the movie is also very like the comic (art directing).From me, a 7 because im not a fan, just a satisfied viewer",Dick Tracy
105,mhoney-1,Brilliantly portrays the comic-strip feel,10,1 September 2003,"The opening credits make for a brilliant, atmospheric piece of escapist entertainment that's full of little nods to the comic strip. All the good guys are good, all the bad guys are bad, and the film is jam-packed with familiar character actors covered in gruesom make-up to hi-lite their characteristics.Warren Beatty, as Dick Tracy, is the ultimate tough guy straight man, incorruptable, calm usually, always a better fighter than the other guy, and rarely one to push the limit on legality. Al Pacino, as ""Big Boy"" Caprice steals every scene he's in as a hunch-backed gangster in some unnamed metropolis of 1930s gangsters. Maddonna plays the kind of person she'd probably play best, Breathless Mahoney, a nightclub singer and femme fatale with her own little agenda going. Gleanne Headly is Tracy's tough-talking, fiercely independent long-time girlfrined. And then there's The Kid, a funny little street urchin Tracy takes in, who models himself after his surrogate father, and saves Tracy when the detective has accepted his fate of being blown up.The supporting players are a Who's Who of character actors. Charles Durning is the chief of police. Dick Van Dyke is the District Attorney, who's bribed by Big Boy's goons to keep him on the streets. Dustin Hoffman has a humorous turn as Mumbles, the snitch whose dialect is so indecipherable the cops can't make head nor tail of what he has to say. R.G. Armstrong is Pruneface, one of the rival gangsters Big Boy forms a special allegiance to in order to create a network of crime spreading throughout the whole city. Mandy Patinkin is 88 Keys, the piano player for Breathless's show. Paul Sorvino plays Lips Manlis, Breathless's former benefactor until Big Boy gives him ""the Bath."" James Caan wears relatively little make-up in his performance as the only gangster who won't go along with Big Boy's grand plan. William Forsythe and Ed O'Ross are Big Boy's enforcers, Flattop and Itchy.This movie retains all of the corn of the comic strip, plus it is full of vibrant colors. Almost all the suits are elaborate in blues and greens and yellows and reds. All the colors of the rainbow are found in this movie--and then some! The matte paintings that are used truly realize this world as two-dimensional, only acted in three-dimensional sets. The humor is plentiful. Al Pacino fills the shoes of his character like no other character he's played before or since. Big Boy is kind of crazy, and kind of self-pitying. He's an eccentric little man who takes pride in quoting our Founding Fathers and likening himself to great political leaders. The man with the plan, always looking for the smartest way to do business.",Dick Tracy

I remember going out with my brother and we would ""play"" Dick Tracy with our toys and all the things that came out at that time. Good times. It also had the cliché storyline that was ""the good cop had to fight the bad guy and hes the only one that can"" story. I like movies, i love them, this was a movie, it didn't try to put out on of those deeper meanings they put out now days. This was a highly entertaining film that had a deep impact on me when i was a kid. I am almost 21 now and still like watching it, when will it be on a special DVD??? It had some of the most talented bunch of actors in it as well: Al Pacino, William Forsythe, Warren Beatty, Dustin Hoffman, Paul Sorvino People look to deep into things, saying it is 2 dimensional, but it was based off of a early comic strip that probably wasn't trying to give any inner meaning or whatever, they just wanted it to be entertaining and it was.",Dick Tracy
108,endymion82,A unique action movie with a lot of style,8,16 December 2000,"When this movie first came out I was 12 years old. I saw it six times in the theater- it was, in fact, the first movie I ever saw alone. Looking back, it definitely seems a lot better than it is, but having recently re-watched it, I think it still holds up and there's a lot about it I'm still impressed by. As action movies go, it's definitely unique, prioritizing plot and characters over explosions, but still maintaining a fast pace and some great chase sequences/gun fights. As far as performances go, I prefer Warren Beatty in those over anything else I've ever seen him in- the same is largely true of Al Pacino. Charlie Korsmo manages to be compelling instead of just cute- which is rare and wonderful in a child actor (too bad he grew up to be in CAN'T HARDLY WAIT). Glenne Heady gives a truly genuine performance as the long-suffering love interest and provides some emotional thrust to the movie. And then there is Madonna... frankly, along with Eva Peron, this seems to be a part she was born to play, and she does pull it off very well- she was definitely at the height of her sexiness in the early nineties (back when I was too young to really appreciate it). The major kudos for this film, however, go to the art director, whose use of only six colors for all the costumes and scenery is wonderful and very, very stylish. Also, big gold star to Stephen Sondheim for some wonderful,extremely witty songs, and Mandy Patinkin for his cameo as 88 Keyes, and his stunning duet with Madonna.",Dick Tracy
109,Dorkboss,"Film Noir, but with Color",6,24 September 2019,"Dick Tracy is based on the comic strip of the 1930's and both the director & the main character who plays yellow trench coat detective is Warren Beatty.The story tells that Tracy is a hard-boiled detective and his goal is to take down the massive crime of the city and his arch-nemesis named Big Boy wants to take out Tracy, Tracy then comes across a kid simply named... Kid, an attractive singer named Breathless Mahoney, and all sorts of weird and colorful characters, such as Flat Top, Babyface, the Blank & they want to take Tracy out.The story is pretty basic with the good guy going against the bad guy, kid sidekick, femme fatale and all the stuff you've seen in the classic film noir. But you're expecting any well-done execution from our characters, then you may want to look past this; everybody has that one personality and doesn't add much to it, Tracy is the tough cop and that's it, Breathless Mahoney is the attractive hot singer and that's it, and the wisecracking kid is just a wisecracking kid and I hope you understand where I'm going with this, the only actor that's given good performances with his character is Al Piceno. The only thing I do have fun seeing from the movie is that it has a colorful visual style and how the makeup effect looks cool and that it.Overall: While the movie can impress you with its art style and makeup, the story isn't interesting and the characters look like their distinct but never act like their district, if you just want to see the movie because of its style and you enjoy seeing the standard trench coat cop fighting bad guys, than you be glad you saw it, but if not, then their's no shame to skip this movie.",Dick Tracy

But I recommend you see it.,7,8 September 2013,"I avoided this movie for years because it looked like it was pretty bad ... and, having just watched it, it is ... but I recommend it.Overall it's not very good, but it has bits and pieces in it that are beautiful.There are city-scapes, flyover shots of the city they're in, which are very good. + The villain makeup is kind of annoying and distracting. I get what they were trying to do, capture the grotesque faces of Chester Gould's bad guys. But they just look like their faces are puffed up from some allergic reaction. - Some of the acting is very good. It's an incredible lineup of actors. Al Pacino does decently in a fairly typical Al Pacino bellowing and gesticulating role. Not a great acting stretch but loads of fun. + Madonna is stunning. Is she acting or playing herself? But I think she captures something in the character she created which is very unique, and stunningly bad-ass and good. The singing is good, especially at first. I got a little tired of musical numbers, but the first few really impressed me. The first especially. Madonna really showing some genuine talent. ++ Warren Beatty. I really can't stand Warren Beatty, at least since watching this movie. After seeing what they did with the villains, I expected they would at least make some nominal attempt to capture the look and personality of Dick Tracy.Nopes. Forget that. This is Warren Beatty. He is way too good-looking to bother doing anything in a movie but walk around looking good. It probably helps a lot that Beatty produced this, so he could guide the script and ensure it didn't involve anything he could do by just being Warren Beatty. There are relationship-tension scenes with his girlfriend that acknowledge the character a little, but they are still pretty much nothing but Warren Beatty being cute and adorably boyish. -------------------------------- So while I think this is not a very good movie, I still recommend seeing it for the really good parts suffocating to death within it.",Dick Tracy
112,tipplerunkus,"Fun, stylistically innovative, but sluggish and indulgent.",6,24 August 2003,"Warren Beatty's ""Dick Tracy"" is a stylistic triumph. Certainly, no one has ever quite so literally put a comic strip on screen. Vttorio Storaro's cinematography combines with strong costume and make up design for a look mesmerizes you at the same time it's distancing you from the characters.The fact the characters are cardboard cutouts with little personality (aside from the over-the-top cartoon villains) doesn't help you warm up to them, either. However, Beatty shouldn't really be criticized for this - after all, he's merely being true to the source material. A more interesting or charismatic Dick Tracy wouldn't really be Dick tracy, would he?The film's prinicpal weaknesses are it's somewhat sluggish pacing, and the over indulgence of Madonna's Breathless Mahoney character. The two elements go hand in hand: Countless musical montages showcasing Madonna's mediocre vocals (this was before ""Evita"" turned her into an actual singing talent) to Stephen Sondheim's catchy songs work at times (particularly the arrest montage to ""Sooner or Later""), but at other times slow down the action to the point of severe annoyance. Madonna's performance is by far the weakest in the film: While Beatty, Pacino and the others embody their characters perfectly, Madonna is never anything but Madonna, and she's never quite as sexy or appealing as she or the movie seem to think. It's hard not to imagine what this movie might have been with the in-her-prime Michelle Pfieffer crooning Breathless' torch songs.However, it should noted that these faults keep ""Dick Tracy"" from being a great movie, but certainly don't stop it from being a good one. Beatty's direction is impressive, for the most part, and he certainly created the feel he was going for. He also assembled one of the most impressive casts ever to grace a comic book film. Most of the actors seem to be having fun, and most of the time, the viewer will, too. But the sluggish pacing, lack of wit (except for a few lines from Pacino which feel like ad libs) and the distracting prescence of Madonna keep it from equalling the very best films of the comic book genre. Beatty deserves an A for effort.",Dick Tracy
113,d-j-dekok,A great lot of fun for all involved--and WHAT A SOUNDTRACK!,8,19 August 2013,"I have to confess, I was a fan of Dick Tracy comics back in the day and when word of the movie came out I went to the theater the first weekend. I was not disappointed. Relationships in the story went far deeper than the newspaper on which they were originally printed. The costumes, the gaudy colors, the hard-boiled title character and villains, all made for an unforgettable movie experience. Was this Kurosawa or Fellini? Of course not, but who cares? I had FUN at the movies, and nearly 25 years later I still enjoy it.The music gets its own paragraph (and should have its own review). The forces that came together to create this masterpiece are nothing short of miraculous. The score by Danny Elfman was spot-on deadly fun. The songs by Stephen Sondheim served not only to entertain at the club but moved and commented on the story in a way that only Sondheim could do it. The background music is performed by a rogue's gallery of singers and for the most part it works wonderfully. Frank Loesser's ""Two Sleepy People"" is given a charming treatment by Art Garfunkel. ""The Confidence Man"" is brassy, brash and bold in Patti Austin's capable hands. Even Jerry Lee Lewis gets in on the fun with an old-timey cover of ""it was the whiskey talking', not me"". According to the liner notes on the soundtrack he liked the song so much that he recorded two versions--the one in the movie, and one up-tempo more akin to what his fans know. It is telling that a lot of music written for the film didn't make it into the final cut, but survives in the Soundtrack recording, and in a third recording made by Madonna.

114,danindenver,A work of art.,9,16 September 2000,"I used to read the more modern Dick Tracy strip as a kid in the 60's.  It was the only serious Sci-Fi series available at the time.  For the transition to the big screen, the rough edges were smoothed out and the technology simplified.  The drama and excitement of a movie of the period were drawn out quite well.  I believe that the best films require a good visual feel as well as engaging theme music that is synchronized to the plot and to the action. 
This film fulfills these requirements and provides likable characters - both good and bad characters that you care about.  I marvelled at the elegant use of the comic strip colors and I enjoyed the music.  It was a pleasure to become absorbed in the story while enjoying this work of art.",Dick Tracy
115,r_j_t_kelly,Richard Sylbert - Design God,10,16 August 2006,"When they write the history of 20th Century cinema design, Richard Sylbert will be up there with Ken Adam, Scarfiotti, Beaton and Richard Day as the untouchables. This is a stunning film: an absolutely brilliant comic book adaptation, wherein the saturated colours, magnificent cinematography and spot-on performances (including that rare thing, a very good Madonna performance) coalesce into something pacey, fun and accomplished. Sets aside, the prosthetics used to transform such crime icons as James Caan, Al Pacino and Dustin Hoffman into hideous gargoyles of the comic book world are staggeringly good: enough remains of the actor beneath the mask for it to be a performance, rather than a voice-over. It's an absolute joy to watch - and a key film for anyone who's interested in the achievements in design (or who may have enjoyed the recent, accomplished but inferior ""Sin City"").",Dick Tracy
116,Merciful_Wolf,Fantastic entertainment,8,1 November 2009,"The low rating here really astounds me -- 5.9/10, really, people? It is a well-paced, well-acted film with a fantastic visual sense, epically recreating the kind of comic-book noir metropolis that has simmered and fermented for so long in American mythology, from the old Dashiell Hammett/Raymond Chandler classics of ""The Maltese Falcon"" and ""The Big Sleep"" (not to mention the Dick Tracy comics themselves) to modern sci-fi and neo-noirs like ""Blade Runner"" and ""The Dark Knight."" Here it comes to a full-flowering in all its pulpy glory -- like Roger Ebert said, ""It's the distillation of the idea of City - of the vast, brooding, mysterious metropolis spreading in all directions forever, concealing millions of lives and secrets."" It doesn't look ""real""...it looks magnificent.There has always been a close connection between the private eyes of hard-boiled detective fiction and the classic superheroes. The settings -- squalid, over-packed and decaying metropolises in need of redemption, the lone hero trying to do right in a corrupt world (often fighting himself), the twisted and often ideological evil of the criminals. And so much more. ""Dick Tracy"" gets that connection, making its villains so bizarre and vitriolic that they give the Joker a run for his money, and so resolutely squaring Tracy's own jaw that he could pose quite favourably beside Superman and Batman.For the most part, the casting and acting is on the money. Beatty cuts a perfect detective profile, and may be one of few men who can pull off a bright yellow trench coat. Pacino's overacting is virtually mandated by the extremity of this comic genre, and while his makeup is grotesque, it does fit the standards of the movie and his character. This story is a parable, a bit of American mythology in which those representing Good must be boldly and attractively so, and those that represent Evil must be decidedly ugly. There is nothing wrong with this -- shades of moral gray would be inappropriate for this tale. It is about archetypes, the importance of high moral ideals (or if philosophers prefer to distinguish, ethical ideals), and that it is a good thing to remind ourselves and be inspired to continue to fight for what is Good in spite of how hard it is.The one element that did not mesh well for me was the character of Breathless Mahoney, played by Madonna. She was trying too hard to evoke Marilyn Monroe and apparently forgot to create a character of her own. Her lines, both the actual dialogue and her delivery, are painfully forced, trying to twist every comment into dirty innuendo, and it simply doesn't work. Jessica Rabbit from ""Who Framed Roger Rabbit"" would've worked better in this role, and she's a cartoon!Nonetheless, this is great entertainment. Perhaps not too deep, but not without a message in the solidity of its traditional archetypes -- a Good versus Evil story of the old type which is actually rather lacking nowadays. Where the Good Guys are actually really good, and not swearing/promiscuous/brutal ""anti-heroes,"" and the Bad Guys have actually chosen evil ways and are not just poor ""misunderstood"" boys who need a big hug. We are meant to strive for being actually, truly Good, and are meant to look inward, monitoring our own thoughts and actions to keep us from the ugliness so transparent in the movie's personifications of Vice.",Dick Tracy

118,Diaboliqa666,Bloody Brilliant,10,3 March 2005,"This movies is the best movie to watch for comic book feel. The sets, costumes and the color are just so vivid it is just like stepping into a comic book. This is the movie I think of when the Mob is mentioned, the suits, the hats and the attitudes.Hoffman gives comic relief as Mumbles and you can't help but feel sorry for Madonna as she tries, and fails, to win Tracy over. This movie contains all the classic mob clichés - burying people in concrete, blowing up peoples cars, tieing up the good guy and attempting to blow up his girlfriends house.This movie is a classic in ever sense of the word, even camera angels cry out comic book. Its so great to be able to go back to an older movie and see that someone knew how a comic should be made into a movie after seeing such mistakes as Spawn and the Hulk. !!!YOU HAVE TO SEE THIS MOVIE!!!!",Dick Tracy
119,Marty L.,Homage to Classic Cinema,9,18 September 1998,"Warren Beatty's ""Dick Tracy"" is not just a tribute to the famous comic strip, it is an homage to the great film tradition of the past.""Dick Tracy"" benefits from three vital components:  Beautiful, smart cinematography, a terrific Danny Elfman score, and strong acting performances.  Al Pacino has finally found a role where his hammy overacting is warranted in the role of Big Boy Caprice.  Warren Beatty serves Tracy in good stead, Madonna is sufficiently steamy as Breathless Mahoney, and Glen Headly shines in perhaps the best performance of the movie.  Her Tess Trueheart is the perfect foil for Tracy and the antithesis of Breathless. Headly gives a funny and very subtle performance.  Just watch her face closely, every frown, every twitched eyebrow serves as a window into her character's emotions.  Cameo performances by Paul Sorvino, Dustin Hoffman, and Kathy Bates among others are hilarious.The lasting power of ""Dick Tracy"" lies in the cinematography.  The use of primary colors creates a cartoon world, and by using this very striking color canvas, it gives the movie a look which is, paradoxically, similar to the classic black and white detective stories of the 40's.  The use of soft lenses and familiar noir backdrops adds to this effect.At it's heart, Dick Tracy is a classic romance; you can almost see Humphrey Bogart as Tracy and Lauren Bacall as Breathless.  This romanticism is enhanced by a score which ranks as one of Elfman's finest.I would recommend this movie all sorts of movie-viewers: those looking for action, romance, comedy, and those looking for technical genius which is balanced by superb acting.  And after you've seen it, watch it again, you might catch something you missed!",Dick Tracy

The low rating is baffling to me.One of my favorite childhood films. The lines in this movie are gold! Al Pacino knocks it out of the park (like always), Madonna actually has acting chops.

121,robert_montana,No Special Features,8,10 September 2009,"I remember being intrigued by this movie when it first came out (when I was young and had not seen it yet). So I bought the DVD, saw it a few times and my verdict is in. I'm impressed with the effort put into it, such as the cartoon-like cinematography, art direction, legendary music by Sondheim, and all those cool cameos in the film (check the cast listing). Al Pacino did a good job as Big Boy Caprice and his Oscar nomination for supporting actor is well deserved. Although Beatty's performance as Dick Tracy is a bit dry, I believe the part called for it, the same goes for most of the characters. There is not much character development here with only one exception. This exception being the Kid (Charlie Korsmo), who starts out as a homeless-orphan-street-thief, but ends up being taken under Tracy's wing and becoming Tracy's sidekick. Korsmo acting seemed authentic, and some of the most emotional scenes in the movie are between him and Tracy. Such as when the Kid receives an honorary badge for saving Tracy's life, and when he chooses Dick Tracy Jr. for a name. Madonna looks really beautiful (perhaps the best she has ever looked on film) and does a decent job as Breathless, but her best parts are when she sings or her one-liners (but again I think the part called for it). Also I was pleasantly surprised that Madonna actually has two roles in the film (you would have to see to find out). Overall, though I was intrigued by the movie as a youngster, I must say that despite the considerable effort put into the film, I feel that it lacks charm and intrigue. But again for the third time think the comic strip origins of the movie called for it, and because of this it may leave viewers without any afterthoughts, and what adds to this is the fact that there is no special features at all on the DVD!",Dick Tracy
122,rjtrules,Pure Dick Tracy Nostalgia,9,13 January 2008,"I thoroughly enjoyed this true to form take on the Dick Tracy persona. This is a well done product that used modern technology to craft a imagery filled comic era story. If you are a fan of or recently watched some of the old Dick Tracy b&w movies then you're sure to get a kick out of this rendition. The pastel colors and larger than life characters rendered in a painstakingly authentic take on an era gone by is entertainment as it's meant to be. I personally find Madonna's musical element to be a major part of this film-the CD featuring her music from this movie is one I've listened to often over the years, it's just so well done and performed musically and tuned to that era. In my mind, Madonna's finest moment both on-screen but especially musically. This is sure to bring out the ""kid"" in you.",Dick Tracy

125,mpact75,A town this tough needs a cop this tough.,10,15 June 2002,"Dick Tracy is one of my all time favorite films.  I must admit to those that haven't seen it.  You will either really love it or really hate it.  It came out a year after the success of Batman.  So everyone's expectations were so high that many were let down simply because the plot is so simple.  But its based on a comic strip...what did you expect?  Creatively, this movie is amazing!  The sets, make-up, music, costumes, and the impressive acting make this film fantastic. The film has bloodless violence and no bad language - that's something rare these days.  Directed, produced, and stars Warren Beatty as the ace crime fighter going up against Al Pacino's evil Big Boy Caprice and his mob of thugs. Madonna steals the show as the seductive Breathless Mahoney. This is one of the best characters Madonna has ever played.  She has the best one liners I've heard!  Madonna fans would love it! One of the coolest things about the film is that they only used seven colors to make it look like a comic strip. This film is truly a piece of artwork that is sadly overlooked by the public.  To sum things up, this film brings out the child in all of us.  It's a film that will leave you smiling at the end.",Dick Tracy
126,texasthunderhawk,Sorely Underrated Comic Book Adaptation,8,9 May 2008,"With all the emphasis on the big bang CGI spectaculars of today's comic book movies, it's easy to forget what a great movie Dick Tracy is when listing the great comic book movies. While I love the eye-popping special effects as much as the next person, it's also important to have a great story...something Dick Tracy has in spades.For the uninitiated, Dick Tracy is a comic book that pre-dates even Batman and Superman, having made his debut in 1931. The ""cops and robbers"" storyline is based off of creator Chester Gould's experiences living in Chicago during the Roaring 20's. In fact, the heroic gang buster Tracy is partially based on the legendary Eliot Ness and Tracy's chief adversary, Al ""Big Boy"" Caprice, was based on the infamous Al Capone. What set the comic apart (and Warren Beatty faithfully recreates)was it's pulp crime thriller story lines with some basis in reality. Unlike Batman, Superman, and Spider-Man, Tracy rarely faced the same foe twice. As in reality, most of Tracy's villains either: A. Were arrested and went to prison for life. B. Were killed in a gunfight with Tracy. OR C. Died some twisted and/or ironic death befitting their character. It's gripping tales, strange villains, and exciting pace has made it a mainstay of the Sunday morning comics.In the film, Warren Beatty stars, produces, and directs this exciting adaption of the comic. In the title role, Beatty's terrific. Channeling his inner-Humphrey Bogart, Beatty gives a dead-on portrayal of the tough and morally indestructible hero, tempering the character with the right balance of human faults to make you root for him.Since there's no clear-cut ""epic"" story in the Tracy mythos, the story plays like a recreation of 1930's gangland wars with a heightened sense of reality. Al ""Big Boy"" Caprice (Al Pacino) is a brutal and ambitious crime boss looking to form an organized crime syndicate with other villains from the legendary ""Rogues' Gallery"" including the trigger-happy Flattop (type-cast villain, William Forsythe), the scratch-happy Itchy (Ed O'Ross from ""Six Feet Under""), the appropriately named Mumbles (Beatty's ""Ishtar"" co-star Dustin Hoffman), the intimidating Influence (veteran character actor Henry Silva), and the sour Pruneface (veteran R.G. Armstrong), along with others. But there's only one thing standing in his way in Big Boy's quest to control the city: Dick Tracy.But Tracy has problems of his own. Despite his toughness, Tracy can't even muster the courage to propose to his sweetheart Tess Trueheart (Glenne Headly). He has to look after a street urchin called ""The Kid"" (Charlie Korimso). And fend off the sexual advances of Big Boy's night club siren, Breathless Mahoney (Madonna, spoofing her ""Material Girl"" persona). Add to that a mysterious, not to mention FACELESS, foe who's helping Tracy fight the bad guys one minute and setting him up the next moment.The movie, despite the depth of plot, moves fairly quickly with an energy that never wanes one bit. From a visual standpoint, the vivid color schemes are used to give the film it's comic book feel, which a touch of film noir undertones. Danny Elfman's score (as good as anything John Williams has done) really drives the piece. And the All-star cast which also includes Paul Sorvino, James Caan, Charles Durning, Dick Van Dyke, and ""Bonnie & Clyde"" alums Michael J. Pollard and Estelle Parsons, elevate the film's integrity, making it a must see for any true comic book fan wondering what comics were like BEFORE the tidal wave of super heroes flooded the scene.",Dick Tracy
127,Hurdy_Gurdy_Man,Entertaining.,7,27 April 2013,"Warren Beatty directs and stars in the first colour live-action adaptation of the iconic comic strip. Most characters find a place in the film, some of the villains having substantial amount of screen time roles like Big Boy Caprice, Flattop, Itchy and Pruneface, while some others like Little Face and Johnny Ramm make fleeting appearances. The cast is solid all around - Beatty, Pacino, Madonna, Glen Headly, Dustin Hoffman, William Forsythe, R.G. Armstrong, Charles Durning, Seymour Cassel, Mandy Patinkin, Paul Sorvino and Dick van Dyke. James Caan shows up in a great cameo as a bitter rival of Pacino's, plus Estelle Parsons is there as well and I was surprised to see Kathy Bates in a blink-and-miss bit part.Many people dislike this one because it is 'cheesy'. I will admit that its sense of perfect good against complete evil is old-fashioned but it is based on a comic strip which originated in the crime-ridden 1930s, after all. For what it is, it is decent entertainment. The plot starts to come unravelled in the third act, since the storyline with ""The Blank"" and the twist about his identity makes little sense. A lot of footage Beatty had shot could not find its way in the theatres, maybe it contributed towards making the twist clearer. If the footage exists I would like to see a Director's cut some time. The film also features some excellent montages mostly set to songs.Beatty is alright in the role, a bit stiff, but his character is of a one-dimensional good guy so I guess he couldn't do much. Charlie Korsmo does a decent job as well, there is a very nice emotional scene with both of them towards the climax, which was a surprising change from the tongue-in-cheek mood of the film till that point. Al Pacino as Big Boy Caprice has the best role in the film, and he pantomimes his way through it in truly theatrical style. He is like a powder keg and goes completely bonkers in the end in spectacular fashion. Dustin Hoffman is also hilarious as Mumbles, I wish there were more scenes with him, his role in Big Boy's gang is not defined at all. The best appeal the film boasts of is its visual aesthetic, high on bright primary colours, impeccably framed by the Italian legend Vittorio Storaro. Madonna's poor performance and the weird final twist are the only major drawbacks.",Dick Tracy
128,Altern8guy,D is for DISSAPOINTING,6,9 February 2000,"I had high expectations for Dick Tracy but was let down in a big way.  The plot was thin and the acting below average.  The casting team bombed. Warren Beatty as Dick Tracy?  And what about Charlie Korsmo as the Kid? Both awful.  Al Pacino was the only actor that was able to flesh out his character.  Mandy Patinkin and Dustin Hoffman were pretty good also but hardly seen in the film for it to matter. As for Ms Madonna - try again, girl. One good thing - cinematography.  Excellent use of colors.",Dick Tracy
129,Delta Matt,"A few minor glitches, but otherwise superb.",9,12 February 2006,"At the time of writing, the rating for this film on the IMDb is 5.7 out of 10 stars. How is this possible, for a film that was nominated for 7 Oscars and won 3 - the second highest scoring film in the 1991 Oscars? There seems to have been some kind of curse placed upon ""Dick Tracy"". Whilst it was financially successful, got several rave reviews and is generally acknowledged as one of the best looking films of all time, its' reputation seems to have decreased through the years. When telling a friend that there was news of a possible sequel, he replied ""a sequel to Dick Tracy? Didn't everyone hate that film?"" Where it's got this negative reputation from, I don't know. As far as I can see, ""Dick Tracy"" is a perfectly sound film.The acting is in all places fine, and in some places brilliant. The most often highlighted performance in ""Dick Tracy"" comes from (not-surprisingly) Al Pacino in his role as crime boss ""Big Boy"" Caprice (earning him his 6th Oscar nomination), who is obviously enjoying himself in his first real departure from complete drama. Glenne Headly makes a great addition to the cast is her role as the long-suffering girlfriend Tess Trueheart - and is highly admirable, considering this was her first ""blockbuster"" role. Whilst both Warren Beatty himself and Madonna in their respective roles might not be worthy of any awards, they certainly do not perform terribly - indeed, Warren Beatty does a good job of bringing a two dimensional cartoon character to life, considering the said character was not really treated to the same broad characterisation in his paper form as Batman, Superman, The X-Men etc. were treated to before films were made about them.The look of ""Dick Tracy"" is immense. Lighting, production-design, cinematography, costume design, make-up; all departments were near perfect. It's becoming a bit of a cliché to say that the look of ""Sin City"" is quite close to ""Dick Tracy"", yet it is quite true; ""Sin City"" being heralded as an icon in film imagery. In particular, cinematographer Vitorio Storaro should feel aggrieved that he did not receive more recognition for his work.The music of ""Dick Tracy"" is well documented. Indeed, much effort seems to have been put into making sure the music was a success - the hiring of veteran composer Stephen Sondheim to compose the musical numbers, and an undoubtedly good singer to perform them in the form of Madonna. Yet another underrated aspect of the film is Danny Elfman's score - its Gershwinian influences immersing the audience in the 1930s. In particular, the recurring four note theme used to signify the presence of the film's amoral gangster-cum-vigilante ""The Blank"" is particularly chilling, mysterious and (to a 7 year old child, the age I first was when I saw ""Dick Tracy"") terrifying.Perhaps the one area in which the film lacks is the writing. While I feel that the plot is suitably fun and complex, the execution of writing this plot by script-writers Jim Cash and Jack Epps Jr. is a little laboured at times. The films sub-plot, leading to the film's ""surprise twist"" at the end has major problems; the two writers seem not to sure about whether they are supposed to be making said twist a surprise or blindingly obvious for the vast majority of the film.Having said that, I have seen this film countless times and have enjoyed the experience on each occasion. How ""Dick Tracy"" has secured its' dubious reputation as a film is a mystery to me. I would recommend at least giving it one try.And for God's sake, let's have more than a token DVD release, please!",Dick Tracy
130,djdamato,a good teen crime story,5,23 January 2002,I thought this movie had a great cast and it had a good story to it.  I think that it is a unique way to look at this time period which makes it original from most movies about that time.  I thought it was an okay story but nothing spectacular.  Very comparable to some of the followup movies to Batman.  I think that it sort of has a superhero quality in a movie about crime fighting with no superhero talents.  A crime movie that fits a young teen audience very well.  Visit themoviecritique.com for more of my reviews and many other things about movies.,Dick Tracy
131,nial_caroline,one of the best looking films ever made,8,24 September 2010,Dick tracy is based of the popular comic book strip from the 1940's. I never actually had read any of the comics before but i decided to give this 1990 film a watch. The movie stars Warren Beatty (who also directs)as the yellow coat wearing detective known as Dick Tracy. In his colorful city of his he beats the bad guys like every comic book hero. His main focus is on the crime boss Big Boy played by Al Pacino. Meanwhile he takes in a street urchin and has a romantic interest in one of Big Boy's girls played by Madonna. The movie is fantastic to look at. It's all extremely colourful and surreal. The other thing i would like to add is that the makeup is really weird (as some of the characters have strange facial features). However the look does distract from the story and the acting. The story is generally your typical comic book flick. The acting is good for the most part Al Pacino in particurlar who got nominated for an Oscar for this role. However Beatty is too old for Tracy and acts very blandly in this film Overall this is an entertaining flick,Dick Tracy
132,dashfashion,Holds up to the personal test of time....,9,3 November 2005,"I give this movie a nine out of ten. It is one of the best superhero/comic book movies ever made, and do you know why? Because it recognises - unlike a great deal of other comic book films - that it needed to be a fantasy. Not for one moment did I believe that the world it created was real and living, but in the basic terms of fantasy it achieves exactly what it set out to achieve.I think this is to the detriment of Tim Burton's original ""Batman"" which I also saw again recently and thought it has aged really poorly. ""Batman Begins"" is the definitive Batman because it recognised that Batman needed to act like it was based in reality. Dick Tracy doesn't and Warren Beatty takes full advantage of this simple, direct, straightforward material, hamming it up almost to the point of satire.I say this in terms of all aspects of its direction. The writing is basic and somewhat comedic, the acting is so in-your-face it's like an ensemble realisation of what Jack Nicholson's Joker should have been (Al Pacino in this movie kicks Jack Nicholson's arse!!!!), the design, while much maligned by some, is so crucial to the feel of the film that I can't imagine it any other way. The ""man with no face"" pastiche was going a little far, but at least that one had an explanation.Overall, I strongly recommend this film. It works on repeated viewings although I can imagine it being more useful to a film class than to the general public or to the families that it was intended for. It's such an obvious piece of Pop Art that it doesn't warrant the kinds of tactile thrills of a ""Spider-Man 2"" or a ""Batman Begins"", also among the best superhero movies ever made. But as a fantasy, this ranks with ""The Wizard of Oz"" or ""Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory"". And I'll say this: It's the movie ""Batman"" wasn't, but ""Batman"" was the movie that got the attention this deserved.",Dick Tracy
133,seanster,Eat this unholy coat of darkness,1,14 August 2001,"When people ask me whats the worst movie I've ever seen its this one.  Its not even close to MST3k level riffing, or midnight viewing at a theatre, or even as Disney channel late night filler.  The only time I've ever wanted to jump off a ride at Disney World (or Disney/MGM Studios in this case) was to grab Dick Tracey's jacket off the mannequin, rip it to shreds, and ram it down the tour guides throat saying ""Eat this!  Eat this unholy coat of darkness!!!""  I've never been so mad at a movie, not even ""Nutty Professor II: The Klumps"" or ""Flash Gordon"".  You want pretty colors and cinematography?  Ain't here babe.  Reviewers keep saying ""oh, but its too look like a comic book"", well, to me, its the color of a Gordito after several weeks in the sun.  About as enjoyable too.  Beatty wanders around this landscape jumping around and talking to his watch, himself, and occasional at the other actors, hoping someone will tell him what time the sequel will begin shooting.

134,sendmystuffhere,Comic book style flare with God Father'esque action,8,22 November 2020,"The word that best describes Dick Tracy, underrated. The movie bares similar characteristics to 1989's summer blockbuster, Batman. Anyone who's familiar with both films can easily see the similarities.Unfortunately, Dick Tracy was stuck in that limbo where it was too adult themed for younger children and yet too cartoonish for most adults. It tried to capitalize on that same balance of action, storytelling and comic book lore that propelled Tim Burton's Batman into the successful movie and eventual franchise that it was (at least for Batman and Batman Returns).Dick Tracy was filled with a long list of high caliber talent and every actor played his or her role perfectly. The plot, by design, was kept simple and with just enough twists and turns to keep it from being boring. The action moved the film along at a decent pace and there were very few, if any, moments of lag and irrelevant filler.At the end of the day Dick Tracy had all the ingredients to make it a truly spectacular film, but it was unfairly criticized for failing to appeal to a specific audience.",Dick Tracy
135,waasmusic,What a load of Dick......,1,28 July 2003,"This has to be one of the worst films of the 1990s. When my friends & I were watching this film (being the target audience it was aimed at) we just sat & watched the first half an hour with our jaws touching the floor at how bad it really was. The rest of the time, everyone else in the theatre just started talking to each other, leaving or generally crying into their popcorn that they actually paid money they had earnt working to watch this feeble excuse for a film. It must have looked like a great idea on paper, but on film it looks like no-one in the film has a clue what is going on. Crap acting, crap costumes. I can't get across how embarrasing this is to watch. Save yourself an hour & a bit of your life.........",Dick Tracy
136,undedavenger,One of my favorite movies as a kid. Plus MADONNA.. WOW!,8,29 February 2008,"Just picked this up on DVD and watched it again. I love the bright colors vs. dark imagery. Not a big Beatty fan, but this is an excellent popcorn movie. Pacino is astounding, as always, and well, this movie marked the period where Madonna was her absolute sexiest. I wish she had stuck with the ""Breathless"" look for a while longer. Charlie Korsmo's first really big role, other than ""What about bob?"". The makeup effects were cutting edge then and still hold up for the most part. Beautiful scenery and mood transport you directly into a comic strip environment. The cars, wardrobe, buildings, and even the streetlights et a great tone, not to mention the perfect lighting, although the scenes with a lot of red can get a tad annoying, as it tends to blur a little. Just wish Beatty had gotten the chance to make a sequel. All in all, a fun few hours.",Dick Tracy
137,Ciaran_Clarke99,A vibrant and colourful gem,6,19 January 2020,"Each character has their own unique identity that makes each and everyone of them stand out. Each location is so lively and wonderful. Al Pacino as Big Boy Caprice is one of my favourite of his performances, Madonna plays the seductive femme fatale Breathless Mahoney perfectly and the score is just a joy to listen to.
And overall one of the best comic book films I've ever seen.",Dick Tracy
138,BillyBlue,Loved it!,10,13 September 2002,"It's funny. It's romantic. It's exciting. What more can you want from a film? Warren Beatty in his best performance as detective Dick Tracy, Al Pacino is great as Big Boy, Charlie Korsmo & Glenn Headley are amazing and Madonna is...well, horrible. But this is still a movie i highly recommend for EVERYONE!",Dick Tracy
139,SoniaRumzi,One of the best adaptations of a comic!,10,28 December 2011,"I love this movie. Between the colors, the old cars, the treatment of the dames, it came as close to authentic as it could without being crass. Not a moment of boredom or failure. It fulfilled all the elements of a cartoon and then some.Just loved it. Warren Beatty was dreamy and Madonna sparkled. Loved it.The action was dramatic and over acted in the best way possible when it comes to cartoon action. It was over the top in many ways which made it even more lovable and fun. One of the best action movies.",Dick Tracy
140,jjasper-2,possibly one of the worst films ever made,1,1 September 2007,"As other viewers have mentioned, this film was an interesting experiment in photography. The colors are comic book bold. I think the director got carried away with his ""artistic vision"" over the look of the film instead o badly needed attention to content. Despite its stellar cast, the performances are lackluster and the story nearly incoherent. Madonna was likely cast purely as a stunt to get pre-release press. A good thing as her appearance here lent some credence to her album ""I'm Breathless (Music inspired by the film Dick Tracy)"" which was a stratospheric hit (due in large part to the inclusion of dance-hit ""Vogue"" - which is not in, nor has the slightest relation to this film). I'd guess the major portion of money from this film came from tie-ins to Madonna's ""I'm Breathless"" album.If you watch it at home, by end-titles, you'll think ""there's two hours out of my life I'd like to have back."" Save yourself the wasted time - do not bother with this.",Dick Tracy
141,yankeefan1987,A disgrace to a classic comic strip.,2,6 July 2001,i just saw Dick Tracy and I thought it was terrible. The paintings in the background of the cities looked awful. Also the mob characters looked too weird. Warren Beatty didn't do an awful job as Dick Tracy but it was definetely not one of his better performances. Madonna should just stick to singing. Glenne Headly did a good job in this movie. I gave this movie a 2/10 just because of the amazing acting by Al Pacino. It wasn't a high note in his career but he still did a good  job.,Dick Tracy
142,Leaper4077,An Underrated Classic,10,27 November 2008,"The triumph of Warren Beatty's career and one of the finest comic book movies ever made. Dick Tracy combines brilliant art direction, exquisite makeup and dazzling original songs by the great Stephen Sondheim to painstakingly recreate the look, ambiance and values of a 1940s comic strip. Viewers accustomed to the dark, gritty superhero epics of today might find the effect synthetic and campy, but anyone with a sense of nostalgia or an appreciation for America's cultural heritage will have a blast. The actors certainly seem to be inspired by the creativity and uniqueness of the material, with Beatty bringing an unexpected level of emotional depth to the title character, Pacino turning in the flashiest and funniest performance of his career as the villainous Big Boy Caprice and Glenn Headly effortlessly breaking your heart and the devoted but put-upon Tess Trueheart. And if that's not enough, you get hilarious cameos from Paul Sorvino, Dustin Hoffman, Kathy Bates, Dick Van Dyke and James Caan (what a pleasure to see him and Pacino sitting on opposite sides of a very long table fighting for control of the mob!). Heck, even the usually comatose Madonna does some decent work here. A highly underrated pleasure.",Dick Tracy
143,pelikan-79472,Good art direction can't save a dire screenplay and terrible performances by the leads.,2,2 February 2017,"When the color palette receives the most praise, it's a pretty sure bet that the script and performances stink. That's certainly the case here. Warren Beatty and Al Pacino are awful, the former aimlessly underplaying and the latter shamelessly overacting, as seems to be usual for each. It is painful to watch two actors who began their respective careers with so much promise become incapable of delivering actual characterizations instead of self indulgent, mannered displays of ego. The supporting performances are okay, but are buried under a ton of make-up and a bloated screenplay. I would rather watch Jell- o if color passes for entertainment.",Dick Tracy

Something is wrong with that picture. Personally I give it a 10. I can see a 7 at the lowest or a possible 8 if it was rated by people that see this movie for what it truly is. It is a movie based on a comic book hero. This movie won more than it's share of awards. Won 3 Oscars. Another 5 wins & 26 nominations .... right there tells me it's better than a 5.8. Some great acting from some very good actors, some great special effects and in my opinion will be if not already a classic for years to come. If you're looking for pure entertainment be sure to check out Dick Tracy. Definitely a movie you can watch more than a few times. Al Pacino is great as Big Boy Caprice.",Dick Tracy
145,hreinert,Great fun,8,4 December 1999,"This movie is so campy that it's great fun, especially for those of us who are old enough to have been great fans of the comic strip years ago.  The use of lighting, basic colors and obviously hokey backdrops all enhanced the comic book feeling of the movie. As in any good old-fashioned morality tale, there was never any question who were the good guys and the bad guys. And the bad guys lose, and the good guys win.",Dick Tracy
146,haploiskevin,Beatty is great as usual,7,24 February 2001,"Beatty is a fantastic actor and has practised skill with art direction, characterization, and theme identification.  Dick Tracy is a beautifully made film, with many fine performances (some rather small) by familiar actors.  The characters of this film bring about a strong nostalgia for a time of purer ideals... even for those of us who have never known such a time.  You just can't beat Dick Tracy for upstanding street hero.",Dick Tracy
147,hbkvixen1,Best Comic Book movie made yet!,10,3 February 2002,"Dick Tracy is easily the best comic book based movie made to date. The movie has the same feel as the comic book, staying true to the color scheme. The Batman series has climbed, fallen, climbed and fallen again. Dick Tracy has true staying power as something that both adults and children can enjoy. The good guys triumph over evil, without blood and gore to get the point across. Al Pacino does a wonderful job of his own adaptation of Big Boy Caprice and Madonna is memorable as Breathless. But the best job by far is Warren Beatty who just epitomizes Dick Tracy just as he did with Clyde Barrows. I can't wait until it comes out on DVD on April 2, 2002, my tape is wearing thin.",Dick Tracy
148,bpcalsyn,"A fun, modern classic film... but with ONE TERRIBLE FLAW!!!",8,24 August 2020,"Saw this movie in the theaters as a kid, loved it... grew up (and became a cinema/movie nut somewhere in between). Just randomly watched it and I've realized that this movie has one major flaw, so bad that I don't think I can ever watch it again.Instead of being played by Madonna, the character ""Breathless Mahoney"" should have been played by Michelle Pfeiffer! and that's the tragedy, because she didn't. Pfeiffer would have been perfect for the role! She had the looks, the voice, and the ability to play such a dynamic and conflicted character - and would/could have done it better than anyone else. And of course to have Pfeiffer/Pacino (Scarface) on screen together again, would have been a treat in itself.It truly would have been a remarkable performance... so much so that just imagining how good it could have been with Pfeiffer playing Mahoney instead of Madonna (no offense) and how much better the film could have been if she had, it's ruined forever for me (haha). Now I don't think I can ever watch it again!",Dick Tracy
149,Scorsese_Fan44,"Fun, Exciting and Underrated.",7,12 November 2007,"After seeing Dick Tracy in the 6.99$ bin at Future Shop I decided to give it a go with no previous knowledge and being a big fan of Mafia and Crime movies. I was very surprised to see a very fun, smart entertaining movie with solid performances throughout. The movie moves along well, it has of course another solid performance from Warren Beatty, but the real standouts of the film are Al Pacino and Madonna. I was happy to find out that Pacino was nominated for his performance as an over the top gangster trying to take down the city. Madonna was great as the damsel in distress, she really impressed me and added depth to her performance. If you go in with the attitude of wanting to watch a fun, smart movie with great acting and a solid script then give Dick Tracy a try. I don't think you will be disappointed. And Watch for the cameos from Paul Sorvino, James Caan, Kathy Bates and Dustin Hoffman among others.",Dick Tracy
150,pamkirkliz,Why Wait for the Sunday Funnies Section?,8,12 October 2003,"""Dick Tracy"" is one of our family's favorites -- the actors are great -- the art direction is exceptional -- the music is magic. It's not supposed to be ""To Kill A Mockingbird"" -- it's a fun experience.Stephen Sondhemim's songs are stellar: ""Back in Business"" is energetic, ""Sooner or Later"" is just right, ""What Can You Lose"" is haunting -- even tunes like ""Live Alone and Like It"" add to the storyGot to love the giddily over-the-top performances of Al Pacino, Dustin Hoffman, Glenn Headly, Charlie Korsmo, Mandy Patinkin, James Caan, Dick Van Dyke, supporting villains...  The list is far too long. And, yes -- even Madonna and Warren Beatty are awesome.  Written with a smile a minute (how many times have we looked at each other and said, ""Wait a minute -- I'm having a thought -- it's gone!""?).However, one of most telling things about in this film is that everyone involved seems to be having a good time -- and that above all adds to the enjoyment for the viewer.  So, if you haven't already, why not give ""Dick Tracy"" a chance -- accept it for what it is -- a Sunday comic strip brought to life -- and in a wonderful way!!",Dick Tracy

152,guybiz,Awesome Film,10,4 July 2005,"I loved this movie because I am a big fan of Dick Tracy, Waren Beatty and all of the actors did a terrific job of acting out their characters! The only thing that I wasn't too happy about, just like the Batman movies is that most of the big villains were killed in the first movie, 5 were killed in the first 5 minutes by other villains. But my main question, if you know the answer is: What kinds and makes of cars were used in filming this movie. Waren Beatty seems to do a lot of gangster-like films and used similar makes of cars, and was wondering what they were. They are really beautiful and can't tell what they are? Feel free to e-mail me if you have any information? Thank you",Dick Tracy
153,nhartman0214,A Fun Time!,8,3 August 2014,"The 1990 film Dick Tracy is the most modern cinematic take on the comic strip created by Chester Gould which ran from 1931 to 1977. This version stars Warren Beatty as Dick Tracy and his love interest Tess Trueheart is played by Glenne Headly. Dick Tracy continues on his mission to clean the city of the gangster that try to run things. Big Boy Caprice played by Al Pacino is trying to unite all of the different mob organization to take over the city and be done with Tracy for good. Those who don't join him such as Pat Patton (James Caan) and Lips Manless (Paul Sorvino) meet an untimely demise. The only one who can stop Big Boy is Tracy. Tracy hits the gangster hard until the character called No Face frames him for the murder of D.A. Fletcher (Dick Van Dyke). With Tracy off the streets Big Boy and his goons own the town. How will Tracy with the help of Kid (Charlie Korsmo) put an end to this madness? With the main theme being the typical good versus evil that is present in so many comic to movie story lines, this is not the melodramatic dark story of Batman. It parallels in a lot of ways to Sin City. The use of colors to make up the cities between the two films is similar as is the hard-nosed cop going after the bad guy at any costs. While this is a much more family friendly movie than Sin City, the similarities between the two in terms of graphics are definitely there.Besides the amazingly bright colors that make up the city and the costumes, the singing done by Breathless Mahoney (Madonna), when she isn't too busy trying to seduce Tracy, really captures the camera. By the end of the movie you might be wishing that they had cut a song or two out of it, but none the less, Breathless lived up to her name with her amazing revealing costumes. The costume designing throughout the movie was great as many characters seemed to match. Kid took quite a liking to Tess and was often seen wearing the same shade of red as she was. Tracy wore his trademark yellow trench coat and fedora of course, but every character in the movie was dressed to the 9's.The only part of the movie that really out-shined the wardrobe was the superb job done by the makeup department. The effect they used to change the faces of the villains was incredible. Big Boy was only identifiable as Al Pacino by his voice, and the work done to Flat-Top was great. The job of acting by Dustin Hoffman in the role of Mumbles will leave you laughing, especially the scene with the court reporter.Overall this is a fun movie to watch as a family. There are the parts that will make the parents smile, and the content is suitable for most ages, as well as the theme of good versus evil in a dazzling colored world, and you will finish the movie wishing you had one of the famous Dick Tracy two-way watches.",Dick Tracy

155,rojan-113-161964,"Dick Tracy, a must see film.",8,21 September 2014,"""Dick Tracy"", I think the only way to sum that up is ""ahead of its time"". There are so many movies that have taken cues from it, it's honestly amazing. ""300"", ""Sin City"", and ""a Scanner Darkly"" all smack of influences from the movie. So, here we have a movie based on a comic strip that utilized a lot of the visual styles of the comic. The costumes, cars and sets all look like they belong in the Sunday funnies. The comic strip itself originally started in the early 1920's and for most of its run imitated the daily real life of the world around it. With the exception of the character ""Big Boy"" and maybe a few others, most of the villains in the comic strip were individual's not affiliated with organized crime. The movie however, visually sets itself in the mid 1930's. No exact date is given, but it sets itself up as an essentially stereotypical gangster movie, complete with the mob boss and the goons with funny names. Thematically, its essentially your run of the mill good guys win at the end of the day procedural police film, you don't need to watch much of it to find out that there is going to be A) silly bad guys that are more funny than bad B) super sexy objects of sexual desire – after all, Madonna mid 1990 was smoking hot, as the very svelte, very sensuous ""Breathless Mahoney"" – Britany Spears could have taken notes. Comic relief is supplied by the gangsters themselves and the very dramatic over acting of all of the actors, something that we saw in shows like the TV series of ""Batman"" from the 60's. Along that line the use of color, most notably Tracy with his white/eggshell colored coat is denoted as the ""good guy"" while Breathless, is continually shown in various black dresses, obviously to highlight her as the main provocatrix in the story. As the story evolves Breathless has a change of heart, you see her in the last scene in the club in a white dress, before the last scene with her alter ego ""Faceless"", when it is revealed to Tracy that she is the one who not only set him up for murder, but is also the one who drives the situation in which ""Big Boy"" is killed, relieving him of his arch nemesis. Much like another movie ""The Crow"", Dick Tracy makes special use of its choice of color, especially in terms of how the mood is set and for whom you should be paying attention to in the story. Whereas ""The Crow"" is essentially very dark with only small amounts of color, most of which is during the ""happier"" scenes, the use of bright color throughout ""Dick Tracy"" suggests a light and almost comedic mood in relation to its much darker theme elements and with the main characters, Breathless and Tracy, being shown in strikingly contrasting colors, until the end of the film.With all of the emphasis on theme and its gentle poking at social issues such as organized crime, police abuse of power, and child abuse the film can seem a little drab. Its silly characters and its bright colors seem almost out place when discussing these issues and today's movie going audience would be better served by something that looked more like ""Sin City"". All that said, ""Dick Tracy"" is a classic film, if you haven't seen it you need to, if you have seen it, watch it again and think about what the film is actually about and then realize that it was truly ahead of its time, buts definitely a great film.",Dick Tracy
