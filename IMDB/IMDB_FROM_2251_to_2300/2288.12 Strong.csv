0,Leofwine_draca,Fast and furious,6,30 September 2018,"12 STRONG is another Middle Eastern war epic, following on from the likes of LONE SURVIVOR and 13 HOURS. This one sees a typically rugged Chris Hemsworth playing alongside an introspective Michael Shannon as the leaders of a small squad of specialist soldiers who head into Afghanistan to help fight the Taliban after 9/11. They join up with a local warlord to take part in some skirmishes in the mountains. This film's strength lies in the quality of the action sequences, which are briskly directed with a maximum of firepower and pyrotechnic effects. The explosions have never looked so real or hard-hitting. The story is simplicity in itself and the characters little more than walking heroes, but this is fast and furious viewing that delivers on its promises.",12 Strong
1,SnoopyStyle,old style war movie,6,18 April 2018,"Captain Mitch Nelson (Chris Hemsworth) had gotten a desk job for his family. When America is attacked on 9/11, he pushes to retract from his reassignment to lead his men into the fight against the Taliban in Afghanistan. Hal Spencer (Michael Shannon) is his veteran Chief Warrant Officer. The squad of twelve men joins one of the competing Northern Alliance leaders, Dostum.This is old style patriotic militarism and it does it well. Hemsworth plays the blonde godlike hero. There is plenty of war action. My biggest complaint is the constant need to get Mitch in the middle of the gun battles. Dostum is needlessly reckless to the point of suicidal. The fighting is geared to be cinematic rather than being realistic. They literally walk into traps more than once. There is one scene where dozen of men carry their weapons offering to surrender. For some unknown reason, the Americans stupidly walk out of their fighting positions into exposed ground. It makes the Americans look bad to do something so dumb. A better way is to have one child soldier surrendering and then set off the booby-trap. This is much more an old style action war movie rather than a deeper portrayal of modern war.",12 Strong
2,boblipton,Nor Border Nor Breed Nor Birth,6,21 February 2021,"It's one of those movies about men who get the job done, with plenty of guns, ammo and riding around Afghanistan and Uzbekistan on horses. Chris Hemsworth takes a break from playing the Mighty Thor to playing the leader of the first Special Forces unit deployed to Afghanistan following 9/11, with a lot less humor to indicate his fierce determination to accomplish his mission and get his men home. Rasmus Videbæk's camerawork is excellent, although the darkness in the print, which is he way they indicate a risky situation, may be a little too much for your taste.With Michael Pena and Michael Shannon, ad a lot of men who say their lines sowly to indicate their gravitas.",12 Strong
3,nogodnomasters,The only way home is winning.,6,9 April 2018,"This is based on a true story about 12 Green Berets who were among the first in Afghanistan. There job was to hook up with a warlord and take out the Al Qaeda/ Talban using the terms interchangeably. The group is lead by Chris Hemsworth who never had any combat experience and doesn't speak Pashtun. He is to keep the Northern Alliance together while fighting Al Qaeda tanks on horse back with 11 other guys. Chris Hemsworth was underwhelming in his performance. Rob Riggle is a comic. His role as a Colonel was a miscast. Michael Peña did a good job among a bunch of phoned in performances. They attempted to build things up but the intensity just wasn't there. It was interesting in what they did and how they did it, indeed very heroic. What was anti-climatic was that they just won a battle in a never ending war where America has gone from liberator to occupier. Guide: F-word. No sex or nudity.",12 Strong
4,kosmasp,Strong as ...,7,11 October 2020,"War movies are not always easy to make and even tougher to watch. And when they are based on a real story/persons, some may feel even more inclined to be careful. I'm not aware of the full story, so I can't really tell you if the movie is close to what actually happens. Although to be fair, it would be an account from people involved and there probably would be some exaggeration or forgetting certain things.Having said that, what we do see here, is patriotism, but also heroism. Now you may be a bit careful when it comes to those things, but if you can suspend your disbelief enough to watch this, this is suspsensful enough and carries through to the end. Good action and a few one liners complete the picture ... not great, but quite decent",12 Strong
5,ma-cortes,"Nail-biting and thrilling film with spectacular warlike feats , frantic action , emotion and breathtaking battles",7,23 August 2020,"Acceptable War film based on the book ""Horse Soldiers"" , renamed ""12 Strong"", upon the pic's release written by Doug Stanton, concerning a motley team led by captain Mitch Nelson and his squadron who carry out a suicide mission behind enemy lines . Chris Hemsworth assumes the main character as commando leader in this ordinary wartime movie competent and professionally directed .12 Strong tells the story of the first Special Forces team deployed to Afghanistan after 9/11 ; under the leadership of a new captain , Mitch Nelson (Chris Hemsworth married in the fiction and really to Elsa Pataky) and officer Hal Spencer (Michael Shannon) along with the valiant team (Michael Peña , Trevante Rhodes , Geoff Stuffs , Thad Luckinbill, Austin Stonewell, among others) must work with an Afghan warlord called Gen. Dostum (Navid Negahban) to take off the bloody Taliban army by providing the necessary information to US bombers -the B-52s making the bombing run are from Barksdale AFB, Louisiana to Afghanistan- to execute massive air attacks against enemy . All of them under-commanding from Colonel Mulholl (William Fichtner) who as Delta Force leader provides them information enough about targets to attack and subsequently they take over the country and defeat the Taliban enemy , allowing other Special Forces and the rest of the conventional military to go on their long war against the fanatic enemies . On September 11, 2001 the world watched in terror . On September 12, 2001 they volunteered to fight.The Declassified True Story of the Horse Soldiers . Inside every soldier hides a warrior.This is an entertaining and epic film concerning the true Story of the Army's Special Forces ""Green Berets"" , with Chris Hemsworth as Captain Mitch Nelson , he is a tough officer along with the ordinary team of brave US soldiers whose mission is to pull off an extremely dangerous assignment : to take down the Taliban and destruction the enemy position , as they are tasked by being transported by Chinook helicopter along the Afghan territory . As Chris/Mitch training and commanding a group of awesome and eclectic soldiers for a dangerous assault on the mountainous far desert . In the hands of hardboiled director Nicolai Fuglsig and a tough-as-leather cast , that's all the plot that's needed to make one rip-roaring wartime flick . The movie is based on Doug Stanton's non-fiction book ""Horse Soldiers"", with interesting screenplay by Ted Tally who long time ago wrote the successful ¨The silence of the lambs¨, which tells the story of CIA paramilitary officers and U.S. Special Forces personnel in addition to USAF Combat Controllers, sent to Afghanistan immediately after the 9/11 attacks . This moving film packs frenetic thrills , perilous adventures , choreographed crossfire , sneering evil enemies , and buck-loads of explosive action and violence . However , it doesn't matter what they are after , because the point of the film is not to educate spectators about actual facts that their textbooks didn't cover , but to amuse people with an outrageous story , kinetic stunts , relentless feats , blowing up and goofy physical action . The noisy action is uniformly well-made, especially deserving of mention the rip-roaring final scenes on the defile , including some spectacular shootouts , bombing and explosion . Apart from the values of team spirit , cudgeled by Chris/Mitch and his two-fisted squadron , the film is full of feats , suspense, intrigue and thrills . Highlights of the movie are the impressive and overwhelming horse raids carried out by the valiant ¨Horse Soldiers"" .This film belongs to the mini-genre dealing with the revenge carried out by the US that within weeks responded to the 9-11 attack, such as : ¨Seal Team Six: The Raid on Osama Bin Laden¨ by John Stockwell and ¨Zero Dark Thirty¨ by Kathryn Bigelow . It displays a colorful and attractive cinematography by Rasmus Videbæk . Shot on location in Afghanistan , Uzbekistan , Mines Near Orogrande , Socorro,New Mexico Alamogordo, New Mexico, Santa Clarita, California, and much of the filming took place near White Sands Missile Range . As well as rousing and moving musical score by Lorne Balfe . Lavishly financed by the great producer Jerry Bruckheimer , an expert on Blockbusters , in fact its is Jerry Bruckheimer's second film to be released by Warner Bros Pictures and being well made by Nicolai Fuglsig in his only film . Rating : 7/10 . Better than average. The motion picture will appeal to Chris Hemsworth fans and Warfare buffs .",12 Strong
6,tavm,12 Strong was quite a compelling military drama concerning events happening soon after 9/11,8,15 February 2018,"Just watched this with my movie theatre-working friend. Based on a true story of what happened in Afghanistan as American military men were deployed there, I admit to not always knowing what was going on but when the bad guys got it, well, it was quite thrilling to watch, that's for sure! I actually wouldn't mind watching this again, if only so I could understand more about the logistics of getting in and out of the battles so quickly. So on that note, 12 Strong is very much worth a look.",12 Strong

8,CinemaSerf,Just don't look at this too closely....,6,27 June 2020,"Though this is certainly a well crafted piece of cinema, the narrative is riddled with inconsistencies that frankly put this on the borderline between fact and propaganda, That's not to decry the considerable bravery and achievements of the battalion sent to assist local tribes in their battle with an incredibly well armed Taliban; and were this just to be treated as an action adventure film on that basis then it's long, but quite watchable. It isn't though - and as such comes across as a confused, rather gung-ho, interpretation of facts that don't really stand up to too much scrutiny if you have even the faintest soupçon of knowledge as to the political situation prevailing in war-torn Afghanistan at the start of the 21st Century. Neither Chris Hemsworth nor Michael Peña bring much to the party from a performance perspective and though the photography (New Mexico) does give us some sort of indiction as to how remote and bleak the territory is; this is just a rather poor war film about a more recent war, with some good effects.",12 Strong
9,grantss,Weak,4,14 December 2018,"After the tragic events of 9/11, the US determines that the Taliban in Afghanistan is the source of many of the attacks on US citizens and assets. Their first step in confronting the Taliban is to send in Special Forces teams to link up with the Northern Alliance, the enemies of the Taliban, help them in their fight against Taliban, including through coordinating air support, and reduce the Taliban's territory. The first team ""in country"" is Operational Detachment Alpha 595, lead by Captain Mitch Nelson. The 12 of them face overwhelming odds. This is their story.War movies generally fall into one of two buckets. First is the engaging, plot-and-character based, realistic, gritty type, e.g. Saving Private Ryan, Platoon. Second is the superficial, gung ho, all-action and nothing else type, e.g. this movie.Quite weak, formulaic and lacking in substance. From the outset the clichés start to flow and they never let up. The attempts at engagement are so badly done - the trite family life scenes, the clumsy attempts to create some sense of camaraderie - that you already know the director isn't much good and this isn't going to go well. Anything that's not a battle scene is generally eye-rollingly bad.The battle scenes, however, are quite well done and prevent this movie from being a total waste of time. A bit over-the-top at times but still interesting viewing.Overall, give it a miss. This is not to detract from the bravery and achievements of the actual ODA 595, whose feats are worth capturing in a film. Just not this film. They deserve better.",12 Strong
10,oscaralbert,"Warner Bros. works valiantly to help Americans ""connect the dots"" . . .",9,30 January 2018,". . . about our 21st Century History with 12 STRONG. Early on during 12 STRONG we are treated to a view of Red Commie KGB Chief Vlad ""The Mad Russian"" Putin muttering about unleashing his rabid mutt Osama Bin Laden against America. Later, the Weasel's defense secretary Rumsfeld is shown swallowing Putin's bait about ""Weapons of Mass Destruction"" to lure the U.S. into another disastrous quagmire. Between Afghanistan and Iraq (the proverbial gap separating a rock from a hard place), America has seen 10,000 of our own slain, 100,000 wounded, with a price tag of Three TRILLION bucks and counting. This is a far greater toll than that racked up by Russia in Afghanistan, and the Soviet Bear's modest losses were enough to rip apart the U.S.S.R. in into 15 pieces. ""Afghanistan is where Empires go to die,"" the characters of 12 STRONG say in various ways at least seven times during this Docudrama. America has lost the War against Afghanistan just as surely as the campaign against Ho Chi Minh's Vietnam, with the past few days seeing two attacks in that failed nation's capital, the first of which killed two dozen at what passes for a ""luxury"" hotel and the second tearing more that 100 locals limb from limb. Tet Uprising, anyone? Any day now ""Osama Bin Ladenville"" will join ""Ho Chi Minh City"" as a world capital. If failed president Jimmy Carter had just done something useful (like nuking Iran, Russia, and Afghanistan) instead of boycotting the Olympics, we would not be in our sorry state Today, 12 STRONG suggests.

12,neil-476,Action with questions,7,1 May 2018,"A group of 12 US soldiers is sent to Afghanistan to help an Afghan warlord strike a decisive blow against the Taliban.This true but previously classified tale of US seeking to weaken Al Quaeda's power base after 9/11 has Chris Hemsworth and Michael Shannon as the senior members of the squad (Michael Pena is the only other member I have ever seen) and the excellent Navid Negahban as General Dostum.The two main elements of the movie are the uneasy development of the relationship between Hemsworth's character and the general (we are told that Dostum is now Vice-President and that the friendship between the two men has continued) and action.I'm in two minds about the action. It is well staged and exciting, but I sometimes felt I was watching a western from the 40s or 50s when the 7th Cavalry storms an Indian village and wipes out every one of those pesky redskin varmints. The ease with which hundreds of anonymous Taliban black-clad spear-carriers are mown down by the goodies pays little heed to the fact that, irrespective of how abhorrent you find their beliefs and activities, these were human beings, many of them possibly pressganged into service against their will.I was entertained, but felt uneasy about it.",12 Strong
13,ferguson-6,giddyup,6,19 January 2018,"Greetings again from the darkness. During the movie, Afghanistan is referred to as ""the graveyard of many empires"". Traditionally, January is the graveyard of most new movie releases, so it's a pleasant surprise when we see an entertaining, well-made and historically interesting film, and it's still mid-January! Doug Stanton's book ""Horse Soldiers"" is the source material for director Nicolai Fuglsig's first feature film, and it's anything but a disappointment.The film opens on September 11, 2001 and subjects us, yet again, to those horrific images seared into the minds of anyone alive on that day. What most of us didn't know, was that about a month later, a team of U.S. Army Special Forces (the Green Berets) were being dropped into the rough and mostly unfriendly terrain of Afghanistan. This ridiculously courageous team of 12 men had one mission: secure Mazar-i-Sharif to prevent a takeover by the Taliban. An early scene tells us this won't be the usual blind patriotism we often see on screen. One of the soldiers, Hal Spencer (Michael Shannon), is told (with a bit of anger) by his wife, ""I'll love you when you get back."" This contrasts to the usual loyal and stiff-upper-lip military wife we see in most war movies. Another wife scrubs the oven rather than snuggle with her man, while yet another coerces a taboo pledge to come home to her.Chris Hemsworth (THOR) plays Captain Mitch Nelson, the intelligent but not-yet-battle-tested leader of a special ops team. The plan is for Nelson and his team to connect with General Dostum, an Afghan War Lord in charge of the Northern Alliance, and fight together to gain control of Mazar. After arriving at a local outpost nicknamed ""The Alamo"" (34 miles from town), the team gets their first surprise ... they must split up and cover the ground on horseback. Filmed in New Mexico, the journey is miserable and filled with danger - an ambush could occur at any moment, or perhaps they are being set-up by those they have been ordered to trust.Horseback riding, caves, the weather, and the elements of the terrain are all challenges, but none of it compares to facing the Taliban forces which number in the thousands, and feature tanks, rocket launchers and an endless supply of weaponry. Director Fuglsig utilizes a ""Days in Country"" counter so that we can get some semblance of time and ongoing misery being fought through by the Americans. But no day is normal when the soldiers are on horseback while being attacked by tanks. The odds seem insurmountable.One of the more fascinating aspects of the story and welcome approaches of the film is back-and-forth between Captain Nelson and General Dostum. Initially, Dostum shows little respect by telling the young officer that he lacks ""the eyes of a killer"" and isn't yet a warrior, and he spends a great deal of time lecturing and philosophizing on Nelson's behalf. Of course, the lessons may be frustrating in the moment, but aren't lost on Nelson as there is a huge payoff at the peak of the key battle.The battle scenes come in all sizes - small skirmishes and massive, large scale assaults. Each is intense and dramatic and well-staged, though there are some moments where we shake our head in disbelief. At least we do until we remember that this is a true story, and despite that, it is truly unbelievable.
The supporting cast includes Michael Pena and his snappy punchlines, Trevante Rhodes (MOONLIGHT), William Fichtner with a shaved head, Elsa Pataky - Hemsworth's real life wife as his screen wife, Taylor Sheridan, Geoff Stults and Jack Kesy. Rob Riggle plays Colonel Max Bowers, who was Riggle's commanding officer when he served in the Marines. The previously mentioned Michael Shannon is a bit underutilized, but the film's best moments are those with Hemsworth and Navid Negahban (as General Dostum). You likely recognize Negahban as Abu Nazir from ""Homeland"". It's their exchanges that show how the line between allies and enemies is not always crystal clear - even if they are fighting for the same thing.Writers Peter Craig (THE TOWN) and Ted Tally (Oscar winner for THE SILENCE OF THE LAMBS) do a nice job of character development, and the camaraderie of the 12 men of ODA 595 seems authentic - despite some schmaltzy moments over their 23 days of Task Force Dagger. Early on, we are informed that the most important thing to take to war is ""a reason why"", and then towards the end, Dostum explains that the United States is in a no-win situation: we are cowards if we go, and enemies if we stay. It's chilling commentary on a war that has dragged on much too long ... despite the heroic efforts of the 12 horse soldiers.",12 Strong
14,phd_travel,Finally a war movie where you can root for the heroes,8,18 January 2018,"Finally a heroic war movie with lots of action that is an interesting true story and the viewer can root for the hero because they are on the right side of history. There have been a lot of war movies recently that are on the depressing side where everyone but one is killed, or it's an anti war movie where the futility of war and being on the wrong side for the wrong reasons, or they are up against overwhelming odds and put up a valiant fight but fail. 12 Strong isn't one of those being set in 2001 before things got all muddied in Iraq.. The story is simple and clearly explained and the mission is easy to understand. They are the first force to go after Al Qaeda and the Taliban in Afghanistan in 2001. As things progress the battles become more and more intense from planes dropping bombs then scary gun battles to tanks vs horses to a grand finale that is a true Western style horses and guns blazing all out battle. The cast is good - Chris Hemsworth doesn't overwhelm the screen so he is convincing enough. Michael Shannon plays a soldier quite well too. There are a few slightly cheap things about the beginning and ending, it's not as slickly done as a Peter Berg movie. Nevertheless it's a good solid almost old fashioned in concept war movie that leaves you with a good feeling.",12 Strong
15,Hellmant,For me the film is just way too boring.,5,19 January 2018,"'12 STRONG': Two and a Half Stars (Out of Five)A war film about CIA Paramilitary and U.S. Special Forces who were sent to Afghanistan, immediately after the September 11th attacks, to combat Taliban soldiers there. It's based on the non-fiction book 'Horse Soldiers' by Doug Stanton, and it was scripted by Ted Tally and Peter Craig. Sophomore feature filmmaker Nicolai Fuglsig directed the movie, which stars Chris Hemsworth, Michael Shannon, Navid Negahban, Michael Pena, Trevante Rhodes, Geoff Stults, Thad Luckinbill, William Fichtner and Rob Riggle. It's received mixed reviews from critics, and it's expected to be a modest hit at the Box Office as well. I found it to be pretty dull and uninvolving. The story begins with the September 11th terrorist attacks being witnessed on TV by Captain Mitch Nelson (Hemsworth), and his family. Mitch is eager to retaliate against those responsible, and he begs his superior officers for his Captain position back, in order to do so. Mitch, along with Chief Warrant Officer Cal Spencer (Shannon), Sergeant First Class Sam Diller (Pena), and other U.S. soldiers, are then sent to Afghanistan to attack the Taliban forces there. Once there, they partner with the leader of the alliance, General Abdul Rashid Dostum (Negahban), and quickly start to plot their revenge. The movie looks like a fun war action flick, and I like the premise to it, but for me the film is just way too boring. I couldn't even get into the action scenes (which I'll admit happens a lot for me with recent action flicks), but the whole story, and character development, is pretty weak and uninvolving. The performances are pretty dull and uninspired too, and it's definitely a talented cast. With the exception of Navid Negahban (he's a scene stealer in it), most of the actors seem to be just there for their paychecks. I could not wait for the movie to be over, for most of it's 2 hour and 10 minute running time, but I'll admit that I'm sure some action junkies, and war film fans, will probably enjoy it. Technically speaking, the movie isn't half bad.",12 Strong

17,bowmanblue,Thor vs the Taliban,7,4 December 2018,"When I watch a film like '12 Strong,' i.e. one that's 'based on true events,' I always feel like I should research the true story before deciding on how good the film is. It tells the tale of the first group of American soldiers sent into Afghanistan after the 9/11 attacks who paved the way for the Allied invasion and subsequent regime change for the Middle Eastern country. Naturally, it's all told from America's perspective, but with any Hollywood war movie, what did you expect? Anyway, it's naturally very patriotic and, although I can't confirm or deny on how close to the actual story this depiction is, it's still pretty good fun. And, dare I say that's mainly to do with its leading man, Chris 'Thor' Hemsworth.Hemsworth plays 'Captain Mitch Nelson' - the squad leader of the twelve special forces operatives sent in to meet up with various local tribes, all of which only too willing to help overthrow the Taliban. There are a couple of familiar faces thrown in there as well - the ones I recognised were Michael Shannon and William Fichtner, but, in my opinion, it's Hemsworth's show all the way. It's hardly controversial to say that he can carry a franchise with ease and here is an example of how he can generally take what is probably a bit of a mediocre and predictable film into something very watchable. He's just so damn easy to watch and somehow doesn't let his (annoyingly, in my bitter opinion!) good looks get in the way of him portraying a kind of 'everyman' soldier who you could just imagine leading a platoon of troops into battle.As you can probably imagine, the film centres around Hemsworth and his men. There is some attempt to show what's going on in the country at the time, but I did get the feeling that this was there for the added effect of showing how bad it was and therefore doubling down on justifying America's invasion of the region. They try to show the 'villain' of the film (i.e. the leader of the Taliban in the area they're attacking) and what he's up to, but the fact that the story dictates the fact that he's obviously never going to interact with our heroes, he's about as effectives as a villain as a bad guy in the Marvel Cinema Universe (excluding Loki, of course!).Besides Hemsworth, I thought the other stand-out performance came from Navid Negahban as local warlord/American ally, 'General Dostum.' He actually gets enough screen time to show us that not all residents of the country are our enemies and its good to see the bond develop between him and Hemsworth's characters. Naturally, there are also the obvious battles that you're going to get in any war film. Most of them seem pretty well done and realistic, but I think there were a few CGI explosions thrown in there as well. Like I say, I'm not sure how historically accurate this film is, but there is some text at the end (which I always go by!) that tells us a few facts and it does seem that the film-makers have done their best to tell the actual story, rather than just throwing out some US propaganda. So, if you're interested in the early days of the 'War on Terror,' like war movies, or are just a fan of Chris Hemsworth, this is actually a film that's better than I expected it to be.",12 Strong
18,ThomasDrufke,"Incredible Story, Forgettable Film",6,20 January 2018,"It's always amazing to me when I see another non-fiction war story that I was previously unaware of. It makes me wonder how many incredible stories we never hear about because there wasn't a book or a screenplay. 12 Strong, about the 12 Soldiers first to enter Afghanistan after 9/11, is yet another impressive true tale even if it doesn't quite reach the heights of it's real life counterparts.
The most gratifying aspect to 12 Strong is the interesting bond and relationship between Chris Hemsworth's Captain Nelson and Navid Negahban's General Dostum. The two have such different viewpoints on the conflict in Afghanistan and without much context a few weeks after 9/11, the moral dilemmas the two face are clearly the staple of the film. Even with a mediocre script and direction, there's enough back and forth between the two to keep my attention.
In terms of the actual war aspect to 12 Strong, it's a less than subpar affair. In a day when battles may certainly be more difficult to differentiate between sides, it seems 12 Strong accidentally played into that. While the dialogue indicates clearly to me who is ""in the right"", the shootouts in the desert and mountains are sporadically shot and chaotically structured. It really makes it difficult to tell what is happening where and who is getting shot or bombed. Perhaps that's exactly what the director intended because it could be closer to how the war actually is, but it doesn't play as well on film.
Overall, small character moments are what makes 12 Strong worth it, but it ultimately is a forgettable war film with a real life story that is better than what was put to screen.

20,The-Sarkologist,A Good Old Fashioned War Movie,8,23 January 2018,"I guess now that it has been something like fifteen years after the event I'm not surprised that we are now seeing movies appearing about some of the battles that were fought during the early days of the war on terror (probably because they have been declasified). Well, there have been a few movies previously, but most of them have involved Iraq, and weren't your traditional war movies. However, this one is, and one of the things that struck me was that it sort of reminded me of the raft of World War II movies that had been filling our screens for the last fifty odd years (as well as the occasional World War I movie).
 The story goes that shortly after September 11th, the army was mobilised and some special forces operatives were sent into Afghanistan. The idea was to link up with the Northern Alliance, a loose collection of tribes that were joined together to fight a common enemy - the Taliban. However, the catch was that when they were dropped into Afghanistan the only form of transport that was available to them were horses. Well, not quite, it was just that the rebel leader that they were working with preferred horses to vehicles, and in a way I'm not at all surprised - while the traditional cavalry unit has changed over the years to now refer to mechanised infantry (and the last cavalry unit to use horses was in the 1940s), the good old horse still works quite well in that they are more agile, and can get to places that vehicles, and even tanks, can't.
 One of the things that permeates through this film is how Afghanistan is the graveyard of empires, and many nations over the centuries have attempted, without success, to conquer the region. While they mention Alexander the Great as being one of the many who tried, and failed, to conquer Afghanistan, that isn't quite correct - he was successful, it was just that his empire didn't survive his death. Afghanis who I have spoken to (I used to work with one) actually said that he is treated as a legend, and a hero, among some of the tribes.
 I guess that is the problem, and fifteen years since the events in the movie, Afghanistan still hasn't changed, and the Americans have been slowly winding down operations there. However, it could have been successful, if they had not used September 11 as a justification for an unprovoked attacked against Iraq.
 It is interesting to see how they used airstrikes in the campaign, but then again it was suggested that while the Americans may have ruled the skies, it was the warlords who ruled the land. Yet, the attacks against America did tilt the scales of the conflict for a while since the rebels now had air support which gave them an edge over their enemies. However, as history has told us, the Taliban eventually changed tactics, and while the Americans didn't take long to reach Kabul, what eventually happened was that they disappeared into the population and soon they had an insurgent war on their hands.",12 Strong

The actors were very good and credible, the action scenes were jaw-dropping, and the music was also highly effective. The photography and cinematography is great, with some stunning aerial shots.

23,cruise01,12 brave soldiers riding into battle delivers on the action but lacks in character depth.,7,20 January 2018,"12 Strong shows the highlight of the 12 American soldiers battling against the Taliban soldiers after the 9/11 attacks. 12 Strong could have been a really good war film. It may have its problems with a lack of characterization in the script and a repetitive concept with the action. But the cast ensemble and the action sequences are well worth the admission. The plot follows after the 9/11 attacks. CIA paramilitary soldiers Cpt. Mitch (Chris Hemsworth) was in a hurry to go back into service after seeing the terror attacks in the news. Mitch enlist he brings his team together Sam (Michael Pena) and Spencer (Michael Shannon). Their mission in Afghanistan is to join forces with the alliance Abdul Dostum (Navid Negahban) and his army to help eliminate the Taliban forces. What I liked about 12 Strong is it does deliver on the action and explosions. May not be the best war film like Saving Private Ryan, Dunkirk, 13 Hours, ect. Seeing the brave men of Mitch and his paramilitary team form a bond with the alliance. After the 9/11 attack. His team motives of going back into service was to go kill some terrorists, no questions ask. They had trouble seeing eye to eye with the alliance. But there bond, that they will stand by the americans side to fight for there country against the Taliban. Like a saying of my enemy of my enemy is my friend or something like that. The film has a few small action sequences were Mitch calls an airstrike to eliminate the Taliban camp site with a little bit of a shoot out. Then, the climax does deliver it all with lots of explosions, intense shoot outs, and an army on horse back riding out into battle. Chris Hemsworth did great. Michael Shannon was also good. Michael Pena did well. And even Navid Negahban was also good. What I did not like about the film. I feel like the script was lacking in character depth and the plot was repetitive with the teams mission in Afghanistan. Sure, we learn a little bit about the three main characters. Chris Hemsworth has a family. His wife knows what she is in for. He is a true American patriot, when an attack on American soil happens. He will go overseas to help fight back in battle. Michael Shannon is also a family with a wife that is tired of seeing him go. And Michael Pena's character who has a wife that is also sad and tired of seeing her husband leave. When these characters are in battle there is no emotions to feel for these characters. The script literally lacks in depth that it is difficult to care for these brave soldiers when we really should feel for them. Plus when they are in battle it does feel like the life/death stakes is down to the minimum when everything is taken care of easily. It is always an easy solution of airstrikes. When these guys are hands down fighting, they are easily taken care of from fighting back or avoiding explosions and gun fire. I feel like these characters lives are not really threatened at all. Sure, the direction also lacked in building the suspense and putting you on the edge of your seat to caring for these characters. Also, the plot was repetitive with the team discovering the Taliban and calling an airstrike. Then it's done. It happens a couple of more times. And every break in between these character chat about their views of this war. And it is also were it missed the opportunity to have development for the characters. And than the final battle when 12 american soldiers are battling on horseback and getting last minute help from the alliance. Sure, these soldiers ride into battle like if it was nothing and they were invincible in avoiding gun fire and explosions. Overall, 12 Strong is a pretty fair war film. It has some great action battle sequences that will keep you entertained. Chris Hemsworth and the cast were a great choice. The film does lack in character development in the script and the direction was repetitive with the plot. I rate the film 3.5 out of 5 stars. I recommend in seeing the film in theatres for the action. May not be the best war film but still worth seeing.",12 Strong
24,eddie_baggins,Thor goes to to War in this solid action film,6,9 March 2018,"Based on a little known true story and no doubt exaggerated for the Hollywood machine, 12 Strong is an effective war film and a solid debut feature from director Nicolai Fuglsig who delivers an experience that is engaging without becoming anything overly memorable as Thor himself heads into the battlegrounds of Afghanistan to take it to Al-Qaida in the wake of the September 11 attacks in 2001.Focussed around Chris Hemsworth's Captain Mitch Nelson and his 11 man squad that includes Michael Shannon's Hal Spencer and Michael Pena's Sam Diller heading into the war torn Afghani landscape mere days after the attacks on American soil and tasked with completing a highly important mission of support to a local militant whose looking to wipe out the terrorist threat in the country, 12 Strong gives Fuglsig and his cast ample chances to get involved in some explosive and intense battles as their horse filled entourage take it to the ""big bads"" and try clear a path towards liberation.Those seeking a fix of war infused thrills and spills will be left satisfied by the experience 12 Strong has to offer them as Fuglsig director handles the carnage and intense battles well as the bullets, RPG's and bombs fly across our screens and for a film with a somewhat limited budget, Fuglsig makes the most of the tools at his disposal to give the film a sense of danger and fierceness, even if there are a few too many scenes of our heroes flying headfirst into battle as countless enemies spray bullets everywhere but at them.Where 12 Strong isn't so strong is in its ability to connect us with this particular group of men and while Hemsworth and militant leader General Dostrum (played well by Navid Negahban) get decent set-ups and screen time, Fuglsig can't quite invest us more emotionally into the bond and backgrounds of the tight-knit Green Berets squad.The best war films manage to mix both the shock and awe of battle with the human ties and that's what differentiates 12 Strong from the leaders of the pack, despite its ability to capture the time and place of this story in a constantly capable way.Final Say - 12 Strong offers up a solid if unremarkable war-set experience that features some above average battles and big screen spectacle but some unfortunately lacking human connections.3 supply drops out of 5",12 Strong
25,leonblackwood,Watchable but not that original! 6/10,6,13 August 2018,"Review:
This is one of those typical, heroic American war movies, were the Americans fight for pride and glory, for the good of there country. I liked the character building throughout the film, which gave the movie a meaning, and I liked the fact that you saw some of the soldiers at home with there families before they went into battle. The fact that it is based on a true story, also made the film enjoyable but it isn't anything that we haven't seen before. The movie is based around 9/11 when the terrorists attacked the World Trade Centre in 2001. While the attacks are happening in New York, Mitch Nelson (Chris Hemsworth) is moving into a new home with his family but he receives an assignment to staff duty under Lt. Col. Bowers (Rob Biggle). Mitch wants to gather his old unit to fight against the Taliban in Afghanistan but Bowers turns him down, even though his unit is fired up for the task. Veteran Soldier, Hal Spencer (Michael Shannon) manages to convince Bowers for Mitch to command the 595 unit to go into battle, so he is briefed about the mission from 5th Special Forces Group Commander, Col. Mulholland (William Fichtner). After leaving their families, the unit head towards Uzbekistan to fight against the Taliban, alongside a Northern Alliance leader Abdul Rashid Dostum (Navid Negahban). It takes some time for Abdul to trust Mitch and his team but once they work out there differences, they get on with the mission to capture Mazar-i Sharif, a critical city in Northern Afghanistan, from the Taliban. They also want to take down the Taliban leader Mullah Razzan (Numan Acar), who rules local communities brutally under strict Sharia law and has murdered several of his own people, including Dostum's family. Before they leave for battle, Dostum tells Mitch that he only has 6 horses spare, which means that he has to leave 6 of his unit behind, under Spencer's command. Using American AirPower, and Dostum's knowledge of the Taliban methods, they manage to destroy many of the Taliban's compounds, on the way Mazar-i Sharif. Spencer and his team join the unit but he is badly damaged by a suicide bomber and is forced to make his way back to safety. With the use of heavy attacks from the Air Force, and the Northern Alliance, they manage to destroy the Taliban and Al-Qaeda, and Dostum comes face to face with his enemy, Mullah Razzan, who he doesn't hesitate to kill on the spot. It's extremely intense throughout, and the performances from the whole cast made the film seem real but the outcome wasn't surprising. When you see the real soldiers towards the end, I did feel quite emotional, especially after watching their amazing journey on horses and the fact that they were only the second unit to fight against the Taliban after the attacks, which means that they were going into the unknown. They were also fighting against the weather because it would have been impossible for them to fight against the enemy during winter, so time wasn't on their side. Anyway, I found the movie entertaining, mainly because of the performances but I have seen this type of movie many times before. It's still worth a watch, if you want to see Chris Hemsworth out of his Thor suit but don't expect an original masterpiece. Watchable!Round-Up:
This movie was directed by Nicolai Fuglsig. Who also brought you Exfil in 2017. As I haven't watched any projects before, I can't really compare his work but from a stand-alone point, he did a good job in terms of authenticity and reality. Being from Denmark, he took on a big task to take on an American, true war story but with Chris Hemsworth being very much in the public eye at the moment, he must have known that this movie was going to get a big audience. For his second film, it didn't do to bad at the box office, and I'm surprised that he was able to make a war movie with such a low budget. Anyway, it didn't do Michael Shannon, or Chris Hemworth's career any harm, mainly because he stayed true to the original story, and he made the American's look like true heroes, once again.Budget: $35million

Celebrating the troops that fight for our freedom, 12 strong is about a 1st strike that happen after 9/11. In which 12 men went up against al-Qaida in the mountains of Afghanistan, riding on houses.
It was not the best movie I ever seen about the war and about the troops. It has suspenseful action sequences and a decent cast lead by Chris Hemsworth, but in the cast I did feel that they were underutilized.

And within that standard 12 Strong isn't as visceral as Lone Survivor, but a lot better American Sniper that tries to celebrate someone who was a vile racist.12 Strong does have a solid premise, being about the first American Special Forces soldiers to fight in Afghanistan and how they fought with the Northern Alliance. It could easily have self as a modern version of Lawrence of Arabia due to the focus on the relationship between an American soldier and an Afghan warlord who have to work together.Sadly 12 Strong isn't as epic or memorable as Lawrence of Arabia and was really a standard Hollywood war film that had a decent final battle.

This is based on a true story. You probably have never heard about it because it has been classified for years. On 9-11-01, the World Trade Centers came crashing down in a terrorist attack and the next day, plans began on a top secret mission to be launched about a month later-in October-against the Taliban & Al Qaeda in Afghanistan, who were the perpetrators. Chris led the 12 man team of Special Forces soldiers on the first retaliation. Their bosses tell them it is a suicide mission and they don't think they can accomplish the job in less than 6-8 weeks. Even with Michael S & Michael P on the team, the 12 can not just take on the whole Taliban by themselves-no matter how good of soldiers they are-so they meet up with Navid, a local Warlord that hates the Taliban, and plans on leading them into battle. Their best means of transportation is by horses and some of the 12 have never even ridden a horse before-they get quick, on the job training. So, with all these issues in their path, it is pretty amazing that any of the 12 make it out alive-I won't spoil it for you here but you do find out how many by the end. It is an inspiring story. FYI: Chris' wife in the film is played by his real life wife, Elsa Pataky.

35,3xHCCH,That Final Charge on Horseback Saved It All,6,18 January 2018,"About a month after the NYC attacks of 9/11/2001, a 12-member US Army Green Berets code-named Operational Detachment Alpha 595 (ODA 595) were chosen to be sent on a covert mission to Afghanistan. As part of Task Force Dagger, they joined forces with General Abdul Rashid Dostum (Navid Negahban) of the Northern Alliance to reclaim key Taliban-held cities there.The members of ODA 595 all had to ride horses because of the inhospitable terrain and distance they needed to cover. This was no problem for their charismatic leader Capt. Mitch Nelson (Chris Hemsworth), who grew up on a ranch, but this was his first time in actual combat. The other members, like Cal Spencer (Michael Shannon), Sam Diller (Michael Pena), Ben Milo (Trevante Rhodes), Vern Michaels (Thad Luckinbill), etc, had to master their horse-riding skills overnight on top of their combat skills in order to keep up with their dangerously harrowing mission.When they get to Afghanistan, it took some time for the war action to get going, as our heroes still needed to acquaint themselves with their unfamiliar allies. While the intense battle scenes took us in the middle of the gunfire and explosions, there was point when the action actually became repetitive as we would see the same strategy of attack (get coordinates of the camp, launch airstrike to decimate the enemy, engage the remained on the ground) for all the Taliban encampments, with just a little dramatic variation here and there for the sake of distinction.The centerpiece battle scene however was only upon us by the final thirty minutes or so of the film. This was the grand charge of Nelson's ragtag troop ON HORSEBACK to attack the superior numbers and firepower of the Taliban troops. That was an elaborate but very well-executed battle sequence for which this film would be remembered for. It was certainly unique, exciting and exhilarating to watch, worth the whole price of admission in itself. This was a good war film even if the 12 Americans all seemed to lead charmed lives despite the overwhelming odds stacked against them. On the other hand, the Taliban were all portrayed as cruel religious fanatics, as there were scenes commenting on their inhumane beliefs and practices particular about women. A strong all-American patriotic sentiment swelled at the end, fully expected in a true to life story of modern heroism as this. 6/10.",12 Strong

Good actors appear here like Michael Shannon & Michael Pena but they're not given much to do but shoot their weapons & look like warriors doing it. A much better film I felt was Lone Survivor (or 4 Strong) which told the same kind of story w/the appropriate level of gungho-ness & loss.

Its the same basic premise, with much the same context and underlying attitude. That is an exaggerated belief in the ""righteousness"" of the cause, married up to conceited obnoxious key characters who have a sense of ownership and entitlement, that puts them at odds with pretty much everyone they meet. 12 Strong is no exception. The main characters are loud, rude and generally really, really unlikable. Its hard to empathise with them or feel any genuine interest in them, especially given the historical context used yet again to justify their presence in Afghanistan. 9/11 was a led by Saudi nationals not Afghans but because the US is inextricably tied to Saudi through the petro dollar the poor Afghans drew the short straw. Of course this is never mentioned.Instead our ""hero's"" go about their heroic business in formulaic style.The action scenes are predictable but well done but really there's little more on offer here. Of course, given there never seems to be any departure from the general script, that's to be expected. Take a look but don't expect anything you have not seen before. 5/10 from me.",12 Strong
38,peterp-450-298716,Fighting against tanks with horses. That's kind of unique.,6,22 July 2018,"This is Afghanistan.
Graveyard of many empires.
Today you are our friend,tomorrow you are our enemy.
It won't be any different for you.
Soon America will become just another tribe here.
You will be cowards if you leave.
And you will be our enemies if you stay.I only asked myself one question, after seeing ""12 Strong"". Why didn't the American authorities send 1200 of those well-trained, experienced soldiers instead of this limited group of 12? Then in one fell swoop, they could have wiped out the entire Taliban and the scum that belongs to it. Now after more than 15 years, the American troops are still there and the living conditions and the political situation hasn't improved much. I can believe that these 12 elite soldiers have made a breakthrough in the fight against the Taliban there. That the entire film is based on true facts, I also want to believe. But I think that the event between dropping these soldiers and their homecoming should be taken with a fat grain of salt. It felt like a superhero movie at certain moments and it's the textbook example of displaying American patriotism. The latter a bit too much for my taste.Any idea how many Taliban fighters these 12 super-elite soldiers had a clear shot at? And how many were eventually sent to the afterlife, where they are awaited for by a harem of virgins, with a well-aimed shot? I lost count after a while. I'm sure that the automatic rifles of the American soldiers were equipped with an auto-aim function because the number of headshots was shockingly high. I suppose the Taliban fighters were equipped with obsolete Soviet arms or weapons from other parts of the world because their shooting skills left much to be desired. Or perhaps they had desert sand in the eyes. Or the American soldiers chose a perfect time to attack. Maybe these Muslim warriors were attacked the moment they rolled out their Persian carpet and knelt down towards Mecca for their prayers. I don't have another explanation. Either that or they are just extremely bad at shooting.I did admire these elite soldiers because they had to move on horseback through this country. Nothing special, you might say. But not when you find out only one person has experience in this discipline. It's surprising no one fell off an Afghan ridge. They also had an additional obstacle. Not only did the local warlords such as Dostum (David Negahban) thoroughly hate the Taliban regime. There was also the mutual rivalry between the various Afghan warlords. Afghans apparently all have a short fuse (stressful for suicide terrorists). However, I don't understand how they knew at a given moment who they should shoot at, because those Muslim fighters all look identical. ""12 Strong"" is a war film like so many others. Apart from the fact that they go to battle on horses against a force majeure with a hypermodern weapon arsenal. This gives us impressive but at the same time dubious images. It looked like ""The magnificent seven"" mixed with ""Hacksaw Ridge"".The honor of being the captain of these elite troops was given to Chris Hemsworth, who played it with bravado and conviction. Mitch Nelson is an officer without war experience but with a charisma and intellect that ensures that this impossible operation is fully successful. He manages to convince a general after he interrupted him several times during his briefing (apparently this is not done in the US Army). And he manages to persuade an Afghan warlord in a decisive manner so he forgets a year-long feud for a short time and buries the battle ax briefly. ""12 Strong"" is certainly exciting, contains a whole series of action-packed scenes and shows in a clear way how chaotic the political situation in that country is. My personal opinion about the whole problem is of a very different nature. And many will disagree with it. Let me put it this way. I am convinced that as long as there is money to be earned from these sad conflicts, with ordinary and innocent people being the victims, these tragic conflicts won't stop and nothing will change.

40,AudioFileZ,Much Better Than The Negative Reviews,7,5 April 2018,"12 Strong is based on truth and it would seem that in itself goes a long way as it took until a decade later for this story to become known through the book on which it was based. Quite simply it deserves the big screen treatment as it was a first victory in a war which goes on as I write this. The heroism is off the charts as everything changed the minute the 12 dropped in. Importantly the movie gets this point across. If it often seems like a lunatic's gamble as the small group of 12 immediately were split due the lack of trust by the Northern Alliance's war lord. Again the movie pulls no Hollywood bombast in depicting this. It seems like even our supposed allies are so distrustful the operation is doomed. As far as the battle scenes go there's that suspicion it may have received some of the Hollywood action movie push. I say don't over analyze this as it gets the point across of how desperate the situation really was and how focused, disciplined, and well trained our brave 12 were. The bottom line is this is a good homage based on real events and that always hovers large. If it could have been better depicted I'm certainly not sure exactly how as the victory was near impossible and that is captured on film quite realistically. I have nothing but praise for these fearless 12 warriors and I'm proud their story is now displayed for all of us who they put it over the line for.

-Army Of One With the new year starting, 12 strong opens the gate for action movies this January. Fans of military dramas will be entertained by the fast pace of the film, outside the first hour, once the bombs and guns begin to roar. Interspersed between the battles, is a rich dialogue that is broken into categories that represent: natural conversation between teammates, military jargon to get you caught up in the action, and more importantly an honorable exchange of words that represent cultures well. The messages in this movie are charge up with the special effects of Hollywood, and with it a great presentation of the cultural dynamics in war. And of course, there is plenty of action to keep things intense and exciting, laden with all the war time theatrics that portray the American Hero we all love to see. 
 Sadly, 12 Strong suffers from too little editing and trying to get everything into one movie. Much of the length comes from trying to cover every detail of the war, including such small gimmicks as an air drop gone wrong. These moments are immersive, but add little to the movie that couldn't be read in a book. Any details of the soldiers' lives are rushed over, feeling incomplete and irrelevant to the story, a shame given that these components could have helped each member of the team stand out. Unfortunately, the cast of this movie look very similar, with only a few visual features to help them stand out from each other. Chris Hemsworth is the man who gets most of the attention, with the studio relying quite heavily on him in both character development and action fields. The other members got their pitches in, but they weren't as strong as the captain of the group. 
 While not the best war movie to grace the silver screen, it still has plenty of theater worthy qualities that make this worth a visit. It's an exciting, special effects spectacle complete with cultural prowess and band of brotherhood moments that you like to see in these movies. And while it paints the pictures of heroes, the movie needed some more fine tuning to really get all 12 heroes the portrayal they deserved. A little more development and a little less time at the opening may have further strengthened this movie, but ha good shot nonetheless.",12 Strong

46,Abdulxoxo,Solid war flick,6,26 January 2021,"This film has a solid cast. Chris Hemsworth in the lead role does a commendable job. The actual storytelling hangs on the interesting and conflict-filled relationship between Cap. Mitch and the Northern Alliance's leader A. R. Dostum which is good but it quickly became stale. the initial character set-ups involving family members and relationships are quite boring. I also find Sgt. Milo's befriending of an Afghani boy to be pointless. But the film is visually and technically stunning. The special effects and practical effects are superb in this flick. The action are intense and gripping; the battle sequences, the bombing runs and the teamwork displayed by the American troops are spectacular. They only have horses and a rifle-armed militia to fight the Taliban with tanks and rocket launchers. But they managed to outsmart them with aerial attacks and superior ground tactics. So much incessant gunfire, constant reloading, and RPG explosions. The film will keep the average viewer on the edge of their seat, with eyes fixed on the screen. Cinematographer Rasmus Videbæk makes frequent, effective use of filters to dampen hues and enhance the grittiness of the film's visual appearance. Lorne Balfe's score is generally effective, although there are times when it calls attention to itself a little too much.
Overall, 12 strong, despite solid action, good visuals and performances, the script left much to be desired and doesn't make the most of the talent involved.",12 Strong

53,bankofmarquis,A missed opportunity,6,24 January 2018,"12 STRONG had an interesting premise going for it - the true life, just released, top secret mission of the first Special Forces unit to be deployed in Afghanistan following the 9/11 terrorist attack. All set to conduct ""traditional"" warfare, these soldiers must learn to adapt to a different sort of war being waged in the caves and cliffs surrounding them - including fighting tanks while on horseback! And...with charismatic screen performers like Chris Hemsworth, Michael Pena, Trevante Rhodes, and (especially) Michael Shannon, the ingredients were there for a strong film.Unfortunately, Director Nicolai Fuglsig (in what is, in essence, his big screen debut as a Director) and Writers Ted Tally and Peter Craig squander this opportunity and present a fairly bland, fairly generic action/adventure flick reminiscent of the Chuck Norris Vietnam flicks of the 1980's (like MISSING IN ACTION or THE DELTA FORCE).Not only that, but with a film entitled 12 STRONG, you would expect the 12 soldiers to be an interesting group of characters (a la THE DIRTY DOZEN or ALIENS), unfortunately, this should have been called Chris Hemsworth plus 3 and a bunch of glorified extras. The lion's share of this film follows Hemsworth's rookie Captain develop into a ""warrior"". This is an interesting character played by a charismatic actor and would have been more interesting had we not spent a vast majority of the film with him. After awhile I wanted to yell at the screen - ""All right! I get it! He has to learn how to kill without losing his humanity"". Also featured in this group are Michael Pena as the ""Gung-Ho GI"" of the group (with a smart mouth, of course) and Trevante Rhodes (following his breakout performance in MOONLIGHT) who befriends a young, local boy (you can guess how that goes). Both of these character arcs play out rather predictably. But the biggest sin in this film is the misuse of the great Michael Shannon as the 2nd in command. Perhaps Shannon's schedule did not allow more use of him, but he was barely in this film and what time he was used it was well below his abilities of an actor - a major disappointment.To this film some slack, the action is serviceable which makes it worth watching - an element that elevates this mediocre film to something just north of that.If you're looking for an escape from the January cold, you could do worse, an enjoyable - enough - 2 hours in the theater.Letter Grade: B-6 (out of 10) stars and you can take that to the Bank(OfMarquis)",12 Strong

Here's the rest of what you probably need to know: These 12 Army special forces soldiers (played by, among others, Chris Hemsworth, Michael Peña, the great Michael Shannon, Trevante Rhodes and the underrated Geoff Stults) become the first American troops to strike back against the Taliban in Afghanistan after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. Barely a month after the Towers came down, two Army officers (Rob Riggle and William Fichtner) choose this group of men to link up with a northern Afghan warlord (Navid Negahban) to attack the important city of Mazar-e-Sharif. / This film has a lot in common (and compares very well with) another film released in mid-January of 2016, ""13 Hours: The Secret Soldiers of Benghazi"". Both films give us heroes to cheer for and plenty of intense action, while mining the backgrounds of the men involved - and their complex interpersonal relationships - for considerable emotional impact.

56,kjproulx,A Solid Flick With A Great Cast,7,8 February 2018,"Everyone knows that once the Twin Towers were attacked on September 11, 2001, soldiers went into battle and wars have been occurring ever since. That part is well-known by everyone around the world. These wars will soon be talked about in history classes if they aren't already, so it goes without question that films will be made about certain aspects of the war, due to the significant impact that it has left and continues to leave. The story that 12 Strong presents is something that has been classified until recently, so it should be quite the surprise to many. There are many aspects about this film that follow the standard war film formula, but as long as it's supported by a solid cast, great sequences, and solid direction, the premise itself should be enough to carry its audience, and I believe it does just that. Now playing in theatres, here's why I think 12 Strong deserves a watch, even if not immediately.Following the first twelve men that stood up to make the first attacks after the collapse of the Twin Towers back in 2001, this movie explores the true story of courage and ambition that these men displayed for the world. As a film, it does feel slightly formulaic, due to the fact that it pretty much takes you from one location to another in a fairly simple way, but I can also see this being exactly what went down in reality, so I was able to forgive that flawed aspect pretty quickly. This is a film about intensity and the characters surrounding that intensity and for that, it succeeds with flying colors.From Chris Hemsworth to Michael Pena, Michael Shannon to a fair newcomer in Trevante Rhodes (whom I loved in 2016's Moonlight), this is a stacked film. I always appreciate when a movie delivers crazy amounts of action, while also finding the time to slow down and give each character their moments to shine. No, the character development here isn't anything to write home about, but I have to admit that I was wrapped up in each of their stories. Simple moments of characters sitting by a fire and reminiscing gets to me if it's done well, and 12 Strong accomplishes these feats quite well.This movie definitely isn't for the faint of heart in terms of gore or being turned off by too much action, because when this movie wishes to display its reign of terror on the people who have some sort of involvement in the terrorist attacks, 12 Strong does it in a very visceral manner. From showing executions to showing towns being bombed, I found this movie to be a fresh dose of reality to people who seem to forget about the horrors that go on around the world on a daily basis. As I said, there's nothing spectacular about this movie, but I think it's a little more important than people are making it out to be.Although director Michael Bay hit a high point in his career with the film 13 Hours (at least in my opinion), I feel that 12 Strong is a film that shows real promise for director Nicolai Fuglsig. This is his first mainstream outing, and I have to call it as I see it and say that I believe this man knows how to portray action on-screen and I can't wait to see the progression of his career as a filmmaker. In terms of action, I would recommend keeping an eye on this name for the future. Overall, 12 Strong is a solid and important war flick when it comes to the core story and I believe everyone should check it out at some point, but I could also recommend quite a few better movies in the same genre. Impressive filmmaking, but just good as a whole.",12 Strong

65,stevenrotherforth,Sadly it's just a perfectly serviceable action movie,6,14 October 2018,"12 StrongLet's be honest, we aren't short of war movies.
The genre is over stocked.
Some of these movies have reached the dizzy heights of greatness but there's been some stinkers too!
12 Strong leans more to the good.
History books are full of stories to tell and the story of the twelve soldiers who where the first deployed into Afghanistan after 9/11 is certainly one worth telling.
Led by a new captain played by Chris Hemsworth his special forces team must work with an Afghan warlord to take down the Taliban.Nicolai Fuglsig's film tells an important story but does so with no real vigour.
Don't get me wrong this is by no means a bad or boring film, it just never really ignites into anything special.
It's a perfectly serviceable war movie but I got the feeling that the story of these twelve heroes was never done justice.
In parts 12 Strong is slow and cumbersome.
When the action does kick in it is done effectively and with a level of skill.
Ariel shots are sublime.
The dropping of bombs is both destructive yet beautiful at the same time because the cinematography is so captivating. The use of colour is sparsely splashed across the screen to give the entire picture a look of desolation.
Sound is also very good as it should be. This is a war movie. We need the bangs!Essentially that's the problem with 12 Strong. We get the bangs for our buck but there's not enough character development for me to care about these men.
Of course I do, but apart from Hemsworth's character there's not enough insight invested into the rest of the team.
This is where this film should have shone.
Unlike say Dunkirk which was criticised for its lack of character development, but that film was more of a running commentary. We the audience was thrown into the action with soldiers in Nolan's film. There was no time for pleasantries. It was a duck and cover movie.
12 Strong wants you to get to know it's characters and spends a lethargic first act skipping over the subject offering us not enough insight.
Instead 12 Strong becomes a fairly enjoyable action movie that has grounded and believable action.
This is no Rambo First Blood Part II.
You do get the sense that these men are in real danger, they're not larger than life superheroes. They're real people fighting a very real war.
I can recommend this movie. It's a film that has its highs and lows. Sadly the highs are the action scenes and not the development of its real heroes.
Sadly this is why unlike great movies such as Saving Private Ryan it won't stay in the memory banks for very long.",12 Strong
66,coreyjdenford,Moderately strong,6,26 January 2018,"This review of 12 Strong is spoiler free*** (3/5)BRAVERY, POWER AND strength take their hold through the plot of Jerry Bruckheimer's produced true telling war drama 12 Strong, based on the alleged declassified mission when CIA Paramilitants and American Special Forces would join forces and invade Afghanistan after the events of 9/11 to kill the Taliban. 
 
However those points aren't just the central nail for the plot, they're also what carries the film through its pulsating action. Sure this idea is often clankingly direct as the film progresses, yet it gives a scent of the decent layout through its 130 minute running time. However, despite the robustly delivered action and an interesting big-name cast helming it, this core idea sadly falls to the straightforward storytelling of patriotic heroism and a weak script which often has it's actors talking through bombastic poster taglines and not really much else. 
 
Saying that though, there's obviously a reason why Bruckheimer attached himself to the film, maybe it's the core material based on Doug Stanton's novel 12 Horses, or perhaps it's the bravery of a dirty dozen who take a chance and fight back - it could also be the chance to do something other than the recently botched plotting of the Pirates of the Caribbean series. It could, in fact, be all of them that gained his attraction, the attraction of Danish first-time director Nicolai Fuglsig and the talented cast. Chris Hemsworth (taking a break from the MCU) plays Captain Mitch Nelson, a man with limited combat experience, who's mostly bunged-up behind a desk, he and his trusty lieutenant (Michael Shannon) are given the task to fight in Afghanistan where they'll be tied with their foreign general (Navid Negahban). 
 
While the sandy dozen tour through the gorgeous desert backdrop, there are a few Sergio Leone-ish action scenes - of horse, guns, tanks and giant explosions clashing together. It's an entertaining war-drama which has keen intentions happily carried through its core performances - sadly the action, though stunning, especially with an explosion taking up half the screen, it isn't anything we haven't already seen before. And it's that thinking where the action often falls to repetition, it's almost as if the editor left during production and recycled the same material. 
 
Still, that said, 12 Strong boasts stunning cinematography, a big name producer and a hefty cast all with brilliant performances there's even a surprise dramatic turn by Rob Riggle. All are big with their intentions to grasp the powerful premise and to grasp the true intentions of bravery from the core material - yet the truth is the film sadly loses another point for lacking in characterization. Indeed it has problems through its forgettable plot it's an entirely brazen film that comes with power, the determination of odds and a strong heart. 
 
VERDICT Invigorating action and a solid cast lead in this fact-based war film that sadly loses its way from limited character a soft core and an underwhelming story.",12 Strong
67,Ramascreen,Hardcore Battle Scenes,8,17 January 2018,"12 STRONG has some of the most hardcore battle scenes in any war movie. It's soldiers carrying weapons while riding horses, that definitely makes this one unique. And if you're animal lovers, you are right to be concerned about the horses' safety, I'm sure the production went above and beyond to ensure that but to me what's more impressive is the fact that these guys actually storm into battle like that, with bullets flying everywhere, riding a horse isn't exactly taking a cover, it's very very vulnerable, you're out in the open, impressive stuff.Starring Chris Hemsworth, Michael Shannon, Michael Pena and Trevante Rhodes, directed by Nicolai Fuglsig, based on Doug Stanton's book, 12 STRONG is the true story of a U.S. Special forces team led by their new captain, Mitch Nelson, played by Chris Hemsworth, and after 9/11 they're sent to be the first troops into Afghanistan to retaliate. There they form alliance with a local general, played by Navid Negahban in order to fight their common enemy, the Taliban. The special forces team has to adapt to the terrain and some of the tactics there which means they have to use Afghani horses to go places. They're outnumbered and outgunned by a ruthless enemy who's driven by ideology. Without sounding too shallow, to be honest with you, the biggest reason why I enjoy 12 STRONG is that it's essentially about good guys kicking bad guys' ass. The war in Afghanistan is one of the longest wars in our country's history with no end in sight, it's still going, it's still happening, so seeing it from today's perspective is quite depressing. But something like this, where the characters are charged up because of 9/11, they go in, guns blazing, sending hell to enemy's territory, they go in they get the job done, boom, it definitely satisfies those of us moviegoers who like watching bad guys getting what's coming to them. And I'm glad that the movie is rated R and doesn't hold back, so what you get is a depiction that's not watered down. It's graphic, it's intense, it's brutal, it's in your face. And like I said earlier, the battle scenes are explosive and hardcore. You're really engaged the entire time. It's well staged, well choreographed and well-shot, with some excellent sound mix and sound editing work. There's a bit of drama they throw in there with the clash between how Chris Hemsworth's character does things versus how the local general Navid Negahban's character does things, so even though the bad guy is quite one dimensional, there's plenty to go around between those two commanding characters. The movie does a good job of emphasizing the reason why a group like the Taliban needs to be eliminated, it does a good job of pumping us up to keep rooting for the good guys to win. What a helluva film to honor those courageous horse soldiers. -- Rama's Screen --",12 Strong

They used to see the WTC in pictures of NYC's skyline, in movies, videogames, from the airport, then boom, it was all gone. People couldn't believe this happened in America.

The goal was to get Bin Laden and correct the injustice the Taliban were inflicting onto their own people. The History Channel only broadcast shows about the Taliban every week, back when it was basically Pentagon propaganda and not a reality TV/bad history drama station.There was basically no effort to let anyone know this was 2001. Anything from CRT monitors, cellphones to cultural oddities, hairstyles, was left out.Unfortunately, like Black Hawk Down, the movie, I think this was basically another Pentagon sponsored movie focused on being Army recruiting and war promotion to the public than telling a truthful story.

All the American warriors going to Afghanistan are so patriotic and macho in a good way (yet tender and loving to their families) than you can't help but like and respect them.The cast is very nice too, starting with the star Chris Hemsworth who has gathered fame with all these hot ""Thor"" superhero movies and always makes a good action man because of his buffed-up body and tendency to look slightly mad when his face is covered by dust, grease and/or blood... which tends to happen in war movies.There can only be one hero, of course, but we have also Michael Peña and William Fichtner (the always solid supporting men), and, er, all the other ones making up the American or local armed forces.And then there's Michael Shannon, thinking man's Hollywood star. As an actor, he's always had the best of both worlds really - this larger than life presence that just commands the attention when he's on screen but he's also smart and intelligent, being able to do any kind of project he damn well pleases.There's not enough of him in ""12 Strong"", because producers think Hemsworth needs to be central to everything, but then again, is there ever?Having watched some, you may notice that for a war movie, there's not a lot of action. In fact, you don't get any battles some 55 minutes have passed from the beginning.It's not just that war movies are notoriously expensive, the story is also character-based, so the emphasis is on the team members, their state of mind and relationship with local allied warriors who fight the same war but for very different reasons and with a different attitude.We see how being in a battlefield is, all this dust and mostly waiting and sitting around in your army pants, waiting for something to happen (which sounds a lot like my 20's, minus the dust and army pants).Then the battles happen, and I gotta say, they turn out to be not the strongest part of ""12 Strong"". I mean, they are as visually attractive as they come these days, but not standing out in any significant way, except maybe the good work of make-up department creating wounds on the bodies of actors. In short, nothing we haven't seen before enough times.The suspension never rises high enough because the American soldiers are mostly invulnerable and don't carry heavy losses.How invested can you be in a firefight where you just know that ""our guys"" are gonna be left standing? It feels like a videogame, not a authentic chaos of war.Sadly, the story which is meant to be the strongest part of ""12 Strong"" is actually not that strong too. It's always a'ight, but not delving deep enough into the characters or their relationships with local allies (although the contrast of two sides is one of the most important points in the story). Which makes it surprising to see how friendly they are in the end.Ultimately, it's perfectly OK war movie but it doesn't distinguish itself enough in any significant way, to really offer more than two hours worth of passive watching.The stakes might have been high in real life (it's based on true story), but they sure are only middling on the screen.I wish they'd used the original title ""Horse Soldiers"", it's more intriguing. But I guess ""12 Strong"" is a cleaner and better fit for a mainstream project.",12 Strong
71,ritera1,Meh!,6,20 May 2019,"Was not on my list to see and didn't find it especially attractive. In line with what I expected, though.I'm usually very entertained by gunfights and action. This was very conventional. The explosions were pretty impressive, though.Very much geared to the patriotic crowd, the flag wavers. Don't get me wrong. 9/11 was a terrible day and I don't want anyone to be killed by anything. But 17 years later and it seemed dated in its enthusiasm for THAT war, which was more a failure than anything.A bit disappointed that quality actors like Shannon and Pena would sign up for this. Hemmesworth really doesn't have range and only looked the part.Initially was Muslim bating from the subject matter to the brief depiction of the Taliban. Of course the Taliban were monsters and a'holes, but wasn't for another 30 minutes 'til it balanced itself out a bit vs. The Gen. Dotsum character. The other sympathetic element were the Taliban forcing innocent farmers to fight for them, as briefly described. Also Hemmesworth's ""first kill"" was examined in the scene afterwards, but also by-the-numbers. Any attempt to say ""war isn't pretty"" was brief and cursory vs. The cartoonish and over-the-top depiction of the many battle scenes. American Sniper did a much better job being anti-war, even though everyone was saying it was the opposite.Some very good actors on a good day, but this really wasn't a good day. A lot of action but barely acceptable directing from Nicolai Fuglsig, who per this site has next-to-no credits. I'd be curious on that story, as I've seen big movies given to new directors. But at least those directors did a string of short films.Of course it was ""based on a true story"" which I take with a grain of salt. Forgave it with All Is True recently, but that was astoundingly good. But even the cursory reading I did afterwards showed it took liberties.Miss it if you can.",12 Strong
72,austin0731,The problem with 'based on a true story' movies,6,8 June 2019,"12 Strong stars Chris Hemsworth in a movie about a team of American Soldiers who attempt to take down the taliban. And i was....ok, a decent movie with great chemistry amongst the main cast, good individual performances and immersive war action. However, the narrative doesn't do anyone much favours, these bio-pics that are supposedly based on real events really do struggle with creating drama and intensity because the real events are often not that interesting. I am not doubting the significance and sacrifices of the real people behind this very real event but from an entertainment standpoint there really wasn't much source material to create a wholesome narrative.Like many films of the same tagline this movie has that one punchline that the rest of the narrative has to surround, in this case '12 men' vs the taliban. It is an interesting story but not enough to be a feature length film, and it was a long movie over 2 hours. I definitely felt that run time, a lot of filler and unnecessary parts that built little character and barely progressing the story.

76,ivko,incredible story,7,18 May 2018,"This is the quasi-real story of the first days of the war in Afghanistan following 9/11, when a small team of special forces soldiers entered the country to support our new battle against the Taliban. I say quasi-real only because this is a Hollywood production, and there are almost inevitably changes made to amplify the drama and excitement no matter how exciting the real story was, but then again for all I know maybe it did go down exactly as depicted.In any case, the movie depicts how the American soldiers went in with very little information or planning and only a vague goal that boils down to ""support this guy because he's fighting these other guys"", and found themselves in a world where people are living with roughly the technological sophistication we had here about 150 years ago.It's not exact, of course, there are aspects of modern life here and there, but it's pretty stunning none the less. People live in structures without plumbing or electricity, travel on horseback, and communication is mostly done by face to face conversations or with walkies. In fact, the most common artifact of the modern world are the weapons.Speaking of, seeing the contrast between the so-called first world and life in Afghanistan the thing that struck me was just how much effort humanity has put into efficient ways of killing each other. Looking at a world where you live in a hut and keep a herd of sheep for clothing and food, now filled with tanks, surface to air rockets, grenades, machine guns, and bomber planes, I couldn't help but think of the monumental effort it took to create all of that. The tons of raw materials mined and refined, collected from around the world and passed through sophisticated factories where it was pressed and molded and assembled, the chemistry bent towards creating reliable mass-produced explosives, the advanced rocketry used to create handheld weapons capable of firing explosives thousands of feet with accuracy.It's kind of awe inspiring. Truly. It might actually be one of mankind's most impressive accomplishments. The ability to produce and transport such a bewildering array of lethal power, to bring it even here, about as far from anything resembling the modern world as it's possible to get, is pretty amazing.We tend not to think of war as an ""amazing"" thing because the effects are so horrifying, but when I saw this I wondered how many other areas we can say we've developed with such single-minded purpose. The cell phone is often held out as one of the main marvels of the modern world, but even that technology owes most of its existence to the military, where the core technology was built for more effective battlefield communication, as were most of the technologies it utilizes like GPS and the Internet.In any case, the movie is well made and paced, and it depicts a piece of the culture and history of a region many of us know very little about despite the fact that we've been engaged in a war there for years. I don't know if it was actually filmed in Afghanistan (my guess is probably not), but the cinematography is beautiful and seems authentic. Also, the stars are charismatic and engaging and the story is unique; it's worth a view.",12 Strong
77,rutzelb,Well Told,9,4 June 2018,"Predictable, yes, because it's a true story 
 I swore I wasn't going to watch movies or do reviews on Seal Team this and that and similar titles, but this one caught my eye because the mission was completed using horses in Afghanistan. Yes, horses. Yes, most of the movie is about a Green Beret Team of 12 that needs to capture this town and that town in Afghanistan to get to the objective Mazar-i-Sharif (Taliban Stronghold) which would put a serious crimp in Taliban operations. So we will see a lot of war fighting with CGI, of course, and these scenes are absolutely brilliant. Yes, we must keep in mind that this is not just a movie, but what we see on the screen had actually happened, maybe not in the exact same way, but happened nevertheless. We are looking at true heroes as we would have seen in those other war movies I chose not to watch. Because of the success of Seal Team 6, we will be inundated with these war movies for some time. The area of contention in here, besides all the fighting is the small war between Captain Mitch Nelson (Chris Hemsworth), the leader of the Green Berets and General Dostum (Navid Negahban), the leader of the Afghanistan Army (actually a tribal War Lord). They go at each other mostly because the General won't tell Captain Nelson all he needs to know. That spilling of info was a long time in coming, but it finally did. Then later they differed on strategy. Hey, can't have everything to run smoothly and this is a serious war, don't you know?The acting all around was excellent and very convincing . The cinematography and overall photography was stunning. Yes, they used horses to knock out the big missile battery and now there is statue of a Green Beret on a horse near the site where the Twin Towers used to be. Why? The 12 Green Berets that went on that mission were bound not to talk about it because it was a very classified mission. Also, this was the First foray into Afghanistan after the 911 attack. Now you know. Notables: William Fichtner as Col Mulholland who sent Captain Nelson on that mission even though Capt Nelson had never been in combat; Rob Riggle (Yes, that ""comedian"" on NFL Today) as LTC Bowers, Capt Nelson's Commander; Michael Pena as Sam Diller a key member of the Team; and Michael Shannon as Warrant Officer Hal Spenser, 2nd in command to Capt Nelson.Even though you know most things that happened, this is still worthwhile movie to see. The conversations between Capt Nelson and General Dostum are worth hearing. This is history and we must never forget 911 and the reason we went to war. (9/10)Violence: Yes. Sex: No. Nudity: No. Humor: Some. Language: Yes.

The action is dull and the scenes are messy and confusing. The logic is baffling and the tension is non-existent. After lots of pathetic non effective bombing runs you are left with a messy poorly filmed climax. Then it feels like they were late for a train and it ends.

But it has two redeeming qualities, in order of value: first, it devotes a fair share of time depicting Army Special Forces wrestling with performing their primary mission -- establishing rapport with indigenous fighters, and then working with those native fighters as force multipliers; second, it featured above-average combat scenes that are thankfully becoming more common in war movies of the last decade, regardless of which country produces them.

They tend to focus on negative portrayal of Afghans I didn't see that), overly positive portrayal of the special operators and cast doubts on the reliability of the plot.

Written by Ted Tally and Peter Craig, and directed by Nicolai Fuglsig, 12 Strong is based on the book Horse Soldiers (2009) by Doug Stanton. Unfortunately, epic battle scenes and a compelling real-life story aren't enough to rescue this film from its lackluster execution and direction.Green Beret Captain Mitch Nelson (Chris Hemsworth) is moving to a staff job when terrorists destroy the World Trade Center on September 11, 2001. With the help of Chief Warrant Officer 5 Hal Spencer (Michael Shannon), he convinces Lt. Colonel Max Bowers (Rob Riggle), Commander of 3rd Battalion, 5th Special Forces Group, to allow him to rejoin his team and deploy with Task Force Dagger against the Taliban and Al Qaeda in Afghanistan.In Uzbekistan, Captain Nelson convinces Colonel John Mulholland (William Fichtner) to allow his team to go in first by displaying confidence and a knowledge of Afghan history, despite never having served in combat. Prominent members of his team include SFC Sam Diller (Michael Peña) and SFC Ben Milo (Trevante Rhodes). Together, they must earn the trust of an unpredictable Afghan warlord, General Abdul Rashid Dostum (Navid Negahban), and help him defeat his Taliban rivals around the city of Mazar-i-Sharif using U.S. air power.Mullah Razzan (Numan Acar), leader of the Taliban forces, is a dark-haired, mustache-twirling villain who executes a woman early in the film for teaching young girls to read. After several confrontations and missteps, Captain Nelson wins Dostum's trust and together they overwhelm the Taliban in the ""Tiangi Gap"" and free Mazar-i-Sharif, mostly on horseback.This is Danish photojournalist and director Nicolai Fuglsig's sophomore effort, his first being a sci fi film he wrote, produced, and directed called Exfil (2017). A more experienced director probably could have crafted this story into something a bit more substantive. It falls victim to the same arcade-style action we've come to expect, and unnecessarily embellishes the truth to make events seem more incredible.I was disappointed to learn the events of the climactic battle are almost entirely made up. Real-life Capt. Mark Nutsch (Mitch Nelson in the film) told the Tampa Bay Times, ""This is a fictional portrayal - don't lose sight of that."" U.S. Green Berets didn't charge into the fight-they directed airstrikes from overwatches behind the frontlines.In real life, it took roughly nine hours for help to arrive, and this is explicitly stated several times in 12 Strong. However, when Hal Spencer is severely wounded in a suicide-grenade attack, a helicopter arrives within minutes after the battle to evacuate him to safety. That's because the incident is included for dramatic effect, and none of the team members were actually wounded.The climactic charge of the horse soldiers against two BM-21 ""Grad"" multiple rocket launchers also never happened. While the Taliban did have BM-21s at the Battle of Mazar-i-Sharif, they were destroyed by U.S. airstrikes. Still, seeing the rockets fire on screen was spectacular and an awesome visual effect.Overall, audiences generally liked this film, while critics gave it a lukewarm reception (72% versus 54% on Rotten Tomatoes). It delivers on the action and drama, and even attempts a nuanced portrayal of U.S.-Afghan relations, but something misfired along the way. 12 Strong ultimately comes across as formulaic and uninspiring, which is a shame because no Americans come closer to being real life heroes than these soldiers. They deserve a little better than a generic action film.",12 Strong

Anyways, if you wish to make a good propaganda movie learn from the WW2 propaganda movies cause they were way better (evil NAZIS helped in that to be fair). 12 Strong is a waste of a good movie budget.",12 Strong

107,reisen55,No review here but an opinion,8,27 January 2018,"I cannot watch this film and for less obvious reasons - for I am a survivor of the South Tower. Worked for Aon and walked down from the 101st floor that morning. Certain films, events, take me back to The Towers and this would be a hard one to watch, same as Flight 93 was. Other films as less impactful to me and some, like THE WALK, mean nothing. I sense here, though, that a viewing would be followed by more than a few stiff drinks. So for those of us who were THERE that day ..... salute the film but have to say been there, and did that in a profound way. BTW Aon lost 176 people that morning 19 of which I knew personally.",12 Strong

It's an astonishing true story and I am happy they erected a horse soldier at the World Trade Center to honor these men. There is some comic relief banter which helps alleviate the stressful situations they find themselves in. I'm writing this review because I can't believe anyone would give this less than a 7. These men are heroes and I'm happy their story is being told. Well done!,12 Strong
110,Scarefish,2 Long,1,28 January 2018,"This is probably the worst war biopic I've ever seen, excluding thoroughly fictionalized ones such as Michael Bay's Pearl Harbor. In fact, I would hesitate to even call Bay's more recent war film, 13 Hours, a bad film as it at least had a compelling story and fully realized characters that I cared about in spite of it's many shortcomings.This film is cheesier than the average 80's action flick. Every line of dialogue feels like it came off a script, and not a very clever one at that. It feels like there are dozens of lines in the film from every major character that are delivered with the desperate intention to become quotes.The main character especially comes off as unreasonably brash. During the introduction, he immediately gives his superiors attitude following the September 11th attacks, and subsequently throws a tantrum, kicking over his desk to protest against his promotion, and immediately gets what he wants for being an impatient manchild, though the movie intended me to get the impression that this guy's valiant and brave. Despite no combat experience, he's confident that he and his team are coming back alive after kicking some terrorist asses, and they're gonna look dope doin' it.At no point did I feel any tension. Unlike just about every other film of the genre, the soldiers aren't shown as having fear despite lazily uttered lines claiming they do. Characters charge into battle constantly, like birds with their chests puffed up, to such a blatant degree that it's surprising that they weren't going to subvert this trope and found it simply acceptable. There's hardly any struggle for victory in this film, as it feels the good guys are chasing the baddies down like dogs and bombarding them from a distance with air strikes over and over. It's like 300, except with modern weaponry, and less tact, and no style. The American soldiers feel invincible, and they pretty much are as they survive several close-proximity explosions while baddies are turned to red mist, hoist by their own petards. There's no attempt made to surprise viewers, and oddly enough it tries its best to be comfortable and digestible. Though it can be argued that too many films nowadays are dark and gritty, there's a place for that tone, and war films are definitely the place to stick to that. The best war films are the ones that tend to delve deep into the horrors of war, but this film would rather be a positive idea rather than a though-provoking experience. It is easy to evoke strong sympathy for characters of a war film, especially when they're based on true events, but this film misses the mark entirely.The story isn't all that interesting to begin with. There's good intentions here, which are likely more apparent in the novel they skimmed through in making this adaptation, but ultimately it comes off as the less interesting spin-off in the events surrounding 9/11 and the war in the Middle East. United 93 has an incredible narrative, and it manages to make the most of its incredibly compelling story of real-world heroism while remaining respectful and realistic. 13 Hours, while very flawed, tells the politically controversial story of the Benghazi attacks on the 11th anniversary of 9/11. Zero Dark Thirty tells the story of assassinating Osama Bin Laden and is critically acclaimed. This film feels kind of like Pearl Harbor if that movie skipped the part where Pearl Harbor was attacked and instead focused on Hiroshima.The editing is sloppy at best. There are many instances of blood squibs that look very digital which cheapen the movie and make it look like a video game at parts. Numerous smoke, fire, and explosion effects also looked quite fake, and resolutions of objects seemed inconsistent. Sometimes objects and backgrounds looked blown up and low-detail or even skewed vertically in contrast to the foreground characters, leading me to believe they must have been chroma-keyed in, poorly. There are annoyingly useless and repetitive clips, such as the needless cuts to the Jafar-esque villain of the film giving menacing stares at our heroes, which add nothing to the plot or characters and just act as padding in an already paper-thin story for an extremely bloated movie.Also, this may be an error on my theater's part, but the audio was out of sync. Characters' lips were moving about a quarter of a second behind the actual audio, though it wouldn't be unlikely that something went wrong beyond the filmmaking itself, so I won't hold this against the film as of yet.The humor was cringeworthy at best. There's jokes and gags tossed in here and there which are thankfully not too frequent, but while they're intended for levity they come off as immature and inappropriate, especially given this movie's not depressing and thus doesn't require any levity. One character says he's hungry despite there being no word of this and nothing to hint to anyone in the crew being famished at this point, and he ends up buying a sheep off a local for $300, just to execute a punchline that this guy should be working for military commission, and instead of getting a scene with the crew eating a sheep and allowing for character interaction we skip to more boring military discussion followed by one of the longest action sequences I've ever seen in a movie.This movie lacks any passion and is simply a paint-by-numbers war flick with no more intention than cashing in on the lowest common denominators, and it will impress none other than the least demanding moviegoers.",12 Strong

114,iNickR,Good But Could Have Been Better,5,18 January 2018,"In short: ""12 Strong"" is based on the book ""Horse Soldiers"" by Doug Stanton. In the weeks following 9/11 an elite squad of soldiers from the Army's Fifth Special Forces Group were flown into Afghanistan and dropped behind enemy lines. Their mission: work with a local, CIA-paid warlord, Gen. Abdul Rashid Dostum, and his ""Northern Alliance forces"", defeat the Taliban, and secure the strategic city of Mazar-i-Sharif.Whoopsy, no one told this group of ""12 Strong"" American badasses, led by Captain Mitch Nelson (Thor himself, Chris Hemsworth), that the fight will have to be done on horseback. Oh, and ""you have six-weeks to do it."" Says Thor: ""We'll do it in three.""If you're expecting an action-packed two-hours, you'll be disappointed. When the action does eventually start, it moves quickly from location to location with carpet-bombing-B-52's doing most of the heavy-lifting. Sure, it's fun to watch American air-superiority blow the shit out of the Taliban, but I paid to see Chris Hemsworth, Michael Shannon, Michael Peña and Trevante Rhodes (Moonlight) gallop and shoot their way to glory. But, this is a true story and the truth can be anti climactic sometimes.Two things you'll LIKE about ""12 Strong"": 1) Although the action scenes are short, they are awesomely intense and loud. 2) This is a guy movie. There isn't much in the way of romance, only bromance (if you're female, well, there is Chris Hemsworth but you may as well stay at home with the book version and a bottle of Chardonnay).Two things you'll DISLIKE: 1) There's a lot of reading to do. It seems like every five-minutes the team is going from Taliban stronghold to stronghold and apparently we need to know exactly who is who and where they are, in white bold, CAPS-LOCKED titles on the screen. 2) There's no emotion, and very little chemistry between the characters.",12 Strong

117,CobertNeede,"Sloppy, Misguiding ; but don't understand all the extreme hate",6,12 April 2018,"12 strong at best, is a pretty ok above average war movie. As much as people wanna say that it is a good guy/bad guy movie and that it is a classic american propaganda movie, they should also realize that despite all these cons they did craft a more than a 'boring' or a 'dull' film. I, for one had very low expectations for this. Chris Hemsworth's casting for starters. Chris will forever be labelled as the guy who plays 'Thor' and that label hasn't gone off here too. Many critics and reviewers might undermine this film for the casting and general tone of this film alone. 12 Strong starts with the usual sequence that most war movies starts with. A more than predictable story and plot development makes the film a tad uninteresting throughout. With frequent interruptions of 'scholarly advice' and 'fight with heart' dialogues make us cringe and wonder whether this film has something redeeming ; to praise for. Chris's acting was a surprise. Never i would have expected to someone so typecasted to come out with some good piece of acting. 12 strong never suffers from a lack of action or adrenaline rushing moments. In fact, it is one of the few pros that should be mentioned. The slick, undetermined action, but pretty predictable one at that makes it a good thing that stands out from a pile of bad thorns. The film, even produced as a true story never makes it believable. The screenplay looks like it was borrowed from a Chinese robot designed to produce cliched screenplays. The lack of character development, the pretty straightforward interactions and dialogues and a vague, boring reactions to development that rarely take place make the film look like a full on dump. With some right guidance on how a war film (a real incident at that) should be scripted and directed, 12 strong could have been, potentially a good flick. Even with all the cliches and no original content to produce 12 strong stands on its own as a stagnant, rock solid, sloppy flick.",12 Strong
118,northernpaladin,Granite jawed jingoism,6,29 October 2021,"Now I'm not doubting these guys existed or downplaying their killing abilities but that is really all you get.The basic plot of US special forces/green berets going to Afghanistan immediately after
9/11 and joining up with an Afghan commander (General Dostrum) to defeat the Taliban is simple enough and that bare outline is true enough it would seem.Left to it's own devices this could have been a worthy testament to the skills of the Americans and a rare chance to focus on the Afghans fighting alongside them and doing the dying, instead we have Hemsworth being, well, Hemsworth, spouting some pretty poor duty and honour dialogue which in some scenes is just cringeworthy. We have no real idea what this guy is about or why his men follow him, similarly with Shannon's grizzled veteran who is obviously placed there as some kind of counter point but his considerable acting abilities are just wasted. As for everyone else, they are just walking through a series of constructs aiming for the pay cheque at the end. The real failure is to recognise who the hell General Dostrum was and his place in modern Afghan history, instead we have a caricature that belongs to a different era of film making.In terms of the battles it starts well and does at least show that the real battle winner was the ability of these guys to call in massive air support. However in the final battle where we have Hemsworth leading a cavalry charge of Dostrum's men against truck borne rocket launchers ""before they reload"" is ludicrous these things fire into the sky, they can't be levelled so charge whenever you like. In fact this whole overly long final act is what spoilt the film for me, it is riddled with cliches and inaccuracies; we have Russian BMP's referred to as tanks when they're not, we have actual tanks referred to as T72's when there were no T72's in Afghanistan, we have Hemsworth firing an M4A1 single handed from horse back and hitting everytime including at a guy firing a tank turret machine gun straight at him, the scenes of Hemsworth and co' up close on charging horses are clearly on rigs not horses, really embarrassing and in the aftermath of the battle the amount of destroyed armour littering the field is just way over the top and to some extent devalues the victory.If you want a bit of flag waving and bonding and stuff blowing up then go for it but there are better films set in this conflict out there.",12 Strong

The incessant action sequences all blend into one and it feels like one big turkey shoot; perhaps it was really like that, but I very much doubt it. It's a good story, more so because it's based on real-life events, but the incessant pace never really gives time for the viewer to breath. The tone is consistently too glossy, even when horrible events are portrayed. Consequently it fails to be hard-hitting, and lacks tension or real grit.

121,HK_Key-Si_HK,The strength of 12 Strong lies simply in the raw intensity when all hell breaks loose.,7,23 March 2018,"12 Strong shows you more of the raw aspects of war and you can't really compare this movie to Saving Private Ryan or similar war flicks. Here things are getting serious and there is no beautiful storyline that makes you feel for the personal lives of the soldiers. Sure, most of them have families, kids... people to go back home after the mission is finished, but these smaller details get brushed off in a very rushed way. All you, as the audience, have to care about are the soldiers fulfilling their duty to retaliate after 9/11 took place and kick some Taliban accross the field. To make it easier for us to relate to the characters we get Mr. Thor himself with Chris Hemsworth in the leading role, who does a great job on acting though. In this constant grind of war this movie slows down from time to time and tries to give some more depth to the other men of the 12 man strong team, but in many aspects this turns out very genereric and some of this fans of war movies have seen over and over again. The strength of 12 Strong lies simply in the raw intensity when all hell breaks loose and in these moments the movie scores big time. So if you only care for that you will love this movie. But if you want some more in depth character development and a rollercoaster of emotions, you might end up being slightly disappointed.",12 Strong
122,regula1,"An adequate interpretation of events, but lacks depth",6,19 January 2018,"The story of the Horse Soldiers, a group of twelve Special Forces soldiers who were sent into Afghanistan in the weeks following the 9/11 attacks to lay the groundwork for the Taliban's downfall, forced to ride horses against tanks and rockets, is an extraordinary tale of heroism against inconceivable odds and a proud moment in the history of our armed forces.While this film tries, and mostly succeeds in retelling these events, there's just something off in the way the whole thing is packaged.First off, there's the characters, mainly the three big names: Chris Hemsworth as Captain Mitch Nelson, Michael Shannon as Chief Warrant Officer Cal Spenser, and Michael Peña as Sergeant First Class Sam Diller. Their motivations and development is done only to the bare minimum, with Hemsworth being the only one with a true character arc. Of the other nine soldiers in the team, only three or four actually get their names spoken more than a couple of times throughout the film. The main supporting character is Navid Negahban as Afghan General Dostum, who provides most of the character drive for Hemsworth's Nelson to change. He has a couple of powerful moments, but he is sopposed to be portraying one of three Afghan commanders who are fighting the Taliban, but also would fight each other if the chance arose. This conflict is only brought up in passing, though it is built up multiple times.Then there's the main reason the story of the Horse Soldiers is so extraordinary: the fact that these twelve soldiers and a few hundred Afghan tribal warriors had to face fifty thousand Taliban and al-Qaeda fighters, facing off tanks and artillery on horseback.The battle scenes are well shot, with only a handful of scenes with excessive cuts. The final horse charge is especially well done and feels earned. However, they don't seem to convey these overwhelming odds as well as they could. With all of this being said, this film leaves me with the same feeling that World Trade Center (2006) did. Both of these films portray events and people under extraordinary circumstances accurately, more or less, but it just feels like those involved in both films were just going through the motions, trying to replicate feelings around events that may never be able to be truly replicated.All in all, 12 Strong is a thoroughly average depiction of extraordinary events, not bad but not great. You're probably better off reading the book on which this film is based.",12 Strong

Meh. So we saw this because I like a good war movie based on a true story, which this is. It didn't disappoint. Is it Saving Private Ryan level good? No. While the battle scenes are intense, it isn't as unsparing and conflicted as SPR. They have a mission and you cheer them on to fulfill it, end of. The acting is very good, even if it seems the director could have asked more of them. The humor could have been a bit darker, but it's still deftly handled and genuine. I love the actor who plays the Northern Alliance leader, and how he and Hemsworth's character evolve in their relationship. And the final battle scene is crazy!!! Horses and modern weaponry together?

I recently saw and enjoyed The Shape Of Water, The Phantom Thread, Jumanji, and Paddington 2. Not into war films. I went to the theater to see The Post and it was sold out. So, I picked 12 Strong at random, seeing Chris Hemsworth on the poster. Hey, it's Thor!. I never saw any trailers for this movie so I went in blind.Based on a true story, 12 Strong gripped me from the beginning because it explained everything slow enough for people like me who aren't into warfare. You meet the characters, you know what they are about to get into, and because 9/11 happened in my lifetime, I was suddenly drawn into this movie, which depicts the first group of soldiers who attacked the Taliban.You are told how long this team of soldiers have to accomplish their mission. They say they can do it in half the time. Once the mission starts, you get a constant count of the days that they are on the mission throughout the film. It's a nice timer that helps give you a feel of their progress. It's sometimes tense, and when it's not, you get a lot of development between characters that creates sympathy. It's always entertaining.When the final scenes play out, it's very, very intense, with lots of terror, lots of anxiety-inducing moments, but all in all, an extremely satisfying conclusion. The bottom line is, this is based on a true story of a team of 12 soldiers whose story was classified until now. So only now are they getting praised for their heroic deeds. This movie delivered a great, uplifting story of soldiers who were not given credit when they came home from duty. This is their due. I promise you, if you like action films like Jumanji, which I thought was awesome... this movie will NOT dissapoint, and it's based on a true story. I will DEFINITELY see this again in the theater.

At least the 10 last minutes kind of saved the film, the big fight at the end was what we wanted from the movie, what we saw in the trailer but sadly this is the only great scenes we had.

So basically the cast are great but don't have that much screentime, only Hemsworth (Thor) has screentime and all he does of it is great yet what he asked to do in the movie is bad, his character is bad and doesn't do much interesting things just thinks and talks that's it! Don't go watch that movie if you're hoping for a big war movie it ain't it feels more like a documentary which isn't bad but wasn't what I wanted to see.

I liked the fact that they were forced to use horses in their mission while calling in airstrikes from American warplanes. This is a military story of courage and determination reminiscent of the great tales of World War II. Good cast and plenty of action in the forbidding landscape of Afghanistan.,12 Strong

140,vincent-malisse,This glass was half empty,5,27 February 2018,"Perhaps this movie is more personal if you're from the USA, but I found the story empty and unmoving. There is little character placement, little story and the general message seems confusing. In addition, the realism in pulling this of and the politics behind each decision seems very unlikely to me.The actors put down a solid performance, but the story behind each character is missing. There was no sense in what drives or motivates them in doing what they do or why they want to follow their captain in battle. Sure, you have the 9/11 attack as a ""drive"", but I could not shake of the feeling they were more playing ""cowboy"" than taking revenge on the attack. The dread of having an all out war if they would not take the city also felt like missing the mark. The idea is there, but it does not deliver.On visuals this movie is excellent: the scenery is very nice and the action takes you right on the spot in the battle field, yet again I felt like, as is the case in may more movies, that understanding in being a ""warrior"" instead of a ""soldier"" has more to do with running stupidly and blindly across the battle field all hero-like, than with common sense.12 Strong failed in delivering and if you want to see a good movie of a war against all odds, go see 300.",12 Strong

The A list cast consisting of Chris Hemsworth, Michael Shannon, And Michael Pena along with others add a good and familiar face to this gritty war drama. Everyone giving good performances across the board even the minor characters and generic soldiers shown throughout the movie as well. The overall story is clear cut and set up within the first 20 minutes and holds strongly throughout. With some Cliches scattered throughout the film that could be clouded over since it is based off of true events. Some of the scenes did feel discriminating with its depictions of americans and the towns and locations throughout. Shockingly there weren't that many action/war as shown in the trailers and promotions for the film but the biggest battle is definitely the most intense with it's feeling of threat and danger most for our cast. But the big battle did have continuity errors throughout with recycled shots of headshots, missile firing and people coming in and out of cover shooting. Overall the movie did well with it's first time director and seeing Hemsworth get back into the uniform and Pena to be himself with his comical side that gave the audience a breath of fresh air in between tense scenes. The movie did pull of tension a lot better than most war movies especially ones that have come out in the past decade possibly and it's non-complicated story made it fun and interesting to allow the story to be driven mainly by the characters after the introduction.",12 Strong

151,Grumphy,Perhaps just not quite strong enough,6,18 January 2018,"12 StrongStory was ordinary. Nothing you haven't seen thousand times before. Pretty straightforward from the beginning till the end, but it worked. Dialogue was mostly sharp and clever, with a few missteps here and there. As it was yet another ""based on a true story"" there were moments, quite a few, that felt way overly glorified. Artificial even. But perhaps that was a necessary evil to create more meaning for characters. Which, speaking about the devil, brings me to the compulsory over the top villain, because bad guys have to be maxed out on all aspects of vile behaviour. Acting was solid for the most part. Great cast all around. Hemsworth pulls his weight and the team follows. At times even blindly, which is fine, because the enemy (because they're bad) shoot like stormtroopers. However, the next time I'd recommend taking more cover, and wearing a helmet couldn't hurt either. Perhaps they're too pretty and wanted to show it off?Which brings me to visuals. Action was engaging and tense, nothing bad to say about that. Some key explosions felt a little flat though. Camerawork was enjoyable. Nothing too fancy and therefore unnecessary. No crazy ""shaky cam"" during the chaotic battle scenes, but a mandatory shell-shock sequence, which seemed a tad too familar.The score and sound is decent. Both serving their purpose, but don't really go that extra mile. In a film such as this there probably isn't any need to. Unless one likes to challenge themselves to find out exactly how many guns are firing all at once during a scene or a take. If that's even possible. No memorable song to listen to when riding into a battle either. Well. It really wouldn't be much of a covert operation, crawling between the rocks, ""Valkyries"" blasting from the boom-box. Same goes for directing. It's a job done well. All in all. And despite some minor gripes, the film is enjoyable for the most part. But I cannot help but feel like it fell a tad short. It seemed a bit too clean and cut out. What was coloured in was kept exactly within the lines. I guess that's that ""based on"" aspect. Life itself is much more colourful, it doesn't care about borders. It's ragged, jagged and jaunty. Quite like the truth. And there are many true sides to any true story.",12 Strong

154,nadeeshantennage,Does justice in many flattering levels,7,13 May 2018,"'12 strong' is truly iconic in its own way of paying homage to the war heroes who are famously known as 'Horse soldiers'
The film also serves as a portrait for how a religion will be manipulated by evil willed people to justify the fake minded toxic manipulative realities.
The film is layered with good performances by its cast.
Navid Negahban who plays General Dostum manages to outshine the main lead Captain Nelson played by Chris Hemsworth particularly with an effortless investive performance.
The first quarter of the film might feel like a bit too slow paced where the war strategies are formulated but hang in there because the film would definitely serve as a good enough War film leading up to the climax with as many as shooting sequences that you would expect.
Apart from the fact that the flow of the plot takes too much time in the first half to show the viewers how the war strategies are laid out where it almost loses the consistent momentum I didn't come across any other place where the delivery of this heroic story fell flat.

182,gcastles-35417,Good actors let down by appalling dialogue,4,4 April 2018,"This is another one for the flag wavers. 12 Strong is the story of a Green Beret unit which helped Afghani warlords defeat Taliban and Al Qaeda forces to take a strategically important town in the very early days of the US-Afghanistan war.First time director Nicolai Fuglsig was a war correspondent in Kosovo, so his experiences no doubt lend some realism to the action scenes; of which there are plenty. However, his inexperience as a director, or perhaps the producers' desire for a return on the budget, reduce this film to a forgettable mash of bombs, bullets and fragile egos.
 
Michael Shannon is IMO one of the best character actors since Philip Seymour Hoffman. He has no opportunity to show his skill here, with some of the worst lines he will probably utter in his entire career being his standout moments in this film. Michael Pena reprises the role he's been playing repeatedly since the early 90s: a gung-ho soldier who loves his country. Trevante Rhodes gets lumped with all the most cringeworthy scenes. Navid Negahban provides us with the Pashto version of ""Hasta la vista, baby"". And Chris Hemsworth is Chris Hemsworth.This sums to a film where instead of being immersed in the action, we are frequently reminded we a re watching a film when dumb characters say dumb lines. If you are a fan of Thor et al, then you will probably find this film enthralling. If you have never seen a good war film, I would recommend watching Gettysburg or Das Boot instead; two films which didn't treat the audience like morons.",12 Strong

After watching this film, I have an even greater respect and admiration for our military and the sacrifices they make to secure the freedom and safety of this great nation. The actors did a phenomenal job portraying the real-life men who embarked on this mission, particularly Chris Hemsworth (I call him Captain Ameri-Thor, because in this film he plays a captain in the U.S. Army, and he also plays Thor). The action scenes were very intense, although they were a little confusing to watch at times because I couldn't always tell who were the good guys and who were the bad guys. Otherwise, it felt like I was right there on the battlefield with them. It's also worth noting that the scenes where the soldiers were on horseback were very cool to watch. It's amazing that the horses never tried to run away from the danger, but kept running towards it. I think those horses deserve extra carrots! In conclusion, I would definitely recommend this film if you want to see what real-life heroes look like and the lengths they'll go for our country.

The situations where they have to fight while riding the horsed they never rode before & the shots taken while riding the horse are the awesome ones . The brutal killings of women is a thing that is actually true and also that Taliban never allowed women to work so women in that country either begged or were dependent on their Husband, Brother, Father, & any women wandering without either one of them would be killed by Taliban OR STONED to death.

I am startled at the responses of some of the reviewers who are rejecting it on the basis of 'propaganda' or some other silly reason, it's also amusing that most of the reviews of that category are only of few lines which shows how difficult it is to criticize this well made movie.This is something which happened in real life, now of course a movie will dramatize the events for cenamatic purpose otherwise they could made another documentary like Restrepo once again but they are making a drama movie. Isn't it better to show our people the story of our real life heros like this movie has shown instead of eulogizing pseudo-Mytho creatures of Marvels? Respect the soldiers. Those who fought who shed their blood.The movie is entertaining, acting is brilliant and visual effects are by far great. So I will include it in a must watch list. It's not a perfect war film I agree but a story that needed to be told, on news this Afghan invasion (that was necessary to overthrow a sham regime like Taliban) sounded so easy but this film shows that it indeed took a lot of pain and loss to do that",12 Strong

Interesting story and in the hands of film makers behind Zero Dark Thirty could have been up there with the best war/action films.

As well - I was not aware of this first effort in the US response to September 11 and the quasi collaborative approach to an attempt on Al Qaeda. Nice to know. 
Otherwise the plot is just a handwritten-on-a-napkin approach to a logistically complicated effort without any depth - Action! - special Forces Identified, 9/11 happens, sad goodbye to family, insertion to country, three campaigns to deliver air support, bad guy identified by killing women, good guy suffers sucking chest wound, bad guy gets it, everyone makes it out alive, warm hello to family, actual group photo during credits - scene! 
One hopes that eventually the likes of Spielberg, Stone, Kubrick and Coppola will bring their warcraft to these middle eastern operations - ( though we do have Three Kings, Zero Dark Thirty and Restrepo ) but this was never WWII or vietnam - this was ""war during pokemon and Halo II"" - a better story than 12 strong has been told by Phil Klay's ""redeployment"" and in such tales I believe we will find the seminal storylines of the Bush era wars.",12 Strong

Both result in grossly unfair and misleading 1 or 2 star reviews.

I give it a 7 out of 10.The story/accuracy: This is based on a true story, so lets dispense with the problems with the premise. Horses navigate the mountainous terrain much better than APV's and tanks, though they are somewhat lacking in the firepower department. According to those who were there, there are some sequences out of order, some artistic license applied, and some factors omitted entirely. I've heard much worse complaints from the real-life participants in other films.Acting: Capable. Hemsworth did a good job, as did Michael Pena, Michael Shannon, et al. I thought the chemistry with the team as a whole was very good, and the banter and joking came across as genuine. Better than average ensemble.I'll skip the discussion on politics, except to say that I never felt that I was watching a recruiting film.

212,jaretricejhr,Far better than what most say it is...,4,21 January 2018,"""Depth"":
 This film was incredibly satisfying to me. It definitely had me on the edge of my seat when I was watching it. I really hate seeing these reviews that are complaining about the movie's depth, and I can see why you would consider that one of the film's flaws...but giving it a 5/10 or less because of that one flaw...really? If you think that there are more flaws than that then I would understand...but there's more to a film than it's ""depth"", especially a film based on a true story. I honestly thought this movie was very meaningful and thoughtful of the people that actually fought after the 9/11 terrorist attacks. It seems that critics aren't thinking about that at all, they just care about this one flaw in the film. You know that people don't look into a film as much as they need to when they give a film a pretty low rating because they noticed one flaw, especially one that a lot of people wouldn't notice, and or care about. My Thoughts On The Movie:
 This movie really showed me what the fights after the 9/11 terrorist attacks were like...and that's pretty much the movie's entire goal, is to educate it's viewers on what happened after 9/11. It was also a very heartwarming movie. Seeing all of the character's saying goodbye to their families was pretty sad to watch, but then you see characters like Mitch Nelson (played by Chris Hemsworth) smiling when they come back home seeing their families joyful reactions, you feel your heart sitting next to a fire (well...unless you care WAY too much about the films depth...). And that is what makes this a good ""War"" movie, that it's not just violence, it also explores the lives of the characters that are fighting in it. Seeing all of the main protagonists bond and joke with each other could also be really satisfying to people who don't like the ""overly-serious"" type films (I, however, am not one of those people). I just like how the writers put some humor into their script for this movie, and that's something you have to appreciate for films like this. If you're into these kinds of movies, I definitely suggest you watch it, and if you don't know, give it a watch, and if you're not, then you probably shouldn't watch it. Just focus on the movie's storyline and not on ENTIRELY on the depth, this movie has a lot of meaning to it and it's not aiming to become a perfect movie (not many films do), it just wants to educate it's viewers, which is what a lot of ""History"" films do, try to educate the viewer. I enjoyed it.Also, I was really satisfied about Michael Pena, Michael Shannon and Rob Riggle's roles in this flick.",12 Strong

The movie might/will be criticized by the classic anti-American, anti-West, anti-occupation, anti-war and many many other ideology followers. Though the movie has great story and great battle scenes these will be ignored by them. They will vote it down for their stupid reasons. They dont have the cumulative overall knowledge to understand the movie.The movie goes on to show whole of battlefield. We are not focused on close shot to heroes who shoot somewhere to the opposite direction of the camera where we cant see (though these type of scenes exist too, its a level that its supposed to be). As viewers we exactly know what is going on there, we are whether directly told or we get to know it by the cinematography. We are informed of the battle tactics and formations. It will feel great for those among you who like to grasp everything down to its each iota. Not to mention the effects of rocket launches, it gives a chill down the spine.It's very different from the rest of the movies about Afghanistan. Our American heroes/soldiers dont just go out there and save everyone and save the day. It dives down to understand the conflict and tries to get answers to questions such as ""why is there a civil war in Afghanistan, why people of Afghanistan arent doing anything against Taliban/Al-Qaeda, why do we support warlords, isnt Afghan a language, isnt Afghan an ethnicity"" etc.
The viewers are directly let known that there are many ethnicities and languages in Afghanistan. The leader of Northern Alliance is Abdulrashid Dostum and our team goes to meet him and fight alongside him and clear out as much territory as they can from the Taliban rule. We learn that Dostum is a public leader who is ethnically Uzbek and he speaks Uzbek, Dari, Pashto, Tajik and Russian, then we also figure out he speaks English well as well. We are even introduced to Uzbek language and way of life briefly. Then we understand that the actually the Uzbeks and other minorities suffered more under Taliban (including Dostum's own family) so the main ally US can find in Afghanistan immediately is the Turkic peoples such as Uzbeks and Turkmens. I highly recommend you to watch this for the great battle scenes and tactics that were used during America's campaigns, better understanding to history and to realize the ethnic dynamics of the region to some degree.",12 Strong

225,milleniumlogan,A sub-par war movie,6,24 January 2018,"Ever since I first heard about this movie almost a year ago, I have had high expectations for this movie. After all it's a war movie with Chris Hemsworth based on a true story. How could it go wrong? Right? ... Wrong.There are several things that war movies must have in order to be good and this movie failed in several categories. One facet of a war movie that absolutely must be present is realism. This is a category most war movies get right. This one did not. During the entire movie special forces troops blew away with their automatic weapons at Taliban bad guys and I only counted two times where a character reloaded. Now, I'm not going to complain if a movie like Fast and Furious is a little unrealistic with its reloading but in a movie like 12 Strong there needs to be frequent ammunition changes. Also, in the final battle Chris Hemsworth charges into the teeth of enemy tanks riding on horseback and somehow makes pin-point accuracy shots. The final battle scene felt very exaggerated and unrealistic. Now I realize that it is based on a ""true story"" but I guarantee that the movie touched up some things in an attempt to make a better movie. In a war movie, there needs to be a lot more gritty realism.A second thing that bothered me about the movie was that the bad guy was honestly lame. They pretty much slapped in one scene to make sure you know that he is a ruthless killer. There needed to be more development present.Finally, none of the action sequences were impressive or memorable and most of them centered around panning shots of B-52 bombing tanks which was pretty boring. I will never watch this again and I would not recommend it to anyone who is expecting a serious war movie.",12 Strong

227,klopy-35475,"Propaganda propaganda propaganda, etc propaganda!!! This's not true America lol",1,11 February 2021,"This is probably the worst war biopic I've ever seen, excluding thoroughly fictionalized ones such as Michael Bay's Pearl Harbor. In fact, I would hesitate to even call Bay's more recent war film, 13 Hours, a bad film as it at least had a compelling story and fully realized characters that I cared about in spite of it's many shortcomings.This film is cheesier than the average 80's action flick. Every line of dialogue feels like it came off a script, and not a very clever one at that. It feels like there are dozens of lines in the film from every major character that are delivered with the desperate intention to become quotes.The main character especially comes off as unreasonably brash. During the introduction, he immediately gives his superiors attitude following the September 11th attacks, and subsequently throws a tantrum, kicking over his desk to protest against his promotion, and immediately gets what he wants for being an impatient manchild, though the movie intended me to get the impression that this guy's valiant and brave. Despite no combat experience, he's confident that he and his team are coming back alive after kicking some terrorist asses, and they're gonna look dope doin' it.At no point did I feel any tension. Unlike just about every other film of the genre, the soldiers aren't shown as having fear despite lazily uttered lines claiming they do. Characters charge into battle constantly, like birds with their chests puffed up, to such a blatant degree that it's surprising that they weren't going to subvert this trope and found it simply acceptable. There's hardly any struggle for victory in this film, as it feels the good guys are chasing the baddies down like dogs and bombarding them from a distance with air strikes over and over. It's like 300, except with modern weaponry, and less tact, and no style. The American soldiers feel invincible, and they pretty much are as they survive several close-proximity explosions while baddies are turned to red mist, hoist by their own petards. There's no attempt made to surprise viewers, and oddly enough it tries its best to be comfortable and digestible. Though it can be argued that too many films nowadays are dark and gritty, there's a place for that tone, and war films are definitely the place to stick to that. The best war films are the ones that tend to delve deep into the horrors of war, but this film would rather be a positive idea rather than a though-provoking experience. It is easy to evoke strong sympathy for characters of a war film, especially when they're based on true events, but this film misses the mark entirely.The story isn't all that interesting to begin with. There's good intentions here, which are likely more apparent in the novel they skimmed through in making this adaptation, but ultimately it comes off as the less interesting spin-off in the events surrounding 9/11 and the war in the Middle East. United 93 has an incredible narrative, and it manages to make the most of its incredibly compelling story of real-world heroism while remaining respectful and realistic. 13 Hours, while very flawed, tells the politically controversial story of the Benghazi attacks on the 11th anniversary of 9/11. Zero Dark Thirty tells the story of assassinating Osama Bin Laden and is critically acclaimed. This film feels kind of like Pearl Harbor if that movie skipped the part where Pearl Harbor was attacked and instead focused on Hiroshima.The editing is sloppy at best. There are many instances of blood squibs that look very digital which cheapen the movie and make it look like a video game at parts. Numerous smoke, fire, and explosion effects also looked quite fake, and resolutions of objects seemed inconsistent. Sometimes objects and backgrounds looked blown up and low-detail or even skewed vertically in contrast to the foreground characters, leading me to believe they must have been chroma-keyed in, poorly. There are annoyingly useless and repetitive clips, such as the needless cuts to the Jafar-esque villain of the film giving menacing stares at our heroes, which add nothing to the plot or characters and just act as padding in an already paper-thin story for an extremely bloated movie.Also, this may be an error on my theater's part, but the audio was out of sync. Characters' lips were moving about a quarter of a second behind the actual audio, though it wouldn't be unlikely that something went wrong beyond the filmmaking itself, so I won't hold this against the film as of yet.The humor was cringeworthy at best. There's jokes and gags tossed in here and there which are thankfully not too frequent, but while they're intended for levity they come off as immature and inappropriate, especially given this movie's not depressing and thus doesn't require any levity. One character says he's hungry despite there being no word of this and nothing to hint to anyone in the crew being famished at this point, and he ends up buying a sheep off a local for $300, just to execute a punchline that this guy should be working for military commission, and instead of getting a scene with the crew eating a sheep and allowing for character interaction we skip to more boring military discussion followed by one of the longest action sequences I've ever seen in a movie.This movie lacks any passion and is simply a paint-by-numbers war flick with no more intention than cashing in on the lowest common denominators, and it will impress none other than the least demanding moviegoers.",12 Strong

It's too bad that it got average reviews because Thor was the main character in a ""based on true events"" film. He did fine and did not ruin it for me although some people would say that he is just being used to get the women in the theater cause yea dude is one good looking dude. However, his acting was solid and not over the top 'Heroic' despite is casted role trend. For someone that has had family actually fight in WWII, Korea, Vietnam, Iraq and Afghanistan; this is an amazing military story and makes me very proud. Well done 12 and thank you for your service. I am curious to know how close to accurate his movie depicted the real raw story. It's a Hollywood film guys, yes they have to make some changes, emphasis, and edits from the exact story.

I was mostly right, except for the atmosphere. They did one hell of a job to give this atmosphere. But scenario isn't good enough to keep grabbing your attention. It reached the climax too early and after that it got boring and boring especially the final battle scene is really long and you might just want to leave the theater. Visual, sound effects and Chris Hemsworth are really good. Even being based on a true story doesn't make it immersive or engaging, it makes it just one of tens of movies similar to each other.

239,skipknight,"Negative reviewers, do they understand what Green Berets actually do?",8,18 May 2018,"This was the 1st battle in Afghanistan after 9/11. Green Berets imbed with local militia to help them fight the enemy. That is what they did in Viet Nam. They are not a Infantry Battalion with massive numbers that fights on its own. At the end of the movie one character points out that the won the battle but the war was not over.
The Green Berets were able to call in air strikes against the Taliban to take out large numbers of the enemy. They were able to supply the ""Northern Coalition"" with much needed supplies through air drops. They caught the Taliban by surprise. 
The movie noted that there were at least three Northern Forces that would just as soon fight each other as fight the Taliban. That was not a factor during this operation but did become one later. The area is very Tribal, and trying to get the various tribes to work together is extremely difficult.
In one battle scene the Afghan general waits until he can confirm his nephew has left the village. The Green Berets are told that people frequently switch sides there, which is another problem they face.
The United States is partly responsible for the Taliban. When Russia invaded Afghanistan they were fighting with WW1 weapons. We, the CIA, supplied them with modern weapons, AK47s and RPGs, and taught them how to use them against Russian helicopters. We even supplied then with shoulder launched surface to air missiles to shoot down Soviet planes and jets. 
The Afghan General tells the Captain if he leaves he is a coward but if he stays he will become the enemy. Once again the US is in a country where we do not fully understand the culture, the politics, the people. We expect they will just immediately convert to OUR way of doing things. Our country is 300 years old. Their country is over 2000 years old.
The 12 man Green Beret team was able to get in, work with one of the local militias to strike a quick, damaging blow to the Taliban. It was a knock down blow, not a knock out. The Taliban was able to regroup. 
The movie did a great job telling the story of how these SF soldiers were quick to respond after 9/11, work with a group of people who did not trust them and who could have killed them at any time, in some of the most brutal terrain in the world, and carried out a mission in just over 3 weeks that some thought would take 2 years.",12 Strong

Having conducted some research into the accuracy of the movie afterwards it turns out the basic theme of it is quite accurate; it's based on the book Horse Soldiers. It is screened very much from the view point of the Americans being so much better than everyone else but the action scenes are quite good and I always like a film based on a true story.

So yea, the soldiers are going to look like they're immortal/invincible. But that's because they all survived.It's a simple story. Team had a mission and executed. What else did you expect from a war biopic??Now if you call this American propaganda, then maybe you just don't like the truth. Yes, it is an unbelievable feat. But it really happened.

The lack of character development is the main reason I didn't enjoy the movie. I have a ton of respect for the real life heroes of this story and all the men and women serving in uniform, but I feel like they could've been honored better on-screen if we knew more about them. Apart from that: the action was good, but I don't believe good action alone makes a movie good. Something else has to be done to get you to think harder or feel more emotionally connected. I've seen a lot of great war movies, but 12 Strong lacks the aspects that make certain war movies so good.Conclusion: I would honestly recommend reading a book about this event or do some research online about it.

This story should have been put in better hands than it was and Jerry Bruckheimer should be near shame honestly.The writing is fairly spot on in squad/platoon/team banter and dynamics, but character development, or even background, is basically non-existent. The rest feels bland and uninspired, which given there is an actual book for source material seems a bit lazy, if not downright disrespectful. The acting is average to above average in spots. And you can certainly tell most of them were never given actual training on operator movements, weapon systems, mannerisms, etc. Bad guys die in exactly the same poses and animations multiple times over. Good guys seem to fire indiscriminately. And no one EVER reloads their damn weapon. Except one time an hour and forty five minutes in. Effects and cinematography both range from great to complete B-movie levels. And the editing is garbage. Inconsistent shot to shot makeup, adding/subtracting sounds where unnecessary, time dilation errors.. you name it and an editing sin was committed.Like I said, the details.This movie with someone like Peter Berg, or god forbid Michael Bay (13 Hours), at the helm would have been far higher on the pegs of critique.

Thousands of Prisoners and detainees were packed in shipping containers on route to Shibarghan. A single container held up to 250 prisoners. Most died from asphyxiation.

338,bobby_gange,"Bland, formulaic and devoid of any soul.",3,5 September 2021,"""You don't have killer eyes.""This movie, just like the quote by the Afghan warlord (Navid Negabahn) to Chris Hemsworth's unblooded American Army captain (wait... isn't that Thor, not Captain America?), is cliched and laboured. In trying so hard to be taken seriously, it only serves to alienate its intended audience and harbour resentment at its arrogant posturing.While the acting was not terrible, the material with which they had to work was pedestrian at best, nonsensical at its worst.Any attempt to humanise the protagonists of the story stops short of providing the viewer with a reason to care about any of them, and presents only a cardboard cutout figure - like the ones you associate with a military training facility where trainees are supposed to shoot the ones who look like bad guys but not hurt any of the ones that are just there minding their business. I wanted to like Hemsworth's young, family-driven, but bristling to be the first to strike back at an enemy who attacked his country squad captain. However, his motivations never went further than wanting to prove he was up to the task of retaliating against the Taliban who were working with Al Qaeda. Even the usually likeable Michael Peña was a wasted character, and Michael Shannon's taciturn Warrant Officer Hal Spencer was a caricature of a grizzled experienced soldier but came out of retirement (or at least delayed his retirement plans by dramatically tearing up the papers in front of his CO) so he could guide the young pup to become a wolf. Even Negabahn's General Dostum, who was actually given a believable reason to want to take back the village he once ruled from rival Mullah Razan (played masterfully by Numan Acar), once he had achieved his goal of liberating his home, decided he didn't really want to go in anymore.The movie had all the ingredients of a good story. Unfortunately, the producers opted to go for the expensive pre-packaged kits and somehow stuffed up the cooking instructions. What you're left with is a meal that looks good on Instagram but you end up throwing most of it in the garbage after a couple of bites.",12 Strong

It's perfectly reasoable to give low ratings to any movie based on reasoned criticism, but when people call Casablanca or Lawrence of Arabia, ""The worst movie of all time"", they lose all credibility. Even if you hate some critically acclaimed movie, it's ridiculous hyperbole to call it the worst movie. After watching 12 Strong ... maybe I was wrong.It's hard to believe that a modern, big budget action movie could be this bad. I'll leave it to knowledgeable military people to point out the almost silly portrayals of battle. The, oh so obvious ambushes that they would walk into, but somehow be victorious anyway.The dialogue is non-stop ""action movie"" cliché banter that never rises above adolescent humor. Like others have said, only simplistic portrayals of Americans as super cool, handsome, sharp shooters, filled with buckets of over confidence, bravery, and witty repartee. While Afghans are reluctant fighters who switch allegiance constantly, concerned only with self-preservation. Also, they are sneaky and can't be trusted.Oh, and just for good measure, civilians in the Defense Dept. don't know anything about real combat and make absurd comments.

356,nicovihpeltier,The *killer eyes* of the Horse Soldiers,7,18 February 2018,"In 12 Strong you follow the journey of 12 US soldiers, mostly their captain named Mitch Nelson (Hemsworth). A man who has never been to war, however that doesn't stop him to go headstrong to the battlefield. His men follow him with no hesitation, and they are good at firing a couple of jokes at times, considering where they are and what they are doing. This makes the movie nicer, as you can see how humor help loosening the mood up a bit.
Nelson has to work together with the Afghan General Dostum (Negahban), who isn't very good at cooperating. However one thing is sure, Dostum wants to take down the Taliban and he needs the help of the US army, as he doesn't have enough firearms on his own.The movie has a nice pace to it, as it starts out showing us the different soldiers, their reaction to the 9/11 attack, but also their wifes/families, who all have a different way to send off their men. When they get to Afghanistan it's Nelsons' job to convince his superiors that his team is ready to be sent out there. Luckily Nelson is an intelligent man who knows how to speak his mind and case.
Nelsons' first meeting with Dostum isn't the best, and because Nelson doesn't have those *Killer eyes*, as Dostum so nicely puts it, the trust takes a long time to build.
At the same that all of this is happening you get small glimpses of some of the things that the Taliban is doing, shown in the scenes with Razzan (Acar), someone who seems like the leader of one of the Taliban groups, and one with whom Dostum has a big grudge against.12 Strong is one of Fuglsig first movies, and he has done a good job. The images are very beautiful at times, and the explosions are quite realistic. I really like the casting too - and not just because of Hemsworth, even though he does make up most of the film - and characters such as Diller (Peña) the comedic one, and Spencer (Shannon) Nelsons' right-hand man are very important to the building of the story and characters, but also to lighten the mood.All in all I really liked this movie, and it's crazy to think that it's taking from a real story. Quite impressing.",12 Strong

However I am really weary of seeing Captain America type of movies where only the Americans know how to shoot, kill, jump, ride and have emotions. Did I fail to mention are invincible as well.

365,jaffolicious,B for effort - read the book!!!,7,9 August 2018,"The book and story upon which this Hollywood flock is based is awesome, and even important. The movie is a fairly standard Hollywood-version military exercise, and I can't fully fault the production team or actors because they have to tell a big story in 2 hours about a major event that should be well known to Americans and Afghans alike, let alone the rest of the world. Plus, no one behind the special effects or acting or script or direction were there. Much like Lone Survivor it's a pretty decent depiction of a true story for a film production, but also much like Lone Survivor, I wish it had taken the source material a tad more seriously, and attached much more telling and brutal realism (like Saving Private Ryan and The Hurt Locker) in terms of mood and dialog and acting, and even equipment and battle scenes. I don't want a Tears Of The Sun fairy tale with my war movies. I want something that transports us there. More realistic tactics, weapons that fire and report realistically, bombs that aren't full of fireballs all the time, etc... All could have been done here. But many would have lost interest in the drama... It's been dumbed down, and 90% of the audience will have no idea. Maybe I demand too much, or am too picky, or just don't accept the ""average"" like ""average"" Americans who don't look any deeper at stuff like war other than action films and headlines. I feel like our veterans deserve better. Meanwhile, the negative reviews here are by folks who really have no idea what they're talking about, especially when they call it ""propaganda"". Politics produce propaganda. This is a story based on actual accounts...as in: it happened. Doesn't matter what your politics are. Read the book Horse Soldiers. Talk to more vets. Talk to some Afghani people who know a bit about their own country and the Taliban. This movie could have been WAY better, but it was sinply ""good"" as what we've come to expect from Hollywood most of the time. I think it was wasted on misguided and detached production values and sensationalism that can only be provided by limited knowledge and devotion. Had Spielberg made this flick? Might have been an all-time great. And I say MIGHT, because it would be almost impossible to bring the reality and education to the screen that the book was able to portray and provide, and the reality on the ground these men experienced. Why we settle for pop culture education on important matters and historical events as our ONLY education is beyond me. But it seems the American audience wouldn't know the difference if REALITY ran over them in the form of a stampede of horses with a team of US special forces and Afghan militia on their backs. So I guess there's no real hard done, right?",12 Strong

They were given a mission and carried it out in some of the most difficult conditions imaginable. After 9/11 these soldiers were doing their part to try and prevent future terrorist actions. We should all be proud that we have people like this who risk their lives for all American citizens. I was deeply moved by this movie.,12 Strong
370,fschwander,American propaganda...,1,8 May 2020,...this movie makes me sad. But on the positive side: it illustrates perfectly how ignorant Americans can be when it comes to understanding the world from a global view (and not just a brainwashed YAY MERICA one).,12 Strong

372,WowTex,Amazing movie!,10,1 February 2018,"I usually do not go to these types of movies, nor leave reviews for them. But I must say this is an amazing movie for it's genre. It does not go with the usual stereotypes of ""bad muslims"". It is a movie for all Americans regardless of who they are if they want to know why we are still in the middle east. The actors were great, battle scenes on point. If you are still sketchy about seeing this movie like I was at first, well, don't be. Go see it cause it is worth it.",12 Strong
373,bethreed,Great Movie & great acting,10,1 June 2019,Don't understand the negativity as it is a retelling of events in detail we don't get in the news. Reiterated what our soldiers go through and I'm grateful they have such courage-,12 Strong

The greatest hero is my general friend, and they need to show it as 13 heroes, put it in the picture and clarify the unity. There was a Mustafa Kemal in these 2 heroes. What do you need the body of Mustafa Kemal. Those who believe in oneself can see Atatürk as well as Hz.Muhammed with these 2 souls without criticizing them. General friend: That's the difference
between you and me.You have many men over you.Over me, only God. American soldier: God, that was some
real bonding right there. Micheal: Yeah. Do not forget this message. good watch",12 Strong
379,andre_sa-20430,American War Propaganda,1,8 April 2018,"Well, I think that's about it... glorifying war in a stupid way. Should it at least be entertaining there would be something going for it. However all that's left is a propaganda like movie that has no interest for non-USAers, and for USAers I'd suspect anyone with some intelligence would see through. Or join the military. I don't know.",12 Strong

383,areday,Better than I thought.,8,12 March 2018,"As a person who didn't know the background to the events of the 12 soldiers after 9/11 I really enjoyed the film. The story was typically set up with the film showing the soldiers family lives and the difficult situation of leaving to serve their country and it flowed on from there. I felt there wasn't the typical Hollywood style soldier being portrayed here, which was a good thing. The one aspect of the film that stood out for me were the battle scenes which were really well staged. One small criticism was the Taliban and their role in the movie, I wanted to see more of a backstory to show how brutal they actually are. The character development was pretty good and the dialogue wasn't that of a Tarantino or McDonagh film, there wasn't a lot the actors could delve into to show how good they are, especially Michael Shannon who I really enjoy seeing. All in all a pretty good way of spending 2 hours of your time.",12 Strong
384,brandonglade,Hell Yeah!,9,21 January 2018,"As a former member of the military, I can honestly say that I thoroughly enjoyed this movie, and the fact that 75% of the audience was applauding at the end, made me fell pretty proud to have served this great Country! I don't know how accurate the actual story was told, but at the end of the day, 12 brave men, put themselves in harms way and accomplished an extremely dangerous mission. I felt the cast was excellent, and battle scenes realistic.
Go see this movie, I'm glad that stories like this get told!",12 Strong

387,johnjohnson-40066,Reality,10,12 April 2018,It is refreshing to get a movie in this day and age that is Pro West and shows the brutal reality of Islamic terror tribes like Al Qaeda and ISIS. Something Hollywood is terrified of doing these days.,12 Strong

390,vidakruger,Look! It's a first review :p,6,21 April 2018,"Yeah, yeah. I know. Suspicious. First review. Not a bad movie, despite the many whining little sub average reviews. Yup, contains some usual America saves the world propaganda. *Shock horror* Made by Americans! However, despite slow start with the background to make you like most of the teams and letting you see the growth, they do get to the gung ho action. And the ""based on"" bit allows for a bit of leeway of seeing people interact vs ""See bad guy, shoot bad guy"" stuff.Pour yourself a glass of wine, sit back and go on an adventure. Without the bad side effects. Like getting killed.",12 Strong
391,jhorrace,Casting comedy actors for war movie,1,5 May 2018,"Where to start.. Comedy actors trying to make war films..
Actors are not believable as human beings.
Everyone is just spraying bullets without target acquisition 
1990's almost Red Dawn quality effects
Cheesy one liners
""please let it be over"" I would like the time back.. somehow",12 Strong
392,mark_a_dorner,Good war movie with authentic weapons,7,6 May 2018,I don't understand all the negative and one liner reviews- most be trolls. The absurdity of mounted cavalry attack against a T-72 speaks volume of OEF. A few errors such as glowing NVGs and a tad weak Mk82 bombs.,12 Strong
393,contact-78521,"Decent entertaining movie, but propaganda",6,3 August 2018,"If you leave aside politics, this movie is quite decent, entertaining and deserves the rating it currently has (6.6 out of 10.)However, if you keep in mind the political context (""war"" against terrorism, need to justify 2300+ deaths of american soldiers, 20k+ wounded soldiers, 2.1 trillions USD spent on this war, racism that is increasing in the US, the need to ""make America great again"", the need to recruit soldiers, and difficulties to do it) you must admit that the way this movie narrates this part of history is pure propaganda. Don't be fooled, this movie is an excellent example of how entertainment can be used to brainwash the population of a country. US people need strong and invincible heroes and need to see their soldiers come back from hell unharmed. This will allow the army to recruit new soldiers, justify past, current political decisions and futures ones.If you don't agree with this opinion, fine. But then tell me why they choose to have a black actor and a hispanic one to play ODA 595 soldiers. At the end of the movie there is a picture of the 12 soldiers, and guess what, they are all white guys.Manipulating history in such a way is disgusting IMHO. You should be aware of this while watching this movie.",12 Strong
