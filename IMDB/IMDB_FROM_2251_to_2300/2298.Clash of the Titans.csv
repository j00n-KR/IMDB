0,MartinHafer,fun to watch but may cause Classical Studies professors to have a stroke,6,16 March 2006,"BEWARE--do NOT let Classical Studies professors or anyone obsessed with Greek Mythology watch this film! They will either have a stroke or spend the entire movie complaining how almost NONE of the plot is really taken from classical mythology but is a lot of hooey. Plus, it's got some really dopey moments (such as the mechanical owl--what a dreary character). BUT, if you don't care that it isn't really based on real myths and just turn off your brain, it's actually pretty good. In fact of all the Ray Harryhausen-created special effect movies about the Greeks, it's probably the best (though his all-time best film has got to be EARTH VS. THE FLYING SAUCERS). Watch it and enjoy the action. Just don't try to think too much--it will probably make your head hurt!",Clash of the Titans
1,TheLittleSongbird,Just another example of good nostalgic fun!,7,30 May 2010,"I loved this film as a kid, watching it again it isn't as good as I remembered it but it is very entertaining.Admittedly the story structure is very story-book like, and some of the acting is not that great, Laurence Olivier looks the part but overacts and while Harry Hamlin looks all heroic as Perseus, his more ""touching"" scenes with Judi Bowker are somewhat anaemic. And the script is not the best either, it has its moments but some of it is cheesy. But there is still plenty to enjoy.First and foremost, the stop-motion special effects are absolutely incredible! Ray Harryhausen creates some truly memorable monsters especially, to this day I am still absolutely terrified of the Gorgon Medussa and the Kraken is also amazing to look at. The scenery, architecture, cinematography and costumes are also fabulous, and the music is superb. The pacing is fine and the direction is efficient. Claire Bloom, Ursula Andress and Maggie Smith give welcome support among the star-studded cast too.Overall, this is just an entertaining nostalgic ride, flawed yes, terrible, no. 7/10 Bethany Cox",Clash of the Titans
2,bkoganbing,Olympic Perspective,7,17 June 2007,"Seeing Clash of the Titans took me back to my youth and seeing such Ray Harryhausen films like Seventh Voyage of Sinbad and Jack the Giant Killer. The only difference here is instead of Kerwin Matthews and Torin Thatcher, we've got a cast list headed by none other than Laurence Olivier.This was the period in Lord Olivier's life where he was just looking for bankable projects to leave a nice nest egg for the kids. He was one guy who really didn't have to prove anything as an artist. And I'm sure it amused him no end to be cast as Zeus, king of all the Deities.Seeing Olivier trading lines with such folks as Maggie Smith and Ursula Andress and Claire Bloom in the realms of Olympus reminds me a lot of the Irwin Allen film, The Story of Mankind. It was a bad flop, but the scenes in which Cedric Hardwicke, Vincent Price, and Ronald Colman argued about man being good or evil are classic. With such intervention and such traps as the Olympus crowd puts on earth. young Perseus, son of Zeus and a mortal like Hercules, fulfills his destiny and of course saves the princess Andromeda. Harry Hamlin and Judi Bowker made an attractive pair of young lovers. Certainly Harry Hamlin has gone on to a substantial career.Burgess Meredith has a very nice role as companion/mentor to Hamlin, almost the same as the Mentor role in and to Captain Marvel. You've got to love that mechanical owl who speaks in bleeps that only Hamlin can understand. Clash of the Titans also was the farewell performance of Flora Robson who played one of the Stygian witches.And like the dragons and cyclops and huge flying birds that Ray Harryhausen created in my youth, his version of a Kraken is a worthy addition to his gallery of monsters. Might even be better than the Kraken of Pirates of the Caribbean and without computer graphics to do it.Clash of the Titans is aimed for the juvenile trade. But if it sparks an interest in the classics than the film will be worth the admission.",Clash of the Titans
3,Leofwine_draca,Harryhausen's swansong and a childhood favourite,9,17 February 2016,"Sadly, this was the last movie for stop-motion man Ray Harryhausen, and therefore the last real fantasy epic made in Britain (whoever said KRULL, I said ""real""!). While not as visually impressive as JASON AND THE ARGONAUTS - and let's face it, how could it be? This being an '80s film compared to a '60s film after all - CLASH OF THE TITANS certainly has moments where it recaptures some of the magic of Harryhausen's golden years and these alone make the film worth watching. Relying heavily on Greek mythology as a basis, CLASH OF THE TITANS is set aside from other muscleman entries by having a number of scenes set in the supposed palace of the Gods, who spend most of their time bickering and arguing like little children.Laurence Olivier is Zeus. No, he IS Zeus. I've heard some people complain about his performance but I can't imagine anyone else being as stern and authoritative in the role. Basically, it seems like it was written for him, and Olivier is great. Let's say no more about it. Zeus' companions are played by Maggie Smith (great at being ""evil""), Claire Bloom and an almost unnoticeable Ursula Andress, a Goddess of Standing Around in the Background and Looking Beautiful. These scenes serve to give the movie a heavyweight backbone and act as a basis for the plot, which is basically a string of action scenes where Perseus and his companions battle whatever twisted creation comes next from the genius mind of Ray Harryhausen.I'm not sure of the budget with this film, but I'm guessing it was quite high with most of the cash being eaten away by the wealth of stars appearing. However, the photography is colourful and great to look at, the film is well made throughout and the various historical landscapes - generally swathed in atmospheric mist and fog - are all excellent, most being filmed in the Mediterranean to give an extra oomph. The only thing really lacking is a noticeable score along the lines of Bernard Herrmann, but I can forgive that.Harry Hamlin is cast as Perseus, the toned hero. It always amuses me how the Italians always had bodybuilders as their mythical heroes while us British made do with athletic but generally skinny guys along the lines of Kerwin Matthews and John Philip Law. Hamlin is probably one of the most wooden heroes in a film of this variety, and almost totally lacking in charisma too. Thankfully the producers recognised this flaw and so give him little emoting to do, instead just run around a lot and look pretty. Andromeda is played by Judi Bowker, a ravishing beauty who looks a lot like Linda Hayden, which is no bad thing.Also cast as a sidekick is the inimitable Burgess Meredith, who is still quite good even though he really doesn't have anything to do. Also appearing are the likes of Flora Robson and Freda Jackson as disturbing Stygian witches, extremely clichéd creations (and blind too) but still masterpieces of the grotesque. Being a post-Star Wars movie aimed at kids, they had to throw in a mechanical creation a la R2-D2, so we have to put up with an annoying tin owl which makes lots of stupid noises throughout the movie and seems more a home in a science fiction epic than a supposed fantasy. I remember thinking that the owl was really cute as a kid but it just grates now as an adult.Once again, Harryhausen's excellent stop-motion creations dominate the film and here are some of his finest models in his entire filmography. The best of the lot has to be the Medusa, a ferocious-looking creature who through the use of shadow actually manages to look quite terrifying, and certainly scared me LOADS as a kid. It certainly beats the Italian variant in MEDUSA VS THE SON OF HERCULES, what a load of rubbish that was in comparison! After Hamlin cuts off the monster's head (a great-looking prop too), we get to witness oozing blood from the neck wound, an image ingrained in my memory since childhood and still pretty disgusting to this day.Like the Baboon in SINBAD AND THE EYE OF THE TIGER, there is also a ""good"" creature here, which this time is the Pegasus, again a well-animated beast which is slightly overused. Also appearing are a giant vulture (good), a horned troll-creature (very good, and almost devilish in look), a trio of nasty scorpions, a two-headed dog (very realistic this one) and to top it all, a gigantic Kraken which threatens to give the colossal statue in JASON AND THE ARGONAUTS a run for its money. Other non-Harryhausen but fun effects include skeleton boatman Charon rowing across the River Styx (creepy, and a perfect representation of the Grim Reaper) and the destruction of Argos, complete with tidal waves and falling masonry - simply stupendous! Being the '80s, the audience demand for graphic violence was at a high, so we get to see the various creatures bleed a lot too as they are hacked to death by our heroes and there's a lot of general violence to enjoy. In all, CLASH OF THE TITANS was great fun as a kid and is still pretty enjoyable today, and even if it pales in comparison to Harryhausen's earlier work it's still a fitting finale for the master of stop-motion.",Clash of the Titans
4,SnoopyStyle,the end of an era,7,6 September 2014,"King Acrisius of Argos sends his daughter and her son Perseus off in a wooden coffin. An angry Zeus (Laurence Olivier) releases the Kraken to destroy Argos. Perseus is saved and grows up in safety. Calibos is the son of sea goddess Thetis (Maggie Smith) engaged to Princess Andromeda (Judi Bowker). However Calibos hunted Zeus's sacred flying horses and he is transformed into a monstrous satyr. In revenge, Thetis leaves Perseus (Harry Hamlin) to chance abandoned in Joppa while cursing Andromeda. Perseus is aided by an old poet named Ammon (Burgess Meredith). Zeus sends Perseus a helmet of invisibility from Athena (Susan Fleetwood), a sword from Aphrodite (Ursula Andress), and a shield from Hera (Claire Bloom). He captures Pegasus and answers the riddle of Andromeda breaking her curse. However Thetis is insulted at the wedding and commands that Andromeda be sacrificed to the Kraken.It is the end of Ray Harryhausen's era as stop motion photography fades in light of the new computer technology. It is the last and finest example of his work. This has great old fashion actors doing their best to give this movie substance. The story is a little bit complicated but the expositions do a good job. The movie just works. It's high adventure on a grand scale like old Hollywood.",Clash of the Titans
5,Hitchcoc,"Pretty Good, All Things Considered",8,13 May 1999,"It's always difficult to review something in 1999 which was made 18 years earlier. The first thing that people do is to criticize the special effects. Does this mean that every movie made before computer graphics should be rejected out of hand. Should we start by throwing out The Wizard of Oz because the flying monkeys used piano wires? It ultimately gets down to whether there is a story worth telling and how well that story is told. Clash of the Titans is not a masterpiece. It does, however, tell a pretty good story. The characters are interesting and the thread of mythology is interesting enough to carry it to its conclusion. The special effects are the stop action kind that were the only thing available at this time. Believe me, they were a lot of fun when the movie first came out.This tells the story of Perseus who is not as well known in mythology as say Hercules, Theseus, or Jason, but his story is a fun one. The quest for the evil Medusa, the need to figure out a way to defeat her without being turned to stone, the evil Calibos (a complete creation), and, of course, the beautiful Andromenda (Judi Bowker, who is absolutely stunning) is the prize. It is paced nicely and the scenery is pretty breathtaking. The music is also very nice. I enjoyed the creatures. I liked the boatman and the river of death. I liked Pegasus, I liked the sound effects. But I don't mind suspending my disbelief.The downsides are numerous but I think they have more to do with what the director chose to do. The gods and goddesses are stiff and uninteresting, including Laurence (anything for a buck) Olivier. Some pretty important actors to throw away at these Olympian debriefings. They could have lost the owl. He is a mini version of R2-D2 with his silly metallic bleeps and erratic actions. I'm sure they did this for the kids but it really diminished the integrity of the story. Still, if you allow yourself, you can have a lot of fun with this film.",Clash of the Titans
6,mark.waltz,A large case of Gorgon-Zola makes for Cheezie fun!,8,6 February 2014,"For the last of his classic adventure sword and sandal films, Ray Harryhausen rounded up a cast of British and American film legends and turned what could have been a campy fiasco into a mesmerizing epic of Greek mythology. Yes, there are some falsehoods in translating the story of Perseus from Greek legend to Hollywood fiction, but oh, what a fun ride it is. Perseus (Harry Hamlin) is the grandson of a Greek Island king who angers Zeus by sending his daughter (who had the child out of wedlock with none other than the head of Mt. Olympus himself) out to sea in a huge crate with the infant future hero. Zeus takes his revenge, sending Poseidon to destroy the kingdom and years later, Perseus gets involved in the legend of the revenge of Zeus's sister on another kingdom whose princess (Judi Bowker) rejected the hand of her own son when Zeus turned him into a horribly deformed creature. Perseus steps up to the plate to win the princess for himself, taking on his evil cousin, giant scorpions, two-headed wolves and even the deadliest of Gorgons, Medusa herself.Opening with a fabulously epic score by Laurence Rosenthal, ""Clash of the Titans"" is mesmerizing from start to finish, and oh, what a cast. Handsome Harry Hamlin moved into leading man territory (before going ""straight"" into ""Making Love"") as the heroic Perseus and he does wonders with the part, being much more than just a pretty face and glorious body clad in nothing but a toga. Bowker is lovely and fragile without being cloying, and they are surrounded by a glorious cast of veterans in both Earthling and Greek God roles. Sir Laurence Olivier is totally grand as Zeus; Who else could have played this part (thank goodness Charlton Heston wasn't available!) without making it a huge ego fest? He commands every moment he is on screen, and it is without a doubt one of the crowning achievements of his later career. As his wife, Claire Bloom has little to do, but she does get in a few good lines. At least she isn't totally wasted as Ursula Andress is as Aphrodite. The curio for me is the opportunity to see Maggie Smith (as the Goddess Thetis) going up against Sian Phillips (""I Claudius's"" evil Livia). To see Phillips, whose character in the BBC mini-series set out to kill off everybody she could who stood in the way of her dreams to get her son on the throne of Rome going up against the glorious future Dame Maggie is a film lover's dream, and to watch Maggie literally loose her head as she tells off the vain Queen Cassiopea (Phillips) is a moment in film history that I cherished upon my first viewing and have memorized for my own moments of privately camping it up. Both women share that glorious voice that made them scene-stealers in everything they do, and to see these two legends working together (even if Smith in her scene with Phillips literally is a head of concrete) is glorious.Burgess Meredith totally hams it up as Hamlin's aged sidekick, making you both smile and roll your eyes at him at the same time. Veteran actress Flora Robson (who ironically played Livia in the ill-fated and uncompleted ""I Claudius"") is barely recognizable as one of the three witches Perseus faces during his quest to find the method of destroying the threatened danger on Bowker. However, when she does briefly get to speak, you recognize the voice who once cried over her ""wild, sweet Cathy"" in ""Wuthering Heights"". Fans quibble about the silly looking metal owl sent to protect Perseus, but the flying scenes with the magical horse Pegasus are certainly magical to behold. So if there are a few weaknesses in the film, they are more than made up for by the gems in the casting and most of the special effects which compared to the headache inducing remake are wonderful.",Clash of the Titans
7,claudio_carvalho,A Wonderful Fantasy,10,21 January 2004,"In the Mount Olympus, Zeus (Laurence Olivier) destroyed the city Argus with the Titan Kraken to punish King Acrisius (Donald Houston) that sentenced his daughter Danae (Vida Taylor) and her son with Zeus Perseus to death in the sea. Zeus orders Poseidon to save them and Perseus grows up in a paradisiacal island with his mother. Years later, Zeus punishes Calibos (Neil McCarthy), the evil son of the goddess Thetis (Maggie Smith) and fiancé of Princess Andromeda (Judi Bowker), turning him into a monster doomed to live in the swamps. The vindictive Thetis curses Andromeda with a spell and every suitor should solve a riddle; otherwise he would be sentenced to the bonfire. Further, she brings Perseus (Harry Hamlin) while sleeping half-naked to the City of Jopa but Zeus gives magical helmet, shield and sword to his son for self-protection. When Perseus sees Andromeda, he falls in love with her and uses the magic outfits and Pegasus to discover the answer of the riddle with Calibos. But Thetis dooms Andromeda to be sacrificed to the Kraken otherwise the City of Jopa and the inhabitants will be destroyed by the Titan. Perseus now has to defeat Medusa and the Kraken to save his beloved princess.The saga of Perseus, the mortal son of Zeus, and the intrigue among the Gods of Olympus, is brilliant presented in this magnificent film. The delightful story is supported by an outstanding international cast, with names such as Laurence Olivier, Burgess Meredith, Maggie Smith and Ursula Andress, and by fantastic special effects, considering this is a 1981 movie. The golden mechanical owl Buba is hilarious and responsible for some of the best moments in this film. This epic is a wonderful and highly recommended entertainment for the whole family. I do not recall how many times I have had the pleasure of watching this film. Yesterday I saw on DVD for the first time, and there is a pleasant interview with the producer in the extras. For me, this movie is a classic in the genre. My vote is ten.Title (Brazil): ""Fúria de Titãs"" (""Fury of Titans"").Note: On 01 August 2010 I saw this movie again.",Clash of the Titans
8,kosmasp,The original - stick with it,9,1 June 2020,"So yes the remake may have had a bigger budget and gone with CGI (you judge if it fares better), but I'd urge you to stick with this. This is the original and Harryhausen is the man, when it comes to effects (stop motion and others). Now there are cliches and I understand if some may feel this is somehow dated ... but than you let your inner kid chained. Let it free, let it enjoy this.Also the Owl! How could the Remake snub the Owl!?! One of the funnest things here, even if it was an obvious stab or rather nod to Star Wars and R2-D2. Still this is a fun thing to have and a very useful one. So maybe the mythology is not entirely rooted in ""facts"" or what I've learned about Greek mythology at least, but creative freedom is ok in that regard in my book. Nice story and well told",Clash of the Titans
9,gavin6942,The Definitive Harryhausen?,7,9 October 2017,"Perseus must battle both Medusa and the Kraken to save the Princess Andromeda.Anyone who loves fantasy or classic genre film knows Ray Harryhausen and loves his work. Never will you ever hear, ""That Harryhausen! What a rube!"" And this film, more than any other, is probably the definitive showcase of his work -- from Pegasus to the owl to Medusa to the kraken... it is just so many iconic figures in one film.And what a film! Certainly epic in scope, it is possibly the best Greek myth captured on film. I mean, really, what even comes close? Those endless cruddy Hercules movies? Nope ""Jason and the Argonauts""? Maybe, but still nope. If there is ONE must-see, this is it.",Clash of the Titans
10,lee_eisenberg,clash of mythologies,4,19 March 2006,"""Clash of the Titans"" is the sort of movie that could have ended up really neat, given what they had with which to work. Unfortunately, almost every part of it is screwed up in some way or another. First of all, the people in the movie all act as though they're on depressants; it's more like an Ed Wood movie in that respect. Moreover, the plot doesn't exactly resemble Greek mythology. The Kraken is Scandinavian, I think that the owl is from ""Return to Oz"", and the three witches are obviously yanked out of ""Macbeth"". How tragic that a hot babe like Ursula Andress - so illustrious in ""Dr. No"" - got reduced to this. On that subject, how did they get so many great people in this swill? Laurence Olivier, Maggie Smith, Burgess Meredith all did much better than this throughout their lives (I don't really know anything about Harry Hamlin).So, to paraphrase the title of a Denzel Washington movie, don't remember this ""Titans"".",Clash of the Titans
11,jboothmillard,Clash of the Titans,5,11 July 2005,"I remember watching this film a few times when I was younger, but as I grew up, I could only remember the most obvious parts, so I'm glad when I watched it again as an adult to get a proper opinion of it. Basically, King Acrisius of Argos (Donald Houston) banishes his daughter Danaë (Vida Taylor) and his new-born grandson Perseus to sea. It is revealed that Perseus is the son of Zeus (Laurence Olivier), king of the gods. In retribution, Zeus orders Poseidon (Jack Gwillim) to release the last of the Titans, a gigantic sea monster called the Kraken, to destroy Argos, and Acrisius is killed in the destruction. Danaë and Perseus safely float to the island of Seriphos, where Perseus (Harry Hamlin) grows to adulthood. Calibos (Neil McCarthy), the spoiled and rebellious son of the sea goddess Thetis (Dame Maggie Smith), is betrothed to Princess Andromeda (Judi Bowker), daughter of Queen Cassiopeia of Joppa (Siân Phillips). But for committing several atrocities against Zeus, Zeus transforms Calibos into a deformed monstrous satyr-like creature. In revenge, Thetis transports Perseus from Seriphos to an abandoned amphitheatre in Joppa. There he befriends elderly poet named Ammon (Batman's Burgess Meredith) and soldier Thallo (Tim Pigott-Smith). Perseus learns that Andromeda is under a curse and cannot marry unless her suitor, who faces execution if he fails, successfully answers a riddle concocted by Calibos. Zeus realises that his son has been sent to a dangerous region of the world and sends a helmet from Athena (Susan Fleetwood) which makes its wearer invisible, a magical sword from Aphrodite (Dr. No's Ursula Andress), and a shield with a reflective underside from Hera (Claire Bloom). Wearing the helmet, Perseus captures Pegasus, the only remaining sacred flying horse of Zeus; the others were destroyed by Calibos. He follows Calibos's giant vulture carrying a cage which Andromeda's spirit enters as she sleeps to learn the next riddle. Perseus is discovered and nearly killed by Calibos, but he severs one of Calibos's hands, losing his helmet in the process. The next morning, Perseus meets Andromeda as her husband-to-be and correctly answers the riddle, winning Andromeda's hand in marriage. With Thetis unable to act against Perseus, Calibos demands that she take vengeance on Joppa. At the wedding in Thetis' temple, an earthquake shakes the temple, causing the head of the statue of Thetis to break off, and Thetis speaks through it, demanding Andromeda be sacrificed to the Kraken on pain of Joppa's destruction. Perseus seeks a way to defeat the Kraken, but Pegasus is captured by Calibos and his men. Zeus commands Athena to send her owl Bubo as a replacement for the lost helmet, but instead she orders Hephaestus (Pat Roach) to build a mechanical replica of Bubo as an aid for Perseus. Bubo finds Perseus and leads him, Andromeda, Ammon, Thallo and some soldiers to the Stygian Witches. The three cannibalistic witches (Flora Robson, Anna Manahan, and Freda Jackson) share a magical glass orb which they use as an eye. Perseus steals the eye and forces the witches to reveal that the only way to defeat the Kraken. They tell him that he must use the head of the Medusa, whose gaze can turn any living thing into stone. Medusa lives on an island in the River Styx at the edge of the Underworld. The next day, the group continue their journey without Andromeda and Ammon, who return to Joppa. On the Gorgon's island, most of the men are killed, and Perseus fights and kills Medusa's guardian, a large two-headed dog named Dioskilos. Perseus and two other soldiers enter Medusa's lair, where the Gorgon kills the other two men, one with an arrow in the back, the other with her gaze turning him to stone. Perseus uses the reflective underside of his shield to deceive Medusa, and when she approaches him, he decapitates her, and collect her head; but the shield is dissolved by her corrosive blood. Perseus and the remaining men form a camp for the night. Calibos arrives and punctures the cloak carrying Medusa's head, causing her blood to spill and spawn three giant scorpions. Perseus's remaining escorts, including Thallo, are killed by the scorpions. Perseus defeats the scorpions, then finds and kills Calibos. Perseus sends Bubo to rescue Pegasus from Calibos's henchmen and, weakened and exhausted, he collapses in the amphitheatre in Joppa. Andromeda is shackled to the sea cliffs outside Joppa, and the Kraken is summoned. Bubo diverts the Kraken's attention, until Perseus appears on Pegasus. Perseus petrifies the Kraken with Medusa's head, causing it to turn to stone and crumble to pieces into the sea. He then tosses the head into the sea, frees Andromeda, and marries her. The gods predict that Perseus and Andromeda will live happily, rule wisely, and produce children, and Zeus forbids the other gods to pursue vengeance against them. Perseus, Andromeda, Pegasus, and Cassiopeia are honoured in the constellations. Hamlin looks the part as the hero, and the star-studded cast including Olivier and Smith all do well, but the performances that steal the show are that of the stop-motion creatures created by the genius of Ray Harryhausen, especially the nasty snake-haired Medusa. The mythological story is just about easy to follow, the special effects are entertaining, and there is a good score by Laurence Rosenthal, it is cheesy and slow at times, but overall, it is something the whole family can enjoy, a fun fantasy adventure. Worth watching!",Clash of the Titans
12,rmax304823,On Old Olympus's Towering Top.....,7,12 April 2008,"Harry Hamlin is Perseus, a young Greek who, in this version anyway, is sent on a quest for the head of Medusa, one of the Gorgons, whose gaze turns everybody who looks at her into stone. Hamlin takes up this suicidal challenge for love of Andromeda (Judi Bowker), an innocent beauty who looks barely emerged from adolescence. (Like, about five minutes ago.) If Perseus and his handful of men don't come back with the head of Medusa in a month, Andromeda will be sacrificed to the sea monster, the Kraken.Perseus succeeds but, along the way, encounters many dangers. The dangers give Ray Harryhausen a chance to exercise his animation powers, helped along by some newly developed technology. Oh, the effects aren't as realistic as CGIs, but they're charming in their own right. They bear the personalized stamp of Ray Harryhausen. Thetis, one of the several gods and goddesses, hates Perseus because he's the favorite illegitimate son of Zeus, and she tries to sabotage him at each opportunity. Zeus, Laurence Olivier, the King of the Gods, of course favors Perseus and helps him out by giving him such useful gifts as a magic sword, a helmet that makes him invisible, a mechanical owl, and so forth. This Zeus gets around, by the way. He is not only the illegitimate father of Perseus (impregnating his mother while disguised as a shower of coins) but of Medusa as well (impregnating her mother while disguised as a stallion). Then there was Leda (disguised as a swan) and who knows who else. It's good to be the King of the Gods.The acting is perfunctory but that's okay because nobody has much of a chance to act anyway. Except -- and I hate to say this because it sounds so -- so -- ordinary -- except for Laurence Olivier in his relatively minor role. Note how he informs his dialog. When he tells Athena that he'd like her to give her owl to Perseus, he turns half away from her and adds, ""It is my wish. My -- command?"" And his voice is tentative and filled with uncertainty. He's practically begging her in that imperative line. (Athena tells him to shove it.) It takes skill to send that kind of mixed message without being obvious about it.The scene with Medusa is kind of spooky. She was supposed to have horse-like qualities but here she's more of a snake. A rattlesnake, to be precise, which I don't think can be found in the original tale. Rattlesnakes are New World phenomena. (Kids, this story is supposed to take place a couple of hundred years BCE. PS: Columbus didn't discover America until 1492, the same year he lost his shoe.) Pretty well done, and much better than some of the others that were simply ground out for their sensation value. Here, some of the characters actually seem human. Even the gods seem human, which they were to the early Greeks, full of love, jealousy, lust, and other hominid passions.",Clash of the Titans

14,BA_Harrison,Far from Harryhausen's finest hour.,4,1 July 2012,"This was Ray Harryhausen's last feature length film, and it's pretty easy to understand why...Released not long after the success of Star Wars, its muddled Greek lore (spliced with a touch of Norse mythology for good measure) was seriously out of vogue—audiences wanted spaceships, robots and laser swords, not ancient history. An awful 'cute' metallic owl—a blatant attempt at providing the film with a comedic R2D2-style sidekick—is simply embarrassing and did little to help matters.The acting is lousy. Harry Hamlin is abysmal in the lead role of Perseus and Judi Bowker fares little better as Andromeda; both look good, but are more lifeless than one of Medusa's victims. Even the more distinguished thesps—Maggie Smith, Laurence Olivier, Burgess Meredith—are bad, with Smith easily winning my award for Worst Supporting Actress.The other stars of the film—Harryhausen's special effects—are even more disappointing, being far from the legend's best work. Compared to his impressive creations in the Sinbad films and Jason and the Argonauts, the stop-motion work in Clash seems terribly unrefined, the poorly designed models and the jerky animation failing to fill the viewer with intended sense of awe. The visual effects used in tandem with the animation are equally weak—especially the crap matte work.The less said about the cheesy set design (plastic skeletons and dry-ice!) and use of hairy dwarfs as minions to bad-guy Calibos, the better.Even if I were to allow my admiration for Harryhausen and a serious sense of nostalgia to affect my judgement (I first saw this in 1980, aged 12), I simply cannot bring myself to praise Clash of the Titans as a classic; rather, it is a regrettable swansong in the career of a special effects genius.",Clash of the Titans
15,Quinoa1984,"solid fantasy for kids and Greek-God buffs, OK for everyone else",7,10 August 2008,"If you notice the credits listing, the film is directed by Desmond Davis and written by Beverley Cross- both pretty competent at directing and writing duties respectively- but if mentioning Clash of the Titans to someone, it would be most likely recommendable as a Ray Harryhausen picture. While he was only co-producer and creature of the special effects and creatures, its his mark that is most indelible and, frankly, the best reason to see the movie. If you're already big into learning and loving Greek mythology (Zeus, Aprhodite, Medusa, Poseidon, and Zeus's son Perseus), then it should have some appeal as a mix-and-match of stories and lore strung together. It's about how Perseus has to save his future wife Andromeda from the Krakken (not from Greek mythology, but it'll do), and has to get Medusa's head! Luckily, he has the help of a little mechanical owl from the Gods, but he also has to contend with the monster son of Thetis, Calibos, and the ultimate task at hand.To say the least, it's one-dimensional acting and plotting and characterization, which maybe is accurate to the form of storytelling in the Greek days. Zeus is acted by Olivier as if it's a walk in the park, Maggie Smith is there for some OK work as a mad-God-mother who sets the story off, Harry Hamlin has the charm of a log, and Judi Bowker is beautiful as can be; only Bugess Meredith injects a little life here and there as the poet/playwright Ammon. And yet, even with this, Clash of the Titans is entertaining as a fairly well directed adventure film that had I seen it for the first time as a kid I would've been impressed (and yes, parents, show it to your CGI-addled tots and see their eyes light up at the cute and awesome owl and the terrifying Medusa). Most of all, it's another triumph for Harryhausen, where with clever editing, lots of dedication and craft, he makes these creatures and setting come alive in a kind of reality of fantasy, if that makes sense, that wouldn't be possible to capture in computer animation.Is it a little dated? Sure, no argument there; it was a kind of last hurrah for Harryhausen with this brand of sweeping mythological epic film-making, though it would still be another 10 years before T2 and Jurassic Park changed everything. But for what it's worth, it's rollicking fun for a Saturday morning.",Clash of the Titans
16,JohnHowardReid,How not to make an epic movie!,6,2 May 2017,"Maggie Smith has won more awards and nominations than anyone else I know, so it's a shame to find her giving the most amateurish performance of her career in this movie. Admittedly, she was pressed hard by an incredibly woeful line-up led by Sir Laurence Olivier of all people. To add insult to injury, the hero is wet and the heroine offers little more than the charm of youth. This general thespic malaise even extends to Burgess Meredith. Admittedly, his is easily the most capable performance in the whole show, but why didn't he seize the opportunity to turn his role into a comic character? Admittedly, the whole movie improves truly dramatically in its last half-hour, but by that time all this really good stuff is totally wasted because most of the audience has frittered away. The preview theatre was packed to the doors at the start. Two hours later, at the end of the movie, there were just over fifty of us left!",Clash of the Titans
17,wes-connors,Harryhausen presents Harry Hamlin,7,27 September 2011,"In mythological Greece, Godly leader Laurence Olivier (as Zeus) mates with a royal mortal, producing handsome, muscular adult Harry Hamlin (as Perseus). With some help from Burgess Meredith (as Ammon), Mr. Hamlin sets out to win the hand of attractive Judi Bowker (as Andromeda), but Maggie Smith (as Thetis) wants Mr. Bowker to mate with her much uglier son. Hamlin must battle all creatures great and greater, as envisioned by special effects wizard Ray Harryhausen, in his last feature film...Hamlin is a perfect Perseus, but the all-star supporting cast adds surprisingly little. Arguably the only one really earning his paycheck is Mr. Meredith. Of course, it helps that Meredith is given the least dull supporting role; others have precious little to make an impression with. The Gods are a bore. Behind his sex symbol looks, Hamlin was sometimes undervalued as a serious actor. Much later, playing a scene with him was difficult; so he keenly and generously went over the lines and motivations, making it easy. Watching Hamlin and Meredith is fun, Ms. Bowker is nakedly beautiful, and the visual effects keep it lively.******* Clash of the Titans (6/12/81) Desmond Davis ~ Harry Hamlin, Judi Bowker, Burgess Meredith, Laurence Olivier",Clash of the Titans

Schneer's films. But as always, change happened and the new heads of the studio no longer wanted to pay for such a big budget. Schneer took it to Orion Pictures, who insisted on Arnold Schwarzenegger playing the lead, but at that point, Arnold was unproven at dialogue. So that took the movie to MGM.The producer wanted better-known actors to play the Gods in order to improve the film's chances at the box office. He got exactly what he wanted, thanks to Maggie Smith as Thetis, Claire Bloom as Hera, Ursula Andress as Aphrodite and Laurence Olivier as Zeus. But the real star in this movie is Harryhausen, making his final film and giving us Calibos, Pegasus, Bubo the mechanical owl, Dioskilos, Medusa, the scorpions and the Kraken, which was a toy that I asked for to no avail.While this film came out at the same time as Raiders of the Lost Ark, it was still one of 1981's biggest hits. The story of Perseus (Harry Hamlin) and his love for Andromeda became one that 80s kids would know by heart. Sure, the Kraken is from Norse mythology and Calibos is from Shakespeare, but why argue?Director Desmond Davis mostly worked in TV, but he does a fine job here.

20,Scarecrow-88,Clash of the Titans,7,26 March 2010,"Perseus(Harry Hamlin), the son of Zeus(the great Laurence Olivier), a mortal who is heir to the kingdom of Argos, must vanquish the monstrous sea monster, Kraken, in order to save a princess, Andromeda(the impossibly beautiful Judi Bowker)doomed by their goddess Thetis(Maggie Smith)for the decapitated hand of her accursed son, Colibos(Neil McCarthy). Colibos was once a man destined to marry Andromeda, a curse placed on him which removed his handsomeness, rendering him hoof-heeled monstrosity with a tail, forehead horns, and deformed facial features. Thetis wishes to put Perseus in harm's way and Zeus commands that his goddess wives provide his son with proper equipment necessary to defend himself against those that would threaten his life and well being.While I do consider this a step down from other films featuring Harryhausen's superb stop motion animated monsters, the master's magnificence still shines bright with such creatures as the winged stallion Pegasus, Colibos from a distance(..close-ups of McCarthy only reveal him in make-up from the neck up), a giant vulture which brings a caged Andromeda to Colibos' hidden lair in a marsh swampland, Medusa(whose head was needed to defeat the Kraken, considered invulnerable)with the hair of snakes along with her rattling tail(..her look turning any living creature into stone and blood considered poisonous and deadly), the golden owl(..who guides Perseus to the shrine of 3 blind, grotesque Stygian witches who eat humans, use a glowing crystal as their eye, and know a possible secret in defeating Kraken), large scorpions born from the blood of Medusa's head, and, of course, the Kraken. Such places Perseus finds himself include the amphitheater in Joppa where he encounters and befriends the loyal and wise Ammon(the delightful Burgess Meredith), accompanying him on several sojourns, the ""Lair of the Lord of the Marsh"" where he discovers Colibos' hideaway(..also learning of his hypnotic curse over Andromeda regarding a riddle that sends possible suitors to be burned alive if they fail to answer it correctly), Medusa's darkened lair found in the ruins of a forgotten city, and across the River Styx after paying the ferryman a coin(the ferryman a skeleton underneath a cloak who boats them across to an island to encounter the dreaded Medusa). I think the Medusa sequence was simply difficult to top, which may be why(to me anyway)the final showdown between Perseus and Kraken isn't quite as impressive, although the monster is still quite a sight to behold. I think the target audience for this kind of adventure fantasy, which is essentially a series of perilous journeys supplying Perseus with hurdles to overcome, with more than a little assistance from the gods(the sword which protects him many times, in particular against Medusa, the helmet of invisibility, and the sword that can even slice apart marble), will please the fans of Harryhausen and of the sword and sorcery genre. Not quite as satisfying as ""Jason and the Argonauts"" or ""The Golden Voyage of Sinbad"", but I think it'll have more than enough to entertain the appropriate crowd it is made for. Olivier seems to be enjoying himself as the all powerful Zeus while the mortals, for the exception of Meredith, seem cast more for their looks.",Clash of the Titans
21,Hey_Sweden,I loved this as a kid.,7,10 September 2015,"Inspired by the figures of Greek mythology, ""Clash of the Titans"" tells the tale of Perseus (Harry Hamlin), the mortal son of the god Zeus (who else but Laurence Olivier). In order to meet his destiny, Perseus will be made to face one challenge after another. Zeus and other gods offer assistance at every opportunity, although Perseus's mission will be hindered by the vengeful god Thetis (Maggie Smith), whose son Calibos was turned into a freak for his misdeeds.Yes, ""Clash of the Titans"" '81 is most likely to appeal to the young and young at heart, who should experience a fair amount of wonder. It might not be meaty enough or intense enough for more adult viewers, but overall it's still an engaging, well produced, well shot (on locations in Spain, Italy, and Malta) fantasy adventure. Production design, cinematography, and music are all assets. It does have some mighty fine sequences, especially the taming of the winged horse Pegasus, and the terrifying showdown with the gorgon Medusa, the hideous beast who turns living things to stone if they look at her face.This has a first rate cast of veterans. Olivier is somewhat hammy, but not unbearably so. Also appearing are Claire Bloom, Ursula Andress, Jack Gwillim, Burgess Meredith, Sian Phillips, and Flora Robson. Some don't get to do a whole lot, but Smith is fun as one of the antagonists of the piece. Then-newcomers Hamlin and beautiful Judi Bowker as his love interest Andromeda aren't great actors, but they have enough appeal going for them. Neil McCarthy is quite good, buried under heavy makeup as the evil Calibos.The real star of the movie, though, as anyone would tell you, is special effects legend Ray Harryhausen. His stop motion visuals are once again a joy to behold, and his characters have a charm that even the best CGI can't touch. The one ""immortal"" for whom some viewers may have little to no patience is the mechanical owl Bubo, who's just a little too precious.It may not be terribly faithful to actual Greek mythology, but one shouldn't really expect history lessons from escapist entertainment like this anyway.Seven out of 10.",Clash of the Titans
22,poolandrews,"""Release the Kraken"" Highly entertaining fantasy adventure based on Greek mythology.",8,17 December 2005,"Clash of the Titans starts with King Acrisius (Donald Houston) of Argos (no not the shop!) sealing his daughter Danae (Vida Taylor) & her young baby son Perseus in a coffin & throwing it into the sea in an act of defiance against the father of the gods Zeus (Laurence Oliver) who happens to be father of Perseus. In anger Zeus commands Poseidon (Jack Gwillim) the god of the sea to release a huge monster known as the Kraken to destroy the city of Argos & also tells him to make sure Danae & Perseus make dry land safely. Years later & Perseus (Harry Hamlin) has grown into a young man, meanwhile Zeus has to punish Calibos (Neil McCarthy) the son of the god Thetis (Maggie Smith) for his crimes & evil ways. Zues turns Calibos into a deformed monster who lives like an outcast in a swamp near the city of Joppur where he used to live & was going to marry the beautiful Princess Andromeda (Judi Bowker). In revenge Thetis transports Perseus to Joppur where he falls in love with Andromeda, once again Thetis isn't happy about this & tells Queen Cassieopeia (Sian Philips) that in 30 days the Kraken will be set free to destroy Joppur unless Andromeda is chained to a stone & offered as a sacrifice. Perseus sets out on a quest to find the knowledge which will let him defeat the Kraken, a journey which takes him to the Stygian witches, the Isle of the Dead & encounters with various monsters, perils & dangers...This English production was directed by Desmond Davis & is a terrificly entertaining fantasy adventure, the like of which they just don't make anymore. The script by Beverley Cross doesn't retell any one particular myth but jumbles several up together & even adds some ideas of it's own. While Clash of the Titans moves along at a nice pace & is never boring or dull the film seems somewhat overly complicated with lots of twist's, turns & distractions which seemed unnecessary while some of the narrative was a bit muddled. Having said that at least it tries to have some depth & it works most of the time. The character's are a bit bland & dull but serve their purpose as the real star of the show are the monsters which are great. I'm not sure about the comedy relief clockwork Owl Bubo though, who at the end turns up with a bandaged foot & mini walking stick under his wing!Director Desmond does what he can & while the film is competent nothing really stands out except those monsters, of course. The best sequence is when Perseus fights Medusa in her flame lit labyrinth, the lighting is great in this scene & has tension & atmosphere to it. I thought the skeleton ferryman was quite creepy as well. Surprisingly there is a couple of shots with female nudity & a bit of gore as well.With a supposed budget of about $15,000,000 Clash of the Titans is a well made film with nice varied locations from dark swamps, ancient temples & cities, Medusa's labyrinth & tropical islands which give it an attractive look throughout. The special effects are stop-motion created by the legendary Ray Harryhausen & Clash of the Titans became his last film project to date as CGI & other more sophisticated forms of effects took over. They are generally excellent as you would expect from a giant Vulture, the Kraken a giant four armed sea monster (actually taken from Scandinavian mythology), a two-headed Dog, the deformed Calibos, Pegasus the flying horse & my favourites the fantastic Snake-haired Medusa & the cool Scorpions. On the down side compared to today's multi million CGI effects they come off as a distant second best with a slight jerkiness & grainy blue-screen imposition although they have a certain personality & charm that compensates somewhat. The acting isn't the best, Ursula Andress gets two lines of dialogue during the whole film despite her almost top billing in the credits.Clash of the Titans is a highly entertaining fantasy adventure that I think is well worth a watch, so what are you waiting for?",Clash of the Titans

In a way, it's a loving tribute to a kind of movie that had died out by 1981. We still have attempts to make these types of movies today (even a remake of this film), but the results are not the same. I'm not saying they aren't sometimes enjoyable in their way but CGI just doesn't have the charm and appeal of old-school special effects. The focus today is on realism, not imagination. Frankly, trying to tell a story that involves gods, winged horses, and Medusa ""realistically"" makes no sense to me. Embrace the fantasy or just avoid it altogether and make another movie about cops or drug dealers. The cast here is good, even Harry Hamlin. Yes, some of these great older actors appear to be slumming but they all treat the material seriously and refrain from hamming it up. There's a lesson that could be taught to today's cynical thespians, I think. Mini-rants aside, this is a very fun movie for those who enjoy old-fashioned sword & sandal movies and classic special effects. Fans of Greek mythology should have a field day with it, as well.",Clash of the Titans
24,zardoz-13,Not as Good as Earlier Harryhausen Epics,7,3 April 2010,"Producer Charles H. Schneer teamed up with stop-motion special effects wizard Ray Harryhausen on a number of fantasy films beginning with director Robert Gordon's ""It Came From Beneath the Sea"" (1955). Anyway, Schneer and Harryhausen followed up with ""Earth Vs. Flying Saucers"" (1956), ""20 Million Miles to Earth"" (1957), ""The 3 Worlds of Gulliver"" (1960), ""Mysterious Island,"" (1961), and ""First Men in the Moon"" (1964), but they are primarily remembered for the fantasy films about Arabian and Greek mythology, including ""The Seventh Voyage of Sinbad"" (1958), ""Jason and the Argonauts"" (1963), ""The Golden Voyage of Sinbad"" (1974) and ""Sinbad and the Eye of the Tiger"" (1977). The final film they collaborated on was ""Girl with Green Eyes"" director Desmond Davis' ""Clash of the Titans"" with Harry Hamlin and Judi Bowker. The prestigious supporting cast included Laurence Olivier, Ursula Andress, Maggie Smith, and Burgess Meredith. An old hand at writing mythical adventures, scenarist Beverley Cross had penned the scripts for ""Sinbad and the Eye of the Tiger"" and ""Jason and the Argonauts."" Not surprisingly, Cross took some liberties with Greek mythology, specifically the myth of Perseus and Andromeda, to make things more palatable for twentieth century audiences. Some of the narrative elements have been reorganized. For example, Perseus had slain the Medusa before he married Andromeda. Anybody familiar with Greek myths knows that the Kraken was a mythological Scandinavian a sea monster. Furthermore, our legendary hero had nothing like the mechanical owl Bubo to help him out. Nevertheless, despite some cheesy special effects and the clunky owl, ""Clash of the Titans"" is an enjoyable epic about supernatural beings and mortals. A gigantic sea monster threatens to destroy a kingdom unless our hero can kill it, but no mortal man stands a chance against the beast, unless he comes equipped to battle it with the severed head of the Medusa. Since both the sea beast and Medusa are titans, the origin of the title lays in their clash.""Clash of the Titans"" consists of a number of trials that the young hero Perseus (Harry Hamlin of ""Strange Wilderness""), the son of Zeus, must survive before he can marry Andromeda (Judi Bowker of ""Brother Sun, Sister Moon"") and they can rule together. The film unfolds as King Acrisius of Argos (Donald Houston of ""633 Squadron"") confines his daughter, Danaë (Vida Taylor of ""God Told Me To"") and infant son Perseus, to a wooden ark, because a prophecy stipulated that would perish if his daughter gave birth to a son. Meanwhile, Zeus observes this event from aloft as a seagull and he wings his way back to Mount Olympus where he orders Poseidon to loosen the last of the titans, the Kraken, to devastate the kingdom of Argos and kill every single person for the blasphemy that Acrisius has perpetrated. Ironically, Acrisius' effort to thwart the prophecy backfires on him. Zeus also tells Poseidon (Jack Gwillim of ""Patton""); to make sure that Danaë and her son weather the seas and land safely at an island out of harm's way. When one of the gods, Thetis (Maggie Smith of ""The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie""), reminds Zeus about the many temples that Acrisius built as tribute to Zeus, the god of all gods states: ""A hundred good deeds cannot atone for one murder."" Meantime, Zeus grows weary of Thetis's sadistic but handsome son, Calibos (Neil McCarthy of ""Where Eagles Dare""), who has hunted down and exterminated every steed from Zeus' hallowed herd of winged horses, except Pegasus. Despite Thetis' pleads for mercy, Zeus turns Calibos into a hideous looking fellow and ostracizes him to the swamp. Calibos had been predestined to wed Princess Andromeda, the daughter of Queen Cassiopeia (Sian Phillips) and heir to the rich city of Joppa. At the same time, Perseus grows up in obscurity on the island of Seriphos. Eventually, out of revenge for Zeus' punishment of her son, Thetis decides it is time for Perseus to ""time you came face to face with fear"" and transports young Perseus from Seriphos to Joppa in the kingdom of Phoenicia. Perseus lies down to sleep on the sea shore of Seriphos and awakens in an amphitheater in Joppa when he meets playwright Ammon (Burgess Meredith of ""Hurry Sundown"") who explains that the city is under a curse. ""Call no man happy who is not dead"" is the recurring slogan heard in Joppa. Perseus explains that he is the heir to Argos. It seems that his mother's last wish was to restore Argos. Watching all of this from above, Zeus orders the gods to forge ""weapons of divine temper"" for his son. Perseus winds up with a helmet of invisibility, a shield, and a sacred sword so that his son can protect himself. Perseus learns more about the deformed Calibos and the curse. All suitors seeking Andromeda's hand die because they cannot answer the riddle. He sneaks into Andromeda's bedroom. He watches as she sleep walks into a cage a giant vulture flies to the swamp. Later, Perseus cuts off Calibos' hand, answers the riddle correctly so that he can marry the princess, but Queen Cassiopeia (Sian Phillips) brags about her daughter's beauty and Thetis condemns Andromeda to death. In thirty days, the Kraken will kill her unless Perseus can prevent it. Perseus learns that the only way to slay the Kraken with Medusa's head. ""Clash of the Titans"" seems more juvenile than the previous Schneer & Harryhausen collaborations. The battle between the Medusa and Perseus in her dimly-lighted palace as she slithers around with her reptilian body is about as good as this film gets. Later, the blood of the Medusa is shed and her blood turns into large scorpions, but they seem more like an annoyance than a challenge. Perseus' avowed enemy Calibos never stops giving our hero grief until he slays him by slinging his sword into the villainous satyr's belly. ""Clash of the Titans"" isn't half as good as ""Jason and the Argonauts.""",Clash of the Titans
25,Boba_Fett1138,Entertaining but yet not halve as good as it potentially could had been.,7,7 April 2010,"While watching this movie you'll notice dozens of things that could had been done way better. It has such a fine and entertainingly fun concept but yet it takes a while for the movie to really take off. It's also not a really well done movie directing or acting wise and it's also not always the best looking film. ""Clash of the Titans"" was really a special-effects loaded movie, that always had been bound to be remade with modern technologies. This movie was already outdated back in 1981. And even though the remake isn't the best or most satisfying one I still have always welcomed a remake of this 1981 movie.This movie has always been regarded as the last of its kind. Literally dozens of these type of movies based on Greek mythology and other heroic characters battling monsters got produced from the late '50's on already. The genre was already pretty much regarded to have dried up in the '70's but yet the still managed to make this movie, that is the last to use of the usual and distinctive elements of the genre.One of the most notable elements of course are the Ray Harryhausen stop-motion effects for all of the creatures. Even though the movie is being filled with lots of other big effects, the stop-motion effects are still the ones that stand out. It needs to be said though that not all of the effects seem completely necessary. They could had really used some other techniques at the time for some of its effects. It also seems quite pointless really that the Calibos character is halve stop-motion effect and halve make-up effects with an actor underneath, for the close-ups and the talking moments.You can tell by watching this movie that they had tons of good and original ideas and they tried to be really creative but yet it doesn't all quite work out. One of the reasons why a remake was really welcome. The movie is at times a bit cheap, lame and awkward looking, which has most likely to do with budgeting reasons and the inexperience with these type of 'big' movies of the director and other people involved.The acting is really quite poor. Just like ever genre movie, the main lead is just a pretty muscle boy without any acting skills. It makes it hard to really feel involved with the character but yet the movie manages to still do so, due to mostly its effects and adventurous story. It's quite odd seeing the great Laurence Olivier acting in a film like this but even he simply needed some big pay checks it seems.Yet somehow despite this all the movie manages to be fun and entertaining to watch. It's foremost because it simply has an entertaining concept, that features plenty of action and monstrous creatures. It's a movie with a real classic hero that devise all odds by taking on some powerful and superior creatures.

Simply put: some immortals did some shady stuff with humans, some humans disrespected the immortals, there was a lot of jealousy and vengeance from both worlds, and the titans ended up paying the price.Acrisius, King of Argos, was punished. So, Perseus, the rightful heir to Argos, had to ride Pegasus and defeat Calibos in order to marry Andromeda. I know, the name Andromeda just doesn't fit. They should've thought about that when writing this. If her name was Andromedus it would have sounded so much better with Perseus, Pegasus, and Acrisius. Ah well.It was exciting stuff though. Seeing Perseus encounter all of these different creatures all in a quest to fulfill his destiny. Kind of like Luke Skywalker.But really, what was this movie all about? ""Gods"" behaving badly.

Burgess Meredith gives a sprightly turn playing essentially the same role to Hamlin's Perseus as he did to Stallone's Rocky. Assorted minor British supporting actors perform perfectly serviceably in a range of supporting roles. And Judi Bowker - elegant, vulnerable, and so beautiful that her porcelain delicacy brings tears to your eyes - reminds one that she is a much missed absence from the screen following her effective retirement to occasional TV work after this film.But the real stars are, of course, Harryhausen's stop motion creations, where the Oscar goes to Medusa - the most chilling chunk of rubber on a steel armature ever created. And the booby prize goes to the hugely unwelcome R2D2-lite comedy clockwork owl Bubo, the least necessary character in any movie ever (please please please don't let there be a Bubo in the remake).

The title is symbolic in terms of players. The titans could be Perseus verses the evil Calibos who was struck down and deformed by Zeus. It could ultimately be Medusa verses sea monster the Kraken but it is Perseus who beheads Medusa to turn the Kraken to stone from her gaze thus saving the Princess Andromeda from sacrifice. Directed by Desmond Davis with impressive sets and locations of palaces, caves and swamps. Harry Hamlin is a suitable Perseus who was raised after he and his mother was abandoned at sea. He will grow to pursue Andromeda's hand but to do so he must face extreme dangers in the forms of Medusa whose hair is ridden with snakes and her eyes turn flesh to stone. Judi Bowker is stunning as Andromeda whose soul is cursed to revisit the domain of Calibos but she refuses his advances thus further enduring his curse. Burgess Meredith plays playwright Ammon who provides Perseus with advice and companionship particularly during the taming of Pegasus. Laurence Olivier plays the authority of Zeus who utters the famous command, ""Let loose the Kraken!"" Maggie Smith plays sea goddess Thetis, vengeful mother of Calibos.

Consequently, because they were so much more real than cartoons, I found them to be quite frightening. If they were made of real people, then the monsters must be real, too. Clash of the Titans was particularly scary. The man who makes Zeus so angry he gets transformed into a hideous beast, Medusa's deadly tentacled head, and the Kraken were enough to give me nightmares.Now, as a grown-up, it's still a little scary to watch. But all I have to do for a smile instead of a fright is remember the hilarious scene from The Last Action Hero when Joan Plowright says to her students that they might know Laurence Olivier from Polaroid commercials or from playing Zeus in Clash of the Titans. Depending on your point of view, it's either incredibly cool or incredibly silly for serious actors Laurence Olivier, Maggie Smith, and Claire Bloom to don togas and hang out in Mount Olympus.Watching it for the first time today will probably make you laugh at the special effects, even though they were very impressive and fun back in 1981.

33,FlashCallahan,Destroy Argos!!!!.........,7,19 March 2010,"By answering a seemingly impossible riddle, Perseus, the son of Zeus, wins the hand of the Princess Andromeda in marriage. Trouble appears in the shape of Calibos, the princess's former love, and his mother, the Goddess Thetis. In order that the dreaded Kraken not be released, Andromeda has to be sacrificed and Perseus searches for the Medusa; her head is the only thing that can stop the Kraken...Greek mythology is a thing of wonderment, anyone can tell you a story about a part beast, part human being with powers that would kill a mortal man until the cows come home, and it wouldn't be boring, all you need is a good moral, set up, and a good wholesome hero.Which this film has in droves. Admittedly, the first act is a little bit on the boring side, with Laurence Olivier loving every minute playing the God of Gods and barking orders to everyone while sitting in front of some nice strobe lighting.When the second act starts, thats when the film picks up and we get to see what we all wanted to see, stop-motion monsters!! We do get a sub-plot featuring Burgess Meredith as a sort of ancient Greek Micky, giving advice to Hamlin, but we are more interested in his quest to feat the Kraken.It runs at an okay pace, but it's just too campy to be boring in any way. So we follow Hamlin on his adventure, along with Pegasus and a robotic owl that is in no way based on R2-D2.the set pieces are great, and the Medusa scene is still as eerie and tense as i can remember it to be. Although it's not a classic movie, it's still fun and scary in places, but predictably some of the effects look a little dated now, but they still work in some scenes.A good old fashioned adventure movie.",Clash of the Titans

This movie has a bunch of Greek mythology and a lot of stop motion animation.  I am not the biggest fan of this technique, but when Ray Harryhausen is involved it is usually rather good...he is the best. This movie has it all swordfights, monsters, and mechanical owls.  The story follows our hero as he tries to save the princess from first this monster guy, then the deadly Kraken a giant beast.  Medusa, Cerberus, and the three blind witches are in this one too.  This one is a really good movie to show your kids that is enjoyable to adults as well.",Clash of the Titans

36,StevePulaski,Clash of the early and entertaining effects,6,31 December 2010,"Clash of the Titans isn't my kind of film. It's actions may consume the screen, Greek mythology isn't my area of expertise. That doesn't mean I didn't enjoy some of what it did have to offer. It's got great fun, exciting characters, a well developed stop-motion monster, and some catchy music. The one problem I found was it's a bit slow in terms of story line. While the film doesn't consistently rely on intense action scenes, there are some dialog scenes that were just droning and hard to get into unless you enjoy the subject. For an average guy like me, it wasn't fun listening to Greek speak.The effects do justice in this film. The Kraken is perfectly depicted in this film, thanks to special effect genius Ray Harryhausen. I really love the way the monster is stop motion, unlike in the more recent version it's just CGI. CGI WAS around in 1981. The first film to utilize in it's full capabilities was Disney's Tron in 1982, followed by The Last Starfighter in 1984. Of course there were some films to use it between the year gap, but those were the big ones. CGI wasn't like it was now. Films only used it if they couldn't due without it. Clash of the Titans uses one of my favorite styles of animation; stop-motion animation. A tiring, yet rewarding process in the film world.The storyline, was confusing to me, but I'll do my best to explain it. Perseus (Hamlin) who is now in the city of Joppa, thanks to the God Zeus (Olivier). In Joppa, Perseus falls in love with Princess Andromeda (Nowker) who is imprisoned. Perseus desperately wants a relationship with this girl, but Joppa sends Andromeda to be fed to The Kraken, a sea monster who is the last Titan. Now Perseus needs to find the Medusa head to use it to freeze The Kraken, and rescue Andromeda.That was a mouthful. As far to my knowledge, the film stays pretty much true to the original story of Perseus. I have not found anything missing or incorrect when reading the Greek mythology portion about him as well. So as being true to it's story, COTT definitely gets a thumbs up there.After a while, the movie becomes a tiny bit of an annoyance. Maybe because I'm not into the film as much as others, but I didn't find it too exciting. The end scene, on the other hand, is very well developed. The scene where Perseus is flying on Pegasus is extremely entertaining. The whole ending is where the movie takes off, and begins to have fun with itself.Clash of the Titans is for a designated audience. I did enjoy parts of the film, but as a whole, I didn't care too much. I'll watch it in a few years, and hopefully get more out of it. But for now, I'll open a book, and read about Perseus rather than watch this. The effects make the movie. But when you're hoping for a shot of The Kraken or another action scene to appear, doesn't that meant you aren't enjoying the movie itself? Just a thought.Starring: Laurence Olivier, Harry Hamlin, Judi Bowker, Maggie Smith, and Ursula Andress. Directed by: Desmond Davis.",Clash of the Titans
37,Smells_Like_Cheese,It's good to be the Zeus!,7,11 June 2010,"Due to the very un-needed remake, Clash of the Titans, it brought back so many memories. I used to watch Clash of the Titans all of the time when I was a kid, I just adored this film, it was one of my favorites. But for some reason, I hadn't seen the movie for years, I think I kind of just forgot about it. Once again though during ""remake mania"" it brought back those good times and I just had to watch Clash of the Titans once again. I don't know how to say this other than just how amazing it is to be so easily amused when you're a kid. I'm not putting this movie down because it is a fun adventure movie and has this charm about it, but I remember when I was a kid and these were just the huge break through effects. I can't help but laugh at them now and how dated they are. Also the acting was a bit over the top cheesy, but once again it's one of those fantasy films from the days where the lines were delivered with ""soap operatic"" tones. I just honestly cannot hate this film, even if it is dated and silly, the story is still so much fun how could you not get into it? It kept the tension high and also creates a lot of excitement.Calibos, is a handsome young man destined to marry Princess Andromeda, the daughter of Queen Cassiopeia and heir to the rich city of Joppa. The God, Zeus transforms Calibos into a satyr-like creature who is subsequently shunned and forced to live as an outcast in the swamps and marshes. Thetis, furious at her son's fate, vows that if Calibos cannot marry Andromeda, no other man will, either. Equally infuriated by Zeus's total devotion for his own son, Thetis transports Perseus from Seriphos to Joppa. Perseus, befriended by Ammon, learns of Andromeda and wishes to marry her. Armed with gifts from the gods, he cuts off the hand of Calibos and releases the curse that was placed upon Andromeda. At the temple to Thetis, Calibos prays to his mother Thetis to take vengeance on Perseus. At the wedding, the statue of Thetis collapses and its head comes to life, demanding Andromeda as a virgin sacrifice to the Kraken in thirty days, or else Joppa will be destroyed. Perseus seeks a way to defeat the Kraken, and must go on a long and dangerous journey to figure a way to save his love and city.Since I shouldn't even mention the remake in this review, all I have to say is that this is better than the new one still. It still managed to keep all the excitement and adventure in less than 2 hours and kept it easy on the eyes. The only sad thing about this movie is that it does need to be updated, the effects are a bit silly. I love how Perseus gets his flying horse and miraculously knows how to ride it in less than a minute. Now granted, he is the son of Zeus, so I'll give him the benefit of the doubt, but man, I guess half-Gods defy wind as well because when he is riding the horse as it flies in the air, his hair only blows a little bit in the background as he keeps perfect balance. Also I loved seeing Zeus as a little tiny crumb in his sea, bad green screen effect. But one thing that I will always give this film credit for, it still gives me the chills. With the three blind witches that Perseus must see to find out how to destroy the Kraken, they were very creepy. Also, no one will ever top that Medusa, quick, sly, strong and tough, this is the girl that will take your breath away, sadly I'm not kidding. But as long as you can get past silly effects and soap opera acting, I think you'll still enjoy this film. It's a great fantasy that I have to admit I will forever have a place in my heart for.7/10",Clash of the Titans

I was awestruck with the magical, mystical overall look and feel of the film. It was larger than life to me.I have re-watched the movie since that time and I still find it to be a great mythological fantasy film!

40,OllieSuave-007,A great mythological adventure!,8,1 April 2014,"This is a great movie with a mythology aspect, telling the story of Perseus (Harry Hamlin), son of Zeus. He has angered the sea goddess Thetis (Maggie Smith) and has fallen in love with Princess Andromeda (Judi Bowker), who used to be engaged to Thetis's son. In order that the dreaded monster Kraken not be released, Andromeda has to be sacrificed. This leaves Perseus searching for the Medusa, whose head is the only thing that can stop the Kraken.Most of the great Gods from Greek myth are here including Zeus, Hera, Poseidon, Aprodite, Hephaestus and Athena. They all watch as Perseus sets off in an incredible quest to find Medusa, filmed in non-stop adventure and action showing the son of Zeus battling hordes of men and creatures that attempt to get in his way. The wrath of the Gods show the power and threat within them; the scene where Thetis' face appear in a talking statue of herself is a gripping effect.The film is set in a magnificent countryside and renaissance-style scenery and the acting was superb, featuring an international cast with each giving a memorable performance. And, all the adventure in a captivating movie leading to the climax's battle royale gives this a must-see adventure film.Grade B+",Clash of the Titans
41,bowmanblue,Classic of the Titans,10,10 May 2020,"First of all I'll confess that I was four years old when 'Clash of the Titans' was released and therefore a story involving Gods, monsters, flying horses and clockwork owls seemed like the greatest adventure ever told. Therefore, my review is tinged with more than a little nostalgia. Anyway, 'Clash of the Titans' is based on the Greek mythology of Perseus and his quest to destroy various (stop motion!) beasties and save the princess - truly a tale from yesteryear!The phrase 'They don't make 'em like they used to' is particularly applicable for many reasons. For a start it may not be totally politically correct to focus an entire story about a man rescuing a 'helpless' maiden from being sacrificed to a monster. Secondly, there isn't a single computer generated special effect to be seen here (don't get me started on the remake!) - all the creatures are lovingly crafted by effects guru Ray Harryhausen and - yes - today they do seem a little dated and you can tell what's been overlayed in post production, plus the acting is a little on the 'dramatic' side compared to modern standards.But, whatever 'flaws' it contains, they all come from how well the film has aged. If you grew up on this sort of thing then it will be as exciting and epic today as it ever was. Yes, the clockwork owl is a little on the 'uber-cute' side, but - again - I was only four when I first saw this and I wanted Boo-boo for Christmas.If there was ever one gripe I probably could say about it was that its leading man never really seemed that charismatic. Yes, he looked the part, but always came off as a little stiff (and possibly in dire need of animating himself!). Luckily, you have superb performances from acting heavyweights such as Laurence Olivier as 'Zeus' himself to more than make up for any (mortal) acting slip-ups.'Clash of the Titans' is one of those rare films that never seemed to get made after the eighties. As soon as 1990 kicked in, films rarely were something that the whole family could sit round the TV on a Saturday afternoon and enjoy together. For all its scares and hideous monsters, 'Clash of the Titans' is a film that can - and should - be appreciated by everyone. Don't judge it by today's standards, just marvel over what can be done with make-up when the hideous Calibos comes on screen and that's nothing compared to how well the snake-haired Medusa is animated. Then you have the dramatic musical score which tops off the film perfectly as one of sheer grandeur and scale. I guess the remake proved that this is a film of its time, but one that deserves its place in film history.",Clash of the Titans
42,The-Sarkologist,Not quite that faithful to the myth,7,21 January 2012,"This movie was released a lot later than I had originally thought. For some reason I believed that it was made in the 60s, however as you watch the movie, noting that the special effects aren't as wonderful as, say, movies made these days, you still get the feel that the effects are somewhat more sophisticated than the average movies one would encounter in the 60s. However, we must remember that making this movie would have been a difficult endeavour in any case because, as mentioned, computer enhanced special effects did not exist back then, but rather clever manipulation with film and models.This movie is based loosely on the Ancient Greek myth of the hero Perseus and alternates between the events on Earth, and the political maneuverings in Olympus. Unfortunately, though, I would hardly call this movie one full of political intrigue. While the idea is ripe for a story of political intrigue in the halls of Olympus, it simply turns out to be a minor tussle between Thetis, Goddess of the Sea, and Zeus. Zeus is portrayed as an autocrat, who is also quite a sleaze (which is what he was in Mythology) and when the lesser gods disagree with him, they tend to mutter in secret. However, I note that a lot of Christian rhetoric about justice and mercy is spurted from the mouth of Zeus, which in the ancient world, simply was not the way of the Gods.As for the story itself, I could pick a number of holes in it, but I will chose not to. In many ways it is similar to the later movie (which was based on this film). However, it is noteworthy that Perseus was not sent on his quest from the city of Joppa (and I do not believe he ever actually went to Joppa in the legend) but rather was sent on his quest from Argos, at the machinations of the reigning king (who had a prophecy saying that Perseus would slay him). He meets Andromeda on his journey, but she was chained to a rock in Ethiopia. She was somebody whom he picked up on his return journey, rather than the center of his quest.This was an okay film, but it had enough that my year 11 history teacher decided to show it in history class once. However, while it is based on the myth, it does not follow it closely. Perseus did not travel with an entourage to find the gorgons, rather he had been given a gift of flying shoes. After he had slain Medusa, the Pegasus appeared, and he then flew back home on it. However, despite the flaws, it is still an entertaining film.",Clash of the Titans
43,digitalbeachbum,Classic Ray Harryhausen,8,8 July 2020,"This story, of Greek origin, is the classic tale of Perseus and his quest to win Andromeda, the princesses. It has a great cast, great direction and Ray Harryhausen's classic stop-motion animation.I know that many new generations will reject this movie because it has no CG but that is because it was made in 1980. The stop-motion animation was the only way to make creatures like the Kraken.There is a lot of filler and creative license, because the original story does not have enough to fill a movie script for 90 minutes. Characters have been added and myths have been mixed together in order to make a feature length movie. The filler isn't so wonderful and after 40 years of passing, the filler becomes tedious.However, the awesomeness of this movie is that it is family friendly. You can have anyone watch this movie and other than the stop-motion claymation of Medusa might be a bit scary for kids, just tell them that the blood from Medusa is sugar goo.This is also Harryhausen's last movie. There was supposed to be Force of the Trojan's but ILM (Star Wars) caused a shift in movie making and the process of making movies in this fashion fell out of favor.",Clash of the Titans
44,Fella_shibby,Ppl in the science fiction n fantasy movies owe a lot to the genius Harryhausen. Learnt a lot about Greek mythology characters thru this.,9,21 August 2016,"I saw this on a VHS in the mid 80s. I really enjoyed this. Bought a VHS in the late 80s, then a vcd in late 90s. Revisited it recently on a DVD. It is a nicely paced movie and the scenery is breathtaking. This movie is great fun. The credit for this goes to the wonderful stop-animation work of Ray Harryhausen. This is the last and finest example of his work. The best thing in this film was the showdown with Medusa. The scene is dark, creepy, and intense. I have re-watched the movie so many times and I still find it to be a great mythological fantasy film.The film has Kraken a giant monster, Calibos the satyr, blind witches, the devil's boatman, Cerberus - depicted with two heads instead of the usual three, mechanical owl, giant scorpions and finally Medusa, as a memorably striking n frightening creature. It also has Burgess Meredith (Rocky's trainer). Some beautiful cinematography by Ted Moore (7 James bond films, the golden voyage of sindbad, sindbad and the eye of the tiger).The karst area in El Torcal de Antequera, Spain appears in the visit to the Stygian witches. The Azure Window in Gozo, Malta, appears in the battle against the Kraken. I made my kids watch this few years before the remake. We all saw the remake in theatre n we all were disappointed.

You will never get bored, in fact, each scene is better than the previous.In my opinion, the highlight of the movie is the battle with Medusa. The scene is dark, creepy, and intense. The Medusa character is scary and I recall having nightmares as a kid after watching her. Her demise is memorable, stuff for legend. The other ""strong"" and most famous scene is the final confrontation. A scene filled with fantasy and a feeling of victory I can't describe.""Clash Of The Titans"" is a must see for everyone. For example, if you are a Horror fan you should watch ""The Exorcist"", and if you're a die hard fan of Sci-Fi or Fantasy, you NEED to watch ""Clash"".

I didn't blame him when he asphyxiated the king who condemned him and his mother out to sea. Yes, he worshiped Zeus, but his own pride and tyranny caused his downfall. And he cursed the son of Thetis(Maggie Smith) for causing endangered species in the land. I figured that in the ancient days there would be nudity. In the film, the parents should caution the kids about it. I liked the epic battles: Perseus slaying the gorgon Medusa, battling the giant scorpions, and riding Pegases; the winged horse. And that owl that was made into a robot, that was indeed the first to see updated technology for the gods. And the Krakken was the most awesome creature in the film that was taken down by the head of Madusa. Although there were slight changes from the books, the impact form the movie is just as exciting and I liked it. Very good fantasy movie, always a keeper to me. Rating 5 stars.",Clash of the Titans
48,FiendishDramaturgy,Dated but fantastic look into the recent past of the world.,6,12 January 2005,"As seems to be the trend with the dawning of each new decade, humans tend to look to the past in search of answers concerning their futures.Clash of the Titans is one such look back, from a position of entertainment rather than mythological accuracy. But we do not fault the film for that trait, as Clash of the Titans was a noted work in its day. It was nominated for 6 Saturn awards, and Berges Meredith won Best Supporting Actor in the Saturns. It was never considered some piece of fluff ""kid's movie.""Unfortunately, with the development of better imaging technology, this movie is showing a great deal of age. It is dated tremendously and does contain a few undesired anachronisms. The stop-motion treatment of the fantastical creatures seems almost unwatchable compared to today's CGI capabilities, and what seemed larger than life a scant 25 years ago, now seems diminished and uninspired by today's epic standards.I daresay that were this attempt redone today, it would have a much larger, grander, solid feel to it something reminiscent of a mini-Lord of the Rings saga. I originally bought this movie because I was on a Maggie Smith (as Thetis, here) kick and bought everything I could find in which she had even the most minute part. It wasn't the first time I had seen the Clash of the Titans, but it was the first time I had seen it as an adult. I must say that I'm glad I made this purchase. It's not a bad choice for an uneventful Sunday or any rainy evening.It rates a 6.4/10 from...the Fiend :.",Clash of the Titans
49,hellraiser7,Of Myths and Monsters,9,26 January 2019,"I love Greek Mythology in a way it's somewhat the Bible of the fantasy genre because without it wouldn't exist at all. There are many reasons why I love it, from the Gods, Monsters, the world it presents, but I'd have to say it's more in the stories of adventure on ordinary people that have faced and overcome challenge that we're beyond their ordinary existence and become more of what they are.This is another one of my favorite fantasy films and my second favorite Ray Harryhausen film. It's also another childhood gem of mine as it help me introduce and get me into Greek Mythology.Sure, this was released in the 80's with the effects it had but that to me isn't a bad thing because it gives the film a throwback feels as it not just helped contributed to the fantasy genre that came back strong and in full force in that decade but brought back something sorely missing. It's not a perfect representation of Greek Mythology (not a lot of films and TV series ever really are let's face it it's hard to do long ago legends justice) but I feel it really is one of the best in my book and still is as it delivers on part of what Greek Myth should be fascinating and fun.I like the production value does a good job in bring back a time long gone, from what you see it almost makes you believe that Gods, Monsters, and Magic once existed or could have existed. Really love the orchestrate music score, as it has one of my favorite themes of all time; it really fits the nature of the film as it just sings big legendary adventure.The characters Perseus (Harry Hamlin) and Andromeda (Judi Bowker) they look the roles and they serve their functions, you can't expect much from characters in Greek Myth as most are two dimensional. I do like some of the other cast members that play the roles well like one of my favorite actors Burgess Meredith whom is Ammon kind of the Earth father figure for Perseus much is really like how he guides and supports Perseus on his journey, he's also kind of funny as he has a bit of humor.The Gods are also good and consist of a surprising good acting ensemble. Though some would complain that most didn't really have much but in most Greek Myth story they at times were background players so you can't expect too much from them.Laurence Oliver is solid as Zeus whom is of course Perseus otherworldly father figure, he's true to the character as he's exercises aggressive authority along with kindness and helpfulness when necessary. Really like how in his Olympus pad he has this collection of toy figures, which of course represent all the mortals of earth, it's kind of a funny and interesting thought that this is part of how Gods watch over us and have a slight hand in our fates.Maggie Smith is also good as the goddess Thetis whom is a bit of an unlikeable b.... whom causes some hinderance in Perseus journey all because she can't admit toward bad parenting with her son Calabos, I heard of holding a grudge but man she really went the extra mile.But of course, in this film we're hear for the adventure and most importantly the monsters and they don't disappoint. The action is solid, the sword play is well choigraphed, really loved it whenever they fought the monsters each of the moves were on the mark with the stop motion effects make you really believe they are fighting actual monsters.I really love the designs of each of the monsters and the stop motion effects. I honestly don't care if they seem dated to anyone, I take this over crappy CGI anytime. Anyway, I really like the monster models their all memorable, and of course the stop motion is top notch as usual, not just does Ray know how to get movements down but also just the behavior of the creatures. From the giant scorpions, the Dylopos (two headed dog), Pegasus, though of course two of my favorites and the highlights of the film for me are Calabos, Medusa and Kraken.Calabos is a pretty good suppordinate villain, not much to say for his persona as he's sort of the typical cruel and vain type. By his nature this guy is just an extra obstacle for Perseus. Really like the design of him as he's pretty much a mutant, whom seems to be a fusion of a lot of animals, which makes sense and is sort of a poetic justice for his character as he exercised cruelty toward the creatures of nature and man.The Medusa she was creepy looking as she is a reptilian humanoid and she is a formattable opponent. I'll always remember that raddle which always sent chills, letting you know she's is never far away. Really like the action sequence with her as it's one of my favorite one on one battles and sequences of suspense in my book. It's a unique one on one because it's not heavily action oriented but a stealth action sequence. I was just on the edge of my seat hoping one of the arrows Medusa let's loose doesn't hit him, but also that Perseus doesn't dare look. Another part of the suspense is wondering how the heck Perseus will be able to defeat the Medusa if he can't see her. Really like how it's done showing how wits are one's best weapon.And of course, there is the Kraken which I'll admit is a unique and interesting version of the monster. The Kraken is a giant squid but her it's looks more like a crossbreed amphibious ape. Though like the Kraken it does have multiple appendages though instead of them being tentacles their four big arms. I'll admit looking at that Kraken when I was a kid made me nervous and made me never want to go near the ocean for a while.Clash of the Titans is a big legendary adventure with big fun.Rating: 3 and a half stars",Clash of the Titans
50,elshikh4,Jason Wins !,5,24 June 2014,"I've always asked; why visual effects master Ray Harryhausen regarded (Jason and the Argonauts - 1963) as his best movie, while he did many movies after it, and in more modern years? But watching next movies for him, like (Clash of the Titans - 1981), kind of allowed me the answer.If you read Harryhausen's biography, you'd discover that (Clash..) was his long-awaited chance, where a big Hollywood studio finally gave him the green-light to make a blockbuster, with name actors, and an expanded effects budget. However, it didn't eventually live up to the expectations of that, or the description of its poster ""An Epic Entertainment Spectacular""!As for the list of stars on that poster, let me flame up with rage. Despite having main title billing, Ursula Andress has only one line to say. Knowing that MGM increased the budget to hire him, Sir Laurence Olivier was awful as Zeus, with senseless performance, and some of the dullest lines to say. Harry Hamlin as Perseus was wrong. As a physique, he suited anyone but a Greek hero who fights all the terrifying legendary monsters. And as an actor, he was the interpretation of ""Flat""!Generally, the whole cast was somnambulist, doing a perfectly wooden performance (Where was the newly born Razzie for God's sake?!!). You can blame the director, the actors, but I have to mainly accuse the script. There is none in the first place. What I saw was fighting sequences, thinly tied together, with pale excuses of dialogue scenes, of which didn't have the least attention, touching situations, or any interesting character. It didn't have a relief to spread some needed vitality either, and if the character of Ammon was it; then this was deadly poor!Speaking about the script's sins, I must refer to the ugly climax. In moments like these, and after facing many mighty opponents through hard battles, it's so unfair, rather shameful, to crown all of that, with a joke of a scene, where the hero doesn't have to fight, but just runs the Medusa's eyes, and ending the so-called, or so cold, climactic fight, in 3 seconds!The direction was bland, and as static as the little statues that Zues used. Re-watch the scene in which Zeus sends Perseus the helmet, the sword, and the shield to understand this director's method in destroying magic on-screen!Bubo, the ""mechanical"" owl of Athena, was annoying, totally useless, and such an unforgivable dissonance in the movie's fantasy. Seemingly, it was introduced to capitalize on the popularity of R2-D2 from (Star Wars - 1977). And it obtained further silliness, when it was drawn above everyone and everything on one poster, while having no role and no logic!Although it's notable for its stop-motion special effects, with plenty of monsters includes: Forest Scorpions, the Kraken sea monster, Dioskilos; the two-headed dog, the Gorgon Medusa, and Calibos; Lord of the Marsh--it's below Harryhausen's achievements in movies like (Jason and the Argonauts). For me, the long fight of the 7 skeletons in (Jason..), which took over 4 months to complete, meritoriously beats nearly all the fights of (Clash..); where you can see, in a rare precedent for Harryhausen, the contrast between the studio's lighting on the Forest Scorpions, and the location's lower lighting on the actors!Let alone, that in the 1970s end, many milestones in the visual effects' filed were made; such as (Star Wars - 1977), (Superman - 1978), and (Alien - 1979) which all won Oscars for visual effects, while (Clash..) wasn't nominated. Compare the flying of Pegasus, here, to the one of Superman, 3 years earlier, to know the difference between a technique that got old, and another recent one; more developed and less fake.For these reasons, stop-motion animation became ""dated"", hence Harryhausen failed to find funding for his planned sequel (Force of the Trojans), which caused him to retire from filmmaking at the age of 61 (he died yet at the age of 93 in 2013).Pros: Yes, Burgess Meredith wasn't effective as a relief or sidekick, and mostly was brought to use his popularity as the hero's trainer in (Rocky - 1976) and (Rocky II - 1979), but as an actor, he was the sole one who gave a hoot, being truly ""human"" among all the stiff gods! For me as a kid, in the 1980s, the Gorgon Medusa proved to be powerfully horrific, and I still deem its sequence as the movie's most impressive effort.Answering my first question; you may think that Harryhausen considered (Jason..) his best because Columbia booked it as a single feature in many ""A"" theatres, unlike his previous movies which used to be shown as part of double features in ""B"" theatres. But I think compared to his next movies, especially (Clash..), (Jason..) wins in terms of having top visual effects, better plot, and less awful acting. Ironically, (Jason..) was a box office disappointment at the time of its release, while (Clash..) grossed $41 million at the North American box office, to be the 11th highest grossing film of the year (Did nudity play a role in that?!).Finally, it's fun. Sullen, not dazzling, or so exciting, but can satisfy your kids, if they aren't accustomed to cooler visual effects, and don't mind some bad writing and acting. Otherwise, it exclusively fits the kid in you; who has watched it at the time of its release. In this connection, I hated it when some user said: ""Can you honestly imagine the Medusa sequence being done any better with some computer program??!!"". Ahh, this is exactly what I call ""the nostalgia nonsense""!",Clash of the Titans
51,thinker1691,""" You have done well, Your Image will stay in the sky for all of Eternity """,10,3 August 2010,"The Greek Gods are the foundation of much of our world mythology. Learning of their contribution to our modern world is not surprising as we have much to thank them for. Here is an excellent movie adaption of the Greek legends. It is called "" Clash of the Titans "" and is one of the finest films ever made. It's true, it must compare with the newer version, but if one enjoys the special effects and the excellent cast, it seems a worthy offering. In this movie we have the legendary hero Perseus (Harry Hamil) who is born the son of mighty Zeus (Laurence Olivier), cast ashore on a distant land where he must seek out his true destiny. There, he is helped by Ammon (Burgess Meredith) and Thallo (Tim Pigott-Smith) to win the hand of the beautiful Andromeda (Judi Bowker). With a bevy of British actresses like Claire Bloom, Maggie Smith, Ursula Andress and Siân Phillips, the movie carries the Olympic story well. Ray Harryhausen produced this film and added the stop-action sequences he is so famous for and as a result has created a Classic for all time. School students of many ages and grades are sure to remember this fabulous myth for generations to come. *****",Clash of the Titans
52,freemantle_uk,A fun fantasy film,7,2 June 2013,"When I was younger I was really into Greek mythology, so I have a little bit of soft spot for films set in Ancient Greece. The original Clash of the Titans is considered one of the highlights in sub-genre in the fantasy genre.The Gods of Mount Olympus are worshipped in many cities. Zeus (Laurence Olivier) rules the Gods and his word and judgement is final: but he is biased towards his own children, including Perseus (Harry Hamlin). But that does not mean the Gods cannot play power games with each as Perseus ends up on a quest to protect the beautiful Princess Andromeda (Judi Bowker) and the city of Joppa from a curse placed upon them from the vengeful goddess Thetis (Maggie Smith).One of the big highlights is the stop-motion effects by the great Ray Harryhausen. Of course they are dated by today's standards, but Harryhausen was a master of his craft and there is a wonderful amount of detail in some very inventive creature designs. They is just a charm to them and the action as a hold still up today, particularly the fights with Calibos (which also had a good make-up job) and the two-headed wolf. It is refreshing in an age of CGI to have older films that physique to them. But some of the old blue screen effects, particularly the flooding of Argos has not aged well and the wave looks terrible.Clash of the Titans is fun fantasy experience for people who enjoys Greek mythology. Some of the most fun aspects for people enjoy the mythology is the interplay between the Gods and how they try and one up each other or act spitefully, using mortals are pawns and playthings to their whims. The Gods were basically a dysfunctional family. There are of course liberties to the legends, this isn't Excalibur which was a very loyal adaptation to Arthurian legends which was released in the same year.The Gods were played by a big name actors, Olivier, Smith and Ursula Andress being some of the most recognisable. Smith was the strongest presence out of them all as she serfs the antagonistic role and you can feel her vengeful side throughout. Out of the human cast Hamlin was a solid lead and he gave a decent performance, but Bowker, whilst very pretty was a little stiff in her delivery.The problem with Clash of the Titans is the writing as it very episodic. We see the characters go on a number of mini-quests during their mission. We see Perseus go on a mission to fight Calibos, then go on a quest to find the Stygian Witches which leads him on a mission to defeat Medusa. There was no truly overarching storyline. Nor are the human characters particularly well written: they does not seem to be much in the way of character development. They do not change much or nor do we get to know much about them, particularly the rest of Perseus' troop who we have are meant to have an emotional connection to (particular to Tim Pigott-Smith's character) but we do not get to know much about them. The final problem is Bubo, a mechanical owl which just felt out really out of place in a film about Greek mythology. They is a kitsch value to him and was well designed ,but why is a robot owl in this film? As a film Clash of the Titans is the closest we are going to get to a sequel to Jason and the Argonauts (a film that felt like it was lining up for a sequel). It is a solid piece of fantasy entertainment that should be praised for its special effects.",Clash of the Titans
53,MaxBorg89,Mythology extravaganza,7,24 April 2010,"It is quite remarkable that in this age of CGI, the stop-motion creations of Ray Harryhausen remain a charming, if quite dated sight. This is none more evident than in the mythology-based features he produced and created the visual effects for. Which is why Clash of the Titans, though directed by Desmond Davis, is commonly (and justly) attributed to Harryhausen.Loosely based on the myth of Perseus (played by future L.A. Law star Harry Hamlin), the film depicts the hero's struggles against many supernatural beings to save the beautiful Andromeda (Judi Bowker). Pulling the strings is the goddess Thetis (Maggie Smith), who explicitly disobeys the orders of Zeus (Laurence Olivier) for personal reasons. Luckily, Perseus gets some help in the shape of a mentor (Burgess Meredith), a winged horse named Pegasus and a mechanical owl called Bubo...Yes, the owl is nowhere to be found in the Greek myths, but then again, neither is the Kraken, one of the monsters the protagonist has to defeat. This is, of course, totally acceptable because Clash of the Titans never intended to please mythology scholars. Instead, it sets out to be an exciting ride, involving great adventures, dangers and a little romance.Inevitably, what worked back in 1981 doesn't always translate as well more than two decades later. Impressive as they may be (Medusa deserves a special mention), Harryhausen's creatures pale next to ILM's achievements in Raiders of the Lost Ark, which was released the same year, and Bubo really is a bit ridiculous with his R2-D2 sound effects (though the makers of the film claim that was an unfortunate coincidence). As for the acting, only Olivier and Smith (and, to a lesser extent, Meredith) provide what can be called solid thesping: it is painfully obvious that the likes of Hamlin, Boker and Ursula Andress were cast for their looks rather than their talent.Nevertheless, one thing the movie never forgets is to be fun, even it if does veer close to extreme camp at times. But hey, no one ever really expected a mythology-based action film to deal with major issues and have a compelling dramatic core, right? This is a cheap yet charming adventure, and should not be viewed as anything else.",Clash of the Titans
54,barnabyrudge,"Enjoyable, slightly childish fantasy based on the Greek myth of Perseus and Andromeda.",5,14 July 2007,"Greek mythology is full of stories of extraordinary heroism and romance, thrilling danger, and weird and wonderful creatures. It is hardly surprising that movie-makers are able to find interesting potential for big screen fantasy films from such material. Indeed, the only surprise is how few Greek myths have actually been adapted into movies over the years. The Hercules story has been done to death, admittedly, and who could forget Jason And The Argonauts? But many of the other well-known Greek myths haven't yet been seized upon by producers, writers and directors. Clash Of The Titans is a reasonably enjoyable, somewhat over-acted entry in the mythology/fantasy stakes which takes its inspiration from the myth of Perseus and Andromeda. The film tells its story with almost childish simplicity, but there's certainly a level of innocent fun to be gleaned from viewing it.Princess Andromeda (Judi Bowker) is promised as the future wife of Calibos (Neil McCarthy). Calibos is the son of the Goddess Thetis (Maggie Smith) who lives on Mount Olympus with all the other deities. When Thetis falls out with the supreme God, Zeus (Laurence Olivier), the latter transforms Calibos into a fearsomely ugly and deformed monster. Angered at this, Thetis threatens to unleash a terrible beast called the Kraken upon the world unless Andromeda is offered as a sacrifice to the creature. A young hero named Perseus (Harry Hamlin) - spared death by Zeus when he was just a baby - is called upon to rescue the princess. His quest is virtually impossible, and involves him surviving various tests and challenges if he is to succeed. Amongst other things, he must capture the flying horse Pegasus; solve an impossible riddle set by Andromeda's mother Cassiopeia (Sian Phillips); face the terrifying Stygian witches; sever the head of the hideous gorgon Medusa without getting himself turned to stone; fight against the monstrous Calibos; and somehow defeat the gigantic Kraken before it devours poor Andromeda. With great courage, Perseus sets about completing the many tasks appointed to him - but every moment he loses completing the challenges brings Andromeda closer to her horrible sacrifice. Will Perseus be able to reach her in time?Clash Of The Titans is one of those films that bears a degree of nostalgic value for anyone who saw it as a child. If your first viewing of the film is as an adult, it is unlikely to make much of an impression; but there is something appealing about its plasticine monsters and diverse adventures for the younger crowd. Hamlin is remarkable stilted as Perseus, but Bowker looks appropriately virginal as Andromeda - the supporting characters are portrayed by a roster of big stars in extended cameos, ranging from the deliciously hammy Olivier (as Zeus) to the charismatic Burgess Meredith (as a wise playwright who gives Perseus a helping hand). The likes of Ursula Andress, Claire Bloom, Flora Robson, Maggie Smith and Jack Gwillim provide amusing performances as various gods, goddesses and monsters. Ray Harryhausen's stop-motion creature effects are entertaining as always, even if they seem a little jerky for a film made in 1981 (the post-Star Wars years, where the nature of special effects had changed considerably). Photographically the film is a bit murky, and director Desmond Davis presents it all in a rather by-the-numbers fashion. However, Clash Of The Titans is a passable fantasy flick on the whole, and definitely a good choice if you need to keep the kids quiet.",Clash of the Titans

56,3xHCCH,A Classic Revisited in Preparation for the New One Coming,6,1 April 2010,"To prepare myself for the showing of the new ""Clash of the Titans"", I decided to re-view the 1981 original starring Harry Hamlin as Perseus, and Laurence Olivier as Zeus.""Clash of the Titans"" follows the story of the hero Perseus, his love Andromeda, and his adventures with the Gorgon Medusa and the last Titan called Kraken. To bring this mythic story to life, stop motion animation by Ray Harryhausen was utilized for the ""mythologicals"", interacting with human and ""god"" characters.I have fond memories of this film as I was able to watch this original on the big screen when it was first released. I have a distinct recollection that this was the very first movie review I had ever written. And now that I had seen it again today, I also recalled my observations in that first review.Then, as with now, the special effects and animation looked a bit dated. By 1981, we already had the Star Wars and Superman movies. Stop-motion simply has that quality that made this movie look like something from the 60s, or the 50s even.The flying seagull in the opening credits looked badly done. Perseus' hair did not move at all when he was riding Pegasus in the air. The deformed prince Calibos was unevenly rendered. The 2-headed dog Diokilos (should have been 3-headed, isn't it?) looked awkward. The main monster Kraken itself fails to inspire terror in the audience because of its obviously plastic body. The robotic owl Bubo is so out of place in the mythic setting, and obviously inspired by Star Wars' R2D2.Those things said, however, the best scene is still owned by a Harryhausen creation. The scene where Perseus battles Medusa is the best in the entire film. It was tense, exciting, and scary. The Medusa creature is something else with its original interpretation as a half-serpent. The stop-motion animation of this character was really first notch, as it crawled and was a crack archer! Classic scene.I have not read about the new film if it would copy the story of this entire movie. Of course, by now, the levels of CG animation and 3D rendering is off the charts. There are a lot of expectations as we await the showing of the new film. While this campy older film had hammy acting and dated effects, the story was still interesting enough to follow and enjoy. Let's see if the new film will maintain the heart of the story, as it improves the visual aspects.",Clash of the Titans

I can't tell you how many times I've seen the battles with Medusa, Calibos, and the Kraken. However, it was only recently that I went back and watched it start to finish. The first act is a little slower, as it turns out. However, once the quest begins, it's non stop fantasy action. Of course, the animation is legendary, with some great character designs. Overall, I have no real criticisms other than the slow start. And be sure not to let the deviations from traditional mythology spoil the fun. That would just be wrong.",Clash of the Titans
58,slokes,Classical Gas Pass,2,24 January 2006,"Stodgy, overlong, and muddy, ""Clash Of The Titans"" exists and is celebrated by its admirers as the last cinematic platform for special-effects wizard Ray Harryhausen. Such loyalty doesn't obscure the fact, more commonly noted in today's CGI age but true in 1981, too, that special effects need to serve an interesting story to be worth seeing at all.""Clash"" isn't interesting. It isn't even coherent. An angry Greek guy stands on a coastline, waves splashing extras as he chews the scenery and exposes his fillings while decrying his daughter's pregnant condition. To bury his shame, he sticks her and her son in a coffin and throws them into the ocean, which carries them to a magical isle where the boy, Perseus, grows into future ""L.A. Law"" star Harry Hamlin in his early beefcake days. Meanwhile, in an all-white space meant to be Olympus but more like a dentist's waiting room, a cross Zeus played by Lawrence Olivier decides to punish the father's murderous crime by, well, by destroying the father's city and murdering his subjects.""Release the crappin'!"" Zeus cries out.Actually, that's kraken, a sea creature not part of Greek lore but an early chance for Harryhausen to strut his stuff.Some movies live on because they are good. ""Clash Of The Titans"" seems to survive instead on nostalgia, for the Harryhausen aesthetic of Sinbad and Jason and claymation stop-action fight scenes with skeletons when such effects had to be earned with something more than a press of a button. It probably helps to have been young and impressionable when the film came out, geared as it is to a juvenile audience with a robotic owl clearly modeled on that classic Greek demigod R2-D2.But the action scenes are not terribly gripping; even the Medusa scene praised by many here plays too choppy and inert. There's no interest in the characters; though Hamlin and co-star Judi Bowker are pretty to look at, they are given no more to do than recite threadbare lines with minimal emotion. The gods bicker and utter various profundities, with Olivier looking like he's being filmed between proctology exams and most of the other Olympians standing around looking concerned. Like Jamie Farr in ""Scrooged"" and Phil Silvers in ""The Cheap Detective"" Ursula Andress as Aphrodite has star billing and one line of dialogue. Maggie Smith pines for a mutant goat boy while Claire Bloom pines for the days she and Sir Larry worked on ""Richard III.""Either director Desmond Davis and screenwriter Beverley Cross were inept, or else they were under strict orders from producer Harryhausen not to do anything interesting that would distract from his effects work. The sets are bare, the outfits plain (togas over jogging shorts), and the secondary characters exist largely to be killed off by Harryhausen's monsters or else cheer when the heroes do something we are supposed to be excited by. Burgess Meredith plays up his wizened-but-puckish persona as a playwright who helps Perseus capture the winged horse Pegasus, then both coot and steed melt into the background.Greek myth stories have a lot of potential to entertain. They are the oldest surviving form of Western story, after all, and have been passed on a couple dozen centuries already at least, however updated and distorted. ""Clash Of The Titans"" could have been a nice popcorn return to civilization's colorfully chaotic roots; instead it dodders and pontificates, giving us a few peaks here and there at something greater behind its limp façade, but never coming close to delivering anything worthwhile.",Clash of the Titans
59,dworldeater,Clash Of The Titans 81' rules! Unleash the Kraken on the haters!,10,22 December 2015,"Clash Of The Titans comes from a special magic place in time, the early 1980's. Before cgi ruled the cinematic world, film makers and their special f/x crews relied on craftsmanship and creativity to get their fantastical visions on the screen. Ray Harryhausen's hard work and intense imagination bring the Greek mythology to life and it is a sight to behold. Of course, the special visual f/x are a major part of the film, but Desmond Davis directed this and did a fine job in keeping this cohesive and exciting. The film itself looks great, is well acted and sounds great with the uplifting and triumphant score by Laurence Rosenthal. Harry Hamlin is excellent as hero Perseus and does a great job in carrying the film. Judi Bowker is the gorgeous Princess Andromeda and love interest for hero and super stud Perseus. I'm sure most guys in Perseus place would have little problem rising to the occasion to fight the forces of evil to gain the favor of our super hot princess. Most dudes would die trying, which is why Perseus is the man. The rest of the support cast(mostly British) is great also. Plus Burgess Merideth, Ursula Andress and most importantly Laurence Oliver brings down the thunder as Zeus. The early 80's were a great time for movies like this and Clash Of The Titans has long been a favorite of mine since I was a kid.

It is called the clash of the Titans after all, but you don't really get to see their fight with any passion and the tool of their clash is a weak ass named Perseus, played by Harry Hamlin who has no presence as a hero.
Add to that a gimmicky Owl that must surely have been put in for the kids and it's just not the standard I expect anymore.Maggie Smith shines as ever, among a cast of fairly well known names, but she seems to stand alone in her performance.The special effects are obviously dated and if you compare it to 'Star Wars' made 4 years earlier, they really do stand out as being very poor, but the charm of the film is the contribution by Ray Harry Hausen, whose claymation figurines will go down in legend. They are cheesey, but that is their appeal. Ray's creations have a cult following thanks to his work on 'Jason & The Argonauts' and 'Sinbad' and rightly so, because at their time they were brilliant. They are only appropriate though in this film, because of that cult status.It's still a fairly good film to watch, but with Perseus being so wet, you don't really feel that you are getting the proper epic that you tuned in for.",Clash of the Titans

Harryhausen's incredible effects work is still amazing to watch, with Medusa still being a terrifying stand-out.

A very young Harry Hamlin as Perseus is on a quest to rescue his beloved Andromeda (played by a very pretty Judy Bowker). Perseus must subdue Pegasus, defeat Medusa (easily the best scene in the movie), fight the Kraken, a very large sea monster, and deal with a deformed villain who throws many obstacles in our hero's path. Harryhausen's animation cannot be faulted, but scenes that involve live actors who are also portrayed in part as animated characters abruptly take us out of the fantasy. Of course, this was long before the smooth CGI of today. A mechanical owl is cute, but clearly was intended to be Perseus' R2D2. Worth a watch mainly for film historians and completists.

65,nycritic,The Power of Myth? Not Quite.,4,24 April 2006,"If it weren't the kind of movie that it is -- the kind that only asks you to One Thing: turn your thinking brain on Power Save and enjoy the eye candy and now-cheesy visuals courtesy of Ray Harryhausen -- CLASH OF THE TITANS would be probably unbearable on many different levels. Greek mythology gets a watered down, STAR WARS treatment with the genuine luster of the earlier film, and the whole thing is a silly mess that works if you're reading Edith Hamilton, but falls flat on its face otherwise. The Olympians are reduced to older Shakespearean actors who arch their eyebrows and stand still while plotting the fates of the Mortals (and not a single one looks like they could convince as the Gods that they represent -- has Zeus looked more frail and sickly, for example? This is one role Olivier does not fill even competently.). The claymation animatronics look, at the time of its release, over forty years past its prime -- cartoons would have done a better job at this. Plot holes as big as Texas abound: if the blood of the Medusa is so poisonous and cursed that a single drop can generate scorpions that grow to enormous size, how come when Perseus slays her (okay, I meant ""chops her head clean off""), causing a thick goo of what seems to be Ragu to spill out of her neck and onto the floor, does it not turn into anything other than a pool of brightly colored fake blood? Maybe it's lazy plotting -- later, Kalibos pops into the scene and pierces the bag where her head is and what do you know, out comes a trickle of Ragu and the magic of Harryhausen does its work: three giant scorpions appear. In any case, it really is no use to ask questions since really, this is to mythology what Ed Wood is to high art. None of the actors other than Harry Hamlin (who looks great in a skirt) has little more to do than to say their lines and be done with it, the Kraken is a holdover from Norse mythology, Bubo is a lame rip-off of R2-D2, the three witches are from ""MacBeth"", and Andromeda really needs to find a better way to get married, because all this ho-hum about a curse and then a riddle and being carried off to Pinewood Studios by a claymation buzzard is not working.",Clash of the Titans
66,breakdownthatfilm-blogspot-com,Possibly a template for Disney's Hercules?,7,1 July 2014,"Every culture has their own legendary stories or epics. The most common of cultures that writers and filmmakers look at are from early Roman and Greek mythology. There's something about the ancestry of man at that time, in that location, of which intrigues peoples. It could be as complex as the pagan beliefs and laws or as simple as the way clothing was worn. The reasoning behind the gravitation towards this culture is less clear than the subject at hand itself (which is quite honestly weird). Nevertheless, there have been adaptations to the screen before this one based on this topic, but this particular adventure film is different for a number of reasons. It's still not perfect but is hard not to like.Viewers will be introduced to Perseus (Harry Hamlin), an abandoned boy who is saved by Zeus, king of the gods. Apparently, Perseus is also the son of Zeus, which kind of puts the story of Hercules into question. As Perseus grows up, Zeus informs him of his journey that'll make him great and forever make him a staple in history. The weird thing is, Perseus just accepts this. Obviously, the belief of signs and omens were highly regarded back then, but not even a hint of doubt comes into his mind. You know this could all be a trick Perseus? Besides, before being told about his possible future, Perseus lives the life of luxury as it was. What if he was lazy and decided that he didn't feel a need to take on this opportunity that the Gods presented to him? Then what?There are also several other little things that clearly were not verified in the screenplay that Beverly Cross wrote. Cross was also behind the more popular Jason and the Argonauts (1963). This is not to say that all of the writing doesn't make sense, it just contains strange truths that aren't confirmed until after the claim is made. The story does however have good pacing and keeps the spirit of adventure and discovery high. Surprisingly there are also a couple of parallels that can be drawn to Disney's Hercules (1997). Some being that Hercules and Perseus fight giant creatures, ride a flying horse named Pegasus, were the son of Zeus and most visible are the three blind witches that look into an all seeing eye (and they sound like them from Hercules (1997) too!). Did Disney take inspiration from this movie? The cast is another element to make note of - some went on to be known for other roles or were already known, while others disappeared completely. The completely vanished group belongs to the main stars, Harry Hamlin and his love interest played by Judi Bowker. These two do contain a filmography history but didn't bother go on to anything big even though this movie performed well. But the section of cast that did flourish or was already well known were Maggie Smith (who plays in the Harry Potter series), Ursula Andress (she didn't move on far but was known for her 007 roles) and Burgess Meredith (from the Rocky series). However, these are not the only stars on the screen. One of the key highlights to the film is effects master Ray Harryhausen's creature stop-motion animation. Of course by today's standards it seems out of date but that's because of the limited technology at the time. In fact, there's a good portion of the film that still looks rather decent as old as it is. The most memorable scene of the film would be the battle of Perseus Vs Medusa. My favorite was Bubo the mechanical Owl. As Mr. Harryhausen's last film, it shows he went all out in effort to impress. Harryhausen also was the guy behind the effects in Jason and the Argonauts (1963). Timothy Gee, although doesn't have a big resume for films, effectively edited the film so that it cuts between live- action and stop-motion without losing the illusion. Finally, I was surprised in Laurence Rosenthal's score. For a composer who spent most of his time doing TV music, is not half bad. It had a theme to Perseus and it sounded very heroic. It wasn't memorable but it did match the mood of the film easily. Watch more for nostalgic reasons if nothing else.It lacks clarity for certain truths and its main character seems to have no humanity for he just follows what the Gods say. But as a whole, the special effects, although now considered old, are still great to watch, it has a decent cast and it's a steady moving adventure.",Clash of the Titans
67,MartianOctocretr5,Mythological creatures with attitude issues,7,6 September 2006,"Greek gods send Perseus to rescue a princess in this old-fashioned sword and sandals fantasy loosely based on some characters from classic Mythology.Seems the princess is going to be sacrificed to a Kraken (a giant Leviathan monster) to placate an angry goddess. Perseus (Harry Hamlin) and the princess predictably fall in love, even before he sets out on his journey to find a way to save her. Myths and legends are introduced as the story progresses, as Perseus (and you) learn how to overcome the seemingly invincible monster.Wonderfully done with traditional stop-motion animation which makes the creatures look all the more bizarre, threatening, and evil. It's certainly primitive animation technology by today's standards, but more creative and fun, at least in the context of this movie. I love the creatures such as the three blind prophetesses who share an evil eye, the demonic Centaur, and best of all, the Medusa. When Perseus enters her lair along with two helmeted soldiers (whose faces you don't see), it's pretty obvious who's going to get it--but it's interesting to watch anyway. The fight with the scorpions is also presented in a clever manner.The ending drags a bit, and gives no surprises in its resolution. Overall, though, the film works well, and showcases this lost style of movie in an entertaining fashion. A good popcorn flick for a lazy weekend afternoon.",Clash of the Titans
68,coltras35,Classic Harryhausen extravaganza,10,17 August 2021,"Grand, glorious, wondrous and epic. Such words are used to describe a film that just takes you away to another time, a time of heroes and princesses, good vs evil, terrifying yet wondrous creatures, and if there such a film that fits this description it's Clash of the Titans (1981) epic tour de force, which in my opinion gets better with age.The story- Perseus, son of the god Zeus, sets out to win the love of the beautiful Andromeda. In order to do so he must first overcome the terrifying obstacles set in his path by the other gods on Mount
Olympus. He is set upon by witches, a monstrous two-headed dog, the Medusa of the Gorgon's head and finally the horrifying Kraken - a giant sea monster.Apart from the ingenious special effects of Ray Harryhausen ( sadly his last film), Clash of Titan's appeal is a strong cast, headed by Harry Hamlin, who is suitably stalwart as Perseus, Burgess Meredith is excellent as a oni-kenobi figure, and the Immortals (Laurence Olivier ,Claire Bloom, Maggie Smith And Ursula Andress) ooze a commanding presence and add drama to the Immortal politics. Judi Bowker (Black Beauty) is very pretty and looks quite the princess. The production design and locations are amazing. The music is suitably dreamy and fantastical.Some would say that Clash of the Titans lurks in the shadow of the classic Jason and the Argonauts, but I reckon they both compliment each other, though I do find Clash ... a little more appealing, it seems to be more larger than life, has a muscular plot, great action, and probably more monsters, which are the highlight of the film. Kalibos ( always found him mean and menacing - the Marsh sequence is eerie), Bubo, Charon, Dioskilos ( two-headed dog), Pegasus, Scorpions( that action sequence where Perseus and his men fight these giant nuisances is well-staged) and Vulture all, in true Harryhausen fashion, come to life, but, of course, the two iconic scenes feature Medusa and Kraken - the former creature is one Harryhausen's best inventions, its rather stiff but slithery movement and scary looks adds to the tension in her abode where Perseus seeks to slain her. She's one eerie creature, whose death throes is so realistic and dramatic. As for Kraken, the monster - based on Harryhausen's earlier creature Emir - is left for the finale in a scene that harks back to a time when heroes were heroes; this symbolises probably one of the last of the old fashioned heroic scenes. The appearance of the Kraken is beautifully dramatic, something that CGI fails to achieve, and it's movement is so lifelike- the winged horse framed in the same sequence is simply magical.All in all, Clash of the titans is a gem that has the power to spellbound, regardless of age. Sure the FX can be a little jerky, or, as some say dated, but the clue is in the year it was made. The FX here doesn't come out from a computer - it's handcrafted by a legend, who painstakingly took months to create what you see on the screen. The monsters appear real, yet menacing but at the same wondrous- I give this a ten for sheer celluloid magic, sadly the kind you won't see again.",Clash of the Titans
69,rivertam26,Fantastically entertaining,8,1 March 2020,"I was raised on this film. I always thought it was so cool. Revisiting it so many years later I think I even appreciate it more. Besides the amazing effects the movie is unique and entertaining in the way it tells its story. It's been overly copied at this point from young adult series Percy Jackson which are pretty good to the abysmal reimaginings. Handsome Harry Hamlin stars as our hero as he battles everything from skeletons to giant scorpions, the kraken and most impressively Medusa. The movie is exciting and still holds up if a little cheesy.",Clash of the Titans
70,Maciste_Brother,Could have been so much more,8,25 January 2003,"I saw CLASH OF THE TITANS when it was released. This was during the massive explosion of science fiction movies after the success of Star Wars and other blockbusters of the late 1970s. The idea of a fantasy film taking place during ancient Greece was a refreshing from the glut of sci-fi films. But I wasn't too thrilled by COTT. I thought then as now that COTT is a misfire of sorts with some memorable moments, the one with the medusa being the film's stand-out scene. One of the most effective suspenseful scenes ever made. There are numerous scenes where the direction is clearly lacking. For example, when the Kraken surfaces and heads for the city at the beginning of the film, we see a series of shots that more or less has nothing to do with the moment. In fact we don't know what's going on. We see a God under water, a gate opening with something (the Kraken) coming out of it. Then Zeus crunches the little statue, which kills the man and then all hell breaks loose and we see people running but we don't know why. Then we see a series of stock footage shots of big waves, which are supposed to have been started by the Kraken but the waves look like standard waves, not an artificially created tsunami. And when the city is finally hit by the waves, we see people running around with their Adidas shorts under their togas.The cast is actually great but alas they have little to do. The scenes with the gods jump from one to the next without any narrative sense. One moment a city is destroyed, then we see Zeus punishing Calibos for killing almost all of the winged horses (save for Pegasus). Scenes jump from one to the next even though we still haven't figured out what exactly happened in the previous scene. The whole beginning is simply a series of stilted set-ups for the main story that never engages the viewer. The direction by Desmond Davis is, at times, quite poor and incoherent and convoluted when simplicity was in order, certainly when you consider that the film is based on timeless mythical characters we're very familiar with.The film is not a total lost. It is watchable (I've seen it countless of times) and some scenes are excellent here and there. The cast IS excellent (even if it's wasted) and the score by Laurence Rosenthal is the best thing in the whole film, giving life and character to the rather flat execution (I still have the vinyl LP I bought after seeing the film). And I don't mind Bubo, which a lot of people seem to hate. Personally, I'd rather watch CLASH OF THE TITANS than something like the THE FIFTH ELEMENT. But it still doesn't change the fact that CLASH OF THE TITANS is plagued by uneven direction, uneven FX, and a decidedly uneven story. It's a shame because the whole concept of the mythological story is filled with so much potential.(addendum: after viewing the remake...this film is a masterpiece...)",Clash of the Titans
71,Sirus_the_Virus,Interesting story but it's lacking something.,5,21 October 2009,"Clash of the Titans, to some, is considered a classic. You know what, I would probably agree with them if it wasn't for one little flaw. Don't look at me the wrong way for saying this. But the film's special effects are horrible. Now I have seen the film twice in my life. I know it was made in the 80's. But I am pretty sure there was better special effects in the 80's than this. Perhaps Twilight had better effects than this, but I won't go there.I liked the film's interesting plot. This movie would have it all if it wasn't for it's damn awful special effects. I am somewhat interested in Greek mythology, though I know it's all just a bunch of hooey. Hooey, that it a really stupid word. Anyways, it's interesting stuff.The guy who directed the recent Hulk movie is directing this. I have faith in that movie because Liam Neeson and Ralph Feinnes are in it. Also because special effects are usually mind blowing these days. This movie wouldn't be bad if it wasn't for it's horrible effects. I am sorry.Clash of the titans:**/****",Clash of the Titans
72,TheUnknown837-1,"It is also a testament to the discipline, as well as the talents, of special effects wizard Ray Harryhausen",9,7 December 2012,"""Clash of the Titans"" is the quintessential fantasy put on film. From start to finish, it is a delightfully entertaining little extravaganza packed full of alternate-reality spectacle and wonder. It is also a testament to the discipline, as well as the talents, of special effects wizard Ray Harryhausen, who is both at his most skillful and his most mature levels here. In most of his movies, it is his stop-motion animated creatures and worlds that draw people. Take, for example, ""Jason and the Argonauts,"" regarded as, I feel incorrectly, his best picture. Whenever I watch that picture, it is never for the thin characterizations and less-than-charismatic acting. Hence why Harryhausen's hydra, skeletons, and other weird and fantastic figures took center-stage consistently in that movie.However, even though ""Clash of the Titans"" contains probably twice as many monsters as ""Jason and the Argonauts,"" they actually play second-fiddle to the flesh-and-blood people. And the results are actually kind of refreshing. For not only is the screenplay just as interested in the character as in the monsters, but the people, both on earth and Mount Olympus, are interesting in their own small way. The creatures—which include Medusa the Gorgon, a mechanical owl built by the gods, a two-headed wolf, a giant sea monster, among others—are part of the fantastic world of Greek mythology, but it is Harry Hamlin, as Perseus, who runs away with the show.Hamlin, a better actor than often given credit for, is smart in the way he portrays Perseus. He goes not go for a dramatic, over-the-top performance; he realizes that he's not in a stage production of ""Hamlet."" He consciously underplays the performance, somehow getting off so much charisma and gusto without over-emoting as would be the tendency. Hamlin is instantly likable from the start, as he ought to be, and carries us through the fantastic journey to save the princess Andromeda (also well-played by Judi Bowker) from the vengeance of a jealous goddess. Hamlin and Bowker have a delightfully old-fashioned romance together on-film, one that does not go into too much detail, as too much detail would seem unnecessary. After all, this is a fantasy about what the Greeks imagined life before them, not a deep, philosophical study about the meaning of life. The other human performances are good in the context of a mythology film. After all, mythology usually never gave us much in the way of character backgrounds and personalities. The screenplay and actors realize this and make the best of it all. I particularly liked Burgess Meredith as the quirky, wise storyteller who helps explain the background and context to the audience as well as the other characters. And as for the people on Mount Olympus, well, what more could you want other than to see Laurence Olivier dominating the sets as Zeus? Olivier much more efficiently captures the sense of semi-tyranny and temperamental power than what we got from Niall MacGinnis in ""Jason the Argonauts.""But what is so special about ""Clash of the Titans"" is the way it whole-heartedly believes in its own world and the sense of spectacle and majesty it evokes. When we first hear Laurence Rosenthal's music at the opening, there is a spell-binding sense of majesty in ""Clash of the Titans."" Everything, even a simple landscape shot of Perseus and the other heroes riding on horseback against an early morning sky, has a spine-tingling sensation to it. And, despite the temptation that surely would have been ever-present during production, the movie does not condescend into self-parody. The only comic relief—and it is completely deliberate—is a mechanical owl named Bubo. Now questions have always risen whether Bubo or the ""Star Wars"" character R2-D2 came out first (""Clash of the Titans"" was released after ""Star Wars,"" but had been in production since the late 70s), but regardless, Bubo is insistently charming and funny: a klutzy little thing with a big 'heart,' I guess you could say. As soon as he falls from a tree branch in his introductory scene, he's won our hearts. And seeing him whipped down from his perch by a villain later in the film leaves us gasping. We like this little mechanical critter.The other creatures have their sense of majesty as well. The best of all being the Kraken, the sea monster sent to devour Andromeda. Harryhausen pulls all of his special effects skills together in this marvelous climax. And the scene takes its time padding out: the Kraken takes its time in its attack, menacing Andromeda and the people watching with snarls and lashes of its four powerful arms. It seems to be enjoying the panic it causes, and Rosenthal's music, heavy with trombones, punches our eardrums and raises our pulses.The special effects are overall very impressive, with only a few dreadful lapses. But none concern the stop-motion effects, only the rotoscope. The flat, quirky silhouetted bird we see playing beneath the opening credits is frighteningly amateur and furthermore, not even necessary. If the filmmakers were wise to enough to save an extra print of the footage, they would have been better just cutting it out and letting the audience fill in the blanks. A couple of shots from a scene where the Kraken demolishes a city, with optically tricked-in water pounding upon victims, also has a staged feeling to it.But those are small lapses. Most of the effects are absolutely brilliant—Harryhausen at his absolute pinnacle—and contribute to the movie's sense of wonder and spectacle. Now Harryhausen films have always been a part of my life, ever since childhood. My adoration has not fizzled over the years, even if weaknesses show through sometimes. But ""Clash of the Titans"" has aged astronomically well, and it is, as far as I am concerned, the very best film Harryhausen ever worked on. And again, his most disciplined, for he allows the people to take center-stage over his monsters.",Clash of the Titans
73,jeremycrimsonfox,A Great Epic,9,19 July 2020,"I first saw Clash of the Titans in high school, and I fell in love with it, as it was a great epic with amazing characters and special effects.This film tells the story of Perseus (played by Harry Hamlin), the son of Danae, a girl from Argos who was banished to the sea by her cruel father after it is found out the baby is also the son of Zeus (played by Lawrence Oliver), he grows up on the island of Seriphos. However, one day, he wakes up in Joppa's abandoned amphitheater, done by the sea goddess Thetis as retaliation for Zeus turning her son Calibos into a monster, hence beginning an epic adventure where he would face many dangers.This is a great masterpiece. The characters are likable and the story and action are good, but the one thing this movie excels in is special effects.

Watching this is not hard but if one wants to get critical, the magic comes into question. I watch to be entertained and this movie has good, pure motives. Made on the cheap, it paid for itself and was worth the price of a movie ticket. Furthermore, it was worth seeing more than once for the memorable scenes. The gods ruled everything and if you didn't believe in them you got your comeuppance. If you did, you got your destiny and if the gods argue, anything goes. Here, you get it all plus a delightful little fellow called Bubo who comes in handy. Sort of like a flying crystal ball in the shape of an owl, if you could understand this thing you had a good friend. I was surprised at the nudity that showed up in this movie. Interesting for the eighties but of course who would have known we are just getting started here. The actors had fun, made some money, special affects wowed us, there was a love story, a hero and a solid ending. Too bad they didn't sequel this. Have snack and tasty drink but nothing heavy especially when Medusa gets hers. Not appetizing but doable. By the way, the remake was disappointing but still captured your interest enough to go see it and from the producers/investors point of view made sense.

75,marcin_kukuczka,Great! Spectacular! Magnificent!,8,12 June 2004,"THE CLASH OF THE TITANS is one of the best films about mythology ever made. Its artistic features are noticeable at almost each scene, which makes watching it a real admiration of movie art and keeps your blood run faster throughout.Desmond Davies showed the story of Perseus and his love to Andromeda in a very memorable way. The film is not too scary, it is for everyone to see; the filming locations are spectacular (most scenes are filmed in Malta and Sicily); the music by Lawrence Rosenthal is unforgettable. Except for these factors, there are also a number of impressive moments and great celebrities. I particularly like the scenes of Andromeda's nightmares, when she visits a kingdom of marsh, being brought there by a vulture in a cage. Its creative imagery does make a perfect impact on the viewer. The moment of Perseus' visit to the three women-witches is also very memorable! In fact, few directors showed something like that in such an incredible way... And, probably, the most famous scene from this movie...Charon taking Perseus and his companions through the River Stix while Perseus is going to fight Meduze. This is one of the most thrilling scenes I have seen!Cast are also great! Judi Bowker, not very famous, but really innocent and beautiful as princess Andromeda; Harry Hamlin gives a memorable performance as Perseus; Sian Phillips, who is most famous for her role of Livia in a classical BBC mini series I CLAUDIUS (1976), also gives a very good performance (pity we get so little time with her). Finally, the great cinema stars play gods: Laurence Olivier as Zeus himself, and others including Ursula Andress, Claire Bloom, Maggie Smith. GREAT!!!This film is really worth seeing!

76,vip_ebriega,A classic piece of Harryhausen fantasy.,8,13 May 2008,"My Take: Fantastic special effects by the great Ray Harryhausen make for one magical, old-fashioned adventure.Fans of the great effects master Ray Harryhausen can't afford to miss CLASH OF THE TITANS, his last major work with the stop-motion special effects, which debuted in the famous B-movie THE BEAST FROM 20,000 FATHOMS and popularized in films like THE 7TH VOYAGE OF SINBAD and THE VALLEY OF GWANGI. In CLASH OF THE TITANS, Harryhausen takes up mythology monsters like the Kraken (a giant octopus-armed sea reptile), Medusa (the snake-haired hag) Pegasus (the winged-horse) and many others. Thanks to the grand special effects that remind us with its nostalgic feel, CLASH OF THE TITANS is a fun, old-fashioned adventure flick filled with great heroes, fine damsels, evil villains and the grand traditional elements of action, suspense and romance.The hero of the story is Perseus (TV star Harry Hamlin), who is saved by the great God Zeus (scene-chewing Laurence Olivier) out of pity. After being trained by Ammon (Burgess Meredith), who becomes his sidekick-of-sorts, he goes on a journey fighting a series of grotesque monsters, including the disfigured Calibos (Niel McCarthy, with a stop-motion animated double), and then wishing to marry the beautiful maiden Andromeda (Judi Bowker) after answering the riddle offered to him by Andromeda's mother Cassiopeia (Sian Phillips).The movies is incomplete without the great old-fashioned mixture of romance and adventure. Obviously inspired by the success of George Lucas' STAR WARS, CLASH OF THE TITANS aims to bring back the old ways of adventure pictures, complete with the heroes, women and villains, as well as the sidekicks of course. The chirping little mechanical owl called Bubo, obviously patterned to be a version of R2-D2, is appealing and often funny.Although the story is strong, with its grand tradition to Greek Mythology and its figures, the script is flawed with some cheesy dialog and its pacing is also slightly flawed; sagging a bit on the midsection. But the overall movie is still a great and enjoyable old-fashioned adventure, and Harryhausen's effects still delight, in a pre-CG sort of way. Sometimes, these effects have more heart than some CGI drone. For old time's sake, just pop in this minor classic, grab a bowl of popcorn and let the good old childhood memories come alive.

77,vitaleralphlouis,"A :LONG, LONG wait at Netflix.",8,5 June 2010,"In 1981 they still knew how to make good movies. In 2010 this kind of picture is reliably overblown, boring and stupid. I wouldn't waste 50 cents or 10 minutes on the new Clash of the Titans.The original offered a solid cast who knew how to act in a Greek mythology film. But the best thing was Ray Harryhausen's stop-motion animation. Today's CGI stuff just looks false and stupid in comparison to what the great ones were creating in the 1930's through 1990's.One important note that everyone else seems to have missed: The mechanical owl. It's painfully obvious that Star Wars R2D2 was an imitation of the owl character, actions, purpose and sound effects almost exactly the same.To rent this at Netflix, there was a 6 week wait. It's worth noting that the 2010 Clash of the Titans lasted less than 6 weeks in theaters. That's today's movies: instantly forgettable.",Clash of the Titans

Both films have young heroes destined for greatness (Hamlin), a princess in peril (Bowker), a bearded old man watching over him (Olivier), mechanical cohorts (Bubo the Owl/Robot), and a villain looking to destroy all that is good (McCarthy).  Check it out, they even had the Hildebrandt brothers (who designed the original ""Star Wars"" poster) design the original release poster for COTT.  Then again, ""Clash"" has it roots in Roman mythology, where there are such fearsome creatures as the Medusa, Calibos, the Kraken, the Stygian witches, and all manner of huge scorpions, two-headed dogs and other plagues of the gods to befall all who disobey them. There are more wonders still in Ray Harryhausen's stop-motion animation of the more fantastic of the creatures here.  True, it looks outdated when compared to what can be done nowadays, but it's vision enough for young children to watch and be swept up in the action of a long time ago....Besides, how young were you when you first watched ""Star Wars""?Eight stars.

79,aesgaard41,I Loved It !,10,1 March 2001,"It's nice to know that with all the different Herculeses running around that no one forgot Perseus (the great grandfather of Hercules as a matter of fact). While the creators took obvious liberties with the story, the special effects are stunning, some of Ray Harryhausen's best. Medusa is right dead on although the concept of her as a naga (snake-goddess) hit me out of left field. The visualization of Olympus and the gods on it was a boring and stagnant without any major grandeur. They're attired in white togas with no creative costuming what so ever and no glimpses of the other myriad gods of Olympus. Ursula Andress would not have been my choice for Aphrodite, but Susan Fleetwood resembles Isabella Rosselini of ""The Odyssey"" enough to pull off Athena, but kudos have to go to whoever got Sir Laurence Oliver to play Zeus. Even next to Roy Dotrice, John Rhys-Davies or perhaps Sean Connery, he is the only man who could give the role the command it deserves. More liberties were taken with Thetis as the wife of Poseidon,though, her presence forced into the story is only merely there to inflict the fateful curse. Harry Hamlin may not be an action star, but he does well in the role. Beautiful Judi Bowker makes for an entrancing Andromeda despite the trial she went through chained to a cliff at high tide. Burgess Meredith is whimsical and wise as the playwright who Perseus befriends, and Neil McCarthy emotes as best as he can as the new character Calibos inserted into the legend. The few things I can find fault with at all is the obvious overuse of previous footage whenever Perseus flies over Joppa. The tiny robotic owl Bubo is as charming as a big, stupid, purple dinosaur on PBS, but the images of Pegasus are as spectacular as you would expect. The images flying through the air again are foiled by the obvious overuse of stock footages and the telling scenes with stop-motion. Despite these few faults, this is a very enchanting fantasy and a very under-appreciated movie.",Clash of the Titans
80,ja_kitty_71,One of Ray Harryhausen's popular films,10,8 January 2008,"Clash of The Titans is one of my favorite films from special-effects wizard Ray Harryhausen, and it is also one of his last films in the 1980s. This film is also one of the last films to star Laurence Olivier; I have three of his Shakespeare films. And lastly I do study World Mythology as a hobby not just Greek but other countries too. There are five things I have found in the storyline, that differs from the original myths :1. In the original story, Acrisius wasn't jealous of Danae. An oracle warned Acrisius that Danae's son would someday kill him, so Acrisius shut Danae in a bronze room, away from all male company. However, Zeus conceived a passion for Danae, and came to her through the roof, in the form of a shower of gold that poured down into her lap; as a result she had a son, Perseus. When Acrisius discovered Perseus, he locked both mother and son in a chest, and set it adrift on the sea. The chest came ashore at Seriphus. After his great adventure of slaying Medusa, Perseus and Danae returned to Argos in search of his grandfather, but Acrisius had gone to Larissa. When Perseus arrived there, funeral games were being held and Perseus, being a great athlete, joined in. However, during the discus throwing an accident occurred. By chance the discus Perseus had thrown hit Acrisius and killed him; the prophecy had come true.2. In Mythology, Thetis wasn't a sea goddess, but one of the Nereids (sea nymphs) and also mother to the hero Achilles (not Calibos he is an original), whom she tried unsuccessfully to make immortal. She dipped the child in the river Styx holding him by the heel. All the parts that the river touched became invulnerable, but the heel remained dry. Achilles was later killed in the Trojan war.3. In Mythology, Pegasus the winged horse,was fathered by Poseidon with Medusa. When her head was cut of by the Greek hero Perseus, the horse sprang forth from her pregnant body. His galloping created the well Hippocrene on the Helicon (a mountain in Boeotia).4.The Kraken was not the name of a titan in Greek mythology, but a sea monster from Scandinavian mythology. And...5. In Mythology, Medusa was not a priestess; but she was a beautiful maiden. She desecrated Athena's temple (not Aphrodite's) by lying there with Poseidon. Outraged, Athena turned Medusa's hair into living snakes. I love the film's Princess Andromeda. This might seem strange to you guys, but I put her on a list I have made of my favorite movie princesses animated or live action. Overall, this film is an awesome fantasy to enjoy with all the adventure, humor and romance.",Clash of the Titans
81,rebeljenn,"a poor attempt, a slow film",2,6 November 2005,"'Clash of the Titans' is probably an example of one of the poorest adaptions from Greek mythology as an entertaining film. The film itself moves much too slowly and fails to keep interest. It attempts at making some humor, but it is incredibly dull and too long. It is certainly not scripted well for film.The animation was probably very good for its time, judging by the complexity of the characters who needed to be animated, such as the dog in the underworld and the gods. The type of animation now looks dated when compared to computer animation. I found the owl animation to be done very well, as it is not an organic being - thus, it looks realistic.I would not recommend this film.",Clash of the Titans

The story is, I believe, pretty well adapted for screen and they certainly spared no expense on the cast, having huge names in it. Alas, it is a poor production. Sure, it's hard to make monsters look real, but it seems that they barely tried. I had to work hard not to laugh aloud, especially at their depiction of Medusa! I think their SFX budget was $20. Now I know that SFX weren't as advanced as they are now, but they were certainly more advanced than what they used in the film. But the STORY carries this film (barely). The acting is pretty fair across the board, but not up to the stellar cast in the film. I may watch this again, but it'll be a while.",Clash of the Titans
83,FloatingOpera7,The Greatest Film About Greek Mythology,10,4 May 2006,"Clash Of The Titans (1981): Starring Harry Hamlin, Judi Bowker, Laurence Olivier, Maggie Smith, Claire Bloom, Ursula Andress, Jack Gwillim, Susan Fleetwood, Burgess Meredith, Sian Phillips, Flora Robson, Pat Roach...Director Desmond Davis, Screenplay Beverly Cross The films released around the time of my birth and first birthday (1980-1981)were full of breathtaking fantasy and special effects which served as an enhancement to a well-written adventure story, such as this one, based on the old Greek myth about the hero Perseus. Other than ""Clash Of The Titans"", 1980-1981 saw wondrous films like George Lucas' The Empire Strikes Back and Jon Boorman's Excalibur, as well as ""Lathe Of Heaven"" from the Leguin novel. Clash Of The Titans remains a perennial favorite among fantasy film lovers, and is truthfully the greatest of films concerning Greek mythology, despite earlier successes such as ""Jason And The Argonauts"". First thing first. This is not entirely accurate or faithful to the whole Perseus legend. Nevertheless some of it is true to the original myth (i.e. Perseu's mother, Queen Danae, who has a love affair with Zeus but is punished by her husband the King of Argos by being nailed into a coffin with her baby and sent out to sea, only to be saved by Zeus and secluded in an island where she raises Perseus, Perseus defeating Medusa, Perseus receiving a mirror-shield, the bit at the end about the constellations). But much of the movie contains material not found in Greek mythology, such as the goddess Thetis and her conflict with Zeus, the Kraken, the satyr-like Calabos, the golden mechanical pet owl of Athena Bo-Bo, Perseus going into the Underworld, and also quite frankly, Perseus was a minor hero and pale in comparison to the likes of Hercules, Achilles, Homer or Jason. This movie makes him out to be a great, sword-wielding, larger-than-life superhero. A muscular Harry Hamlin manages to embody the very Greek heroic and noble spirit of Perseus, and for an actor who was not as accomplished in film as he was on TV, he is doing a superb performance which he must fondly cherish. Laurence Olivier's Zeus is the best on record. He was quite older by this time but delivers a truly imperious, tyrannical and vainglorious king of the gods. Opposing him is Maggie Smith's Thetis, goddess of the sea who resented that her own son, Calabos, was cursed by being made into a gargoyle-like demon. Soon enough, Zeus sends Perseus on a quest to save princess Andromeda. The magic moments in this film, enhanced by a fine score and the stop-motion, claymation art of Harryhausen, include: the destruction of the city of Argos, Mount Olympus, the taming of Pegasus the flying horse, the defeat of Medusa, the encounter with the Stygian Witches and the descent into the Underworld conducted by Death himself and the final defeat of the Kraken. The score is composed by Laurence Rosenthal. This is a must have for fans of fantasy and mythology. Surely, Joseph Campbell would have loved this type of film. It's the most modern (at least for its time) rendition of myth- surpassing even the 50's and 60's Greek myth films. The cast is superb, particularly because it has Laurence Olivier as a strong backbone as well as other British actors- Claire Bloom, Maggie Smith and a very old Flora Robson as one of the Stygian witches. Flora Robson had performed Queen Elizabeth in ""The Sea Hawk"" opposite Errol Flynn and was a renowned British actress. Others in the cast include Ursula Andress in the role of love goddess Aphrodite, and even Playboy bunnies shed their bunny outfits and don togas and robes as goddesses at Zeus' court. The epic tale is brought to life through vivid color and special effects which is the real strength of this film as well as characters who must behave ""like gods"". This is a film full of whimsy and wonder and one that every myth and adventure lover should own.",Clash of the Titans
84,Hayden-86055,Good mythological action movie,7,26 January 2021,"This probably the best version of clash of the titans, yes the acting's a bit hammy and maybe the plot had a little more to be desired but the effects with stop motion are amazing, Medusa is terrifying and the Kraken is much more effective than in the remake. Action scenes build tension well, stunts could have perhaps been more energetic but atmosphere is spot on.7/10: Can't go wrong with giving this one a watch, most people will enjoy",Clash of the Titans
85,gigan-92,Classic Fantasy,9,7 January 2011,"one of my all time favorite fantasy films, released for all of us to enjoy long before the advent of CGI that runs amok in today's cinema. This is raw Ray Harryhausen gold at his finest and I'm glad to finally have bought this on DVD. Anybody who critiques this movie is thinking too hard. Simply sit back and enjoy the ride would you? The only weak aspect of this movie I could point out would be the B movie acting, but that's to be expected and really shouldn't deter what most and I myself consider a classic. Everything else in this film is superb. The story flows fluently and never drags and the characters, no matter how badly acted they maybe to you, are interesting and plot driven. If you look at it with the right perspective you could find this a very ideological piece, concerning the frailty of a man compared to a deity and how a man can truly over come the crushing binds of over-tyrannical religion. But hey, that's me, you might view it as just another Harryhausen flick.Regardless, the movie delivers on that aspect as well. The stop motion is life like, the pinnacle of its day and more than enough to stand against the over blown CGI-fest of today. There are so many visual feats in this movie, its hard to pick one that was truly my favorite. The amount of detail on each one is extraordinary. Overall, I'd say the Kraken is undoubtedly my favorite of them all, but my favorite scene all together is the battle with Sedusa. Just from the eerie start of the sequence with the boat ride across the foggy river to the dark and gloomy innards of her temple, all leading to a very intense fight. Not only does the cinematography always capture the tension and bold atmosphere of the film throughout. And the score by Laurence Rosenthal was just astonishing and sharpened every moment of the film beautifully. Whether it be the terror of Sedusa, or the majestic emergence of the Kraken, or rather the silence of the score as Perseus and his men battle the deadly scorpions.""Clash of the Titans"" is a classic by all means, even in the wake of its remake I believe the original is far superior.",Clash of the Titans

89,nickenchuggets,Harryhausen's legacy,9,10 June 2021,"Clash of the Titans is a movie that used to be one of the only movies I would really never get tired of watching, mostly because I liked the interesting storyline with strange beings from Greek mythology. Looking back on it though, it just seems ok. It's not really a paragon of good filmmaking, but it does have several good aspects. The movie is about the myth of Perseus, who is sent to sea as a child in a wooden box. Zeus orders a giant sea monster called the Kraken to destroy the city of Argos. Perseus and his mother float to an island, and he grows up there. Meanwhile, Calibos, the son of the goddess Thetis, is about to marry the Princess Andromeda, but Zeus has other ideas. He turns Calibos into a hideously deformed creature for angering him too many times. Perseus is then transported to an empty amphitheater, where he becomes friends with an old man played by Burgess Meredith. While there, Perseus discovers a shield, a sword, and a helmet that turns its wearer invisible. They are specially made by the gods themselves. After this, Andromeda sleepwalks into a cage carried by a vulture and is flown to meet with Calibos. She wants him to release her soul, but he refuses. Perseus fights Calibos, and manages to cut off one of his hands. Later on during a wedding between Perseus and Andromeda, an earthquake happens and causes the head of a Thetis statue to fall over. The head comes alive and tells Andromeda she must die and be sacrificed to the Kraken in 30 days because of the cruelty inflicted on Calibos. Perseus now has to find a way to kill the Kraken, but his flying horse, Pegasus, has been taken hostage. Afterwards, Perseus comes across a coven of blind witches with the help of a mechanical owl, but they tell him the Kraken cannot be killed. There is only one way to defeat it, but it's so dangerous he might as well not try. The method involves killing Medusa, because her gaze can turn any living creature to stone. Perseus and his men go to the River Styx and pay the skeleton ferryman to arrive at Medusa's lair. Many of Perseus' men die in the process, and soon, he's the only one left. After a particularly tense scene in which Perseus has to use the reflective side of his shield to avoid looking right at her, he decapitates Medusa, but loses his shield to her poisonous blood. After collecting her head, Perseus comes face to face with Calibos again, but not before Calibos stabs the sack containing the head of Medusa. Her blood produces giant scorpions that Perseus now has to fight. After killing them, Calibos is himself killed by a sword thrown by Perseus. Toward the end, Andromeda is almost ready to be executed, and the Kraken is summoned, but Perseus and his rescued Pegasus arrive just in time and unveil Medusa's head. Even when its decapitated, the head is able to turn the giant creature to stone, and Andromeda is saved. Perseus and her finally get married, and constellations are created in the night sky to honor him and his wife. It's a good movie, in spite of the fact that it has a lot of confusing plot points. Laurence Olivier is great as Zeus, and you very rarely get to see Laurence get angry. Meredith as the old man Ammon reminds me a lot of the classic character archetypes of master and student, kind of like King Arthur and the wizard Merlin from Sword in the Stone. The rest of the cast is just ok. Harry Hamlin doesn't really show that much emotion throughout the movie, and Judi Bowker as Andromeda isn't given much to do. She's just the typical girl in danger that the hero must rescue to move the story along. One of the best things about this movie is the stop motion effects, done by Ray Harryhausen. This would actually turn out to be his final animation work, which is sad. The Kraken, giant scorpions, vulture, mechanical owl, Medusa, and two headed dog outside Medusa's hideout were all done by him. It's a good movie, but nothing spectacular. Most people today who see it will probably be more interested in the special effects than the actual story.",Clash of the Titans
90,SkullScreamerReturns,Good mythological adventure with oldschool special effects,7,7 September 2021,"I've been wanting to see this film because Ray Harryhausen is a famous for his stop-motion special effects, and I'm tired of cgi.So, the movie tells the story of Perseus on his quest practically to save the princess and save the world and, you know, stuff that heroes do. The immortal gods and goddesses interact with the hero's journey, some helping him and some putting more obstacles in his way.What I liked about this film: well, the Greek mythology is always a good starting point for a fantasy-adventure. I believe the movie is quite faithful to the subject material. Also, even if you didn't know about these myths, it's still a very good adventure film. Harry Hamlin is likeable as the hero. Not a super muscle man but he's handsome enough and carries the role with enough charisma. Also Judi Bowker is a very good princess Andromeda. She's so beautiful that I'd also try to rescue her if I was the prince of Argos! But actually the only actor in the bunch that was previously familiar to me is Burgess Meredith as an old wise mentor and sidekick character. He's great as he usually is.The special effects do seem dated but I like that kind of style and admire the art of practical effects. There are also some other aspects of the film may seem a bit cheesy and silly but mostly the movie stays coherent. The comedy relief owl had a little bit too many scenes of falling from a tree etc. Which seemed like children's slapstick. But I don't mind. In any case you need to have at least some childlike mindset to watch this film.Overall I think it's a very good fantasy film for all ages, excluding very small kids because some of the monsters are scary. It's an adventure that is exciting, romantic, and has epic feel that makes you want to do heroic deeds. Now, excuse me, I need to stop typing and go to ask a princess on a date.",Clash of the Titans
91,Trevor-Kerensky,Ray Harryhausen's swan song and the other good movie on Greek mythology,8,19 May 2018,"When my Sixth Grade class was studying Ancient Greece in history class, we watched this movie. As the competitor to Star Wars, its stop motion animated creatures and effects were a bit dated but it worked as Ray Harryhausen's last film. We get the story of Perseus, demigod son of Zeus, and his quest to save the princess Andromeda from certain doom. Avoid the remake and its followup and see this! It's got some family friendly moments though some of the scenes may be a little dark for young eyes. The creatures were the best part and they have nothing on today's CGI, which seems a little overrated and overdone. This and Jason and the Argonauts should be your movies if you love Greek mythology and want to try a movie based on that theme. Of course, if you want to learn more about that mythology in books, you can always get Percy Jackson. But this is the better version of Clash of the Titans. No spoilers!",Clash of the Titans
92,smakawhat,Release the Kracken DAMIT!,5,14 June 2001,"A retelling of the Greek myth story of Persius, Clash of the Titans can be taken into one of 2 veins.  As either a dumb romp through a swashbuckling tale of adventure and lame effects and perhaps paper characters but entertaining nonetheless, or a film that tried to make a serious go at method acting that failed misserably between a quagmire of shoddy writing and directing.  While I think both statements are accurate I think I'd have to side with the former.Clash of the Titans is one of those cheesy films that you end up sitting through cause you know it will be cheesy and you enjoy the corny effects.  I kind of picture this film as being one of those cult classics that people could go to in the theatre dressing up like the characters and reciting the lines (such as the Rocky Horror picture show).  'RELEASE THE KRACKEN!'  I can hear it now and picture it, it seemed that would work perfectly.The film fails on grander levels such as acting that is sub-par, a horribly misplaced tin can owl who has the mentality of R2-2 but non of the charisma (why would they make a ROBOTIC owl is beyond me), a weak lead who says little if anything, and dialogue between the gods which seems pointless to the story and almost unnecesary.Kind of like one reviewers point that it was similar to the 'Star Wars' phenomenon, you have a good vs evil, a talking tin can, a young warrior out to save the princess, the evil Vader-Kraken character, etc.. etc.. but what they hey.  It's the film you will be able to sit through when you got nothing else to watch on the TV at 2:00 AM.  And for that it's probably perfect.Rating 5 out of 10.",Clash of the Titans

Ray Harryhausen returns to work his magic, and his swan song remains an utter spectacle. However, with masters of the acting profession such as Laurence Olivier, Maggie Smith and Burgess Meredith etc. Why would you include a majority of others that really cannot convince or emote properly? Regardless, none of these type of movies where entirely scripted too well, but everything that came before prior feels more timeless.The performances in this film are shockingly wooden, but Harryhausen's effects are still A-class. It's really sad when the creatures perform better than the actual actors.Final Verdict: Medusa's lair is still by far the best part of the movie, but to get to it is quite a burden. 6/10.",Clash of the Titans
94,disinterested_spectator,The Movie and the Myth,6,1 January 2016,"Ray Harryhausen has provided the special effects for many movies, some of them quite good. In ""Clash of the Titans,"" however, one gets the feeling that instead of the special effects being used to dramatize the story, the story is guided by the desire to display some special effects. The result is rather lackluster. The story in the movie, however, such as it is, is a big improvement over the original myth. In fact, this movie, when compared to the source material, provides an excellent example of the need to modify ancient tales in order to make them suitable for modern audiences.As for the story in the movie, much is driven by the lunacy of the gods. When the unmarried Danaë has a child (Perseus) out of wedlock, her father, King Acrisius, feels that he and all of Argos have been dishonored by her sin. He is especially put out by the fact that he had locked her in a room where no man could get at her beautiful body, but she got pregnant anyway. (In the original myth, Danaë's son was destined to kill Acrisius, which was his motive for trying to keep her away from men, but in the movie, Acrisius is simply jealous of her beauty.) To purge the dishonor, he condemns his daughter and her child to die in a coffin set adrift at sea. Zeus, it turns out, was the father, having visited Danaë as a shower of gold. Zeus is horrified that Acrisius of Argos would commit a murder, so to punish him, he has Poseidon unleash the Kraken, a sea monster, to wipe out the entire city of Argos.Perseus falls in love with Andromeda, who is under the spell of Calibos, the hideously disfigured son of Thetis. Perseus chops off the hand of Calibos, who then begs his mother for justice. She is reluctant, because she suspects her son wants revenge rather than justice. But when Queen Cassiopeia dares to claim that her daughter Andromeda is more beautiful than Thetis herself, that is just too much. As punishment for insulting her beauty, she demands that Andromeda be sacrificed to the Kraken. Almost as an afterthought, she says that this will give her son justice too. So, Andromeda must be punished for what Perseus did to Calibos as well as for a remark made by her mother Cassiopeia, a remark, by the way, which happens to be spot on. A running theme through all this is that guilt and punishment are not individual matters; instead, punishment may fall on anyone who is associated with the person who committed the misdeed. Unfortunately, such insane notions of justice are frequently found in the myths of ancient religions, and there are still vestiges of such notions even today.Anyway, Perseus has to figure out a way to kill the Kraken and save his beloved Andromeda. After much to do, he learns that he must obtain the head of Medusa, a gorgon whose look will turn any living creature to stone. Perseus chops off her head and returns in time to let the Kraken get a good look at it, turning him to stone. Andromeda is saved, and she and Perseus are married and live happily ever after.Now compare that with the original story. When Perseus set out to get the head of the Medusa, he didn't know Andromeda from Adam. He just needed a wedding present for a king who was getting married. Perseus got the head, put it in a bag, and headed for home, hoping he would be in time for the nuptials. On the way there, he saw the beautiful, naked Andromeda tied to a rock, while being threatened by Cetus, the other name for the sea monster. He decided to save her, but first he made sure nothing happened to his wedding present by putting it behind some rocks for safekeeping. Then he killed Cetus with his sword. Having seen Andromeda naked, he just had to have her, so they got married. Then he grabbed the bag with the head in it and headed off for the wedding that started it all.The story is vastly more complicated than that, especially since different versions stand in contradiction with one another. But the point is that the story in the movie is a definite improvement, and so much so, that it proves that we should not be terribly concerned with how faithful a movie is to the source material, so long as the movie is enjoyable. Unfortunately, ""Clash of the Titans,"" while an improvement over the original myth, is only fair.",Clash of the Titans

Of the rest we can say the following: the plot honors Greek mythology, the Mediterranean landscapes are spectacular, the sets are very good, the cast well directed and the female beauty well represented. The problem is in the plot as it progresses slowly and it shows that with an adequate editing the film would have gained vigor and rhythm which it lacks.

There are Perseus, Andromeda, the vain queen Cassiopeia and the dreaded Medusa, who has snakes for hair. I tend to look away from her while knowing it is just a movie.

97,revival05,Old fashioned telling of ancient stories,7,9 April 2010,"Ay, these are the times we live in. When a big Hollywood blockbuster is being promoted all over the world, a clever moviegoer will not rush to see it, but rather check out the movie it is a remake of. Clash of the Titans is the perfect example. I've seen the trailer at various screenings, naturally. To me, Liam Neeson dressed up like Leonardo da Vinci in a war helmet shouting ""Release the Kraken!"" seemed preposterous enough, but the CGI war feast flashing in front of the poor audience gave me the sneaking suspicion that this is in fact quite a depressing, er, product. Not that I am an enemy to mainstream schlockfests, nor to CGI, on the contrary I'm probably one of the biggest defenders of it you'll find who's not George Lucas. But it just seemed charmless.Watching Clash of the Titans from 1981 makes it even clearer. Charm is the key word. By this time in cinema history, it's not a movie that will win any new audiences, and it will certainly not impress a ten year old who's been growing up with mobile phones and Pokemon. But it pretty much your perfect Sunday morning matinée. I recommend it strongly along with some pizza and soda, around the time your aspirins are starting to kick in.It's also fairly educative if your Greek mythology is a little rusty. The Greek Gods have rarely been this straight forward and silly. Zeus - Laurence Olivier, no less! - is wonderfully proud when talking about his beloved son Perseus, and equally cruel when sentencing poor Calibos to live his life as a hideously ugly swamp thing in a remote place resembling... well, a swampy thing. The intrigue is a little contrived, as these things tend to be, but in case you're not familiar with it, in a nutshell it's all about our handsome hero Perseus having to go through quite the ordeal in order to marry the pretty princess Andromeda, who none of the Gods seem to care very much for. She's cursed by Calibos and sentenced to death by his goddess mother Thetis, eaten by the Kraken in the most King Kong of fashions. Thus, Perseus has to go up in the air with his noble winged horse Pegasus, cut off the head of the Medusa monster, fight Calibos at least twice, challenge some cackling witches, naturally attempt to kill the Kraken, etc.But enough of this nonsequental talk of plot. The Clash of the Titans has a storybook plot that you'll find anywhere else (preferably in a storybook) and what makes it a nice experience has to do with three important factors. First off, we have a cast of actors who are exactly the kind of old school elite that would attempt to play this silliness as seriously as possible. Burgess Meredith is very nice as Perseus' sidekick Ammon, a kind and wise old playwright who comes off as a Mickey Goldmill on tranquilizers. Laurence Olivier is, as you'd imagine, more than enough of a Zeus kind of guy, and two of the greatest and most gorgeous English actresses are battling lines as Hera and Thetis - Claire Bloom and Maggie Smith. At one point, they share the scene with a third goddess, Aphrodite, played by Ursula Andress. Why of course! She is after all the Arnold Schwarzenegger of femininity. As is suitable, she has got one line.The other two things are Ray Harryhausen, and I can't believe I've gone this far without mentioning him. His craftsmanship in this one is simply a delight. The effects work has an eclectic quality that makes certain sequences both surreal and unforgettable. Mixing backdrops, optical illusions with rubber suits and stop-motion, plus some old fashioned tricks, the effects aren't ""bad"" or ""dated"" as much as they are basically just weird and surreal, imaginative rather than effectively realistic. And the creatures he made for Clash of the Titans are also fantastic to look at, be it the spooky night flying viper or the crawling Medusa, or Bobo the Golden Owl, a wise helpful little friend who comes off more as a flying tincan, distantly related to both R2-D2 and C-3PO (and no, let's not go there).I'm sure I'll eventually see the 2010 version of this spectacle. But I don't think my review of that film will be half as long as this one. This Clash of the Titans has an old fashioned quality to it, it's the kind of storytelling I found in comic books and fairy tales as a kid, and dated or not these effects would have granted a great experience for me, had I seen this when I was little. I wonder, will children growing up today feel any nostalgia over the new Clash of the Titans? I have a hard time seeing how. It seems generic and anonymously spectacular. This one isn't all that original either, but it's ambitious enough to have a charm of it's own. It's really all you can expect from a movie that releases the Kraken.",Clash of the Titans
98,daniewhite-1,Classic Toy fights,6,3 January 2021,"Being the last example of the special effects of Ray Harryhausen is the obvious draw of this otherwise limited film; however 'Clash of the Titans' does seem to posses some merits beyond its stop motion monsters.The location photography is sometimes attractive and even beautiful, the musical score whilst not exceptional is adequate to complement the adventures and the costumes and props are quite nicely arrayed. Also the younger cast, male and female, are mostly attractive adornments for 'Clash of the Titans' in its creation of eye candy vistas.The treatment of mixing up myths is pretty juicy and the behavior of the Olympic God's seems well judged in my opinion.They come across as jerks and childish yobs with Zeus the king of the gods as 'king jerk' and they interfere, molest and divert the humans along lines if favoritism and familial loyalty.This seems to be an only half way blasphemous treatment of that religions godly pantheon if I'm honest!!The actors playing the high ones all give stately British thespian playing for their characters which invites the audience to glean more about their individual characters and character dynamic from the frequent silences and quick, half hidden, sideways looks of unspoken communication than from the characters dialogues.The young leading cast have just enough personality to hang their costumes on which on this adventure is all that required of them by the non existent human characterisations in the script.This complements the idea that it is really the gods driving everything and not the humans at all. A theme hinted at by the aging wisdom of Burgess Meredith's wise writer.The script however is really the reason that I can't rate this spasmodically fun and enervating adventure flick any higher than a 6/10 because it simply wastes itself with a far too dull and unsatisfying finish!!The climax is a let down: the finale is all ""anti"" and little ""climax"" and really leaves an unfortunate flattening of my enjoyment as the film wanders off into its heavenly epilogue.This is a travesty of a scripting error compounded by Ray Harryhausen's kraken being less interesting the more that you see of it.For the most part however the Harryhausen effects kept me fully onside and combined well with the semi satirical Olympus scenes of divine devilment.I rate a 6/10 and I recommend to every Ray Harryhausen fan and to fans of old fashioned fantasy/adventure films: this is not on the same level as Harryhausen two best films 'The 7th Voyage of Sinbad' or 'Jason and the Argonauts' but it outshines some of his less successful dabbles and many other films of this genre; even with its badly paced last act and disappointing climactic set piece.I have one final quibble which is that the film has no Titans in it at all that I could see!

105,kylehodgdon,A Good Adventure Film,7,5 December 2009,"I would have to say, ""Clash of the Titans"" is a pretty satisfying adventure film. The plot reminded me of that of Homer's ""Odessy"", which is definitely not a bad thing. Come to think of it, I would almost like to see more epic adventure tales like this on the big screen. Having watched this for the first time in 2009, and being born after it was made makes this type of film a bit tricky to review, since it hinged on special effects. But I think they did a nice job with them. I was especially impressed with Medusa. There was not really anything that I really thought looked bad. The mechanical owl employes a bit of comedy to the film and will definitely remind you of R2- D2. It was also neat to see all kinds of mythological creatures come together for a film like this. This film might be a little outdated, almost thirty years after it's release, but only by a little. It is still very enjoyable today.",Clash of the Titans
106,BB-15,Oldie But Goodie,8,7 December 1999,"Clash of the Titans is in many ways the best example of the classic action film. The story is solidly based on Greek myth with the archetypal hero and princess, the monsters and the Greek Gods. The quality of the film making is good and it is all blended with above average special effects.
The creator of these special effects which dominate the movie, Ray Harryhausen, also helped to make other quality films such as Jason and the Argonauts. His influence is wide spread (see the monster in Jabba the Hut's palace in Return of the Jedi) and I enjoy the imagination of his creations.
This ancient story can be considered corny from being so familiar but that didn't bother me. Minor drawbacks include the stiff acting in these movies, usually old fashioned stage acting. (Also, the characters on Mount Olympus often just stand around.) But there are wonderful stage actors in Titans, Lawrence Olivier, Maggie Smith and Claire Bloom and their talent shows. Harry Hamlin unsuccessfully tries to emulate this style. Burgess Meredith gives a natural, superior performance and Neil McCarthy and Tim Pigott-Smith are good in supporting roles. The Star Wars Trilogy spelled the end of big budget films like Clash of the Titans. (Now we get anemic efforts from Australia.) There is a cute robotic bird in the film, a small gesture to Lucas, but swords and winged horses are no match for lasers and space ships at light speed. Clash of the Titans isn't fresh but it doesn't have huge blunders either. There are no silly Ewoks and isn't it refreshing to watch an action film without seeing a thousand machine gun bullets being fired? I thought so and enjoyed this nostalgic film.",Clash of the Titans
107,kitellis-98121,A beloved favourite from my childhood.,9,23 July 2018,"I rated this a 9. That's very high. I would have given it a 10, purely to help this version maintain a higher rating than the abysmal and disrespectful 2010 remake. But I couldn't give a 10 to a film that is as flawed as it is - despite my oodles of sentimentality and love where this film is concerned.It isn't a masterpiece. It has dated quite badly. It was a little clunky even when it was new. However...This film has heart. And it has class. Two things that the remake failed to deliver even as a dribble.It also has some of Ray Harryhausen's best work, which although signalling the approaching end of an era, it was a very long and distinguished era which should be respected and appreciated, rather than derided and scorned (as ""modern"" audiences tend to do).Sadly my generation is the last one that can really appreciate and enjoy films like Clash of the Titans (1981), as we straddle the line between the two eras. We remember the days when CGI hadn't yet been invented; when books, films, and TV shows that were from a bygone era were not viewed as obsolete but merely older - because neither technology nor society had progressed to the point that they were unrecognisable. Old movies were just that: old. But we still grew up watching and enjoying them.""Modern"" audiences have been raised on a diet of nothing but ""new"" and have therefore been denied the ability to appreciate and respect anything that predates their own minimal life span. And that is a terrible shame.Clash of the Titans (1981) is a gorgeous, charming, enthralling feast of storytelling and imagination, with some of the best stop-motion characters from the Harryhausen workshop, a stellar cast of humans, and a music score that is as hummable and uplifting as you could wish. It was also inspirational to me personally in a variety of ways.I'm glad that I'm able to love and enjoy fantasy films that predate CGI, because there are so many great ones out there, dating back to the earliest days of cinema. And it doesn't mean I can't also love and enjoy the ""modern"" ones too. I'm a huge fan of the LOTR franchise, and became totally obsessed with WETA Workshop, WETA Digital, Richard Taylor et al.I grew up watching Harryhausen's films, and the documentaries about their creation (I later got to work with him briefly, which was a real thrill), and as an adult I have been equally enthralled by the ever-evolving digital technology, from Jurassic Park through LOTR and onwards, and the behind-the-scenes documentaries that came with them, which are much better and more detailed than those in Harryhausen's day! I love it all; the whole glorious process of movie-making, in all its infinite variety.For me, old and new are NOT mutually exclusive. But I'm one of the lucky ones.",Clash of the Titans

111,fisherforrest,This film is not the best way to study classical mythology.,6,9 July 2006,"Beverley Cross, our screenwriter, was no more meticulous in sticking to the details of mythological legends than other writers before her when dealing with history or biography. So, if you are really interested in knowing what the legendary founder of Mycenae was reputed to have done, go to the Encyclopedia Britannica for a concise summary. The film does stick to the broad outlines of Perseus' career, but the devil is in the details. It would be tedious to list all of the departures, but one or two may be in order. Perseus had little to do with the flying horse Pegasus, beyond the ""fact"" that the horse was created from the blood of Medusa after Perseus cut off her head as she slept (not as shown in the film). The sea monster that Perseus is to slay to save Danae (his mother, not Andromeda, an Ethiopian princess in a later adventure of Perseus)is called ""the Kraken"". How in heck did a Scandinavian bug-bear get into the story? Oh, well. By the way, the Olymnpian God most active in helping Perseus was Hermes, who is completely eliminated from the film story. Why go on? You get the picture. Well, there is one more thing. Where does the title of the film come from? The Titans were a pantheon of Gods, two of whom, Rhea and Cronus, were the parents of Zeus. He overthrew the Titans and imprisoned them in the underworld. In the film, the Kraken sea-monster is called the ""last of the Titans"". Sure, it makes no sense, but what the heck? Let's leave the discrepancies and go on to the shortcomings of the film in other areas. Ray Harryhausen had done a number of low-budget ""monster"" movies over a period of 25 years, using stop-motion photography of small models to create his effects, the same technique used to create ""King Kong"" in 1933. CLASH OF THE TITANS was his last film, and it was big-budget. But the money was spent on an expensive cast, not on more modern technology. Some of Ray's effects in this film are better than others, but except that now we have wide-screen colour, they are no better than those in KING KONG in 1933.And the members of that expensive cast have little to do but stand around and pontificate, argue and threaten. It was a waste of major talent, really, but I guess Laurence and the others consoled themselves on the way to the bank. All the action is dominated by young Harry Hamlin and the various ""creatures"". The Pegasus is beautiful but not very convincing as a special effect. The Medusa, though, and the Kraken are truly fearsome, as are the giant scorpions. They are the best animations in the film. By the way, don't let the kids see CLASH OF THE TITANS. They might get the erroneous notion that all undraped females look as gorgeous as the ones on view here. The disappointments later on might warp their little psyches.",Clash of the Titans

And just as ""Jason and the Argonauts"", the movie does not follow the myth that close and that doesn't make it better (it would be better if ""Excalibur"" released in the same year would step aside from the myth a bit and if this would stay closer since this is a good story from the beginning). The adaptation makes it a bit simpler and a bit more predictable than the myth. This movie has far from a perfect script.The action-scene against Medusa is however very good, and I wouldn't mind if Hollywood would do a new real serious Persevs-movie that follows the myth, directed by perhaps Jackson, instead of throwing money on Lord of the Rings-garbage. Persevs is for me one of the greatest heroes ever, and Medusa the most terrifying villain.There is an owl of metal in the film that is a bit funny!Finally, you can't claim a movie to be awful just because of the special-effects, the special effects isn't the most important thing in a movie.Rating: 5 of 10.",Clash of the Titans

This solid retelling of the Greek myth of Perseus (played by Harry Hamlin) rescuing Andromeda (Judi Bowker) is fairly faithful to its source material despite some glaring errors (for instance, the mother of all monsters in this film, The Kraken, actually comes from Norse mythology). The acting is better than viewers give it credit for; in fact, Hamlin's stiff performance benefits his character portrayal instead of hurting it. The unique cast portraying the Olympians includes Laurence Olivier (Zeus), Claire Bloom (Hera), and Maggie Smith (Thetis, who wasn't among this company), plus first-ever Bond girl Ursula Andress (Aphrodite), and Susan Fleetwood (Athena), deceased sister of Mick Fleetwood, while Burgess Meredith livened up the film's dreary atmosphere as old playwright Ammon.

119,uroshnor54,Not Ray Harryhausen's Best Work,5,24 February 2014,"The story of CLASH OF THE TITANS isn't very good. But most people who want to see it probably won't care anyway. I know I didn't. They probably want to watch the movie because it was the last movie Ray Harryhausen worked on. However, the special effects aren't very good either. I don't know much about stop-motion special effects but I don't think this is really his best work. JASON AND THE ARGONAUTS, ONE MILLION YEARS B.C., and Harryhausen's SINBAD movies all have better effects. Just watch the battle between the triceratops and the ceratosaurus in ONE MILLION YEARS B.C. or the skeleton fight in JASON AND THE ARGONAUTS. The only part of CLASH OF THE TITANS that I thought matched these sequences was the scene with Medusa. And I must say that they just build up Medusa too much. She's awesome but the one of the Stygian Witches says something like ""She's more dangerous than a hundred krakens"" or something like that. Yeah, that's a bit of an exaggeration.And I guess I should write a little about the story. It's pretty bad. I don't mind that they put a kraken in a story that is supposed to be based on Greek mythology. I don't really mind any mythological inaccuracies. What I do mind is that it's unoriginal. You can talk about the ""Hero's Journey"" all you want but just because a lot of quest stories follow a certain pattern, it doesn't mean that writers can't try to be a bit original.

Still, Harryhausen's creations offer some visuals that many associate with their childhood film experience. The Medusa scene scared me as a child. The Scorpion fight scene is fantastic. Even though the performances are limited, the storyline is goofy, and the art is behind the times.........it is a film that accomplishes exactly what it is set out to do. What is that?

121,cat-that-goes-by-himself,Nothing impressive and no excuse I could think of,3,6 September 2006,"It may have looked OK in an alternate reality where Star Wars and Alien did not happen, but 3 or 4 years after episode IV and 2 years after the 8th passenger, these jerky stop-motion scenes were not an excuse for a movie anymore. Plus you can find movies of the same era with far, far better effects stop motion scenes: krull, the dark crystal, never-ending story. Even the saber-toting robots of starcrash :) - not even speaking of the snow creatures in star wars V.I don't blame the special effect guys, rather the script writer who obviously failed to take into account - or thought he could cope with - the technical limitations. Look at Krull for instance, they did use stop motion with a spider in its web, and the result was very good. Now try the same with flying horses or vultures and you get nothing but jerky puppets unable to blend with the background as a result. Back in 1963 it was a revolution in special effect when they blended actors and puppets into the same pictures in Jason and the argonauts. Looks like 20 years were not enough to solve the gamma correction problem, and frankly better show the puppets and the actors in different frames than have a brightly lit guy over a blue screen blend with a jerky two-headed wolf that looks like it was filmed under the moonlight.Now for the plot. Unfortunately the movie is built around the special effects. Would it have had some decent story to tell, I wouldn't have minded so much the poor visuals. I could even have forgiven the blatant R2D2 rip-off for the owl (I wonder if Lucas sued them for that?). Mythology-wise, they seemingly picked their way through a reader's digest selection of various myths, with the Macbeth witches and the kraken as guest stars.OK, so we've got bad pictures and a bad plot so far. The actors maybe? Well this bunch of pretty famous people sure must have had a lot of bills to pay, for judging from the heart they put into their roles it's not out of love for the script they played in this movie. At least Andromeda is quite pretty, including when she cries - a good thing since she does that a lot. But was the showing of her breasts and buttocks an attempt to make the movie worth viewing for teenagers?To sum it up, this movie was a complete disappointment. I give it a 3 for the Andromeda cutie and the funny old geezer that accompanies the rather bland hero through this uninspiring quest.

Most of the acting was superb. Of course, Olivier was the obvious choice to play Zeus. The other immortals were all classic film and stage stars. Maggie Smith was most notable as Thetis.

This film has even been used in classrooms to demonstrate the fable for both an entertaining and educational account.Based upon traditional Greek mythology, this film illustrates this legend to a tee. The tale of Perseus in search of the one thing which can overcome The Kraken {a most impressive Leviathan / Cthulhu - like creature unleashed by Poseidon}, which just so happens to be Medusa's head, containing the power to transform humans into stone {Medusa was unfairly cursed by Hera after being seduced by Zeus}. But first, with the sage help of 'Ammon' {Burgess Meredeth}, demigod Perseus must realize who he is, the son of Zeus, and gather the implements to fulfill his 'destiny', including an invisibility cloak. and an impregnable sword and shield. After passing a riddle test initiated by Hera, he follows a huge vulture upon the winged steed Pegusus to battle Calibos {a demonic archetype and son of Hera cursed by Zeus to malformation}, and is prompted upon his quest to save Princess Andromeda from being sacrificed to The Kraken. Along the way, he meets The Stygian Witches, three cannibalistic hags who share an oracle named 'The Eye'; Charon, or ""The Devil's Boatman"" {a Grim Reaper archetype} at the River Styx which carries he and his men to The Underworld; Cerberus, {here depicted with two heads instead of the usual three}; and finally Medusa, in a memorably striking humanoid / serpentine representation.The characters are dynamically brought to life and very well animated with pre-CGI stop-motion photography, and the costumes and sets are rendered to splendid authenticity. The Gods are appropriately displayed with very human traits, considering that man has created his gods in his own image.

The special effects aren't the problem--not only were they actually quite good for the most part, but I've never had a problem getting into even films with awful special effects, so long as the acting and/or writing is good (old Star Trek episodes, anyone?).  The problem in this film is that the acting is, quite frankly, wooden and emotionless.  The actors portraying the gods do a good job...just about everyone else is unconvincing...to the point of taking a person right out of the film.  It isn't so much that they're actively bad as it is that they're just...boring. Bad acting is fun to watch--I can at least have fun ""MSTing"" it.  Boring acting isn't...it's just drab, not bad enough to give me allegedly witty comments to make about it, but not good enough to be worth watching.  That's where most of the actors in this film rest, particularly the lead male, playing Perseus. The writing is pretty sloppy at times, too...for a few examples, we're told that Medusa's blood is poisonous, and that if anyone touches it they'll die...but we're never told, to my knowledge, that it also happens to be able to be used to turn little scorpions into big scorpions for a fighting sequence that seems only placed in there so one of the main characters can get killed (which inspires, unsurprisingly, no emotion from Perseus).  For another example--we build up to Pegasus for the entire movie, and it's finally freed and used by Perseus...and is knocked out of the sky moments into the fight.  Unless I'm recalling things incorrectly (which is possible, it's been a while since I saw the film), Perseus proceeds to defeat the monster without Pegasus' help.  If you're going to put a supernatural winged horse into the film and build to the hero using it for half the movie, you really should have it actually be useful for more than just the basic transportation to the final battle. Yes, there /should/ be a remake of this...or rather, another film based on the same Greek myths.  Ancient mythology contains a lot of great stories, and they deserve better films than this as representation.

133,TG22Film,A classic production,9,28 January 2006,"I saw this when I was very young, and it literally fuelled my imagination. After seeing the scene with the Medusa for the first time, I recall the odd nightmare here and there. This might seem laughable, but get lost in a great film when you're six years old- then it tends to have effects on what you dream later on.This adventure fantasy based on the Greek mythology of Perseus is tense, exciting and moving. This, in part, is due to the beautiful musical score (Laurence Rosenthal) and clever screenplay in scenes of danger and tension. I also found the concept of the all powerful gods and the figurines of all their people fascinating. I Particularly found the transfiguration of Calibos disturbing, and clever. This is excellent film-making, rather than showing Calibos himself transform, we see a silhouette of the figure of his physical being slowly change shape.So, Perseus is born, despite the attempt of King Acrisius to murder him and his mother ( by throwing them in a box that floats on the sea- not the cleverest of ways to kill off an enemy). Perseus ends up safe and sound with his mother on an island, where eventually he is castaway by the goddess Thetis to a darker place so he can face a real challenge. This is Thetis's way of getting back at Zeus for punishing her son Calibos.Andromeda plays the role of the princess, and Calibos plays the role of (in modern terms) her ex, who has now turned into a beast at the hands of Zeus. Thetis, still pretty pent up about her son, especially after losing a hand, intends to avenge his state of affairs by the death of Andromeda through the deadly Kraken. It is Perseus who stands in the way of Calibos, and the Kraken, in order to save the Princess and the Greek city from doom.Thusly, this film has politics, romance, horror, tension, philosophy and all kinds of other elements to it. Again, for me, the highlight is the build up to the Medusa's lair. Indeed, it was very scary stuff as a young kid, I used to look away from the screen when her face appeared. All in all, this is a really entertaining film with depth and wisdom. If there's one thing that could make it better, it would be to make it longer.",Clash of the Titans
134,pbbuffyhugs,Great Film,9,13 June 2008,"For years my favourite Ray Harryhausen movie was 'The Golden Voyage Of Sinbad' but as I've got older 'Clash Of The Titans' has slowly replaced it. For a start it's a lot darker in tone - unworthy suitors to the Princess Andromeda being burnt, Andromeda herself having to be sacrificed to the Kracken and Medusa getting her head sliced off (Medusa also being a nightmarish creation). The film censors in the UK originally gave this film a 15 certificate - possibly for 2 sequence's that show brief nudity (Each time I've seen this film on TV they always cut these scenes but then again they usually keep showing it on Sunday afternoons!) The story is interesting - The bit on the isle of the Dead is fantastic as is the final 10 minutes - and papers over any cracks in some of the acting although I personally think Harry Hamlin does OK. Burgess Merideth fits his part perfectly and Olivier as Zeus commands the respect the role needs. The special effects by Ray Harryhausen are obviously not as good as what can be done today using computers and CGI but I think that because it was all done by stop motion it adds to the charm - indeed this was probably one of the last films to fully use this technique and any way - the effects in this film are far better than Harryhausen/Schneers previous movie 'Sinbad And The Eye Of The Tiger' (which unlike this film has a lot of padding). I like this film a lot - it's a great way to waste a few hours and there's also another reason I love this film... When Perseus first enters the city and sees the burning body of Andromedas last unsuccessful suitor he is told by a guard that men are willing to sacrifice themselves just to have a kingdom to rule over - Sod that!!- just getting Andromeda in the sack would be enough for me.. Judi Bowker is absolutely, heart stopping- drop dead Stunning. 9/10",Clash of the Titans

This movie fascinated me when I was really young, and I still get a kick out of it.  There is a heck of a lot of adventure crammed into this film: the three witches, the ferryman, the multi-headed dog, Medusa, Calibos and his swamp kingdom (including the giant vulture), Pegasus, giant scorpions, the Kraken, a mechanical owl, the meddling of gods in the affairs of humans...whew!  I'm sure I've forgotten some things, but just look at that list!  Plus the score really enhances the feel--I can hear the ""flight of Pegasus"" (my name, not the official one) music in my head as I write this.  This movie is pure fun and if you turn a critical eye upon it and start bemoaning the claymation effects and whatnot, you're really missing the point.

137,stephenmogg,Mythical Special Effects...!,7,8 August 2002,"It's hard to be subjective about this movie as it pushes a lot of nostalgia buttons for me - I loved the escapism it provided back in my youth. Seeing it again on terrestrial TV recently surprised me how late the movie is (1981) compared to other Harryhausen movies of the early 60's. This movie which is 5 years younger than Star Wars is really using technology from another era and it shows. Putting that aside, there are some fine cast members with Olivier providing a little gravitas and Maggie Smith camping it up as usual. Hamlin is wooden but then I suspect he was hired for other attributes. Seeing it again, I really enjoyed the film, it's a great story and some of the imagery is still pretty effective even if you can see the join between reality and 'effects'. Its out on DVD and I might just buy it to see it in the original apect ratio and to buy a little bit of my childhood back.",Clash of the Titans
138,gregg-39,Pure Classic childhood film!,9,1 August 2001,"This is one of the many Harryhausen films that I grew up loving, always cheered up when I found out one was going to be on during the week. Out of them all the two that stand out the most for me are Jason and the Argonauts and this.I am dismayed at some of the flack some other comments have given this enjoyable movie, admittedly some of the acting and script aren't of the highest standard but none of it really strikes me as particularly bad, besides to get a real sense of fantasy the script needs to be a little serious and unusual (this sort of film doesn't work well with modern colloquial speech and references). Many great actors are in it as well.The script and acting are beside the point in one of these films, its all in style and stop-motion animation that the real joy is found.  The Ancient Greek atmosphere feels genuine (as far as speaking English goes) and Ray Harryhausen has put in some of his best work here, see especially Pegasus the winged-horse and Medusa.Something that many other comments have touched on is the variances between this story and actual myths.  Very few of these films were directly intended to be reconstructions of the myths, more the myths were used as a platform upon which the various action pieces and special effects could be placed, hence with so many mythological creatures and characters the mixing enables more to be included without cramming, the cross of Medusa with a Naga as mentioned elsewhere is a perfect example of this.For all those who criticise the special effects I say this, recent criticism of Final Fantasy demonstrate the fallibility of CGI, which is often overlooked if in films where it is used more sparingly. Yes you can tell where the stop-motion is but, likewise you can usually see matte-lines in other films and spot CGI effects nearly all the time, even in the best films if you know the signs, the only films that has really successfully implicated the CGI technology in terms of seemlessness, for me are Jurassic Park and T2, both of which also use stop-motion or animatronics as well.",Clash of the Titans
139,darius_m_klein,Worthy final Harryhausen film,8,26 January 2009,"Fortunately, Ray Harryhausen's final film is one worthy of his talents (not quite true of the two preceding Sinbad films). While I wouldn't call it a masterpiece, ""Clash of the Titans"" is quite an impressive productions in many respects. This is particularly true with regard to the use of locations and painted backdrops (and, of course, the creature effects, it goes without saying). Compared to many other mythological films, this one sticks admirably close to the actual storyline as it's been handed down. I especially liked the depiction of the gods behaving crassly - it was Greek mythology rather than Hollywood.My main complaint regarding ""Clash of the Titans"" (*SPOILER* aside from Hamlin's seventies' hairstyle and the fact that the final confrontation with the Kraken could have been more dramatic**) is the glaring influence of ""Star Wars"" (inevitable I suppose). This influence can be seen in the R2D2-like Bubo - a character obviously intended to be cute, but not one that really added much to the plot. The musical soundtrack is also very much in the ""Star Wars"" style - I thought that the ""Clash of the Titans"" was good enough that it really begged for a musical score that was intelligent, exotic, and dramatic (sadly, Bernard Hermann was no longer among the living at the time of production), not Laurence Rosenthal's saccharine fluff.But even with these distracting elements, Harryhausen's talent as an artist carries the day in the end. ""The Clash of the Titans"", compelled as it was to make certain small concessions to a lesser commercial standard of fantasy film-making, still easily rises far above the average fantasy effort in its imagery, creature effects, and literate script.",Clash of the Titans
140,zombie134,One of the best of the Harryhausen films!,7,19 December 2005,"Ray Harryhausen and producer Charlie Schneer at their best. Good casting and an upbeat score helped this one along. Laurence Olivier's presence hangs over the rest of the cast and amplifies their performances. Having good seasoned veteran actors like Burgess Meredith and Claire Bloom also lent to this films integrity. Harry Hamlin and Judi Bowker's performances were never really very charged, but became sort of focal points for a supporting cast of interesting characters. The musical score was good like many Schneer productions (I personally like the score from Mysterious Island the best). The effects were some of Harryhausens finest. Good charismatic mythical creatures that were familiar to a wide audience. The character of Calibos was definitely a unique and well acted bad guy. His character, with exception to Zeus, seemed to have the most substance. I found the lighting to be a bit poor in some scenes, most notably the giant scorpion scene. But some scenes were extraordinary. The Medusa encounter was quite suspenseful for a fantasy film. This film also teaches kids a lot about classical Greek fables. A gem of a film and one that has so far endured past it's 1980's origin to become one of Ray's most memorable.

Clash of the Titans strength lies mainly in the story telling and the great actors in it and the magical creations of the master artist Ray Harryhausen. the ability to create a mythical atmosphere in a fantasy film, which this film succeed to achieve is something rare in these days. another great element is the Musical score, its beautiful and haunting. the powerful cast team of the film is second to none. many critics in the past did not evaluate this film fairly but now after 30 years, the film shows its superiority in comparison to the CGI lifeless films of now days.",Clash of the Titans

However the appalling acting and quite frankly anticlimax ending made me squirm in irritation. Firstly when the kraken is about to eat the princes our main character who is supposed to ""save"" her arrives late, and when he does arrive he gets knocked flat on his backside anyway, leaving it to his ridiculous cuckoo clock of a side kick to save the day!(what the heck does that have to do with the myth anyway??)the acting was poorer than poor, which there is really no excuse for since i have seen plenty of films from the 60s, 70s and 80s which have had great acting, and all of the characters are weak, pathetic and completely unconvincing(check out the scene with the ""hero"" and Medusa comical!)basically it was one of the biggest wastes of my time and certainly not worthy of the title ""classic"" for the sake of your sanity DO NOT WATCH!!!!",Clash of the Titans

There is some value here for analog special effects and linear storytelling but reading jason and the argonauts would probably be as good.

The storyline was well-adapted and written, well yes it has some cheesy moments and for some it was too long but i think it was OK, they knew how to manage the public, it had a lot of suspense and imagination, also is romantic and scary, for example the scene where the head of the statue falls off and opens her eyes, damn is it scary.The acting is great, all the gods have that powerful look and Perseus is also great.The camera is awesome, experimenting and making some complicated takes, using mirrors, beautiful static shots, close ups and large takes following the characters.The illumination is dark and creepy in some times, and in another times its blue and quiet, like a dream, its a important element. The edition also makes some new experiments with the transitions that now may seem cliché, but back then they weren't used a lot.The audio effects are great, because of the sounds of everything and everyone, how the monsters roar and moan, and the music is pretty well chosen for the movie. The visual effects are great, now they look cheap and laughable, but back then; sure it was not impacting or surprising but it was not bad for the time, the models of stop-motion (with the exception of the kraken) are of great design and very detailed, as for the make up, its also great. Now two aspects that were great about this movie were the setting and the costume design it really makes you feel you are in the time the story is developed, its just great, i have no words for it, just... watch it.

The characters are all very memorable, as are the creatures. There is a beauty in simplicity, and that's what I enjoy about the older movies so much.

Even though the special effects are not ""Star Wars"" quality; Ray Harryhausen was the best special effects person there was; by far. He created monsters at a time when there was not the kind of money or technology that we have today. Rick Baker, monster maker, who does the Eddie Murphy movies and Michael Jackson videos is good; and so is John Carpenter; but Harryhausen was and will always be the best in the business.Hey, we know that this is now a real story; but just the fantasy aspects of it is wonderful. I remember seeing this with some of my friends; we were all adults; and we enjoyed it immensely. We got to see Harry Hamlin without a shirt on before he got famous on L.A. Law. We got to see Ursula Anderss (the fabulous 1st Bond girl), British actors Maggie Smith (was in her prime), and Laurence Olivier (finally living out his fantasy of actually being a God). We got to see Burgess Meredith (after the Penguin, but before Rocky). The acting was kind of flat; but it is a fantasy; and based on Greek mythology so anything is possible.This movie taught me not to be vain like Caseopia, don't try to get revenge like Calibos, to be strong and wise in order to find my destiny like Perseus; help others find their destinies and when others fall down; help pick them up like Zeus did Perseus. Make sure that we you know what you are do to and do it well; not letting your circumstances dictate your outcome.That is why I like this movie so much; life lessons are there; you just have to look for them. Also, being judgmental never helped anybody and judging this movie too harshly is a big mistake; there is no cursing; no explicit sex, and is timed just right for a big box of popcorn and soda.

Ursula Andress, despite having only a single line in the whole thing, is beyond exquisite. Good thing, too, since every line in the movie is overblown... because come on people, we're talking Olympian gods and myths here! If, like me, you grew up in the 70s and 80s, this grand operatic gem of a movie gave you a warm fluffy visual treat equivalent to a brownie sundae. Not a nutritious meal, but it left you feeling giddy, slightly overcharged, and ready to believe that syrupy goodness wins out in the end. Handsome hero overcomes seemingly impossible odds, beautiful maiden is swept off her feet by romantic besotted stranger, wise and benevolent adviser offers advice and quips in the background, and all against a backdrop that is as overdone and self-aggrandizing as the acting itself. The music is equally epic and quite hummable when you're stuck in traffic.The entire movie begs you to suspend your disbelief and just accept the story, no matter how awkwardly strung-together it is to those of us who are now sadly spoiled by modern special effects. And it's a sacrifice I make gladly, every time, because like Scully and Mulder I WANT TO BELIEVE. If you were lucky enough to be of an impressionable age when it came out, it made you a believer too.The lurking terror of Medusa's lair, the menace of the Stygian Witches, and the raw overwhelming wish-fulfillment of the whole epic struggle are so charming that the viewer is glad to let go of their adulthood and believe in childish ideals again. Harryhausen delivered monsters that, while not necessarily perfect, were JUST RIGHT for the feeling at hand. A little romantic, perhaps a little forced and silly at times, but isn't that what it's all about? Myths aren't meant to be realistic. That's what makes them myths.Clash of the Titans is a movie version of every child's favorite teddy bear. It may be moth-eaten and grubby by today's standards, but you love that bear anyway and you wouldn't trade it for a thousand new ones. It kept you safe from the monsters under the bed.

163,MovieWatcher1138,Clash of the Blockbusters,9,16 November 2005,"Before I give you my review of Clash of the Titans, I have a confession to make. My appraisal of this film is tainted by nostalgia for the 80's. To anyone who was a kid in the early 80's, Clash of the Titans is a BIG film. It had a marketing campaign comparable to Star Wars. From action figures (including a huge Kraken), to the lunch-box, to the special effects, to the soundtrack, the storybook, etc. This was not the ""crappy"" film at the time that some people seem to think it was now.The actors are excellent in this movie, and the stop motion is the peak of the craft ""before go-motion took hold under Phil Tippet"". If you have kids, show this to them. They will not give a second thought to the animation or the melding of different myths. Nor will they see the acting as hammy. It was a little anachronistic in its photography, as one might place it earlier than the 1980's judging on the color and grain. But this adds to the timeless quality as much as the acting, score and the special effects. The story is very engaging, written in a succession of entertaining action set-pieces connected by drama, and leading to the hero's victory, much like the original Star Wars was structured.Composer Laurence Rosenthal was recommended by John Williams after Williams turned it down due to time considerations. The score is one of the best of the 80's, performed by the London Symphony Orchestra and recorded by Eric Tomlinson who also engineered the original Star Wars recordings. Rosenthal's score puts many of today's adventure scores to shame, and I think it is absurd that he did not rise to meteoric success after this score.I still consider this to be a big classic, even at age 30, and the DVD is a prize in my collection. Coincidentally, this was the first film my wife ever saw in the theater, and was our first date movie. So take that as another confession of nostalgia tainting my review, but know that only a very special movie would be worthy of my reminisce.",Clash of the Titans
164,jhilton-1,Cheesy but fun,7,23 April 2006,"I like mythology and so I enjoyed this movie, it is cheesy but enjoyable. A lot of scenes featured choppy and primitive animation, but at the time Clash was made it was state of the art, I'm sure. As a child I also was terrified of the many beasts and monsters Clash offered. The scene with Medusa is pretty cool, and I love the Krakon. Now that I am older and more schooled in Greek history and in the ways of the world, however, I must confess that I detect and odd homoerotic quality to this film, especially in the relationship between Perseus and Ammon. Perseus spends a lot of time bare-chested, is all I'm saying. I'm not gay, by the way, and I don't think this is a manifestation of a repressed homosexual lust for Harry Hamlin.",Clash of the Titans
165,badact,A Parting Gift from Ray Harryhausen,10,10 October 2001,"I ignored this film when it first came out in 1981. There were just too many cool films to see that year. Friends who saw it told me it was a laughable hoot. Despite it's august cast and attempt to cash in on the mythic quest themes of Star Wars, it rapidly sunk from sight. In 1995, looking for a film appropriate for my 7 year old daughter, I pulled this film out of the 'family' section of my local library. The critics are right. The F/X are clunky, even by 1981 standards.Harry Hamlin is wooden. Judy Bowker is forgettable, and Laurence Olivier hams it up shamelessly...and yet...IT ALL WORKS! The sets and lighting perfectly capture our deepest feellings of mythic Greece. There isn't a drop of contemporary forays into irony & cynicism. It is unalloyed GOOD vs EVIL lovingly given to us by the effects wizard Harryhausen. His monsters have a childlike beauty that makes them 'scary' without trying to gross you out. It's the myth, the quest, and finally the theme that love does conquer all. No need for smart-alecky, eye-winking protaganists. Just a good old fashioned story told straight and true. My now 14yr. old daughter, wife and I just saw it again last night. See it with the child in your life, or the child in you.Thank you Mr. Harryhausen, for this and all your wonderful films.",Clash of the Titans
166,keylargo2,A great Screenplay,10,16 December 2000,"Despite the fact that the film's special effects were not realistic and looked fake and that the film itself looked like a low budget film, the Dialogue and the actions made up for it. What a great script.  The first time I saw this film I was about 11 years old, in 1982.  It was on HBO cable when cable really used a cable and not a wireless remote.  ""there must be a way to defeat the Kraken "" No way known to man, but there might be a way known to women"".... ""To women""?  ""three women?""  The story moved along showing the audience who the characters were and why they were important to Greek Mythology.  Laurence Oliver's performance as Zeus was fantastic.  I only wish I can write a script like this and produce it. I definitely must say this is a classic film.  It's too bad most of the people who were Producers or The director or writer are no longer with us.",Clash of the Titans
167,osasiyoha,YEAR...IT'S A GOD-INCIDENCE,7,18 October 2020,"The bible/scripture communicates in verse 1 of the 49th chapter of the book of Isaiah: ""Listen, O coastlands, to Me, And take heed, you peoples from afar! The Lord has called Me from the womb; From the matrix of My mother He has made mention of My name.""I'm no Perseus, nor is my mother Danae, but considering the fact that I was in THE MATRIX (i.e. womb) of my mother towards the end of 1981 (i.e. the movie YEAR), there's a high likelyhood that I might be the 'Son of Zeus' hinted in Andromeda's riddle about a ""hollow"" 'womb' and two ""full"" 'circles' (i.e. Leto's breasts). There must have been some kind of ""Clash"" in the heavens (i.e. 'Mount Olympus') that resulted in the epic storyline contained in the 1981 Clash Of The Titans.The costumes and settings used were very good and allows one to easily connect the 'gods' of then to the God of 'now'. Very satisfying alignment of Greek Mythology literature with Greek Mythology cinema.Excellent acting by Laurence Olivier in the depiction of Zeus as the all-mighty father of the gods of Olympus. The special effects used for the animals, creatures and monsters are also quite fitting for imaginative contextual depiction of the times and realities of ancient Greece. That is to say Homer (i.e. the author of Homer's Illiad) would be proud to see his written works quite accurately leveraged and visualized.#Ah+KPPO+LO=Apollo🌞",Clash of the Titans
168,jss_wayne,Clash of the Titans Opinion,10,13 November 2006,"i was reading all of the comments written after most people watched ""the clash of the titans""... we watched it as part of the foundation of an assignment in Mythology class. Jeff (the teacher) is a cool laid back guy, and if he ever wanted us to watch a movie, it would be this one. and so he did. we thought it was really cool, mostly because of the faulty graphics and special effects. i liked the movie mostly because there's so much to compare to, titans movie v.s. Greek mythology. i learned a lot off of other sites and this site. its good that there's a site like this, i really took a lot out of this one! anyone who has some more info on movie v.s. Greek myths, let me know. it is greatly appreciated!",Clash of the Titans
169,eliassilveriolykke,It was actually better than The remake,7,26 August 2021,"I liked it because it was good and that it is from the 80s. I liked when pereus fought with medusa, its a good movie.",Clash of the Titans
170,andon2ooo,Great play of Greek mythology.,8,13 July 2002,"Yeah, this may not be the best movie of all time, but I absolutely love the story.  Clash of the Titans is the only movie I have seen that has anything to do with Greek mythology.  This movie relies on pure storyline and history and not on Hollywood glitz and glam.  This movie is an attempt to reconstruct a tale of ancient Greek gods and goddesses using humans as subjects in their divine games.  A modern remake would be great.",Clash of the Titans
171,olauzon,Titans are lame,1,7 August 2010,"I thought this movie was older, so I gave a little bit of credit for the poor special effects. When I saw that it was made in 1981, i remembered Alien, Blade Runner, star wars... and then realized that the SE just sucked. The acting is just SO bad, it's unbelievable! The whole movie dialogue must fit in one page... maybe two. Regarding the story, well, if you wanna learn about Greek mythology, read a book, go on wikipedia, but don't think this is going to reveal all the secret about Zeus, Perseus, and Medusa.I you have some time to kill, or have problem falling asleep, watch this movie...",Clash of the Titans
172,mullac777,A classic Harryhausen cheesfest,7,19 September 2012,"Clash of the Titans! A story of daring adventurers, on the spot romance and cheesy dialogue can be considered a classic but is very much flawed both for better and worse.The setting of Greek mythology opens up a gateway to a whole cast of ""epic"" stop-motion creatures which is Ray Harryhausen's specialty but if you've never tried stop-motion before it may be harder to appreciate his great work which is the best part of this film As for the films weaknesses, it has many. However my biggest complaint is just how dated it feels. It looks and sounds like a film from the 1960's, like another Hausen picture ""Jason and the Argonauts"". The characters are fairly 2-dimensional and the romance sub-plot is a bit confusing with just how silly it is but at the same time it works to the films advantage. Its silly but entertaining, sometimes you'll be laughing your arse off but in a good way. The film doesn't exactly take its self seriously. When it comes down to it the films at its best when there's monsters on the screen, especially one fight with a medusa which blew me away but I won't spoil it, but besides that its not particularly strong in the other categories. I give a strong recommendation nonetheless for just how entertaining it is. If you see it in a shop, don't hesitate to pick it up.",Clash of the Titans
173,sapper7282,Biggest waste of time!,1,7 January 2005,"My wife and I had been really looking forward to this film after seeing the trailer every time we went to the cinema for the best part of a year before the release. Never before had we been so disappointed and never before had the trailer build up for a film so pointedly failed to deliver! The plot clanked. The action creaked. The author tried, unconvincingly, to mix Greek and Nordic mythology.Despite the marvellous, star studded cast, to say the acting was wooden is to insult an oak tree!!! How could they have allowed themselves to be miscast in this way? Even allowing for the pre-digital era of the film, the special effects were VERY jerky! I actually found the old James Cagney's Turkey, The Blood on the Sun MUCH more enjoyable than this!!!",Clash of the Titans
174,prsygrl,The Best Fantasy Movie Of All Time,10,24 April 2005,"I saw Clash of the Titans for the first time in over twenty years. I watched this movie with my ten year old daughter. I was worried she wouldn't enjoy it because she is so used to the CG and Pixar type of effects that are so common in films now. She loved Clash of the Titans. She, too, enjoyed the magic of the story. For me, seeing it again gave me the same feelings of wonderment and awe that I had when I saw it for the first time at the age of eight. The actors, the special effects, and the story draw you to another dimension in time. It's full of wonder, excitement, and magic. We highly recommend this film for anyone who enjoys fantasy or mythology type genre.",Clash of the Titans
175,antfilms,Clash of the Titans needs to be Re-made,10,29 August 2005,"The Original Clash of the Titans is an awesome film and is now what I consider a ""Classic"" especially for my generation. I would love to see this film be re-made using today's special effects standards. and I'm quite sure that there can't be too many of you out there who enjoyed the original film that would disagree if this film were to be re-made with today's new innovations in special effects. It goes without saying that it would have to be done properly(like along the lines of Lord of the Rings Trilogy.) So hopefully the idea is presented to the right people the right way and we can see a new version of this ""Classic"" in the near future.",Clash of the Titans

For some unknown reason this movie has stuck with me since childhood and to this day i can watch it from start to finish without looking away from the screen. Yes it may look corny and fake but this movie just works and the actors excellent performances along with the great audio/visual effects make it a masterpiece in my eyes.In a battle with the newer more technologically advanced Clash of the Titans this one wins hands down in my book and will forever hold a spot in my heart.",Clash of the Titans
178,john-olson,More Clash...More Titans!,8,12 August 2005,"This movie is a wonderful showcase for stop-motion modeling mixed with live-action. By 2005 CGI standards things look a little jerky and unfinished, but this does not distract from drawing the viewer into the world of Greek mythology (commercialized).The Greek gods are butting their jealous heads together and it is up to the pawn in their game, Perseus, to save the day. This is not a movie that will evoke any sort of overwhelming emotional reactions, but it is a competent damsel-in-distress action flick with handsome heroes and ugly bad guys. The lines between good and evil are distinct and predictable.",Clash of the Titans
179,Willrobby121799,Great film for classroom curriculum ages 13-16,7,25 October 2005,"As a teacher of 13-16 year old students of English Literature,this film as been a great asset. Due to the severe budget cuts over the past 25 years in the state of California, our children have limited resources or access to Fine Arts resources. That access assisted my generation in ""putting meat on the bones"" of literature. I often find older films, because of limits placed on nudity, adult situations, and adult language for their era, to be fascinating for this age group to assist and enhance their understanding of literary characters, literary terminology and devices, and story lines. They are an extremely visual generation in the learning process. I am grateful for the assistance this film and others gives my students in advancing their literary skills and encouraging their involvement in the literary process.",Clash of the Titans
