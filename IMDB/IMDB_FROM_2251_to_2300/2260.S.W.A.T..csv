0,Leofwine_draca,Far too slight and predictable to be a good action movie,3,4 January 2017,"Hollywood action films keep on getting made, and the newest, S.W.A.T., is just about indistinguishable from a dozen others of the past two decades. It's a flawed work, with a good concept that is never exploited to the full, which manages to retain a little independent-style charm to stop it being a real dog. Now you see the trailer and hear the premise, about a criminal offering $100 million to anyone who can free him, and you think it sounds like a great excuse for tons of action. Unfortunately, you're wrong. Apart from one street set-piece (complete with guys shooting bazookas from windows) this premise is wasted and things turn into a predictable race against time, complete with traitors, big baddies, and a fair amount of shooting and explosions.It takes an interminable time to get going, with over an hour of exposition before things really start – and it's one of those films with an annoying hip-hop (or whatever) soundtrack that intrudes every five minutes or so. I do credit the screenwriter with lots of attempted characterisation to round out the characters and this does work, to a degree. But Jackson is playing his typical seen-it-all-before character and Rodriguez is the terrible actress she always is. Only Colin Farrell comes away with new credibility under his belt, as his straightforward turn as the lead is very realistic and believable. Nothing to complain about there. LL Cool J is surprisingly good too but he is given nothing to work with in his role as the honest beat cop turned SWAT man.After some okay training sequences and lots of attempted style, the plot begins for real. Slimy French villain Olivier Martinez (just looking at him makes you hate him) is to be transported across the city, but a sniper shoots out his helicopter (cool scene) so they have to go underneath instead. Cue lots of dodgy chases in the dark sewers, so familiar and hardly as good as in BLADE II. The only surprising twist is the idea of a private plane landing on a major bridge at the finale, I did enjoy that conceit. But the following fist-fight between Farrell and the baddie is oh-so-predictable, even the ""cut in half by train"" gag. Now to make this a good film they should have: cut down to 30 minutes of introduction; upped the rating to an R (or 18) and filled it with bloody action; and packed 1 ½ hours with tons of shoot-outs, grenades, bazookas, car chases, bombs, all sorts, I'm talking city-wide carnage from beginning to end. How about the SWAT team surrounded by about two hundred gang members who all want to get Martinez and are chucking Molotov cocktails and attacking them with machetes. Then they should have chucked Martinez in the propeller at the end or run him under the wheel of the plane or maybe machine-gunned him off the bridge. That would have been a GOOD movie.",S.W.A.T.
1,SnoopyStyle,Good popcorn fun,7,17 February 2014,"LAPD SWAT officer Jim Street (Colin Farrell) is an ex-Navy SEAL. When his partner Brian Gamble (Jeremy Renner) disobeyed orders in an armed robbery takedown, Brian gets fired and Jim gets sidelined. Six months later, LAPD is under pressure and veteran SWAT Hondo Harrelson (Samuel L. Jackson) is told to assemble a new SWAT team. Along with some veterans, he picks Jim, Deke (LL Cool J), and Chris Sanchez (Michelle Rodriguez). When French crime boss Alex Montell (Olivier Martinez) gets caught after a routine traffic stop, he tries to escape with an offer of $100 million and SWAT has to stop him.For movies like this, it's all about the action and the gunplay. The good news is that the story passes the smell test. It's not too complicated but it's also not simplistic. The characters are big stereotypes. The actors are all excellent. It's a simple popcorn movie. It does it well. Nothing more.",S.W.A.T.
2,claudio_carvalho,A Predictable Festival of Clichés,6,9 October 2004,"I have just watched S.W.A.T. and I am totally disappointed. Having a huge budget and a fantastic cast, highlighting names like Samuel L. Jackson, Colin Farrell and Michelle Rodriguez, it seems that the producers forgot to buy the most important component of a film: the screenplay. The story is pure cliché, nothing is original and is totally predictable. The writer is probably a fan of Al Pacino. The beginning (the best part of the movie) recalls 'Dog Day Afternoon', followed by 'The Recruit'. The rest is the usual clichés in action / crime movies, with the good and the bad cops, car chases and hits, lots of shootings etc. Although being an action movie, I took some naps along the film, so I used the REW button of the DVD many times. My vote is six.Title (Brazil): 'S.W.A.T. Commando Especial' ('S.W.A.T. Special Command')",S.W.A.T.
3,kosmasp,Simple and fun,7,9 February 2021,"I like the actors involved. I just recently discovered Reed Diamond too. You know one of those actors you recognize but are not sure where you've seen him and what he has done. Now he has just a small role here (which can be considered true about his The Shield stint, though that was a completely different ... kind of short), so this is more a personal thing - might still ring a bell with some here too though.Apart from the short appearance of this guy, we have a bunch of fine actors. But his appearance and almost recruiting does raise a quesion: If he had filled the spot .. then there would not have been a spot open for our main character ... how does that figure? Now that is just one of the many questions you may raise while watching the movie - another one is a bulletproof car towards the end of it, bad guys who conveniently leave barricades in a breakthrough condition and so many more things towards the end that just are able to make you question your own sanity! Don't try to overthink this too much and you'll be able to enjoy the silliness of it all ... also Samuel L. Jackson ... I mean come on! He can't do wrong ... and Ms. Rodriguez ... yes I mentioned the cast. And they are the reason I did rate it a 7 ...",S.W.A.T.
4,jboothmillard,s.w.a.t.,4,20 October 2007,"To be honest, I wasn't paying a lot of attention to this film when I had it on, I think I was drawing, so I wasn't looking up at the screen a lot, so I can't remember all of it. As far as I could see, Jim Street (Colin Farrell) was a skilled police officer who had managed to get himself enrolled into S.W.A.T (Special Weapons and Tactics), but when he did not follow orders with his partner Brian Gamble (Jeremy Renner), Brian faced higher consequence of being taken off the force, but Jim was given another chance. Skilled S.W.A.T. member Sgt. Dan 'Hondo' Harrelson (Samuel L. Jackson) is brought in to train Jim in for the much more extreme circumstances, along with many officers, including Chris Sanchez (Michelle Rodriguez) and Deacon 'Deke' Kaye (LL Cool J). The training was interesting, but then I trailed off with the plot completely, and only caught moments towards the end, including Brian being a villain, and all the villains crashing their plane in the middle of a bridge road. Also starring Josh Charles as T.J. McCabe, Brian Van Holt as Michael Boxer, Olivier Martinez as Alex Montel, Reginald E. Cathey as Lt. Greg Velasquez and Larry Poindexter as Capt. Thomas Fuller. Obviously I'd have to see it again to give a better review and actually see everything, but from what I did see I can see why the critics give it two stars. Okay!",S.W.A.T.
5,rmax304823,Dumb Fun.,5,20 April 2015,"Have you ever seen Errol Flynn's war-time epic ""Desperate Journey""? Flynn and a handful of downed Allied fliers make their way across German and escape through Holland, losing some men but having a laff riot all the way.This urban adventure follows a S.W.A.T. team through its training program and subsequent duels with the underworld, with international terrorists, and with traitors in the ranks but they have a what-the-hell attitude that saves them from gloom.In it's structure, it's really old. Experienced senior sergeant Samuel L. Jackson is brought in to create and shape up a bunch of misfits. Jackson plays it cool though. He's not Georgie Patton kicking butt in North Africa. He's not R. Lee Ermey. He's Samuel L. (for Laidback) Johnson. He laughs along with the boys and promotes their organization at headquarters run by the usual hostile pencil pusher.I don't think I'll describe the plot, which is intricate and sometimes meandering. (I don't know what Colin Farrel's estranged wife is doing in it.) There are some exciting scenes in the L.A. metro underground tunnels and some drainage pipes. I was half expecting them to discover the nest of a giant queen ant and her eggs, but no -- just some bad guys. There are the usual shoot outs, explosions, fireballs, and the deconstruction of multiple cars. I give it extra points because the camera doesn't wobble drunkenly within scenes.If you want distraction, this is it.",S.W.A.T.
6,moonspinner55,Machismo for hire...,3,3 August 2008,"Colin Farrell, looking somewhat small in stature next to the regular he-men in this cast, is blamed for the disaster of a bank-robbery shoot-out between crooks and the S.W.A.T. team. He has a falling out with his S.W.A.T. partner of five years and is punished by working ""the cage"" before ultimately redeeming himself. Despite some amusing nods to the 1970s television show this derives from, ""S.W.A.T."" begins confusingly and doesn't improve much before the formulaic conclusion. Farrell, occasionally forgetting to cover his Australian accent, does however connect with the audience in a direct way; the sequences of him paying his penance are well done, but a quick kiss-off from his girlfriend doesn't leave us with much (which can be blamed on the undernourished script). Every scene with Farrell's superior is a drag--does this guy really want anyone on his side to fail?--but Samuel L. Jackson steps in (thankfully) and gives the proceedings a little juice. Not enough, however, to keep this genre film from slipping right into a dull cycle. *1/2 from ****",S.W.A.T.
7,Quinoa1984,"Pretty baron of brains, and predictable throughout, though it didn't have to be that way...",5,10 August 2003,"There were a few scenes in which I could sense some intelligence seeping through the pores of the acne-ridden scope of this Saturday matinee type of TV adaptation.  The character played by Olivier Martinez (the used book dealer from Unfaithful to refresh memories) had an interesting means of giving a little juice to the film when he shouts right into the cameras ""I will pay $100 million to whoever gets me out of here"".  This almost (almost I mean) brings a bit of thought into the psychology of him, as well as the citizens of Los Angeles that respond in droves at the offer, and for a fleeting few moments between rapid fire from machine guns back and forth, there's an inkling of satire in the whole SWAT team process. 
But, unfortunately, such moments of getting to know these characters, as well as the environment around them, doesn't seem to fit in with the rest of the gung-ho nature of the SWAT team assembled by Samuel L. Jackson's character.  Indeed, director Clark Johnston must have sensed this as well, and thus any kind of output a viewer can get from this movie is in the form of action, action, and more action, despite efforts to build a little on cliche dialog and parts (this goes for supporting roles as well, like the nasty lieutenant, the woman leaving the relationship, the betrayed old partner, etc.)  I didn't feel totally bored watching it till the end, but nothing in it made me feel like watching it again, ever.  It should, however, satisfy it's target audience more than at least a couple of the action efforts to come about this summer.  Grade: C",S.W.A.T.
8,wes-connors,Sealed with a Frisk,5,24 July 2009,"Perfectly coiffed hotshot Colin Farrell (as Jim Street) joins seasoned veteran Samuel L. Jackson (as ""Hondo"" Harrelson)'s Los Angeles S.W.A.T. team; then, the try to escort handsome playboy Oliver Martinez (as Alex Montel) to a federal prison. This is a lot harder than it sounds, since Mr. Martinez has offered $100 million to anyone who can spring him. You can bet on Mr. Farrell's reprimanded former partner Jeremy Renner (as Brian Gamble) will want a piece of the action. Michelle Rodriguez (as Chris Sanchez) plays the expected gal pal cop.There is a lot of ""gay subtext"" in this film, especially in the first half's dialogue. It seems to climax in the scene wherein Farrell not only symbolically, but also literally gives head to Mr. Renner (or visa versa, you figure it out). Then, in a postscript, Martinez is encouraged to have sex in prison. None of it seems to have much of a point, however. This film was based on a 1970s ""S.W.A.T"" TV series, which hasn't been rerun enough for me to check it out. The action in this updated version is very good, but they take too long getting it up.***** S.W.A.T. (8/8/03) Clark Johnson ~ Colin Farrell, Samuel L. Jackson, Jeremy Renner",S.W.A.T.
9,michaelRokeefe,When the going gets tough; the rough get rougher.,5,31 July 2004,"Raucous, explosive, predictable and close to being forgettable. The top LAPD brass wants to repair and polish a tarnished reputation by bringing back from retirement Sgt. ""Hondo"" Harrelson(Samuel L. Jackson)to hand pick a special S.W.A.T. team to take care of extremely dangerous situations. The last picked, but most impressive officer is Jim Street(Colin Farrell)whose swagger has put him in hot water with the powers that be. Also on the squad is Chris Sanchez(Michelle Rodriguez)who has already been turned down for S.W.A.T. duty just because she is female. She is one tough babe that can more than carry her share of the load. The team gets assigned to transfer the head of a notorious European crime cartel Alex Montel(Oliver Martinez) to a Federal lockup. He has just murdered his uncle, but is arrested for a missing tail light on his uncle's car. Hell breaks loose when Montel looks into a news camera and claims to give $100 million to anyone who can set him free. A routine transfer turns into an all out war fighting off several different factions greedy for the crime boss' money. The twisting climax proves there can be a scumbag among collective honor. The special effects are entertaining and far better than the some times stupid dialogue. Farrell and Jackson more or less carry the movie; not to over look the winsome Rodriguez. Also in the cast are: Jeremy Renner, Larry Poindexter, Josh Charles and rapper LL Cool J. Watch for Steve Forrest who played ""Hondo"" Harrelson in the mid 70s TV series. He has a small role as a S.W.A.T. truck driver. I seriously doubt this movie causing any change in anyone's view of the LAPD.",S.W.A.T.
10,hitchcockthelegend,Competent actioner.,6,21 June 2013,"S.W.A.T. is neither here nor there, in that if it was made ten years earlier it would in all probability be better thought of. The problem is that there is such a long line of action movies that entertain without pushing the boat out, some, like S.W.A.T., throw a good cast list at it and hope that carries the film through, others just go over the top with the pyrotechnics and think that is job done. Abandon hope of something fresh and exhilaratingly kinetic and S.W.A.T. passes muster.The plot of S.W.A.T. basically sees Samuel L. Jackson put in charge of a crack team of five cops with attitude and guts. Their main mission, after all the training and baring out of character's respective traits and psychological make-ups, is to ensure an imprisoned drug kingpin doesn't get broken out of jail after said scum-bag offers a huge cash reward to anyone that can break him out of said police custody. Cue crash, bangs, double-crosses and a face from the past coming back into the picture after being telegraphed by an incident that opens the film.Along with Sam are Colin Farrell, Michelle Rodriguez, LL Cool J, Josh Charles and Brian Van Holt. Oliver Martinez slips into the slimy villain shoes and Jeremy Renner does another one of his unhinged characterisations. Director Clark Johnson never breaks free of his TV roots, because the film often feels like a glorified TV episode, but his action construction is competent and he has decent actors to keep the film from sinking down among the dead men. Competent is the key word here, it's a decent time waster for the action movie fan, but really it feels like the action movie hadn't advanced much from the previous decade. A shame because there was much potential in the story. 6/10",S.W.A.T.
11,Theo Robertson,Very Journeyman Type Of Action Thriller,5,7 February 2010,"There's something slightly cynical and needless about this film since it's based upon a television series that probably most famous for its theme tune and title sequence , or rather most famous in American since the show wasn't networked in Britain and would only occasionally turn in the regional TV schedules at 11.35 pm just before close down Director Clark Johnson directs in a very journeyman style seen commonly in most American thrillers this decade . Perhaps the criticism is that it's a little bit too journeyman . Everything is rapidly edited and when there's any type of action there's a booming , intrusive soundtrack every time there's something vaguely action packed happening on screen . It's more MTV than Sam Peckinpah It's something of a backhanded compliment to Johnson that he makes the illusion that there's more happening on screen than there actually is . . The plot itself is very thread bare of "" International criminal gets caught and publicizes a $100 million reward to who busts him out of custody "" . This plot doesn't actually come to the fore until halfway through the running time . Until then we're introduced to the characters such as former navy SEAL , tough Latina and vegetarian , and being an action thriller characterization isn't a priority for the movie As the plot takes off we're treated to car chases , explosions and traitors in the police force which reminds you more of DIE HARD 2 than the original TV series . The story telling also suffers from these little lapses of logic where the bad guys kill minor characters who get in their way but when it's one of the major characters they merely whallop them over the head . All in all a very journeyman type of thriller",S.W.A.T.
12,jotix100,L.A. subways,6,3 October 2003,"One wonders if the making of the Los Angeles subway system has been ordered by Hollywood, as more and more films are being shot in it lately. Before it was The Italian Job, now, it is S.W.A.T. Is there a metaphor? Let the viewer decide and interpret.Clark Johnson has recruited a very interesting team to play the SWAT team, led by Samuel L. Jackson. His Hondo is a man that has seen it all and he takes no nonsense from his men. He takes a chance with Jim, who is damaged goods, because of a previous incident caused by his partner. Colin Farrell is very effective in his role of the wronged guy who is trying to redeem himself. The rest of the team is OK.They are all in this together to fight the villain, Alex Montel, played by Olivier Martinez. Why is Mr. Martinez shown always in such an unkempt way? One can almost 'smell' him... Obviously, he will never be a spokesperson for any men's fragrance in his native country. He needs an image consultant to get out of the bad guy stereotype that Hollywood has given him.The special effects, specially the Lear Jet landing at the bridge, are spectacular. The end is predictable as we know who is going to come out the winner.As summer films go, this was entertaining, even though it doesn't add anything new to the genre.",S.W.A.T.
13,preppy-3,Just about what you'd expect,6,9 August 2003,"""S.W.A.T."" was a by the numbers TV cop show from the 70s.  It only lasted one season and its only claims to fame are that it had a young Robert Urich in its cast and had a really catchy theme song.  The movie isn't much better than the show but it's not a total washout.Jim Street (Colin Farrell) and his partner Gamble (Jeremy Renner) are part of SWAT and on a mission.  Gamble ignores a direct order and a hostage is wounded.  Gamble is fired from SWAT and Street is sent to cage duty.  Six months later Lt. Dan ""hondo"" Harrelson (Samuel L. Jackson) starts to head SWAT.  He puts Street back on along with a few others (the only standout is LL Cool J) and they go into training.  Then a vicious French killer (horribly played by Olivier Martinez) raises hell in L.A. and SWAT may have more than they can handle on their hands.As you can see this is, plotwise, an hour-long TV cop show extended to 2 hours.  Ever twist and turn was boringly predictable.  And we have too loud rock songs played over all the action sequences along with ear-splitting gun shots.  Also there's tons of casual violence but no blood and gore (maybe that's how it got by with a PG-13) and a surprising amount of swearing (thank you ""NYPD Blue"").  Still, the dialogue wasn't half bad; the action sequences were quick, loud and full of energy and everybody gives a good performance (especially Farrell and Jackson).So, it's nothing new...but you could do worse.  Not a film for small kids though.",S.W.A.T.
14,poolandrews,"Watchable big budget Hollywood action, passes the time I suppose.",5,13 February 2011,"S.W.A.T. is set in Los Angeles & starts as S.W.A.T. team partners Jim Street (Colin Farrell) & Brian Gamble (Jeremy Renner) disobey direct orders to storm a bank where gunmen are holding several hostages at gunpoint, although they manage to save the hostages their boss Captain Fuller (Larry Poindexter) sacks Gamble & demotes Street. Six months later & S.W.A.T. veteran Sergeant Dan 'Hondo' Harrelson (Samuel L. Jackson) is brought in by Fuller to train a new elite S.W.A.T. team, Hondo gets to choose his new team & picks Street to be in it after being impressed with his record, knowledge & ability. Meanwhile international drug smuggler, thief & killer Alex Montel (Olivier Martinez) is arrested in LA on a technicality but his true identity is soon discovered. Looking at a life sentence Montel offers one hundred million dollars to anyone who can free him, Hondo & his newly trained S.W.A.T. team have the task of making sure Montel doesn't escape while being transported to a federal prison...This big budget action thriller remake of the television series S.W.A.T. (1975) which ran for thirty seven episodes over two seasons was directed by Clark Johnson & I must admit I had never heard of the television series before or even know anyone who has let alone actually watched an episode of it so I cannot compare this film with the series, what I can compare this film with though are other big budget action thrillers & I have to say that while S.W.A.T. isn't terrible it's nothing more than average. The script seems like two different ideas slung together, the first hour or so of S.W.A.T. focuses on the team themselves, their recruitment & training with all the usual clichés like bad blood between a couple of the members, ones a black guy for racial purposes & ones a woman while one has something to prove &, of course, there's the team leader who is deliberately very matey with his lads. The character's are thin, none of them get more than a few lines & no-one is given much background although there are one or two one-liners & the film never seems to take itself that seriously. Then for the final hour the improbable plot kicks in as everyone tries to spring international crime lord Montel & get their hands on his one hundred million dollar reward, I can't believe that the television reporters covering the story would publicise his offer so much even to the extent where they say how much he is worth & therefore implying he is good for the money! The last hour or so moves like a rocket & while it may lack a big set-piece action scene there are still plenty of shoot-outs, car chases, explosions, fights, near misses & even a plane landing on a bridge. The pace of the film almost makes you forget how silly & empty it all is, the lack of procedure, Montel only getting a three man escort, a bullet proof limo catching up with a leer-jet & Street throwing away his loaded gun to go man on man with Gamble at the end despite being badly injured (I would consider a knife shoved through your hand as a serious injury) but overall S.W.A.T. is a shallow film that has a certain amount of big budget appeal & fun while it lasts although I would struggle to call it anything other than alright.The film looks very polished & pretty taking in some of the nicer Los Angeles locations (the Sheriff's bus full of prisoners even drives down Sunset Boulevard) with impressive skyscrapers, beaches & nice areas, maybe a grittier approach would have been better? I was a little disappointed in the set-pieces, while there's enough of them none are that memorable or big. There are some shoot-outs, some exploding cars & fights but not much else. The main set-piece is probably the jet landing on the bridge which is cool enough I suppose. The violence is fairly tame in a PG sort of way, there's not much profanity either so there are no foul mouthed one-liners which is a shame when you have an actor like Samuel L. Jackson who can deliver them as good as anyone. The style of the film is mixed, there's the occasional shaky hand-held camcorder look although most the of the film is shot in a way you can understand what's going on. The loud & obnoxious music that is used throughout irritated me & felt out of place with several terrible songs.With a supposed budget of about $70,000,000 this was actually filmed in Los Angeles at the same time The Italian Job (2003) & Hollywood Homicide (2003) were. The acting is alright, Colin Farrel is OK but doesn't get much to work with while I am sick of Michelle Rodriguez in tough bad ass roles, rapper LL Cool J plays one of the S.W.A.T. team while Samuel L. Jackson is always watchable.S.W.A.T. is a routine big budget Hollywood action film that doesn't hold up to any scrutiny at all, based on an obscure television series I am not sure if this is in the same spirit or not but there are better action films out there. Not bad by any means but not particularly great either. I suppose it passes the time but leaves little impression.",S.W.A.T.
15,dbborroughs,Good action film,6,20 January 2008,"The Big Screen version of the small screen cult favorite is a pretty good thriller. No, its not the best movie in the world but a good way to spend two hours. The plot concerns a wanted international criminal who offers 100 million to anyone who will spring him. The action is mostly realistic as are the characters. The real complaint is that the captain is too much of an ass and there are one or two bumps that don't ring true, especially at the end but its not anything that will spoil the fun. Best of all there are a couple of really good action sequences.Recommended, especially on cable",S.W.A.T.
16,Calicodreamin,Meh,5,31 January 2021,An all star cast but not that impressive of a movie. The plot was pretty basic and the twist could be seen coming a mile away. Decent acting and action coordination.,S.W.A.T.
17,Boba_Fett1138,Disappointingly bad.,4,14 May 2005,"OK I didn't expected this movie to be an action-masterpiece, just a little fun entertaining movie to kill some time with, a typical 6 out of 10 movie if you know what I mean but the movie was just disappointingly bad.The first 50 minutes just feel pointless and the story doesn't seem to go anywhere. Reason why the first 50 minutes don't really work out is because of the characters that are simply not interesting enough. At about 1 hour and 10 minutes in the movie the movie finally gets a bit interesting but than comes the final which is only just mainly disappointing again, also thanks due to some very poor editing.The editing in general was just mainly poor in this movie and so was the cinematography. The lighting was nice and so was the atmosphere but the movements and camera angles were totally wrong. Nothing in the movie really works out as it was supposed to, the story, the cinematography, the music (obviously the movie tries to create a realistic atmosphere, which makes the 'hip' musical score by Elliot Goldenthal a weird and unfitting choice.), the acting, the characters...nothing really works out an 100%. And what was with Olivier Martinez his accent? Oh boy, that was irritating. And I had no idea that getting a knife through airport customs was so easy, especially after 9/11. I don't think director Clark Johnson is a person we will hear an awful lot about in the future.Only good thing is the nice atmosphere of the movie that has Los Angeles written all over it. Also some of the action is nice but the poor editing doesn't really make it spectacular or memorable. Even action movie fans will be disappointed with it.4/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",S.W.A.T.
18,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,"An average action movie, nothing more nothing less",7,12 January 2004,"S.W.A.T. is pretty much by the book as far as regular action movies go, nothing really new to offer, it's just entertainment. I guess the best thing it has going for it, is all the big names; Samuel L. Jackson, LL Cool J, Colin Farrel & Michelle Rodriguez. Pretty much each of them play their roles well, and their characters are convincing. The script is pretty good, considering it's a simple action movie, and it keeps you thoroughly entertained throughout the entire run time(and the idea isn't bad, and it seems original enough). The climax is good. Most of the action scenes are well-made and exciting, and the character development(though there wasn't a lot of it) is pretty decent for an action movie... and for a movie based on a television show, this wasn't bad. Something that I was a bit annoyed at(and some will definitely hate it) was the amount of one-liners. Sometimes, I almost forgot I wasn't watching an Arnie movie; every single main character has at least one one-liner, and about half of them aren't really funny, they're just annoying and misplaced. The only other thing I can complain about in this movie was the PG-13 age limit; I think they should have made it a bit more violent and just went for an R-rating. Overall, pretty good. 7/10",S.W.A.T.
19,view_and_review,S.W.A.T.: Such a Wasted Acting Team,5,27 March 2007,"For an ""action"" film, S.W.A.T. was largely uneventful. The movie certainly had enough well known faces to help sell it, but even though the cast consisted of household names, they seemed uninspired and lack-lustre. As for the the movie, it consisted mostly of development and build up before the final climatic sequence we had been waiting the entire movie for. Considering we had to wade through S.W.A.T. recruiting and training before we got to see them in action, the action was weak. I was expecting a ""Heat"" type standoff or something similar, or some type of battle using the full extent of their tactical weaponry and skills. It all basically boiled down to a life or death game of three card monte.",S.W.A.T.
20,neil-476,Quite good,7,7 February 2010,"S.W.A.T. is a perfectly serviceable action thriller of the old school.Complete with unfairly disgraced operatives put into a Suicide Dquad type scenario, together with an obnoxious idiot commanding officer, there are no great surprises but a fair amount of predictability. But this doesn't matter too much as the thing skitters along on its pre-ordained course, failing to surprise, but entertaining nonetheless.The squad members are all well cast, and Sam Jackson leads in the way that only he can.There is no bad language (in the version I saw on broadcast TV) and the violence, though frequent, isn't very explicit.And it's quite good fun - it remembers that it is supposed to be entertaining.",S.W.A.T.
21,anaconda-40658,No SWAT Can Save This.,3,1 September 2015,"S.W.A.T. (2003): Dir: Clark Johnson / Cast: Colin Farrell, Samuel L. Jackson, Michelle Rodriguez, LL Cool J, Olivier Martinez: Here is yet the umpteenth film based on previous material that fails to transcend to the big screen because it is pure sh*t. The title represents teamwork, which was done in order to throw this junk out there and take credit for absolutely nothing. The setup involves a robbery gone wrong and the quick thinking of two S.W.A.T. officers that save a hostage. Colin Farrell is put in job reduction and betraying his trigger happy partner. Enter Samuel L. Jackson as S.W.A.T. commander whose duty is to recruit five officers. Central plot regards a captured criminal being transported until the operation goes severely wrong when he announces on TV millions of dollars to anyone who can spring him out of jail. Written with skill of a third grader. To its credit it gives insight into S.W.A.T. operations thanks to sharp directing by Clark Johnson. Farrell, Jackson, LL Cool J, and Michelle Rodriguez play out roles that may be recruits from every crime drama and action film ever made. Olivier Martinez plays a drug lord and that pretty much sums up his involvement. There are many stereotypes but that is hardly a surprise since nobody here seems to contain any original character. Well made yet familiar action film that should be swatted...with a sledge hammer. Score: 3 / 10",S.W.A.T.

The unit Captain who's more concerned about how this affects him, wants to make them sacrificial lambs. But instead has them reassigned to the gun cage. The Captain knows that Gamble was the one who decided to do it and offers Street the opportunity to say so in exchange for being placed back on S.W.A.T. but Street refuses. Six months later Hondo Harrelson, a team leader who doesn't get along with the Captain is brought back to form a new unit. He chooses some present S.W.A.T.

After training, they get a major job, getting a Crime Lord to prison but he has offered a 100 million dollars to anyone who can bust him out.....It's one of those films that sounds like a good idea, has a good trailer and one sheet, but overall the end product is watchable, but nothing significant.After seeing for a second time, you realise that the film is nothing more than a series of montages, and one liners, with a couple of members reminding the audience that they have kids.The cast are all watchable, Farrell and Jackson obviously stand out, with Rodriguez there for girl power, and Cool J there for the ladies.The plot involving Martinez feels like a little sub plot, and the script reminds us that he is offering the money every now and again, so the audience again doesn't forget.It ends with a bang, and literally half an hour after its finished, the only thing I can remember of the film was Farrell vomiting while he was working out.It's okay, nothing more.",S.W.A.T.

Samuel Jackson, playing Sgt. Hondo, leads a swat team that is charged with transporting an arrested drug kingpin into federal custody. They must contend with other criminals who have been offed a hundred million dollars to anyone who can spring him from his confinement. The problem with the film is that it's horribly clichéd, so much so that one can't help but feel a strong sense of deja-vu throughout.

S.W.A.T. is pure fun and escapism for any time of the day. Even if you haven't seen the TV series upon which this fine movie is based, it's still definitely worth watching and demands our attention.Clark Johnson is an actor I recall from his impressive performance in one of my favorite series, Homicide: Life on the Street.

25,The_Void,S.W.A.T. a load of rubbish,4,2 October 2005,"You cant go into a film like S.W.A.T. with anything resembling high expectations; but you can go in expecting to be entertained - and this film doesn't even deliver on that implied promise. Sure, it has all the explosive action sequences you will have come to expect from this sort of tosh, but because the characters and script are so lame; it takes all the fun out of them. Roughly half of the dialogue in this flick is made up of smart-ass quips delivered in the typical 'cool' aggressive way, and it makes it very hard to take seriously down to the fact that people simply don't talk to each other like this in real life. I realise that this is 'just a film', but being unrealistic makes it hard to connect with. The story is typical of this sort of film, and it sees a rich jailbird offering loads of money to whoever can spring him from jail. It's lucky, then, that S.W.A.T. are on hand to save the day! (groan). The film handles it's plot badly, however, as it takes ages to get into it and most of the early stages of the film are taken up by boring training and recruitment scenes, which are filled out by more rubbish dialogue.The cast is marginally impressive, with Colin Farrell in the lead, and being supported by LL Cool J, Michelle Rodriguez and Samuel L. Jackson. Jackson is, of course, the standout as he's the best actor on the cast list; but he really needs to start reviewing the material he's going to be working with. There's no doubt that he can carry a bad movie like this; but his talents would be better off elsewhere. Colin Farrell is overrated, annoying and never convinces as the hardman he's trying to portray. The action sequences are thick and fast once they finally kick off, but again it's the dialogue and the characters that spoil it. Adding to that is the predictability of this film and all of it's counterparts. The fact that you know it's going to be a Hollywood style 'happy' ending really spoils the proceedings. Especially when most people will be hoping that our heroes will end up biting the bullet, due to the fact that they're all underwritten, boring and never say anything isn't a quip. On the whole, this film is garbage and I don't recommend it. If you're easy to please or just like films that don't require any input from the viewer, however, you may find something here.",S.W.A.T.
26,=G=,Just more mindless Hollywood action,5,30 December 2003,"""S.W.A.T."" uses L.A. SWAT ops as an excuse for this messy conglomeration of action nonsense none of which is sufficiently original, creative, or unique to make the mind-numbing excesses worth wading through. You'll see lots of flying brass and lead, crashes, stunts, etc. but nothing you haven't seen before. All that in the absence of a human story with too much cost-conserving  filler and busyness adds up to a no-brainer action flick best saved for broadcast. Recommended for police action junkies only.

27,MovieAddict2016,"It's not a great movie, but given the other awful TV show remakes abounding the film market, you could certainly do worse than S.W.A.T.",7,5 December 2005,"People are often complaining about Hollywood these days, saying how commercialized and greedy it's become over the years, and how the quality of films such as ""Citizen Kane"" and ""Casablanca"" are long forgotten. It's true. The most pertinent proof that Hollywood is running out of original ideas is the fact that film executives are constantly giving the thumbs up to remakes of old 60s and 70s TV shows like ""The Brady Bunch"" and ""Charlie's Angels."" Next year we're all going to be sitting through ""Bewitched"" with Nicole Kidman and Will Ferrell. The question is: Does ""Bewitched"" even need a remake?That's not to say that there aren't original writers out there. Having written a fair share of film screenplays myself, and having read many others, the supply of original scripts is quite high. The demand is not. It's sad when quality films are passed for big-budget extravaganzas with not an ounce of thought and given the green light simply because some overweight pen pusher is considering the zeros.""SWAT"" is a breath of fresh air from the typical TV show remakes. It's not one of the best films in recent memory, but it's not nearly as clichéd or goofy as I had imagined before going to see it. In fact, it's surprisingly gritty - more like an R-rated movie than a PG-13.The film stars Colin Farrell as Jim Street. In the beginning, Jim is taking part in a routine hostage situation. At first it's being controlled by the police, but then matters become desperate. ""Call in the SWAT,"" a cop says over a radio transmission, and then we see Jim and his five-year partner, Gamble (Jeremy Renner), giving their best efforts.Gamble injures a hostage with a shot he wasn't supposed to take, though, and Jim and Gamble are reprimanded. Gamble is thrown off the force and Jim is reassigned to the lowly life of a SWAT weapons expert. Six months go by, and Sgt. Dan ""Hondo"" (Samuel L. Jackson) gives his machine gun to Jim, who does a great job tweaking around with it. And, as if by luck, Dan is assigned to put together a new SWAT team. He chooses Jim, based on his weapon skills; Chris Sanchez (Michelle Rodriguez), a tough lady; T.J. McCabe (Josh Charles), the wimpy guy; Michael Boxer (Brian Van Holt), Jim's enemy on the force; and Deke (LL Cool J), a fast runner, as proved in his introductory sequence.After the routine training scenes, the action jumpstarts when a foreign kingpin, Alex Montel (Olivier Martinez) comes to town in hopes of making a name for himself. But that doesn't happen - much to the audiences' surprise - because Alex is arrested for a broken tail light and thrown in jail.That's how the trouble starts. Alex offers a high payment to anyone who can break him out of jail - and during a prisoner transport, this happens, headed by Gamble and his cronies. Jim and co. are sent after the ex-SWAT member and his gang, in hopes of taking them down before Alex gets out of the country and so on and so forth.Sounds pretty standard, right? It is. But the film is directed by Clark Johnson in a distinctly grainy style, reminiscent of ""Training Day,"" only a bit softer. And the script doesn't resort to clichés all that often - when you think there's going to be a car chase, or a big shoot-out, nothing happens. Which is actually quite a relief, despite the fact that some audiences may have been expecting something a little bit...more.Colin Farrell is doing exactly what he did in ""The Recruit,"" acting smart and tough. Michelle Rodriguez is starting to stereotype herself after such flicks as ""The Fast and the Furious"" and ""Resident Evil,"" playing tough women in both films, but I suppose that's all she really can play.The actor who really surprised is an actor who's been around for quite some time: Samuel L. Jackson. Jackson is enjoyable, as usual, as the guy who knows everything - a role that usually fits him. But he steals the show from the other actors with his sly coolness that he displayed in ""Pulp Fiction.""""SWAT"" isn't as goofy as you think it's going to be. It's also not as action-packed as you might expect. If you want another ""Die Hard"" rip-off, look elsewhere. ""SWAT"" is, surprisingly, a pretty smart and character-driven action movie that never resorts to the typical action film clichés.It's not a great movie, but given the other awful TV show remakes abounding the film market, you could certainly do worse than ""SWAT.""",S.W.A.T.

29,Buddy-51,efficient cop film,6,5 July 2005,"Loosely based on the TV series of the same name, ""S.W.A.T."" is an entertaining, if essentially formulaic, police procedural set on the ribboned thoroughfares and sizzling pavements of metropolitan Los Angeles. Samuel L. Jackson plays an LAPD veteran called back to the force to handpick and train a crack SWAT team made up of promising neophyte recruits. Colin Farrell, LL Cool J and Michelle Rodriguez are the actors who make up part of that team.The creators of ""S.W.A.T."" have done a pretty decent job given the limitations of the genre. It's true that the plot is standard issue stuff for the most part and the characters have little opportunity to distinguish themselves and develop. However, the dialogue is frequently crackling and the performers go through the motions with seriousness and conviction. The action scenes are also well handled, even if they do go a bit overboard from time to time, a problem endemic to virtually all action films these days, not just this one.Chances are you probably won't remember a thing about ""S.W.A.T."" much past its closing credits, but it's a fun enough ride while you're watching it.",S.W.A.T.
30,bowmanblue,"Just big, dumb (action) fun",7,21 February 2019,"I've watched 'S.W.A.T.' so many times and enjoyed it every last one of them. No, that's not me saying that it's a classic film and worthy of future study - it's just fun (if you're into action/co-related films).Back when Colin Farrell was being touted as someone who could headline a big-budget Hollywood movie, he plays the (overly-macho named, in my opinion) Jim Street - a no nonsense S.W.A.T. team member in L.A. who steps over the line during a high-stakes hostage mission and gets chewed out by his superior (the way all on-screen cop-heroes seem to do at one stage or another!). He's sent to the 'gun cage' for his actions, i.e. taken off active duty while his former partner (played by Jeremy Renner) is just let go from the force.However, Farrell is soon recruited by Nick Fury (or at least the L.A. S.W.A.T. team's version of our favourite Marvel SHIELD leader), or at least he's recruited by Samuel L Jackson, who has to come up with a 'Dirty Dozen-like' bunch of police misfits for... well, something. It doesn't matter. What does matter is that Jackson assembles a bit of a early 2000s ensemble cast, including Michelle Rodriguez and LL Cool J in order to make sure the bad-guy Alex Montel (Olivier Martinez - an actor who I only knew because he was once dating Kylie Minogue!) stays in chains. Little do they know how many people want to bust him out for a decent price!One minor gripe is that because Alex Montel is behind bars throughout much of the movie, there's never really much chance for him to interact with our heroes. Instead, the bulk of the film is about the cops and their struggle to overcome their own demons and get along. There may be another bad guy for them to deal with, but, on the off-chance you can't guess who that might be when you sit down to watch, I won't spoil it. Anyway, that's just a minor gripe. Ultimately, what you have here is an action-packed cop-version of the 'Dirty Dozen' where the above bunch of misfits have to conquer their own differences for the greater good (and bust a fair few bad-guys while they're at it).So, if you're looking for plenty of action and wise cracks, this should suitable quench your thirst of a style of action movie that would probably be more at home in the nineties rather than 2003. It's definitely a good time, but just don't bother with its sequel, as it doesn't carry on the cast's stories and isn't even nearly worthy of the 'S.W.A.T.' name.",S.W.A.T.

There's the climax setup. Samuel L. Jackson plays the SWAT team's leader. Colin Farrell plays the exceptionally talented member of the team, which is the main character of the movie. LL Cool J and Michelle Rodriguez, as a tough female cop, round out the cast. The climax is too long, but at least the action isn't insulting to sensibility.

34,CuriosityKilledShawn,Dumb and not entertainingly dumb either,1,5 March 2005,"Ugh! SWAT is a miserable film. I remember when I was a kid and I'd play at Cops and Robbers with other kids. We'd run around with invisible guns indiscriminately shooting at each other. SWAT has that same mentality and is aimed at the same age group. It's not a movie, it's shamefully disguised pro-NRA propaganda. For all the gun glorification and random violence (PG-13 rated violence remember, as they want to expose this drivel to the little kiddies) there is not one subtle moment that tells us guns are dangerous. Here they are just toys and shooting people is just fun.I shouldn't really complain so hard as for the first whole hour of this film NOTHING happens. It's all devoted to pointless character building which never rises past clichéd stereotypes (Michelle Rodriguez expands her range by playing an unhappy, scowling Latino-something she hasn't played before) and is totally ditched with the abrupt, anti-climatic ending.SWAT promises action and the not-quite high concept plot of a crime-lord offering anyone who can break him out of custody a $100 million reward is never fully realised. We could have had 2 whole hours of excitement but we barely get 45 minutes. It's a slow, boring film with absolutely NOTHING to recommend it. Plus it all seems very 70's.

The S.W.A.T. was apparently designed from a movie formula and the twists and turns were projected way ahead of time. Not a terrible movie, but not that much interesting either. No character development, except the usual cliches, no real depth to relationships, just scenes just for the sake of scenes (picked up probably from some other movie outline. I found the trailers before the movie more involving, more action oriented. Just didn't seem like an intelligent, innovative movie - it just uses the S.W.A.T. premise and makes it into the same police action I've seen before.

37,The-Sarkologist,"When you need something done properly, give it to the stuff-ups",4,25 December 2011,"The first thing I saw when I was looking over this film in IMDb was a conversation entitled '100 things I learnt from this movie'. Okay, they had only come up to 40 points (and I am not really going to add any more to it) but when you see something like that it is suggestive that this film borders on the edge of an unrealistic cookie-cutter Hollywood film, which is basically what it is. Okay, I cannot say whether it is possible to land a Lear Jet on the 6th Street Bridge, since I have never been to Los Angeles, however I sort of fall into the category of thinking that it is doubtful, unless you are a really good pilot.Anyway, the film opens up, as expected in a film like this, with a SWAT team stuffing up and wounding a civilian simply because one of the officers is a little too trigger happy. As such they are demoted and one of them is assigned to 'The Cage' namely the weapons locker. Later, a stuff-up is called in to raise a SWAT team of stuff-ups, and so he goes and gets a group of stuff-ups, which includes a woman, and the demoted SWAT officer, and begins to train his team.It is noticeable that, as always happens, when a couple of officers are put to the commander, he objects, but after about a minute of arguing, he relents, which in and of itself, seems a little unrealistic. After their training, we learn that an international criminal is arrested because of a broken tail light. I really don't know about the US, but here in Australia, broken tail-lights are hardly ever picked up, let alone the driver of the car being arrested for him. However, when the state discovers that he is an international criminal, all hell breaks lose.First of all, the criminal offers $100 million to whoever breaks him out of gaol. My first question when is said is, was, is he good for the money. My immediate impression was, doubt it. However, it is noticeable how crazy the entire city becomes over this money, to the point that a convey of police is ambushed by a criminal organisation in the centre of the city, which quickly turns into a warzone. It is noticeable that despite the police being outnumbered and outgunned, they still manage to win. Further, while the US is well known for its liberal gun laws, I simply found that this gunfight in the middle of the city to be bordering on the unrealistic.Finally, out of all of the teams that could have been selected to transport the prisoner, they chose the stuff-ups. Why on Earth would the police force entrust such a delicate operation to a group that they have little to no faith in. It just does not seem to work for me. Then, they easily cave into the prisoner's offer (or at least one of them does) and the team is left to clean up the mess. Oh, and I note that the Los Angeles subway was strangely empty. Okay, late at night in Berlin their subways were also mostly empty, but it is a very rare sight in the major cities that I have been to, though I suspect that Los Angeles, being a city reliant on cars than on public transport, would make it a bit more believable.",S.W.A.T.

40,Floated2,Run of the mil action film,6,23 April 2019,"S.W.A.T is as one would expect giving the plot synopsis and overall theme. The film starts off with Jim Street (Colin Farrell) and his partner Gamble (Jeremy Renner) being part of SWAT and on a mission. Gamble ignores a direct order and a hostage is wounded. Gamble is fired from SWAT and Street is sent to cage duty. Six months later Lt. Dan ""Hondo"" Harrelson (Samuel L. Jackson) starts to head SWAT. He puts Street back on along with a few others (the only standout is LL Cool J) and they go into training. Then a vicious French killer (Olivier Martinez) corrupts in L.A. and SWAT may have more than they can handle on their hands.There isn't nothing that original or special about the film, but it does provide some decent action scenes. The ending finale was also a nice touche as it wasn't completely predictable, and the action does deliver down late. Other than that, SWAT does fulfill for some action fans but don't expect a great story film with much suspense of thrills..",S.W.A.T.
41,johnnyboyz,Good for what it is but some aspects are really let down by the fact it's aimed at twelve year olds.,6,22 April 2007,"People may dismiss S.W.A.T. as one of those films that stands there on its own as pure entertainment for the average film going Joe and overall, they'd be right to do so. You don't need me or anyone else to tell you that this film is indeed a bit of light-hearted fun that most people can enjoy but what struck me was that more popular 'fun' films such as Snakes on a Plane and Pirates of the Caribbean didn't do as much for me as S.W.A.T. did and this makes me think that S.W.A.T. is a tad underrated, albeit as a popcorn fest.The films spends enough time early on hanging around the main character of Jim Street; a disgraced ex-S.W.A.T. member whose partner got them both into a little trouble a few years ago when he made a bit of a botch of a hostage situation. Although Street is played by Colin Farrell whose one of those actors most people have a love/hate relationship with (although it's probably mostly females who fit into the 'love' category) so it's always going to be a little tricky to associate with the fact Farrell is the focus of the film, character wise.One scrap of 'cred.' the film has is its inclusion of Samuel L. Jackson as the boss of a newly formed S.W.A.T. team following his return to the force although he gets his own way far too easily during the forming of the team, in my opinion. His search takes control after the good opening and what was effective was that genuinely funny humour as well as decent action/chase scenes are both blended in to the search. We're also introduced to the dangers of law enforcement as Michelle Rodriguez's character tells us when she exclaims she was attacked by a guy three times her size and weight wielding several small sharp razor blades.What makes S.W.A.T. the piece of fun, colloquial film-making it is; is its evidence of light heartedness all the way through. In the UK where I come from, the film was rated as a '12A' which means twelve year olds can see it; as long as there's a parent/guardian with them. The reason for this is its lack of violence and genuine, gritty police action. The chase and action scenes, although impressive, are done in a routine manner with fast talking, joke-style dialogue there to extinguish any threat of profanity or violence for the kids. Also, the music is a cause for concern. I have no idea of the bands nor the songs actually used but it's of that modern day rock/pop stuff that sounds so much like the previous song released in that genre, it's worrying. These songs that pop up at various intervals include montage sequences and the like, keeping the light hearted atmosphere and again, giving the kids something to relate to in the form of music. For me and probably anyone else over the age of 20, it was very disappointing.The fact the villain of the film is French is awkward enough. I say French but really, he's European and him and his non-American cronies are another disappointing aspect of the film. It's just too typical of an American summer film to do this: including a Eurotrash villain. The fact he actually spends most of the film in custody and has to issue his threats to press camera crews is another thing that detracts from the film. The fact he's in custody and out of harms way as far as violence and challenging the heroes is concerned; means less of a threat to the kids thanks to the 12A tag. With other odd things cropping up such as the fact each gang just happens to try and rescue the baddie at the exact same time with no prior arrangement of a truce as they all strive for the reward money, was a sloppy piece of film-making.Despite the good things S.W.A.T. has going for it, it never gets out of that, 'family' gear that it gets into and as a result, feels like a re-hash of that 1986 film Top Gun, only with guns and on the ground instead of jets and in the air. Still, at least you get to hear a couple of Jackson nods to his appearances in Pulp Fiction and Jackie Brown, respectively. That in itself, to some, is more than enough of a reason to give S.W.A.T. a go.",S.W.A.T.
42,GOWBTW,To those who forgotten the TV Series: Wake Up!!,7,15 February 2008,"I remember the TV show S.W.A.T. from experience. The word S.W.A.T. stands for Special Weapons And Tactics or Special Weapons Attack Team. These Police Officers are considered to be elites because they can handle hostile environment on civilian grounds that the regular police can't. They use high-powered guns, lighted and scoped, and wear heavy duty equipment for such situations. Most of the elites have military backgrounds: Army, Navy SEALS, Marines, etc. You name it, these people have an advantage. Unlike most policemen, these guys get better pay. That's what Sgt. Dan ""Hondo"" Harrelson (Samuel L. Jackson) was looking for: Police Officers with good records and wanting to get better pay for themselves. Those who haven't gotten any military training will soon get it. Hondo doesn't play around. These officers who become S.W.A.T. don't have to put up with the red tape, or demeaning actions from superiors who can't take the heat anymore. The cast of the movie are great, the storyline is fine and the action is non-stop. If anyone could remember the TV Series, they are not lost. Those who do, I suggest you watch the Show before you can enjoy the movie. When crime is heavy, don't called the regular police, call S.W.A.T.!! 3 OUT OF 5 STARS!",S.W.A.T.
43,dee.reid,8 1/2 out of 10 - That's good.,8,31 December 2003,"I have to admit that I didn't watch ""S.W.A.T."" thinking that it would at all be any good.  It actually is a pretty good movie.  Allow me to explain myself.You see, the summer of 2003 was filled with blockbuster after blockbuster after blockbuster.  Some were good (Seabiscuit, Hulk, Bad Boys II, this film), others weren't (The Matrix Reloaded, 2 Fast 2 Furious).  Even stranger, I own each of these movies on DVD or VHS because they're all just so appealing.  I'm getting off topic.  ""S.W.A.T."" is a summer action movie with respect for the intelligence of its audience simply because it takes place in reality.  The movie downplays a lot of the pointless action that's common in most summer blockbusters in favor of realism and characters.  I believe Samuel L. Jackson's character says something along the lines of ""you only roll in John Woo movies.""  How amazing, intelligent words coming from an intelligent actor in an intelligent movie.None of the characters in ""S.W.A.T."" are cardboard cut-outs but people who live real lives (they do have lives outside of work you know) and we get to see real development between them; just so you know, even though we see only maybe 2-3 minute glimpses of the characters outside of their jobs, that's a lot more than we see in most action movies today.  We see one character's family at a grocery store, we see another character on a date, one character attends their child's birthday party.  You see, it's a movie that actually makes you care about the characters.In speaking about action, the action scenes are quite intense and realistic. The story concerns Jackson heading up a team of new recruits that includes Colin Farrell, LL Cool J and Michelle Rodriguez to escort a European crime lord (Olivier Martinez) to an isolated prison in the desert.  Only problem is, said criminal has promised $100 million to anyone who can help him escape, which means hell for Jackson and crew, and getting out of Los Angeles in one piece.I just described the story's biggest action set piece (the escort of Martinez's character out of the city), which is incredibly staged and executed.  I have never heard of the director (Clark Johnson) but I must say he did a good job with this film.  If only more summer action movies were like ""S.W.A.T.""  Then maybe going to the movies in the summertime would be more rewarding.",S.W.A.T.
44,a_baron,S.W.A.T.,2,16 March 2019,"Samuel L. Jackson is an A List actor, so why would he appear in rubbish like this? Well, the film did have an estimated budget of $80,000,000, and as the saying goes, every man has his price.Seriously, if this were a James Bond film, boys' own or comic book action, it might just pass muster, but it is presented as a serious action thriller portraying S.W.A.T. teams in action, so falls at the first hurdle. The plot is ludicrous, yes, there are a lot of bad guys out there, but can even an international drug lord magic up a street full of foot soldiers armed with automatic weapons from a prison cell? In Mexico maybe, but not north of the border, not even in Los Angeles.",S.W.A.T.
45,juneebuggy,"Entertaining enough, and easily watchable but also pretty mindless",7,16 December 2015,"I remember seeing this when it first came out and really enjoying it. This time around though it viewed as just your average action thriller. Entertaining enough, and easily watchable but also pretty mindless. Good cast though; Sam Jackson is always cool, I enjoyed Colin Farrell as a demoted special weapons and tactics team member and Jeremy Renner as a hothead SWAT member gone bad.I did like the set up of an imprisoned drug lord offering up a 100 million dollar reward for anyone who can break him out, this of course sets up the obligatory guntoting mercenaries and big action sequences throughout downtown LA, its a cool idea.The training sequences were fun too as 'Hondo' assembles his elite team and he and Farrell provide some pretty entertaining banter as they drive around collecting and introducing the new rookies (LL Cool J & Michelle Rodriguez.) Olivier Martinez plays the bad guy here, he was okay, doesn't really do much. The police politics were cliché and on that note boring. Lots of shoot-em-up action but mindless as a whole. 11/24/15",S.W.A.T.

This movie plods along with the actors plodding along with it.  Colin Farrell is cardboard-like, Samuel Jackson tries with a character that has nothing and the rest of the crew seem to just be there.  It appears like someone had an idea to make this(thinking that the TV to movie formula would just automatically work) and then threw in a pitiful script at the last minute.  The final 15 minutes of action keeps you interested a little bit but other than this this is a sleeper.  I think I've said enough here, don't waste your time on this one.",S.W.A.T.
47,rbverhoef,For action fans,6,6 December 2004,"'S.W.A.T.' is a movie that does nothing more than deliver. It promises nice action scenes and gives us some. They look pretty good, so I guess in that way I can recommend the movie. The story is, of course, about S.W.A.T., a respected part of the LAPD. We follow a team with leader Hondo (Samuel L. Jackson), Jim Street (Colin Farrell), Sanchez (Michelle Rodriguez), Deke (rapper LL Cool J), Boxer (Brian Van Holt) and T.J. (Josh Charles). They have to deal with a criminal named Alex Montel (Olivier Martinez) who offers 100 million dollars to the people who will help him escape from jail.The movie opens with Jim Street and his partner Gamble (Jeremy Renner) saving people from bank robbers, but they do that after disobeying an order. Both are punished but Gamble thinks Street has betrayed him so Gamble leaves the fore while Street gets a job out of action. The movie continues six months later, leaving us with the feeling we will hear more from the Gamble-character. We feel correct. These facts, and may be that Street used to date Boxer's sister, are kind of important to know, although every event serves the action or the one-liners that are not that impressive.Yes, events are implausible, but not in a way they become annoying. For actions fans the movie does exactly what we expect and what we want, entertaining enough. If you are normally not an action fan, only when it is done very good, I should skip 'S.W.A.T.'!",S.W.A.T.
48,onepotato2,Swill,2,9 April 2010,"S.W.A.T. was lowest common denominator TV ...the end of an era for police shows. The desire to make a movie out of it reflects only the rockbottom nature of movie production. The movie is junk, but at the center of it was a decent idea: A drug kingpin on the way to prison utilizes some chance live TV coverage to ask, a la Becket ""Is there no one who would rid me of these pesky police?"" He offers a million bucks, and the floodgates are opened, with thug cadres attempting to execute various escape plans. This should have spared the movie the exhausted, dramatic dilemma of a central villain. No such luck. The story hasn't even begun moving by the 45 minute mark. Another decent conceit is the idea of landing a plane on a disused bridge to effect an escape. It might have made a better movie in the hands of even a slightly more thoughtful team. Instead the creators surround the conceits with dross; They can't wait to show you three hundred clichés they've picked up from other movies.This was not the future of action movies. It opened with no buzz, and is already looking creaky.",S.W.A.T.
49,rosscinema,Entertaining film inspired by television series,6,11 August 2004,"When I sit down to view one of these action flicks I'm usually preparing to watch something totally preposterous and inane but I thought this effort was surprisingly fun and brisk even though many scenes were fairly far fetched. Story is about a gung-ho S.W.A.T. officer named Jim Street (Colin Farrell) who along with his partner Brian Gamble (Jeremy Renner) take down some bank robbers but a hostage is shot by Gamble and the two of them must report to Captain Tom Fuller (Larry Poindexter) who tells them that they're either demoted or out of the police force. Street decides to accept his demotion while Gamble leaves the force very angry about his partner not going with him. Six months later Street meets the new leader of S.W.A.T. Sgt. Hondo Harrelson (Samuel L. Jackson) who is putting a new team together.*****SPOILER ALERT*****Hondo assembles a new team and Street is picked to be on it and so is Chris Sanchez (Michelle Rodriguez) who is a female and a single parent. Meanwhile, the police have Alex Montel (Olivier Martinez) in custody and he's an extremely dangerous drug and arms dealer and while on the news he yells out that he will pay millions of dollars to anyone that breaks him out. Hondo's team is picked to escort him to a federal facility but every gang and lowlife has the idea of trying to spring him. S.W.A.T. must try and find alternate methods of transporting him but a member of their team suddenly gets greedy!This film is directed by Clark Johnson who is mainly a director of action television shows and while he still has a lot to learn about character development his experience with staging action scenes comes in handy here. This film also has a nice pace and flow to it that Johnson must be commended for also and there is really no dull moments that take place. Jackson is well cast as the leader and he has that type of persona that can keep hell raisers in line, like Farrell. The films last 30 minutes are pretty unbelievable but this adds to the fun of the story like it did in ""The Italian Job"" and as far as escapist entertainment goes this film for the most part delivers the goods.",S.W.A.T.
50,Rob_Taylor,(S)tupid (W)ankers (A)ct (T)ough,5,20 April 2004,"Which about sums up the whole movie. Everyone tries to out-macho everyone else (even the token female character) and the whole thing is just plain ridiculous. It's more like a comedy than an action flick.The thing which aggravates me most though, is that were supposed to believe that a crack unit (such as SWAT is reputed to be) has such pitiful screening procedures for its candidates that it allows people with serious mental flaws into its ranks. The hero's nemesis, for instance, repeatedly ignores direct orders in favour of self-aggrandizement. Another character has such high moral and ethical standards that he sells out his buddies for cash. For God's sake! How dumb do the writers think people really are? These sorts of people would be weeded out of the program long before they ever got to hold a gun, much less point it at anyone.There are lots of stupid scenes in this film...too many to list here. It's not a patch on Charlie's Angels 2 for idiocy, but I hope this doesn't bode the start of a trend in Hollywood of putting in stupid scenes ""'cos we got the special FX to do it now!"" kind of mentality.In short, lots of rubbish packaged up into a movie. The best thing I can say about this film is that Colin Farrell (whom I hate with a passion) is one of the LEAST irritating things about the film.",S.W.A.T.
51,eric262003,A Film That Means Swat,5,30 January 2017,"The little facial expressions on the main cast can indicate where the movie ""S.W.A.T."" is going. From Samuel L. Jackson's macabre smile, Colin Farrell's airy moment of stillness to Michelle Rodriguez's fearless glower. Sure they make those expressions like this movie has a lot to offer, but this film truly lives up to its abbreviated title, it all means total swat.And sure the performers can pose in their stances to look fearless and intimidating, but the story based loosely on the 1970's television series doesn't do justice because the action is awkward and forgettable and the crew behind it gave me the impression that they're on sabbatical. An though this film isn't the worst movie I've ever seen, it still doesn't deserve any kind of praising from me.The diversification of the character's traits might shed a bit of light towards the movie ""S.W.A.T."" Samuel L. Jackson plays the role of Sgt. Dan ""Hondo"" Harrelson who collaborates a squad of dedicated and determined criminal fighting cops. Among his squad members are the solemn but intense Officer Jim Street (Colin Farrell) and the tough and fearless Chris Sanchez played by Michelle Rodriguez. It's great that we can get into get into the characters and to some extent LL Cool J's role as Deacon ""Deke"" Kaye who actually is really on for posing to blend in during group scenes.But then the movie goes falls into the obvious trap of unfulfilling cliché crap. Olivier Martinez is French gangster Alexander Montel who storms into the Los Angeles scene and no sooner does he slash he crime boss uncle by the throat while having dinner together and chimes, ""you take my money, I take your life."" So we're being fed to the villain right away without any need of introduction because we already know he has evil intentions. And yet the only offensive misdemeanour he was committed to was getting pulled over for a bad taillight and spends the majority of the movie clad in a prison jumpsuit.They also seem to playfully set up a romantic entanglement between Street and Sanchez. They're drinking together and being flirty and the next day he comes to her estate. Are we going to see another side of Rodriguez's acting that is never revealed because her true potential is always sidelined? Well keep dreaming, because once the bell rings, the squadron is off getting ready for the grand climax.The score from the first scene will turn optimistic fans into thinking that the opening scenes should garner some sign of excitement. The opening scene ventures into the middle of a brutally violent hostage situation. But the narrative offers no information about the takers or the hostages. All we get is a lamented soul crying about her life bawling in tears. Who is she? Better yet, who is anyone? It seems that director Clark Johnson seems to care more about the action scenes that have no meaning or reason behind it.And even though we are enlightened to know which cop drinks Dr. Pepper and which one consumes a lot of junk food, but fails to inform its audience as to why Montel is a deviant criminal or even give a damn if he should be locked or to roam free. We are also later awkwardly fooled that the principal friction in the story is not between Street and Montel, but Street and former partner Officer Brian Gamble (Jeremy Renner). It just feels so randomized in delivery.In the end of watching ""S.W.A.T."" all I can say is that the ideas seem to be in place, but fails to be fully assembled and then decide to just leave it like that as if it's not worth piecing together. It's really all very forgettable. The talent pool of accomplished performers would be better if they never added this movie to their credit on a resume.",S.W.A.T.
52,Luigi Di Pilla,Not enough power,6,30 May 2004,I expected more suspense and action. The first five minutes were promisingly but then you have to wait a good hour until something happens. The story is harmless and predictable and never gets enough power to become a hot movie. It is a classic plot; I mean here the special police and on the other side the terrorists. The actors did an average job seen that the story is thin. Here I think they could have develop s script with more substance. SWAT let me and my wife cold because it´s all déjà vu. SWAT shows how they handle their unities and their trainings. Sometimes I had the impression that it wants to follow the big success CON AIR but it stays far away from that one. SWAT is definitely not a must see because our rating is only 6/10.,S.W.A.T.
53,Terryfan,Mount Up,10,13 June 2015,"S.W.A.T. caught my interest from the first time I saw the trailer and TV Spots for the film back in 2003 I knew this was a film I would want to see in theaters and I'm glad I did, I saw it opening night in 2003. It still reminds one of my favorite movies I saw in theaters and that I have on DVD. The film features the cast of Colin Farrell, Samuel L.Jackson, Michelle Rodriguez, LL Cool J, Josh Charles, Jeremy Renner, Brian Van Holt, Olivier Martinez. And the film help made Jeremy Renner a star, Samuel L.Jackson once again shows what he could do with a character like his, Colin Farrell makes a good protagonist and it's good to see Michelle Rodriguez getting a chance to shine. What I like most about this film is the plot which is not something you see all the time in a action film and from the start it had my interest and I don't want to give it away because it's better if you watch the film for yourself.What also makes this film awesome to watch is the action and stunt scenes that happen in the film are extreme it like they wanted us to never know what happens next and this movie has a lot of those.It will have you on the edge of your seat as you watch the film with moments you won't never see coming that's what the movie reward you with is that it is hardly predictable I remember everyone's reaction in the film was amazed as the film is action packed and it deserves me credit than it deserves.Those in the theater were not disappointed as this film is no guessing what goes down next I'm serious if you just take the time to watch the movie with a open mind you'll be reward with super action scenes and tense moments it's a film you should look past the junk and see the treasureI give S.W.A.T. an 10 out of 10 still love it since I saw it in theaters",S.W.A.T.
54,KUAlum26,"Delivers what it promises,if not much else",7,14 December 2008,"I have almost no personal familiarity with the 1970s cult TV series for which this show was based,save a fairly neat multi-piece action set I got for Christmas as a small boy (which would be scattered,mangled or lost within a few months after I got it),so my working knowledge of this show is(and was)couched almost exclusively in this 2003 movie version itself.I mention this because,as I was to find out after seeing this movie(first in the theater five years ago,more recently as a purchase on DVD)when I looked up the film on IMDb,the characters and situations were supposed to be based on the series. Judging on the situations,material and pacing of this film,the creators weren't too concerned with making this particularly faithful to the series.This promises action and gun-play and delivers nicely. THere's not much you're going to know about LAPD elite vets Street(Colin FArrell),Sanchez(Michelle Rodriguez),KAy(LL Cool J), McCabe(Josh Charles),Boxer(Brian VAn Holt) and Hondo(Samuel L.Jackson),other than the fact that they're all very good at being cops and marksmen(And woman),and in the case of Street and Hondo,very good specifically at the title force. So,suffice it to say that when a very oily and amoral international criminal named Montell(OLivier MArtinez,perfectly insouciant)needs to be transported to the Fed pen,they get the call. It gets even more nasty when said criminal loudly announces to cameras that he'll reward anyone who can spring him free to the tune of nearly a quarter of a billion Dollars(Francs? Euros?).Director Clark Johnson has the look and sound down for someone who had previously very little experience(if any)directing non-t.v. projects,but the script seems to be somewhat shorted,probably to allow for both a tight brevity of running time and to keep the action and violence as straight and central to the developments. Farrell's done better as well as most of the cast,which is able to fill their physical roles well even if there's not much else to do. Bottom line is this movie is about as straight ahead as they come,in genre or out. Loud,fast and stylish,it won't disappoint so long as you keep your expectations reasonable.",S.W.A.T.

OK. As the poster says S.W.A.T. are the guys the cops call on when they are stuck, and in this film that is a lot. In fact if I was a normal cop I would hate this film, which suggests that they are unable to hit a gunman in plain sight and couldn't hand out a parking ticket without f*cking it up.Thank goodness for guys like Sam Jackson, Michelle Rodriguez and Colin Farrell's eyebrows that are as thick as rolled up carpets.For the better part of an hour they run through montage after exhausting montage backed by mediocre soft-cock rock. Even their day-off has it's own montage! Anyway the seemingly disparate crew comes together and *Sniff* even learns to rely on each other. They then hunt down a paint by numbers – and similarly pretty bad guy (he's French, so it's OK to hate him), who with one televised sentence manages to turn an entire city into cop-killers and bounty hunters, which is a cinematic justification for one of the more moronic half hour finales in history.I guess the moral of the story is: Why even have cops when you have S.W.A.T.?

57,inspectors71,For Just a Second . . .,5,18 March 2014,"I was irritated with 2003's SWAT, a modernized, big-budget version of the gasping-for-air-it-was-so-stupidly-unintentionally-funny ABC series of 40 years ago. Eight bazillion thugs, pugs, and mugs spill out into the streets to collect a reward put up by a cartel-type to get him out of the clutches of the LAPD. It's like the excremental Predator II, with the streets taken over by zombies in doo-rags.Then, Director Clark Johnson gets it under control. Control being defined as holding on to the steering wheel of a tightly-plotted SWAT van of clichés. At no time did I believe anything I was seeing, but damned if I didn't get pulled into this nonsense, much the way I loved the old series. I actually felt a little goose-bumpy at times, kind of chilled from the excitement.Is there anything wrong in enjoying a stupid shootemup like SWAT? I don't think so, if the movie's heart is in the right place, the Dollar Tree philosophy isn't too thick, and the narrative throws out some surprises I didn't see coming.I saw SWAT on TNT some weeks ago, and even with the occasional gout of blood or F-cracker being eliminated, it still seemed to come to the small screen intact. If I can forgive the network hacks hacking out the icky stuff, I get a double whammy of good value--mindless entertainment, all in the comfort of my own home. Shoot, I just had to wait ten years to see it.So, if you haven't seen this professionally produced cinematic equivalent to a 10 piece box of Chicken McNuggets, look for it the next time it's on the tube.It's worth the empty calories.",S.W.A.T.
58,sarastro7,Cool run-of-the-mill actioner,6,18 January 2005,"One of the reasons I didn't see this movie when it came out was that I was afraid it would be too violent or insensitive. I got that impression from the trailer, which had a scene where Michelle Rodriguez says something to the effect that she gets into lethal action because it ""tickles"" her. I'm not a fan of gratuitous and just-for-the-hell-of-it connections between sex and violence. That's very bad taste.However, now I saw the movie, and, funnily, that scene from the trailer isn't even *in* the movie. And it's not a very violent movie at all. Nothing to get shocked by; virtually perfectly family-friendly.The actors are pretty good, esp. Samuel L. Jackson and Michelle Rodriguez. Colin Farrel is not too bad, but neither does he bring much charisma to this role. The action is fairly good, the story is fairly interesting, and one is effectively entertained, although the level of excitement is never particularly high. This is well-produced run-of-the-mill Hollywood entertainment.Like so many other decent but unremarkable Hollywood actioners, this gets from me a rating of 6 out of 10.",S.W.A.T.
59,CitizenCaine,Action Based On The TV Series,6,3 November 2003,"S.W.A.T. stands for special weapons and tactics. This action film is based on the short-lived TV series of the 1975-76 TV season. It lasted for only that one season, but yielded the theme to it as a hit single. I believe the recording act was Rhythm Heritage or Rhythm Heritage Group. Hollywood should realize there's a good reason why the series lasted one season. The characters are all stock clichés in this movie. The hard ass leader that butts heads with his boss = Samuel L. Jackson; the young team member that has to redeem himself = Colin Farrell; the token black team member LL Cool J; the tough female recruit = Michelle Rodriguez; the hard ass boss that softens to take the credit, etc. The problem is that the movie turns into a formulaic blockbuster action film in the second half (more suited to a Bond film) after purporting to be an illustration of selection and training to the elite squad in the first half. I did not see any special tactics used throughout the movie either. Special weapons were limited to Colin Farrell's invention, which helps the squad gain entry. None of the characters is compelling or even interesting enough to sustain a feature length film, which is probably why the action is swift and explosive. We don't have a lot of time to get to know any of them. Just when we think we might, like at the birthday party, something else suddenly happens to shift the focus. Michelle Rodriguez is a great choice to play the female character, but she has very little to do in the movie in the way of action, other than to work on a punching bag in a training montage. Olivier Martinez is appropriately slimy as the villain. For some reason, up and coming directors these days think it's cool to have loud, obnoxious rock music soundtracks that drown the action and/or dialog like in this movie. An interesting note is that Robert Urich originally played Colin Farrell's role in the TV series. If you want to see mindless action, go see this movie. Otherwise, if you want to see the employment of special weapons and tactics, see The Italian Job. **1/2 of 4 stars.",S.W.A.T.
60,Bob-45,"Like the TV Series, It's Fast, Loud and Kinda Stupid",7,7 September 2004,"While watching the sample episodes of the 'SWAT: FIRST SEASON' DVD, I found myself thinking, 'This is achingly awful. This show must have been one of the inspirations for 'The Naked Gun' movies.' SWAT: THE MOVIE doesn't have the groaners of the series, but some of the plot machinations are just as bad. For example, the villain cuts his uncle's throat in full view of a dozen witnesses, including bodyguards. Then, he takes the uncle's car to airport without any guns or bodyguards. How dumb is that? I figured the female patrolman that stopped him for a routine traffic violation was dead meat. But, NO, he goes to jail without a fight(!!!) Now, think about it. This guy is wanted by INTERPOL and has just sliced his uncle, a well-connected mob boss. Why didn't this guy just waste the cop and steal her patrol car? The LAPD is unlikely to be quick enough to catch him before he gets to the airport.That being said, any movie that gives us Samuel Jackson and Colin Farrell can't be all bad. Samuel Jackson looks younger and stronger than he did 10 years ago. How many actors can you say that about? Michelle Rodriguez gets to play her badass Mexican chic to perfection. Too bad they didn't give her more action scenes. Nonetheless, there's enough gunplay and explosions for any action junkie. Not to mention a killer soundtrack. I'd say 'SWAT: THE MOVIE' is good enough for a weak '7'.",S.W.A.T.
61,carbuff,I Wanted a Mindless Action Film--A Bit Too Mindless and Not Really Right for the Times,3,1 July 2021,"""S. W. A. T."" is basically a live action cartoon. All of the characters are stiff and wooden and the plot is simple and predictable. It's a made-for-TV movie on steroids. Also, I don't really care about political correctness, but the highly militarized police force that this film depicts will no doubt rub some people the wrong way in our current times. That didn't bother me, because I couldn't take this film seriously from beginning to end. Carpenter's ""Assault on Precint 13"" made in 1976 is much along the same general (really general) lines and is so much better. How did this somewhat similar film get so much worse with such a huge budget and so many years to improve it? I just regret wasting my time on this time-waster, but if you're looking for a slick, high-budget, mindless, time-wasting, action film this will suit the bill perfectly. If I was a lot younger, I'd say grab some beers and some doobies (showing my age) and let it run--unfortunately that just doesn't seem to work for me anymore. It's a swing and a miss.",S.W.A.T.
62,gregsrants,First half promise does not overshadow second half letdown,5,21 December 2003,"Just say the word S.W.A.T. to anyone over the age of 35 and inevitably they will begin, either aloud or to themselves, to hum the theme song of the television show aired on ABC in the 1970's.  Spanning only 39 original episodes, S.W.A.T. the television show was revered by audiences but inevitably shut down due to the its excessive portrayal of street violence in California.But Hollywood has a tendency to make everything old, new again, and its latest re-hash is S.W.A.T. the movie starring Samuel L. Jackson and Colin Farrell.The movie begins interestingly enough with a new spin on the actual L.A. bank robbery in 1997 where heavily armed gunmen held off an increased police presence for 44 minutes.  In S.W.A.T., Jim Street (Farrell) and his partner Gamble (Jeremy Gamble) infiltrate the bank and take down the remaining criminals in a blaze of gunfire.  But all is not well in Copland.  Gamble disobeyed orders to not engage the enemy and in the firefight, injures a civilian who sues the force for millions.  Gamble is relieved of his duties and Street is reassigned to the supply cage where cleaning guns and shining boots become his new talents.Enter one Sgt. Hondo (Jackson) who at first encounter sees something in Street that the audience cannot and together, they begin to search for two new members to join the team. So, in reasoning that is too ridiculous to even contemplate, a five person team is assembled:  Sanchez (Michelle Rodriguez), T.J. (Josh Charles), Deke (LL Cool J), Boxer (Brain Van Holt) and Street all become members of the elite S.W.A.T. force.The first half of the movie consists of the team being built and trained through elaborate exercises that include the storming of a hotel and the taking of a passenger airline, all of which is very entertaining if even in a juvenile sort of way.The second half of the movie shifts to a story surrounding an international fugitive, Alex Montel (played by Unfaithful's Olivier Martinez), who when caught by authorities, goes publicly with an offer of $100 million dollars to anyone who helps him escape.  The newly formed S.W.A.T. team is assigned with the prisoner transfer and it is here that the story, the movie and the good warm feelings begin to turn.   First, there is the unbelievable street fight that occurs when wannabe millionaire gang members storm a police cavalcade on rural streets.  Gangs ambush the police with incredible firepower, bazookas, grenades and transport trucks.  Played out in ear-numbing decibels, the scene reminded me of Death Wish V when Charles Bronson took on an army of street thugs (that correlation is a bad thing!).But it gets worse.  One of the team members turns on his fellow S.W.A.T. patrons and aides in the escape of Mortel, in a turn that the audience figured out 15 minutes ago.  So, it's the remaining S.W.A.T. team vs. a team abetting the felon that also contains Street's old partner Gamble.  Wow. Never saw that before in a cop movie.  So how does it end? Well, any good critic will never reveal an ending so let me just illuminate what is already in the film's trailers.  There is gunfight, a plane that lands on a bridge, and I will let you guess which of the good or the bad becomes victorious.  S.W.A.T. is not a very good movie when taken as a whole.  There is terrible dialogue (`Looks like you need a band-aid') and an ending that is copied directly from Lethal Weapon.  And if anyone believes that Streets is part tracker, part ace marksman, part explosives expert and part weapons maker yet is assigned to shining boots, well then maybe this movie is for you. Too bad the first half showed so much promise and hooked me in.",S.W.A.T.
63,grahamsj3,Underrated,6,19 April 2004,"I haven't read the comments of others, so I'm not sure why it's rated so low. This is a pretty decent yarn with some good action and suspense in it. The story is almost believable. A drug dealer is detained by the Police and offers $100 million to anyone who can spring him. The offer is taken up by several people and the Los Angeles Police Department finds itself outgunned. Their only hope is the newly formed SWAT team, headed by Samuel L. Jackson. The whole SWAT thing is new and no one likes it. While, today, many people still don't like the idea of SWAT teams, they are now a part of the law enforcement landscape. It's too ""Military"" for most people. The film shows the build up and some of the training of the SWAT team, and their duel with the bad guys in the end. It kept my attention and I found it entertaining. And isn't that what the industry is all about? I gave it a 7.",S.W.A.T.

This movie does not deserve them as it is another pathetic ""update' of an old TV show(making LL Cool J's cameo in Charlie's Angels even more amusing). The music, especially the song over the credits, is pathetic and should have it's time run out. The direction is OK as is the script, but OK is not anything that a major production should be satisfied with. Bridget Powers would have been interesting with a larger part(perhaps Colin's part).

(2003) is a collection of random scenes, action cliches and some things which were popular in the early 2000s.The script feels very generic at first, they do invest some time in the characters though, but after around 75 minutes in it just roll down to random action mess that doesn't make any sense.They just pack as many cliches and overused setpieces as possible, prison transport attack (check), plane chase (check), mano-a-mano Lethal Weapon-style (check) and more.Not particularly entertaining or interesting, the CGI doesn't hold up and overall it feels very stale. Maybe it felt better at the time of the premiere, but in 2020 it is not worth the time.I did enjoy the breath of the early 2000s and it was nice to see that most of the cast of this film moved forward in Hollywood.",S.W.A.T.

67,redkiwi,"You're either typecast, or you're not",5,12 December 2003,"First up, he does it well.However, isn't Samuel L. Jackson getting a bit tired of playing the same character in every film?  As the hard hitting cop running the S.W.A.T squad, he's hardly actorally challenged in what's largely a bit of a yawnfest, save for a reasonable performance from Colin Farrell.having showed that he actually is a very good actor in challenging roles elsewhere, isn't it about time that Jackson started doing some more interesting roles?",S.W.A.T.

S.W.A.T. can't compare to other action films of the summer, like Terminator 3, but still stands as a mindless action flick, good for a matinee or if you just want an excuse to eat popcorn. It doesn't have the merits of a good movie by any means (the acting is bad, the plot is weak, along with characterization), but still is a good time for two hours.Jim Street (Colin Farrell) is in S.W.A.T. (Special Weapons and Tactics), but disobeys orders and is back to basics. However Sgt. `Hondo' Harrelson (Samuel L. Jackson) is looking for new recruits, and soon Jim is back in S.W.A.T. Soon, international terrorist Alex Montel (Oliver Martinez) is now in the U.S. andaww who cares? Did anyone buy a ticket for its deep, complex, and thoughtful plot? I didn't think so. There was a better plot on an episode of ""SWAT Cats"".Although its action scenes may not be anything original (a highway scene a la The Matrix Reloaded, a subway scene stolen from The Italian Job), they never bored me (something that scenes in The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen, the most recent other action movie I've seen, did). I wasn't always thrilled (except for that great opening scene), but I was never twiddling my thumbs or taking my eyes away from the screen.Back in the early summer of 2002, a film called Minority Report came out. Starring in it was the ever-popular Tom Cruise, but also a small star who I had never heard of. He was a good actor, and I hoped he wouldn't turn extremely famous. Sadly, Colin Farrell has become just that. He's just a tabloid thing, and it's really taken credibility from him. He seems to be good in every other movie he does: good in Minority Report and Phone Booth, bad in The Recruit and S.W.A.T..S.W.A.T., however, isn't believable at all. When someone is shot, isn't there blood? When there's fire, isn't there smoke? If they had gone for the R rating to make it seem more lifelike and add some sense to the otherwise worthless story, then it could have been a lot better. However, overall, do you like summer movies? Then you'll love S.W.A.T., which is just that.My rating: 6/10Rated PG-13 for violence, language and sexual references.",S.W.A.T.

It's an enjoyable, action thriller filled with all the guns, explosions and fighting you need.The plot is straight forward enough, no complications with it, the acting is pretty much as you expect and the camera work is also as you'd expect. So why is this an 8/10? It's just fun. I sit there and I'm throughly entertained by everything that's going on. It starts with a action filled 20 minutes or so. It fishes you in instantly and from then on there's no boring parts. Sure it contains a few cliches etc, but for me an action film is to entertain, have good intensity and suspense and overall just to enjoy it. And I did.Light hearted criticism here: the ""villain"" had no depth to him, I may have missed something, but I doubt it in 2 viewings now. He kind of just waltzes into the film and becomes this villain with no distinctive reason.Overall though it's just fun and entertaining.

What more could you want. Then I heard the reviews and a few friends saw it, bad news, bad film.So since I'm catching up on loads of movies I haven't seen in the cinema, I thought this should be one. This is where reviewing a DVD and a Movie should be different, and perhaps I should have set my reviews up differently, but I haven't so DVD reviews are for both DVD and Movie.What does that mean? That SWAT gets only four stars instead of five. What? I hear you say. The SWAT DVD is awesome. Before we hit that, let's talk about the movie.It's a big one, starring Samuel L. Jackson, LL Cool J, Colin Farrell and Michelle Rodriguez, and the all look like they are having a prize A blast. That's a great thing because it shows in a movie, these guys are working as a SWAT team, and on screen they flow like a real trained team. They other thing these guys bring is charisma, each of them has a huge screen presence, with Rodriguez setting off the balance perfectly.The opening scene sets the action straight from the end of the opening credits, recreating the famous north Hollywood shootout. The action is intense and you really do feel like you're part of the action.I expected the story to be way over the top, and it's not that wild. Of course there are a couple of bits that are pure cinema, but it's surprising to see how real and believable it all is. The entertainment level is really high, but it's mixed with some nice touches of reality, and a nicely satisfying ending.Now, the DVD. For the movie the audio mix is superb, Dolby Digital is very strong, and there's some excellent separation and you really do feel like you're in the thick of the action, something missing from so many other movies.There are two commentaries on the disc, one switches between the actors above (excluding Farrel, perhaps he feels he's moved on too far since this movie) and the director, although the actors aren't exactly informative, they are fun and it's great to hear some of the big screen characters chatting away together. The Director provides some interesting insights into the making.Then there's the writers commentary. Although there were many writers involved, the two who came up with the idea and worked on the initial drafts are there and the final screenplay writer. The best thing about that is the insight into the job of a screenplay writer and the involvement in the whole movie making process. Doesn't sound anywhere near as exciting or fulfilling.There are additional extras. The breakdown of the opening shooting scenes is very interesting and shows the sheer scale of work required on such an action packed scene. Then there's a few additional scenes, gag reel, weapons demonstration, etc. What is really exciting, and topped the DVD off for me, was the sound section.Taking five key action scenes, each is split into four audio tracks comprising something along the lines of guns, contact and explosions, background and full mix. The result is very engaging. Listen to each track separated and all at the same levels, skip back and change the audio track again and hear how it's built up to make the excitement.All in all the DVD and extras are excellent, something the Director gives out during his commentary is that both the commentaries were recorded before the movie was in the cinema, just after filming. Perfect. Contract the actors and key crew into a DVD commentary straight after the movie, throw everything at it and use production time to create some special DVD extras. I don't know if that happened here, but it sure seems like it, and it's an ideal way to create an excellent DVD product.As for the movie, it's great fun, and it's not as over the top as you would have thought. So I'm glad I watched it on DVD and not in the Cinema, a much better experience.",S.W.A.T.

The opening started off as boring and then it just continued on as just a long drawn out piece of garbage. I really like Samuel L.

But instead of giving him a birthday cake, he gives him a knife to the throat and steals the man's car. Montel is actually a foreign terrorist and crime lord wanted by a dozen countries.

Hondo and his crack force of S.W.A.T. members including the young officer Jim Street (Colin Farrell) who is one of the top officers in the force. The film is action packed and has some pretty cool special effects which aren't overdone. The violence is extreme at some scenes but little blood is present making the scenes suitable for young adults. Samuel L. Jackson does an average job as the sargeant and LL Cool J does a fantastic job as officer David Kay.

84,tccandler,Skip this film and rent 'Die Hard' for the millionth time instead!!!,3,10 January 2004,"I am not exaggerating when I say that nothing significant happens until the 63rd minute of the film.  I checked my watch!  The first 62 minutes are filled with a random succession of training montages like those found in your run-of-the-mill 1980's Rocky sequel.  First we get a little shooting range action... Then we get a little heavy-bag work from Collin Farrell... Then we get a few simulated hostage situations... All of which are set to peppy rock and roll tunes.  There is virtually zero character development in those first 62 minutes, which prevents us from caring too much about these characters whose names we barely know.  Without too much effort in the editing room, the entire first hour could have been condensed into ten minutes.Finally, at about the time you only have a few unpopped kernels left at the bottom of your butter soaked bag, the actual plot gets under way.  Our SWAT team is assembled, an ethnically diverse mélange and the token hot chick, all included according to the 'politically-correct' guidelines.  Sam Jackson is the leader of the bunch.  Collin Farrell is the 'hero'.  LL Cool J is the free-wheelin', loud-talkin' one.  Michelle Rodriguez is the tough girl who 'don't take no s*** from no man'.  And there are a few others who putz around and fill up space so the screen doesn't look so empty.Olivier Martinez is the bad-ass French criminal mastermind. (There are more oxymorons in that phrase than I can count).  He is a detained international arms dealer who boldly offers $100 million to anyone who can get him out of jail.  Needless to say, this causes some consternation for our SWAT members.The last part of the film moves swiftly but fails to generate any tangible thrills.  We get a few botched attempts to break out the criminal with shamefully messy action sequences.  The director fails to generate any continuity or flow to the action and it results in a jumbled procession of explosions and improbable shoot-outs.  Quite frankly, this film is a sloppy production.A film like this doesn't need to be meaningful or important in any way, it just needs to entertain and thrill the audience for two hours without resorting to tired clichés, routine plot lines and standard action scenes. This film is replete with those, and it makes for a supremely forgettable action clone that you won't be able to differentiate from the dozen or so others that are released each year.  Skip this film and rent 'Die Hard' for the millionth time instead!!!",S.W.A.T.
85,rparham,"Been here, done that",5,11 October 2003,"The genre of television series transformed into movies has added a new body to it's impressive list of victims, in the form of SWAT.  Based on a '70s television series that I have not seen, therefore cannot compare anything to, SWAT is a rather dull, plodding and cliche affair that is not really worth the time it takes out of your day. It wants to be a no-nonsense, hip action film, but it just ends up recycling countless other (better) films, and, in the process, putting the audience to sleep.The plot of SWAT mostly focuses on tarnished SWAT team member Jim Street (Colin Ferrell), who has been placed in the unenvious position of cleaning weapons after he and his partner are reprimanded for a SWAT mission gone slightly bad in which they ""pushed the envelope.""  However, Jim's chance for retribution is just around the corner as the irreverent Sgt. Dan 'Hondo' Harrelson has been selected to put together a ""hot, young"" team of SWAT members with the intention of getting tough on crime around L.A.  Hondo takes a shining to Street and picks him up with several other semi-reject L.A. police officers who have the skills but have been held down by their outside-the-rulebook natures (or, in the case of a female officer, their sex).  After his team proves itself, it is their job to transport a international drug kingpin (Alex Montel) to prison while a hidden operative does his best to free the drug lord.If any of the previous paragraph sounds the least bit familiar, it's because SWAT doesn't have an original idea in it's whole running time.  Everything, and I mean pretty much everything, has been seen before.  The second-raters who have to prove themselves, check.  The unorthodox leader who likes getting in his superior's way, check.  The fallen hero who has to put things right, check. The aggressive, unsupportive Captain, check.  Nothing in SWAT is the slightest bit original.  Now, this might be forgivable had the film been entertaining.  Unfortunately, for the most part, it's not.  SWAT drags for the first hour or so, as we seen Hondo put his team together and watch them train, and see their first bit of ""action.""  SWAT is slow, slow, slow. And because there is nothing we haven't already seen before unfolding on screen, if you are the slightest bit tired, you are going to be in trouble watching this film.The only real saving grace is that the last 45-minutes or so, which is pretty much comprised of one large action sequence, manages to be fairly diverting and at times exciting.  It's nothing so amazing that it saves the film and would allow me to recommend it, but it at least makes you feel less cheated out of your ticket price (or rental price, or, hell, the two hours of your life).The acting is generally good.  Colin Ferrell and Sam Jackson, two rather reliable performers, do their best with this material, and they make the endurance of it tolerable.  The other support actors (L.L. Cool J, Michele Rodriguez, Josh Charles) are all capable, but their characters are somewhat limited in their screen time, so don't make too huge of an impression.  Alex Montel is okay as the villain, but his character pretty much fails to register as anything terribly frightening or intimidating.In the end, SWAT would seem to be an example of style over substance, as the flashy camera work and bankable actors flail about on screen with nothing much to do, and as such, proves to be a late summer disaster.  This is no Fugitive.",S.W.A.T.

'S.W.A.T.' fails to deliver on all levels so during the movie you keep asking yourself why? Why is this movie made and for what audience? I mean 12-15 will have a good time, but any one who is a bit serious will easily see that there is no script worth reading, no acting and directing worth looking. Script is stupid (why in the world would French criminal Alex Montel, wanted all over the world, enter in the U.S.A. and all alone??...), impossible (plane landing on bridge...) and predictable (we all knew that Josh Charles ((T.J. McCabe)) would be a traitor cause he always plays same type of characters...). But I'll put aside stupid and unrealistic plot that gives all the actors nothing to act and mention the fact that this movie is so slow. There is no action adrenaline or any action scene worth remembering so this really became just another missed action flick (Silly) with few known actors, cliché scenes (Washy) and idiotic plot (Trashy) = S.W.A.T.

91,ilovedolby,"Unlike other action flicks, `S.W.A.T.' is actually good.",8,11 August 2003,"It's official-Colin Farrell has finally become a household name. And why not when you consider what a great actor he is? After his stellar performances in `Minority Report,' and `Phone Booth,' the man deserves the right of being called a star. The latest film to be released with Farrell is `S.W.A.T.,' which is based on the 70s TV show. Unlike other action flicks, `S.W.A.T.' is actually good. It certainly isn't anything too deep or dark like the cop thriller `Narc,' however, you can bet that `S.W.A.T.' will entertain and also leave you on the edge of your seat. It's got a slick cast that stars Samuel L. Jackson, LL Cool J, Michelle Rodriguez, and Olivier Martinez. What's more, its direction by Clark Johnson is very well done. `S.W.A.T.' is truly the action film of the summer that we've been waiting for.	`S.W.A.T.' tells the story of Jim Street (Farrell), an L.A. cop who has been recently taken off the S.W.A.T. team because he and his partner disobeyed a direct order that resulted in the shooting of a hostage. In order for Street to save his future position on the team, he admits to his captain that his partner, Brian Gamble (Jeremy Renner), was out of line to disobey the order. Gamble has proven throughout his career on the S.W.A.T. team that he is a hot head and his captain would like nothing more than to see him off the force. Things turn around for Street, though, when an old school S.W.A.T. member named Sgt. Dan 'Hondo' Harrelson (Jackson) comes on board to put together an elite division of the S.W.A.T. team with some of the departments finest cops. After their rigorous training, the new team is ordered to handle a case in which an international drug dealer named Alex Montel (Martinez) has to be delivered to federal prison. After Montel is captured, he blasts his mouth off to a news crew that he will give $100,000,000 to anyone who can get him out of prison. So naturally, the whole city of Los Angeles is trying to elude police and public officials. It even leads to police helicopters being shot down and punks in the street shooting L.A.'s finest. But the only thing that the cops weren't expecting is that one of their own would behind a plot to get Montel out of custody. It all leads to a stunning climax that only the special weapons and tactics team could handle. 	It's expected that action films will have absurd scenes that could not or rarely happen in reality. Hence the reason why we have action flicks. Unlike the absolute stupidity of this summer's early action film, `Bad Boys II,' which felt like `Black Hawk Down' meets Miami, `S.W.A.T.'s' action is believable. It doesn't go over the top with things exploding everywhere, although it couldn't be an action film without a few good ones.	Regardless of things exploding, this movie proves to have some good suspense shots. The opening scene takes place in a bank where robbers have held hostage several people as they pepper the police with bullets from machine guns. The scene is not only terrifying to watch, but it's also a dizzying. Director Johnson used non-steady camera shots to give the audience the nauseating feeling of being in such a horrible situation.	`S.W.A.T.' is a simple story, one that has done before, but you find yourself enjoying it's cocky nature and good action sequences. `S.W.A.T.' is not only genuinely intense, but it is this summer's best action film. ***",S.W.A.T.

I know there are people out there that won't like this movie for whatever reason, but it's almost like COPS meets SURVIVOR (or any other reality based TV show).Jackson and Farrell combine on screen for, what I think, is one of Jackson's best outings.  His character was a lot more believable than SHAFT and you always knew who was in control when he was around.  Farrell has really been hitting the big screen, lately, and he doesn't let us down, here, either. Both characters are believable, but the plot is not...I'll leave that for you to make your own mind up.If you're a fan of the old series, then watch the movie.

93,lotus_chief,I got what I expected....,6,9 August 2003,"**SPOILERS INCLUDED**I had my doubts about this film, but overall I enjoyed it. I'm not a big fan of Colin Farrell, quite frankly I'm sick and tired of seeing him everywhere. But, he was good in this role...its a typical role for him. I respect Samuel L. Jackson for keeping busy, but I didn't quite like his role in S.W.A.T. Nevertheless, he was efficient as always. The superior officer, Jackson's good friend (Reg E. Cathey) was absolutely HORRIBLE in this film! He's usually better than this, his acting was atrocious...he just seemed to be trying way too hard. I don't particularly like Michelle Rodriguez, but she was convincing in her role.S.W.A.T. is a decent action film. Not great, but not terrible. I wish they didn't have the Street character so ahead of the other team members...I know he's been through all of it before but it should have been more balanced. The dialogue was a little too cartoonish for me, clichéd to the max with cheezy one-liners...but the point got across, which I guess is all you can ask for in a summer action flick. The plot twists (i.e. the turn of Gamble) was predictable, at least for me anyway. Best scene in the film, the 'rat race-like' hunt for the fugutive by any and every self-proclaimed bad man in Hollywood/LA LOL. Seeing two-bit gangbangers with rocket launchers was funny.

I thought that the character introductions were purposeful, the training sequences were a highlight and most the story made sense. Unfortunately, the climax was anti-climactic, and the characters lacked closure. The ending sequence felt like an episode of a 42-minute TV show rather than a feature film.

96,Ronin47,"Dynamite first half, extremely weak second half (**1/2)",6,19 October 2003,"""S.W.A.T."" suffers from what I like to call ""Training Day syndrome"". ""Training Day"" had a first half that was well-written, intriguing and suspenseful, only to collapse into a formulaic, business-as-usual action movie in the second half. It was disappointing, and ""S.W.A.T."" is disappointing in the same way. It starts very well; Colin Farrell (who seems to be becoming the new ""young"" Mel Gibson, and I mean that as a compliment) plays a S.W.A.T. officer named Jim Street who was kicked out because his partner (Jeremy Renner, from ""Dahmer"") is aggressive and impulsive and handled a hostage situation poorly. Street is out for a few months, but when the well-respected Sgt. Hondo (Samuel L. Jackson) comes looking to put together a new S.W.A.T. unit, he requests Street to be on the team. Also on the team are Deke (LL Cool J), and Sanchez (Michelle Rodriguez). Cool J and Rodriguez aren't playing characters they haven't played before, but I don't mind. Their job in this movie is to look cool and be cool, and they do it exceptionally well. This first half, as the team members train and get to know each other, is excellent. Funny, fast-paced, interesting, and there are some good songs (by artists like Jimi Hendrix and Jane's Addiction). It seemed like it was going to be a really good nuts-and-bolts action movie. Then, they get to the story... The main story involves a big-time drug dealer (Olivier Martinez from ""Unfaithful"") and his various attempts to get out of jail. Without spoiling too much, this story is weak. And two particular story developments in the last half are preposterous and unrealistic, which undermines the relative realism of the first half. Naturally, it all builds up to a very routine, predictable action climax that left me saying ""who cares?"". The first half though, it's solid. The main characters are interesting, the writing is good and so is the direction. Maybe they'll carry that through the whole movie when the sequel comes around.",S.W.A.T.

Someone wrote the script on his lunch-break and of course it shows it, scene for scene.   The talented Colin Farrell moves through it as if distracted while the makers of this hodge-podge at times appear to have forgotten that they were making a film and seem to be lost inside an ampted-up rock concert.  The soundtrack of this ""rock-concert"" is not equalized with the rest of the movie track so it lumbers periodically into the audience's ears intrusive, distracting and unwanted, like a Tyrannosaurus Rex at a nasty picnic.	S.W.A.T. has its moments, of course, just a few.   Typical of today's mostly made-for-teenies Hollywood fare, its production values are its only true virtue.

99,extravaluejotter,So WhAT?,1,16 October 2006,"Colin Farrell and Samuel L Jackson are good actors but sometimes they sign on for really bad films. What attracted them to the so-called screenplay of ""SWAT""? Was a $100 bill taped to each page of the script?Well, whatever. They were the big stars in the film and they couldn't summon up enough screen presence between them to out-act their prop guns. These two stars have produced outstanding performances in other films but in ""SWAT"" they're more stiff and dull than the weapons they carry. Maybe there weren't enough $100 bills taped to the pages of the script? The rest of the cast should hang their heads in shame as well. If you like watching a full set of stereotypical cardboard characters cranking out cliché'd lines, then you'll love this movie.Despite a good TV CV, Director Clark Johnson is lost on the big screen. A lot of the action is rigidly framed, a la TV, which highlights the fact that Jackson and Farrell are faxing their performances in from their trailers. When Johnson tries to create some energy with a jerky, restless camera style, all this does is take the focus away from the tiny amount of drama that the listless cast are trying to inject into the limp script. Johnson is also let down by cheap CGI, which renders a plane landing on a road bridge (supposed to be one of the big stunts of the movie) as realistically as an Airfix Lear jet on a Lego brick set.

Join-the-dots simplistic black and white action movie.  First of all, ok, the training part, this could have been a good idea.  It could have built up some affection for the people in the SWAT team.  Of course due to a clumsy script and bad direction it was just a dull, rather boring, delay before we got to the main story.Once the main story actually arrived, it was hardly worth waiting for.  A cigarette packets worth of plot rammed home with every 80's action movie cliché.  To show you how bad this was, I spent the whole time desperately hoping the 'bad guys' would win.How about having grey characters, imagine what a superior film it would have been if, Farrell and Hondo, decided to take the money and run.  People are not just good or bad, everyone has faults and that should always be reflected by film, if they want them to be plausible.Was there actually anyone who didn't predict the end of the film, after the first 20 minutes.  Why make Brian Gamble, so extreme.  It would have been much more believable, if he was still friends with Jim Street.  Why have the inevitable , stupid fist fight between the 'good guy' and the 'bad guy'.Some of the other reviews have mentioned this film was realistic.  What planet do you live on.  Car's cannot overtake Jet planes.   A SWAT team does not work 24 hours a day and especially one where one of the group became a criminal and killed himself.  Speaking of which, it was nice to see at the end, how much they actually cared about this, joking and laughing.  I assume there would have been an investigation into why Jim Street, beat up and killed a suspect in this case (someone whom he has a history with), he would have been suspended pending an inquiry.  Of course this isn't the real world, this is Hollywood, where police officers are encouraged to shoot who they feel is guilty.Overall very sad, that a film like this is still getting made, 1/10.Mr Jackson what are you doing, XXX (worst film ever made), Shaft and now this crap.",S.W.A.T.

The film is refreshing take back to the grittier and more serious action films of before. Now this is far from being a great movie but it's certainly entertaining and is never dull at all.

105,clydestuff,From forgettable TV Series to forgettable film.,4,13 January 2004,"I can't say that I remember too much about the 70's TV series that this film was based on.  I have some recollection that it might be possible that I watched an episode or two.  In a few years, I'm sure I'll have the same recollection of this film version of S.W.A.T. and it won't have anything to do with old age.  For all it's glorified action sequences and daring do, high priced stars, S.W.A.T. in the end plays out as nothing more than a more lengthy episode of a t.v. drama.  Lack of character development, pretty much brainless, easily forgettable.Samuel L. Jackson has the lead as Sgt. Dan ""Hondo"" Harrison who is selected to train a rag tag bunch of misfits into a cohesive S.W.A.T. unit.  Colin Farrel plays Jim Street, the head misfit, who had been a member of S.W.A.T. previously but was demoted to a supply clerk for reasons given early in the film.  Also on hand are Michelle Rodriquez and L.L. Cool J. as members of the team, with Brian Gamble and Olivier Martinez as the chief villains. Larry Poindexter plays their boss Captain Fuller as a silly twerp, but most of these kinds of bosses are usually written that way. All of these are plug in roles that could have been played easily by just about any actor worth his salt.  Jackson is basically reprising the same character from the films Basic, XXX, and Shaft.  I suppose he keeps the characterization around to do films like this when he is in need of a paycheck.  Colin Farrel plays Street as a real moody sullen type of guy.  We know he's been demoted, we see him break up with his girl but are never given any reason as to why although the writer feels it necessary to bring it up from time to time, even going so far as to make Street's ex-girlfriend's brother one of the SWAT members. Other than that we know little about what makes him tick but then again we probably aren't supposed to.  Rodriquez is a single woman trying to raise a daughter.  We feel for her but just as everyone else in this film we never are given the chance to know her.We do get the perfunctory training sequences where our motley crew becomes an ace SWAT team by going from being lousy to the best.  These scenes take up a good portion of the film unnecessarily so as we've seen it done in every film of this type from The Dirty Dozen to Private Benjamin.  The time would have been better spent finding out what makes these cops tick.The action sequences are as usual, far-fetched for the most part.  That never bothers me as it is expected in this kind of film.  However, in the last part of the film we are given one of those plot twists that is a bit too far over the top, and no real reason given for it except to have us believe that greed can overcome even the best of us.  I wouldn't have any problem with that either except we are given no hint or clue as to that it might happen so it could have just as well been any character in this film. It's also an unnecessary distraction in an action film where there shouldn't be one.All in all, if you have a few bucks to spare, you'll make it through this one without being too bored.  If you were a fan of the TV show you might even find it great entertainment.  Unfortunately, like the TV show most people had forgotten about until this film version came along, SWAT the movie, will eventually suffer the same fate.My Grade C-",S.W.A.T.

This isn't the smartest, most groundbreaking movie out there, but it does its job  to entertain!Every main actor in the picture provided a bit of coolness to the movie. Samuel L. Jackson, probably the coolest actor of all time, does his thing as a veteran S.W.A.T. officer.  Relatively new superstar Colin Farrell serves as a strong lead character that the movie revolves around.  L.L. Cool J is just cool no matter what he does (hold on, I take that back.

Nevertheless, he did a good job in this movie as did Michelle Rodriguez, who plays a single mom and the only woman on the S.W.A.T. force.Okay, so it's not an in-depth story that will change your life, but it will keep you entertained for the two hours you're watching this movie.  There are some turns and surprises that keep the movie interesting, and the special effects are just fun to watch.

It's not one in which you have to ""switch off"" your brain to enjoy, where the cops chase the robbers and have a stakeout in some abandoned industrial plant.  No, this one's a little more realistic, I think.The movie starts out with a classic scenario--a bank holdup.  Kind of cliche, yes, but the SWAT team's tactics are more than just the usual sheriff-and-robber-duel.  With the use of special tools and weaponry, a movie focused on a SWAT team can't really go too far in the wrong direction.There is a major lack in character development.  We see each main character for about a day on the job before they join the SWAT team, but other than that we really know nothing about them.  Most of them are cliche as well--the quiet guy who is a tactical genius, but who really doesn't want to join back up; the tough black man who respects his fellow blacks, but doesn't have a problem putting them away when they're in the middle of a crime; the hero's rival teammate, who wisecracks at him much of the time; the tough woman who is just as good as the men; and finally, the evil international criminal with plenty of contacts and money who teams up with the main character's former partner.  Despite all these noted flaws, there really is nothing wrong in which the way the characters interact with each other.  Besides, you can't expect much character background from a movie--that's what books are for.As far as storyline and plot, it's not all that original, but it's unique in its own ways.  The international criminal offers ANYBODY one hundred million dollars as a reward for breaking him out--and this offer is made on live television.  Now, from here on, the movie could have been rather exciting. Not only could we have seen the SWAT teams and police fighting off the mobsters trying to get the money, we could have seen the different gangs fighting each other for the money as well.  And that chaos could have been very tense and exciting.  However, the movie strays from that idea and we don't see any real gang war.  Instead, the second villain shows up and adds another hindrance to our heroes.The movie is, yes, rather predictable, but still entertaining and interesting.  While I wouldn't tell somebody they MUST see it, I would certainly recommend it, even if you're not a huge fan of the genre.",S.W.A.T.

Even if it is called a remake, the only thing it has in common is the name and the theme. Action movies have been full of computer effects and little soul lately. S.W.A.T. brings action back to it's roots. There is good guys, bad guys, shootouts, chases, one-liners, and fistfights. Ah, that takes me back. But also it teaches a lot about police operations and even a couple messages about greed. Samuel L. Jackson is a badass as usual. Not Pulp Fiction badass, but badass nonetheless. Colin Farrell is good as the young hothead and Michelle Rodriguez is tough and, frankly, hot. LL Cool J is funny but his character isn't much different than all his other movies except In Too Deep. S.W.A.T is a good time at the movies and one of my favorites this year. 7/10",S.W.A.T.

115,mwendel,Can someone please tell one complete story? (Possible Spoilers),6,24 August 2003,"There's nothing wrong, in my opinion, in a technical sense with this film. Its watchable.  The action sequences are good.  You can tell the good guys from the bad guys and in general I enjoyed the movie.What I really felt was frustrating was all the incomplete story lines that were never really developed and fleshed out.  What got Samuel Jackson's character moved out of SWAT in the first place?  What did he and the chief have against each other?  What really made Josh Charles' character turn against the SWAT team? It wasn't completely out of the blue, but the character as we saw him didn't really leave us any real concrete reason for what he did, he didn't appear (other than greed) to have any real motivation.  What was with the 3-second Ashley Scott cameo as Colin Farrell's girlfriend - I mean she said it wasn't working, but why?  What was it that made that relationship so impossible - his job or her brother being on the force or something else?  Was there a relationship developing between Michelle Rodriguez's and Colin Farrell's character?  It was not clear as to whether they were being friends or if it was going further than that, especially when Farrell's character is sitting there in the truck driving to the climax of the movie, with Scott's character's brother encouraging him to give her character a call and he appears to seriously consider it.Just too many holes, lost sub-plots and loose threads for me.  This movie could have been much better had the characters been given more depth and motivation for their actions.  An enjoyable movie with a great cast, yes, but by no means anything beyond the normal stale cops and robbers action movie.  For the number of talented actors within this film, I expected a lot more and it just didn't deliver.",S.W.A.T.

Except for the cliche'd, idiot police captain, the rest of the characters are interesting and believable.  the scenes of SWAT training and competition are way aboveaverage, and fairly unique.  I was really enjoying this flick.Until about halfway in, when the bad guy escapes.From then until the end, this turns into just another mindless, intellect-insulting action flick.  lots of stuff blows up, lots of bullets fly, and the plot makes no sense whatsoever.  I saw this on cable, and at about the one hour point, I literally switched to CNN.

Starting off with a below average action scene, Jim Street (Colin Farrell) refuses to rat out his rebellious partner, somehow ending in a falling out between the two. Street is kicked off, but determined to prove his worth, so he trains up and around six months later (yep, you guessed it) he's back on. Forming up with Samuel L. Jackson (why, oh why, did he star in this?) they go around recruiting to find a S.W.A.T team in an overlong, dull process, trying to prove that action-movies aren't just guns and car chases. Some of those at least manage to entertain. Not this, however. So, they pick up some people (including babe Michelle Rodriguez) and are off to fight some bad guys, including Olivier Martinez, who offers a handsome sum to be busted out of jail. Some of the action scenes at least show energy, but that's about it; dull, overlong and just plain idiotic, S.W.A.T. misses all the targets by a long shot. * out of ***** (1 out of 5)",S.W.A.T.

The only watchable character in this movie was the French villain, or ""Frog"" as Jackson kept calling him. Wonder how many French guys get to call a dude of African descent by a derogatory name, but that is political correctness for you. Anyone else noticed how many French villains there are in Hollywood movies in the year the French dared criticise the American conquest of Iraq? Makes a change from the English, I suppose.

121,arnieiam,I just found out some interesting things,8,23 January 2012,"On the surface this appears like a brainless actioner, which it is even after I re-watching it almost 10 years later. It has very limited plot and character development. However unlike most brainless actioners, you can't help but fell how unusually close this film is to a police procedural.The director is Clark Johnson, who directed many episodes of The Wire, which is my favourite television series of all time. The reason why that show was good because of its unusually accurate portrayal of Baltimore.Now this film could've gone in the direction, with the whole analysis of the LAPD and LA by exploring gang culture, police corruption and institutional racism which is subtly does in many scenes. However this is a movie based on an old 70s TV show and is centred on the the SWAT team, and it was meant to be an actioner therefore it needed to stray from that path as well.So if you actually view this as an action film working with the constraints of a police procedural, its not that bad.

I am all for a little silliness, if the movie's pace and humour can handle it. This one cannot. Everyone is typecast, the plot is a vehicle for Colin Farrell, Samuel Jackson and some formula action scenes.
My recommendation? If you want to see a good movie about terrorists, watch ""Die Hard"" for the 27th time, it is still a better use of time.One last gripe about the use of the word ""frog"" in such lines as ""put the frog in the bus"" - Imagine if the french made a film about a black us terrorist and called him a nigger?",S.W.A.T.

Two: I knew when some things were going to happen so they should have made it difficult to recognize a certain thing in a scene. Three: The movie should have been more real than it was. Like blood should have been present much more and the helicopter looked fake although I know it is difficult to do that sort of thing so I'll give them that.Overall I thought this movie was really cool and they made a good effort to make this movie as accurate as they could to real SWAT.

125,markymark70,average... unrealistic...,6,21 February 2007,"SWAT is an action movie with some reasonable action scenes and lot of posing and running around with huge machine guns. It is not a bad movie per se, but neither is it a good movie either. Farrell does well enough with his role as does Jackson but they both look like they are ""acting"" the part. I know that is what they are really doing but as an actor they have failed to instill the belief in the audience that they are in fact members of an elite SWAT team. It's not all their fault though as the writers and director don not give them much of a chance to really bring that belief across. The scenes with Farrell that are not action scenes are quite good - and just as you are being lulled into something more meaningful than a street gunfight - the camera whips away to the next action set-piece. As for the street gunfights ? Jees - I've seen more realistic stuff on the cartoon network. For a SWAT team - these guys don't have any qualms about jumping from a truck and spraying the entire street with sub-machine gun bullets hitting anything in their range. Neither do the bad guys have any problems with standing in the middle of the road - with no cover - alone - blasting at a plethora of cops / SWAT members et al. Certain death just does not come fast enough in this respect.Take the first scene - an opener to the film to follow. Two bad guys stand in the middle of the street spraying all and sundry with bullets. No cover, they don't even attempt to hide or protect themselves from police return fire. Yet they still manage to peg a few policemen and continue this ridiculous fight for a few minutes before their inevitable deaths arrive. And as for the SWAT team and their police colleagues - they are unable to kill any of these guys without first discharging several thousand bullets. A kid with a pellet gun would stop one of these guys quicker. Later in the film a helicopter is shot down by a shooter from roughly a mile away - now the cops should recruit that guy and save themselves a hell of a budget in bullets and body bags.Nonetheless, I enjoyed the film to an extent that it won't last too long in the memory but it was okay to while away a couple of hours being mildly entertained by it all. However, for it's $80M budget - I suspect the makers wanted a bit more impact. The end scene sets up a possibility of a sequel too - but I reckon that will never happen. If it does (and there is scope there to make this more interesting) then a new director and writer is a must. 6/10.",S.W.A.T.
126,crazyrabbits,Middle of the road...,8,30 August 2005,"The film ""S.W.A.T."" is pretty much your run-of-the-mill summer action flick. While it does have a few good moments, it's still easy to predict the outcome of the movie. The film is basically about a cop named Jim Street (played by Colin Farrell) is kicked off the Los Angeles SWAT police unit for endangering the lives of civilians, but he gets a chance to make up for his mistake when Lieutenant Hondo (played greatly as always by Samuel L. Jackson) recruits him to head up a new SWAT team. The acting is strong (featuring good performances from Muchelle Rodriguez, LL Cool J, and Olivier Martinez), the film moves at a quick pace, and the action sequences never leave you bored. The only problem I have with this movie is that there's barely any plot to speak of. The first hour and 15 minutes are all setup, but when the movie moves into the long chase sequence with the team going after Montel, the film just feels kind of empty. When you look over the film, and see that the last 45 minutes of the film just include a chase through a subway, a chase through a storm drain system, and the final action sequence on the bridge, it's just lacking somehow. You can also predict the twists that occur in the movie. I knew, even before the halfway point in the movie, that at least one person would turn on the others, and that Gamble would be involved in the kidnapping. I was right.Bottom Line: Despite it's flaws, there is still a fun time to be had in this movie. Go pick it up if you have a chance.",S.W.A.T.

Every time I nodded off―after about forty-five minutes of this stuff my brain cells were starving for genuine entertainment―the music score roared me back.

If you ask why I went in the first place, I was hoping (what a wonderful word ""hoping"") that S.W.A.T. might give a penetrating and accurate look at what actually goes on in a S.W.A.T. team and how individual members cope with it on a day-to-day basis.

He the tries to make the same bargain with the SWAT officers who are transporting him, so he pits the team against themselves. Notable Acting: Samuel L. Jackson, Colin Farrell and LL Cool J all did a great job at acting their parts, the others were good, but didn't steal my attention as much as the others did. Noticeable Camera work: Establishing shots of the locations Worms eye view of the helicopter Birds eye view of the swat van rolling in 180º rotation while they are on the roof of the bank POV shot of the worm cameraIncorrect Science: A sniper tries to take down a helicopter using a .50 Caliber Rifle, he tries hooting at the rotor and takes down the helicopter. This is incorrect or highly unlikely at best because the air around the blades is displaced so much that the wind around them would throw any bullet off course. In the sewer scene the SWAT guys try and use a claymore mine to blow the hinges of a door, this is also incorrect because claymore mines are a type of fragmentation weaponry, this means they fire out shrapnel and are used for their injuring power and not their explosive power. Overall Feel: You get to see the fall of two SWAT officers and then see their re-birth once they complete training again and get to grow with their new group. Along with seeing how some of them turn on each other at a moments notice. It starts out as a buddy cop movie but then changes into something different.

135,snow0r,A walking cliché?,5,20 January 2006,"It's difficult to review action movies fairly. SWAT was never going to be a classic; this sort of this has been done to death, especially in recent years, and ultimately SWAT struggles to throw in anything new or inventive without looking contrived. See ""landing a plane on a bridge"" for details.There's nothing striking about any of the characters which makes it difficult to judge acting; we've seen the clichés before, the team rivalry, the betrayal, the stickler chief, the fat cops, the old pro, etcetera. If anything, perhaps SWAT is guilty of spending too much time on this; we don't really need to know about Colin Farrell's break-up, or see him throw up after a particularly vigorous workout, or Michelle Rodriguez's kids... It just interrupts the action we've been promised from the trailer and unnecessarily extends the viewing time.The action sequences are SWAT's strongest point. They aren't special, or particularly tense, and I'm not a huge fan of the ""jerk the camera everywhere to make the audience feel like they're there"" action cameras that helped ruin Resident Evil 2, but that aside, you can't really complain.

Robert Urich blows away any effort Colin Farrell put on.This movie was also alarmingly stereotypical in more than one place as well. Gee, the hispanic woman is a single mother.  Nice how they play a Paulina Rubio song at her daughter's birthday party.  Also, how ridiculous was the entire character of Captain Fuller?  He fit the ""Pompous Ass Captain"" mold to a tee.  It reminded me of The Last Action Hero where they make fun of the fact that the captain is always portrayed as some moron who knows nothing, yet somehow became captain anyway.

I am wondering why Steve Forest lowered him self to even be in this movie not to mention Trebeck, are there careers in that much Jeopardy that they are reaching for straws? This movie had a lot of hype that died at the door to the theater, it relied on using big names that tried to work with a poor script that relied on a lot of action and no story. If you want to see SWAT then get the original series, it may be outdated and a bit slow by 21st century standards but it is a better value then this attempt at being a movie, I hope that they do not add insult to this by even thinking of making a sequel.

140,quatermax-1,Certainly don't buy it...,3,7 February 2008,"What can I say  This movie goes to great pains to illustrate how the 'elite force' of the LAPD gets to be the best Special Weapons And Tactics team on the planet. We see their intense training schedule; their professional and essential teamwork skills; their marksmanship; how they work hard and play hard, etc., etc. But then what happens? It all goes out of the window in an end game which is all personal grudges, disorganisation, one-on-one fights and basically a shambles, where luck, more than any 'elite' professional judgement wins the day, if they've even won at all.Some French 'Most Wanted' (they could just as easily have named it after this other series, and no doubt this title will inevitably appear if this trend of retro movies continues) criminal, upon capture, announces through the media (a la Mel Gibson's RANSOM) that he will offer $100 million to anyone who will free him. Our newly formed SWAT team are given the charge of escorting him to a secure lock-up. So the games begin, as various factions go for the prize, including some of the supposed good guys.Finally, after the usual pyrotechniques, gun battles and chases, the good guys manage to deliver their man to the State Pen  but his $100 mill offer is still on the table, so, unsatisfyingly, it's left open ended.It's a reasonable actioner which starts very promisingly, but the second half is a total let down. We should have been working up to the ultimate SWAT scenario, where all the skills we've seen demonstrated in the training sessions are put to the test, but it never happens.I also have a problem working out which universe it's meant to take place in. Obviously based on the 70's ABC TV series, it makes several references to it: Barry DeVorzon's original TV theme music is incorporated prominently in Elliot Goldenthal's score; the characters even sing the tune in celebratory fashion at a party when they know they've finally made it as a SWAT team. Fair enough, they obviously remember the old TV show, and one of the characters is later shown watching it on TV at home where past star Steve Forrest introduces himself as SWAT leader Harrelson. But wait a minute - isn't that his own Sergeant's name? Wouldn't this, and also the fact that most of the other members of the TV SWAT team (Street, 'Deke' and TJ) also have the same names as his 'real life' colleagues, seem a little weird? And, assuming then that the old TV series IS a part of their universe, why doesn't anyone recognise that their SWAT truck driver is, guess who, the aforementioned Steve Forrest? Or have they just made the old guy an honorary member of the team? Nice touch, but what happened to the old 'suspension of disbelief'? Okay, you can do that kind of thing if you're playing it for laughs (like Glaser and Soul's cameo in the STARSKY & HUTCH remake), but this isn't, and why do they have to have the same names as the characters in the TV series anyway? Disappointing. Even the presence of Sam L. and Farrell can't resuscitate this one. Rent it only if you can find nothing better, or simply want something mindless to watch.Certainly don't buy it. In fact the old SWAT TV series is now available on DVD and is probably more entertaining and better value for money.",S.W.A.T.
141,swipht1,Pretty good movie,10,19 August 2003,"This was a fine movie. Well done action sequences, with a well thought out storyline.

No extreme expectations, even though Jackson and especially Farrell have a fair track record. Yet it still managed to be really disappointing. Everything about this flick is just not enough to make the viewer shift in his seat. (Well maybe your girlfriend, I've heard Farrell is eye-candy in this one.) The storyline is so utterly predictable, it never requires more than a few braincells to know what's coming next. The acting is tame, bored, everybody just seems to want to go home and have a beer instead. Without this being a spoiler, if I say: eager having-to-prove-themselves-worthy S.W.A.T members, a wary chief, a (former) colleague, turning rogue, wealthy rich absolute stereotype bad guy arrested early on in the movie and you and maybe even your pet hamster easily can join up the dots. All that's left is the action scenes. And yes, you have seen better, a gazillion times at least.Waste of your time, really. I ticked the spoiler check-mark simply because telling the basic storyline equals spelling out the entire movie. Don't blame me, I'm just the messenger here.",S.W.A.T.

146,salmon62,Far-fetched and inaccurate portrayal of SWAT in LA,2,1 December 2012,"This story is so far out that it overshadows the acting of Sam Jackson. People, as much as the producers brag about technical accuracy and how the cast ""trained with actual SWAT officers"", the terribly written screenplay asks anyone over 11 to make a huge leap of faith to believe the plot.Things like this don't happen! And Police Departments like this don't behave this way! We see several scenes of the tightly-knit , newly formed five -person team working hard, then partying off-duty, then apparently driving home to sleep it off and await another day. The stereotyping is very bad.Example? An international terrorist financier makes a plea for help in escaping and within 2 hours several diverse gang groups devise highly-technical rescue strategies and attempts bringing the LAPD to its knees! These gang homies apparently have the ability to hire people to pose as City workers, homeless people, and others to devise their rescue plans against large protection entourages with complex counter-surveillance routing through the streets of Los Angeles.So, a five-person SWAT team is given complete autonomy to conduct transportation, rescue, and investigation of said terrorist, while Federal authorities, the people traditionally tasked with such incredible operations, show up in the very end to observe!Hundreds of people are hurt in a several seemingly mass casualty shootings and car wrecks, yet very few actually die despite carnage from the streets of Baghdad! A rescue of the terrorist is attempted by one of the SWAT team members who apparently believes that he can orchestrate a rescue and fly the terrorist out of the country, and that the terrorist will pay him millions of dollars. A chase involving the LA Metro system and a sewer chase stretch even a little -leaguer's capacity to believe. Add to that the macho, phony images, and ""Jerry Bruckheimer-style"" back stories for the cast, and well, SWAT goes waaaaay over the top!",S.W.A.T.

Half way through the film I had to stop the DVD because I felt so bored (anyway, I did watch the whole film) and do something else. I'm glad that I didn't waste my money in the cinema for this piece of sh!t.And what I thought was really bad, that the filmmakers couldn't get a native as the villain, but it had to be a French guy, their new `enemies' as the French didn't join the Americans in their war against Iraq.If you like mindless action films, watch xXx instead, that film at least does not take itself so seriously.",S.W.A.T.
148,stamp1,"This movie was terrible, one of the worst action movies ever!",4,10 August 2003,"The film was boring. It was SO PREDICTABLE!!! I knew who the betrayers would be halfway through the film. The plot was terrible, and it took about an hour for the film to get going, the character set-ups were too long and drawn out, AND I didn't care about them anyway. But worst of all, several of the characters (or maybe the actors instead) were extremely irritating and obnoxious!!! I wanted the police captain, played by Larry Poindexter?, to be shot by his fellow officers in a ""friendly fire"" incident, I couldn't stand him. If the movie had been true to life, he would have been the first killed somehow. I don't know if the actor is this irritating in real life, or if the director wanted him to be obnoxious, or if the writers wrote the script that way, but I wanted to get up and leave the movie to get away from having to watch his scenes. The villain, Olivier Martinez?,  was the worst acting job for a villain this year. Again, he was so irritating, why didn't the other actors just shoot him when they met him, so we wouldn't have had to put up with his terrible accent and horrible acting. Yes, both of them were handsome and were maybe in the film as eye candy for the ladies, but they ruined this film. THIS WAS THE MOST IRRITATING MOVIE OF THIS YEAR!!!!!!If you want to see great villains this year, see Hugo Weaving in ""Matrix 2"" or Kristanna Loken in ""Terminator 3"". (Both of them played villains with no emotions, and even then, they were better actors and better villains!!) Also see Geoffrey Rush as the evil pirate captain of ""Pirates O T Caribbean"" who was just FANTASTIC!!Only ""The Recruit"" and ""Phone Booth"" (both starring Colin Farrell), were worse action movies this year. Go see ""Pirates of Carribean"" or ""Cradle 2 To The Grave"", or ""Terminator 3"", or ""The Italian Job"" or ""Lord Of The Rings 2"", or ""XMen 2"" for better action flicks. Even ""Laura Croft 2"" and ""LXG"" and ""Bulletproof Monk"" were more fun to watch!! I haven't seen ""Gigli"" or ""Justin and Kelly"", but I bet they weren't as aggravating to sit through as this terrible movie was!This movie is a long drawn out boring TV episode. Don't pay more than $1 to see it at a dollar movie theater. Or you will feel ripped off like I felt. I enjoyed ""Seabiscuit"" and ""Finding Nemo"" much more than this film. Go see them instead, YOU'LL HAVE A LOT MORE FUN!!!",S.W.A.T.
149,DarkLugia1969,You're SWAT or you're not,8,28 August 2003,"Note:  These comments may have spoilers inside so you have been warned!!!     The movie S.W.A.T is based on a 1970's television show that lasted at least two season due to its violent content.  The movie was simply very good especially the actors/actresses Colin Farrell, LL Cool J, Michelle Rodriguez and Samuel Jackson who uses the original shows characters (Jackson-Hondo, Farrell-Street and LL Cool J-Deke).     The group mentioned above, in my opinion, did a excellent job of being a tight-knitted group of the best in police tactical arsenal.  The storyline very original and the fight scenes were good.  The special effect meshes well with the action and you better believe that they may be a sequel.     Why the network executives that claim that the 70's S.W.A.T series was too violent is still a mystery to me and the older fans.  The old S.W.A.T fan will definitely enjoy the movie as well as the old theme music for the show.     The Dark Gengar rates this movie from one Gengar to Ten Gengars:  An Eight Gengars.

It is definitely a guy movie, because there is not much of a plot and there is about 5 total minutes of drama in the movie. But the tactics, accuracy of the teams and the action is sweet. Oh yeah, I would watch this movie again it was so great. The supporting actors (and actress - you go girl!) to a great job as well.Complaining...I don't know what I could really complain about. The movie was what it was and that was all there is to it. Like I said though, I really liked it and there was some cool plot turns and action going on throughout the movie.

151,shinymc_shine,Cut Ten Minutes Of Character Development And Get Back To Me,8,23 December 2003,"""S.W.A.T."" is a loud, crowd-pleasing action movie, with good set pieces, which is helped greatly from the presence of Samuel L. Jackson and Colin Farrell.The movie comes off as a expensive pilot for a non-existent television show. The main plot deals with an international criminal arrested on a minor charge who must be transported to a major correctional facility. On the way he declares that he will pay $100,000,000 to the person that springs him from the protected custody of the s.w.a.t. team. This premise holds alot of promise and it certainly delivers. What is needed is more action and less character development.Jackson and Farrell are both charismatic performers who bring this type of material up a notch. The rest of the actors are serviceable but you can't help but think that there is a large dose of political correctness injected into the casting of these characters. Nice in-jokes for fans of the t.v. shows ""S.W.A.T."" and ""Homicide: Life On The Street"".Good theatrical directing debut from Clark Johnson who obviously has learnt alot about police officers and their actions (training and procedure) from working as an actor and later director on ""Homicide"" and not to mention directing the first episode of ""The Shield"" .The central idea of anyone and everyone in America being tempted by the idea of earning $100,000,000 to save a criminal from police forces is a great one but the need to show the s.w.a.t. team interacting with each other outside of work is a waste of time. I understand that red herrings need to be sowed into the story to create a sense of mystery but a good 10 minutes could be cut from the movie to make it tighter and more exciting.",S.W.A.T.

153,ChrisMIN43211,By the numbers stuff,7,25 August 2003,"Going in to see SWAT, I knew I would be expecting some fireworks. Because, of course an international fugitive (Olivier Martinez) declares he will give $100 million to whoever breaks him out of prison- a fact well established in the previews.Colin Farrell stars as one of L.A.'s finest demoted from SWAT to an action-free job due to his actions in a hostage crisis.  The ever-reliable Samuel L. Jackson is brought in to put together a group that includes Michelle Rodriguez and LL Cool J. Seeing that Farrell is a natural, Jackson gives him a second chance.Directed by Clark Johnson (a cast member of the very-overlooked TV series Homicide:Life on the Street) SWAT feels like another predictable by the numbers cop thriller, yet with Martinez' declaration, things start to come alive. An ex-partner of Farrell's decides to take a shot, and for the last half of the movie you've got few, if any, surprises. It is worth watching, but just know what to expect.",S.W.A.T.

There are many things good about this movie and not just the theme song.

Are the action scenes over the top? Of course they are.  But, is SWAT worth watching? Well.I'd have to say yes.  If you want massive gun battles and big explosions, this is definitely the movie for you, but do not expect much more than that.Basically this movie revolves around a criminal who offers $100 million to anyone who could free him, and it is up to the SWAT team to make sure he does not get away.  One of the things I liked about the movie (other than the obvious gun fights) is the interaction between all the SWAT team's characters, who seem to have some real chemistry between them. Unfortunately, we don't get to delve any deeper into the characters on an individual level, and their motivations for being so eager to join the team.This movie does not strive to be much more than a display of constant gunfire, and to be honest that's okay with me.  The battle scenes in this movie often had me on the edge of my seat.  Ultimately this movie is a forgettable one, but it is great while it lasts.I give this film 7 out of 10.",S.W.A.T.

It is a straight forward, boring S.W.A.T. team-action movie, without any interesting twists to the plot. The one that does come is so obvious that it just makes it that more pathetic.Colin Farrell does what he does, and you can't expect more than that, but from the likes of Josh Charles (my hopes are always high after he did extremely well in Dead Poets Society) and Samuel Jackson you can expect more. Not just in terms of acting, but also in terms of the quality of the movie they appear in.I fear that the next stop for Mr. Jackson will be Scary Movie 4 - and then you can't dig further than that.I rate it 3 out of 10 (on the standard 10-scale).

Samuel L.

Everyone else is ordinary at best, and Jeremy Renner is just plainbland as the ex-partner gone sour.The action sequences are richly shot, and show imagination more often than not.

I thought the US audience had matured enough to leave this sort of yeehaa patriotic rubbish alone.Nothing much happens for the first hour, character building (not that any of the cast had a character) and scene setting. Then the second hour is spent with a big explosion, car chase, shooting, fight scene which is usually great for Arnie and Bruce but not for this lot. That is it. I really wanted the badies to win.

164,phil0011,"Oh! How obvious - but strangely, I'm hooked",7,16 December 2003,"7/10There is so much wrong with this film that it's going to be difficult to explain to you why I enjoyed it as much as I did. And, don't get me wrong, the good points will follow after the next paragraph; patience.Every plot turn, every character, and every choice in this movie is predictable: right down to the one-on-one punch-up in the last scene. Now, a predictablemovie can surely never be a good thing. It's why films with twists are always held in such high regard  we, as an audience, like to be surprised. The Usual Suspects is a great film, but would it be considered so if not for the twist? M. Night Shyamalan is a making a career out of films with twists. So when an action film does nothing that Lethal Weapon didn't do 15 years ago, you'd expect awell-informed audience to let out a rather long and loud sigh. But this film can be considered as something of an achievement. Now, let me try and explain toyou why.This is Clark Johnson's directorial debut, and he handles the film with ease and style. Each scene is well set up and easy to understand  with a refreshingsense of realism added in. I get the feeling that what happens here couldhappen in real life (discounting perhaps the last 30 minutes)  now, this allows me to be sucked into the film. We get to see some kind of tactics and policeprocedures allowing us to understand any plot developments (something thatwas certainly overlooked in Bad Boys II  this is a kind of Bad Boys II meets Training Day). While managing to keep the facade of macho gun-toting idiocy,the film has an underlying, difficult to see, intelligence. You do have to look hard and wade through some of the cheesy dialogue, but I'm pretty sure that I saw it (""No roll?"" asks one man to Sam Jackson. ""They only roll in Jon Woo movies,not in real life,"" he replies). The action scenes are punctuated with such a high energy and pace  thingsnever seem to be quiet with this S.W.A.T. team. The cast does well to keep us interested in what's happening (again, Colin Farrell puts in a great performance  the brand new superstar who came from nowhere).So, there I sat for 2 hours knowing fully well what was going to happen. This director still managed to draw me in, however. Now, I think that's a sign of a filmmaker who's going to go far.",S.W.A.T.
165,bdavis-5,"Good, but not great.",7,9 August 2003,"7/10. I think that S.W.A.T. fails to be great, but it is still good. Its premise is great: a billionaire criminal throws out an $100-million reward for his escape from police custody. While the story of what makes him do that unfolds, the parallel story of the genesis of a young SWAT team is interwoven. It's good scripting with mostly plausible characters in mostly plausible situations. The acting is very good, especially from Farrell and Renner, and the directing is good enough overall. However, there are flaws, and they became more prominent for me as the film reached its conclusion. *** SPOILERS *** The Sanchez character seems to be there just so that there can be a feminist romantic interest among the leads, and she takes the place of what could be a more plausible and interesting male character. The role of the beautiful, elite warrior-mother is so rare in real life that it doesn't belong in a movie that pretends to be realistic, and it should be a worn-out cliche by now in entertainment. Another worn-out cliche is the personal, man-to-man climax between former partners, although this could be excused on the basis that the old TV series used that device, too. And why didn't Gamble just kill Sweet when it was easy to do so when he captured Montel or stabbed Sweet? I know - a Hollywood thriller must, by law, have a prolonged, personal, man-to-man struggle to end a prolonged sequence of action set-pieces. But the worst flaw is the movie's failure to properly use its main asset - the extraordinarily dynamic, hit theme from the TV series. The Mission Impossible movies exploited their memorable theme, so what was the problem here? S.W.A.T. uses an old Rolling Stones tune. It uses a variety of tunes from other artists. Its incidental themes sometimes tease the old theme. But, apart from an useless old clip briefly shown on a TV (which helps to establish that the movie is actually outside of the universe of the series it is based on, as does the celebration scene where the group mimics the theme), the theme is never fully exploited in either its original or reworked orchestrations. And that is a crime. ;)",S.W.A.T.

It's not hard to see why.As a growing fan of action movies, I can appreciate this movie. Though I'm not such a big fan of flying bullets all around, there are some respectable chase scenes and some great explosions. The plot is actually not as mindless as most action films go, and even pretty clever. A criminal is sent to prison and is caught on many news stations saying that he's offering one million dollars to whoever breaks him out of jail. Then it is up to the S.W.A.T. team to stop all of the attempts to free him while still trying to get him out of the city.Decent acting all around, a fairly bad script (but then what do you expect?), and a well-known and very attractive cast including Colin Farrell, Samuel L.

The story despite having some a few twists here and there is straight forward - you could go to the toilet and leave without being lost in the story.

Its balls tightening exciting and very edgy. And this edge doesn't cease throughout the rest of the films action sequences.the story is a high concept one to. A french mobster is arrested and sentenced to jail time. News cameras follow the story and on air he announces a 100 million dollar reward for those who free him. And naturally everyone from here to Guantanamo bay is out to rescue him. Its retarded simple but as a device to move the story it does the job quite well.Acting is not really a requirement of an action film such as this but excellent turns from Jacksons hard ass mentor and Farrells skilled student has a sense of chemistry about it.In conclusion, s.w.a.t is a mar mite film. Some will love its high paced action and high production values but others will find it to simple for there highly sprung college educated minds to care. but its a perfect night in action film best watched in its newly released blue ray format for the added sound levels and better view of those amazing shoot outs.Add another star if you have a blue ray player.",S.W.A.T.
173,QuintHooper,good all around,7,12 September 2003,"When I saw the preview to SWAT, I feared that I had just viewed the entire film (you've seen those previews!)  I was pleasantly surprised to find out that the film still had plenty left for me in the theater.  Farrell, Jackson, Rodriguez and LL let you see more into their characters than just muscle, explosions, and shell casings hitting the floor.  Different plot layers come together nicely to bring you a decent story line.  And the film brings some new elements along with the oldy but goodies.  Good, but still just a 6.5 out of 10.",S.W.A.T.
174,Loubear,Super Wicked Actionpacked Terriffic!,10,30 December 2003,"You don't believe everything that comes out of Colin Farrell's mouth! Considering he said this movie was a ""Piece of Crap"" is one example. P.S- Probably one of his best so far!)Great movie that has action from the start. Gives you an insight into what SWAT do.Good cast- you can't go past Mr Cool himself.(And I'm not talking 'bout LL Cool J! Although he was good) Samuel L Jackson puts in another good performance as the SWAT team leader.If you want 2 hours of action a plenty go see SWAT!",S.W.A.T.

176,abdullahwaqar,Kinda boring,5,14 June 2019,This thing made this movie kind of boring was how uninspired and how the 2-3rd act is just a giant chase scene where the main villain is constantly caught and just keeps escaping like every 10 minutes.,S.W.A.T.
177,JapaneseDad,Good action film..,8,2 January 2004,"This film is absolutely predictable and cliched.  A politically correct cast forms a SWAT team and has to escort an international (French!) terrorist/criminal to a federal prison.  Unfortunately, the bad guy has promised $100,000,000 to anyone who frees him.  Violent hijinx ensue.What makes this film enjoyable is the competency of the execution.  Instead of trying to fool the audience with a million pointless and illogical twists and turns the film sets up the good and bad guys, clearly enunciates the meaning of each scene and spents its energy making sure the action scenes are as well done as possible.The first action scene, in particular, is an excellent re-creation of the real-life North Hollyword bank robbery and is extremely well put together.This film won't change your life, but it's amazing how rare an understable plot and no wire-based action is, and how enjoyable it can be.8/10",S.W.A.T.
178,grotchly,L.A.M.E.,3,7 January 2004,Some of the worst dialogue I've ever heard. The whole cast seems like they graduated from the Ben Affleck Academy of Acting. The story seems like it was written by a 15-year-old. And there aren't even any good action sequences to make up for any of this.,S.W.A.T.
179,dbean66,Perfect popcorn movie,10,24 January 2011,"I seriously had so much fun watching this. Is it clichéd yes? Is it stupid? No. First off, the performances are great. Sam Jackson is still a badass. Colin Farrel is very cool. LL Cool J does a decent job. Also Jeremy Renner was awesome.The film also worked because it didn't take itself too seriously. it wanted the audience to have a fun time. The action scenes are really fun, the effects are good, the climax is really entertaining. It's not the best action film ever. It's not the best cop movie ever. It's not the best movie ever. Even so, i got what I paid for. A fun popcorn flick. I was never bored. I never checked my watch. I was having too much fun watching this to be worried about anything else. Great entertainment.",S.W.A.T.
180,jan-nebendahl,Take a nice idea and make a bad movie out of it,4,9 June 2005,"This is one of the worst action movies I have ever seen. It makes one wonder, how the decision making process works before someone spends 80 million bucks.What is the story ? A french high profile criminal offers 100 Million Dollars to anyone who gets him out of prison. The S.W.A.T. team has to prevent it. Well, this inciting incident happens 60 minutes into the movie. Who read this script before shooting it ? The introduction drags on and on and on. Meaningless sub-plots are the main focus, as are training missions and the assembly of the team. The movie goes on and on without going anywhere. I feel really angry that anyone spent that much money on stars and special effects with such a really bad script.Why does the gangster need to be caught and arrested twice, before he makes his offer ? Why are there 3-4 training missions, before the story unfolds ? Why is every last person of the team introduced with minute long scenes ? This movie could have been a nice one. Great idea, but they just blew it. Cut 30 minutes in the beginning, and you have a movie. As it is, it is the worst dollar/enjoyment ratio I have ever seen.Don't watch this movie. It's crap. It's boring. It's predictable. The best thing is the trailer.",S.W.A.T.
181,quincymd,Do not see this movie,1,1 February 2014,"Really a waste of time, and not even worth listening to the soundtrack with your eyes shut. I do still remember the Original Show of 1975 - 1976. Saying this was based on it only can be believed by those who did not see the original. I thought Samuel Jackson was a great actor, but having taken part in this ""remake"" makes me doubt he is capable of choosing the projects submitted to him and taking the good ones. I don't even consider the possibility of a woman belonging to a SWAT team. I still believe that women should not be exposed to the dangers of this kind of police work.I haven't seen anything more disgusting than the scene of the limo chasing the executive jet and the fight in the railways. My score of 1 is due to the fact that there are no Zero or negative values on the scale. Awful is an overrating",S.W.A.T.
182,omen-9,Action? What action?,4,14 December 2003,"I don't expect action movie to be something more then a pure entertainment. I can swallow lack of logic and I can deal with stupid characters without any personality. But there are some things action movie needs like air  that is action. Explosions, escapes, fighting scenes, some tension, few surprises and good soundtrack. It's not much, isn't it? So why oh why was I denied these simple pleasures here? ""S.W.A.T."" is so boring. There are few action sequences but very unimaginative. Everything is obvious and plain that you just want this stupid movie to end as quickly as possible. I like Farrell, Jackson and Rodriguez but in ""S.W.A.T."" any piece of wood could do their job. There's no acting, there's no story there is only too loud, badly chosen music. Shame, shame, shame",S.W.A.T.
183,diver110,Never Came Together,5,23 April 2004,"This was closer to a TV show masquerading as a movie.  The characters were never really developed.  With the exception of Sam Jackson, you never really liked the heroes or disliked the villians that much.  When the very predictable ending occured, I almost wished the villians had won. I attribute this more to the directing than the quality of the actors.  Colin Farrel definitely has good screen presence, but I never got a good sense of his character.  The French bad guy, Olivier Martinex, I think could have been a really good bad guy if they had developed him more.  As it was, I almost hoped he got away.  He struck me as someone with good screen presence and talent, however.  The whole movie felt like a wasted opportunity.",S.W.A.T.
184,com-3,What a disappointment,2,22 December 2003,"The underlying theme to this film offered the opportunity for a taut, intelligent, and well thought-out appreciation of the activities of SWAT.Instead, what we are served is typical Hollywood ""Let's-take-a-premise-and-make-it-as-unrealistic-as-possible"" hogwash. The movie was boringly predictable from the outset and the excellent cast failed totally to make up for the ridiculous story-line.My recommendation? Take your money to see a different film; don't waste it on this one.",S.W.A.T.
185,Rgdemond,A good couple hours of mindless action.,7,7 February 2004,"Hey, what were you expecting, a timeless classic?  SWAT was a fun, action-packed, escapist movie.  Loosely based on the TV show of the same name, it's on par with a made for TV movie but with more action and better special effects.  Some of the dialogue was hokey and the plot took some implausible as well as totally predictable and stereotypical turns. Overall, a fun movie and good rental.",S.W.A.T.

187,asovijarvi,Better than I expected.,7,9 December 2003,"A friend of mine dragged me along to watch this movie, and while I wasn't thrilled about going to see another action movie, I somehow managed to enjoy this one. It had the all usual elements, like a good guy who loses his job due injustice, nasty foul-mouthed boss and naturally some kick-ass babe to lure in all feminist wanna-be's.I was rather amused by the choice of french villain. I bet this doesn't have anything to do with the current trend of americans disliking french. Just a pure coincidence, right?I'd say one of the strong points is, that the movie just didn't have too many pauses in the action. There's nothing more boring than action movies trying to have something intelligent to say.Anyway, if you're looking for an action flick, go see this one.",S.W.A.T.

189,kletkeman,enjoyable despite some serious flaws in the final big action sequence,6,10 April 2005,"Very enjoyable the first time you see it. Lots of fun, interesting characters, a little sexual tension, and very nice to see ""Knox Overstreet"" from Dead Poets Society becoming visible again.I saw it a second time today and found that the technical flaws in the final sequence were kind of painful.*** spoilers follow *** 1) I doubt that a Lear could land on a bridge and take off again. Especially with the cars cutting off a lot of room on one end. Minimum landing distance at maximum weight is something like 811 meters, which might actually fit on a really long bridge, but take off distance is around 2400 meters ... way too long for most bridges.2) The girl gets hit with a high powered slug in the Kevlar vest. Moments later someone stands over her and she yells in a perfectly clear voice ""I'm OK"". I'm thinking she's in a huge amount of pain since these are high powered rifles and even in movie land that's gonna make a young sound pretty injured for a while.3) The biggie ... Colin Farrell is climbing onto a train to chase the bad guy, who rushes at him and pins his hand to the car's floor with a long knife. Ouch! He then runs off yelling ""you might want to get that looked at"". So Colin rips the hand off the car with brute force! No way anyone can do that with a knife through the hand and all those tendons slashed. Then, he chases the guy down and beats the crap out of him with lots of right handed hay-makers. By now he's in shock from the pain and damage, and there is no way he can take such a repeated pounding to that hand. Finally, he gets the drop on the guy and stands 5 feet from him pointing a gun. he unloads the chamber, chucks the gun to the ground, and jumps right back into the fight with his damaged hand. On what planet would a well trained SWAT officer give up the advantage like that just to prove his manhood? Sheesh ... of course he wins and the guys dies and all is well.4) When the team is driving back to the station, another call comes over the radio. Samuel L. Jackson says that their shift is technically over for 12 hours ... so they naturally mount up to take the call. Again ... on what planet is a SWAT team that has been awake for over 24 hours (and has just had a terrible evening where they killed some of their friends) given the discretion to answer any more calls? They are called in instantly for hours of debriefing and paperwork.Luckily ... it's a fast action movie and so is still easy to like. But these are so blatant .....",S.W.A.T.
190,dynaman,Just awful.,3,26 January 2004,This could just be the worst action picture of the century. The dialogue is trite and cliche-ridden. The acting is only passable and the action scenes are disconnected and predictable. This man should never be permitted to direct any kind of movie   ----  EVER.  Silly plot.,S.W.A.T.
191,sawyoufirst,Racism runs amuck in SWAT...,1,26 January 2004,"Well this is a poor excuse for a movie. It wasn't long into this movie when I began to realize that, with the exception of the star (Colin Farell) EVERY loser, dimwit, traitor, or antagonist is white.  Meaning...the only cop that gets shot is white.  The ""terrorist"" from another country is white.  The cop that goes bad is white. The prissy, stuck up people on the plane are white.  The ""pinhead"" police captain that everybody hates is white.  The guy that commits suicide is white, etc etc etc. All the ""heroes"" (again with the exception of Colin Farrell) are African American or Hispanic.  Of course, the filmmakers had a scene where a black cop arrests a black man and a black lady in front of her house says, ""don't you have anything better to do than put another black man in jail?""  A pretty much useless, pointless scene that was obviously a cover for all the anti-white racism throughout the REST of the movie.In a time where we are to be politically correct and doing all we can to erase racism, this movie just goes and does it to the white person. Had the story plots portrayed any other race in the way they did whites, there would of been protest and outrage over this movie.  Boycotts would of taken place before the movie hit the theaters.  But I guess to these filmmakers and this film studio, racism IS okay as long as it's directed toward caucasians.As with ANY kind of racism, this was WRONG on the filmmakers part and should NOT be supported by ANYONE.",S.W.A.T.
192,BRiTbOhO83,"Screw critics...popcorn-chewin', high-shootin' fun!",8,20 July 2004,"Granted this kind of film doesn't take a rocket scientist (like Coppola or Stone) to direct, this movie delivers what we go to see...the ""ooh"" and ""watch out!"" moments that make movie-going FUN. Realistic and chocked with punchy, scoff-worthy laughs and little triumphs, I saw this movie three times and intend on adding it to my action-adventure collection...because apart from ""The Godfather"" and ""Nixon"" and such, this is the kind of movie that you watch with friends. Shouldn't all movies be watched on a friendly basis? I think so. SO bust out the Orville Redenbacher for this one, its a fun thriller for you AND your friends! And major props to the REAL S.W.A.T. cops who inspire this movie and risk their lives to serve and protect. These are everyday heroes, and honestly, this film shows them as heroes.",S.W.A.T.

ROCK.Simple and easy, and so is this film-watching experience. I've seen it twice already, and although its not exactly placed next to ""The Godfather"" or ""Citizen Kane""...it's definitely some sharp-shootin', grin-bearin' fun. MOUNT UP!",S.W.A.T.
194,hobo_hobisho,When I wasn't drooling...*spoilers*,8,26 August 2003,"*spoilers*When I wasn't drooling over Colin Farrell's extreme hot-ness, I was enjoying the pace of the film. It didn't slow down and get too sappy, although it did incorporate the emotional elements of a friend's betrayal, and briefly looked at the effect of the job on officers' families.
I liked this movie. I'd place it on the Top 5 of the movies I've seen this year. It had a small amount of humor, which is always a plus. Overall, this isn't an overly complicated film, but it's the perfect summer film because it's fun and HOT. Whew!",S.W.A.T.
195,Johnny_halbarad,No depth,6,9 December 2003,"Well, its a standard Action-Movie, which i expected more from. First afull is the part of Michelle Rodriguez to small, you can't really identify her, as a character. I wanted to watch this movie, because of the topic, i mean this is S.W.A.T! But i really expected more. But however, somehow...now for the second, there are some Action scenes in there, there is being shot, but it becomes to much different battles and tests, they should have taken out a few of them and give more intelligence, logic and time to the others. And there isn't really a climax. Ok, Street kills is old buddy, but that's about it...sergeant Hondo isn't really as the big bad chief on screen, as it is usual in such movies, there is no depth into the story.That's my comment, thanks for reading it...",S.W.A.T.
196,bloggster,A terrible excuse for an action movie.,3,6 April 2004,I have been following SWAT for a long time with eager interest. I was extremely excited when I finally got chance to see it but I realise that that was all in vain. SWAT has good premise and some great actors. But unfortunatly that is all taken away by one of the worst scripts i have even had to listen to. The dialogue is appalling. It isnt the actors fault as most of the star cast are at the tip of there form. Its just the script. Alot of the what was said was the sort dialogue that cannot be said convincingly no matter who is saying it. And on top of that the plot is extremely predictable********SPOILER ALERT******i mean come on could they have left any more clues as to who the traitor is???********/SPOILER ALERT********I was severely disappointed with this movie. Watch it if you must but dont expect anything special3/10,S.W.A.T.
197,swamper777,Good movie - worth watching more than once,8,10 February 2007,"I grew up in the '70's, and S.W.A.T. was definitely a part of that, so I was intrigued when the movie came out, and I wasn't disappointed. Obviously, movies are generally more captivating than TV series, and I wasn't disappointed there, either.I think the part I liked the most was the hard luck story involving Street. Good man, did a good job, just found himself at the wrong place at the wrong time, but he persevered. Michelle Rodriguez is amazingly empathetic and brainy, despite her ""bad girl"" routine. Jeremy Renner's win of Hollywood Life's ""Break Through Performance of the Year"" is on target, as he did a terrific job portraying Gamble.It's a fairly straightforward plot, with the usual, but quite entertaining twists and turns. It really doesn't lag anywhere but keeps on moving, and the twists, if not particularly moving, are at least entertaining.In all, I'd much rather watch this movie than a cliff-hanger ending thriller that drags you through the first 120 minutes on the promise of a ""big finale."" The finale here isn't at the end, but rather, is embedded throughout the movie itself.",S.W.A.T.
198,tayman104,Standard action flick,6,18 December 2005,"This movie is as average as it gets. Don't get me wrong it was fun to watch and a little funny at times, but it won't be remembered for sure. Colin Farell does an okay job, but it's not like his character had much depth. Farell doesn't get a chance to explore his acting abilities at all. LL Cool J (mindhunters) is in the movie along with Michelle Rodriguez (Resident Evil)and they both give average performances of two people they play time and time again. The only person who really is enjoyable to watch is co-star Samuel Jackson who plays the tough squad commander.Bottom line: This movie is an okay rental that pays good homage to the old seventies show, but nothing more.6/10",S.W.A.T.

The plot of this movie was about a fugitive who offered large amounts of money for his escape and the loopholes the S.W.A.T. team had along the way. A thing that bothered me is that this plot line happened very late in the movie. There were very few things I liked about this movie. Samuel L. Jackson did a good job. I'm glad I saw this before I opened this DVD that I got for a good price while I still had a chance to return it.",S.W.A.T.
201,maneesh8,Disappointing,4,31 August 2003,I went to view this movie with a expectation for a tight plot and some nailbiting action. I was totally disappointed. There is no plot. More than half the movie is about SWAT training which does not talk about psychological/mind training for complex urban situations and how to act in them. Training took more than 1 hr of the movie. It seems like a documentary with a back ground of rap music.Action was 2nd rated with some very close ups where you do not get to see whats happening.,S.W.A.T.
202,relentless1313,lots of action,6,1 September 2003,this film took forever to get to the main part of the story. it had lots of action and shooting and explosions but i think it was more hype then good acting. S. Jackson was as always a great performance but C.

I did not care for any of the characters in fact by the time the third act came I hoped they would all be shot, ran over or they would stop the film and the studio heads passed out some of those good drugs they took to green light this flick.

Samuel L Jackson - who really is in every movie no one knows why - acts too more bad than ever before. maybe Farrell already worked here on his bad performance in Alexander... even the action scenes were boring. s.w.a.t. = special waste and trash",S.W.A.T.

The script had holes that made the character development weak.  I usually don't care in movies like this (you don't go to a action cop movie for character development) but when it takes almost an hour and a half for the action to start, that's all you have to pay attention to. The action at the end was good though.  I gave it a 5 (my husband liked it more - he gave it a 7).  The music ROCKED though.  It's a soundtrack we will get and turn up the volumn!

Rodriguez (with typical macho-sexy-lady as in ... her many movies), but still ok to watch.This movie could've been better if :1. The story could've been better, if the opening scenes (recruiting, training) is converted to more thrilling ones.2. The villain could've have been smarter and tougher.

210,shesabear,Better Than You Might Expect,9,10 August 2003,"I will admit my bias' right up front.  I am an unabashed Sam Jackson fan and I like action films.The structure of this film was very good as compared to others in the genre. Without spoiling it for those who have not seen it, the basic story is that an international fugitive offers a huge amount of money to whom ever can break him out and get him out of the hands of the authorities.Well, that invitation does not go unheeded.  S.W.A.T.  is called into action.The character development was superior as compared to many action films. The motivation of the majority of the characters is very clear and makes sense.  The actors were very effective.I think that Clark Johnson is becoming a fantastic director.  He is a very accomplished actor and his transition through the direction of many episodes of top notch TV dramas is evident in this film.I doubt that anyone will give this film an Academy Award however taken for what it is, an action film, I gave it a nine out of ten.  I enjoyed watching it, I wanted to know what was going to happen next to the characters and that is how I want to feel at the end of a film.",S.W.A.T.
211,benjaminpweaver,A fun well-made genuine anti-cynical 2000s action movie.,9,27 August 2013,"Remember when movies in the 1980s weren't very self-aware, but they were still genuine, solid, and had a real sense of fun that didn't pound you over the head with loud dumb mindless action (you know, something that was mostly lost in the 1990s and 2000s)? This is an example of that kind of '80s movie, only it's in the early to mid 2000s. And I mean it, this movie shows the 2000s in a really good light. The real sense of fun this movie is displayed in the attitudes of the characters. Being a member of S.W.A.T. is a very serious and dangerous job, and these characters do understand that, but they still try to enjoy any moment of their training that they can showing why they love this job. As an adaptation of the original show, this movie very clearly demonstrates the respect it has for it and doesn't approach it ""ironically"" or say that it was ""so ridiculous and cheesy back then"". It properly adapts the material and modernizes it in a way that is fitting. If you want to see how cool it was to live in the early 2000s, S.W.A.T. is a really good example of that.",S.W.A.T.
212,pegward61,Nothing like the TV show,8,9 August 2003,"I would not recommend this movie for people like me who were big fans of the tv show S.W.A.T. because it totally disgraces the show. I find it hard to believe that the writer was a fan of the series because he changed all the characters personalities and left the character of Dominic Luca out of the movie entirely. There is no resemblance at all to the tv show that this movie was based on.However once I got past that fact then I really enjoyed the movie. I never found it to be lacking and it kept my interest throughout the whole movie. It was very interesting to see how the team was put together and what they had to go through to become a team. Once they were on the main assignment it was nice to see them work as a team and to have the good guys win.I would recommend this movie for anyone who just wants to see a good, fun, action packed movie.",S.W.A.T.
213,rileyfreer,Few Good Scenes,6,17 January 2004,"I thought that movie about a SWAT Team would have a little more action in it.  The beginnings scenes of them training and stuff took way too much time.  There were a few minutes of action packed goodness but that was about it, good storyline yet predictable.  I think there should have been more groups after them.  You should at least rent this movie.",S.W.A.T.

215,SmackmYackm,"Bad Boys, whatcha gonna do?",9,7 August 2003,"Call S.W.A.T.First of all, let me start by saying I went into this movie totally expecting to hate it. I'm just a little sick of seeing Colin Farrell in every damn movie that comes out lately. And while I love Sam Jackson, I was getting a little tired of his black-guy-that-yells-all-the-time acting. I was quite surprised at how well this movie and both actors, not to mention the supporting cast, shined from start to finish.The movie did such a good job at creating tension I found myself in my seat clenching my teeth as beads of sweat swelled up on my forehead. There is even a bank robbery scene reminiscent of the North Hollywood shootout, complete with shot up white sedan and full body armor wearing assailants with AK-47s, to open the movie. It was basically non stop action of what it might really be like to be a LA SWAT officer. I have nothing but respect for these every day Heroes.I only had a few gripes and they didn't really surface until I had time to think about it after the movie. You get the feeling there is a lot of history behind the characters, but its never really developed in any way. It's there and you know it, but they don't really take the time to let you into their lives.Another gripe is really very minor. It was during a scene where a motorcade gets ambushed in the streets and some of the things that happen are just goofy. It wasn't so bad that it ruined the movie as I quickly forgot about it until after the movie. It was just one of those things that had me shaking my head. The rest of the action is very well done and in no way over the top like another so-called cop movie I don't care to mention. (Read the title if you need a hint)Altogether, SWAT was a top notch movie. Great acting, great action and a great deal of tension really give the feeling of what it might actually be like to have to make the split second life or death decisions SWAT officers are faced with.",S.W.A.T.
216,starringdash,Not that bad,7,18 July 2006,"You just have to ignore the attempts at being super cool with lines like ""SWAT is the world's best blah blah blah"" and the half assed acting and just get to the action scenes which are fairly realistic and well executed. There are plenty of new and good ideas which have been pretty well executed. This movie is actually better than what it looks like in the trailers and is without doubt one of the producer's better films after a long line of ""super cool"" and ""extreme action"" crap. Fairly good entertainment value but don't go expecting anything outstanding. It may sometimes irritate you with its extreme action approach.",S.W.A.T.
217,thematrixpathofneo13,a great movie,10,3 December 2006,i thought that this movie was awesome. and of course you have Collin Ferrell's bad a** attitude and all the shooting of swat. and in the movie Colin's partner is way more bada** than he is i guess i would say Ferrel plays kind of a nerd in this.but his partner is tattooed ears pierced and just awesome in this a great movie i would suggest to rent it a good plot good writing humor but at the same time drama but a good solid movie. i do like the whole swat concept and it captures if you were in a swat officers shoes than this is pretty much what it would feel like to be rushed under pressure nervous scared get the job done i am telling you to get it it is a terrific movie,S.W.A.T.

Something for everyone and a perfect action/summer flick.  I was on the edge of my seat flinching at the action, and as the old man next to me said leaving the theater, ""Now that was a damn good movie."" Pure entertainment.  Colin Farrell is too beautiful to be believed (and are we sure he isn't really American? His accent was flawless), and Samuel Jackson too cool for school. Michel Rodriguez is without question the premiere tough movie chick.  Totally something for everyone.  Don't take little children, it is very violent, definitely for 13 and above, and no sex, or strong language, so younger teens can get their ya-yas off with this one.  Great action!

It has guns (+cool guys shooting them), explosions, a attractive woman in an important supporting role.  I watched this, and found it fun.  That's it, it's worth a viewing because it is a bit of fun.  I even saw this again upon returning from the pub with some mates who demanded something to watch which wouldnt need much brain power.  It really isnt a bad film as long as you accept it for what it is, an action movie with few surprises, staring Mr ""Flavour of the month in the movie industry"" Farrell, and his mate ""cool gun"".I give this 7/10 simply for the fact that I enjoyed watching it, not because it is a movie you'd be willing to call ""great"", because it isnt.",S.W.A.T.

The music selection is horrible, the dialogue is horrible, the plot is horrible.  They either didn't have a technical advisor or disregarded him. The SWAT members who are supposedly highly trained military/law enforcement personnel consistently fail to adhere to basic procedure, the technical flaws in the action and the overall scenario are pretty severe.  The directing is very heavy handed for about the first half of the movie, then the video effects and stuff fade into a bland scene after scene progression.  I was annoyed by the directing at first but by the finale I missed it; it at least was something to look at, once it fizzled the ASTOUNDINGLY predictable, generic plot and weak action aren't enough to be even moderately entertaining. The action wasn't engaging and climaxed clumsily, making the end seem abrupt.  I'm sure there are several points I've overlooked, so to conclude I want to say that this is one of the most consistently flawed movies I've ever seen, comparable in many ways to a Straight to Video/Made for Cable but with a big budget.",S.W.A.T.
223,goodmanhunting2003,"deceptively good, yet occasionally predictable film",7,31 May 2005,"SPOILERS AHEAD!! S.W.A.T is a deceptively good, yet occasionally predictable film. Throughout the movie, you could smell deception all the way, especially with the character called T.J. There was an uneasiness about himcall it an uncertainty, some kind of shiftinessthat rendered him an easy target for almost anything. Small wonder, therefore, that he would be the only one out of the L.Jackson/Farrell/Rodriguez/LL.Cool J/etc team to be shot during a simulation.I thought that was ominous.T.J. was a cool guy, the kind of guy who exudes a chutzpah that is unparalleled, but it was all superficial. The look on his face that someoneie Farrell's charactercould shoot better than he could was a damper to his confidence. But maybe, that was just a red herring for us viewers to think that there was going to be some serious competition among the team? In so many ways, competition there was, because in the end, T.J. let the whole team downnot because he wasn't able to overcome his chutzpah, but because he got greedy. I haven't looked lately at what S.W.A.T team members earn, but I suspect it might be quite high. The appellation associated with them""elite""speaks volumes about how that corresponds with their salary I would guess.Then again, salary structures were hardly the issue in the film, but I did find myself glued and captivated all the way through the film. I had to rush with my shower so that I could catch most of the dialogue and ascertain any clues that were so waiting to be uncovered. It was a good thing that there was a concomitant trail of the Frenchman criminal coming into the country, getting caught, killing someone, and weaving his own path of destruction as he went. Not necessarily in that order.The clincher that I found most interesting, or rather, let me rephrasethe cruxwas that call to have him released. It was rather incredulous though that news networks worldwide, in a complete shirk of their social responsibility, would give the criminal airtime for him to repeat his demand that he would give a gargantuan sum to anyone who would free him.It was amusing for the storyline though, and the punch-line at the end of the film was cute: there he still was clad in his orange clothes en route to federal prison. So for all the explosions, the banditos, and what have you that triedin vainto rescue him, he STILL went to prison.Still interesting though was the human nature aspect here.Going back to T.J., he let his human frailty of greed overcome him, and that was essentially what revolved round the storyline of greed, but as I said earlier, you could sense it coming. It was a tad too predictable. However, what was nice was the ex-S.W.A.T introduced at the beginning of the film, only to re-emerge as one of the major protagonists. You could sense that he had an axe to grind, but not this deep.Then again, wasn't he a gambler? Nice little touch there.In the final analysis, what I learnt from watching S.W.A.T  I like to think I learn from movies  is that primo, no one is indispensable (for all his kick-ass techniques, the ex-S.W.A.T. had to be kicked out of the force didn't he because of his questionable character?); secondo, humans will be humans (or in this case, boys will be boys?), what with their atavistic tendency to want to get ahead over and above everyone elsebe it by fair means or fouleven if it means conniving or contriving.; terto, everyone deserves a second chance. From Farrell to LL.Cool J to Rodriguez's character, each one of these were wallowing in their own existence, unaware that they had skills that could take them far some day. Maybe Farrell's character knew, but he had to be pushed. I liked that touch too: knowing that you are a kick-ass G.I. type, but willing to not push the envelope and draw attention to yourself. But Rodriguez's character was cute. Asked whether she was interested in becoming S.W.A.T., she intoned, ""I just like applying all the time"". Which sounds exactly like what a lady might say in that given circumstance.Once again, nice touch.Over all, the dialogue was good; the storyline refreshing, albeit a bit incredulous. As for the action, well, with L.Jackson in here, you were always going to get wit and some firepower going awry (remember ""Long Kiss Goodnight?""). Or maybe, I should have been talking about the director? Some contributors on IMDb know more about these than I could ever dream to. So I'll pass on that one. But I do have to add, by way of conclusion, that for the length of the film, it still managed to hold one's attention, and it was, frankly, refreshing to see someone as ostensibly top-notch like Farrell's character trainingwithout complaints or delusions of grandeurwith the rest of the putative/so-called ""rookies"".Another nice touch.In conclusion, there were many nice touches here, though I think the Frenchman getting caught too early was a bit of a let-down. It just seemed to show that these French cannot even make sustainable criminality do-able.But, hell, what would I know? I'm only an opinionated viewer, and I'd like to dash this film a full seven out of ten.",S.W.A.T.
224,richardhg,Implausible and predictable,1,13 December 2010,"The action scenes are utterly predictable. The good guys always win, and never get hurt. The bad guys lose every round. The scene that made me laugh out loud was where a large SUV catches up with a Lear jet on takeoff, on a bridge. The jetwash would have blown the SUV off the bridge, but instead, the SUV not only catches up, it destroys the plane. (Look at Youtube and you will see what I mean.) But then, all the way through, ""S.W.A.T."" sacrifices reality for imaginary scenarios. A sneering boy plays the Mr. Big Underworld character. The whole movie reeks of the kind of 'misunderestimation' and contempt for the skills of the bad guys and overconfidence/ invulnerability of the good guys that took the US into Iraq, and the movie is a relic of those times.

227,abemos,Typical Hollywood mainstream action movie not making the cut.,1,8 January 2004,"Ill make this pretty short and (almost) free of spoilers.
This movie is as a whole a big disappointment to me. I expected a lot from this movie since Samuel L Jackson is one of my favorite actors.The plot shows to be pretty straightforward with the usual ""good guys"" not being accepted by their environment, both because of personality and because their view on how to do things right don't comply with ""doing things by the book"". And of course our hero (played by Colin Farrel) gets to show us all that he is a sensitive guy and that he is a real American hero *yawn*.
It seems pretty clear to me that Clark Johnson (director) and the story writers wanted to make sure to ""entertain"" everyone watching it. So for all the guys taking the girlfriends to the cinema, we have to accept the usual ""good looking guy, living in the fast lane, with big cars, guns and women"". This time the woman in question is played by  Michelle Rodriguez as the hardcore cop-woman. And of course we have to witness the ""man vs. woman in a rough world"" situation. Entertainment for the lowest denominator.
All in all the story is too straightforward, the type of characters remade too many times and the type of film has been done better a lot of times since the dawn of movies like Top Gun. I'd rather go down and rent Top Gun again instead of going to the cinema to see S.W.A.T, and i know for sure my girlfriend agrees to this (she is of course also more interested in Tom Cruise :).I seriously don't understand why an action film like S.W.A.T can't be more advanced and just a bit more innovative than is the case. I feel like a cow that have just been milked for my cash when coming out of the cinema. I paid good money for what? I didn't get a good story that i haven't heard before, i didn't learn anything new and there was no philosophical aftermath that i could go home and think about, as in films like The Matrix.

Has all the ingredients of an action movie. Probably seen this plot on other movies BUT what makes this a blockbuster hit is I believe the names that bring to life these characters. Starting out with Samuel L. Jackson (then again not all his movies are that great) but, when you combine him with Collin Farrell, Michelle Rodriguez and Jeremy Renner you get this results. Looking into more details the chemistry between Renner and Farrell makes the cilmax of this film adding some old school with Jackson, and sexiness with Rodriguez, obviously comedy with LL Cool J too you can simply mix and match to get a positive result. In this case you can somehow link all their characters in order to have this movie work out and give you at the end an entertaining action movie. Maybe not the best acting, no high end special effects, not the best soundtrack (although the theme song is catchy ¨Nananaaa nananaaaa na-na-na¨ haha Well do recommend this movie to be seen and again I am not someone who study film or any of that just someone who simply enjoys movies like these.

This was a great remake, which can't be said for many who have tried recently. Like Pulp Fiction, it starts out with a bang with lots of action and tense scenes.  This pace is carried through much of the movie, although it does make some useless pit stops to show us Collin Farrell's love life problems. I'm not sure why this was included, as it was only one scene and that was it. Similarly, they could have left out his one-on-one scenes with Michelle Rodriguez, since that didn't go anywhere either. Samuel Jackson does a great job, as does the rest of the SWAT crew. However, the villain wasn't given enough screen time to make me hate him or appreciate the extent of his wickedness.

240,Seebs,"Not an action fan, but...",7,2 November 2003,"(This might contain things considered spoilers)
I went with my boyfriend to see S.W.A.T. not expecting much beyond guns, explosions, blood, and probably a sex scene with some eye-candy-of-an-actress. I actually was pleasantly surprised.Firstly, I'd never even thought of the S.W.A.T. people. If I had, I'd've assumed they were part of the military force rather than an elite part of the police.  I didn't think police would be the ones who handled terrorists, especially airplane hijackers.  I like movies where I learn little things like that I probably should have known.  :DThings were fairly predictable otherwise, though not as bad as my preconception of action movies. What I found interesting was the terrorist's brilliant announcement to the news stations on his way into the high security prison: The offer to reward the person who busts him out of custody and gets him out of the county-and the reward promised to be grossly handsome as well as entirely affordable for the filthy rich international threat.  It's not as though the 'good guys' could stop him from the unanticipated speech that was caught on video. I wanted to smack the media upside the head for airing the tempting offer on every station (even confirming the plausibility of the reward) reaching every petty thief, violent criminal, and countless desperately underprivileged people. And the just plain greedy, which the terrorist later relishes over. (`I knew I could count on the American greed' or something to that effect.)Thus the entire city of L.A. (and probably beyond) is pitted against the entire police force.  That one statement wrecked unimaginable widespread havoc! As if that weren't enough, even the superior strategy and operation intelligence were attacked by an ex-S.W.A.T. guy and a traitor within our best-of-the-best S.W.A.T. team. D'oh!Regardless of the ending which was probably predictable and included a yuck-o decapitation death, I appreciated the musing prompted by aspects I described above and enjoyed the sprinkling of humor throughout. (They could've been nicer depicting the vegan cop, but this was supposed to be for the average macho American dude.  I can see the humor, if grudgingly). For generally entertaining me, I gave this movie a 7/10.Oh, by the way. I liked that once on the team, the girl was just one of the group.  No sex scene -- sorry ;-) -- or stereotypical over-emphasis on sexuality.",S.W.A.T.
241,dmadaus,A technically flawed movie,4,31 December 2003,"I am always suprised at how writers in Hollywood assume that the average movie goer has an I.Q. of about 50.  There are so many technical flaws in the picture that detracts from the potential of the plot.  Do these writers actually read what they wrote?  This movie is at best a made for TV show.

242,morrisbrad,Yes - you have seen this one before,4,30 May 2005,"Yes, you HAVE this movie before! Sorry to say it, but you could have done far more with the setting, the plot and especially the actors. But alas with all those bullets and explosions, the story was the same tired old police-tough-guy fodder we have seen so much of before.Colin Farrell reprises the same type of role he did in 'THE RECRUIT' as the against-the-odds-rookie, who, despite some early heroics falls foul of internal police bureaucracy and gets busted down to the rank of station-lakkie-boy. Then along comes Samuel L Jackson as 'Hando', the veteran SWAT sergeant who gives Farrell 'another shot at the action'. Add a pencil-pushing captain (by Larry Poindexter), hip-hop street cred with LL Cool J, edgy tough-town-gal Michelle Rodriguez and megalomaniac Latino drug lord Olivier Martinez, and hey-presto, instant cop flick.In terms of the characters, Collin Farrell sails through the movie giving a reasonably OK performance, but seems constrained by a bland character who doesn't develop much, nor seems to have much at stake apart from getting some spice into his job. Poor Samuel L Jackson... he seems completely bound and gagged by a 2-dimensional character and is capable of far more, but seems to be cornered by a lack of good material in his character. Michelle Rodriguez adds some tiny ember of romance and some character grit, and LL Cool make the most of the role and being himself (not a bad job). Martinez seems to sleepwalk through the whole experience and his character is written with such menial background, that you don't really care if he is caught. In just about all of the characters, there seems little at stake, or if there is, you have little empathy for them.The script is the main let down for this movie. It spends so much time tripping over its own shoelaces showing their training, a bit of buddy-buddy tension, some build up etc, that by the time you get to the action, there is little there to keep you engaged with the characters. What was also lacking was the 'theme' of Martinez offering the reward of $100Mil. That should have sent everyone in the streets and in the LAPD into complete chaos. Here the film could have really tested the characters moral sensibilities, but it just gets little more than a passing action sequence.After you find out who the 'insider' is, the plot rolls on under its own weight needing little thought of the view.A lot of potential with good actors and settings, just gone to waste on a lack-luster tired script.Sorry guys, but for a rating, I can only give this one three Dolph Lundgrens and one Rutger Hauer!",S.W.A.T.
243,robdavid588,displays all that is wrong with modern Hollywood,1,14 May 2005,Swat is a film that displays all that is wrong with modern day Hollywood. It scrapes the bottom of the barrel in in its search for mediocrity. It also displays the 'fast cut' editing so prevalent in most new films. Most scenes in the film last less than three seconds. This has a numbing effect and prevents the audience from getting to know the characters. It also has the effect of producing a shallow detached film that will only appeal to the external visual sense rather than engaging and becoming memorable. Many action films are intense and believable. This can only happen when one actually cares about the characters. The technical failures of this film do not allow it to happen,S.W.A.T.

The story sucked and it was so predictable. Could they of thought of something ""original?"" When I watch it, I told my husband it seemed familiar. I remember watching the original TV series. And when it was over.... then I figured it out, they took it from there. And when I heard the music I knew for sure. I can't believe Samuel l Jackson would stoop this low ....I'm shocked and disappointed. Geeze whats with money when you suck! I'm glad I didn't pay 12.00 bucks to see it or I would of went SWAT on them! Why do they even try? Who made this?.... The Charlie Angels Director?",S.W.A.T.
247,metzman69,Shambolic,3,3 December 2007,"As I sat down on a Sunday afternoon I prepared myself to watch what is described on the cover as ""The best cop film since Training Day"". Instead I found myself in front of a bastardized version of many of its genres predecessors. In Clark Johnson's first time feature film venturing off from directing TV shows he depicts a newly formed S.W.A.T team lead by Samuel. L. Jackson (Sgt. Hondo) and his newly found apprentice/muse Collin Farrell (Jim Street) babysitting a European gangster wanted by Interpol. As the French Mafioso is escorted to prison he announces he will pay $100,000,000 to whoever breaks him out. From this rather mediocre plot we witness what unfolds because of the Euro Trashes big mouth ending in one of the S.W.A.T members deferring to the other side of the law. From what could have been a good film with a bit of script tweaking and better direction is instead a complete waste of film thanks to unnecessary sub-plots, close-ups of Jackson and what I can only describe as Steven Segal B-movie acting. This is unfortunate because the film doesn't lack substance but just doesn't accomplish what could have been done with the script. Also putting LL Cool J in any film really should be a criminal offence and given castration as a penalty. I am not saying rappers turned actors cant act, look at Mark Wahlberg and Ice Cube for instance, but giving them roles securely for the result of bringing in more revenue at the box office is shambolic.",S.W.A.T.
248,dreamnscheme77,QUITE ENJOYABLE,7,8 August 2003,"Let it be said upon first seeing the trailer for S.W.A.T I had absolutely no faith in it. Granted Colin Farrel is gorgeous and Samuel L. Jackson is the man but the previews looked pathetic and a little too similar to The Recruit. Having seen it I have to say the trailer is very misleading. The action sequences were extremely well shot and beautifully choreographed. S.W.A.T. is the return to the believable cop movies Hollywood has seem to take a departure from. Obviously there is not a helicopter falling out of the sky everyday in L.A. but the chase and fight sequences are not full of unpractical martial arts and moves only an acrobat on crack could pull off. Samuel L. Jackson's colorful character even makes reference to that when he pokes fun at the summersaults trainers are doing by saying they ""only work in a John Woo movie"". At the heart of the action the young and talented cast are very interesting to watch. They are all playing the typical roles but without each one's delivery of the velveeta filled lines the movie would be incomplete. Farrell plays the maverick better than anyone, LL Cool J is the sleekest tough guy on screen this summer, and Michelle Rodriguez as always plays the give-the-men-a-run-for-their money character perfectly. S.W.A.T. did not come out in the typical height of the summer blockbusters but it the perfect way to close out your summer movie visits.",S.W.A.T.
249,astronut84,absolutely devoid of plot,3,2 September 2003,"Based on action sequences and special effects alone, SWAT was a pretty good movie, and if that's all you're interested in seeing, you will probably enjoy it.  However, the story line is sporadic at best.  Basically, this is just an excuse for Colin Farrell and Samuel L. Jackson to blow stuff up, and while they do a pretty good job of it, they leave the audience wanting more. Definitely not worth the 10 bucks to see it in the theaters.  If you must, catch a matinee, or just wait until it comes out on video.",S.W.A.T.

The character interactions and the development of Farrel's character made for a lot of ""possible"" interesting story lines.  Unfortunately in the end it became your run of the mill ""knock em sock em action movie with guns a blazing, car crashes, and explosions"".  This movie had a lot of potential and could have been much better, then again I did expect an action movie. This is a ""fun"" movie, like eating a snicker's bar, great when you have it, but nothing special that you must have.",S.W.A.T.
251,mountainboy,Didn't Inspire Me to Sign Up As a SWAT Recruit,1,16 August 2003,"The story is poorly written, the acting wooden, the direction ummm, well WHAT direction?!  If you're looking for a good action flick, maybe not great in terms of deep meaningful insights into life, but big on explosions, exciting chases, mano a mano 2 fisted colt .45 justice, then this isn't it...its SLOOOOOOW.  Painfully slow.  As for the acting, because of the awful storyline the actors aren't given a lot to work with, and that is unfortunate, because Samuel L. Jackson deserves better than this lame ""Get Tough on Terror"" vehicle.  The one bright spot in this film is the performance of Colin Farrell as the main protagonist.So, no appreciable character development with a badly written storyline, racing along at a snail's pace, 1-dimensional dialogue and 1-dimensional acting....this film was a waste of my time.  The original TV series of SWAT was superior and would be much better at recruiting young blood into the forces.",S.W.A.T.
252,biefcamp,IMDb is wrong,6,4 July 2007,"In IMDb's review of SWAT, they state in the Trivia section that when the Television shows Olvier Martinez' character being arrested, he is seen laying down on Alex Trebek's Star on the Walk of Fame and that Trebek's voice is heard doing the news broadcast. That is wrong! Anyone who has lived in Los Angeles knows that the Broadcaster's voice is none other than KTLA's own Hal Fishman! GEEZE, I expected them to get that little fact right! LOL. Otherwise, I think the movie was good especially the surround sound style effects of the shoot out at the beginning. The only problem I had with the movie was that I think Samuel Jackson's acting seemed a little too scripted, or as some say in the Biz, ""phoned-in"". Just a thought.",S.W.A.T.

You just sit there wondering, ""Is there real action is this movie?.""  My title indicates this movie is the opposite of Bad Boys 2.  Now, I realize that Bad Boys 2 is not a fantastic movie.  However, going into Bad Boys 2 I expected two things:  1.  Great action.  2.  Funny.  It delivered, that was all I wanted.  I went to SWAT expecting some of the same and got neither.  They showed more training then actual action; the characters were ridiculous, and the dialog was insulting it was so predictable and stupid.  Bad Boys 2 never let up (it couldn't it was soo long).  This movie seemed like it was 4 hours.  Ebert said this was the best since Training Day, yet again proving his complete stupidity. Training Day was a great movie, this was an absolute waste of time and money.",S.W.A.T.

Also the scene of actions had very real and hard.Probably it becomes addicted to first watcher. Actor's performances were charming. Conclusion was very surprised me.

Though, there was some doubt in believability, I still think that you couldn't have gotten a better performance from a cast like this.And at that time, when this came out, it really seemed like there wasn't much to compete against it. Meaning, it seems like this film energized the movie scene at that time. In my opinion, it was the film of the year.It definitely captured the reality of what real S.W.A.T crews do and I give the director and the screenwriter a lot of credit for presenting such a realistic view of this amazing line of work.",S.W.A.T.

Completely filled to the top with cliché's, already used in every other police-action-movie. Nobody has even tried to cover up the parallels with Speed, Money Train and tons of bad Eddie Murphy movies.Every attempt to put any feeling or depth into S.W.A.T. fails miserably, like the ""love relationships"" which remain completely in the background of all the useless, unrealistic violence and action.If you liked Speed, go rent that one again rather than spending your money on this.",S.W.A.T.

Jackson, Colin Farrell, Michelle Rodriguez, LL Cool J, Brian Van Holt, Jeremy Renner & Oliver MartinezThe Review: Not many movies can establish what this movies does. It establishes a small love triangle with a fight to preserve a wanted criminal from being busted out of police custody. The premise is extraordinary yet slightly unoriginal. I saw the movie at an advanced screening in San Fransicso and loved every minute of it.The story is about Alex Montell, a wanted drug kingpin who's arrested by the LAPD and taken into police custody. Because he has been known to be very dangerous and elusive, the police chief calls in veteran cop Lt. Dan ""Hondo"" Harrelson and orders him to gather the best and brightest to make up an elite S.W.A.T. team to transport Montell into the hands of the Feds. Among the S.W.A.T. team men (and women) chosen is Jim Street, a hot shot cop who is always messing up at work and away from work, is told that if he screws up in this mission, he's gonna have to look for a new job. With the team together, they begin transporting him, but in the midst of several newscasters, Montell offers 100 million dollars to anyone who can break him free from S.W.A.T.'s custody. With an ex-S.W.A.T. member on their tail, ready to bust out Montell and get $100 million dollars richer, the S.W.A.T. team must band together to stop Montell from escaping custody.As you see, the plot intertwines between all of the characters and the characters intertwine each other. It's simply just a slightly complicated movie. Colin Farrell is excellent as Jim Street. I'm a big fan of his and he's the reason I went to see the movie. And I hope you'll see it too.**** (Out of *****)",S.W.A.T.

I'm not much of an action fan, but I still thought this movie was great! I was pleasantly surprised that this wasn't just another cheesey action flick, but much more! Along with the edge-of-your-seat gasp-worthy high-action scenes, there was also a fair amount of comedy that had the audience laughing and made the film relatable. The casting was excellent, Samuel L. Jackson and Colin Farrell giving the most memorable performances. One thing that made SWAT different from the average popcorn movie is that it had a real story line that actually made you CARE about the characters. The personalities in the film were well developed.

By the end of the movie both me and my wife (practically the only people in the theater) were finishing out the sentences... typical punch lines ,and bad delivery.(LL  please stick to rapping). Odd transitions and bad shot compositon annoyed me through out the movie. Who allowed the DP to shoot such crappy shots and get  away with it!Did they not watch the dailies? But the biggest heartbreak of all is watching Samuel L Jackson do another bad movie, this is a man who was on his way to being a legend in his own time, until he started  taking every lousy part that paid well. What happened to actor who brought such characters as Senor Love daddy, Jules or Gator alive. He obviously has lost his edge.

I found that the realness was lacking as well.  We all know L.A.P.D. cops wouldn't be in that much control, most likely, the FEDERAL bureau of investigation would take over for international fugitives.  I think this movie was just another attempt at a special effects blockbuster, and had the star quality, although poorly acted.  Colin Farrel's character lacked depth, we don't see any true relationship between he, and his partner.  Then there is Samuel L Jackson. Jackson has played almost the same role in half of his movies.

Montel was a well-known French terrorist and he visited his uncle who had all the properties for being an Italian (!): the accent, the restaurant, the bodyguards. They could have done this a lot better in order to make the movie a lot more credible. Furthermore was the ending way too long and too standard.
