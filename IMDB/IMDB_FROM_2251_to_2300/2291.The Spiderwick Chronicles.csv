0,TheLittleSongbird,Excellent movie!,8,24 May 2009,"I wish people would stop comparing this to Harry Potter, because this is a dark and hugely entertaining film, that both kids and adults will enjoy. I am not saying Harry Potter isn't entertaining, it just is a little unfair to compare movies that are completely different, with the fact they are fantasy being their connection. The film itself looks just stunning, with beautiful sets and costumes.(the house in this film reminded me of the house in The Others) Young children will find Mulgarath a bit too sinister, especially in his ogre form, but he was essential to the plot. I think how he died, getting eaten in the form of a crow by the good goblin(can't remember his name) a bit disappointing, as I've known villains to die better than that. The script is very like Princess Bride in terms of wit and imagination, with the book and all the other basic ingredients. The story is very imaginative, with a boy finding a book and accidentally unleashing the evil goblins who want the book for themselves. What made this movie was the cast, Freddie Highmore, Mary Louise Parker, Nick Nolte, Joan Plowright and Martin Short, all giving first rate performances. While not his best work, James Horner's score was appropriately fitting to the action. Another thing, before I round off, is that I found the ending with the father and daughter reunited really poignant, I almost cried at that bit. All in all, a beautiful and inventive movie, with a 8/10. Bethany Cox",The Spiderwick Chronicles
1,Leofwine_draca,Light-hearted and fast-paced kid's adventure,6,10 April 2013,"THE SPIDERWICK CHRONICLES is a perfectly entertaining children's fantasy film that provides a neat alternative to those viewers who've overdosed on Harry Potter's antics. This one is a neat, standalone tale of mythical monsters and invisible beasties, and the three kids who have to fight them in an old, crumbling house in the remote countryside.The film provides plenty of action and lots of special effects (CGI, of course), which are for the most part very well achieved. There's humour (some of which, like the Seth Rogen character, I could have done without), scary scenes, and a great deal of imagination. It's all very familiar and rather predictable - in fact, I had virtually the same idea for a story like this, once - but there's little to dislike.Okay, so the script could have been a little tighter; there's a little too much yelling and shrillness early on, before the characters of the protagonists are given a chance to come out. The casting of Freddie Highmore in the dual role is very good, though, and something I didn't spot until about halfway through. Sarah Bolger, late of THE TUDORS, is excellent as ever. The director could have been better, but as I said, there's little to dislike in this one.",The Spiderwick Chronicles
2,SnoopyStyle,Darker children fantasy,6,26 May 2014,"Helen Grace (Mary-Louise Parker) is moving back to her childhood home with her children Mallory (Sarah Bolger), twins Simon and Jared (Freddie Highmore). The father is estranged leaving behind an angry bickering family. Some 80 years ago, the boys' great-great-uncle Arthur Spiderwick (David Strathairn) discovered a secret world and was abducted by fairies according to his daughter. Jared discovers Arthur's trunk and reveals a world of magic and otherworldly creatures. There is a dark ogre Mulgarath (Nick Nolte) who is after Arthur's book.The family fighting really tired me out. THERE IS SO MUCH ANGER. Everybody keeps yelling. The mom yells. Mallory yells. Jared yells. The ogres yells. Martin Short really yells. It's the most annoying thing to watch. At least, Simon doesn't yell but I'm not sure that I like Freddie Highmore playing duo roles. I rather have the characters truly interact.This is a slightly darker children's fantasy. Both the real world and the fantasy world are filled with darker substances. It works to a large extent. Seth Rogen delivers a little bit of humor as the bird obsessed Hogsqueal. I wish there was more sense of wonder. A lot less yelling would help.",The Spiderwick Chronicles
3,Prismark10,Twin forces,5,20 August 2016,"The Spiderwick Chronicles is a family adventure but although an adaptation of a series of books it lacks the wonder of the Harry Potter films but is a decent solid adventure in its own right.A newly divorced mother Helen Grace (Mary-Louise Parker) moves with her children Mallory (Sarah Bolger) and twins Jared and Simon (Freddie Highmore) into an haunted old house in upstate New York that was once owned by her great uncle, a naturalist Arthur Spiderwick (David Strathairn) who vanished and his now elderly daughter ended up in an asylum.Jared discovers a book written by Spiderwick that has a warning which is ignored. The book is a field guide explaining that the estate is inhabited by various mystical creatures such as goblins and fairies.The evil Lord Mulgrath wants to destroy the book but the house has various protection including creatures that protect the book from falling into the wrong hands. The Grace kids embark on a magical and dangerous adventure.The film is economical and set at a brisk pace but it is no more than middling despite some indie sensibilities the film has such as John Sayles as one of the screenwriters.",The Spiderwick Chronicles
4,classicsoncall,"""There is so much about this that is not okay"".",7,22 October 2016,"I didn't know anything about this movie going in, I simply picked the DVD off a library shelf to watch with my granddaughter, she wanted something themed for Halloween and it seemed to complement a couple Scooby Do adventures positioned close by. Personally, I like fantasy stories myself, and this one turned out to be fairly creative and unique. It had it's share of unusual goblin-like creatures and had I not seen the film I would never have known that a brownie turns into a boggart when it's angry. That business with the seeing-eye ring was a clever device, and whoever came up with this stuff in the first place was pretty imaginative. The only thing that seemed a bit of a letdown after all the buildup was how easily Hogsqueal managed to defeat the Mugarath simply by eating him. I would have expected more of a battle. All in all though, a nicely paced, colorful story about a family that finds closure over the Mom's failed marriage, although I don't think anyone on the writing staff considered the home repair bill they'd be faced with following the closing credits.",The Spiderwick Chronicles
5,jboothmillard,The Spiderwick Chronicles,5,10 January 2011,"A year after the release of Bridge to Terebithia I think I saw a short trailer for this, at the time they both looked the same to me, after seeing Terebithia I was interested in trying this book based imagined world film, from director Mark Waters (Freaky Friday, Mean Girls, Just Like Heaven). Basically the Grace family, mother Helen (Mary-Louise Parker), daughter Mallory Grace (Sarah Bolger) and twin sons Simon and Jared (both Freddie Highmore), have moved into the old run down Spiderwick Estate. The house hides a big secret, one of the two brothers finds a key that opens a chest that contains a magical book, and the rule of reading the book is broken releasing its powers. The enemy creatures that are trying to get to the brothers, and when they believe them Mallory and eventually Helen, are stopped by the protective circle of rocks all around the house. The creatures can only be seen when they want to be seen, and the family that believe in what they see have been transported into an alternate world full of fairies, goblins, trolls, sprites and griffins. It is up to the youngsters to rid themselves of all the evil creatures they are against and find a way to put everything back to normal, including getting the help of Arthur Spiderwick (The Bourne Ultimatum's David Strathairn). Also starring Seth Rogen as Hogsqueal, Andrew McCarthy as Richard Grace, Nick Nolte as Mulgarath, Martin Short as Thimbletack and Joan Plowright as Aunt Lucinda Spiderwick. Some of the computer animated characters are likable, the story is varied, and the action sequences, when they happen, are alright, overall, I didn't find myself as gripped as I was by Terebithia, but's it's not a bad fantasy adventure. Worth watching, in my opinion!",The Spiderwick Chronicles
6,ccthemovieman-1,Special-Effects Make It Fun,8,21 August 2008,"This is another of those fantasy films that serves its purpose in that it entertains, no matter what the age. It's not among the elite in its genre, but it is a story that hooks you in by the 20-minute mark and you just go along for the ride, mainly to see how things will turn out.There is good suspense in here, enough to make adults care about what happens, not just kids. There also are some scary scenes that are probably too much for small kids, but fine for teens on up. In all, you get a good mix of horror, comedy, fantasy and drama all rolled into one odd (fantasy) story.Child acting star Freddie Highmore, who seems to get cast in a lot of these fantasies (Charlie And The Chocolate Family,"" ""August Rush,"" ""Arthur And The Invisibles,"" and ""The Golden Compass"") has a dual role in here, playing brothers ""Jared""and ""Simon Grace."" Freddie is a fine actor, so no problem in that department. I hate to hear child actors, using God's name as exclamations, though, but that's not Highmore's doing. The only other annoyance is the frequent shouting with an older sister. However, once the adventure kicks into high gear, the arguing stops as the kids try to solve their major dilemma as a unit.Nick Nolte plays the big villain, ""Mulgarath."" but his role is surprisingly small. It's all those ugly, nasty little creatures who surround the house, who are the ""bad guys."" There are a number of somewhat scary scenes involving them, enough to entertain the post-pre-adolescent crowd.The star of the film isn't Freddie or the actors, or the story.....it's the special-effects, which are very good and a lot of fun to watch, from little beings to monsters to fairies to whatever. I saw this on Blu-Ray and it really looks good. All of it is very colorful and entertaining to view, making this a film fun for both kids and adults.",The Spiderwick Chronicles
7,Tweekums,A children's fantasy film with some good scares.,8,20 January 2011,"Most children's fantasy films aim to delight and may possibly have one or two scares; this film however reverses that and has plenty of scary moments that might even have adult viewers feeling shocked. When a family move to a house in the countryside things look fairly grim; they can't even talk to each other without arguing and that is before they discover that their home is surrounded by goblins determined to get their hands on a book written by a distant uncle of the family. The book details all the supernatural creatures its author observed and had been left in the care of a friendly creature called Thimbletack, unfortunately when new arrival Jared discovered and read the book the goblin Mulgarath was alerted and he sets about trying to get the book. He can't enter the protective circle around the house but the family can't remain inside forever and when they come out they are in extreme danger.This film had a lot more scares than I'd expected from a PG rated film; none of them were serious enough to mean it wouldn't be suitable for children who like a good scare; more timid ones might want to give it a miss though. The acting was pretty good, particular note must be made of young Freddie Highmore who played both Jared and his twin Simon. The creature effects were excellent; I particularly liked the flower fairies even though they only appeared in one small scene. There was no real gore of course but a couple of the children received nasty gashes that might make the viewer wince and the scene were Jared apparently stabs his father may be too much for some.",The Spiderwick Chronicles
8,BA_Harrison,"Goblins, faeries, and ogres, and not a Quidditch match in sight (hurrah!).",8,20 September 2008,"After moving into the creepy house that belonged to their crazy Aunt Lucy, young Jared Grace (Freddy Highmore) discovers a mysterious book that reveals to him all of the secrets of an invisible world full of magical creatures. Along with his twin brother Simon (Freddy Highmore again!) and older sister Mallory (Sarah Bolger), he must fight to keep the book from falling into the hands of Mulgarath, a nasty ogre who would use its knowledge for evil.Whilst it might not be perfect, feeling a little rushed in places (apparently the contents of several books were condensed into this one film), The Spiderwick Chronicles packs more genuine magic and wonder into its 100-ish minutes (depending on the version you are watching) than all the Harry Potter movies rolled into one (yes, I'm not exactly what you would call a fan of all things Rowling).It certainly helps that this film's younger cast members can actually act: Highmore and Bolger both give thoroughly convincing performances, with the former handling his difficult dual role with aplomb (whereas Daniel Radcliffe, as HP, has trouble with just the one role). It also doesn't hurt having a solid supporting cast who are there purely to do the job, rather than to turn up like star guests in a long-running TV series (am I the only one fed up with all of the familiar faces cropping up as staff at Hogwarts?).Loaded with great action sequences, stunning special effects (check out the amazing scene in which the children ride a griffin to a fairy kingdom), quite a few laughs, and even some scary scenes (but nothing that should cause nightmares), The Spiderwick Chronicles is a solid piece of family-friendly fantasy entertainment.7.5 out of 10, rounded up to 8 for IMDb.",The Spiderwick Chronicles
9,tavm,The Spiderwick Chronicles provides wonderful family entertainment,9,22 February 2008,"This was another movie I picked at random for me and my friend to see during our free time. It was playing at a theatre that he's supposed to start working at soon. This was an enchanting movie concerning goblins, fairies, and ogres as well as children affected by divorce and an old lady who misses her long-lost father. There's also some nice humorous touches concerning another creature named Thimbletack who only calms down by drinking lots of honey. He is voiced by Martin Short. Also in the cast are Nick Nolte who voices Mulgarath and appears as him in human form, David Strathaim as Arthur Spiderwick, Jordy Benattar as his young daughter-Lucy, Joan Plowright as the now much older Lucy, Mary-Louise Parker as the mother Helen Grace, Andrew McCarthy as her ex-husband Richard, and as her children, Sarah Bolger as Mallory, and Freddie Highmore as Simon and Jared Grace. I and my friend were pretty much captivated by everything that went on in this movie though initially I was a little irritated by how Mallory kept on harping on little brother Jared. Anyone with kids or is a kid at heart should also enjoy this wonderful production from Nickelodeon Studios. So on that note, I definitely recommend The Spiderwick Chronicles.",The Spiderwick Chronicles
10,poolandrews,"Childish fantasy film, a bit too juvenile for my liking.",3,19 February 2011,"The Spiderwick Chronicles starts as single mother Helen Grace (Mary-Louise Parker) & her two twin boys Simon & Jared (both played by Freddie Highmore) & her teenage daughter Mallory (Sarah Bolger) arrive at the old rundown country house left to her by her great-great grandfather Arthur Piderwick (David Strathairn) who mysteriously disappeared eighty years ago. As soon as the family move in strange things start to happen, objects start to go missing & Jared hears noises in the wall. Jared explores the house & finds a secret attic where he also finds a leather bound book written by Arthur Spiderwick with warnings not to open or read it but Jared does anyway. Titled 'Arthur Spiderwick's Field Guide to the Fantastical World Around You' the book is a collection of all known information compiled by Spiderwick about magical creatures like faeries, trolls & goblins that exist all around us but are invisible to humans. An evil Orge named Mulgarath wants the book in order learn it's secrets & take over the world...Directed by Mark Waters this childish fantasy film was obviously made on the back of other successful epic fantasy adventures based on books such as The Lord of the Rings, Harry Potter & The Chronicles of Narnia & for me wasn't anything special & as an adult didn't really appeal to me all that much. Thus far there has been five Spiderwick Chronicle books written by Holly Black & illustrated by Tony DiTerlizzi beginning with The Spiderwick Chronicles: The Field Guide (2003), to be honest before watching The Spiderwick Chronicles I had no idea it was based on a series of books & this simply failed to capture my imagination. The main human character's are dull, the kid with anger problems who seems to want to feel sorry for himself all the time & want everyone else to feel sorry for him get on my nerves, the mother has little screen time while the sister & brother are merely there to get into trouble & help out occasionally. The creatures are alright but the bad guy's are defeated a bit too easily (including one of the worst send offs for a main villain ever) while the friendly creatures are mostly played for (failed) laughs & I just found the whole affair rather bland going, at an hour & a half it moves along at a reasonable pace but it's pretty repetitive & it's a little bit too safe as the character's are never put in much peril & the evil monsters never seemed to pose much threat or menace. As well as a rather complicated fantasy based plot the script tries to raise a few social issues like how parent separation affects children, anger management issues & trust but it never made made much of a meaningful impact for me. I suppose The Spiderwick Chronicles might appeal to younger kids but the cuteness of it, the safeness & predictability of it made it a bit of a chore for me to sit through & there's a horribly sentimental happy ever after ending that I could have done without. Overall The Spiderwick Chronicles is alright if your under seven years old but maybe it's not one for the adults, like me.With a predictably big budget one would expect spectacular CGI effects work & while it's alright it never amazes, there's a huge flying Griffin which looks good & the Ogre Mulgarath in his true form at the end looks good too but otherwise all the creatures are quite cuddly & cute with maybe a line in toy's in mind. The CGI is alright but never outstanding, while watching The Spiderwick Chronicles I didn't have a clue that both Jared & Simon were played by the same actor which I presume meant the makers uses CGI & split screen techniques to have them both on the screen together.With a supposed budget of about $90,000,000 I am sure the studio was thinking about a possible series but I doubt there will be anymore, or at least anymore mega budget Hollywood productions. Filmed in Montréal in Québec in Canada, the production values are glossy & polished as one would expect. The acting is alright, nothing special but alright with Nick Nolte making a small cameo appearance.The Spiderwick Chronicles is a typical childish fantasy epic that didn't work for me, the effects are alright but not amazing & the plot failed to capture my imagination which was the real killer. Not terrible if your under ten but not very good either & any adults out there might want to just leave the kids to watch it on their own.",The Spiderwick Chronicles
11,Calicodreamin,Fantasy thriller with a good ending,6,22 September 2019,"The Spiderwick chronicles is a fun family friendly fantasy thriller of sorts. A family moves into an old home and discover a mysterious book about magical creatures. They soon realize these creatures are real and are forced to defend their home from goblins trying to steal the book. The cgi is pretty good and the monsters aren't too scary. The acting is good from the kids, Freddie highmore plays both twin brothers and does a fair job. Cute movie, storyline is simple, and the ending is wholesome.",The Spiderwick Chronicles
12,view_and_review,PG that wanted to be PG-13,5,25 October 2021,"A boy with anger management issues and a penchant for being reckless moved into a desolate old house in the middle of nowhere. It was one of the weirdest moves you'll ever see. Jared Grace (Freddie Highmore), twin brother Simon Grace (also Freddie Highmore), older sister Mallory Grace (Sarah Bolger), and mom Helen (Mary-Louise Parker) pulled up to the decrepit mansion at night with no belongings and walked right into the house and flipped a switch. In no time at all Jared discovered a mythical creature called a Brownie (voiced by Martin Short) and a secret book with all kinds of power that was never explained.This book, known as the Spiderwick Chronicles, was a chronicling of all of these mythical creatures and their strengths and weaknesses per the research of Arthur Spiderwick (David Strathairn). An ogre named Mulgarath (Nick Nolte) wanted the book so that he could take over the world (your standard megalomaniac stuff). As long as the book stayed within ""the circle"" (a circle of mushrooms around the house), then the book--therefore the world--was safe. If the book left the circle, which angry and reckless Jared made sure to do, then look out world.""Spiderwick"" was too dysfunctional for me and it looked like it was hastily thrown together. This was one of the many movies in which all problems are solved by peril. Once a family, a couple, friends, or whoever go through a perilous situation together everything is good once they survive it. It's an overly simplistic plot move that you find in too many movies. This PG movie that behaved like a PG-13 couldn't cut it as either.",The Spiderwick Chronicles
13,neil-476,Excellent family fare,8,8 May 2008,"A family moves into a creepy old house. Mum, teenage daughter, twin sons on the verge of teens. There are family tensions related to an absent Dad, and the two boys react differently: one is very passive, biddable, and avoids conflict, the other (Jared) is full of attitude and anger. Jared becomes aware of things moving within the wall: it turns out to be a brownie who is protecting a book, Arthur Spiderwick's Field Guide. Arthur Spiderwick is a great-uncle from years ago. The Field Guide turns out to be a guide to the invisible (unless they choose to be seen) magical creatures all around, and is a dangerous item: if the local ogre obtains it, he can (dare I say it) rule the world, bwa ha hah! Fortunately, there is a magical protective circle surrounding the house. Various chases, battles, strategems etc. ensue - think Home Alone, only goblins instead of Joe Pesci.I haven't read the books on which this film was based, so I'm looking at it on its own merits. The first thing to say is that Freddie Highmore (the boy from Finding Neverland), who plays both twins, with wholly convincing US accents, is, again, excellent. He makes both boys very different, and the rawness of emotion in Jared is quite plain. In fact, for all the fanciful and magical goings on, the heart of this film is the damaged relationships between the family members and how the events of the story lead to some sort of reconciliation.The story is fine - no huge surprises, but it proceeds quite satisfactorily. The effects are also very well done. The creatures (courtesy of the great Phil Tippett, the last major protagonist of stop-frame animation before CGI took over) are very reminiscent of Henson Creature Shop critters - this is a fairly kid-friendly film, although the ogre is scary for smaller kids, and there was one moment which saw me jump out of my chair (fortunately the movie was near the end of its run, and I was the only one in the auditorium!). There are a handful of genuinely emotional moments, too. Nick Nolte and Andrew McCarthy were in blink-and-you'll-miss-'em cameos, but David Strathairn and Joan Plowright put in good performances.This is an entertaining family film for all except the most sensitive children.",The Spiderwick Chronicles
14,evanston_dad,"Nothing New, But Enjoyable Enough",6,16 June 2008,"This film's not half bad, even if it does have a ""been there, done that"" quality to it in the wake of the recent glut of fantasy films based on children's books.Freddie Highmore is a good little actor, and he carries this movie about three children who unwittingly become involved in a battle to keep a book of magic secrets from falling into the hands of an evil goblin (played by Nick Nolte, because who else would play an evil goblin?) The movie never gives us a great deal of reason to care about anything going on, and the special effects are numerous and unimpressive, but I was moderately engaged anyway. It probably helps that I saw it on a flight from Hawaii to Chicago and had little else to do, but still....Grade: B",The Spiderwick Chronicles
15,anaconda-40658,The Scatter-Brain Chronicles.,2,4 May 2015,"The Spiderwick Chronicles (2008): Dir: Mark Waters / Cast: Freddie Highmore, Mary Louise Parker, Sarah Bolger, David Strathairn, Andrew McCarhty: This is one of the most idiotic big budget movies since Wild Wild West. The plot has all the excitement of burnt toast. A family moves into a big house where a magical book is discovered by a boy, played by Freddie Highmore. It was written by his great uncle and can unleash evil creatures. That sounds like a great thing to leave for one's family. Why not just leave them a very large check and save them the headache. Director Mark Waters does his best but he really should go back to what worked for him. Mean Girls worked as one of the best of teen flicks that its target audience can relate to. With Spiderwick Chronicles he revisits the stupidity of Head Over Heels and that is a major scale backwards. This film has a whole family of morons. When told not to take the book outside the house, Highmore does so not once, but twice. That's a prime example of a kid who uses no common sense. Mary Louise Parker has the thankless role of mother-who-doesn't-listen-to-kids-and-yells-a-lot role. Sarah Bolger is given the embarrassing role of sword fighter sister. Finally there is David Strathairn as the senile uncle who comes off as if he walked onto the wrong film set. Despite fine visual elements, this film should be destroyed alongside the book. Score: 2 / 10",The Spiderwick Chronicles
16,Aaron1375,Not a spider in sight...,6,11 March 2019,"I know, I know, Spiderwick is the name of the guy who wrote the book, but still, I was expecting a spider of some sort within this strange fantasy tale. Was not all bad, but I can also see why this went no further than the one movie as it is really nothing all that special. Just seems more like it should have been a pilot for a television movie rather than a feature length film, maybe even a Netflix series. Some things just are not as good when transcribed from book to film and that may be the case here too.The story has a mother and her children moving into a house because they cannot afford to live in New York anymore and as usual they somehow end up moving into what is essentially a mansion. Happens all the time in films and books and it is a bit of a tired trope. ""Children, we cannot afford to live in this two bedroom apartment, but as luck would have it, I have access to a mansion in the middle of nowhere that will cost vastly less to live in!"" Of course,there is one child who is not to keen about this, but then his brother is not exactly on his side, even though they are the same person! Then there is the sister who is annoying, but she knows fencing! cough foreshadowing cough cough. Well there is something in the house and it inadvertently leads to an upstairs secret room which houses a book that seems to have many secrets of mythical and wondrous creatures and opening seems to trigger things in motion leading to all sorts of nasty creatures looking for the book! The brother must find a way to protect the book and stop the creatures from taking the book, because there will be trouble if Mulgarath gets his hands on the book!Freddie Highmore plays duel roles in this one as both twin brothers. He is more known now as the doctor with autism in, The Good Doctor. The film also has Andrew McCarthy in a small role which is a shock cause I have not seen him in anything in years! Dude used to be in everything! Nick Nolte is also in this film; however, his voice is used way more than the actor himself, though he does appear briefly as a human in this one. All the cast do okay , but the film is so by the numbers that it is not really all that surprising.So, it was not a bad film, just a bit on the underwhelming side of things. Like I said, feels like a television pilot or something. For the most part, nearly all the action takes place around a house, but then we have this generic flying scene that does not look good to another bland locale. Just seems like this one should not have cost 90 million to make. It is not the worst movie though and has entertaining moments within, just not enough to be a really solid film.",The Spiderwick Chronicles
17,DICK STEEL,A Nutshell Review: The Spiderwick Chronicles,6,27 February 2008,"I guess movies based on children's fantasy books are money spinners that are just too hard to be passed up. But for each Harry Potter and Bridge to Terabithia, there's Eragon and The Golden Compass. The latter two have ready literary installments, but their dismal box office result means they are unlikely to be made anytime soon. Which is probably why The Spiderwick Chronicles decided to combine multiple books into a palatable 100 minute movie that just gets to the point without unnecessary meandering.Based on the books by Holly Black and Tony Diterlizzi, the story centers on three children, twins Jared and Simon Grace (a double dose of Freddie Highmore), and older sister Mallory Grace (Sarah Bolger), who chance upon a whole new world as introduced in a secret book written by Arthur Spiderwick (David Strathaim), albeit with a warning not to read it, lest they attract the attention of an evil ogre and its minions. Of course, being children, and the rebel amongst them - Jared, learns all that he can about the world of faeries and various miscellaneous thingamajigs that we don't get introduced to much at all. So it's a battle between the good children and the evil monsters as the latter try their best to steal Arthur's field guide, in order for world domination (as always)!On the whole, as a children's movie, it works to entertain the kids. There were rounds of applause each time the children go one up against the enemies, who aren't really that bright and are easily defeated by tomato sauce (yup, it's a children's movie alright). Some scenes reminded me of Home Alone though, where normal household items become weapon of choice against the enemies. There are the usual pathos built in with the usual parental- children break down in relationships, such as that between Jared and mom Helen (Mary- Louise Parker), and the waiting for promises fulfilled between Lucinda (Joan Plowright) and dad Arthur Spiderwick. I'd bet if the filmmakers can insert reminders to listen to your parents, they would.The special effects don't really set to wow, and the creature designs also don't set out to astonish. They come across as fairly routine effort in crafting realism, but somehow lacked a distinct soul. Perhaps it's the lack of focus given to individual creatures that they don't come across as unique, or very lazily and hastily slapped together since they're usually moved around in groups. Action set pieces are somewhat below par, and involves lots of running, little physical contact between combatants, and not much tension building where you would root for or cheer for the heroes. Then again, this is an adult watching the movie, not a child, who would have a different opinion.Fans of Freddie Highmore would be delighted that he does get to stretch his acting chops a bit, although it's just acting through 2 characters on different ends of the spectrum. Filled with various supporting voices like Martin Short as Thimbletack the brownie, Seth Rogen as Hogsqueal hobgoblin and Nick Nolte as evil shape-shifting ogre Mulgarath, it's pretty much a standard action adventure suitable for the entire family with little violence and no gore, though to adults, it might be a little bore.",The Spiderwick Chronicles
18,siderite,Slightly below average fairytale,6,20 July 2008,"I didn't expect much, but I got even less than that. The graphics are well done and the actors' play is decent, but the story itself makes no real sense. It's easy to lose sense when you are doing a children fantastic story, but it doesn't really make sense from a cinematic perspective either. What is the point in making a simple story if it has holes in it? What is the reason of bringing Nick Nolte for a few scenes? What is the reason to use a child in a double role of brothers when you could have easily hired twins? And so on and so on.It's not really bad. I mean, it has some scares for small children and maybe their imagination would blow the whole thing out of proportion anyway and make it a good film just because they automagically plug the holes and add details in the little heads, before they grow up into sour movie critics as myself, but still, this could have been a little more than just a ""make money from a children story"" project.Bottom line: watch it with small children, maybe 10 or 12 years old max. Anything above that would laugh at it and adults just don't get the necessary level of story quality to enjoy the film.",The Spiderwick Chronicles
19,Smells_Like_Cheese,A new children's classic for years to come,8,5 March 2008,"When I saw the trailer for The Spiderwick Chronicles, it looked a little scary for a children's movie, or at least for the family. But when I was working and I saw people leaving the theater, they were just excited and said it was scary, but it was a fun story. I finally saw The Spiderwick Chronicles on Sunday and I really liked it. I haven't read the novel, but to be honest because of this movie, I'm a little more interested, because this was a very fun fantasy story. But the movie itself was wonderful and the special effects were incredible, I couldn't believe how beautiful they made the creatures look. The story was charming and such a fun fairy tale that took me back to when I was a kid and just imagined myself in these stories, like Jumanaji or The Goonies, I think that's what The Spiderwick Chronicles will do for the new generation of children.Jared, Simon, and Mallory are moving into a new town and house with their divorced mom, Helen. Jared is having a hard time and wants to be back with his dad, but he gets distracted from these thoughts when he finds a book in the attic, a book written by his great great uncle, about the creatures he has found throughout the years, the relationship he also developed with them and how secretive it is. But a creature, an evil thing, Mulgarath, wishes to have the book and destroy all the creatures. Mulgarath will do anything to get this book, even sends his army of evil goblins to the protected house and Jared, Simon, and Mallory have to figure a way to protect the creatures.The Spiderwick Chronicles is a wonderful fairy tale that will charm it's way into your heart. Freddie Highmore is becoming quite the little actor, taking on two roles, opposite personalities, his talents are glowing in The Spiderwick Chronicles. Even though I'm still debating on how some things may not be totally suitable for children, I think it's still a great family film. The effects are magical and just beautiful, the story is very touching and I very much recommend this film, it's a good one.8/10",The Spiderwick Chronicles
20,Buddy-51,impressive visuals overcome bland storyline,6,7 June 2009,"In ""The Spiderwick Chronicles,"" based on the books by Tony DiTerlizzi and Holly Black, a mother and her three children move into a cobweb-infested ancestral home, only to find the property already occupied by an assortment of goblins, ogres, griffins, fairies and sprites that the children's great-great uncle, Arthur Spiderwick, discovered living there a century earlier.While the very youngest in the audience may be freaked out by the movie's intense action sequences and occasionally rather gruesome imagery, their older siblings will likely be drawn in by the darker tone and the self-aggrandizing nature of the kids-to-the-rescue scenario. Most adults, however, will probably find less than meets the eye in what is, essentially, a domesticated version of the ""Narnia"" movies. Still, what DOES meet the eye is often quite impressive, and the reassuring presence of such acting stalwarts as Nick Nolte, Joan Plowright and David Strathaim in minor roles goes a long way towards mitigating the rather mundane nature of the material.",The Spiderwick Chronicles
21,bensonmum2,Not quite the movie my son was hoping for,6,16 February 2008,"A family moves into the now empty house owned by an old, eccentric great aunt who has gone to live in a nearby sanitarium. While exploring the house, one of the boys finds a book that opens a world of magical creatures. Unfortunately for his family, though, an ogre named Mulgarath wants the book and the power it will give him. And he'll stop at nothing to get it.Let me say upfront that I've never read the books The Spiderwick Chronicles is based on. In fact, until recently, I had never even heard of The Spiderwick Chronicles. I say all this to show that I had no preconceived notions or expectations going into the movie. About the only thing I knew was that my 5 year-old son really wanted to go. Overall, while I enjoyed much of the movie, I did have a few problems that keep me from fully endorsing it.As for what worked, I'll start with the action. Much of the action in The Spiderwick Chronicles is the ""edge of the seat"" variety. The films finale with Mulgarath chasing the family around the house is exceptionally well done. In some of the other user comments I've written, I have slammed CG special effects. But here they are used marvelously. It's gotten so that it's difficult to tell where reality ends and the CG begins. The acting is another big highlight for me. Freddie Highmore, Mary-Louise Parker, and Sarah Bolger all give life and believability to their respective roles. Highmore, in particular, did an outstanding job of creating two distinct characters. Another bonus is that this is a family that actually looks like they could be related. It's a nice piece of casting.On to what didn't work. First, I'm not a big fan of the family dynamic presented in The Spiderwick Chronicles. When these people aren't being chased by monsters, they seem to spend their time yelling at each other. Why not have a family that gets along? I believe that at least part of the reason I felt this way is that the movie feels incredibly rushed. I've read that five books were crammed into this one movie. It shows. There seemed to be little time for any character interaction that didn't move the plot along or set-up a scene later in the movie. Finally, the movie was much more frightening than I had expected it to be. It didn't bother me, but it scared my son to death. He won't even talk about the parts that didn't scare him  and he's the reason we went. I'm no prude, but maybe this one should have been rated PG-13.In the end, the good nudges out the bad and I'll rate The Spiderwick Chronicles a 6/10.",The Spiderwick Chronicles
22,Robert_duder,Next to the barrage of Fantasy attempts Spiderwick climbs above them victoriously!!,9,27 February 2008,"I'm not sure what started it...Harry Potter perhaps or Lord of The Rings but somehow the fantasy/sci-fi genre became a marketable spot to be in. Since those two successful film trilogies we've been literally barraged with copy cats, or attempts to cash in and for the most part they have seriously missed their mark. The Spiderwick Chronicles truly impressed me. I think they took a huge point from Harry Potter in the way that they made a fantasy genre film for the 'tween' demographic that doesn't hold back. It's not a cushy feel good, cutesy little movie and actually has thrills and scares, and some intense moments that the demographic can actually enjoy and also adults too. It is definitely too intense for the young movie goers but that's okay too because the 'tween' and up demographic is enormous!! I have never read the books, and honestly had never really heard of the books before the film but I do like the fantasy genre and was truly blown away by the performances, the special effects which didn't reek of CGI and the story. It's a simple plot but enthralling enough to get you drawn into it. Some of the monsters and the characters are truly brilliant. I think the only thing that was a down side to the film is that there wasn't more of it. I thought it could have been a little more epic feeling but what they created was brilliant enough.I am a huge Freddie Highmore fan. He blew me away years ago in Finding Neverland and I have always watched him closely because he does some really incredible things and this is no exception. Highmore plays not only the main character Jared Grace, a precocious, troubled, young boy who discovers the fantasy world outside his home but he also plays a supporting role as Jared's twin brother Simon who is a withdrawn, quiet, avoiding boy. They are legitimately different characters and one is far more outgoing than the other and Highmore's performance reflects two different characters and that is impressive!! Highmore has acting chops beyond his years. Lovely Sarah Bolger, plays the older sister Mallory. She is feisty, and a powerful force on screen. Her sword fight scene when she first discovers the evil monsters is awesome. Her and Highmore have great chemistry and even now I think of them as a cast of three but it was only the two of them. The two of them make a great duo. Mary-Louise Parker plays the kids' mother Helen. She doesn't have a huge role but she plays her part well as the doubting mother, stressed about divorce and moving away and a new job. She's not the focus and yet has an important role. David Strathairn is also terrific as Arthur Spiderwick, the man who first discovered this world. Strathairn is an amazing character actor and his presence is really great in the film. Also a very important part of this cast is the varied voices for the different monsters and they really bring out a terrific personality in them all. Nick Nolte is growling and menacing as the evil Mulgarath, Martin Short is as always amazing and a terrificly unique voice as Thimbletack, and the very funny Seth Rogen as the terrific character but used far too little...Hogsqueal.And that is the key to The Spiderwick Chronicles. I beg for sequels and serialization because there is just so much that they left untapped. It felt like they tried to get some really interesting characters into the story but just didn't have enough time to develop the really interesting characters. Spiderwick doesn't take you to another world or planet...all this happens right in their backyard but it still manages to be this amazing adventure and they do go beyond their backyard to travel time and space. It's a breathtaking, thrilling adventure fantasy that I hope is just a small step in serializing it and bringing the characters back for another adventure. I whole heartedly think that the 'tween' demographic will love it and best of all adults, parents and so forth can enjoy every minute as well. Truly a very well done film for this genre. Mark Waters, who is kind of a bit of a new director to the scene but he has done some truly great movies...not Academy Award artsy movies but fun and genre appropriate and just really great to watch. Any fan of this type of film or want something exciting for your family will love The Spiderwick Chronicles. 9/10",The Spiderwick Chronicles
23,g-bodyl,Good Family Fare!,8,6 December 2010,"The Spiderwick Chronicles is the perfect family film but I think children will like this better. I read some reviews and someone liked this movie but gave it a one because it has a few violent scenes. Well if you read the book, you should have known the basics of the movie. I thought it was pretty good for kids on par with the first Harry Potter film.This about a single mom and her three kids who move into a mysterious house. Little did they know, creatures of mystical beings lives in the area. But these creatures namely the goblins want the field guide so they can rule the world. Now the kids have to make sure no harm comes to the book.The acting is pretty good. I liked Freddie Highmore and I think he did even better than Charlie and the Chocolate Factory.Overall, this is a decent family/fantasy movie. I think kids will enjoy it. I rate this film 8/10.",The Spiderwick Chronicles

It's kind of sad this movie didn't do better at the box office.",The Spiderwick Chronicles
25,briancham1994,Decent childhood adventure,7,10 August 2020,This film is a good if imperfect fantasy adventure film for children. It follows three child characters who accidentally unlock the world of supernatural creatures and have to fight them off. It's a fun story but nothing special. I personally prefer Bridge to Terabithia (2007).,The Spiderwick Chronicles
26,johnnyboyz,"Worthy of a go, certainly more-so than most others of the film's ilk - you may even come away having enjoyed it.",6,15 April 2013,"The Spiderwick Chronicles is the film for kids who weren't quite old enough to see Pan's Labyrinth and are far too young to be able to remember Jumanji. To say that it falls in between the two films in terms of overall grade is not saying much, as many films done such a thing, but while this doesn't have the mature, sweeping majesty of del Toro's master work, it actually dares to be a bit more than the somewhat episodic demonstration of spooky special effects and meek character arcs that made up Joe Johnston's 1995 action/horror concept movie. In short, the film is actually rather enjoyable and I was surprised as to how it eventually congealed into this pretty decent adventure piece about magical worlds and differing, fictional creatures with their own set of characteristics and agendas all coming to interact with one another and our own world. There is a fun giddiness to proceedings, and while it doesn't quite crack the emotional marks of great magnitude for which it aims, there is a decent, solid adventure film in there with a genuine sense of terror and danger apparent.The film is about three child siblings who become mixed up in a plot to take over the world, a plot instigated by small, evil little creatures who're led by one rather large evil creature. This character is the film's strong antagonist, a shape-shifting ogre named Mulgarath, played by Nick Nolte – Nolte appears to be channeling David Bowie from 1986's ""Labyrinth"", although the beast itself looks a little too much like a de-masked Predator to be anything truly original or frightening. The children are Mallory, Simon and Jared Grace -with Sarah Bolger playing the eldest in Mallory and Freddie Highmore doubling up in playing both of her younger brothers. The deadly, threatening means by which these creatures think they're going to do this, however, is through that of......a book, and it is inside of their new home that this book is located. Their new home is actually a rather old one, one of those large; spooky looking houses from centuries ago which comes complete with a lone, circular window on its top storey. Around it lies woodland, and there is nary another soul for miles. Preceding this family of four moving in (not forgetting their mother, Helen!) was an odd scientist whose interests and experiments on animals and insects eighty years ago doubled up as the early findings on all that'll follow.So far, so Jumanji: the fatherless family unit with a young son, who does not speak; of whom are at logger-heads with one another in a social sense, thus need a lesson in teamwork, but of whom are then traversed off onto a scary adventure wherein they find an item in the attic (not a board game this time, a book) that carries with it the ability to induce the sort of horrors and impending doom only a special effects house could. It is some general messing around on a generally slow day that brings about the evils of this Macguffin, namely: invisible goblins who, in spite of their ability, mostly decide to hide in the long grass anyway. They are invisible, of course, so that the grown-ups won't be able to see them, while the film tries to eke out as much tension as possible from the initial exchanges by having the one sibling no one will believe/entrust, in Jared, initially stumble upon it. Poor Jared tries to tell his older sister about the threat of the impending doom and how he's started to see mythical creatures who have appeared from nowhere and started talking to him. Needless to say, it won't wash and it reminds us of the positive writings on a Japanese animation from the 1980s entitled ""My Neighbour Totoro"", when that particular film was praised for its subversion of such a limp tactic: its own infant characters found magical beasts only to rush and tell their parent, who actually believed them anyway and the film played out from there.When everyone is eventually in on it, the film gets some energy going and actually breaks out into a fairly involving; fairly gripping chase/adventure piece which has them dart all around the local town on top of a couple of other places few have ever before treaded. There is an amusing stop to the local psychiatric hospital, where their great aunt Lucinda (Plowright) is housed out of her stumbling upon similar plots and creatures when she was a kid. Back then, there wasn't anyone around to believe her, thus she ended up where she is but the whole episode reminded me of what befell Sarah Connor in the second Terminator film: a desperate attempt to inform everyone of a shocking reality, but no one around to actually chip in. Thus, it's off to the cells. One can only guess what her equivalent to the line: ""Anybody not wearing two million sun-block is going to have a really bad day, get it!?"" was when trying to get across to her doctors that the end is nigh.There's enough in The Spiderwick Chronicles to like; this alternate idea that magical worlds full of unreal things are dangerous and could cost you your life as opposed to being these fun, fluffy places wherein you'd quite like to lose yourself (alá the early Harry Potter films, et al.) is refreshing. Its core themes of team work and trust are as apparent here as they are in the Narnia films or anywhere else, while its imagery towards the end of the strong family unit working together as one blooded component to defend one's home is striking in a world of gay adoption and such. In spite of its lack of originality, the film is exciting and fleetingly quite frightening – a film those of a younger disposition will no doubt enjoy more than others, but that's not to say it is impossible to enjoy whatever your age.",The Spiderwick Chronicles
27,leplatypus,A silly rural sort of fantasy « gremlins » (tv),1,27 May 2016,"In the XXIth, it's no more a surprise to see a exploded family : this one is without a father and i suppose i should go along. Then, we go into a country manor lost in the woods and that is rather unexpected. This old house is rather well done as it reminds me of my parents' one due to its antic furniture's ! Next, the supernatural comes in and for a time, it's rather interesting : we have got a sort of a tiny mouse turning green and bad like the Hulk and above all rural, forest entities (ogre, goblin) ! It's a bit like we have Tolkien's fantasy coming into our actual modern love but then it's the point when the movie turns really bad ! First, i know that those creatures are evil but it's hard to see teens acting like soldiers and one more time killing the bad guys ! Maybe i'm wrong but in my childhood, teens were more intelligent and peaceful when confronted and never used killing as a way to escape ! Next, we goes into a sort of faerie land to know about the fate of the ancestor : having this character back in the movie is really bad as we have a granny crying for her much younger father ! One more time, we have a single parent family and more time the child is tied in Oedipus stage as this only parents mean so much ! At last, we have the big finale which is the usual big fight, big violent moment and the movie falls down even lower with the scene of the boy stabbing his « father » ! It's like the remake of Snow White in which she stabbed the Evil Queen ! I found this scene totally inappropriate and really damaging for children education ! With the crazy world we live actually, i don't think it's sane to entertain our children with movies that praises violence, that depict themselves spilling blood and killing parental images ! So, at the end, this movie really stenches as we are left only with brave little soldiers, happy to kill the bad ones and living alone blissfully with one single parent !",The Spiderwick Chronicles

29,FiendishDramaturgy,Fantastic,9,19 February 2008,"NOTE: I only clicked the ""spoiler warning"" because I mention things which were featured prominently in the books, but were NOT in the film version. I in no way give away the story to anyone who has never read the books. Thank you. Unlike most movies of this type, there is no comic relief. Jared (the starring character) has serious anger issues (he hits things whenever he is mad, yells at his mother, and acts out in general) over a father who has left and a mother who refuses to explain anything. While the Faeries and Faerie-kind do serve to lighten the mood, there is nothing comic or comedic or even child-like about them.This work has lessons to teach, concerning when it's time to accept a situation with grace and work positively towards a satisfactory change. But the more superficial lessons are to listen to your children, give true time and attention to those in your life and the world around you, and time is NOT on your side.There have been lots of gentle cautionings to parents of younger children of the fear factor of this work and there ARE some startling scenes, but my caution would be more geared towards younger children's inability to understand Jared's anger issues and his behaviors as inappropriate, due to the movie's failure to address these issues.The CGI was wonderful, but after the Lord of the Rings and the Chronicles of Narnia, it almost requires something as creative as Pan's Labyrinth to impress me, but I am (admittedly) a graphics (visuals) addict.Freddie Highmore turns in a stellar performance as Jared Grace, while his interpretation of Simon suffers to give Jared's character adequate development and screen time. Also painted as sacrificial lambs were Mallory's fencing competition, a plethora of other events and details, and the WHOLE FOURTH BOOK! I thought the rewriting of the troll as a ""mole troll"" was a horrible contrivance; the mother isn't kidnapped; there is no junkyard (ergo: no Dragons); no elves; no inclusion of Simon's love for animals, his having loads of pets, etc.; and NO Dwarfs! No Poohka, no riddles, no Jared searching for the book, and NONE Of the intrigues, whatsoever! And the whole bit about Byron (the griffin) was totally rewritten. But... what you DO get is a brilliant adaptation, which will be wholly loved by ANYone who has missed the books...A brilliant adaptation most book fans will no doubt find as incomplete as any Harry Potter movie. But wonderful, nonetheless.Mulgarath is darkly wonderful, as are his Goblins. Hogsqueal is done particularly well. I personally especially loved his nose; it gave him a 'cuteness' factor he otherwise would have lacked (trust me here).The performances are professional but I was (again) particularly impressed with Highmore. Sarah Bolger contributed an adequate performance, as did Mary-Louise Parker, but it was Highmore who rightly stars herein. Also, I would be remiss if I failed to mention BBC Diva, Joan Plowright. Wow, what a lady! All in all? For all my complaints about what was omitted, I have to say I liked the screen adaptation even better than the accumulated story from the five sequential books! Especially the ending. The ending was beautiful and it is probably what strayed most from the literary version. I loved it, but won't spoil it.It rates an 8.7/10 from...the Fiend :.",The Spiderwick Chronicles
30,freemantle_uk,An enjoyable family fantasy,7,10 July 2011,"Since Lord of the Rings and Harry Potter have reinvented the fantasy film genre producers in Hollywood have been desperate to repeat that success. Producers have looked for children's books to adapt into films and hope to have a series. The Spiderwick Chronicles is a better attempt and a perfectly enjoyable family film.The Grace Family, mum Helen (the always lovely Mary Louise Parker), daughter Mallory (Sarah Bolger) and twins Jared and Simon (both played by Freddie Highmore) move from New York to a country house they inherited. Jaden is particularly hostile to the move and clashes with his family. But Jared soon finds a book written by his great great uncle, Arthur Spiderwick (David Strathaim) that is about the mystical creatures that we can not see. But the powerful ogre Mulgrarath (Nick Nolte) wants the book for himself to make him unstoppable. Soon the children have to work together to stop him.Mark Waters is know for making family friendly films and he certainly makes a fast paced little adventure with quite a bit of action and small doses of comedy. The Spiderwick Chronicles speeds along nicely, not allowing things to drag and there is a some good CGI for the fantasy creatures. They is a light hearted tone to the film, making it enjoyable for children of all ages, I am such children would enjoy it like I enjoyed Jumanji when I was a child.There is strong chemistry between Highmore and Bolger. You can believe that they are brother and sister, fighting, arguing and putting each other down. It was also a tough role by Highmore because he had to play two very different characters, though Jaden was the more major character. As well as being a fantasy film there is also a family drama behind all the action as the family learn to trust Jaden and come to terms with their new move.There are some elements we have all seem before such as the kids moving to a new town and having trouble within their family situation.

31,dfranzen70,Are you under five? Do you automatically think goblins are awesome?,5,7 July 2008,"You know you're in for a treat when a main character defiantly says, ""We must protect the house!"" and then the next thirty minutes are spent beating the holy crap out of the house.The Spiderwick Chronicles, based on a series of children's fantasy books, will never be confused with its cleverer brethren, like the Harry Potter or Golden Compass books and movies. The movie is likable enough, with two appealing performances by Freddie Highmore (playing twins of different dispositions, of course), but it's steadfastly stupid in some parts and offers only stereotypically cardboard characterizations.The Grace family - mom, older sister, twin brothers - have relocated from New York to the rural Spiderwick estate. Mom's separating from dad, and not everyone in the family's taking it too well - Jared, the troublemaking teen, is sullen, disinterested, and angry. So right from the get-go we get plenty of interfamily dynamics that we'd just as soon do without - mom yelling at kids, sister Mallory smacking Jared around, bookish-twin Simon meekly accepting his role as doormat, that sort of thing. Everyone's sort of obnoxious. Which is kind of what you expect from a book about British kids, like the Narnia movies.At any rate, the defiant Jared stumbles upon a book written by his great-grandfather Arthur Spiderwick, a book that details the amazing - and dangerous - world right under their collective noses, surrounding the creepy and mysterious Victorian mansion they've moved into (Spiderwick's house). All of the secrets of these hidden worlds are contained in this book, it turns out, which begs the question of why it was written, since much of the movie involves people trying to get it and rule the world, or something.When Jaren shows his find to his family, naturally no one believes him, not even his twin brother. This is because in movies, the Bad Kid must never be believed about anything, and everything is immediately his fault, no matter how outlandish. Merely opening the book causes bad things to happen in the Grace house, including the sudden growth of Mallory's hair, which ties itself to her bedpost. Yep, gotta be her brother's fault.And as in many other movies, first no one believes Jared, then one, then two, then Mom herself - but only when evidence is staring them in the face. The lesson here, to the little kids watching the movie, is that one should be careful what one says to one's elders, because no one's gonna believe you. Cute, huh? Turns out that Spiderwick was borne away by sylphs (fairies), and his little daughter Lucy pined away for years awaiting his return - only to be committed to a sanitarium. Oh, but she left a legacy in the house, which is stocked with lots of salt, tomato sauce, and honey, all to help and combat these fantastical creatures. There's even a wide circle around the house that protects it and its inhabitants from danger.Which of course brings me to a particularly dumb aspect of the story, one that I can mention here. Inevitably, those creatures that desire the book launch an attack on the house. Jared and his family know the attack's coming, and they prepare. But no one thinks of expanding the circle! Geez, they have hours to figure this stuff out, and if they took all that salt they have in the house and widened the circle, they would have bought plenty of time. Man, given enough time, they could have put the circle around the goblins' lair! This is a rare fantasy story that pays barely any attention to its own mythological elements, which are really the bread and butter of any fantasy tale. Instead the focus is more on the family dynamic, and how no one believes anyone. And plus, cmon - the older sister just happens to be a world-class fencer? In one scene, she practices with good-twin Simon - and you'll note that neither of them are wearing any padding or equipment, and the sword is sharp, not blunt. I'm no fencing expert, but I'm pretty sure that's not how it's supposed to work, especially if you're a teenager.I can appreciate how the mom (Mary-Louise Parker) is trying hard to keep her kids together after having left her husband - and Jared doesn't make it easy for her - but she's so prone to jump to conclusions that my sympathy for her quickly dissipated.And lucky Freddie Highmore! You know you've hit it big when you get to play twins. And in keeping with tradition, the twins are nothing alike. He follows in the footsteps of the legendary Jean-Claude Van Damme here, as well as most soap-opera stars. Although it's a movie that seems like it should be about the Grace kids, Jared is front and center, as timid Simon is shunted aside almost entirely.The Spiderwick Chronicles is probably best for those less-discerning single-digit munchkins; anyone over six will be bored, and there aren't enough jokes to sustain anyone else's interest.",The Spiderwick Chronicles

A real disappointment, in my opinion, because they focused on the kids in terror aspect instead of allowing us to understand the fantasy world a little bit better instead of jolting us for 90 minutes. The basic storyline revolves around a troubled family that movie into an old house and find a book that is(guess what) not supposed to be opened!! And, of course, one of the Freddie Highmore characters( he plays a dual role of American speaking twins) opens it and all hell breaks loose in the fantasy world. The book was written by a man named Spiderwick 80 years earlier and tells of the unseen world and all of it's secrets. An evil character wants the book and a protective character, voiced by Martin Short, tries to explain the scenario to the child. The rest of the movie, the kids are pursued by the evil forces and their goal is to not be killed by it and kill it, of course. Sounds like a horror movie, doesn't it?? Anyway, the last 15 minutes are good but getting there is not fun. This movie was based on a series of books but I find it hard to believe that the series boiled down to this action piece. In my opinion, this was Hollywood's attempt to make it marketable and it doesn't work.

That house belongs to Arthur Spiderwick, Lucinda's father, and soon the children will discover the secrets of a fantasy world that is in danger.I like the story with this three children founding a fantasy world that shouldn't be founded and suddenly these children put in danger the entire fantasy world and their own lives. But the film goes very fast and the great moments in the story aren't memorable just as the solution of the problem. For example, the relation between Spiderwick and her daughter could be more memorable because he hasn't see her since she has 6 years old and now she has around 80 years old. Anyway, the visual part is great and the cast is decent.Conclusion: I like this film but I think I wouldn't watch it again. Is a great entertainment but just that so if you want to spend some time with your children this vacations, take them to the cinema to watch this film. Anyway there aren't many others. 7 out of 10",The Spiderwick Chronicles
38,Easygoer10,"Not Great, But Quite Good",7,11 October 2019,"It's odd that IMDB lists this as ""Action, Adventure, Drama""; however, not ""Fantasy"", which is exactly what it is. Freddie Highmore and Sarah Bolger are brilliant. Freddie Highmore needs no introduction, however Sarah Bolger was excellent in Jim Sheridan's film, ""In America"" (2002). This is quite good, however, even for adults.",The Spiderwick Chronicles
39,Easygoer10,Quite Good,7,16 November 2019,"(November 16, 2019) This is a very good film. As I typically avoid films with ""talking animals or creatures"", I found this by accident one day on regular broadcast TV. The primary reason I liked it was the presence of Freddy Highmore and Sarah Bolger. Both are extremely talented actors; especially Mr. Highmore. It's hard to believe they are just shy of 27 and 29 years old (respectively) today. So I do recommend it it to the right audience, which is a pretty vraod range of people. If you have a couple of hours, it's quite an interesting film. *Please note: In 1967, my older sister took me to see ""Wait Until Dark"". I was 13 years old. For the era, it was as tense and frightening as films got, in those days. Especially the climax near the end. All audiences reacted the same: They screamed in unison.",The Spiderwick Chronicles
40,pc95,Decent Fantasy w/ good Visuals;minor problems,6,5 April 2008,"Spiderwick Chronicles works pretty well as a fantasy with some interesting story elements. David Stratham in limited screen-time as Mr. Spiderwick excels. The movie sets up the villains early on to it's credit even if they are standardized including the main Ogre/Morgarat. Undoubtedly there will be Harry Potter comparisons/judgments of it as a ripoff. And yes some creatures (especially the griffin) are lifted....but scenes with it were done pretty well. (SPOILER) Actually probably the best scene/visuals in the movie included the kid-heroes landing with the Griffin in fairy-land including some interesting dialog and even a hint of science fiction in time passage. This particular scene/sequence helped bolster the interest level for me. However some of the side creatures like the honey-hoarding gnomish/imp became overused and irritating. A couple other things - almost 80% of the dialog is carried out through yelling, and there was absolutely no need to have twins - or in this case the same actor playing twins. It was distractingly bad - a different actor would've easily solved this. Anyway overall a pretty good fantasy - it hit it's own mark, though maybe didn't exceed it.",The Spiderwick Chronicles

I think this theory is right. I was disappointed by Harry Potter 5 at first, but watching it now for a year later and nearly forgetting about the book, I found it the best in the series.The same might as well go with this film. I was disappointed. If you don't know, this film is based on 5 books. However, the movie ignores the 4th book, which is probably because of budget issues and/or limited running time. Still, I can't help but complain. There could've been more creative production designs to see, more action, and more magical creatures.Apart from that, I felt that the film was well put together, especially the fact that they skipped a lot in the books. The special effects are very good, as well as the action scenes. I also may feel this film pushed the PG rating. It certainly is not as intense as Harry Potter 3 but there might be about 2 to 3 scenes that could make this film a PG-13 rating.The performances here are decent, although not captivating. The film may be a bit fast paced, if you asked me. Overall, this is a decent adaption to another fantasy book. If you have read the books, you might be disappointed.

It's pretty far away from there. I had high expectations for The Spiderwick Chronicles. It was an okay film, but far from Harry Potter. The problems I had with the film... Problem #1: The film took out many things from the book... I don't think they even mentioned anything from book 4. a series of Unfortunate events was based on three books and happened to mention everything it needed to mention. His sister wasn't even kidnapped or their house wasn't wrecked. They also changed the ending, might I add. The Spiderwick Chronicles had a huge cast also. Seth Rogen as Hogsqeal. Mary Louis Parker as The Grace family's mother. Martin Short was in it and so was Nick Nolte. How dare I forget Freddie Highmore, who has been acting for years now. DEspite it's cast, THe Spiderwick Chronicles still falls flat.I give it a mild recommendation, though it's not the best of fantasy films.",The Spiderwick Chronicles

Aunt Lucinda, daddy's sister has been taken to a booby hatch because she sees fairy's so the house appears abandoned. Surprise! There is a brownie (Thimbletack) living in the house. He is there to protect a book written by Arthur Spiderwick before he disappeared many years ago. In this book Spiderwick has identified the unseen world. This book is sought by the king nasty fey Mulgarath. Nick Nolte has what is basically a cameo playing Mulgarath as an old man (he does the voice as well). He looks almost as bad here as in his mug shots. The CGI in this film is some of the best I have seen. When Thimbletack gets angry he transforms into another creature, the transformation is done seamlessly to my eye. He is brought back when given honey. The other excellent transformations are when Mulgarath shape shifts at different points in the movie. The fight scene between the sister and the unseen goblins is so well done. One of the twin brothers can see them using a special ring and calls out their positions to his sister using clock times. I can recommend this movie for the entire family it is just well done, funny, and serious.",The Spiderwick Chronicles
48,fwomp,Here's Spit In Your Eye!,8,29 July 2008,"Visually appealing even if the story deviated significantly from the novels, THE SPIDERWICK CHRONICLES is bound to entertain young and old alike (but perhaps more the old).Starting with the visuals, Tippet Studios and ILM worked exceptionally well together to put out some very vivid visual effects. The creature creations were both interesting and sometimes creepy and since this was a large part of what we see as the audience, I found that I was pretty well glued to my TV screen as I watched the DVD.Although the kids in the film are much older than the kids in the books, I found this change acceptable and not irritating like some Spiderwick purists (and I think it's okay to be a purist as long as you look at the film as a whole and not in snippets).The story is that of the Grace family and their inheritance of an old mansion belonging to a (supposedly) deceased family member, Arthur Spiderwick (David Strathairn, GOOD NIGHT, AND GOOD LUCK). Strange things abound inside and outside this seemingly ancient place. But Helen Grace (Mary-Louise Parker, WEEDS) isn't interested so much in the place as she is getting away from her husband who's run off and left her with their three children. Mallory (Sarah Bolger) is the eldest and is the only daughter. Jared and Simon (Freddie Highmore, THE GOLDEN COMPASS) are twin boys but couldn't be more different. Simon is a self-proclaimed pacifist, while Jared is the belligerent and self absorbed one who finds the new home initially appalling and can't wait to be picked up by his father.The house eventually reveals its secretive past: a place where Arthur Spiderwick discovered we humans are not alone in the world. Beautiful and sometimes terrible things lurk in our periphery  and sometimes they are combined. This combination is quickly revealed when Jared finds a special reference book written by Mr. Spiderwick that explains each creature that hides in this peripheral land. With the book comes great danger. Knowledge of them is the primary problem, unless these special creatures want you to see them. And such is the case with Thimbletack (voiced by Martin Short) who initially is supposed to protect this book from prying eyes but fails to keep it out of Jared's hands. Thimbletack can also change from a caring creature to one of great disrespect and upset when things don't go the way he plans (note: keep honey nearby to reverse this process). But Thimbletack isn't the problem; it's Mulgarath (Nick Nolte, PEACEFUL WARRIOR), an ogre that desires the book and its secrets so that it can rule everyone and everything. And with him are his goblins and beasts that are tenacious in their pursuit of the book.But can three kids convince their mother that this newfound world is real? And dangerous? Looking through rounded stones and getting ""spit in your eye"" helps to see them, but what of Mulgarath, the shape-shifting ogre that learns many secrets when pages from the Chronicles are ripped out and passed on to him? The Grace's new house becomes the battleground, and the kids realize they need help and information. So they head out to see their great Aunt Lucinda (Joan Plowright, MRS. PALFREY AND THE CLAREMONT) who has been confined to a looney bin ever since she revealed to those around her that her father (Arthur Spiderwick) had been abducted by some of the creatures in this nearly invisible realm. Geared up with new and important ideas on how to fight Mulgarath and his legions, the Grace kids race back home and prepare for battle (which includes salt and tomatoes ...are we making pasta here?). But can the kids win against overwhelming odds? Of course they can ...with a little help from unknown quarters (gryphons, old men who aren't old, and Hogsqueal, a bizarre being with an infatuation for birds).Most important to this story is that it is a modern one. It isn't ancient history or trying to be old-English style. There are cell phones and new cars and plenty of modern items that let the audience know when and where they are.The acting is okay, but Joan Plowright shines as the superstar even though she's not given much screen time. I'm pretty fond of Freddie Highmore and his performances in AUGUST RUSH and CHARLIE AND THE CHOCOLATE FACTORY, but here he was just ""okay."" The big winners in every sense, though, were the special effects and the scenery. It really pulled the viewer in and made you believe in the things you were seeing; no small task nowadays.I would warn parents, though, that the PG rating is very well deserved. The violence is ever-present, as are the stabbings of small, evil creatures. It could also be a bit unnerving for kids to see a young boy being dragged off into the wilds by initially invisible creatures. Just a warning for those with real young ones.Besides that, this is a very good film. Something to watch for on Blu-Ray disc since the visuals are so stunning.",The Spiderwick Chronicles
49,cultfilmfan,The Spiderwick Chronicles,8,16 February 2008,"The Spiderwick Chronicles is based upon the books of the same name by Tony DeTerlizzi and Holly Black. The film centers around a mother and her three children who move into a mysterious and creepy new house pretty much in the middle of nowhere. The one son Jared who is the main character in the film, finds a book written by the previous owner of the house and Jared soon discovers that this is a magical yet very dangerous book that a lot of goblins and little creatures are after, but with the help of his twin brother, his older sister and some friendly creatures he gets the book to safety and also protects himself and his family from the evil monsters that want the book to do harm. Ever since The Lord Of The Rings and Harry Potter films have done so well, filmmakers are taking other fantasy books and turning them into feature films as well. The majority of them that have been released over the past few years I have not seen because for one thing they did not look appealing to me at all and also because of bad word of mouth and reviews. I wasn't sure what I would think of The Spiderwick Chronicles, but to my surprise I thought it was pretty good. The film is aimed at a family audience even though some young children might be afraid of some scenes, but this is a film that I think kids will absolutely love and there is enough here for the grownups as well. The story sounds simple enough, but it is enhanced by a lot of creative creatures and imaginative things going on. The young cast each did their own and carried the film and even though I don't usually like computer generated effects in films, I didn't feel it was overdone here just for the sake of showing what today's new wonderful technology can do and I really appreciated that the film didn't go overboard with that. The running time moves along fairly briskly and the film is involving and interesting from the start and keeps it's energy and charm throughout the running time. There were a few repeated story patterns and clichés in the script, but there were also a lot of surprises and new takes on things, so that can be forgiven. When looking at a film like this at a child you would like the magic, imagination and the story that is woven in front of you with interesting characters, environments and a grand sense of storytelling that can make the make believe into a fun and entertaining film. This is all captured very well here and works as a fairy tale for kids 8 to whatever age. A creative enough story helped by good film-making and an eye for what kids and adults love about these movies make this film a generally good and above average family fantasy film of the past few years.",The Spiderwick Chronicles

This film is a good a fantasy adventure in the tradition of Harry Potter and Bridge to Terabitha; I also I have a nack for fairies.For a child, moving isn't easy, especially when his (or her) parents had got a divorce. This happen to young Jared Grace. His father Richard had left his wife (and Jared's mom), Helen. Financially broke, Helen moves him, his twin brother Simon and his big sister Mallory to a New England home owned by a senile aunt, Lucinda Spiderwick. Lucinda has been institutionalized because she claimed that her father's disappearance was caused by Sylphs (wind fairies). As the children adapt to their new world, Mallory accuses Jared of stealing her fencing medal. Then, there are strange creaks heard from the house walls. One night, Jared finds a secret dumbwaiter and discovers a book with a warning that says; ""DO NOT READ THIS BOOK."" Of course, Jared reads the book and is introduced to a hidden world dominated by trolls, goblins and their leader an evil ogre named Mulgarath. As the family outcast, Jared finds allies with the brownie, Thimbletack and frees the hobgoblin Hogsqueal from a fate worst than death. In the end, Jared's new found friends help defeat Mulgarath's evil intentions. Jared also finds Arthur Spiderwick and reunites the father and the daughter.Admittedly, I don't have a favorite scene because I love the whole film. And I did feel sorry for Jared in the beginning (being a black sheep in the family), until the ending of the movie. He learns about children who have to live without their fathers and also the importance of family, which is an age-old lesson I don't mind at all.",The Spiderwick Chronicles

Freddie Highmore stars in the main role (Charlie from Charlie and the Chocolate factory), most of the cast is relatively unknown but that doesn't matter as the acting isn't bad.The plot's really good, very creative. Jared finds and reads a mysterious book filled with drawings and information on these goblins and fairy type creatures. Apparently he also unwittingly releases these monsters (or makes them aware of the book or something, regardless the goblins try to hunt him down) to disastrous consequences.Freddie Highmore skilfully plays both Jared and Simon in a dual role, which I found very clever as they're completely different people. Special effects are quite well done, maybe a bit overused but it would be difficult to have practical effects in place of goblins without costing a lot.7/10: An enjoyable romp, it isn't a masterpiece but it has a quality story and is never really boring.

It was colourful, well acted, and interesting. Again, though, I point out that I wanted escapist diversion! In terms of heavy philosophical critiquing, which may not even be fair here, this movie was a bit more meaningful than ""Harry Potter,' which although I know millions loved it, it didn't really mean anything. There were no archetypal human dynamics. Nothing ""spoke"" to us on the level of our Spirit or our inner Self. ""Spiederwick Chronicles"" had more than that; it did mean something. But it was not quite up to the superb and masterfully meaningful level of some films that appeal to kids and their parents (even the classic ""Dumbo"" had more meaning, in a funny way, as did the ""Shrek"" movies).

It was a fast pace action movie for kids that adult would also enjoy, though might be too scary in some part for young children.Synopsis: Jared a curious boy stumble upon a secret field guide that been kept hidden for 80 years from the faries, goblin and other creatures that live among us. A field guild that could destroy the whole world if fall into the wrong hand.This movie was quite alright, it was very extremely fast pace so I was never bored by it, that is the really good thing, and the amount of action is like from the beginning to the end. The little problem for me was that there isn’t much of character development in the movie at all. It was all really brief and didn’t satisfy me at all. Some character appearance is just too brief and didn’t even emphasize them.Otherwise the CGI and effect was truly awesome with a great detail, the voice really go well with each character. It was nice to see that Freddie kid in an American accent and doing double roles, and he did it pretty alright. And his sister was alright too, but it was the adult that give out a very bland performance and weird lines.Overall it was very fun movie to watch, with everything that work out pretty well (also great direction, and lighting, and score) apart from too brief of character, but since it is intended for young adult, I say it was alright, don’t go too serious on it and just try to enjoy the movie with all the fighting, chasing, flying, screaming.Recommendation: Yeah Sure, Watch it when you’re Bored and Nothing to Do.Reason to Watch: Bored and have to watch something.Reason not to: It was fun at the time, but then forgot about it.Rating: 7/10 (Grade: C+).Please rate Y/N after read.",The Spiderwick Chronicles
55,LoneWolfAndCub,The Spiderwick Chronicles stands out among the recent crop of lacklustre fantasy films,7,25 April 2008,"It has been awhile since I have seen such an enjoyable fantasy film. Unlike the over-hyped Harry Potter films, the terrible Eragorn and the bland Stardust, this movie is a funny, exciting and touching journey. That is, if you can forget some clichéd themes and stories. What I liked was the suitably dark tone and the surprising amount of violence for a film aimed at young children...didn't bother me though! The story is by now common to most children movie fanatics. A single mother (Mary-Louise Parker) moves out of a big city to a run-down house in a small town. There is the older sister (Sarah Bolger) and the twin brothers (both played by Freddie Highmore), one is a self-proclaimed pacifist and the other a rebel. Jared, the rebel, discovers a book that unleashes an alternate world full of goblins, trolls and fairies.So, apart from the mum-struggling-with-divorce motif and the nobody-believes-me-but-I-can-see-them plot builder this is a fun and not too long fantasy flick with some believable CGI, some great actors and voice acting and a fast pace.

For in it he finds the way to look into another world full of creatures that are otherwise not visible.Fairy tales and fantasy often start like that. There's a goblin or an ogre behind every tree, but you don't see them so they can't really harm you. Usually there's good and dark forces and in this film this isn't any different. All the usual things are there: a bit of mystery, an enemy to fight, friends in the weirdest places. And although this film is in that aspect build up using the most standard building blocks it is a good one.The reason behind that is easy: it's fast paced. It picks up quickly and doesn't let go of the accelerator until the last problem is fixed. As the characters chase through the story and are more and more involved into what is happening around them it is clear that they can't stop and will not stop until they are ready. Added to that is the very positive fact that the computer generated graphics for the fairy tale creatures are good and in many ways extremely funny. The combination is extremely pleasant to watch and goes by rather quickly.In fact, it goes by so quickly that the film looks and feels short and that's the only thing I really have against it. It should have been stretched by 20 to 30 minutes and that would have made it all the more pleasant.Easy to watch, good for kids aged 8 to 12 and very pleasant.8 out of 10 trolls in the dungeon",The Spiderwick Chronicles

You can't make a 1 1/2 hour film from a short story, so in this case you need to combine the stories, and for me they have done that brilliantly, the screenplay is seamless, you would think it was all one story, and now it is.There is a strong adult cast, particularly Joan Plowright as Aunt Lucinda and the same with the children, and they are all great, the CGI special effects, particularly with the goblins is excellent, as is the screenplay, direction, photography and music, it is difficult to find fault with it, so I am not going to try.

There is nothing about this film that makes it standout. It's not that it's bad, it's just not good either. I can't remember the last time I saw a film that made me feel...well nothing. Usually when I watch a film I have some sort of feeling about it whether I hate it or love it. I felt nothing while watching this. It is a cliché' ridden script with some awful dialog that spews out of the very uninteresting characters. Someday Freddy Highmore (doing his best American Twin impression (he's English) he can muster) will be a big star, but even he can't save this. Now the sister whoever the girl was, wow she was really bad. I don't know if I should blame her or what, but her character could have easily just been left out. Each character in a film, especially the main characters, should have some sort of purpose for being in it. Mary-Louise Parker as the mom, no matter how good of an actress she is (See her in the excellent show ""Weeds"" for proof) was absolutely totally wasted in this film. If you are a kid under the age of 12 then you probably will enjoy this film. Anyone else, don't bother. This flick is not very good or very entertaining.

Also it rely's way too much on CGI. I've said it before, I like CGI, CGI is fine with me if it isn't completely abused. And it isn't bad CGI, but it is noticeable, and I feel that the film should have had at least a little bit of practical effects on the magical creatures.I don't really have any more problems with it. It doesn't talk down to it's audience. It follows the books really well. The young actors do a really good job, especially Freddie Highmore, who plays two characters who are complete opposites. I love home invasion stories, so the fact that they changed the end battle from a junkyard to the house. And it's just a really good fantasy adventure. It has all the magic creatures we expect, goblins, ogres, brownies, trolls, even sprites.Like I said, this film doesn't revolutionize the fantasy genre, it's just a fun adventure that brings you into a magical world of faeries.",The Spiderwick Chronicles
62,mirosuionitsaki2,Wonderful Children's Movie!,10,20 February 2008,"After many years of children reading the book series, a movie is finally made. No, this is not like A Series of Unfortunate Events. The movie follows the plot very well from what I've heard, and I will agree on that! What is the plot you might ask? I'll tell you. Two boys, a woman, and their mother all named Jared Grace, Simon Grace, Sarah Bolger, and the mother Helen Grace. They all move into an old house after leaving New York because their mother can no longer afford it. Jared finds a book in an old hidden room in the attic, and once he opens it, all hell breaks loose. Goblins start coming to look for that book. In the end, of course, is a happy ending. The whole family except their dad attacks an evil demon. What a great family adventure! ""Now what did you do for your summer vacation?"" ""My family and I battled an evil demon with knives and tomato sauce!"" This movie is fun for not only children, but for adults. This is a superb film. Everything was done wonderfully. Thank goodness they hired good actors!",The Spiderwick Chronicles
63,jemps918,exciting and interesting even for adults,8,3 March 2008,"Cute, fun and entertaining! Saw The Spiderwick Chronicles alone but it was exciting and interesting even for adults.Adorable child star Freddie Highmore has a more mature role and plays twins Jared and Simon Grace, who, along with their older sister Mallory (Sarah Bolger), reluctantly move into the old Spiderwick house as a result of their parents' separation. Mary-Louise Parker plays their mom Helen, and Andrew McCarthy has a tiny part as their dad Richard.Jared has a track record of mischief, and soon enough, discovers the book that is the life's work of Arthur Spiderwick (David Strathairn). He encounters Thimbletack (voice by Martin Short), the honey-hungry boggart that guards the book being valiantly kept from the evil, shape-shifting ogre Mulgarath (Nick Nolte). Somehow, he is able to convince his siblings about the enchanted creatures he ultimately sees and they have to act fast to, of course, save the worlds: theirs and ours.The special effects are pretty good and the meshing of old mythology and more original ones work together pretty well. The characters are unique but not too out-of-the-world for the audience to relate with; complex but likable; riddled with real-world disappointments but teaches kids to suck it up and make the most out of bad situations. An amazing kiddie fantasy flick that isn't too preachy.",The Spiderwick Chronicles
64,helmutty,The spiderwick chronicles,6,7 March 2008,"More children fantasy books are being made, for sample Eragon, The seeker: the dark is rising etc. The spiderwick chronicles is one of them. It is another children fantasy flick. Freddie Highmore is becoming a popular actor, he acts in children fantasy movies like Charlie and the chocolate factory, The Golden compass etc. He is famous for acting in this kind of flicks. You can expect more of him in future fantasy movies.The story: It is not that special but at least you get to see special effects like the goblins. The story is about three kids running away from goblins and they run and run. The only thing is good are the effects of the goblins or monsters. At least the director made the effort to make the goblins look real. If not because of that, it can be quite plain. I have not really read the book but I know they kept some scenes in book in the movie.Overall: If you like watching fantasy movies like Eragon, The chronicles of Narnia or any other fantasy movies involving monsters, you will like this. It is not bad for a fantasy movie but it is a little plain which will be boring. It is quite dark too. Those who lost hope on this, there will be more fantasy movies coming up like the sequel of Narnia movie and Harry Potter and the half Blood prince. I am pretty sure that more children fantasy books will be adapted.",The Spiderwick Chronicles
65,mr_popcorn,spider-wicked!,8,14 December 2008,"Despite a couple of setbacks, Spiderwick Chronicles comes out strong mixing a good amount of family fun and delicious CG effects. For every big hit success like The Lord of the Rings and Harry Potter there's always the not-so-big and barely unnoticed The Seeker: The Dark is Rising (bet you haven't heard of it) and Bridge to Terabithia. Personally, I think Spiderwick Chronicles belongs with Harry Potter and LotR. It was a commercial success and most critics loved it. They incorporated all key elements in all five books and made it compact and neat in such a short amount of time. Whereas Harry Potter's saga is still on-going, Spiderwick Chronicles got the job done in a 90+ minute motion picture. The storyline is well done, the acting is quite good. From Freddie Highmore's dual roles to Sarah Bolger and Mary-Louise Parker, they gave very convincing acts. Nick Nolte is a bad guy, Martin Short is a rat (I think) and Seth Rogen is a bird eating hog. All is well in Spiderwick land and I had a good time watching it. If you need your daily dose of some fantasy treat, this movie is highly recommended.",The Spiderwick Chronicles

69,barbagvido,"Wasn't impressed at first, but loved it later",8,27 November 2015,"I read all the books when I was 12 and I loved them and really looked forward to watching a movie. Back then, I was disappointed because it didn't stick to the plot of the books, but when I got a little older, I reread the series (Lucinda's Secret, that used to be my least favorite book and now is my favorite) and rewatched the movie and I liked it much more. The books are really short so they put it all in one movie and most of the plot happens in one day, while in the books it's about a month. Goblins look a little bit fake at times, but CGI is still pretty good. Acting is really good, and Freddie Highmore is a really talented young actor and he also plays two roles in this movie, but he does it so well, it actually seems like two actors. His characters are twins, but their personalities are different and Highmore absolutely nails it! As an adaptation, it feels really rushed and a lot of things were changed. The Field Guide was probably the most faithful part and still didn't have a half of that book's plot. There was the beginning of The Seeing Stone, first half of Lucinda's Secret, none of The Iron Tree, and the ending of Mulgarath's Wrath and the rest is made up and most if it is squeezed in one day so it feels kinda rushed. This is a movie for kids, but still pretty serious and dramatic in some parts because it has that subplot about divorcing and how that affects the children and that part was very well done. If they gave this movie more space to breathe, it would be awesome, but this way it's still really good.",The Spiderwick Chronicles
70,janyeap,revs up that 'inner child' in all of us!,10,2 February 2008,"A movie that will definitely plunge the audience young and old - into plenty of film-watching fun with its strange and fantastical mysteries, challenges, unpredictable chills and thrills. Examine the Spiderwick Estate with its crumbling mansion that the three Grace children and their mother must now consider as 'home'. Yep, a mansion that seems more like a haunted house whispering to be explored, and one where invisible eyes seems to watch or stalk at every corner. Yet, there's more these family members must need to confront than just a spooky home. The film's introduction to David Stratham's Arthur does give subtle hints of the horrifying events to come, but only its ending will eventually expose the dark secrets, not only of their family heritage, but of the family's burden. Yep this film does have abundance of twists and turns to keep the audience emotionally glued to the screen.Watching Freddie Highmore slip into the roles of the twins, Jared and Simon, is simply astounding. The film does focus on Jared's rebelliously thoughtless and unpredictable character yep, his uncontrollable fits and tempers, his raging and bold independence, and his unwillingness to cooperate nature, so marvelously molded into the story as in Tony DiTerlizzi and Holly Black's book series, offering credible connection to the story's characters and eventful occurrences. I had expected the supporting actors to play fiddle to to the prominence of the main character, yet here, it's Highmore's Jared who seems to hold the support for the need and purpose of the rest of the characters. The talented young actor exhibits that fabulously well. Just observe how his despair gets from bad to worse to provoke the other characters' reactions and to win over the audience's compassion in seeing him as the victim of injustice! Yep, Highmore does lash out his two roles with perfect treatment to reveal the differences in traits and personalities. Well done, Highmore! This movie does give a good summary of the book series without going chronically to a tee, nor does it exactly flush out everything that follows in the series. Yet, the main substances are present, cleverly crafted to keep everything dancing and integrated in spectacularly satisfying momentum and perspective for the film version. Director Mark Waters has successfully flashed out even the boggarts' emotional traits and temperaments that are common to Simon's very much in line with the book series. Book fans of the Spiderwick Chronicles will especially be delighted to see Arthur Rackham's book illustrations of Thimbletack, the faerie creatures, Mulgarath the ogre and his ferociously evil goblins, and even the griffin and Hogsqueal, come alive on the screen. The voices of all the characters are well articulated, succeeding in generating audience appeal and interactions throughout, and the scenes are at well-defined pacing to keep the audience's adrenalin flowing. Watch out for the very brief live-cameo take of Nick Nolte who provides the voice of Mulgarath. A unique list of intriguing characters presented by a well selected team of performers! A great, fun and excitement-filled family film, but there exists some really scary and violent visual moments. Parents should take heed when making decisions to bring kids under 8 to see it. It did trigger off some of those memorable highlights of films, like Jumanji, the Harry Potter and Narnia film series without being condescending in its approach. I was fully swept into it and, oh yes, I love it!",The Spiderwick Chronicles

And Mark Waters has certainly proved this true after leading a superb cast and crew to beautiful success that we all are able to see in the form of one of the best imaginative pieces of cinema of the twenty-first century.We first meet our heroes the three Grace children  twin brothers Jared and Simon (both played beautifully by the remarkable Freddie Highmore) and their older sister Mallory (Sarah Bolger)  when they have just been tragically detached from their father and are forced to move into the ancient, eerily mysterious mansion once owned by their great, great uncle Arthur Spiderwick (David Straithairn) with their mother (Mary Louise Parker.) Jared feels emotionally torn apart by this devastating situation and starts horribly releasing his unhappiness on his family, who don't seem to understand him at all.As he is smashing holes in the walls of the house that dares to try and replace his dear old home with his beloved dad he finds locked up in a carefully hidden chest a mysterious forbidden volume... After opening it  despite the grave warning note  he finds it to be a field guide containing the secret discoveries made by his great, great uncle of the numerous fascinating magical creatures that live all around us, using magic to conceal them from sight. But as soon as this manuscript of priceless information is removed from its only safe place of protection waiting spirits of evil perceive its location and excitedly alert their master  the monstrous, shape-shifting ogre Molgorath (played as a human by Nick Nolte.) So Jared, Simon and Mallory must bravely battle vicious goblins, deceivingly beautiful pixies and the temper tantrums of a honey-loving little beast named Thimbletack (voiced by Martin Short) to protect the book and save both worlds from the terrible monster's deadly wrath.Highly impressive visual effects and spectacular performances from the carefully selected cast add quality to a most captivating screen-telling of Tony DiTerilzzi & Holly Black's bestselling series of novels that has just the right balance of action and dialogue.

I could also let pass that they were making one movie because as I was reading them I knew if Iwas to make a movie I would have made one movie out of all of the books. These books are about one hundred pages long. It is not exactly difficult to make a faithful adaption of these books. There are five books. Five hundred pages. Not hard. The brilliant director (cough, cough) though well we don't need the fourth book and then read the others and though hey, why don't I put this bit that happens near the end at the beginning. Why don't I make this up to make the cinematic experience all the greater? I think it is an insult to call this movie 'The Spiderwick Chronicles.'

The effects are really good too, easily beating the disappointing Narnia ones (looked way too fake, and silly). I really liked how they showed a different version of goblins, compared to the LOTR trilogy. The acting is OK, sort of scratchy in parts, but it doesn't hurt the film too much in my opinion.Overall, this is one of the most entertaining fantasy films I have seen in a long time.

78,Jinn,"Magical, Mystical, thought provoking - although wanted more faerie folk!!",6,1 May 2008,"I have not yet read the books, though I plan to. I loved the movie, despite it being short. Freddie Highmore was great as always. A very different character from his 'August Rush,' which I adored - and here he pulled off the roles of the two brothers brilliantly. I also adored Sarah Bolgen as Mallory. Those swords rocked! A woman after my own medal ;) I also liked Arthur Spiderwick – David Strathairn was wonderful and Lucy – it was lovely to see Joan Plowright again from 'Mrs Palfrey at the Claremont; - and those gorgeous flower fairies! The movie was touching, in many ways, overcoming family problems, helping those in need, and finding oneself, and overcoming anger. In many ways a parallel to the ordeals, trials and tribulations of real life.I went to see it with my mother, who is also intrigued by the fantasy world. We previously bought the Arthur Spiderwick's Calendar for 2008 and have it up in the kitchen. Such lovely artwork. A thing both my mother and I did find disappointing was that we didn't see many of the faerie creatures in the movie. Too many goblins! We wanted to see the Wood Elves, the Unicorns, Field Pixies, Clumps and the Pacific Sea Maids. Hopefully in sequels we'll get to see more of Arthur Spiderwick's magical folk. The Spiderwick key and the field guide book looked wonderful, and the effects were great, especially the protective circle shield and the energy wave from the house when the book was opened...Why are people comparing this movie to Lord of the Rings and Harry Potter? It is neither and this is a rip off of neither. And nor is it The Golden Compass or Narnia, which like this one are series also. If fantasy movies were all the same what would be the point? People say things like 'I was expecting it to be like ... and was disappointed that it was different' ... Helloooo People – diversity is the spice of life. If everything was the same, Gods we'd live in a boring, lifeless world. Enjoy the difference. It's what makes life interesting. One viewer even commented here that the movie was shocking as it had a boy stabbing his father. Did the woman really *watch* the movie? And they weren't knives, they were swords – fighting to defend themselves, their family and friends and the fate of two worlds hung in the balance. The boy -- Jared is his name, dear - stabbed Mulgarath, the Ogre who had cruelly assumed the form of his estranged father to win his trust – and planned to kill Jared, his entire family, destroy the faerie world - and from there destroy our world as well – and Jared stabbed the *ogre* to save everyone Frankly, I'd be more worried about that reviewer's atrocious grammar and lack of observation than Mulgarath ! And in any case, Mulgarath got his just desserts in the end – or rather Hogsqueal did! A real yummy desert! ;) Despite the naysayers, and the overdoing of the goblins, and more faerie folk needed, the movie left me with a lovely sense of magic, wonder and enchantment, taking that magic from the theatre home with me ...",The Spiderwick Chronicles
79,k844140,Decent family film,7,28 July 2021,"I was a child when this film released and really liked it so much, cause every child dreams of such adventures. But being an adult spoiled an impression about this film a bit. Now I see that it isn't perfect. Nevertheless, while children can be amazed by this movie, adults wouldn't be bored. It is really a family film, though parents would like it less. But it is a typical 00's fantasy film which wanted to repeat a LOTR's success but lacked an art in it. While watching The Lord of the Rings in adult age you will probably like it more than in childhood cause it is a real work of art, drawbacks of The Spiderwick Chronicles are obvious while watching it being over 20 y.o. First is that it is too hasty. Without titles it would run for an hour and a half, and it's okay for children who don't like long movies, but makes the movie less understandable. I think the creators should have made it 20 minutes longer to let us feel the atmosphere better and to represent the characters more thoroughly. The other drawback is Freddie Highmore. His performance is not good enough in both his roles. Other actors are good, though not incredible. Sarah Bolger looks much more convincing, though she was only one year older and wasn't that experienced. But still it is just a child movie, so don't be so serious about it. You can surely watch it with your child and wouldn't be disappointed.",The Spiderwick Chronicles
80,ghettodogaudio06,Fantastic New Age Fantasy Film,10,21 June 2008,Amazing New Age Fantasy Film. I thought this film was even better then I anticipated and should have seen it in theaters. The Spiderwick Chronicles is a take off from The Never Ending Story Fantasy Genre where there is a magic book and the book and real life collide. This 2008 film doesn't have that cheesy 80's vibe or music but has stylish orchestral scores by James Horner. Visual Effects are slickly impressive from ILM and with some big voice talents with the ever fantastic Martin Short and Seth Rogen as well. Also starring Mary Louise Parker from hit Showcase TV show Weeds. I love her as the pot dealing suburban mom on Weeds as I love that show but they could have found a better female lead. All the kids in the movie were good actors and I loved this film as Bridge To Terabethia had lots of soul but no crazy visuals. I also hated The Last Mimzy as it sucked. This film was great. It's not too long. It's special effects are great and the story is very well constructed and original as it is different from The Never Ending Story. I understand that this film is based from a series of books and I don't read enough for a fantasy fan. I hope they make another film as this film has potential to continue. Great Film and I wish they made more films in this genre this well or as good.,The Spiderwick Chronicles
81,Pilsung89,"Good, but not really superb",7,20 April 2008,"I saw The Spiderwick Chronicles being advertised for the longest time in theaters as well as on TV. That being said, I was pretty anxious to see it when it finally came out. After seeing it, I thought it was good, but not worth all the hype it received.It's an enjoyable fantasy film, as it delivers it's material quite well. The problem is that it felt very typical and clichéd, as well as predictable at times. This has been a problem with many recent movies The story is that a couple gets a nasty separation, and the mother moves with the children to a house that turns out to be in the middle of an unseen realm of mythical creatures. One by one they grip this reality and get involved in the good/evil struggle of the unseen world. This is a pretty typical plot, and there's not much originality to it.The acting is pretty good. Freddie Highmore does well in the dual role of twin brothers Jared and Simon Grace. Sarah Bolger plays the part of older sister Mallory Grace pretty well. The relationships, however, are part of the cliché problem. The relationship between the siblings is the stereotypical one that's been used for decades. The pranks on the sister, and the sister's attempt to act like the dominant one are very typical brother/sister elements. The mother/children relationship has the same problems. There's nothing that makes the relations between the characters memorable or unique to this specific film. However, it feels like the relationship stereotypes are the result of the script, not the actors' performances. The actors handle their given roles quite well.The movie uses many typically overused lines such as ""now do you believe me,"" ""death or vengeance, hopefully vengeance"", and ""Mom's gone, so I'm in charge."" There are also very stock scenes such as the scene where Jared finds a book that says: Warning, Don't read this book or bad things can happen! Of course he reads it right away.The fantasy and magical element was very good, and pretty believable. This was one of the movie's best qualities. The CGI does well in creating the mystical creatures. My only complaint was that we only get to see a few of the 'good' creatures from the other world. There you go. A magical fantasy story with good acting and awesome computer graphics. The main problems are the lack of originality in both the story and dialogue, as well as the stereotypical characters. I'd say it's worth seeing, just don't hold any high expectations. Just expect fun and mildly entertaining movie. I give it a 7/10.",The Spiderwick Chronicles
82,flyingamon,Surprisingly good,7,17 April 2011,"Fantasy movies taking place in our modern times and our world is usually not such a good combination for me. And although Spiderwick Chronicles is just that, it does a good job in surprising me with a pleasant story. While not exactly in the league of for example Chronicles of Narnia or the Golden Compass, it does have an interesting story that offers excitement and something new and refreshing (in my opinion). I particularly liked the fact that the 2 twin brothers were so different (one was so excited about discovering new things and the other just didn't care). And there was their older sister who might come across as mean first but which is merely frustration. When their house in the woods is invaded by invisible goblins they are forced to work together despite being so different which brings them closer together as a family. I think it's a beautiful message too that in times of need a family forgets about their daily squabbles and put up for each other actually strengthening their bound. It's maybe not a movie I would re-watch that much but it's certainly one that has a place in my collection.",The Spiderwick Chronicles

In my opinion, this would've been more suitable.Another negative point may be the length, i thought more could've been added to the film to make it feel more coherent.Overall, a fun, exciting, adventurous and ultimately engaging family film with not a lot to say against it.",The Spiderwick Chronicles
84,nbwritersinbox,Fantasy With Finesse (And A Few Borrowed Ideas),8,28 November 2011,"Benefiting from Deschanel's superb cinematography, this fantasy adventure has moments of elegant finesse that make it unusual in terms of modern (often brutal) cinema. The gentler ""faerie"" sequences and closing credits were like a lullaby for the eyes. Helped considerably by Horner's enchanting score.A well-constructed screenplay keeps the action flowing, while there's enough common-sense in the script to establish the main characters. There's even humorous asides, but these were too few to lift my spirits, as Jared and other family members deal with the emotional destruction of divorce.The writing takes a different approach to JK Rowling's since, here, Jared has to assume the role of a missing father, while Harry Potter is tasked with rebuilding a sense of family from scratch. Although, divorce as a topic is well-worth exploring, since it haunts modern society. JK Rowling tends to ignore that difficult issue entirely.Parallels with Harry Potter are unavoidable. Spiderwick's ""Griffin"" sequences were far too reminiscent of those seen at Hogworts. Nil points for originality there. Paramount obviously decided to compete with Warner Brothers for a highly lucrative ""fantasy film"" audience. Hijacking an idea wholesale didn't impress.Goblin sequences relied too heavily on CGI, although Thimbletack limited the damage by being a new CGI ""take"" on the ""house-elf"". Plowright (as Lucinda) and Highmore (in a dual-role) acted their socks off, not helped much by mediocre support.

I can't fault the acting and was particularly taken with the character of Thimbletack (Martin Short, I believe). That said, the film never really took off, for me. There was a fair bit of information giving about the book the children discover, the strange creatures they encounter and their family history, but the main part of the story (i.e. their attempts to discover a way of defeating Mulgarath) seemed quite superfluous as a result. There were enough humorous parts to the story to make it worth watching, even for adults, but I suspect it's one mainly for the kids.",The Spiderwick Chronicles

It is an almost forgotten pleasure to enjoy a film where the story is as important to the director as his film-craft.This is a children's tale and there is just enough menace and terror to excite and frighten its intended audience without ever going too far. And in addition there is also more than enough joy, humour and healing in it to easily offset the darker moments.The acting is for the most-part, good, with Sarah Bolger (Malory) easily the best and carrying her every scene.Watch and saver this film and I hope you enjoy it as much as I did.",The Spiderwick Chronicles

When he, Simon and Mallory investigate what's really going on, they uncover the fantastic truth of the Spiderwick estate and of the creatures that inhabit it.Well directed with an interesting story that keeps you watching. Good acting all round, the CGI effects were well implemented too, with various characters and creatures popping up here and there to provide comedic relief and action pivotal plot development. The film was well paced and doesn't feel its been rushed. The other excellent transformations are when Mulgarath shape shifts at different points in the movie.

It seemed like a fantasy-action-adventure type of film and though I really enjoyed the Harry Potter and Narnia films, I didn't think I'd enjoy this one. It seemed so ""kiddie"" to me at first and I really wasn't going to see it. However, I changed my mind and decided to see it anyways and it wasn't at all what I expected.The film had a lot of action scenes (along with the fantasy) that kept me on the edge of my seat, surprisingly. Looking back after seeing the film, I don't remember feeling bored at all. The Spiderwick Chronicles isn't just about fighting off computer-generated monsters, there was also a lot of heart in the film too.The acting was wonderful. I've got to say that Freddie Highmore was phenomenal! That kid blows my mind! He never ceases to amaze me! There's not one movie I watched with him in it that didn't make me well up because he always seem to well up at the right moments in the film. He makes me want to jump into the screen and give him a hug but of course, I can't do that so I just sit in my seat, go ""Aww..."" and hope I don't start crying.I also know he's British so hearing him have an American accent amazed me. I actually waited for him to slip but halfway through the film, I forgot to listen for mistakes and just started really enjoying the movie.When the movie was over, it still sort of stayed in my system. I was still pretty choked up even though the ending was light and very happy as almost every kid's movie is. It's more than a fantasy film. It's a warm family movie too and on those days when I'd like to watch something that has a lot of fantasy and action yet tugs on my heartstrings, I'd go see this one.9/10 because surprisingly, I really enjoyed it!",The Spiderwick Chronicles
101,barnes-183,by-the-numbers fantasy adventure for kids,5,24 February 2008,"This movie is enjoyable but when it is all over you realize that it was empty calories and no substance. The movie can't help but be enjoyable to watch as they obviously used data culled by a team of researchers to make the film. Past research determined how much time would elapse before the magic elements showed up, the time between edits, the type of music that would work best at each juncture, and the balance of action, humor, and character development. Probably some researcher determined that rabid Martin short fans had almost no overlap with rabid Nick Nolte fans. Thus by casting these particular two actors, you get a box office bonus that is not squandered by overlapping fan populations. The film makers learned from a host of better films how to do kids fantasy and followed the formula. No risks were taken here at all.Of course, movies pitched towards kids generally are not known for taking risks. So, while this movie may rate a 5 for adults, it may be an 8 or 9 for 14-year-old boys & girls.One thing I will add is that following the Harry Potter trend, the violence is pitched for the older kids and is likely to be too much for 6-year-old children.",The Spiderwick Chronicles

There is the magic book or the field diary, hidden creatures that are invisible, there is the circle of protection to keep the enemy at shores, plenty of fast paced action and magnificent graphics that transport you to a whole new world. The only major difference seems to be that, the object of contention, which is the field diary in this movie is with the good people and they seek to protect it and have to travel nowhere to capture it from the wrong hands.There is an eerie start at the beginning of the movie much akin to horror flicks and there seems to be vile in the air around you. It later unfolds into a mind boggling experience with sterling performance from Freddie Highmore. A thorough entertainer for all ages.There is also the inevitable human touch to the movie that is primarily hallucinatory. The climax was brilliant and in general you will at the edge of your sets for most part of this film.

They were also very much apart of my childhood and on the release of this film i was quite excited.After seeing it however i really wished i hadn't even bothered, another pathetic attempt to make books into movies. I do hope another company decide to remake this much loved series again and cast correctly and not rush the script.It was awful watching an extremely bright idea go up in smoke, so awful that i never picked up the books again. The main fault you ask? Freddie Highmore.An English actor playing an American?, i at least thought he would keep his signature accent but then when he opened his mouth and said 'Mallory.' i couldn't believe it ! He is horrible ! Maybe next time they should animate such a brilliant idea instead of cramming it into two-hour waste of money production.But on that note i would like to say a formal thank-you to Mr. Freddie Highmore: Thankyou for ruining one of the best book series ever written with your pathetic and overrated acting skills.And if you ever say 'Mallory' in that American-accent-i-don't-think-so voice of yours again i will ensure your overpaid acting days are well and truly over.",The Spiderwick Chronicles

Although the special effects were good they did not have to make up for any flaws in this film. The story could be interesting to both kids and children, and has a good theme about how to move on in life when things change and how to deal with stress in the family,so maybe a good one for the holidays. There are some fight scenes but nothing too gruesome and very good role models and characters in both male and female characters. I just loved this movie and now need to read the books. I felt though some parts were really interesting and could have been developed more, sometimes the movie just moves along to quickly almost seeming to leave loose ends. Also more scenes with just the fantasy characters not interacting with the human characters. But this story was really heart warming and entertaining and reminded me of favorite children's books of my childhood.",The Spiderwick Chronicles
106,rob-macklin,Better than expected,7,15 April 2008,"Hey, I enjoyed this film and was pleasantly surprised.I wasn't too sure what to expect as these types of films can be a bit child-like but the makers were very restrained and kept the corn on the cob.There were plenty of likable characters, the humour was mature and the special effects were top notch.I thought Nick Nolte, who was virtually unrecognizable in this role, was excellent.We saw the emergence of a soon to be star in Sarah Bolger, who plays Mallory, the older troubled sister. I'm sure she will go on to bigger and better things.But the real star of the film is Freddie Highmore who plays two roles in the film, doubling as his brother. He's definitely the new Haley Joel Osment. He gives a very real, truthful performance which I found very engaging.There was even a few scary moments where the whole audience jumped which is always great fun Overall a very well made film with a good and satisfying ending, enjoyable for all ages.",The Spiderwick Chronicles
107,shaws4god,Not For Younger Children,5,24 February 2008,"Having read and enjoyed the books, I was surprised by some aspects of the Spiderwick movie. A warning to parents of children 9 and under: this movie is quite scary, and contains violence - yes, violence. There are many sword slashing scenes which feature puncturing, slashing, biting and blood. While most of the blood is monster (green) blood, Spiderwick also features scenes which reveal monster bites that make the monsters much more scarier and real than your average children's flick.Spoiler below....Another disappointing aspect to Spiderwick is the portrayal of the father. The father is seen as cold, uncaring, and unloving. The father cheats on his wife, abandons her, and abandons the children - even at the end of the movie. Lastly, there is a scene in which it appears that the father has come to the rescue, but in reality, the father is actually a hideous monster in disguise.Why Spiderwick goes out of its way to portray fathers in such a very negative light to such a young and impressionable audience baffles me. This is careless, cruel and irresponsible.The movie could have easily - by a country mile - left the blood, violence and father bashing out, and Spiderwick would have been a 8-10 star movie. With the ""junk"" left in, it was 5 stars at best.In conclusion, I wouldn't say this is a movie for children under 10 unless a parent is involved. My younger daughter was scared to death by what was taking place on screen. Older children should be able to process the violence and father-bashing a little better.",The Spiderwick Chronicles
108,jannayu-subaju,interesting,5,23 March 2012,"What surprised me the most was actually the length of the film. It was fairly short (90 minutes) and I felt that the producers made a huge mistake by attempting to cram all five books into one film instead of dividing them into separate features. I had recognized a few of the scenes from the books, but overall it seemed very rushed and excluded many of the series most exciting moments. Any fan of the books would probably be disappointed in the way the series was handled and executed.As for the rest of film, I thought it was well done. The CGI continues to be to focal point in most of these types of family films and the producers spent a great time with its detail and design. The fairies looked neat, the goblins were frightening, and the big bad ogre looked well big and bad.Overall, I would say this film would make for a great matinée on a Sunday with the kids. There are several moments that may scare children under the age of five, but otherwise it should appeal to children of all ages.",The Spiderwick Chronicles
109,philipaustin19,Pretty Lame Even for Kids Movie Expectations,5,25 February 2008,"I'm going to film school to be a family filmmaker. I did my part by buying tickets to this show. But I was very disappointed.I didn't read the books so I'm not going to complain about the poor adaptation or any of that. Basically the plot goes nowhere. Nothing is ever introduced that matters a whole lot, the story never gets going and by the end of it I could care less. Here's a thought: A hero needs a goal! I wasn't distracted enough by the special effects or the world-outside-our own either.Three bright spots: Music: it was great, obviously the studio dumped some money into this thing to get James Horner to do the soundtrack. Acting: Freddy Highmore did a great job. It was so distracting to see him play his own twin though. Was it necessary? Or just distracting? I think it's the latter. Why not let him speak with his native accent as well? What's the point? Cinematography: every shot was in focus and well framed, sequences flowed nicely etc. All of these people did their jobs, but the writing was crap. You can't cover poor narrative with a Tom Hanks performance (I.E. Da Vinci Code). I'll say it again: a hero needs a goal! Juno's got to deal with the baby, Bruce Willis has to stop the terrorists and Marty has to get his parents back together and then get back to 1985! Got it?",The Spiderwick Chronicles
110,jbonner71,"The Spiderwick Chronicles is Cool, but No Potter-esque Franchise",7,6 February 2014,"The Spiderwick Chronicles is a fine, family film in the tradition of Harry Potter and The Golden Compass, and like those other franchises, it is based on a beloved series of children's books. Although I would strongly argue that Philip Pullman's His Dark Materials trilogy (from which The Golden Compass comes) goes far beyond simple ""good vs. evil"" children's fare; that is an argument best suited for another time and placeThe basic plot line of The Spiderwick Chronicles goes like this: upon moving into the dilapidated Spiderwick Estate with their mother, Helen (the MILF-tastic Mary-Louise Parker), the Grace children — twin brothers Jared and Simon (both played with aplomb by Freddie Highmore) and their sister Mallory (Sarah Bolger) — find themselves pulled into an alternate world full of fantastical creatures.Unable to explain the mysterious occurrences that seem to be happening on a daily basis, the family finds a scapegoat in the unruly Jared. When he, Simon, and Mallory stumble upon Arthur Spiderwick's Field Guide and begin to look into what's really going on, they uncover the incredible truth of the Spiderwick Estate and of the creatures that populate it.In and of itself, the movie is well done, but nothing spectacular, and is carried by the charisma of its two young stars (Highmore and Bolger). There is a ""broken family"" sub-plot that just weighs the film down and feels tacked on. In my opinion, those scenes could've easily been edited out and this would've streamlined the fantasy elements of the film, which are, undoubtedly, its best parts.The DVD I reviewed was of the Blu-ray variety and does offer a superior quality of picture and sound. The digital creature effects seem to jump off the HDTV screen, and the colors, especially in the faerie realm, are truly vibrant and crisp on my monitor set at 1080p. The 5.1 Dolby True HD sound mix is alternately thunderous and airy in the appropriate places, but does seem a bit too center-channel concentrated for my liking. If I'm in an expansive fantasy realm, I want to feel it. Unfortunately, this disc didn't quite get me to that level of aural immersion.The special features found on this disc consist mostly of making of and back-slapping featurettes, which are nicely presented in HD. The best special feature found here is the interactive, enhanced Blu-ray version of the Spiderwick Field Guide that you can access at various points throughout the film when certain creatures pop up or events unfold. This is cool and all but can be distracting on your initial viewing of the film, so you may want to turn this feature on only during subsequent viewings of the movie.At the end of the day, The Spiderwick Chronicles is a solid, if unspectacular, entry into your DVD/Blu-ray collection, especially if you have younger children at home. If you don't have kids, I would suggest a rental over an outright purchase, as it isn't one of those ""showcase"" DVDs that will dazzle your friends and neighbors.",The Spiderwick Chronicles

I would probably put it more in the 13 and under range-it wasn't very scary but did have a few frights in it. The magical creatures were nowhere near to the fear factor as ""Lord of the Rings"" but a little more so than the ones from ""The Chronicles of Narnia"".My favorite part was when I finally realized who the voice of Hogsqueal was and then I wondered why they chose Seth Rogen to do that part because it all made sense in the end with one great scene (spoiler alert?).

The Spiderwick Chronicles is one of those rare films - a good movie made by Nickelodeon Movies, a studio that has gone downhill ever since Clockstoppers was made. But, amazingly, the studio follows through with an amazing movie with vivid CGI, believable characters and Parent Trap-esquire roles played by the same actor that actually works.

I think this theory is right. I was disappointed by Harry Potter 5 at first, but watching it now for a year later and nearly forgetting about the book, I found it the best in the series.The same might as well go with this film. I was disappointed. If you don't know, this film is based on 5 books. However, the movie ignores the 4th book, which is probably because of budget issues and/or limited running time. Still, I can't help but complain. There could've been more creative production designs to see, more action, and more magical creatures.Apart from that, I felt that the film was well put together, especially the fact that they skipped a lot in the books. The special effects are very good, as well as the action scenes. I also may feel this film pushed the PG rating.

Additionally, my kids read the books and said it was an impressive adaptation of all five (!) of the books. Having not read them myself, the movie still felt coherent without missing any parts.I can't recommend it highly, on the basis of its being far too violent, and sometimes downright gory. Now, I'm not a puritan; I like horror movies and my family likes action movies. But the violence was a little too close-up and the monsters too real for a movie described as a family film. We saw close-ups of cut-open eyes and exploded heads. My ten year old walked away disturbed and my three year old (I thought it would be okay by the trailers) spent most of the time with his head underneath my coat. This movie should have been PG-13.Action can be good, even thrilling. Star Wars, Harry Potter, and Narnia all had great family friendly action scenes. The difference, I realized after thinking about it, is that all of the action in this movie was desperate. Not thrilling, just outnumbered, and kind of awful. When the good guys do win, it's sudden and almost random, so you feel less like cheering and more like just unclenching your teeth, glad that it's over.In addition, the non-action scenes weren't fun either. The dialogue outside the action scenes was almost entirely the family being angry at each other. There may be two laughs in the whole movie. Even the ""good"" magical creatures had a kind of sinister look to them. There wasn't a lot to *enjoy* here. You may walk out of the theater saying the movie was ""amazing"" or ""exciting,"" but you won't be able to say that it was ""fun.""",The Spiderwick Chronicles
122,fjhampson,Too many changes from the books.,4,15 February 2008,"If you have read the books you surely have waited with great anticipation for the release of ""The Spiderwick Chronicles."" Well dear reader, there are no Elves, no Fairy Grass, no Phooka, no fencing competition and no nursing a Griffon back to health in the garage.What remains is a much stripped down version of the basic storyline about protecting Great Uncle Arthur's book. It seems to me that film makers are now way more consumed with displaying what can be done with CGI that story telling must be sacrificed. If you haven't read the books you'll probably enjoy it, if you have ADHD you'll be able to follow the simplistic story.There was a great movie to be made here about siblings coming together.In the movie it seems all tense encounters with unfamiliar people must be handled with violence. I know that not everything from a book can be put on the screen but to change the element of battling wits against the Troll to scream, stab, squish, seemed like a cop out to appeal to the simple viewer. Way too much changed or ignored. A huge disappointment. In the words of my 6 year old son, ""What happened to the Dwarfs and their mechanical dogs?""",The Spiderwick Chronicles

Not too scary for our 6 year old son, and interesting enough for our 12 year old daughter and for us (37 and 39.) Great plot & storyline. Special effects were not too cheesy--and easy enough to fall into believing. It was the perfect length; we were mesmerized yet it didn't finish to fast. Definitely worth the $30 for tickets and $20 for snacks. And I am sure we will eventually purchase the DVD when it comes out. This is a great Part 1, hope that Part 2 is as entertaining! This was a wonderful fantasy-- loved the 'pet' and the great aunt and too many things to list!",The Spiderwick Chronicles
124,haroonkamran,A creepy-crawly and digitized faerie tale,10,13 June 2008,"The lasting mystery of ""The Spiderwick Chronicles"" is why the producers cast actors known for rising to a creative challenge - and then gave them so little to do. Mary-Louise Parker, David Strathairn, Nick Nolte, Dame Joan Plowright - Laurence Olivier's widow, for Pete's sake - all rattle around this noisy action-fantasy contraption looking vaguely stunned. And why shouldn't they? The movie's tween age target audience has no idea who they are.Freddie Highmore gets to play twins, though, and that's something. Produced by Nickelodeon and based on a popular book series by Tony DiTerlizzi and Holly Black, ""Spiderwick"" occupies a niche between one of the lower-rent Walden Media young-adult-lit adaptations and ""The Chronicles of Narnia"" - it's ""The Golden Compass"" shrunk down to the size of a few cubic acres.On those acres stands a creepy old house, and into that house move the Graces: newly separated mom (Parker), twins Jared (Highmore) and Simon (Highmore), and teenage daughter Mallory (Sarah Bolger, one of the sisters in ""In America""). Jared is bitter - he doesn't know that dad (a briefly glimpsed Andrew McCarthy) is a cheating rat - and he sulks his way into a hidden study where ancestor Arthur Spiderwick (Strathairn) carried out his studies on the faerie realm.Yes, faeries are real - and brownies and Bogart's and sylphs and goblins - and ""Spiderwick Chronicles"" visualizes them all with duly detailed digitized wonder. Martin Short provides the voice of Thimbletack, a honey-loving house brownie who turns green and bulbous when angered, and there's a piggy hobgoblin who speaks with the frat house swagger of Seth Rogen.Great Uncle Arthur wrote a book about the faeries, though, and ""Spiderwick"" being that sort of movie, it's a book that will Bring About the End of the World if it falls into the hands of Mulgarath, a shape shifting ogre with the voice and occasionally the makeup-larded face of Nolte. Two-thirds of the film consists of the panicked kids fighting off the bellowing forces of evil just outside the house, trying to hide the apocalypse from mom.It's a good movie for its type, but it rarely stops to let us marvel at the world it creates. (It's also an assault of noise, action violence, and slimy-creature effects that will delight kids older than eight and terrify their younger siblings - you've been warned.) When the kids visit Uncle Arthur's daughter, the aged Lucinda (Plowright), we do glimpse some remarkable flower-faeries that could have stepped out of ""Fantasia"" - they're as graceful as the actress herself. More typical are the howling goblins hordes: meticulously rendered hell beasts that look like Hieronymus Bosch's idea of a Surinam toad.The most special effect is probably Highmore, who gets to sharpen up his American accent and who makes each twin, bookish Simon and bad-boy Jared, a functioning individual. In its way, ""The Spiderwick Chronicles"" is a rip snorting, computerized update of E. Nesbit's old fantasy novels for children, and the way brothers and sister band together to deal with the unknown is reminiscent of Nesbit's far gentler and funnier ""Five Children and It."" Maybe Nickelodeon should make that one next, and let Highmore play all the roles. credit Ty Burr, Globe Staff",The Spiderwick Chronicles
125,DancefloorTerrorist,Bird! Bird! Bird!,10,10 March 2008,"Went to a UK preview tonight and this completely took me by surprise. A brilliant fantasy adventure which retains it's dignity and doesn't sell out for a cute Disney style box office attack.The issues in it were quite good and realistic and it wasn't necessarily 'happy ever after' in the end. The scripting and the style of the piece reminded me of 'The Princess Bride'- although this is more of an action adventure than a comedy.Well worth seeing, and there doesn't seem to have been much 'hollywood tailoring' such as there was with the Golden compass and Narnia...As to the monsters / fairies- they were very well done indeed, quite believable considering they were computer generated.Well worth seeing, but I have the feeling it won't get as much publicity as the usual run of the mill children's movie...Why do I keep saying children's movie when I am 34?",The Spiderwick Chronicles

It is one of my favourite movies of all time, and is the best movie of 2008. I really enjoyed the Dark Knight but this was better for me. It is one of the most underrated movies of all time. It may not get an Oscar award though it doesn't matter if you enjoy it which I'm sure you should. Also, I don't think this is a kids movie. Grab a case of Tooheys extra dry, call some mates and get splashed off your heads. Not that i'm condoning alcohol use but I definitely think you should see this movie.Last movies seen: The Matrix: 7/10 Crash: 10/10",The Spiderwick Chronicles

I realize the books were small,but it was only an hour an hour and a half long. The could have made it longer or made more movies. I found myself saying wait a there is something missing. The didn't get very descriptive about certain things,it should have been like an Harry Potter thing how they get very descriptive as possible, but for a younger crowd even though Harry Potter wasn't that scary anyway it could have been better. i give this movie a 5 of how it needed improvement",The Spiderwick Chronicles
128,lwluvgod,Loved it,8,9 March 2008,I truly wasn't expecting much from this movie goon in but it was the only family movie available to watch with my 5 and 3 year old. I figured that because it wasn't a cartoon I'd have to deal with squirming bottoms and talking. But to my amazement the movie was not only entertaining to both of my boys (NO SQUIRMING!!!) both my husband and I loved it. My husband wouldn't even get a refill on the popcorn----and believe me that doesn't happen often!!!! I have nothing negative to say about the film. Some might think it's a little too scarry for younger kids but neither one of mine were scarred. A couple of times I had to explain some things to my 5 year old. The head goblin is kind of scarry looking; but not too bad.,The Spiderwick Chronicles
129,polarbear74,a great stand-alone movie for the 5-12 bracket,7,30 March 2008,"I've not read the books (yes, unusual for me) but the movie was great. And not just because we a) went to a premiere or b) the tickets were free but... Good effects, moved along in a logical fashion, good child acting (some of the adult stuff was a bit lame, although it did depict the wash-up of a painful divorce and move quite well) and both the boys (five and eight) sat thru it, with only one toilet break (very unusual for the littlest one). Both are raving about it to their dad, who decided not to come. The hobgoblin is now their favourite character (move over Optimus, for at least a week) and there has been a lot of reenactment of the final scene (thankfully not involving the spitting).A bit scarier than Narnia, not as much as LOTR or even Transformers, and we'll probably buy the DVD.",The Spiderwick Chronicles
130,varishnee,About as epic as 101 Dalmations,4,3 April 2008,"Based on the bestselling novel by the same name, the Spiderwick Chronicles is about a single mom who moves her three children to a decrepit old mansion in the country to rebuild their lives after a nasty separation.When one of the boys, played by a slightly older and angrier Freddie Highmore (Charlie and the Chocolate Factory), stumbles upon a mysterious book of spells written by a previous occupant of the house (David Strathairn), he unwittingly unleashes the fury of a shape-shifting ogre with an eye on world domination (Nick Nolte).The special effects in the movie are great, as we've come to expect, and the action sequences are gripping, but this does not hide the fact that it's a movie made almost exclusively for ten-year-olds. If you have one, take him or her to see it. The backyard will be littered with wooden swords and the kitchen bare of tomato sauce, salt and honey for at least the next month.That said, the producers almost certainly grasped the movie's limited appeal to a wider audience and in an effort to up box office sales advertised it as the next best thing after Harry Potter and The Chronicles of Narnia, which it decidedly isn't.They say only a fool learns from his own mistakes, so take this bit of advice: don't brave this one without a kid in tow.

131,rokk141,A Magical Movie,8,15 June 2008,"The Spiderwick Chronicles is an enchanting tale that displays Feddie Highmore's talent as an actor. His skillful depiction of two completely different personas is the true magic of this film. My only complaint is the different vocal styles he uses for the two characters shifts sometimes mid-speech.The supporting cast is also to be commended. Mary-Louise Parker is stellar, as would be expected after her experience playing basically the same character archetype in Weeds. Sarah Bolger, Mallory, realistically acts her part without any major flaw.The special effects are to be praised. The depiction of the creatures is unique and a nice change from the Tolken illustrations artists have become accustomed to. The special effects never drew away from the acting, and only added to the experience.At 97 minutes, it is a bit short however, and as the credits began to roll I was left wanting more.",The Spiderwick Chronicles
132,mmafio,Something is wrong with this movie,3,30 June 2013,"First, I'm surprised that most negative reviews (<5 rating) are only from viewers that know the books (or at least one), cause the movie is not good for itself. IMHO one of the biggest mistakes are the characters of the kids. I don't know the book but I can't imagine the children were introduced like this in the original in terms of character development. Whiny, hateful, aggressive, etc... and NO, the breakup of their parents doesn't explain it at all. At least not at this intensity.After the first half-hour I was really like ""meeeh, don't care what happens with them"". Another thing that added to that was the bad acting (but the adults were not better at all). Maybe that's a subjective matter, but I know a lot of movies with child actors and even Freddie Highmore, had seen him playing better in other movies so maybe the reason is to find in the script or directing. Then the seemingly repetitive fighting, where they could had better invest some time in developing the characters, story or the world about the spiderwicks (I read in the commentaries there are five books, so source material shouldn't have been the problem). All in all, the beginning (about the book = 1P) and a few good new ideas here and there (another point) are the only reasons for me to give it 3/10 in the end.",The Spiderwick Chronicles
133,nubby_G,"A decent, fun filled movie that will keep you entertained",7,8 February 2008,"I work at IMAX theaters, and we showed an advanced staff screening tonight. Having been surrounded by posters and trailers for Spiderwick Chronicles for months, I was already sick of the film before I even saw it. But I went into it with an open mind, and found myself pleasantly surprised. The plot centers around a broken family that moves into an old house that has been in the family for years, in hopes of ""starting over"". Freddie Highmore plays two roles, twin brothers Jarod and Simon, and does an impressive job at keeping the two personalities distinct and different. Jarod, the angsty protagonist of the film, discovers a book (titled, the Spiderwick Chronicles) written by his late great uncle depicting in explicit detail the creatures of a ""hidden world"" all around us. Jarod reads the book, and in the process awakens an evil Ogre and a horde of goblins hell bent on obtaining the knowledge hidden within the book to destroy mankind, and creature-kind as well. The pacing is decent, and the acting works well within the context of the film. Oddly, it's the adult actors that deliver the lamest lines, as they seem profoundly out of place in this otherwise fantasy and child actor filled film. The CGI effects were well implemented too, with various characters and creatures popping up here and there to provide comedic relief, and often, pivitol plot development. The various supporting characters do a great job of keeping things moving, most notable being Jarod and Simons sister, Mallory, played by Sarah Bolger, who delivers a great performance. Having never read the books, I can't make any comparisons, but what I saw in the film I liked quite a bit. Not the most complex of movies, and there are some glaring plot holes here and there, but overall, it holds up pretty well, albeit some wonky script writing here and there.",The Spiderwick Chronicles

The characters have all very different personalities and that is a very positive point for the movie because if all the characters have similar behaviour it is going yo be very monotonous.

Now i haven't read the books, though there probably wasn't too much for them to work with, but this movie started off with the feeling that it could easily be a three movie epic. The characters were great and the storyline was captivating but it just didn't feel like we got introduced to this magical world at all.. we only got to see the very tip.

In the book Simon got ""the sight"" once he was rescued, in the movie Simon gets it at the same time as Mallory.

It was a fun, suspenseful movie that engages you from the beginning. I went with my 9 year old daughter and she LOVED IT! I haven't seen such a good children's movie in a long, long time!

139,crimson_faerie_dust,Movie vs Book problem (again),4,18 February 2008,"If you have read the books and you are a fan of them, you may find the movie very annoying. If I had to guess, I would say that 10% of the books made it into this movie. The characters were off and the creatures were not properly portrayed. Jared, Simon and Mallory's father became too important a character. He became almost the only thing that drove Jared's actions. Many of the creatures (such as elves, phooka, fairy grass, and troll(the one in the creek)) were left out. They completely skipped over 'The Ironwood Tree' and just played it off as an underground passage that led from the house to the town.Thimbletack is one of my favorite characters in the books and they portrayed him HORRIBLY! He turned into the boggart whenever he got only slightly irritated and would change back when offered honey from the bottle. He reminded me a bit of a drug addict. I really didn't like how he was shown in the movie.And Mulgarath? He looked completely different from the drawing that is the cover of the last book. He looked more like a giant dog with horns in his head. I was very disappointed in that.Overall, the movie was okay. Since I have read the books, I knew what was going on in the story (at least what was still there), so I do not know how the movie was seen by people who haven't read the books. If you have already seen the movie, read the books. Although they are labeled as being for a younger audience, they are very good books to read. I highly recommend them but do not recommend this movie.",The Spiderwick Chronicles

I thought that this was going to be a touching moment where we really felt for this woman. Didn't happen. She didn't even cry and was fine. They were trying to show us that there was a background for these characters, but they didn't seem to concerned with giving the whole story. Finally, we kind of find out where the dad is...they say something real quick... and then back to the adventure. Maybe they should've concentrated on one or the other.I think these new fantasy movies are trying too hard. Packing a whole lot of material into 2 hours. The TV show Lost is in it's 4th season and we only have background on half the characters. If they want us to feel for the characters, they need more information, otherwise leave it alone.I didn't see the other movies that were out because of the constant sex and language...and this is what was available.

There is a scene where the young boy stabs the father, not by accident, but with a purpose. It is graphic and shocking. Also, the scare factor is too much. My seven year old son, who is all boy, was scared from the movie. My eight year old niece had her head buried in my other daughters shoulder. There are a lot of knife cutting up creature scenes in it. The actual story line was good, so that is what is also disappointing. It could of been a really good film, but they took it to far, for children. I can't believe it got the rating it did. It was very violent. I am not someone who is squimish. Even my older daughter was shocked at it, for the age they are promoting this movie. I wish I would of known more about this movie. I would of made a different choice in what we saw today.

The visual effects are good with lots of creature gore although some are a bit much for the younger ones (<6 years). I wouldn't advise taking a child that scares too easily. There were some children in the theater that were covering their eyes or were snuggled up tight to their parent. Since this is a kid's movie, I also could have also done without the adult subplot of the father having left the mother for another woman and consequently not living up to his promises to his children. It didn't add that much to the plot except for giving the creature a chance at the end to morph into the father to deceive the children. Overall pretty good flick.",The Spiderwick Chronicles

Although I have read the books, there are a few things to say, or maybe a lot. For one thing, the whole fourth book with the Dwarfs and their robot dogs weren't in the movie. I also expected one of the biggest fights, the Dragon versus the Griffin in the movie too. That fight could've made the movie more exiting. Also, for some of you thinking of the part where Jared stabbed his father, THAT WASN'T HIS FATHER!!! He knew that it was the evil Mulgarath in disguise that the goblins summoned because he asked one simple question of what he said on the phone. Since the ""fake"" father answered incorrectly, it was the evil Mulgarath in disguise that wanted to get the book and the ""real"" father was somewhere else at another place and didn't know what was happening. Geez people, pay attention in the storyline, next thing you know, people would think that the goblins were actually based on munchkins. Even though my cousin liked it, after I asked him if he would read the books, now he said that the movie wasn't so great after all compared to the books. For people that didn't read the book, it would be a great and awesome movie. And No, the director of the movie wasn't trying to compete with Harry Potter, or the Chronicles of Narnia. So don't go saying that 'the movie was just trying to be all cool and challenging the almighty Lord of the Rings' or something. Trust me, I've been reading the 1st book in 2002.

But why they had Freddie playing twins is beyond me. The movie could have done without that particular ""magic"" of film editing. Combining the characters could have rounded out the red-headed-step-child-please-beat-me-now brat and made him seem less two-dimensional. Or perhaps they were banking on outing Freddie's outstandingly dross acting talents by giving him a split personality disorder.

They are moving into a creepy old house, which we as a culture know, is a BAD IDEA. Creepy old houses are always a mistake. One of the two twin boys discovers that there are mystical creatures living in and around the house. First off, these two twins are obviously played by the same actor. Were Mary Kate and Ashley not available for the role? Also you could tell the kid playing them was British, because he had a stupid British face and I immediately hated him. Secondly, why is this rural Connecticut town the epicenter of supernatural creatures?? Like, the king of the goblins, most powerful goblin of all (Mulrath) lives in the woods behind an AMC Theater and a family dentistry practice? This is unrealistic. Also the daughter fences, which is not realistic because what kind of a weird freak child takes fencing lessons (THE British?????) Anyway, the evil creatures are looking for this book that contains creature secrets, and the kids have to destroy it to get the creatures off their backs. They break their senile old British aunt out of a sanatorium and she helps them. I stopped paying attention when they started using tomato sauce to kill the goblins.Basically this movie proves that children are big dumb-dumbs, and like very stupid things. Children should never be president and maybe should be kept in caves hidden away until their brains form enough to realize that this movie is stupid. Also I don't trust the British, their accents are annoying and their jokes are bad and their faces are so mushy from years of imperialism.",The Spiderwick Chronicles

It was fairly short (90 minutes) and I felt that the producers made a huge mistake by attempting to cram all five books into one film instead of dividing them into separate features. I had recognized a few of the scenes from the books, but overall it seemed very rushed and excluded many of the series most exciting moments. Any fan of the books would probably be disappointed in the way the series was handled and executed.As for the rest of film, I thought it was well done. The CGI continues to be to focal point in most of these types of family films and the producers spent a great time with its detail and design. The fairies looked neat, the goblins were frightening, and the big bad ogre looked well big and bad.Overall, I would say this film would make for a great matinée on a Sunday with the kids. There are several moments that may scare children under the age of five, but otherwise it should appeal to children of all ages.",The Spiderwick Chronicles
149,waggtime,Did they realize this was a book series?,7,25 February 2008,"My two boys (12 and 9) saw this movie yesterday and honestly, we truly enjoyed it, but to say that it follows the adventures of the Spiderwick book series is a bit of a leap. Actually a huge leap. After the movie my boys and I wondered if Holly and Tony (creators of Spiderwick series) were disappointed in what was created in the Spidewick name. We know that movies cannot follow books completely because of the expenses involved with film making, but the folks who made the Series of Unfortunate Events movie did a nicer job changing the story line to merge the first three books and keep the essence of the story alive. Spiderwick is a fun film, (and yeah, younger viewers will be creeped out, so be cautious about that) but true lovers of the Spiderwick book series will be frustrated by the many, many changes.One more thing... the book series is creepier than the movie. The movie monsters are a bit sillier, more like muppets. In the book they are much scarier.",The Spiderwick Chronicles
