0,Leofwine_draca,A worth successor to the original,7,9 July 2016,"This second sequel to the horror classic doesn't, for once, obey the law of horror sequels, in that it manages to be BETTER than the first sequel. I'm not sure why a lot of people seem to be down on this movie. Maybe because the plot is a lot different from THE EXORCIST but surely any change - or originality - can only be a good thing? It's certainly one of the most expensive-looking and well-made horror movies of the '90s that I've seen, with every scene having that big-budget and crisply realistic gloss that makes it stand out from the crowd. The photography brings to life the atmosphere of the dark sets well and this is a most technically accomplished, polished-looking film.Although most of the action and incident is packed into the second half, this is nonetheless enthralling stuff, with sterling performances from an experienced cast keeping the viewer watching throughout. It does get confusing at times but the main thrust of the plot is easy to follow right through until the ending. One surprising thing about this film is its subtlety. For once the graphic murders are off screen, but their descriptions are enough to make you wince and make your imagination work overtime. It's definitely a case of less is more with this film, which contains some of the most horrible and sick-sounding murders ever.There's plenty of horror here, from physical jumpy shocks (the celebrated hallway murder, in which a white-sheeted figure emerges suddenly from a closed doorway, is brilliant and could show the producers of WHAT LIES BENEATH something) to pieces of sustained tension and the subtle elements of weirdly flickering lights and whispering voices on the soundtrack. The music is suspenseful, the script intelligent for once and not underestimating the intelligence of the viewer.George C. Scott (looking very old but still more than with it) is well-cast as the investigating policeman Kinderman; he makes his character a very human one who is moved to grief on more than one occasion yet still commands the authority and respect that a police lieutenant should. Ed Flanders is very good also in a sympathetic role as a priest, while Nancy Fish retains an air of mystery about her at all times, making her a character to watch when she's on screen (she turns out to be a red herring in the end, though). Also appearing briefly are Nicol Williamson as an exorcist and Jason Miller, who's soul is now trapped inside the body of another man (Miller puts in a frequently upsetting and startling turn). Best of all is the manic Brad Dourif as the Gemini Killer, who is in touch with the underworld. His ranting villain spends all of his screen-time in a padded cell yet, with his words and expression alone, he gives one of the most chilling performances in a long time.The special effects are pretty good, from the ""possessed"" make-up to the standout, unexpected shot of an old lady crawling about on a ceiling - certainly one of the most risky effects shots I've seen, but it pays off superbly. Events climax in a mini-exorcism with lots of special effects which don't disappoint. Blessed with a strong leading man, fine supporting turns, plenty of shocks and scares, and oodles of atmosphere, THE EXORCIST III is a worthy successor to the crown in this humble reviewer's opinion.",The Exorcist III
1,SnoopyStyle,Solid Scott,6,17 October 2018,It's 17 years after the original. This sequel ignores the second movie and is adapted from the subsequent book. Police Lt. Kinderman (George C. Scott) and Father Dyer (Ed Flanders) remember Father Damien Karras every year on the anniversary of his death. Kinderman is investigating a series of killings and blames them on The Gemini Killer despite his presumed death 15 years earlier. Fingerprints point to an old female patient at a psych ward run by Dr. Temple. One patient (Brad Dourif) claims to be possessed by the executed Gemini Killer.George C. Scott is a solid lead. Brad Dourif has the creepiness. It is missing Regan. She's synonymous with the franchise and any sequel needs her character. It functions more or less like the original which does leave it a little behind the times. It's not scary anymore but it does have a little tension. Scott is the key and he's able to carry this all the way to the end.,The Exorcist III
2,gavin6942,Excellent Sequel,7,5 October 2015,"A police lieutenant uncovers more than he bargained for as his investigation of a series of murders, which have all the hallmarks of the deceased 'Gemini' serial killer, lead him to question the patients of a psychiatric ward.Although I actually enjoyed the second ""Exorcist"" film, most people consider it a stinker and like to pretend it never happened. For those people, this is the right film to watch. A great tale of possession, that follows rather directly (though belatedly) from the original.George C. Scott adds a certain weight to any film. Just as he did for ""The Changeling"", he makes what could be a forgettable horror film into something really worthwhile. He is a vastly underrated actor.",The Exorcist III
3,jboothmillard,The Exorcist III,3,23 January 2021,"The Exorcist is an outstanding scary movie, the second film, The Heretic, isn't very good, and the prequel, Exorcist: The Beginning is rubbish. The third film was the last in the franchise I had to see, and I did not high hopes, even being written and directed by William Peter Blatty, the author of the original novel. Basically, set fifteen years after the events after Regan MacNeil's exorcism in Georgetown, Washington D.C., 1975, Father Dyer (Ed Flanders, replacing William O'Malley) and and Lieutenant William F. Kinderman (Razzie nominated George C. Scott, replacing Lee J. Cobb) reminisce about Fr. Damien Karras (Jason Miller). The following night, an incident at a church occurs indicating the presence of an evil supernatural entity. There is later a man walking on the streets speaking of a dream of ""falling down a long flight of steps"", suggesting that someone is committing murders linked to Karras's death. The next morning, Kinderman is called to find the body of young black man Thomas Kintry (James Burgess). The fingerprints at the crime scenes do not match, indicating different people are responsible for each murder. Kinderman reveals to the hospital staff that the murders fit the methods of serial killer James Venamun (Brad Dourif), or ""The Gemini Killer"", who was executed fifteen years ago. Kinderman visits the head of a psychiatric ward, Dr. Temple (Scott Wilson), who relates the history of one of his patients. The patient was found wandering aimlessly fifteen years ago suffering amnesia. He was locked up, catatonic until he became violent and claimed to be the Gemini Killer. Kinderman visits the mental institution and recognises the patient is his old friend Damien Karras. Whilst talking to him, Karras briefly changes physically into the Gemini Killer. He claims to have no knowledge of Karras but boasts about killing Father Dyer. That night, a nurse is murdered, and Dr. Temple commits suicide. Kinderman returns to see Karras, who once again changes into the Gemini Killer. The Gemini explains that he is being aided by a ""Master"", the same demon who had previously possessed Regan MacNeil. The ""Master"" was furious at being exorcised by Karras and is taking revenge by using Karras's body as a vessel for the Gemini to continue his killing spree. Each evening, the soul of the Gemini Killer leaves the body of Karras and possesses other patients in the hospital to commit the murders. The Gemini also reveals he had forced Dr. Temple to bring Kinderman to him. The Gemini possesses an old woman and attempts to murder Kinderman and his family at their home, but Father Paul Morning (Nicol Williamson) abruptly ends the attack, arriving at the hospital to perform an exorcism on Karras. The ""Master"" intervenes, taking over Karras's body, and Morning is severely mutilated. Kinderman rushes back to the hospital and attempts to euthanise Karras. The possessed Karras then torments and attempts to kill Kinderman. But Morning regains consciousness and tells Karras to fight. Karras briefly regains his free will and cries to Kinderman to shoot him. Kinderman kills Karras, freeing him from both the Gemini and his ""Master"". Later, Kinderman watches Karras's funeral; the year on Karras's tombstone reads 1975. Also starring Nancy Fish as Nurse Allerton, George DiCenzo as Stedman, Don Gordon as Ryan, Lee Richardson as University President, Licence to Kill's Grand L. Bush as Sergeant Atkins, Ken Lerner as Dr. Freedman, Colleen Dewhurst as the voice of Satan, and Fabio as an Angel. Scott is okay as the cop, Dourif is alright as the sinister killer character, and Miller's return is inexplicable. The second film actually tried to be scary, but this conclusion to the trilogy is a silly series of chatty sequences, including a lot of Bible-bashing, it really should have tried to be gorier and jumpier, I don't know why the critics give it average ratings, it is a dull and boring horror sequel. Adequate!",The Exorcist III
4,ma-cortes,A cop investigates cruel murders committed by a supernatural killer who has been dead for many years ago,6,20 September 2012,"Effective chiller about a strange possessed murderer that causes creepy goings-on at a mental facility and church . Suspense , mystery , shocks and grisly horror is this classic terror film . It deals with a police lieutenant (George C. Scott) in Georgetown mourns the anniversary of a priest's death as a serial killer strikes ; he bears remarkable resemblance to ¨Gemini Killer¨ , who has been dead for fifteen years . The brutal and gruesome serial killer is at large and carries out a criminal spree . Meanwhile , the Police Inspector is investigating the weird events . And the cop suffering incredible risks trying to unravel mystery of demon living inside a nutty man (Brad Dourif).This is a fairly suspenseful and horrifying story full of thrills , chills , intrigue and supernatural events . The film contains restless terror , gore , blood and usual poltergeists phenomenon and ghastly shenanigans . Top-notch picture , thanks to fine acting , tight pacing, well mounted edition and skillful special effects with magnificent make-up . This is a terrifying and startling story about possession with some moments developed in slow-moving and complex situations . It is produced with acceptable budget by James G. Robinson and Joe Roth , being well recreated with high grade special effects that are frightening and horrifying to spectator . The script is awesome , the acting excellent and the direction by William Peter Blatty plenty of good pace and conviction . This 1990 picture titled ¨The Exorcist III¨ by William Peter Blatty displays a magnificent cast such as George C Scott, Brad Dourif, Ed Flanders , Nicol Williamson and Jason Miller again Father Karras . And a good support cast as Lee Patterson , Viveca Lindfords , Scott Wilson , George DiCenzo , Don Gordon , Harry Carey Jr and uncredited Samuel L. Jackson as a Dream Blind Man . Dark cinematography in sinister and mysterious atmosphere by Gerry Fisher. Frightening and atmospheric musical score by Barry DeVorzon adding Mike Oldfield's soundtrack at main titles . The tale is classified ¨R¨ for graphic violence and profanity but contains gore and guts.The original ¨Exorcist¨ (by William Friedkin) was an excellent flick in which died some actors at the time finished the movie and added a legend about Exorcist's curse . It spawned a wave of demonic possession movies that continues unabated today as ¨Changeling¨ (by Peter Medak), ¨Amytiville ¨(by Stuart Rosemberg) , ¨Darkness¨ (by Jaume Balaguero) are three further examples of this sub-genre . And followed by two sequels and numerous imitations , in 1977 ¨the Heretic¨ by John Boorman with Richard Burton, Linda Blair , deemed awful and this ¨Exorcist 3¨ . Furthermore, spawned two prequels starred by a young Father Merrin (Stellan Skarsgard) : ""Paul Schrader's Exorcist: The Original Prequel"" and ¨Exorcist , The beginning¨ and set in Africa , both of them directed by Paul Schrader and Renny Harlin respectively . Exorcist III is one the highest earning horror picture of the 90s with 6,5 rating . It is a rare film not for squeamish and is better than ¨Beginning¨ , ¨The original sequel¨ and the worst ¨Exorcist II¨ .",The Exorcist III
5,BA_Harrison,The Theatrical Cut.,5,4 February 2018,"One might imagine that, after the debacle that was The Exorcist II, the franchise would have returned to the head-spinning and vomit spewing of the original, but to writer/director William Peter Blatty's credit, he tries something a little different with The Exorcist III, his film's serial killer plotline more akin to The Silence of the Lambs for much of the time. The nearest the film comes to William Friedkin's 1973 classic is with the brief special effects laden exorcism scene in the final act, which was forced upon Blatty by the film's producers.The majority of the film sees George C. Scott's cop Kinderman investigating several gruesome murders that mimic the modus operandi of The Gemini Killer, who was executed in the electric chair fifteen years earlier. Kinderman's enquiries lead him to cell eleven of a secure hospital ward where a patient who resembles dead priest Father Damien Karras claims that he is the Gemini Killer, having possessed Karras's body as he died.Sadly, as original as the majority of this film is, it also proves frustratingly dull for much of the time, with a glut of exposition heavy dialogue, an extremely slow pace, and only one decent scare (the much lauded hospital hallway scene) to keep the viewer from nodding off. As out-of-place as the studio sanctioned exorcism undeniably is, at least it's entertaining, which is more than I can say about George C. Scott's character complaining about a carp in his bath.",The Exorcist III
6,moonspinner55,"Should have been a scary installment...is instead confused, confounding and bungled",3,1 September 2011,"George C. Scott takes over Lee J. Cobb's role from 1973's ""The Exorcist"", playing police detective Bill Kinderman who is still working in Georgetown and mourning the death of his friend, Father Karras; on the 15th anniversary of Karras' death during an attempted exorcism of a demon-possessed child (which, coincidentally, was also the night a serial killer was executed!), grisly murders begin happening in the city that have Kinderman baffled. He should be: the plot threads and causes for these gory deaths make little sense, while Kinderman's questioning of an isolated hospital patient (played, for no explained reason, by both Jason Miller and Brad Dourif) tries and fails to inject an exorcism-scenario akin to the first film onto a detective-story narrative. Writer-director William Peter Blatty based the screenplay on his novel ""Legion"", and while he has a good ear for joshing conversations and b.s. humor, he goes way overboard on the nasty intricacies of a demonic slaying. There also seems to have been some confusion in filming the last portion of the story, as Kinderman converses with mental patients and one highly-strung nurse but is never shown putting the pieces of this puzzle together. Initially, Blatty prods our memories of ""The Exorcist"" amusingly, but soon finds himself exploiting that plot with useless references to the characters and with the casting of Miller (an idea that just doesn't pan out). Scott is terrific as Kinderman and actually gives these metaphysical ramblings some weight; however, Blatty has no sympathy for his gaggle of victims and winds up exploiting himself. *1/2 from ****",The Exorcist III
7,Quinoa1984,Among the most fascinating and bizarre sequels of modern Hollywood,8,13 October 2019,"This is so... So... Uncanny. For a number of reasons.First off, maybe George C Scott protested his Oscar win for Patton because he could see into the future and thought he really deserved it for the scene in Exorcist III where he talks about having to look at the carp fish from his wife in his bathtub(?) One can dream.I should note seriously that he is quite good here, being what should be the closest thing to an audience avatar (which, in this case with Blatty, means not entirely so much) as he is investigating these twisted murders by a serial killer called ""Gemin"" - who everyone thinks died 15 years before, when that little McNeil exorcism thing happened - just as Father Damien Karras did... Except the killer's real M.O., kept out of the press, keeps appearing with these victims, including a 12 year old and some priests. Scott manages to coney a lot of frustration and pain and anguish, at times subdued and other times not at all in that BIG Scott performance way, and he is something that, if only somewhat, can keep us tethered to some sort of reality (carp and all).I think an issue in this film is that Blatty never got the memo from David Fincher when he said his line about people thinking there's five ways to shoot and scene, but in reality there's actually two, and one of those is wrong. And while Blatty made this before Fincher said that, the main idea applies: Blatty shoots scenes, not all the time but enough I could notice, in ways that say he either doesn't know where to put the camera just right or doesn't care or is just experimenting because he thinks the material calls for close-ups HERE when it should be a wide or medium. This also goes for the pacing at times, where a character will-in on a previous scene with a line or it's a hard CUT to something else. But this is in scenes establishing characters and the stakes in the first act for the most part, and it creates this weird feeling that Blatty may or may not have intended. It sure kept me on my toes (it's a movie to put the phone down and just WATCH), and even the direction of certain supporting players (like that one nurse that *yells* her dialog for some reason) is also off-kilter.That's the phrase to look for here is off-kilter, which would be fine if this wasn't meant to be a sequel (of sorts, or spin-off or follow-up, whatever you want to call it) to The Exorcist, and despite the studio monkeying around with Blatty and forcing the title and franchise on him (though the book, Legion, does follow Kinderman and is in this world), Blatty is sort of defying the stark/documentary type of realism that was set up in the first story, which made it so horrifying, and since he is a true believer in this stuff (Friedkin, who wasn't, brought a different take on it), that also makes it... Odder.Like, is the conflict that Kinderman isn't a believer and has to become one to stop this possessed killer, who happens to take on the face sometimes of Karras (Miller returning... for half of a performance, allegedly due to his drinking problem he couldn't remember all the lines to Blatty's turducken-sized monologues for Vinamen) Or is it simply a mystery with a particularly twisted horror bent that includes some gory details?So what elevates what is a bit of a mess of a horror mystery, even before it gets to the climax - where the studio spent 4 million because they ordered that Blatty had to make it a full-blown Exorcist movie for several minutes? The scenes with Miller and Dourif in that dark mental hospital cell are masterful and remarkable, tense and even terrifying for how effectively Blatty is shooting and cutting together, the lighting and staging, what are long dialog/monologue scenes, the cracklingly good performances from these two men who tap into not just the evil but the misery and diabolical thrill of beong evil, and that for as long-winded as it might seem (particularly the second round, the first scene, where it's almost 50/50 Miller and Dourif, is aces)... It finds its footing and feels unique in that way where it can get under our skin. A good ten minutes of this is as unique and brilliant as any great horror movie ever.There are a few other moments of creative filmmaking too, like that long sustained take showing the nurse doing her work in the hallway that leads up to a OH HELL moment, and a chase and confrontation in Kinderman's house that has energy and terror, and also that surreal (if short) sequence in the heaven waiting room, featuring the scariest jazz ever.I cant say Exorcist III is particularly great, but watching it now almost 30 years later there's a lot to admire about it too. I even admire the warped go for broke level of horror of that finale (I do intend some day to watch Legion the director's cut). It's not the sort of movie most of us would expect from a movie called Exorcist III, but it has a closer look and tone than (certainly) Exorcist II. And if it is at times Cinema-by-Committee, then at least that wild almost amateur but creative novelist Blatty got to flex a little.",The Exorcist III
8,Coventry,"The best in the series! Yes, BETTER than the almighty original!",9,26 December 2004,"I took the opportunity to re-watch all three Exorcist films in one weekend in order to make the most accurate comparison possible. Let me come straight to the point.I doubt many people will agree with me but I think this is the BEST in the series. I've seen the Exorcist quite a few times by now (including the director's cut or the so-called ""version you've never seen"") but not once did I feel like I was watching a true masterpiece (hey, at least The Exorcist kept me fascinated throughout its entire playtime. I really had to struggle my way through the lousy sequel ""The Heretic"" and that one might easily be the most redundant film ever made) . Yes, I also regard The Exorcist as an essential movie and one of the few films that co-formed the horror genre but I definitely think it's overrated and the reasons why I prefer ""Legion"" are simple and as following:1. The 1973 original too much depends on only A FEW powerful and mesmerizing sequences instead of a being a coherent wholesome. The sequences showing young possessed Regan are fascinating but the rest is uninteresting talking. Now, Legion mainly is talking as well but  I don't know  it's a lot more involving. How many people among you really cared about father Karras' mother dying in the original? Or the torn familial situation of mother/actress Chris Mac Neil? Or the archaeological findings of Father Merrin in Iraq? Well, I sure don't.Legion, on the contrary, handled about a pitch-black matter. The return of a feared and inhuman serial killer blend with elements of religion, supernatural events and deep anti-social behavior. 2. Let's face it(dramatization) The Exorcist is nothing but an expanded Catholic treatise, giving us insights about what ""the Church"" considers to be evil. Aside from very intelligent use of technical eeriness, The Exorcist is definitely not the scariest movie of all time, not even the best tale handling about ""religious evil"" (check out ""The Omen"" for that). Let's just say it is fundamental viewing in case the horror genre fascinates you. Even though Legion obviously depends on its religious background as well, I get the feeling that the Catholicism isn't shoved down your throat here. William Peter Blatty clearly hasn't lost his obsession for religion since he wrote his notorious novel ""The Exorcist"" but at least I Dion't feel the necessity to pray for salvation this time, after seeing Legion. Anyway, onwards with my more specified thoughts on Exorcist chapter III: Legion. Okay, I admitI'm a sucker for serial killer portraits and seeing I was already familiar with the real-life murderer ""The Zodiac"" this story fascinated me from the first minute right till the last. To a sick and twisted mind like me, this is just a perfect film: heavy, devastating monologues about barbaric modus operandi and endless expeditions into the darkest chambers of the (in)human mind. With the right actors in the protagonists' roles (as it is the case here) a film like this becomes a modest masterpiece in my eyes. George C. Scott is excellent in roles where he plays a skeptic and exhausted lonely man (please check out titles like ""The Changeling"" and ""Hardcore"" to state this opinion further) but the real power here comes from the always-amazing Brad Douriff. The way he monotonously and straight-facing-camera talks about murdering human beings (even downright glorifying it as pure art) gives an entire new meaning to the word 'terror'. The film's plot is as compelling as it is complex. Fifteen years after the infamous exorcism of young Regan MacNeil, which cost the life to father Damien Karras, his old friend Lt. Kinderman faces a series of murders with a Catholic tan. The killer's trademarks strangely resemble those of the Gemini Killer, only he also died fifteen years earlierin the electric chair. Deep down the cellars of Georgetown's mental asylum (if you can call it that) someone claims recognition for the murders. When Kinderman goes to interrogate him, he's severely shocked to see the man is father Karras. ""Legion"" is a nearly brilliant wholesome of frights and shocksbut not in the least how you're used to witnessing them. With the excessive use of ""vocal violence"" and a unique use of building up tension, implementing cheap gore 'n guts would only ruin a story like this. Even more than the legendary 1973 original, this film relies on the truly chilling power of suggestion!! Even though I like my portion of gore as much as the next horror fan, I thought this is a better film without gruesome scenes. Even the explicit climax is unnecessarily and quite a misfit considering the tone used throughout the whole movie. Yet, it's the only sequence featuring actual ""gore"". William Peter Blatty is a very professional director in my book and one who clearly upholds his goals and ambitions. Even thought the producers somewhat forced him to make this sequel more accessible to the fans of the original Exorcist, he still manages mark this film with his own style and ambitions. The haunting atmosphere is brought to an even higher level thanks to the sublime use of ultra-eerie set pieces and chilling imagery. In conclusion: I love this film!! And you should, too  I think it describes itself best as a film that makes your blood pump faster to your heart AND it stimulates your brain activity at the same! That's a rare and unique combination that every horror fanatic should admire.",The Exorcist III
9,Theo Robertson,The Wisecracks And In-jokes Were The Reason It Was Written,5,2 November 2005,"Writer/director William Peter Blatty the original novel on which the original THE EXORCIST was based ( He also adapted his own novel into an Oscar winning screenplay ) but despite the references to Father Karras etc and no point does this movie feel like it was ever written as a sequel the original 1973 horror comedy ( It made me laugh out loud ! ) but since this also has some amusing moments at least Blatty is consistent The movie does have a plot , that of Lt Bill Kinderman finding out that a serial killer is using the method of operation of a dead serial killer from 15 years earlier but Blatty concerns himself less with plot and more on one liners like Lt Bill telling a deluded woman that he's a TV repairman and the woman replying that she's not holding an imaginary television but an imaginary phone ! or the in-joke of one of the priests saying his favourite film is THE FLY ( Look up the trivia section ) , or the classic camp scene of LT Bill talking to murder victims in Heaven What did someone say these scenes weren't meant to be funny ? Again I can only go on what instinct caused me to think . Certainly this might have started off as a serious supernatural thriller but all through the film you are left with the distinct impression that Blatty is getting extremely bored with things so resorts to introducing laughable concepts like chain smoking hospital patients etc . You also get the feeling that if this had been made a couple of years later this would have been a dark thriller devoid of any supernatural elements to tie in with Hollywoods obsession with serial killer thrillers after the mind blowing success of SILENCE OF THE LAMBS If you thought THE EXORCIST was terrifying ( I'd surprised how many people did ) then you'll probably find this dubious sequel disappointing . My own opinion is that it's watchable but that's probably down to it being a very camp film",The Exorcist III
10,poolandrews,Dull supernatural thriller with tenuous links to the original Exorcist.,5,9 November 2005,"The Exorcist III starts in 'Georgetown 1990' with Lieutenant William Kinderman (George C. Scott) & his close friend Father Joseph Dyer (Ed Flanders) conducting a annual ritual in which they go to the cinema to watch 'It's A Wonderful Life' in memory of their friend Father Damien Karras (Jason Miller) who died when he fell down a flight of steps 15 years ago... Afterwards Kinderman confides in Dyer over his latest case where a young black boy named Thomas Kintry (James Burgess) was murdered, decapitated & his head replaced by a head of Christ from a statue. Shortly after another murder with strong religious overtones happens, this time the victim is Father Kanavan (Harry Carey Jr.) & around this time Father Dyer is admitted to hospital where he becomes the next victim of this sadistic serial killer who has exactly the M.O. as someone dubbed the 'Gemini Killer' 15 years ago when very similar crimes were committed. Is it a copycat killer? Or does it have something to do with the mysterious James Venamun (Brad Dourif) who currently resides in a padded cell but seems to be possessed by something evil...A box-office flop when released The Exorcist III was written & directed by William Peter Blatty based on his novel called 'Legion' I personally thought it was rather dull & didn't do much for me at all. The script goes for psychological horror rather than visual, The Exorcist III is more police thriller than straight horror with most of the running time consumed by Kinderman's investigations into various murders before the climax where a few horror elements kick in particularly the exorcism which felt out of place when put beside the rest of the film. I found the character's bland & forgettable, the film has a slow pace & I found myself rapidly losing interest in the whole thing despite being a huge horror fan & liking The Exorcist (1973). Put as simply as I can I was bored & it just didn't grip or engage me whatsoever although having said that as a thriller it was OK. The horror is very subtle & apart from the climax there is barely a drop of blood in the entire thing as The Exorcist III tries to shock you with it's dialogue driven descriptions of the murders. I didn't even like when Kinderman & the 'Gemini Killer' met each other & talked. Technically The Exorcist III is alright although the cinematography got on my nerves as director Blatty likes to keep his camera as still as he can & insert lots of random scene setting objects into sequences which really slow the film down. The locations & sets are OK with nice detail & overall it's well made with that Hollywood polish to it. The acting was OK but I didn't particularly like or feel for anyone & Scott as Kinderman started to become irritating to me well before the end. I really didn't think too much of The Exorcist III, it just bored me plain & simple. It seems to get good reviews & I'm sure there are people out there who will appreciate & enjoy The Exorcist III more than I did. A bit of a bore as far as I'm concerned I'm afraid.",The Exorcist III
11,utgard14,"My God, the Grammar",7,6 January 2014,"Police lieutenant William Kinderman (George C.

William Peter Blatty directed and wrote this based on his novel ""Legion."" It's famous for having been tampered with in post-production by a studio that wanted more of a typical schlocky horror film than a supernatural detective story. Given this, it's amazing Exorcist III turned out as good as it did. It's certainly light years better than Part 2, which is widely considered one of the worst films of all time. It does have flaws and it won't please everybody. It's certainly not in the same league as the original Exorcist.

12,view_and_review,Back On Track,6,21 March 2020,"""The Exorcist III"" is one of those rare third parts of a franchise that gets the franchise back on track. ""The Exorcist II"" was so bad they left the whole thing alone for 13 years. Part three harkens back to its roots. Once again we're dealing with possession and the need for an exorcism.Unlike the previous two episodes, now there are murders and gruesome ones at that. Detective Kinderman (George C. Scott) can't figure out who's committing these murders they are so clean. HIs investigation is concentrated on a hospital after his friend Father Morning (Nicol Williamson) is butchered there. All the signs are pointing toward a demonic force at play, but Kinderman is not a believer.As I said, part three got back in touch with its essence. They brought back the eeriness, spookiness, and chilliness that made it the model possession movie.",The Exorcist III
13,kannibalcorpsegrinder,Extremely overrated and boring slog,5,27 February 2018,"When a series of brutal killings rock a small town, the local police detective finds that they resemble a supposedly long-dead serial killer's work and finds the truth behind the deaths to be done by a possessed madman, forcing him to stop the deadly rampage before it's too late.This is a rather surprisingly good film with a few flaws. One of the more engaging elements to this one is the fact that it goes for a more subdued series of scare tactics which is well appreciated. The main angle of the series of gruesome deaths that takes up the majority of the first half which is basically taken up with discussions about the graphic murders being committed around the city or conducting their investigative tactics trying to tie it into the events in the past storyline. They help with a powerful tone that is really unsettling and manages to get the best out of very little. The storyline is quite brilliant, leaving very little in the way of confusion and the way it is able to connect with the original and take off where it left is a fantastic feat. The other really enjoyable aspect of this one is the series of fine jumpscares that are present here to help break up the monotony. The dream sequence moving through Heaven as a large Grand Central Station where he finds an old friend with his head stitched on who turns and utters a shocking line holds a strong kick, the moment where a character enters a hospital ward and one of the patients is scuttling about on the ceiling behind them is a real jump and the nurse jump is among one of the finest shocks ever committed to the screen. These here make this one engaging as there's very little to find fault within this one. There are a couple things that come to mind with this one. One big issue is the fact that the ending is so out-of-place and over-the-top that it borders on the ludicrous in what it tries to pull off. Not only does it really ruin what could've been a brilliant movie, but it does little to stave off what was the inevitable by being so tonally off from what had come before it. However, the other thing that really bothers is that the pace of the film is a real slog to get through. Very rarely does this one have anything happen as the film doesn't really need to be sped up and make things go quicker since the film does take its time in spelling things out as the investigations that take up the main part of the film don't really offer this one any kind of horror-based activity. It's the biggest problem that affects this one.Rated R: Graphic Language and Graphic Violence.",The Exorcist III
14,FlashCallahan,Catatonic are so easy to possess.....,7,16 November 2013,"Lt. Kinderman and Father Dyer meet up on the anniversary of the death of their mutual friend, Father Damien Karras, by going to see ""It's a Wonderful Life"" at the local cinema. But there's no cheering Kinderman while a particularly cruel and gruesome serial killer is at large. His murders, which involve torture, decapitation and the desecration of religious icons, resemble those of the Gemini Killer, who has been dead for fifteen years....Ignoring the events of Boormans brilliantly barking mad, but awful sequel, this is Blattys movie from his own book, Legion. And while it's not a patch on the original, which is the greatest horror movie ever made, its a pretty good movie.If you haven't seen the original, then it won't make any sense to you, let alone the emotion that comes to the screen, when we are reunited with Jason Miller.George C Scott looks bewildered half of the time, and the most intense scenes are in the cell, but there are some really good scenes, and in my opinion, this film features one of the best scares in a movie. Ever.Dourif steals the movie as Patient X, and it's visually stunning in some scenes, but the studio ruined the end of the movie, by 'having' to have an Exorcism in there.All in all, its a good movie, nothing groundbreaking, but fun while it lasts.",The Exorcist III
15,The_Void,A lame sequel to a masterpiece,7,25 November 2004,"The Exorcist is an absolute classic, The Exorcist III, however; most certainly is not. William Peter Blatty, the author of the original novel, this time takes the directors chair, and in doing so proves that someone directing their own work doesn't necessarily make for a better film than if they had gotten someone else to do it. This film follows on from the original by following the fates of two of the surviving central characters; Lieutenant William Kinderman and Father Damien Karras. After a series of brutal murders, Lieutenant Kinderman sees a similarity with another series of brutal murders that happened fifteen years ago, collectively known as the 'Gemini murders' due to the killer's modus operandi, that included a symbol of the star sign 'Gemini' being carved on one of the victim's palms. These murders also seem to be somehow linked with an exorcism performed fifteen years earlier.The main problem with this film is the murders. The film delights in explaining all kinds of horrible ways to go in very graphic detail, but it never delights us by showing any of them, which, being a gorehound, annoyed me no end. It's like a smoker having a cigarette and no lighter; why does Blatty torture me like this?! Blatty, perhaps realising how mean he's been throughout the film, does show some guts in the final ten minutes by way of a lovely sequence that sees a priest stuck to the ceiling; but I'm afraid it's too little too late. This idea of describing the murders without showing them (or just showing us the aftermath) does have it's plus points; not many, but a few. One of which is the conversations that Kinderman has with the Gemini Killer, which show the killer describing his 'art' with great glee. These scenes are genuinely creepy, and by far the film's best moments...but again, a little viewing of what he's describing isn't too much to ask...is it?While The Exorcist presented itself as a serious piece of art, despite much unpleasantness; this third installment doesn't seem to be bothered about doing that. In doing so, it has caught the worst of both worlds. The Exorcist III doesn't come across as being a serious film, and it doesn't have much to please the gorehounds either. The characters in the first film were very real through excellent acting from all concerned; but here it's very hammy. George C. Scott is a good actor, and his performance in this film isn't too bad on the whole; but it is over the top at times, and at other times he looks bored (probably with the lackluster material he's working with). Brad Dourif, a man who is no stranger to campy horror films made around the time this was made plays the Gemini Killer, and his performance is the hammiest of the movie. As I mentioned earlier, the parts where he describes his 'art' are creepy due to the writing; but his deliverance is neither malevolent not realistic. In David Fincher's Seven, Kevin Spacey played a similar character to Dourif's here, but he was able to make it malevolent and real by way of some toned down acting; Dourif just looks silly. The rest of the cast isn't in it enough to really make an impression, with the exception of Jason Miller who reprises his role from the first film...and doesn't really impress with it either.The Exorcist III fails on everything that the original thrived on. Through hammy performances, a dull plot and an ill-advised 'less is more' attitude, William Peter Blatty has made a lame sequel to a masterpiece. The original film is one that stays with you and is not easy to forget; Part III is as forgettable as they come. Although not a complete waste of time, this film cannot be described as 'good' and I can only recommend staying clear. Go and watch the original again is my advice.",The Exorcist III
16,HumanoidOfFlesh,"Very boring,but not bad.",7,15 May 2001,"In my opinion ""Exorcist 3"" is definitely better than really awful ""Exorcist 2:The Heretic"",but worse than the original.It's true that director William Peter Blatty doesn't rely on blood and gore;instead of he creates an unforgettable atmosphere of dread and fear.Some scenes like the confessional sequence are indeed really creepy.Unfortunately ""Exorcist 3"" is relentlessly talky and dull in places and not really that scary,mainly because I've seen much more scarier flicks like ""Suspiria"" or even Zulawski's ""Possession"".I didn't find it disturbing-if you want to see something totally mind-shattering try to find ""Cannibal Holocaust"".Overall I was a little bit disappointed with this one-I expected a creepy masterpiece and finally I've got pretty scary,but also deadly dull horror film.So if you are ""The Exorcist"" fan then this one is a must-see,if not avoid it.My rating:7/10.",The Exorcist III

I went out and rented it. I watched the whole thing. And I was soooooooooooooo bored. When they brought back Karras, why didn't they think of something more original? This movie really sucked. I'd rather watch the second one. Because at least they have a better plot. Then they brought back someone who is supposed to be DEAD! Karras died!!! He's not supposed to be on the Earth.

However this 1990 film ""The Exorcist III"" goes well in step with the classic original almost like a continuation story of evil and possession with past connections. Based on a 1983 novel from William Peter Blatty called ""Legion"" this story and film is a scary and creepy fright feast that proves evil does exist in the world that we live in perhaps in the form of bad spirits and the afterlife. The film paces the scenes well the build up of the scenes are often slow yet end with very tense endings and bloody murders.Set in Washington D.C. in the town of Georgetown a series of strange and bizarre murders start to happen and the killings are gruesome and they involve decapitations and mock style executions which rivals that of ""Jesus being nailed to the cross"". Enter Lt. Kinderman(the great George C. Scott) who's weathered worn burned out tough as nails detail detective soon starts to find that the murders are related to and rival that of the Gemini killer(an executed killer). Also the story and cases tie into a university hospital psych ward. Plus their is a scene in the hallway of a Nurses station that is freakish it may just be one of the scariest in horror film history.Interesting is seeing how Patient X and a past form of Father Karras ties into the murders, also the performance from Brad Dourif is scary and spooky as the Gemini Killer. The acting and cast chemistry is all pro plus the scenes filmed were paced well and the camera work helped make the movie a knockout as many scary and tense moments have a slow build up only to surprise with quick and unexpected terror and fear! Finally watch this good well done sequel from 1990 and yes it was indeed scary proving that evil exist and is present in many forms thru people and their spirits, and for more insight read Blatty's complex novel ""Legion"".",The Exorcist III

He mysteriously beings a reign of terror, and a police lieutenant tries desperately to solve the murders and crack the mystery.This is quite a good piece of horror cinema with a lot of tension and thrills, from the doom and gloom atmosphere surrounding the downtrodden, murders, and rage to the demon action. The latter, though, was limited throughout the movie. Much of the film is about solving the crimes, in a gloomy-type atmosphere that makes this movie look like a film-noir type setting.There's some good and intense acting and some devilish frightening scenes, including the ""creature-in-the-white-robe"" scene.

It's so much better that calling it simply an ""Exorcist"" sequel doesn't do it justice. Unlike the extravagant original, it depends mostly on the power of talk and suggestion to build its creepy atmosphere. It's the first time in this series that the characters come across as genuine human beings; there is even a welcome amount of humor. Compelling performances by George C. Scott and Brad Dourif.

21,sol1218,The Ultimate Evil,7,10 March 2005,"***SPOILERS*** A number of brutal and ritualistic-type murders that have taken place in Georgetown has police Let. Bill Kinderman, George C. Scott, deeply concerned. Let. Kindeman was in charge of the ""Gemini Killer"" serial murder case that happened fifteen years ago and the MO of these killings are identical to that of that long ago killer.The fact that the murder victims now, a 12 years-old boy and two Catholic priests, were killed exactly the same way as those victims of the ""Gemini Killer"" were back then. The method of his savage actions was never reviled to the newspapers and the public yet these killings could not have possibly been done by him since the ""Gemini Killer"" was executed back in 1973, or was he? Worthy follow-up to the original movie ""The Exorcist"" if you throw out the ridicules ""The Exorcist Part II: The Heretic"" made some thirteen years earlier. William Peter Blatty's ""Exorcist III"" starts where ""The Exorcist"" left off when the heroic Father Karras, Jason Miller,fell down a long flight of stairs outside the MacNeil residents taking the demon who was in possession of young Regan MacNeil's body with him to his death. At that very moment the convicted ""Geemini Killer"" James Venamun, Brad Dourif, was executed for his crimes. The Devil took advantage of this moment in time by transferring the soul of Venamun into the dead Father Karras' body and at the same time bring Karras back to life. Wondering around the streets of Georgetown the now unrecognizable and comatose Father Karras was taken into a local mental institution where he spent the last fifteen years, strapped down in a padded cell, and known to those in charge only as patient X. As time went by Karras' mental facilities slowly came back to him and with Venamun in control of his body and, this is hard to take, soul has been using the mental patients to do his bloody work. Manipulating their, crippled and very impressionable, minds the patients go out in the neighborhood as well as in the hospital and commit this latest string of ""Gemini "" killings. ""Exorcist III"" has a lot of dream-like and surrealistic scenes in it which at times confuses you. As it moves to it final conclusion, in the graphic battle between ""Good"" and ""Evil"", it becomes very clear to what it's been telling you for the first 90 minutes or so. ""The Devil"" through the helpless Father Karras, whom he brought back from the dead, is waging his war against ""Good"" with one of those saintly men who stood fought and died for it.George C. Scott gives his usual top-rate performance as the troubled and gilt-ridden, he felt that he should have saved Father Karras back in 1973, police Let. Kinderman. At first Let. Kinderman didn't really understand what he was up against, the Devil. When he finally did, at the end of the movie, he not only cast the Devil's demons out of the tragic priest but put Karras tortured soul to rest and peace forever, in a truly shocking and memorable final sequence.Both Brad Dourif & Jason Miller were just as good as Scott as the ""Gemini Killer"" James Venamun and Father Karras who both occupied the same, Karras', body. Like in a titanic tug of war Venamun and Father Karras were in conflict with each other throughout the entire movie. Until the evil, that was engineered by the Devil, on the people of Georgetown and the Catholic Church was finally put to an end.",The Exorcist III
22,lost-in-limbo,"""It's a wonder life"".",8,16 October 2011,"In some ways I vastly think this second sequel is a vast improvement over William Friedkin's original film (even though many might think I'm mad for stating that), where it has the original's author William Peter Blatty writing the screenplay, but also directing the feature. Very different in style and totally ignores the abysmal first sequel, where this entry does continue on from the first film with characters returning, like Lieutenant Kinderman, Father Dyer and Father Karras with Jason Millar reprising the role. Kinderman is played respectfully by George C. Scott in what is a tour de force performance. His witty exchanges with Ed Flander's character Father Dyer and the hospital cell confrontations with Brad Dourif's psychotic serial killer character were definitely a highlight. Also its thick on dark atmospherics, with a lingering uneasiness and it has one of the most chilling set-pieces that simply make you jump. What we get is Blatty's vision, which is adapted of his novel ""Legion"". Quite story driven, where it relies on its wordy script (sometimes over-explaining details) and brooding moodiness as this investigation becomes a graphic, if silly standoff between good and evil. It's less showy in its set pieces, but still it provides its moments of shocks and surreal imagery (like the dream sequences), but for most part it's a gripping psychological mystery teaser that only goes for cheap frights and special effects in its possessed fright-fest finale. The rest of the cast aim up rather well; Nicol Williamson, Scott Wilson, Nancy Fish, Grand L. Bush and Ken Learner.""Nothing is normal about that man.""",The Exorcist III
23,paul2001sw-1,Superior sequel,7,5 November 2005,"With a title like 'Excorcist 3', one doesn't hope for much. But in fact, this film is really only so titled to exploit the value attached with the name, and although it was written (and also directed) by the writer of the original film, it's actually a stand-alone movie in it's own right. And while William Blatty may be hard pushed to rival the efforts of the original's director, William Friedkin, he doesn't do too bad a job: he's a little over-reliant on abrupt cutting to achieve his shocks, and the budget for the special effects was obviously inadequate, but this is a suspenseful and chilling thriller. All supernatural movies suffer from a degree of innate silliness, and satanic movies perhaps especially so, but this film is constructed as if it was a conventional serial killer thriller, albeit an exceptionally dark and creepy one. As the signs of actual devilry begin to increase, the detective leading the case (played brilliantly by George Scott) starts to wonder if he's going mad. Only when the film is forced, near its conclusion, to represent the nightmare literally, does it inevitably become a little daft (but that charge could even be levied at 'The Excorcist' itself). I'm not generally a huge fan of horror movies, but this one is definitely above average, for its skill in modulating the tension and in restraining from excess until its final scenes. In conclusion, ignore the title, and watch.",The Exorcist III
24,ericstevenson,I enjoyed it,7,9 May 2018,"This has little connection to the first two Exorcist films although the death of the priest is alluded to and an important plot point. I admit to not remembering any of the characters from the original except for Regan and the demon. This still does a much better job of being faithful to the original film than the second movie did. This was nowhere near as violent as the original, but still quite creepy. I admit to being confused by the tone of this film at first. It played more like a murder mystery most of the time.It definitely gets better when we see the man claiming to be the Gemini Killer. I'd compare it to ""The Silence Of The Lambs"" but that movie had yet to come out. Maybe this was instead inspired by the novel it was based on? I really like seeing all the religious imagery and religious talk. The length is quite nice, but it does take awhile to really get good. It's still one of the biggest improvements in a sequel if only because ""The Exorcist II: The Heretic"" was so bad. ***",The Exorcist III

Once in a while in the film the great actor George C. Scott is funny. Brad Dourif puts on a fantastic performance that in MY opinion was oscar worthy.

28,filipemanuelneto,An insufficient effort.,2,14 February 2017,"After the disaster of ""The Exorcist 2"", it seems that William Peter Blatty, writer of the novel that originated the first film, decided to defend his creation and to direct this sequel himself, under a script written by himself, adapting another of his novels. So, its almost a work of just one person. It revolves around a mysterious murderer wanted by the police. However, the plot lost itself and, from the middle, is absolutely confusing, annoying and makes the public sleep more quickly than a sleeping pill. We simply don't understand what we're watching anymore. Decidedly, Blatty does not have talent for director, much less for writer. Jason Miller makes a brief cameo but its very empty of meaning and is not enough to establish a link with previous films, of which it inherits little more than the title. Thus, this attempt of sequel ends up very lost and disconnected of the previous films, thanks to an incompetent script and an absent direction.",The Exorcist III

I really liked the way he performed as a serial killer but also a demon possessed man with a clever mind. The dialogues between Lt. Kinderman and The Gemini Killer are simply great, excellent.This movie relies more on the information side than on the visuals. I really liked how the movie creates Horror by description of horrible situations that are in fact, important for the movie. You need to pay attention closely to every line in this movie because it helps you understand the perfect ending.The visuals are extremely good. There's good gore, excellent make-up and some bone chilling scenes involving a catatonic possessed old lady crawling like a spider, and a diabolical nun that takes the audience by surprise in one of the most chilling scenes in recent Horror.The direction is perfect. The darkness of the plot makes this an unsettling movie with a creepy atmosphere. This is the real sequel to the original masterpiece.Watch ""Exorcist III"" if you like smart, scary Horror movies.

I HATED 2, and it is not relevant in any way to the story line of 1 and 3.I liked the cinematography; I liked the way the whole movie was shot.It was set up from all perspectives and edited together in a very creative way such as to give you the first person view at times, as well as the voyeur view from which most directors use.I liked how fully it explained what happened to Karras, and why. I loved how it went back and forth from the Gemini Killer to Karras, to demonstrate the power of the demon which possessed the Gemini to begin with.I liked the edge of your seat moments throughout this film. The ""scares"" were psychological ones, on a level with which most of us could identify.I liked that they used George C. Scott as the detective. In this role, he was rudimental to the success of this film.I liked that they used the same Karras.I liked the originality and creativity in the plot, such as the catatonics crawling about the ceilings, the symbolism used throughout the movie, the metaphors and side shots, etc.I liked that they worked on the plot and dialog and made the Gemini Killer's demon a truly evil persona and not merely ""bad."" The things I did NOT like The exorcism itself seemed completely out of context with the story line. It was like they said, ""Oh yeah! Let's do an exorcism!"" as an afterthought to the main plot. It was almost as if the movie itself was over, but the actors kept on going in an ad-lib and they just kept filming. It was well done, but its timing was far too fortuitous for Scott's character, in my opinion.Secondly, I do not like the religious brow-beating we get in these ""possession"" movies. There are things in the shadow realms which are not of Christianity, which possess. Why don't they ever make a movie about THAT? Honestly, those were the only things I did not like about this movie, and the second is with the sub-genre in general and not this movie in particular.I found it to be an honest attempt and a successful sequel. I can't say it was better than the original, as the original was a well-told story in its own right.

31,Captain_Couth,Legion: Exorcist III,7,26 October 2004,"Exorcist III (1990) was the follow up to the classic Exorcist. Despite the number three next to the title, this was the true sequel to the first film. Writer/ Director William Peter Blatty wanted to simply call the movie ""Legion"" like the name of his novel. But the producers wanted to cash in on the Exorcist name so he caved into pressure. In Europe it's called Legion: Exorcist III. This wasn't going to be the first or the last conflict Blatty would have with the producers. The novel was a straight forward mystery/ thriller. The producer wanted some gore and ""exorcism"" thrown into the mix. Blatty wanted to make an atmospheric horror film, the producers wanted a prototypical 80's horror film. The producers wanted Jason Miller and an exorcism! Who won out?The film follows the friendship between Father Dyer and Detective Kinderman. Meanwhile a serial killer is running around Georgetown gruesomely murdering the city's residents. Kinderman is called into duty and is puzzled by the brutal slayings. That is until he follows the clues and they lead him to a very unlikely place. Kinderman's faith in man is tested as he continues on through out this bizarre and seemingly never ending case.George C. Scott is excellent as Kinderman. he plays the role of the detective as if he was tailored made for the part. Ed Flanders co-stars as Father Dyer. Nicol Williamson has a guest star spot as a Father Merrin type priest (his scenes seemed to have been added during post production because they don't fit in with the rest of the movie). The ending felt rushed and it has ""post production"" stamped on it. Word has it that the film was indeed tampered with during the post production. I think so to because the book's ending was far different than what was put out on the silver screen.Is the movie worth watching? Yes it is because it's a worthy follow up to the Exorcist. Even though it was fiddled around with during the final phase of production, scenes seem to have been added and the ever presence of the producers looking over the director's shoulder, it's still a great film. I'm probably one of the few people who are actually satisfied with the movie. I wished Blatty could have the original version of this film restored.

Scott is fabulous as Kinderman - full of wit, world weary experience and shock at what is happening around him. The supporting cast are spot on with Flanders touching and funny as Kinderman's best mate, Wilson dead weird and convincing as the psychiatrist and Fish as the tough nurse. In addition Dourif gives a barn storming, scenery chewing but disturbing turn as the man in the asylum.There are a considerable number of spooky set pieces including one of the all time great jump scares made with skilful direction and timing.What drops this out of a list of the greatest horror films is a really daft dream sequence where Scott talks to various victims, the special effects laden climax and the diverting and pretty meaningless Nicol Williamson section.A fine film overall though.",The Exorcist III

SCOTT.Now i had only ever seen the great veteran actor Scott in the scary, gritty & sad 70's Thriller "" HardCore"" & his performance in that seedy Thriller as a disturbed religious father lost in the grimy underworld of the Los Angeles porno scene trying to find his daughter was outstanding in my opinion. George was a brilliant actor that's a fact & made an impression on me in that creepy Thriller.Here the great actor plays a bitter & angry Detective (another incredible performance) who is haunted by what he deals with everyday as a Cop. There's a sicko sadistic serial killer on the rampage & the deaths are horrific & symbolic with religious themes & the stress of these disturbing murders are getting too much for our hero Detective. Lieutenant Kinderman is a great character to follow on this dark & twisted demonic Mystery as he's an old guy that's full of Rage at a world that is so cruel. I really identified with Scott's character here & incredibly intense performance. Scott brings lots of intensity to the role & a hardness to the old bitter Lieutenant that just rings true.The atmosphere here is fantastic with it's creepy rain drenched city & creepy hospital settings, especially the mental ward scenes & the whole movie has a polished Crime Thriller feel to it but with a supernatural Horror undertone that fits nicely into the religious Horror stuff of the first film. We see those famous steps from the first film & an atmosphere that reminded me of the Classic John Carpenter Horror ""The Fog"" & that's a huge compliment as i consider The Fog to be the greatest Horror movie ever made!!!I'm so glad I've finally seen The Exorcist 3, it's a great film & i like it alot more than the dreary first film.Scott's performance is so damn good here & you total believe in his hard character & understanding why he's the way he is. He says a fantastically true line in the movie to his old priest friend ""The whole world is a murder victim"" he means all the Death & Horror that happens constantly throughout the entire world!!! Damn he's right & damn he's a great movie Detective.A fantastic Horror Thriller with Scott's undeniably brilliant performance that grounds all the religious demonic stuff.",The Exorcist III
38,NateWatchesCoolMovies,My favourite of the series. Truly eerie stuff.,9,11 May 2016,"William Peter Blatty's The Excorcist III is my favourite in the series, and if that leaves some people aghast with disbelief, I'll still hold my stance. Don't get me wrong, the first film is a classic of atmospheric dread, the sequel is a psychedelic oddity that's also very underrated, but there's something about this one that just sat better with me than any of the others, including the two prequels with Stellen Skarsgard. This one deviates from the pattern as well as lifts the focus from Linda Blair's character, paving a cool new story for itself and breaking new ground. It's also got one of the single most terrifying moments I've ever seen on film, orchestrated perfectly enough to give a good dose of goosebumps to the strongest of spines. The immortal and always excellent George C. Scott plays Kinderman, a police lieutenant who is on the trail of a bloodthirsty serial murderer nicknamed The Gemini Killer. The killer himself has actually been long deceased, but uncanny similarities in the current crimes have freaked the police right out, and so he follows the clues to a foreboding psychiatric facility. It soon becomes clear that there's something very mysterious going on, and something very wrong with the patients. Skittish Dr. Temple (Scott Wilson) seems to know what's going on, but also seems not to, or to be too scared to divulge anything. A terrifying patient named James Venuman (Brad Dourif is so scary you'll want to hide behind the couch) seems to contain something malevolent inside him, his ravings making eerie sense to the detective. There's a few surprise cameos from veterans of the franchise, as well as work from Ed Flanders, Nicol Williamson and, believe it or not, an appearance from Fabio, of all people. The atmosphere is so thick you could choke on it, the dread hanging in the air like clammy mist, helped in part by the disturbing choice of location, Dourif's sheer ghoul act and cinematographer Gerry Fisher's camera, which lurks along walls and corridors and turns the facility into a haunted house, and our nerves into a jittering mess. Underrated as both a standalone fright flick and as an entry in the Excorcist series. Top notch creepfest.",The Exorcist III
39,drownnnsoda,"Improvement Upon ""Exorcist II"".",7,5 November 2006,"""The Exorcist"", hailed one of the scariest and best horror films of all time, wasn't done justice with the sequel ""Exorcist II: The Heretic"". So, I was (as many people probably were) skeptical as to whether or not this film was worth watching. But I'm glad I did. The film centers around Georgetown, Washington D.C., the same place where the events in the previous films occurred. George C. Scott (""The Changeling"") plays Detective Kinderman, who finds himself immersed in a mystery that is haunting the town. A serial killer is brutally murdering people around the city, including a Catholic priest who is found dead in his confessional booth. The murderer is branded the name ""The Gemini Killer"". But, is it possible that these serial killings have a disturbing link to the past exorcism? If you're expecting a film about an exorcism like the original movie, then you will be disappointed in this, because this film actually has very little do with exorcism, but more to do with the serial killings and the investigation. The plot for this film is much more than that, and I appreciated the way they went about making this sequel - rather than relying on the exorcism part of the story, they focused more on the serial killings and how the two events related to each other. George C. Scott, who blew me away with his performance in ""The Changeling"", does great in this film as well. Jason Miller returns as a disturbed patient who is actually Father Karras, and does excellent here as well, and Brad Dourif (who does the voice over for Chucky in the ""Child's Play"" films) plays the Gemini killer and is very creepy.This movie was shot very well, written and directed by William Peter Blatty, who wrote the original novel ""The Exorcist"" which the first film was based upon. For a directing debut, this movie is amazing. There is plenty of creepy imagery throughout the film, and it boasts some really surreal, dream-like sequences that are genuinely frightening.Bottom line - ""The Exorcist III"" is an excellent sequel that rises high above ""Exorcist II: The Heretic"", which was reviled by both critics and audiences back in '77. This movie is well-written, well-acted, and is really spooky. Probably the best of the ""Exorcist"" sequels. 7/10.",The Exorcist III
40,hu675,This underrated film is worth seeing and worth re-discovering.,8,2 October 2005,"Set 15 years later... after the original 1973 film. The film's plot is There's a series of brutal deaths from a copycat killer. Who have been killing off citizens of Georgetown by the name of the Gemini Killer. When a tough detective (Played by the late Oscar-Winner:George C. Scott) is investigating the series of murders. When his best friend, who is also a priest (Played by the late Ed Flanders) is murder inside the hospital. But in that hospital has also a Psychatrict Wing, where a mystery man by the name of James Venamun (Brad Dourif), who is possessed by the souls of Gemini Killer and Father Kerris (The late Jason Miller) in the same body. But the spirit of the Gemini Killer could enter the body of any human to continue his rampage. It is only the detective could stop the Gemini Killer and destroying his soul by having faith in God.Directed by Oscar-Winner:William Peter Blatty (The Ninth Configuration) made a well done different sequel to ""The Exorcist"". Which Blatty written the screenplay for the screen. Which his novel is titled ""Legion"". Although the film is flawed in places, Nicol Williamson's character brief appearance as a Priest seems out of place with the rest of the film. But Blatty's sharp dialogue (Especially the scenes between actors:Scott, Flanders, Dourif and Miller) highlighted this film.DVD has an fine anamorphic Widescreen (1.78:1) transfer and an digitally remastered-Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound. DVD only extra is the original theatrical trailer. This film wasn't a big hit as the original ""Exorcist"" was but this film stands out as it's own. Scott replaces the late Lee J. Cobb from the original film. Flanders replaces the real-life priest from the original also. Watch for Samuel L. Jackson, Fabio, Pro Basketball's Patrick Ewing and the late Viveca Lindfors. Scott Wilson and Ian Richardson appears in small supporting roles. This is a scary, off-beat sequel. Don't miss this extremely well director film that is truly a underrated supernatural thriller.

41,rooprect,A Brainy Horror Movie... not for everyone,10,1 May 2006,"Most people go to horror movies for the emotional thrill, the gore and/or the adrenaline high of having things pop out and yell ""boo!"" Make no mistake: you won't find much of that here. So if you're looking for a movie that will make you spill your popcorn, you might wanna move on.But if you're looking for a true psychological thriller (psychological = appealing to the intellect, not the viscera), this will be one hell of a treat for you. The dialogue is fantastic. The acting is superb (Brad Dourif & George C. Scott on the same screen. What could be better?). The philosophy is provocative. And the mood is as thick as it gets. Much of the movie is composed of a series of dialogues between two people in a dark room. If you liked the second half of APOCALYPSE NOW, you will enjoy this immensely.I rank this movie as one of my all time English language faves with the likes of AMADEUS, 2001, Alfred Hitchcock's ROPE, PICTURE OF DORIAN GRAY, and CITIZEN KANE. I'm serious; it's that good. Unfortunately, it was marketed to the wrong audience, and that's why it received such low ratings. Let me repeat: this is not a spooky movie. It's actually a very intellectual story with a lot of big words, literary overtones and powerful acting, and it's one of the few movies which I consider superior to the book (but of course writer Blatty directed this, so I'd expect no less).Now don't get me wrong; it's anything but dull. There is one scene in particular that will scare the living crap out of you! It's a long scene done with one still camera, no music, no sound, hardly any action... but egads it's probably the most suspenseful/frightening thing I've ever seen in any movie.In the style of the classic thrillers, so much is left to the imagination of the viewer--and oh there is PLENTY of disturbing, shocking stuff to imagine. In one conversation you'll hear about a murder so vile that you'll never want to hear the word ""catheter"" again. And the beauty is that you never see a thing. If this subtle style appeals to you, then you certainly won't be disappointed.10/10. And I don't give 10s very often.",The Exorcist III
42,Pairic,A Good Sequel,7,15 November 2020,"The Exorcist III: Been a while since I saw this and the details were a bit shady so it was good to renew my acquaintance with it. It's really Exorcist 2 as it ignores what happened in that disaster. George C. Scott plays detective Lt Kinderman who often seems to be possessed or on the brink of a heart attack, he's so shouty. A serial killer is at work, using the methods and calling cards of the Gemini Killer who was executed 15 years ago, teens, priests and nurses are slaughtered, decapitated ,crucified, drained of their blood. There's also a mysterious psychiatric patient who seems to be Fr Karras (Jason Miller), but he also died 15 years ago (during the exorcism in THe Exorcist). Some great dream sequences especially one where Kinderman is in an airport transit area between Heaven and Earth.Extremely violent and shocking in some scenes but also some dark humour as a possessed old woman scuttles along a ceiling, unseen by Kinderman. It has its flaws not least being the final exorcism scenes. The studio forced Director/Writer William Peter blatty to include this sequence. On the Horror Channel. 7/10.",The Exorcist III
43,JoeKarlosi,The Exorcist III (1990) ***1/2,9,20 August 2004,"It's now hard for me to accept that I disliked this film in 1990 when I first saw it in the theater; because through subsequent viewings at home, I've come to really like it. Just proves that certain movies get better if you give them the chance, and THE EXORCIST III is one of the best examples I can think of where a feature needs to be studied more than once to be fully appreciated.It was written and directed by William Peter Blatty, author of the original THE EXORCIST. Blatty was never quite pleased with certain aspects of William Friedkin's film version of his book, and even despised EXORCIST II - THE HERETIC (don't we all?) so he managed to satisfy himself (and perhaps those of us who loathed PART II right along with him) by fashioning a compelling and understated horror tale that actually functions better as a detective story and a proper followup to the original horror classic.Part III features George C. Scott taking over the role of Lt. Kinderman from the late Lee J. Cobb. On the 15th Anniversary of the death of Father Karras, Scott starts becoming aware of a string of brutal murders that seem to match the M.O. of a serial killer that was executed on the same fateful night that Karras took his deadly plunge down the stairway at the end of the first film. It turns out that Karras is still alive in a sanitarium, but possessed by the soul of the serial killer (played by Brad Dourif, who comes off partly effective, partly rambling). Working through the broken body of Father Karras in his cell, the killer is continuing his old murders by channeling his will through elderly catatonic patients in the hospital.One of the personal thrills for me was to see Jason Miller reprise his role as Father Karras, this time a helpless victim of the serial killer with an occasional moment or two of clarity within his own self. George C. Scott delivers a fabulous performance and was a perfect choice to continue the role of Kinderman from THE EXORCIST. Of course the movie has its flaws, the worst being the inclusion of an exorcism which Blatty never wanted to film but which the studio insisted on when they called the feature EXORCIST III (Blatty's unrealized title was to have been LEGION, based on his novel of the same name). There occasionally seems to be bits of unrelated business belonging to some other film here and there, due to post-production tampering. If not for these unfortunate kinks, EXORCIST III night have emerged as an excellent film instead of a good one.As of this writing there is strong talk of a ""Director's Cut"" DVD in the works, offering up Blatty's intended version of the movie. This can only make the film even better.",The Exorcist III
44,dworldeater,My favorite of the Exorcist movies,9,1 November 2020,"Exorcist 3 Legion is a strong return to form from writer/director William Peter Blatty . Blatty created The Exorcist and wrote the 1st film. Warner Brothers made a horrendous sequel without the involvement of the writer(, Blatty) or the director William Friedkin and the result was horrendous. Exorcist 2 The Heretic was a critical and commercial failure, that turned what could have been a lucrative franchise into a joke. Legion is a strong film with great atmosphere, dialogue and acting. George C Scott gives a pissed off and commanding performance here as Lietenant Kinderman who is in an investigation of a series of murders that bring a certain similarity to the Gemini Killer case that goes into supernatural territory. Although this was not as well directed or has a smaller budget than the 1st film, I have come to prefer Legion over it. Legion also is much more of a pure horror film and quite terrifing one at that. Legion is much darker and is much more highbrow than most of the horror films of its time. Exorcist 3 is a classic and after watching this, it is very easy to forget about the terrible 2nd film. Brad Dourif's performance is spot on and chilling, he should have won an Oscar that year for his performance in this.",The Exorcist III
45,Jonny_Numb,Unusually strong sequel,6,5 January 2007,"""Exorcist III"" has a strong anchor in George C. Scott (as Det. Kinderman, played by Lee J. Cobb in the original ""Exorcist""), an actor who gives a better performance than this type of film deserves. He is given good support by Ed Flanders (as Father Dyer), Brad Dourif (as the reincarnated ""Gemini Killer"") and Jason Miller, as Dourif's incarcerated 'host.' William Peter Blatty, author of the original novel, takes the screen writing and directing credit, producing a film that is shockingly effective in its subtlety--this is not a horror film of jump-scares and slit throats, but of atmosphere, mood, and contemplative discussion. While this adaptation of Blatty's unrelated novel ""Legion"" crams in the exorcism angle to questionable effect, he creates a tight, suspenseful tale with a dash of surrealism (what is up with that ""heaven"" sequence with Fabio?)--""Exorcist III"" is a strong film and a fine franchise entry (especially after John Boorman's lamentable ""Exorcist II: The Heretic""), but don't expect projectile vomiting, crucifix masturbation, and the other shock effects of its predecessor.",The Exorcist III
46,truemythmedia,Underrated. Brad Dourif is Awesome.,7,30 October 2019,"The best part of this movie is when Brad Dourif (""Child's Play""), confessing to being the Gemini killer, gleefully says, ""Child's play, lieutenant!"" I'm not sure if it were intended, but I certainly took it as a reference to Dourif's killer doll franchise, which, by 1990, had already seen one sequel. It had me in stitches.Honestly, though, as a whole this movie isn't that bad; it's certainly better than the 56% rating it received on Rotten Tomatoes, but I think there's a reason for that. A lot of times, horror sequels get sort of a tarnished reputation before they even hit theaters (""Paranormal Activity 3"" was okay!). Horror is already the ugly stepchild of the genres when looked at by critics. Often times, movies that I, personally, would consider completely watchable, if not decent, are completely lambasted by some critics for a few less impressive minor details. Yet, while I am rushing to this film's defense, I will admit that it is far from perfect, and it's far from the level of quality of ""The Exorcist"" too, but that shouldn't be surprising; ""The Exorcist"" is a classic that has been revered for close to fifty years- few films do have that reputation. Ninety-percent of the time we watch movies, we're not watching the best movies ever made, we're watching whatever it is that tickled our fancy that particular day, and while ""Exorcist 3"" wont ever be remembered as a great or groundbreaking film, it's perfectly passable as a way to kill a few hours on a dreary Sunday afternoon in October.",The Exorcist III
47,Reviews_of_the_Dead,Worthy Follow-up to a Classic,8,17 June 2019,"This film I sought out not realizing there was a second sequel to The Exorcist. The fact that this is actually based on the sequel novel that director and writer of the screenplay, William Peter Blatty, penned made it even more interesting. I will be honest, I thought this was okay the first time I saw this, but its taken a few viewings now to fully appreciate it. The synopsis is a police lieutenant uncovers more than he bargained for as his investigation of a series of murders, which have all the hallmarks of the deceased Gemini serial killer, leads him to question the patients of a psychiatric ward.We begin 15 years after the events of The Exorcist. We see Georgetown through the eyes of someone as they walk down the street until we see the body of a boy is found by the water. We learn that he is strung to a makeshift cross and his head has been removed, being replaced by a head of a Jesus from a statue in blackface.The officer that is investigating is Kinderman (George C. Scott). This is the same officer from the original film, just played by a different actor. We see him as he meets a friend on the anniversary of the death of Father Damien Karras. This priest that Kinderman meets is Father Dyer (Ed Flanders). He is also the same one from the first film, just a different actor. Kinderman was held up at home and is late meeting him for a movie, 'It's a Wonderful Life'.There is then another murder, this time of a priest. We see as he is listening to a woman give her confession and the things she starts confess are horrible. The priest is then killed. The nature of his death is not normal either. Before it cuts away, we see an elderly woman along with another.Both of these victims have a drug in their system that is used during electro-shock therapy. The victims are paralyzed, then killed while they're being tortured. Kinderman is sure that the fingerprints will match, but is stumped when they don't. He doesn't understand how there can be two different killers when they are so similar in how they were done. They are even matching details of the original Gemini Killer that weren't released to the press.Father Dyer is then admitted into the hospital. Kinderman is upset, but tries not to show it as he messes with him. Dyer doesn't seem to be too distraught about being in the hospital and is really downplaying it. Kinderman that night has a nightmare where he is in heaven and meets people along the way. He meets the murdered boy who is fine now, just with his head sewn back on. He sees people like Fabio, Samuel L. Jacson and Patrick Ewing. He ends up running into Dyer there. He asks if he is dreaming too and he learns that Flanders isn't. He is awoken by the phone ringing.He goes to the hospital to find that Dyer has been murdered. His blood has been drained from his body into cups that are used for urine tests. There is also a message written on the wall, stating that 'It's a Wonderfull Life'. None of his blood was split though. He wants the hospital almost on a lockdown to try to investigate this case. There is a point where he is leaving that we see there is a statue that is missing its head. Things take an even darker turn when he finds a patient being held in a locked down ward that makes Kinderman's blood run cold. Who is committing these murders and how are they doing it?I have to say that this is the third time I've seen this film. It really had a great premise and I also have read the novel this is somewhat based on, Legion. I also have read up on some trivia and this film could have been much better if the studio would have let Blatty make the film that he wanted. Despite that, I think this film is still really good. I love the idea that the person in the lock down room, known as Patient X (Jason Miller), has been kept alive despite the trauma to the body. The death occurred the same night as The Gemini Killer's execution and his soul was transferred. It is plausible that the brain damage sustained would take 15 years to fix itself.The relationship between Kinderman and Dyer is good too. We only get that for about the first half hour of the film, but it actually reminds me of my friendships. We will bust each other's chops for fun, but we would do anything for them. The death of Dyer really spurs Kinderman to really need to solve this case. It definitely becomes personal.As you can tell, I do like the story and concept of this film. I don't even mind having an attempted exorcism at the end. It makes it similar to the first one, especially since we don't really see much of Father Morning (Nicol Williamson) until it happens. He gets even less time during the exorcism as well than what Max Von Sydow did in the original one. It does feel like it wasn't part of the film and that makes sense as I was reading up on the production of this.To move to the pacing of the film, which I used to feel like it was boring, but after this viewing, I could see how things fit together now and it makes sense. There's actually some excellent writing here of things that are brought back up later in the film and I'm all on board with that. I think the mystery of what going on is a bit slow, but as things really get revealed, I'm all for it. I do fee like there are some slight plot-holes, but nothing to fully ruin this. The ending is fine, even though I would have liked to see what Blatty really wanted to do.The acting for the film is really great actually. Scott is a legend and I'll be honest, he's one of my favorite actors of all time. He's one that I really didn't get into his filmography until a bit later in life, but once I did, he just has such a screen presence. Flanders is good in his role, especially how well he plays off Scott. Brad Dourif is The Gemini Killer and I really loved his performance. I got chills this time, because I could hear his most iconic role as the voice of Chucky from Child's Play this time. What I like is that I interpret, he's not really there, but this is what Patient X sees themselves as Kinderman talks to him. Miller is solid in his small role. Also want to shout-out to Williamson, Scott Wilson and Nancy Fish, the all have solid performances while the rest of the cast rounded out the film for what was needed.The last thing to cover would be the effects of the film. We don't get a whole lot and a lot of them are later in the film. There is an amazing jump-scare that everyone talks about. There is also a really creepy scene that involves someone walking on the ceiling that unnerved me. Most things here were done practically, which I liked, especially the look of The Gemini Killer and Patient X later in the film. Overall I'd say these were pretty well done in the grand scheme.With that said, I would recommend this film if you are interested in seeing all of the films that were in this series. This one is good and a solid follow-up to the original film. The story and concept are good; it is kind of a supernatural slasher if you really think about it. The studio interference I feel like does make this a bit disjointed. The cast of the film is good. There is a bit of the film that is a bit slow, but I think that overall it makes sense for how things play out. The effects of the film are good, I didn't have any issues there and the soundtrack is fitting for what they needed. To be honest this could be viewed by itself or along with the original. This is definitely a good film in my opinion, but might not be for everyone, especially if you are looking for The Exorcist.",The Exorcist III
48,Zbigniew_Krycsiwiki,Great psychological horror,8,24 August 2015,"Ignoring what an abomination Exorcist II was, Wm. Peter Blatty returned to his long dormant sequel to The Exorcist, with this well cast thriller, concerning a cop investigating a series of brutal killings whose Modus Operandi is that of a serial killer executed 17 years earlier. He learns of a catatonic asylum inmate who claims to be the real killer, and who bears an uncanny resemblance to the long thought deceased Father Damian Karras.Blatty, forced by the studio to cast Jason Miller from the original film, does a great job of integrating his character into the story, in almost a Jekyll and Hyde/ split personality situation. The literary screenplay, while occasionally verbose, is very well written, giving the audience plenty of psychological stimuli, mixing detective story, thriller, and horror genres, along with some quite witty banter to relieve the tension, and give the audience a chance to catch their breath.This is a good horror, without being as intentionally gruesome as the first film. Subtle, intellectual horror, venturing deep into the corridors of this Jekyll/ Hyde villain's twisted mind, and ultimately giving closure to the first film's story, yet it still gives us a few shocks, with the killer jumping up being the nurse, with shears in hand, the white sheet covering him brightly lit, with a quick musical crescendo, which echoes for several seconds being my favourite scene in the film. I think this is my favourite in this trilogy, although I am reducing its score a bit due to the studio interference, which occasionally results in some choppy editing. Curiously though, the climactic exorcism (which was also forced on Blatty by the studio) really does seem out of place. Blatty should have been allowed to keep his original low key ending.",The Exorcist III

50,capkronos,Great movie; bogged down a bit by producer interference.,8,3 April 2002,"Taking a much different approach than the first two EXORCIST films will either infuriate or please viewers depending on their expectations, and there's just no use arguing with people on the merits of this film, because something can be said for those who love it AND those who hate it. However, I have huge admiration for the nerve it took William Peter Blatty to bring his distinct vision to the screen and take big chances with this film. The end result is never boring and it refuses to be stupid, even when it threatens to fall apart from all the overly-complicated plot weirdness. There's loads of subtext here, it's not nearly as dependent on FX and gore than the first film, it has creepy atmosphere to burn and delivers a few great shocks (including a now-legendary hospital corridor scene; though some of the most horrible things in this film are implied, not shown). The writing is very good, and there's smart dialogue and three-dimensional characters played by some first-rate actors. George C. Scott is wonderful (when isn't he?) in the lead, with Jason Miller, Brad Dourif (one of the most underrated actors ever), Ed Flanders, Scott Wilson and everyone else contributing heavily.I heard the senseless exorcism climax (featuring Nicol Williamson) was added to the film later against Blatty's wishes so audiences wouldn't be ""confused,"" which basically means the studio who financed it take the general viewing public as idiots.Make sure to also check out Blatty's great THE NINTH CONFIGURATION (AKA TWINKLE, TWINKLE, KILLER KANE), also a pretty underrated movie. I noticed he hasn't returned to scripting/directing film since this was made, probably because it wasn't well received at the time, but it's nice to read other comments and see I'm not the only one who really enjoyed this film.Score: 8 out of 10",The Exorcist III
51,oneguyrambling,Don't write the series of just because of E2 - this is good stuff!,7,3 November 2010,"I had the misfortune of watching The Exorcist 2 a couple months back.The film was boring, lazy and in no way a worthy successor to the original film, so the writer decided ""enough"" and took the reins for The Exorcist 3, both writing the screenplay and directing the film - and he did a far better job.The problem faced by this film is twofold, firstly regardless of how good it is people will still say that ""sure it's better than 2, but that's not hard"", the other problem is that there was no way that it would top ""The Exorcist"", still a classic 30+ years after release.And of course here we are, a film far superior to the god-awful second, but not quite in the same league as the first, though precious few films are.William Peter Blatty the writer of the original and this, and the director of 3 keeps a consistently creepy tone, there isn't much violence shown on screen or even after the event, though there are some pretty graphic descriptions. The only variations are the first couple of minutes and the ultimate showdown finale, which veer dangerously into cheesy territory.Take the intro as a prime example, after some ominous nothings a church door flies open and leaves and debris fly in, which apparently awakens a statue of Jesus on the cross, who then cries? Seriously, this really happened. ""Naughty leaves, you woke Jesus!"" I can't help but feel that somehow a studio got involved and told the director ""look we like what you've done, but you have to open the film with a bang and close it with a big wild showdown. Neither change helped the film but it doesn't really detract too much.The film is filled with realistic, normal everyday looking characters who talk in a fairly realistic way, given what occurs around them of course.The basic plot is different to both the original and 2, no Reagan here, although she is very briefly referenced early on. A cop named Bill Kinderman, who was good friends with the priest from the first film, is now good buddies with another priest, Father Dyer who is a little morose about the state of the world. They obviously have known each other for some time and discuss their situations freely. He tells the priest of a recent killing, a young teenage boy is decapitated and the body butchered in ritualistic fashion, shortly after another priest is murdered while hearing confession also in graphic fashion.Given his occupation and what he sees everyday Bill has a pretty wacko dream, and I mean wacko. Want proof? Not only does the dream sequence have some pretty out there stuff going on, it also has Fabio and Samuel L Jackson as bystanders and a young Patrick Ewing as the Angel of Death.Bill wakes up to find out that Father Dyer is dead in hospital, and not just dead, drained of blood dead.Bill immediately orders the hospital shut down, much to the chagrin of the hospital management. He then explains the nature of a case from 15 years prior, the case of the Gemini Killer.The Gemini Killer was a serial killer who performed depraved, unworldly executions of innocent and somewhat random victims, Bill goes on to describe specific details that were not released to the public, but which are now being performed on the new victims, the boy and priests. Bill believes that somehow the Gemini Killer is back.Lo and behold a patient in the same hospital claims to be the killer, and in a one on one chat he tells Bill in no uncertain terms that this is the case, and describes several things that only the killer would know. Not only this, but to Bill from time to time the patient appears to change from the actor Brad Dourif to Father Karras from the original film, this would obviously be a bit unnerving, on top of this his voice alters periodically into a demonic rasp.To describe what happens after would start giving the game away, nonetheless Bill and the Gemini Killer are destined to come face to face, Brad Dourif gives a powerful performance which could have easily been cartoonish and hammy in lesser hands.There are two really memorable scenes in the second half of the film, one has echoes of events in the first but is pretty jaw dropping and unexpected when it happens, the second is pretty well known and occurs over a patient two minute single shot when a nurse in the hospital is doing her rounds.I remember a few years back there were two Exorcist prequels being released at the same time, so they altered the names a little.I bet Blatty wishes that he could retitle The Exorcist 2 to anything but, as The Exorcist 3 is the only worthy sequel to the masterful original, and a strong movie in its own right.Final Rating – 7.5 / 10.

53,ODDBear,Solid sequel,7,6 July 2007,"The only real sequel to The Exorcist finds Ltd. Kinderman faced with a nasty serial killer whose modus operandi resembles a killer who was executed the same night as the original exorcism of Regan took place. A mental patient claiming to be the murderer is a dead-on lookalike to Father Damien Karras, the priest who fell to his death on that fateful night.Mood and atmosphere best describe the William Peter Blatty directed Exorcist III. The horror is hinted at (and explained in long speeches) but very little is shown. The brooding mood is slowly built and maintained until a silly (and rushed) conclusion involving an exorcism (which producer's deemed necessary because of the film's title).Blatty's script is intelligent and philosophical, not unlike the original where the power of suggestion works far better than on screen mayhem. Brad Dourif's monologues are downright creepy at times and the scenes between him and Scott are very impressive.Despite it's bloodless nature the film has at least two outstanding seat jumpers (white figure and scissors anyone!). If it wasn't for the disappointing final 10 minutes or so the film would be awesome. As is, it's a fine horror film with some definite highlights, intelligently written but misses the bull's eye.",The Exorcist III

I got what I expected. William Peter Blatty's ""The Exorcist III"" was a truly wonderful movie. Cerebral, but very engrossing and full of surprises. By the looks of it, this is the true sequel to the original ""The Exorcist"". This sequel tells more of a cerebral mystery story about Lt. Kinderman (A superb performance by George C. Scott) investigating a series of murders, supposedly committed by the long-dead Gemini Killer (Brad Dourif). The murders could also be connected with the possession and exorcism which happened sometime ago. The supporting cast includes a return by Jason Miller, reprising his role as Damien Karras. Ed Flanders as Father Joseph Dyer and Nicol Williamson as Father Morning, a Father Merrin-alike who's welcome is extended so a priest vs. devil can take place, a demand made by the studio to fully cash-in as an EXORCIST sequel. But the studio butchering doesn't badly jeopardize the story and Blatty's terrific direction. Up until the finale, it's a cerebral and mind-bending thriller. Rating: **** out of 5.",The Exorcist III
55,CitizenCaine,Exorcist III Much Better Than Exorcist II: The Heretic,6,28 August 2009,"After the disappointments, howls of laughter, and John Boorman's reedited Exorcist II: The Heretic failed so miserably with the critics, few thought the franchise would be resurrected yet again for a third film: Exorcist III: Legion. However, it was well known that William Peter Blatty had a script featuring Lieutenant Kinderman from the first film, which was reworked to the point of being unrecognizable in the second film. As a result, director William Friedkin and Ellen Burstyn stayed away from the second film. Somehow the idea reemerged and Blatty directed this film himself after failing to persuade Friedkin and then horror maven John Carpenter to step in.George C. Scott was an excellent choice to play Kinderman, the role created by Lee J. Cobb in the original film. Scott has just the right combination of cunning, determination, intelligence, and psychological vulnerability to portray a policeman on the trail of a diabolical mystery. The top notch acting extends to the supporting roles as well, with Ed Flanders, Brad Dourif, Nicol Williamson, Scott Wilson, Nancy Fish, George DiCenzo, and Viveca Lindfors adding credibility and talent to the roles they play. Jason Miller also returns in a very unique role. Unlike the second film with Richard Burton, the acting makes this film work along with the much better script. William Peter Blatty had to rework the script several times in order to satisfy studio bigwigs with establishing more of a connection, however remote, with the first film (including changing the title of the film to Exorcist III: Legion, instead of just Legion). Hence, the addition of Jason Miller to the cast, who played Father Karras in the original film. As a result, the main weakness of the film is the existential/metaphysical/religious elements involving the characters played by Brad Dourif and Jason Miller. The film would have worked, and much better at that, without the forced connection to the whole exorcist story. As it is, some less sophisticated viewers may erroneously equate possession with mental illness. The film contains pretty good special effects, as well as some frightening scenes, the hallway scene with the nurses' station among them. However, no real psychiatric ward would be as poorly lit as the one in the film obviously. The effects in this film actually are as good and better than anything in any of the other exorcist films, including the two prequels made later. Several notables appear briefly in the film, including Samuel L. Jackson and Larry King. Georgetown University basketball coach John Thompson appears, and New York Knicks' star Patrick Ewing and male model Fabio appear as angels in a dream sequence. Colleen Dewhurst, ex-wife x 2 of George C. Scott, provides the demonic voice and maybe more than a passing frightening frame of reference for Scott. **1/2 of 4 stars.",The Exorcist III
56,fernandoschiavi,"The Exorcist 3 manages to visually impact. The dreamlike photography and lighting, framings that give rise to genuine scares and the mechanisms that engender our fear",6,10 October 2021,"An uncomfortable drip, in a claustrophobic and dark environment, amplifies Lieutenant Kinderman's tension in one of the most terrifying moments of the film The Exorcist 3 and the book Legion, both by William Peter Blatty. The adaptation was made thirteen years after the release of the official sequel, The Exorcist II - The Heretic, by John Boorman, considered one of the worst sequences of all time, shrouded in silly symbolism and in a flawed context. During the period when Part 2 was defensible by critics and fans of the original, Blatty wrote his official vision for a new film, without repeating the formula of the first one and moving towards an investigative thriller, with elements of supernatural horror.In the plot, the old acquaintance of The Exorcist fans, Lieutenant Kinderman, now played by Oscar-winning George C. Scott (since it would have been impossible for Lee Cobs to return to the role, having died just three years after the release of the first film) is at turns with an investigation into the murder of an altar boy named Thomas Kintry (James Burgess), decapitated, having the head of a statue of Christ placed in its place and crucified on two oars. Then we have a new victim, a local priest, also beheaded after an old lady's confession.The fingerprints don't match, suggesting that two different people were responsible. Kinderman is an old friend of Father Dyer (Ed Flanders), the same one who gave the extreme anointing to Damien Karras, the one who took Pazuzu in Regan's beating and rolled down the stairs, another character recurring in the novel and original film. Dyer checks into a hospital for a routine checkup and wakes up the next morning dead, with all the blood drained from his body and placed in small jars. The paths of investigation lead Kinderman to discover that the killer has the same modus operandi of a serial killer known as the Gemini Killer (clearly inspired by the Zodiac Killer), since some details of the crime are identical and known only to the police. Only the psychopath had been fried in the electric chair 15 years ago.So the startling revelation at the time, told by hospital psychiatrist Dr. Temple (Scott Wilson) is that in the maximum security ward is a guy who got there exactly... 15 years (oh, yeah?), with amnesia and condition catatonic, coming out of that stage a few days ago, just as the series of murders began. Upon visiting Patient X, Kinderman discovers that he is actually Father Karras, and in fact everything that was happening was nothing more than a revenge by Pazuzu (or the Legion, after all he has several names), who when he was expelled from Regan and briefly possessing the parson, he ordered the spirit of the Gemini Killer (which must have been yet another of his demonic manifestations, something never quite explained) to enter his body. Since then, he has taken the elderly, catatonic patients from the psychiatric ward and commands them to commit all those heinous crimes.But then we get into the detail that ruined The Exorcist III's reputation and made it so ill-fated. Until then, the film is built superbly, so to speak. The climate built by Blattey is one of the grimmest, gloomy, mixing blasphemy with descriptions of violent murders, a lot of religious and oneiric symbolism, and the essence of psychological terror. Some scenes are truly chilling, such as the drawn-out death sequence of Nurse Keating (Tracy Thorne), which ends with a figure wearing sacred robes, armed with autopsy scissors, comes out of the hallway and cuts his head off, or when a of possessed old ladies walks on the ceiling of one of the rooms.But when showing the first cut to the infamous producers, the bastards didn't like what they saw, they decided to impose on Blatty that the entire third act be redone and that, of course, there was an exorcism, to even bring it closer to the original. Reluctantly, Blatty complied with the requests (after all, if he didn't, someone else would. According to the filmmaker, Morgan Creek forced the use of the title that references the first one and also the need to include an exorcism, something that it doesn't exist in the literary version. So, although the principal photography was already complete, it was necessary to add the character of Father Morning, played by Nicol Williamson, and also hire actor Jason Miller, who played Father Karras in the classic, to create a bond. Interestingly, Brad Dourif had already done all of his scenes as the Gemini Killer and had to alternate his lines with Miller, making it difficult for the viewer who had no contact with the written work to understand. Remakes also happened with the following film, Exorcist - The Beginning, which went on to have two versions like the one previously filmed, Domain, by Paul Schrader.All of Blatty's psychological horror, dark and heavy atmosphere and supernatural game play goes into space, and we're treated to another throwaway scene of exorcism full of special effects, pyrotechnics, yellow eyes, levitations, snakes and that cost another four millions of dollars to the studio, plummeting the film to the infamous status it enjoys today, as well as public and critical abhorrence at its release.Ultimately, Blatty, Brad Dourif, and George C. Scott were nervous of the studio and the end result is a very different cut from the director/screenwriter. With these mandatory changes, The Exorcist III is far removed from the author's pretensions. Even so, it's far superior to the second film, without the need for an intimate relationship with the classic. It's a production that works alone, respecting the events of the 1973 film, and that has chilling moments in a fascinating and curious plot.Having all this troubled context, this third film has its merits. It's not a film like the original, nor should it be included in any featured list, but it has a curious narrative, good characters and some scares. It is an adaptation with a very discreet relationship with the literary version, and even earns more points than the book for the changes developed and that gave the film the climax that was missing in the final pages of ""Legion"". A more careful editing and some technical tweaks and The Exorcist 3 could well serve as an independent production, an almost fanfic of the classic.Exorcist III, after all, is a sequel that lives up to the original, with a dark, well-constructed atmosphere and really dense, violent, and profane moments. Of course it also has a serious editing problem and its glaring script errors, even more so if we take into account some aspects of The Exorcist, like when Kinderman says Karras was his best friend, and actually met after the murder of Burke Dennings and we know the priest would ""die"" soon after, or the fact that we had to swallow every victim with a first, last or middle name starting with the letter K (another MO from the Gemini Killer), and suddenly everyone around the case coincidentally has the letter of the alphabet on his RG (including people related to Regan's exorcism, by the way), such as the boy, the priests, the nurse, and so on.Over its 110 minutes, The Exorcist 3 manages to visually impact. The dreamlike photography and lighting, framings that give rise to genuine scares and the mechanisms that engender our fear of the macabre, among other qualities. These qualities, however, are not enough to insure his lack of dignity in the excessive third act.Out of curiosity, for years, since the release of The Exorcist 3, William Peter Blatty has struggled to get his ""Director's Cut"" version of the film out of the cut scenes - and also without the additions he deemed unnecessary. Morgan Creek always reported that the material had been lost and that there would never be an uncut version of the author's wife's lament in interviews. However, just before the writer's death (died January 12, 2017), in October 2016, scenes were found and the film was finally released as Blatty wanted. With the limited viewing, public opinion split between those who didn't see much of anything and those who thought it could have been much better rated. ""Director's Cut"" isn't quite that different from the movie released in 1990, as it was with the changes to The Exorcist 2 and Exorcist: The Beginning.",The Exorcist III
57,rainking_es,Not bad ... much better than Exorcist II.,6,16 June 2006,"What's best about ""The Exorcist III"" is that although it's a sequel of William Friedkin's masterpiece, it isn't much connected to the plot of the original movie. It works OK as a terror movie involving a serial killer. It's pretty entertaining and bad-tempered George C. Scott plays his role just brilliantly.If you think that ""The exorcist III"" must be nothing but rubbish just because ""The exorcist II"" was, forget it.

One of the scenes selected was from this movie and since it sent a chill down my spine so I decided to give the rest of the film a chance. That's when my blood damn near froze.Seeing that ""Exorcist III"" is a third entry in a franchise in which the second film has a very low reputation and the fourth didn't exactly draw much noise probably gets many people to overlook this film. The fact is that it is the Exorcist label that works against it. This is not really an exorcist movie as the original source novel was similar in theme, but not a sequel to Blatty's ""The Exorcist."" The exorcism scene was added in the middle of production and it feels slightly out of place with the rest of the film.However, it also provides an eerie element as the re-shot scenes has Jason Miller and the originally shot scenes had Brad Dourif and the final product cuts back between the two. It works in a creepy way, just watch and you'll understand. Though the film's best part is the incredible atmosphere. It is really something. Haunting music, dream sequences, and good mixture of the classic ""jump scare"" along with some brilliant ""quiet scares"" for lack of better word. The scene that drew me to this film is an almost update of the infamous ""spider-walk"" from the first ""Exorcist."" It is a terrifically designed scene, among many I might add, so you begin to wonder why Blatty didn't direct more films? I am almost itching to see what else he could come up with on screen.This is a thoroughly enjoyable and smart horror film with above average acting, writing, directing, and design as well as everything else. And it is best thought of as separate from the Exorcist series, just like the book was, even if it does include an exorcism. --- 8/10Rated R for violent content/terror. Ages 13+",The Exorcist III

61,suspiria10,"""I believe...""",8,8 December 2004,"The first 'true' and so far best sequel to the amazing 1974 original sees George C. Scott stepping into the role of Detective Kinderman (played by the late Lee J. Cobb in the original) who is investigating a series of homicides in Georgetown. The homicides, grisly in nature, follow the M.O. of the Gemini killer, a man convicted and sent to death in the electric chair 15 years ago. Several characters return this time around from the original film including Kinderman, Father Dyer (Ed Flanders) and Damian Karras again played by Jason Miller. First up I'll talk about the acting. The cast did a bloody good job in their roles. Scott gives a tour de force performance where he mixes grandfatherly likability with someone who is clearly struggling with demons of his own. It is clear why this man is one of the best character actors of the silver screen. The few scenes that he shared with Father Dyer were played so well you really thought they had been lifelong friends. The other acting coup was getting Brad Dourif to play the Gemini killer. He proves here that he will always be more than the voice of our favorite pint-sized plastic doll from hell. His character spends the film being shackled in a cell but yet is able to convey a sense of menace few can provide with the help of other actors, props and settings. Jason Miller returns also as the 'body' of Father Karras and swaps back and forth the role with Dourif. The Kinderman / Karras / Gemini scenes are the highlight of the film. The actors go full bore at each other and turn what could have become boring exposition scenes into film highlights. William Peter Blatty stepped up to the plate and directs this time around. He took a book he wrote, Legion and tweaked it into the screenplay for part 3. I believe, but am not positive, that the exorcism at the end of the film in not in the book. Unfortunately I haven't read it since just before the movie came out and can't remember. The direction here is done very well for his second film. He sets up a chilly atmosphere when needed the most and steps aside to let the actors do their thing. Fairly straight-forward he lets the story role without flashy visuals getting in the way, signs of a true writer. The story is character driven with a few creepy moments but I had wished the atmosphere had been a little denser with scares at the end though. This effort comes closest to the original.The music score is a bit light with many of the better scenes given over strictly to audio effects. A little bit disappointing but doesn't affect things too badly.In the end you have a good sequel with a character driven script and a bunch of top notch actors ripping it up. Unfortunately I thought the ending was a bit rushed with the inclusion of the exorcism is just a little out of place. What for most of the film seems like a classic example of the walk-in of an 'old soul' suddenly becomes a possession story. But you got to give the distributors what they want I guess.",The Exorcist III
62,MattBrady099,The Exorcist III - Movie Review,7,24 October 2016,"The Exorcist III isn't nearly as brilliant as the first movie, but compare it to the sequel, it's a masterpiece. This is what I call sluggish film that you'll need a lot of patience to get to the good stuff. Well, the whole movie is kind of like that. Every time I think something is going to progress with the story it jumps right back. Luckily it doesn't do that too often and it's only for build up (i guess).But it's not to say that ""The Exorcist III"" doesn't have it's scary parts, because it really dose. There's moments that are so eerie and quite shocking that the movie quickly cuts away to next scene so you don't even have a reaction or a thought of what you just seen. The movie takes a few minutes of silence as the scene plays on and then BOOM! And this actually did get to me. A great example of this is the Nurse scene which is one of the scariest scenes in movie history. During the scene you really don't get a sense of damage, but more of a safe feeling as every thing seems to be alright, until the horror kicks in. And I know that sounds very similar to every horror movie that use it's scars, but I think those movies get it completely wrong of how to make the build up and the scare executed in a way that it's effective. I think this is something that's missing in horror today.Brad Douriff is in this movie playing The Gemini killer and he's freaking amazing. This is one of the best performances I've seen from Douriff and it just proves of how talented this guy truly is. I would go as far to say it's Oscar worthy and he isn't in the movie that much. He's so creepy and frightening that he steals the show.But the actor that I thought was going to steal the show was George C. Scott, which is sadly not the case. He's a great actor and he was excellent in ""Patton"", but I found he's performance in this to be a bit over the top. I mean, I don't think he was RAZZIE worthy bad or anything, but he over reacted in the wrong parts. It came off a bit laughable. It's until the very end when he gets to shine as he's really giving it he's all. I give him that.The interesting thing I found out about the movie (after i finished watching it) was that the author of the book William Peter Blatty wrote & directed this. You know when you hear people complaint that when a movie adaptation isn't as accurate to the novel it's based on. Well, it's kinda refreshing (to me) for an author to make the movie that he wanted to see. And I can say that he exceed in a few parts even if the whole thing feels a bit disjointed, and that goes to the writing.Overall rating: ""The Exorcist III"" while not great, but at least gets back to it's roots of having a dark and unsettling atmosphere, something that was missing in ""Exorcist II"". The movie is honestly worth watching just for Brad Douriff performance.",The Exorcist III

64,ofumalow,"re: ""William Peter Blatty's Legion"" aka the director's cut in blu-ray set",5,5 February 2021,"I haven't watched the theatrical version for a while, though I do like it quite a bit and would willingly watch it again. But I was very, very curious to see the reconstruction of Blatty's intended version (on Disc 2 of the 2016 blu-ray release), before the studio forced a great deal of cuts, reshoots and inserted new material. Those changes most dramatically impacted the final third, but are very present throughout.The theatrical cut is a movie with a lot of problems but also great ideas and some truly memorable scenes. The ""director's cut"" in this form (presumably at some point there may be a better version) must be cut a certain amount of slack because the restored footage seems largely to have come from dailies on VHS, so of course they are not at all of the same visual quality and make for a somewhat jagged overall package.Still, it's safe to say that while you like to think the writer-director is always right, in this case the studio had some legitimate gripes, and not just in the sense of commercial potential. (Most famously, they insisted reshoots must include an actual exorcism of sorts to give the people their money's worth.) I really like the snappy patter between George C. Scott and many characters, but the truth is that Blatty's version spends too much time on quirky character business, and too little time on building suspense or delivering frights. I love Brad Dourif, but his restored earlier scenes are overlong dialogues in which he is stuck trying too hard to be freaky and scary, ending up a bit silly instead. (A low point is when we're supposed to be scared by his being able to imitate the noises of a train.) And the ending here is too abrupt, anticlimactic, and unconvincing in terms of actually solving anything--why would killing a host do anything more than just temporarily halt the nefarious activities of an evil spirit? Without having seen it in quite a while, I can still say that the theatrical ending, while it did feel pasted-on and over the top, nonetheless did provide enough sound and fury that one felt the story had actually come to a fitting, climactic conclusion.So...very glad to have had my curiosity satisfied. But this version of ""Exorcist III"" is a little too much like Paul Schrader's later ""Dominion,"" another ""Exorcist"" sequel the studio rejected and had reshot (that time even more drastically, resulting in a wholly different film by a different director, with a different title). It's got the same problem of taking itself so seriously that it is a somewhat talky bore that never quite works as a genre piece, or for that matter as some kind of quasi-genre meditation on faith, good vs. evil, etc. This is still a better film than ""Dominion,"" but again, one can see why the studio ""interfered"": It's not what anyone wants from an ""Exorcist"" movie, but it doesn't really work on any other terms, either.",The Exorcist III

A killer named The Gemini Killer was supposedly killed 15 years before, the same time as Father Karras. And they have both reappeared in a dementia ward at a hospital...as one person. Soon murders begin to occur in The Gemini Killer's style, and Kinderman is left to find out how its possible if he's in the ward. Brad Dourif (One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, Child's Play, Mississippi Burning) gives yet another great, evil performance as James Venamun/The Gemini Killer.

66,avik-basu1889,"A solid, well directed horror film !!!",8,30 January 2017,"'The Exorcist III' in my mind is not as good a film as the original 'The Exorcist', however if anyone wants to watch a very well directed horror film that is genuinely creepy and has reasonable thematic depth, this is certainly a film that can be seen and admired.'The Exorcist' was a much more mature and sophisticated exploration of the mysteries of faith and the role of religion/faith in a rapidly progressive society. 'The Exorcist III' in a comparative sense lacks the thematic depth of the first film. The theme is to show how the spirit of evil can overwhelm the body and spirit of our heroes and institutions, but in the end, with the help of selfless sacrifice and undying faith, the good in this world will always overcome evil. But what can be perceived to be a comparative lack of depth in William Peter Blatty's script, gets to a great extent made up for by Blatty's inspired direction. He masterfully executes horror set- pieces some of which genuinely gave me the heebie-jeebies. Friedkin's influence on the visual style is very apparent(Blatty even uses the 'Psycho' overhead falling shot that Friedkin used in the first film with the doctor). However in spite of Friedkin's influence, I think the surrealistic bravura of Blatty's visual storytelling has an impressive forceful uniqueness to it. I have to admire the cinematography and the sound-mixing which complement each other in the process of creating the uncomfortably creepy vibe of the film.George C. Scott adds the world-weary gravitas to the character of Kinderman. He is headstrong, determined and dogged in his profession, but one can notice a certain sense of hopelessness that his character has picked up with age and experience which makes the mental state of Kinderman somewhat similar to the mental state of Sheriff Bell's(Tommy Lee Jones) character in 'No Country for Old Men'. Brad Bourif and Jason Miller also deserve special mention. The screenplay of 'The Exorcist III' gives more priority to perfunctory elements in tune with the genre of horror over thematic depth which makes it a horror film with some dramatic elements unlike 'The Exorcist' which was a hardcore drama with horror elements. However Blatty's uninhibitedly heightened style of direction and his ability to successfully ratchet up the volatility of a particular scene can be really fun. It's not a 'great' film, but it still is well made and deserves to be seen.",The Exorcist III
67,skybrick736,The Exorcist III (7/10),7,25 November 2015,"The Exorcist III is simply one of those underrated gyms that get overlooked because of the abundant amount of sequels pumped out from money grabbing movie makers. So what is the primary reason why the Exorcist III surpassed the second installment by far? It's all because William Peter Blatty wrote and directed a film sequel to his original novel made into a screenplay. The film brought back the hard hitting grotesque dialogue and most importantly the scare factor. Blatty shot the film to tend towards the psychological horror aspects but he added a scare factor that brought tense, jumpy scenes. The film is often accredited to having one of the scariest movie moments that absolutely no one saw coming.Along with the phenomenal writing, direction and filmmaking there were some great characters portrayed with adequate acting. George C. Scott as the main protagonist did a good job and Brad Dourif was a nice touch, however parts of the supporting cast weren't all that great. The cameo list is impressive and very odd, I won't spoil a couple of them but to show how strange some are to the film, an example is Patrick Ewing as The Angel of Death. There are some other curious, questionable aspects about Exorcist III but it stands out to being a formidable entry the possession genre and an excellent crime thriller.",The Exorcist III
68,charchuk,"Surprisingly good, but unfortunately tampered with",8,11 February 2007,"Surprisingly good second sequel, especially given the quality of Exorcist II. Blatty is a pretty good director, as some of the shots are stunning in their patience and composition (the hallway scene especially). The visuals are impressive and effective, and not overused. Unfortunately, the story doesn't quite measure up. It's an interesting blend of the first Exorcist and the real-life Zodiac killings, but it doesn't work as well as it should, and sometimes loses the viewer to confusion. The ending doesn't fit at all, either, along with the whole subplot with Father Morning, though I know that's not Blatty's fault. Still, it takes away from the film, which doesn't need an exorcism at the end to remain effectively scary. All in all, it's a good film that unfortunately suffers from studio pressure.",The Exorcist III
69,squeezebox,One good scare surrounded by heavy handed mumbo jumbo,3,29 January 2003,"William Peter Blatty adapts his own sequel to THE EXORCIST (the book was titled LEGION), completely ignoring THE HERETIC. Ironically, EXORCIST III is, in many ways, an inferior movie. Homicide detective Kinderman (George C. Scott, replacing Lee J. Cobb) is in the middle of a bizarre investigation involving priests and children being brutally murdered in the method used by a serial killer executed fifteen years earlier. The investigation leads to a psychiatric ward where a straight-jacket-bound man claims to be the killer--and bears a striking resemblance to the late Father Karras (Jason Miller), who lept to his death from the possessed girl's bedroom window in the original EXORCIST. This intriguing premise has potential, but Blatty piles on so much overwrought mumbo-jumbo that the plot collapses under its own weight. There are some good moments (a nurse being stalked and killed during the night shift stands as one of the scariest sequences in modern horror cinema), but Blatty over directs relentlessly, and even the simplest of scenes are headache-inducing. His screenplay is also a mess, with some mind-bogglingly awful dialog (the ""fish in the bathtub"" speech is one of the most bewildering and pointless examples of exposition I've ever heard) and glaring inconsistencies with the original film (and book). A couple of examples are the fact that Karras and Kinderman barely knew each other in THE EXORCIST, yet here they apparently were best friends; and in a bit of contrived dialog, a connection is made between one of young victims and the original possession, by saying that the kid's mother is the one who figured out that the demon was speaking in English in reverse. This is wrong, as in the original movie (and book) a male friend of Karras is the one who figured that out.Scott chews the scenery like a champ, Brad Dourif is effectively bizarre as the killer's ghost and Viveca Lindfors has a creepy little part as a catatonic mental patient. Zorha Lambert, on the other hand, as Kinderman's wife, gives a howlingly bad performance. The working title was LEGION, and initially it was going to be an unrelated thriller until studio execs thought it would do more business as a direct sequel. Therefore, the title was changed and some awkward (and fairly incoherent) footage was added, including scenes with Nicol Williamson as a priest who eventually performs an exorcism at the film's conclusion. The result is a jumbled train wreck of a movie, though it's developed a loyal cult following.",The Exorcist III
70,TheMarwood,A slow burn with a studio mandated ending at right angles to the whole thing,4,21 October 2014,"This is certainly an improvement over part II, though as long as Blatty kept the film in focus and didn't use the infamous synchronizer from part II, it wouldn't take much to best that hilarious disaster. This begins with some witty dialogue between George C Scott and Ed Flanders as a cop and a priest who are friends, who keep each other company each year on the day father Karras threw himself down those infamous steps. Flanders is written out pretty quickly and it becomes clear his character serves mostly as a connection to the first film and little else. The story becomes muddled when events shift to the psych ward, the pacing grinds to a halt and the tone begins to feel like a 2nd rate giallo film - minus the explicit gore. The scenes with Brad Dourif feel endless and the studio mandated exorcism ending is at complete odds to the tone and style of the film. The moment super priest Father Morning enters, it's blatantly obvious the last reel has been trashed and replaced with a goofy ending. There's some well crafted suspense and intrigue, but this is mediocre work and nobody seems more disappointed in the final product than Blatty himself.",The Exorcist III

Lt. Kinderman is keen to get on to the case to find out what is going on in Georgetown. what he finds out is shocking and not what he had been expecting.

We even laughed in the parts where they were talking just for talking. We fast-forwarded it in the parts where we realized there was nothing to see. A really scary piece of *, down there alongside Exorcist II, the Erect, or Heretic, or whatever. The exorcist series is surely one of the worst sagas of all time. A hemorroid for people who sit all the way through it and don't fall asleep. My god, it was bad! George C. Scott had no expression, he just yelled sometimes to - who knows? - wake up the audience. all the actors were bad, specially one woman who played a nurse with fingernails constantly in fornt of the camera lenses.

73,Gunnar_Runar_Ingibjargarson,"Damn good, and scary too. George C. Scott is excellent!",6,24 June 2008,"From the eerie opening dream sequence, I was drawn into this film by William Peter Blatty's great screenplay (based on his book, Legion) and confident directing. He deftly blends elements of mystery and horror together to create an atmosphere of evil that is both subtle at times and shocking at others. And just as William Friedkin did in the original Exorcist, the employment of auditory stimuli are used in a way that get under your skin and stay there. The plot revolves around Detective Bill Kinderman--played this time by the great George C. Scott--trying to solve a series of gruesome murders that seem to somehow be related to the exorcism of Regan MacNeil 17 years ago. The story is allowed to develop at a relaxed pace, and will keep you guessing as to what's happening and why. But as it continues to unfold, Kinderman's faith in God, which he admits that he doesn't have much of, and his own sanity are tested by an ungodly force that he can't begin to comprehend. Blatty takes all the things we believe in and comfort us--faith in God, religious symbols, and Good over Evil--and tries to eradicate them right in front of our eyes and make us question our own comfortable reality. Overall, there are many scenes that will bring you right out of your seat because they are so damn scary. The few parts with Kinderman interrogating the Gemini killer (Brad Dourif) are also very intense, and are a rare glimpse into the mind of a sick killer. One problem I had with the film is that the ending seemed a little too predictable and rushed, but in conclusion does not detract from the overall strength of the film that much. If you appreciate intelligent horror films (yes, there are some of them around), you should see this well-made film.",The Exorcist III

The second Exorcist film I found to be underrated, but I must admit that not everyone can enjoy such a deranged trip, it moved away from the calmed but frightening atmosphere from the original and became an insane dream. This third entry in the series goes back to its routes, the tone is much closer to the original and the movie's imagery becomes disturbing again.An interesting idea to make the third film a psychological thriller rather than an outright horror movie like the original, but it works. George C. Scott is amazing in this, such a great actor, Brad Dourif also delivers a really good performance, the man knows how to pay demented characters. The cinematography its amazing, not as breathtaking as the second one, but still great, this one doesn't bombard you with great visuals, it uses them when it needs to.As expected, this is a depressing experience, a magnificent movie, I love the filmmaking in it, the themes, the music, the characters, the visuals, the writing, an outstanding film.",The Exorcist III
80,Mr_Censored,An above average sequel that succumbs to conflict.,7,3 August 2009,"You know you're in trouble when the box-art for the movie in your hands doesn't bare any rave-review quotes or snippets. Far be it from the discriminating viewer to judge a book (or DVD) by its cover, though, because while ""The Exorcist III"" looks like a subpar sequel to a classic film, the fact of the matter is that there is more to it than meets the eye. A film that is notorious for tinkering by the producers, despite being in the hands of ""The Exorcist"" creator William Peter Blatty, this third entry in the saga has more brains than the average 80's horror film and more weight than any sequel within the genre is ever expected to hold.George C. Scott plays police lieutenant Kinderman (a character seen briefly in the first film), hardened but human, who is on the trail of a mysterious, sadistic and methodical killer who takes after the famed Gemini Killer (a take on the real-life Zodiac Killer), despite the fact that he has been dead for fifteen years. When a longtime friend in Father Dyer (Ed Flanders) emerges as the next victim, a chain of events unfolds that brings back a familiar face from the past in Father Karras (Jason Miller reprising his role from the first film). Bit by bit, what Kinderman unearths turns out to be bigger than himself and threatens his very existence.Scott is reliable and likable as always in the role of Kinderman, and while Jason Miller isn't given much to do here, it's a pleasure to see him again. Brad Dourif, best known as Chucky in the ""Child's Play"" series, is the wild-card of the film and nearly threatens to steal the show in one of his most intense performances. The script, based off the Blatty's novel, ""Legion,"" is hardly a re-hash of the first film, and compared to other sequels from its era, is quite a refreshing change of pace as an intelligent and classy picture in its own right. The gore and special effects are kept to a minimum, as the movie is just as much about its characters and dialogue as it is about its horrors. The film's not without its faults, of course. Take the tacked-on ending that reeks of studio interference, for example. Blatty's battles with producer James G. Robinson (who had nothing to do with the original film in the first place) result in an intelligent horror movie/sequel that simply doesn't know how to end itself. It's as if someone was standing there saying: ""This is fine and all, but we need an exorcism scene!"" and voila! While it results in a rather gruesome and exciting special effects opportunity, the man-sticking-to-the-ceiling bit feels out of place with the tone of the rest of the film, which for the most part, keeps things cerebral and tasteful. This little bit felt like something you'd see in a ""Hellraiser"" flick, not that there's anything wrong with that. As for Patrick Ewing playing the Angel of Death in a dream sequence? Don't even get me started. Heck, even an appearance by Fabio seems bound and determined to rain on a decent parade.In the end, ""The Exorcist III"" is a solid sequel that falls short of greatness. Its creativity and inventiveness is undermined by the insistence on re-introducing elements from the original film for nothing other than keeping with the namesake. Fans who felt themselves left in the cold by ""The Exorcist II"" will find this a treat, as will anyone else who loves an intelligent horror/thriller. Despite its flaws and the fact that it effectively killed off the franchise (was it ever meant to be?) ""The Exorcist III"" is as close to greatness as any of the sequels or prequels gets to the original.",The Exorcist III

84,LanceBrave,"Startling, Unnerving Sights",7,22 March 2015,"After the disastrous reception that greeted ""Exorcist II: The Heretic,"" you would expect no further attempts to franchise ""The Exorcist"" brand name. Why not let a classic film stand on its' own? That was the general belief until original series creator William Peter Blatty had an idea. In the mid-eighties, Blatty thought a concept for an ""Exorcist"" sequel, revolving around Kinderman, the detective from the original story. Published as the novel ""Legion,"" the box was a best seller. Naturally, Hollywood demanded a film adaptation, expanding the ""Exorcist"" series into a trilogy. After William Friedkin and John Carpenter passed on directing the film, Blatty himself took up the job. ""The Exorcist III"" had a troubled production and mediocre box office but has developed a cult following over the year.""The Exorcist III"" does not go for the bold shock value of the original film. Instead, it is more interested in creating a creeping sense of unease. The film begins with an extraordinary dream sequence, a point-of-view shot walking down a street, passing the first murder victim. The door of a church blows open, accompanied by diabolic cackling on the soundtrack, forcing the eyes of a crucifix open. The camera then crash-cuts to Karras rolling down the stairs. There are many moments of slow-building dread. A confession at a church begins calmly enough before escalating to screaming, murdered priest. Sometimes, the film punctuates these sequences with a strong jump scare. Kinderman wanders a dark, suddenly foreboding church. The face on a statue of a saint is suddenly replaced with a sadistic grin. Suddenly, a girl bumps into the detective, deflating the tension. The most famous moment, probably, in ""Exorcist III"" involves a long shot of a nurse doing her nightly duties which ends suddenly with a killer, clad in white and carrying a giant pair of sheers, entering to decapitate her. Moreover, the movie is just creepy, with a fabulously sinister sound design, frequently powered by unearthly growls. The image of an old woman scurrying across the ceiling or a sudden, near decapitation are startling, unnerving sights.Centering ""The Exorcist III"" is a powerful performance from George C. Scott. Lee J. Cobb, who played Kinderman in the original movie, had passed away, forcing recasting. It's just as well because Scott's Kinderman is practically a different character. The whimsical Kinderman who digs information out of people with double-talk isn't seen much here. Instead, Kinderman has suffered many losses and will suffer more before this is over. Blatty retcons his own work a little. In ""The Exorcist,"" Karras and Kinderman only knew each other a short while. In this film, the two are characterized as best friends. This change, however, allows the character to be far more invested in the story. George C. Scott gives a fantastic performance. His face is world-weary and his words are usually blustery. He's a man who has experienced a lot so, when he breaks down in tears at one point, you know it's serious. Scott gets two fabulous monologues to himself. The first describes his wife keeping a carp in their bathtub, a bizarre bit of quasi-comic dialogue only Blatty could have written. The second one is a powerful speech near the end of the film where Kinderman establishes his belief in evil. That is the true climax of the film and a great moment.Much of ""The Exorcist III"" is devoted to Kinderman's discussion with the mysterious man in Cell 31. He is credited only as Patient X. A really interesting choice has two actors playing the part. Sometimes, Jason Miller plays the part, confirming the character as the revived corpse of Damian Karras. Other times, more frequently, Brad Dourif plays the madman. Dourif brings the strangled, coldly sadistic, slightly refined, and deeply unhinged style to the part that we expect from him. Even then, Dourif's voice constantly changes, rising and falling in pitch. The demon truly is legion, a multitude of wicked personalities always shifting around inside. The film's supporting cast is generally great. Ed Flanders has fine chemistry with Scott as the recast Father Dyer and Zohra Lampert and Nicol Williamson feel out the supporting case.The original ""Exorcist"" was a story about faith and guilt. The third film continues in a similar pattern but with a slightly different approach. Kinderman's guilt comes from loosing dear friends, from the thought that he failed them. His faith has wavered because of how much evil he has seen. The gruesome details of the murders weigh heavily on him. The story revolves these issues through two ways. By acknowledging the existence of the demon, of supernatural evil, it justifies the existence of a higher power, of supernatural goodness. Secondly, Kinderman is able to literally resolve his friend's untimely passing. He has to confront Karras' death and viscerally move pass it at one time. The final image of ""The Exorcist III"" is the cop standing above his dear friend's grave, finally at rest. Though not as powerful as the themes addressed in the first film, the movie handles its own ideas with a similar complexity and skill.""The Exorcist III"" was originally an even more low-key production before Morgan Creek demanded reshoots. Specifically, they were convinced an ""Exorcist"" movie couldn't happen with an exorcism. So a new subplot, about a priest going to exorcise Patient X, was hastily added. The sequence also contains most of the gore and special effects seen in the film. They are mildly effective but obviously last minute additions. William Peter Blaty has expressed a desire to create a director's cut but Morgan Creek hasn't been interested in cooperating. Perhaps his vision of the film would be a smoother affair. Even in its theatrical cut, ""The Exorcist III"" is still a pretty good movie. It doesn't attempt to recreate the shocks of the original, instead doing something very different, providing some worthy chills of its own.",The Exorcist III
85,kevin_crighton,"Intelligent, scary horror.",10,27 June 2007,"Horror movies recently have lost their way. The film-makers seem to think violent, bloody horror is the way to go. However as was proved by Ringu you can scare the hell out of people without resorting to this. And if more proof was needed they need only look at The Exorcist III. It's simply one of the scariest movies I've ever seen.Made by William Peter Blatty and based on his novel Leigon, it follows Detective Kinderman hunting down a serial killer in Georgetown, and how it ties in with an Exorcism carried out years earlier, and may find the truth in a patient locked up in a mental ward..one that looks familiar......The performances are all first rate, but special mention had to be made of George C Scott as Kinderman trying to comprehend the horror unfolding in the city, Jason Miller who appears as patient X in a small role, but especially Brad Dourif as a man claiming to be a killer who supposedly died years before. The scenes in the asylum cell between Kinderman and the Dourif Gemini killer character are stunning. The unsettling atmosphere throughout the movie is really evident here, and the scene where Gemini unleashes his anger at Kinderman is brilliant.This is a movie that has a genuinely creepy atmosphere running through it, both in small scenes like a character running down a dark hall.. watch the statue figure here. It's creepy! But if you want shocking and scary, then one scene stands out. I won't go into detail for those that have yet to see it, but the hospital corridor sequence is absolutely brilliant. No music, long shots, no dialogue and little sounds pay off with a scary as hell sequence. When I saw this when it first came out there were screams in the audience, and even now this scene still shocks. It goes to show if done right, horror movies don't need to show gore and violence.In fact in this movie most of the violence takes place off-screen. It's either implied or described but not shown, which makes it even more unsettling.There is a lot of criticism about the actual exorcism in the movie. The scenes with Nicol Williamson do seem tacked on as an afterthought (his character doesn't even interact with anyone else till the end). And some parts of the scene don't work, like the snakes and the figures coming through the floor, but on the whole I was okay with it. I've read that the producers insisted on adding an exorcism to the movie, whereas the book and original cut of the movie (so I've heard) didn't have one. You do get that feeling watching it, but it doesn't totally unbalance the movie, and you do get a wonderful speech from Kinderman during the scene about belief.Overall though this movie stands above the crowd of horror movies as both a brilliant follow-up to The Exorcist (it ignores Exorcist II-The Heretic altogether) and being genuinely frightening. Personally I like it more that the original.After recent debacles on the horror genre it's been wonderful to go back and revisit this movie again and get scared again.",The Exorcist III

87,RickHarvey,Exorcist 2 ( forget about that awful 1970s sequel),7,1 November 2012,"The story is pleasingly back in the hands of the man who started it all. Exorcist 3, beautifully directed by Blatty himself, can be ranked not too far below the original.Set 15 years after the events in Washington, Exorcist 3 focuses on a series of crime which have been gruesomely inflicted upon associates close to Detective Kinderman. The Motive is uncertain and not an inkling if suspicious in put on anyone.Kinderman, while not a major character in the original film (though in the novel he is.) has the leading narrative in the film. George.C.Scott doesn't let us down with overtaking Lee.J.Cobb's role on playing Kinderman.Whereas The Exorcist 2 focused on the demon still inside Reagan, portraying a different sense of evil, Exorcist 3 goes back to the films old root and dives back into the mystery of possession and how Good can Challenge evil's dominance.With Blatty at the reins, both with the pen and camera, Exorcist 3 Is the true sequel to the one of the greatest horror story told. The film's focus on the demon which terrorised Georgetown many years back doesn't start until the latter half of the film. Before all that though, the audience is taken on a stimulating ride on belief, personal torment and grief as Kinderman (along with Father Dyer) desperately tries to comprehend the events which happened on those years back.At times, you don't realise you're watching a horror, with the character driven story and the slow build up. But nonetheless, Blatty has a knack on making any scene spooky. The church scene has a mystical flair to it and the dream sequence leaves you dreading the turn of the events which inevitably happen afterwards. And then there's one or two scenes which catch you off guard.If you were worried about the quality of storytelling after watching the dreadful Exorcist 2, then let me say, have no fear, this film delivers, along with Brad Dourif supporting role.",The Exorcist III
88,counterrevolutionary,Better than EXORCIST II,4,8 September 2003,"Of course, a two-hour film of paint drying would be better than EXORCIST II. EXORCIST III is better than a two-hour film of paint drying...marginally.There are a few nice moments; the carp stuff is cute, and there are a couple of good eerie shots in the hospital. But ultimately, the movie collapses under the weight of a ludicrous and muddled plot, fairly awful performances (for which I blame the director; Scott would surely have done better if left to himself), and poor dialogue (notably Dourif's interminable monologue about how he possessed Karras's body, which could have been cut down to about five lines and been much more effective).And speaking of Dourif, he should have been fired. Not for anything he did, but because once the studio had made its last-second decision to bring back Jason Miller, Dourif was superfluous. The character has Karras's body, it looks like Karras, why do we keep switching back and forth from Dourif to Miller to Dourif? Instead of rewriting the script, Blatty should have reshot all of Dourif's scenes with Miller in the role.But I'm not sure how clearly Blatty was thinking while making this film (having never read LEGION, I'm not sure whether this logical slip occurs in the novel). Blatty uses the old trick of having the cops give out false details about crimes in order to distinguish a real confession from a false one. Kinderman comes to believe that current murders are being committed by the dead Gemini Killer because the killings have the look of the real Gemini murders, not the fake details which were printed in the papers.However, we have already been informed that the Gemini Killer was executed. So the real details of the killings (which involve the mutilation of the bodies) would have come out in the trial. Remember the coroner in the OJ Simpson trial testifying in detail as to the condition of the bodies? Same deal.So all a copycat killer would have had to do is read the trial transcripts--or even the news reports about the trial.Blatty's final mistake (apart from making this film at all, of course) was to abandon the traditional, coherent Catholic theology which gave the original EXORCIST its extraordinary depth and power for a weird plot about one dead person possessing the body of another dead person (who apparently wasn't quite dead, because his soul is still inside his body, but who was dead enough that it took the first dead person [the one possessing, not the one possessed] fifteen years to repair the damage to his [the possessed person's] brain).I am not looking forward to EXORCIST IV.4/10",The Exorcist III

So no I'm afraid, it is not intellectual at all.I liked the slow pase, and the creepiness of the scenes but it got very old after the first hour. Then all sorts of weird action starts literally in the last 10 minutes.As a story/novel it would probably be very interesting to read, but as a movie it is badly edited and slow that it becomes boring.

Then a grisly string of murders he investigates seems strangely connected with a case he worked several years previously. The culprit was the Gemini Killer, and Kinderman is informed that a patient in the psychiatric ward of the local hospital is claiming responsibility for the crimes. The detective decides to confront the patient, but he knows it's impossible for this person to be the Gemini - the murderer was executed in the electric chair - on the very night that Father Karras successfully expelled the demon in the first film.Kinderman is in no way prepared for what he is about to face - evil wearing the face of his old friend, the priest's soul being tormented for the devil's pleasure - and a bloody rampage that claims the life of another friend, Father Joesph Dyer (Ed Flanders, RIP). Braving the supernatural force, the detective must face his worst foe to end the crime spree and free his friend's soul . . . . . .Blatty wisely did not try to top his original masterpiece; instead, he presents a portrait of a few of his key characters engaged in their own battles and trying to contemplate the meaning of life and death in general, all the while incorporated the supernatural to reach the point. The movie seems to have a more significant meaning since many of the top billed cast members have now passed on. Understandably, the film did not do well at the box office due to the previous sequel's disaster, but LEGION is an underrated gem. If you have seen the first film, you might like to see this one. Try to remember that it became before ""The Silence Of The Lambs"".",The Exorcist III
91,AlabamaWorley1971,"Chilling, elegant, intelligent, excellent",9,8 February 1999,"I love this movie! It is much better than LEGION, the book, which is an interesting character study of Kinderman but lacking on things like plot, suspense, and so forth. This film takes the best of the novel, and also the funniest dialogue that didn't make it into THE EXORCIST! My favorite scenes: the Gemini Killer (Brad Dourif) describing a murder while straitjacketed and strapped down, using only his eyes and face; and the scene in the hallway.",The Exorcist III
92,irishboy141,"Flawed, but great.",9,9 July 2019,"I really liked this film more than most people do. Of course it doesn't reach the same level of excellence as the original The Exorcist (arguably nothing has), But at the very least it's a worthy sequel unlike the 2nd film or the terrible prequels.This film is held up by several aspects;The ActingGeorge C. Scott is incredible as Kinderman, he really chews the scenery and shows his range as a master actor. Plus his dynamic with Father Dyer (played by Ed Flanders) is really sweet and hilarious.Brad Dourif is amazing as the Gemini Killer, his crackling evil voice and fantastic facial acting sends chills down my spine.DirectionWilliam Peter Blatty directed this film really well, with interesting camera work, excellent sequences that build atmosphere, and really creepy visuals.WritingThe writing is fantastic and surprisingly funny throughout the film, the dialogue is great, the character dynamics are wonderful, and the pacing is very nice. It's simply a great story.
I admit that there are several flaws such as the last act, the exorcism feels really shoehorned in, but it is visually interesting at least.This is a flawed masterpiece that has no right being as good as it is.",The Exorcist III
93,Embley,Creepy moments don't quite make up for crappy film,4,14 May 2000,"There are several very effective scary parts of this film.  The old lady, the white figure...  When I saw this film in the theatre when it came out someone started screaming during a particularly tense moment.
Unfortunately the film doesn't hold up too well over time.  It looks pretty dated and the creepy bits, while still very eerie, do not make it worth sitting through all the tedious boring parts.George C. Scott is pretty good though.  And that has to be the voice of Colleen Dewhurst as the demon, no one had a voice like she did, but she doesn't seem to be credited anywhere.  Am I hallucinating?",The Exorcist III
94,Lando_Hass,"Just like part 2, it doesnt cut the mustard...or cheese, whichever sounds better...",5,1 September 2003,"Exorcist III starts out very promising, with good acting, a somewhat original plot (that never actually is clear), and good suspense. But, occasionally, like some good movies, it has to end by one small, but effective flaw. I've seen Exorcist 1, and it was a brilliantly written, frightening masterpiece. A good film. I then saw part II, which turned out to be one of the worst movies of all time because everything from the first film was absent. The only thing that remained was the main star, Linda Blair. So, last Christmas, I saw this on DVD for $6.00. If I see a DVD that has a chance of being good for six bucks, I'll buy it. So, I did, and now, a few months after, I finally take a look at it. Like I said, the movie looked promising from the trailer, and it starts off good, but crumbles when it reaches the second half. Brad Dourif (known for his voice over work as Chucky, from Child's Play), plays as a mental patient who claims that he is responsible for recent murders. Brad Dourif gives a good performance, and delivers his lines well, as does the rest of the cast, whom each are helped out by a good script. There's nothing wrong with the acting, or script, it's the movie itself. It's filled with nonsensical and mindless jabbering from Dourif's character, and the occasional meaningless ramble. The movie itself never really does have a plot, though it has a few semi-chilling moments, such as the scene where the old lady crawls on the ceiling like a bug, but that's about all. The movie is nothing like the original, even though it was written and directed by the man who wrote the first film (William Peter Blatty). This film really isn't that good, and his has virtually nothing to do with exorcism. The film would have been good if half of it wasn't wasted by mindless speeches from Dourif's character. Exorcist III has potential, but it was all put to waste, and was thrown and flushed down the toilet. The upcoming part four has achance for redemption, but if it fails, the series will be permanently dead.Score: 4 ½ out of 10.",The Exorcist III
95,mindcat,Slow moving until near the end,7,17 June 2008,"I have to say this flick could have been done a little better, but when I saw it through the second time, I realized how the characters were chosen not so much to be believable, but to be scary.Scott as always did a tremendous job, but way way to old to be believable as a father with mother living and young daughter. Also cops retire at 50-55, mandatory.None the less, his choice for the role, I believe was excellent as long as you didn't think this was intended as something that actually could happen.My very favorite scene is the old woman, transformed into some sort of creature that walked across the ceiling. Other special effects were great also.So over all I bought this for 6.00 dollar DVD close out. How could I complain.

96,mf2812,The most underrated horror movie ever?,10,16 February 2019,"Yep, in my opinion this is up there. After the flop that was The Exorcist 2, this one comes flying out the box. It possesses a pure dread emotion that not many movies do nowadays.George C. Scott is excellent in his portrayal of Bill Kindermam and the to and fro's between himself and Ed Flanders is spot on. You really get the feeling these guys are best friends.There are a few continuity errors regarding how close Bill was to Damien as they really never got to know each other in the first so the line ""he was my best friend, I loved him"" goes straight out the door.However, to me, this is the true sequel to the original and should be viewed back-to-back.Excellent!",The Exorcist III
97,Beard_Of_Serpico,Who would've thought this would be good? It is!!,8,25 June 2021,"The original Exorcist movie is a classic but the sequel is a disaster. It's borderline unwatchable so i avoided The Exorcist 3 for a long time. I think being associated with the Exorcist effects people's perceptions of this movie and it should not have been called Exorcist 3. It should have been called ""Legion"" so it could stand on it's own merits.Thanks to Red Letter Media for recommending it, it looked great so i got the Blu Ray.This is more of a detective story than a horror although it is a very dark and disturbing detective movie.Veteran actor George C Scott is a class act and the interactions and dialogue between him and his best friend father Dyer played by Ed Flanders are natural and hilarious, i love those scenes. They really feel like they are best friends, it's excellent stuff.Brad Dourif as the Gemini killer is beyond awesome, he's so intense that i'm surprised he didn't give himself a nose bleed while delivering his lines. His evil rants are legit intimidating and scary. I don't know if he got any awards for his role but he should have.The movie is mostly a slow burn but it's so well made it doesn't get boring at all and the final scenes are explosive and memorable.This is a great movie and definitely underrated.",The Exorcist III
98,raegan_butcher,should be called LEGION,10,27 May 2006,"This is one of the best horror films in the last twenty years. I once heard it remarked that director William Peter Blatty directs like David Lynch--but with a tighter pace! Not a bad estimation, I'd say. I have a theory this film would actually have had a chance to be a hit if it had been allowed to go out to theaters under its proper title: LEGION, just like the novel its taken from. But some genius at the studios must've insisted that by tying it to the Exorcist label it would draw an audience; well, we all know how that turned out( for those of you who don't: this film tanked at the BO and quickly disappeared, to be completely eclipsed by the far inferior SILENCE OF THE LAMBS a scant 8 months later!) People who went to this didn't expect a supernatural serial killer mystery--indeed this was the best of the ""executed killers return from the grave to wreak destruction"" movies that popped up suddenly in the late 80's with films like SHOCKER and THE FIRST POWER(something that would turn up with even more regularity a few yrs later on the X-files, Brad Dourif even plays an almost identical character in the episode ""BEyond the SEA"" as he plays here in Exocist III) but in 1990 people who went to see Exorcist III were probably expecting something else;as far as i can tell, though, this movie is a pretty decent piece of work. It's sad to think that almost all of the actor's who were in this film--GEorge C Scott, Ed Flanders, Jason Miller-- are no longer with us. but at least we've still got Brad Dourif!!",The Exorcist III
99,elisereid-29666,Stops short of its incredible potential,8,17 January 2021,"Two-thirds of the way through this movie, I was all set to give it a ten star rating and a glowing review, but then something happened. The movie went from being psychological and thrilling to silly and convoluted. I left The Exorcist III feeling ripped off, because I was *so* with the movie up to that point.Of course, I was not surprised in the slightest, upon looking up the film on the IMDb after it was over, to learn that it had been meddled with in post-production. This explains a whole lot. I've always been of the opinion that you can make a good movie out of mediocre footage in the editing stage, but you can also make a terrible movie out of fantastic footage. Is this a terrible movie? No, it isn't, and I would recommend it for those who want to know what became of the characters after the end of the first Exorcist (don't get me started on the second one! Skip it).Another flaw is that the characters are not given much time to develop, so we feel little weight from the drama. We feel that very little is at stake from the events of the film. And what weight the film did have, came from being familiar with the original movie, so anybody walking into this movie without having seen the first one (unlikely, but bear with me) will be totally mystified.The movie is a mess, but it's something of a glorious mess that is probably worth seeing at least once, and it's a shining example of how a film can be ruined by test audiences.",The Exorcist III
100,johnm_001,Underrated Gem!,10,9 October 2000,"Better than the original?!  Well, that's a matter of opinion, and my opinion is, yes.  At least I like it better than its famous predecessor.  This is the true sequel to ""The Exorcist"" (forget part II, which has a good performance by Linda Blair, but that's all).  Written and directed by William Peter Blatty (the original's author), this film takes on a completely different tone.  It is very creepy.  George C.

The main characters had impeccable performances and the direction was perfect and obviously the writing was clearly the best part and it was clear better than even the first movie which should not surprise people because this movie is a more true creation of the book writer.",The Exorcist III
103,veganflimgeek,"Not to be compared with the orginal,but excellent horror film",8,19 January 2004,"Exorcist IIIExorcist III is the only true sequel to the original exorcist. It is the one that Blatty set up at the end of the first Exorcist novel and in the scenes left on the cutting room of the first Exorcist. Legion is perhaps a better title but it was fair to connect the films. Indeed Exorcist III is largely a film about the demons that posses Father Karas after the events of the first film. Karas made a Sacrifice he said take me and through himself out the window. Would the devil be so easy to defeat?For a director with so few credits as Blatty he pulled off a high quality horror film on a limited budget. Morgan creek as a studio has shown itself to be really stupid in how they handle films(nightbreed, and the exorcist prequel where they fired the man who wrote Taxi driver!). The decision is add the Exorcism at the end is a tad bit forced indeed but doesn't hurt the overall effect to much.Something that has always bothered me about this film is George C. Scott. Something about his performance is just stiff and weird. However the actor who plays Gemini knocks the ball out of the park. He did so well years later the X-files had him almost repeat the performance in a episode.
While the first exorcist is a great film I see it as more of a drama than a horror film. Of course it is scary if you put yourself in reagan's mom shoes. The film however almost requires a belief in catholism to make it a over the top horror film. Father Karas loss of faith and eventual sacrifice is what makes the first film great not so much as a fright fest.
Exorcist III however is a horror film. Dark, foreboding  and nightmarish Exorcist III is worth a watch just don't expect the same kind of drama as the original. This a is a horror film.",The Exorcist III
104,dav07dan02,I cannot say enough about this exceptional movie. A must for any horror collection!,10,25 May 2006,"Director/Script(From his novel Legion): William Peter Blatty, Cast: George C. Scott (William Kinderman), Ed Flanders (Father Joseph K. Dyer), Nancy Fish (Nurse Allerton), Jason Miller (Patient X aka. Father Damien Karras), Brad Dourif (Gemini Killer/James Venamun), Scott Wilson (Dr. Temple), Nicol Williamson (Father Paul Morning)This is the 1990 film adaption of Blatty's novel Legion. Ignoring the lousy 'Exorcist 2' this film takes place fifteen years after the events of the first film. This is the true sequel to The Exorcist. Three of the characters from the first film are also in this one. Detective Kinderman (played by Lee Cobb in the original now played by George C Scott), Father Dyer (Played by Rev. William O. Malley in the original now played by Ed Flanders), and Father Damien Karras (Jason Miller).At the end of the original film, Father Karras 'dies' by either jumping or being forced out the window and down the stars after assisting with the exorcism of Reagan. As it turns out, he didn't actually die. During what should have been his death, his body becomes possessed by the spirit of the Gemini Killer as a way for Satan to seek torment on Father Karras for performing the exorcism on Reagan. This movie starts out with Dective Kinderman meting Father Dyer on the 15th anniversary of Father Karras's death(He is presumed dead) for a showing of It's a Wonderful Life. Kinderman is investigating a series of deaths that horrifically resemble the work of the Gemini Killer who had been executed fifteen years earlier. The victims are decapitated and their heads replaced with one from a statue of Christ. Sometimes entire organs are removed and replaced with religious artifacts such as rosaries. What is troubling is that the murders are being executed in ways only the Gemini Killer would have known. Dective Kinderman is eventually to discover that is old friend Father Karras is in a psychiatric ward and appearers to be possessed by the Genini Killer.This film represents one of those rare cases where a sequel is equal or even better than the original film. The problem with so many sequels especially with horror movies is that it is hard to create the same kind of atmosphere the second time around. This is not at all the case here. Blatty was able to create the same gloomy atmosphere. Like the original, this movie is filmed in the Georgetown section of Washington, DC. The characterization is also excellent in this film. As good as in the first. I like George C. Scott and Lee Cobb about equally well as Detectve Kinderman. This movie is more plot driven and less special effects driven than the original. The first film relied too much on sensationalism at times to get it point across. This film is an 'intellictual' horror film. One had to follow the story to be scared by it. But what an effect it has! Especially if you believe in heaven and hell, good and evil. I sure do.William Peter Blatty wanted this film to be called Legion after his novel and this film was to have no exorcisms in it. Unfortunately, the studio made him include an exorcism and call the film 'The Exorcist 3' to cash in on the Exorcist name. The exorcism at the end of the film was a weak point in the film and I will tell you why. To do an exorcism once again uses it too casually. In reality, the Catholic church really performs exorcisms. Few priests are even qualified to do it. Exorcism are only performed under extremely rare circumstances and they have to be approved by at least the bishop. A priest cannot routinely perform an exorcism. That aside, it just added unnecessary sensationalism to the film. Otherwise this is a great film and one of my all time favorite horror films. This is a truly underrated work. I am really hoping for a special edition directors cut of this to come out.",The Exorcist III
105,A_Roode,A crazy thought: Is this the best of the entire series?,9,5 November 2006,"'Exorcist 3' is one of my favourite horror films. I prefer it to the other four films in the 'Exorcist' series (I include 'Dominion') and, shock of shocks, I think it is the scariest. Superior in every possible way to 'Exorcist 2,' it is William Peter Blatty's TRUE sequel to 'The Exorcist.' Watching one right after the other is optimal since 'Exorcist 3' does assume that you have seen and understood the first film.That George C Scott was nominated for a Golden Raspberry Award is completely laughable and a sure sign that the Raspberry committee is far less clever than they think they are. Keep in mind that 'Exorcist 3' had three major things working against it when it was released:1. The legacy of 'The Exorcist' which is still rightly viewed as a landmark of the horror genre (whether or not it is still scary for a more contemporary audience is another matter) 2. The legacy of 'The Exorcist 2.' The sequel was such an hilarious disappointment that it inflicted terrible damage to the credibility of the entire series. Fans who might have given part three a chance had already walked away from the series. 3. 'Reposessed' the Linda Blair 'Exorcist' spoof had been released just prior to 'Exorcist 3.' It sent up the entire series and harmed the chances of a genuinely intense and rewarding horror film.There are scenes in 'Exorcist 3' which have haunted me for years. Very few horror films do that. The scene with the night nurse checking rooms is one of the scariest things I've ever seen on film. Or how about the ceiling walker? Or how about the nurse at George C Scott's home?Brad Dourif very nearly steals this movie and I wonder how the role and his performance would have been looked at if there had been no 'Exorcist 2' and if 'Exorcist 3' had come out a year earlier than 'Reposessed'? I was mesmerized by him every time he was on the screen and he has a very long and difficult speech in the middle of the film. It is a masterful piece of acting and the intensity is incredible. The anger and the power within him slowly crescendos and just as it pushes George C Scott's back to the wall in the cell, I defy an honest viewer not to be pushed away from the screen as Dourif looms into it, closer and closer, slashing a simulated knife back and forth and raging out his dialogue with lines that tremble just short of yelling. Dourif has been largely under-rated after early success in movies like 'One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest,' and 'Ragtime.' His work here is among the best he's ever put in and nobody has watched the film or taken it seriously. Dourif suffered a terrible injustice by not being more widely recognized for his performance here. I can not praise him highly enough and I hope that some of his more recent success with projects like 'Deadwood' will send fans back to earlier examples of his work.George C Scott is another favourite of mine and I really love what he does in this film. Scott can fairly be accused of often looking like he was impatient on screen and tolerating another actor's lines only so that he could deliver his next brilliant speech. I loved him for it though and have enjoyed every performance of his that I've seen. That he is accused of poor acting here is truly mind boggling. Consider the scene where he comes to the hospital to visit the sickly Father Dyer. He begins with a calm tone that slowly becomes more agitated with each line. He is believable and true. He is concerned and worried about his friend. When he yells ""WE'RE FINE!"" at the nurse, it isn't because George C Scott the actor is blowing the scene. It is because Kinderman the character can't hide his stress and concern any longer. The same goes for later on when he realizes, in a panic, that he needs to get home FAST. I love the way he behaves as the passenger in the squad car. This is the face of desperation and Scott was absolutely correct in how he played it.Studio interference with the Nicol Williamson infused exorcism are the only flaws in what is otherwise a very good horror/supernatural thriller. Scott and Dourif are both excellent and in a very limited role, so is Jason Miller. It has two scary moments that I will remember forever and it is a much better film than people give it credit for being. This film deserves much better than it has gotten and I've rarely shown it to anyone who hasn't liked it. Much under-rated and highly deserving of a second chance.",The Exorcist III

But I try to give a film a second chance and rewatched it years later. My opinion actually worsened as I started to actually listen to the horrible dialogue and examine more closely the absolutely silly performances, with exception of George C. Scott who tries to retain some degree of dignity. Forget all the other Exorcist films and just allow this to work on its own merits. It fails on all levels. It is a horror film with no horror and a thriller with no thrills. It was only until recently that I heard that there were reshoots when the studio was disappointed with the cut director William Peter Blatty delivered and ordered that an exorcism be thrown in. It is among the laugh out loud moments throughout the film and had me rolling my eyes on the first viewing, especially the dream sequence. Blatty is a poor director and equally bad at writing dialogue. It is meant to sound clever and witty but it is actually unnatural and obnoxious. The scenes between Scott's Kinderman and Brad Dourif's Gemini Killer could have been quite interesting had they been written and acting better. Whenever I see Brad Dourif I cannot help but see Billy Bibbitt from One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest. He is not the least bit scary or intimidating. But he is made to read some pretty cringe-worthy dialogue. The bum that Karras sees in the subway in The Exorcist is far more creepy than Dourif. Everyone q dialed up to eleven and seem to be having a competition to see who can eat the most scenery.The story, such as it is, has an evil force stalking the streets and churches of Georgetown. A young boy is killed and bears the mark of the supposedly long dead Gemini Killer. It is around the anniversary of the events of the original film, where Damian Karras sacrificed himself to save young Regan McNeil from the clutches of a demonic force. In the course of his investigation Kinderman is confronted by a man known only as Patient X who claims to be the Gemini Killer, but also Karras is among the damned. More killings occur but it all adds up to very little. The final exorcism comes out of nowhere and is laughably staged. I enjoy the original film but believe it is far from the ""scariest film ever made"" but you coyld tell that an experienced director was behind the camera. Blatty made only one film previous to this titled The Final Conflagration . It was unwatchable. I tried twice to get through it but failed to make it even an hour in before turning it off. The dialogue and performances were excruciating. In interviews Blatty comes across as a bombastic twit who thinks that he reinvented the wheel with The Exorcist. It's good but far from great. After the embarrassment that was The Heretic he felt obliged to save his creation. Perhaps a more talented director might have saved this.",The Exorcist III

All of the loose ends of the first film, (and second, in some ways), are completely wrapped up, thankfully by the EXACT same director/writer as the original Exorcist.This film DOES take a while to get up and running, but if you've seen the first film(s), you should've seen that coming and should've probably taken some energy gum to help yourself with handling that.Anyway, this puts a terrific ending to the trilogy, and will also be one of the scariest, most memorable films that William Petter Blatty has ever made.",The Exorcist III
112,larrysmile1,Horror movies are for those who like them,7,2 April 2002,"I have seen portions of this movie twice on cable TV.  Some critics expect an epic film the magnitude of The Ten Commandments.  However, this is ""just"" a working picture in the ""scary genre.""George C. Scott and all the many cast players, including the uncredited actors, have to work somehow.  If they are criticized for working for pay because one does not like the movie story, don't blame it on the actors. All in all, the role called for a main character as a police detective to be an ""in your face"" sort of character.  Mr. Scott did perform this role very well.  So, he was the right choice and interesting choice.  The film producers got what they paid for -- a ""Patton-type"" police lieutenant.We all know the type of horror story anything called The Exorcist (part whatever) has to offer.  The trick is telling the story differently from those that preceded it.  In this case, using the hospital scene and the dying of priests and hospital workers was different.To be an actor requires one to be engaged in the profession.  Making one movie and then fading out of sight can't be called career acting.  So, this reviewer recognized the working talents of Colleen Dewhurst as the uncredited voice of Satan, Larry King and Dr. C. Everett Koop as celebrity guests, Samuel L. Jackson as the dream sequence blind man, Harry Carey Jr., as a priest, Zohra Lampert as Lt. Kinderman's wife, Viveca Lindfors as Nurse X, and Ed Flanders as a priest.

Detective Kinderman,George C Scott,is on the trail of a killer who is using the MO of another killer called the Gemini killer.The problem facing detective Kinderman,and the audience,is that the original killer had been caught and executed 15 years earlier.While being a detective film this is also a movie about Kindermans attempt to regain his faith in the face of the horrors he encounters in his job. This isn't your typical horror film as all the murders are done off screen and you never see the victims.The closest you get to the brutality of the murders is a message written in blood on the wall above the bed of one the victims. Nicol Williamsons role is the only thing that seems out of place in this movie as it does appear to have been added as an afterthought but hey I digress.

To my pleasant surprise this movie turned out to be the movie Part II should have been.A serial killer is on the loose in Georgetown, killing his victims in excruciatingly unpleasant manners. He seems bent on making his victims suffer long and painful death. Dt. Kinderman (played by Lee J. Cobb in the original, played here by George C. Scott) investigates and finds out this may be the exact same killer that ran rampant during the time of the first exorcism. Although almost no gore visible in this, at times, extremely suspenseful thriller, the murders, and the way executed, are described to you in horrific detail, making you cringe in seat. Hearing this, you'll be thankful it wasn't shown in full technicolor (unless you're a sick mind). The scenes with the murders are tense, with photography, editing and sound effects that create an effectively eerie and unpleasant atmosphere. For example, the scene in the mental hospital, in which the camera holds still as it watches a nurse work, has you relaxing for nearly five minutes, before...As mentioned, the photography, editing and sound effects are wonderful, but so is the acting. The screenplay is full with moments that will creep you out, as well as intelligent and sometimes very funny dialogue, which is no surprise, as writer of The Exorcist, William Peter Blatty, wrote the screenplay after his own novel and also directed this movie.
My only complaint is the second half of the movie, where the suspense and the pace of the movie almost comes to a screeching halt with Kinderman having to much dialogue exchange with the ""possessed psychopath"" in a dark, murky cell. And i won't even mention the ridiculous ending.

From start to end Blatty heaps on the dread and portent, while Dourif delivers grief stricken venom to make hairs stand. There's a bit of silliness (and a hastily reconstructed ending after studio interference) but for the most part this is a horrific and sobering look at the nature of evil and how rationality fails in the face of it.
There aren't too many horror movies that attempt to offer any reasoned analysis, and although Blatty fails to escape his own boxed cleverness it's a brave and unique challenge for which he should be commended.",The Exorcist III

I think it is a hugely underrated flick that when seen in the right conditions is incredibly effective.

I can't think of any main characters who did a good job acting, or maybe it was the writing. Yeah, I blame the writing. Very familiar faces from the 90's abound, but George C. Scott completely missed Lee J. Cobb's stellar performance. He should have watched the original film, which I'm guessing he didn't, just to get an idea how to play the character. The film had some moments, but it never carried it through, and even the serial killer angle was so far removed from the original, and the actor from Child's Play should have refused to say the lines given in the jail cell sequence with Scott's character.

It picks up 15 years after the possession detailed in the first. We have an all star cast consisting of George C Scott, Ed Flanders, and Brad Dourif. They are at the top of their game. Particularly Scott and Dourif. A young boy is murdered in a quite disturbing manner out on a sea dock and Lt. Bill Kinderman, played wonderfully by George C Scott, sets out to investigate. The murders continue, but have stranger and stranger settings and circumstances. A priest is murdered in his confession booth. A man is murdered in his hospital room. A young lady is murdered while at her post in the same hospital. After a few dead ends for Kinderman, including but not limited to questioning a catatonic patient who is physically unable to commit the murder but whose fingerprints were found at a crime scene, Kinderman encounters a patient in the hospital's disturbed ward who closely resembles his dead friend Damien Karras. But things are not exactly as they seem.Exorcist III is everything a true horror fan could ask for. It has some extreme studio tampering which actually makes the film confusing at a few points, but these can be overlooked when you view how well acted, directed, and photographed this film is. It's absolutely beautiful. Some of the best camera-work in a film I've seen, particularly a sequence where Kinderman is dreaming. This film isn't very well known for some reason, and I was actually surprised when I saw it a video store a few years ago because I had no idea there was a 3rd exorcist.

128,hypostylin,An unsung achievement,9,24 April 2008,"Yes, the writing is highfalutin and portentous. Yes, the performances are overacted. Yes, the style is too sober and literate for fans of the demonic histrionics of the original The Exorcist.All that aside, The Exorcist III deserves its pet moniker of ""one of the most underrated horror films in the history of cinema."" Writer/director William Peter Blatty has woven a thoroughly intricate and pensive story that engages the viewer with its disturbing complexities and distinct texture. I swear Blatty was an accomplished cinematographer in a past life, because his flair for creating iconic nightmarish imagery and committing palpable mood and atmosphere to film seems natural-born.Along with Blatty's talents, the film, of course, boasts the acting chops of a cast filled with players known for both élan and intensity. George C. Scott, Brad Dourif, and Jason Miller are as great as you always expect them to be (perhaps a little too great -- again, the overacting). And Zohra Lampert, Viveca Lindfors, and Nancy Fish all give terrific supporting performances. Blatty shouldn't face any ignominy for the hopelessly silly conclusion of this film, which reminds me more of Amityville 3-D than the rest of The Exorcist III. Tremendous interference from the big cheeses at Morgan Creek yielded the blatantly tacked-on exorcism sequence at the end (Paul Schrader faced Morgan Creek's wrath to an even greater extent while directing the original cut of Exorcist: The Beginning). It takes a lot of cojones to defecate on a borderline masterpiece, but if somebody's gotta do it, leave it to the film executives.And yes, the Brad Dourif Child's Play/redheaded boy reference is a little hokey, but it's merely another sly touch in an off-kilter and unorthodox film that is already teeming with slyness.",The Exorcist III

131,aliceboy,The ONLY true inheritor to the mantle!,8,10 June 2007,"After having seen this movie countless times, I finally felt obligated to write a bit about it. I've no idea how many horror fans -- and thus fans of 'The Exorcist' -- I've talked to who saw 'Exorcist II' and were so dispirited by it that they never bothered to see this one! This is so completely regrettable as this third installment is superb. Out of the three sequels to the original, this is the sole one worthy of having been made. Perhaps not coincidentally, it is also the only sequel Blatty (the authour of the book the first one was based on) wrote as a novel...and he wrote and directed this film! The story picks up 15 years after the original (and rightly ignores whatever happened in the second film). The cop Kinderman from the first movie returns, now portrayed by the fantastically intense George C. Scott. He is our lead character this time, as the story is more like a serial-killer mystery than the straight demonic-possession of the first two. Several gruesome murders have occurred in Georgetown, and Kinderman's investigating. He finds all the murders share MO not only with each other, but with a series of killings from around the time of the first story...the perpetrator of which was caught and executed. Events lead Kinderman to a local hospital, where he's shocked by what he finds. After a handful more scares to keep you watching, everything eventually builds to a suitably horror-y (if somehow disappointing) climax that's considerably less nasty than the first, and in totally different ways. This film is dominated by Scott, of course, as his presence is always overwhelming. Brad Dourif is his typically riveting self, and serves as a perfect equal and balance to Scott (though the peculiar and seemingly random pitch-shifting of his voice is a little distracting). Jason Miller returns as Father Karras, surprisingly enough, and is just as perfect in the role as he was over 15 years earlier. There is another exorcist this time 'round, but Nicol Williamson (perhaps best remembered as Merlin from 'Excalibur') is no Max Von Sydow. (I could swear there's a little Mercedes McCambridge voice cameo over the first little old lady, but have no way to confirm this...) And on top of all this are bizarre cameos from C. Everett Koop, Larry King, Samuel L. Jackson and FABIO, among others! All that said, this is not a perfect movie. There are some noticeable discrepancies between this and the first (though I must assume they're truer to the book, considering the source), the most obvious of which is the playing up of Kinderman's relationship with Karras. In the first movie, they met only once, I believe, before the latter died on those infamous stairs. In this film, however, it's repeatedly established that they were bosom companions. In addition to this are some problems with the crime mystery angle, mostly concerning police work, but nothing to spoil the movie. It's clear Blatty learned a great deal from Friedkin, as the latter's stylistic fingerprints are all over this. Granted, there are a couple directorial stumbles but for his second film (the first the very solid 'Ninth Configuration,' based on another of his novels) it's a decidedly decent effort. From the scene-establishing montage shots to the agonising attention paid to the sound engineering, this is a perfectly crafted sequel to the first film. Skip the second one (and the fourth, for that matter), and just make this THE 'Exorcist' sequel you love.",The Exorcist III
132,Sewaat,Exceeded my expectations,7,24 July 2015,"Nowadays, sequels are terribly frowned upon. They're infamous for being cheaply made only with the intent to grab money from people with the promise that it'll be just as good as the original. I had purposely skipped The Exorcist II because I had heard that it was laughably bad and not worth watching whatsoever. And initially, I wasn't even going to see this one. But I'm sure glad I did.George C. Scott plays the protagonist: a detective who's investigating a string of murders that are uncannily similar to the Gemini Killer case; a serial murderer who's victims are killed in grotesque and sinister ways. But there's only one problem: The Gemini killer was supposedly sentenced to death 15 years earlier, so he's left to figure out how he's able to kill again. Without giving anything away about the plot, I will tell you that the Gemini Killer is played by a phenomenal actor who I'm personally a fan of. Brad Dourif appears in only two scenes in this entire film, but damn do they stand out. He is absolutely enthralling. Dourif is able to invoke such rage, ferocity and insanity without coming off as completely over-the-top. He subtly creates a tragic yet terrifying complex of personality traits embodied into a mesmerizing performance. It was an absolute delight to watch him in the film.Thankfully there are other things to like about this film aside from Dourif's amazing performance. There are several well shot scenes that are just as disturbing as they are compelling. The last act in particular had me on the edge of my seat: it's the most tense I've ever been while watching a film in a long time. With that said, I wouldn't exactly classify it as a ""horror"" film so much as a suspense/crime drama. But it still has some fairly creepy moments.However, one thing that disappointed me was George C. Scott's acting in the lead role. Being such a seasoned and well experienced actor at this point in his career, you'd think that he could never give a bad performance. But unfortunately, he does in The Exorcist III. If you looked up ""chewing the scenery"" in the urban dictionary, I'm almost positive you would find his name there. Scott poorly delivered so many lines that I would actually find myself laughing during some scenes, but for all of the wrong reasons. Now to be fair, this may be the fault of William Peter Blatty who at best, was an amateur behind the camera. And clearly he was better at writing than he was at directing. He may have given Scott unclear or vague instructions which caused Scott to become confused and just wing it as best he could. Also, I should mention that not all of Scott's scenes are bad, but had a more experienced director been on set, things might have worked out differently. Scott's less than par acting in this film is the reason why I won't give it a higher rating than a 7.But overall, it's a great film that really exceeded my expectations, especially in the last two acts. It's as good as sequels come and I would recommend it to fans of the original film. One thing that people might find surprising is that it actually ties into the first Exorcist film rather well. I believe it's worth watching for Brad Dourif alone, but there's some additional scenes in the film that are also worth checking out. It's not everyone's cup of tea, but if you keep an open mind this film will definitely shock you.",The Exorcist III

134,severin72,Slightly muddled near-masterpiece,8,26 October 2006,"One of the few movies that genuinely scared me. Exorcist author Blatty assumes the director's chair to helm the film adaptation of his sequel Legion. The results are vicious, thought-provoking, and original. A serial killer is loose in Georgetown and the evidence leads Lt. Kinderman (George C. Scott, at his best) to a mental institution and all manner of, to use an over-worked phrase, unimaginable horrors. A lot of the novel's philosophical and theological mediations are inevitably lost but enough remain on screen to qualify this as one of the most thoughtful chillers out there. And at the same time it will rock the unwary out of their seats. The infamous ""corridor scene"" is a shot by shot masterwork of suspense that clocks in at an astonishing eight minutes plus. When was the last time a major film in the music video era dared do something like that? That's the most infamous shock but the death of Father Dyer, the ceiling walks, the early suggestions that something is very wrong with the patients, and the brilliant piece of understatement that is the scene introducing us to Father Morning (who would have thought gently billowing drapes on bright day could make you shudder?) all get an honorable mention. There's a pervasive sense of dread about this film that is hard to shake. It's masterfully directed, intelligently written and full of powerful performances. The climax, alas, is confused, confusing, doesn't fit the tone, and was largely the result of studio meddling. One is left wondering what a director's cut would have looked like.",The Exorcist III
135,pieterjanspiessens,Overall it's a boring mess,2,11 November 2018,"A lot of people say it's a brainy horror movie and it's not for everyone and i couldn't agree more. It's definitely not for me and i assume a lot of fans of the horror genre wont like this either. It's more a crime/detective movie than a horror movie, it has no gore in it and only a few scares but mostly filled with people talking. The best horror movies out there don't try to be smart because there is no need and no audience for it. To be honest I think most people expect a horror movie to be bloody or scary and not solely clever.

This movie is nnot only violent;  it's cerebral and, like it's progenitor, is spritiually based, which sets it apart from others in the genre.

The main fault I can see in this film is marketing.This should never have been given the title of Exorcist III.  The title alone raised expectations.This film simply can't be compared to the original.  This film is at its heart a mystery.  Ending with a similar battle for good vs. evil.George C. Scott's performance is as usual very well done.  If I can say there is anything wrong with the film it is with Blatty's direction and scripting.It's written for the stage, it seems.  Alot of what we see is filler.  Had this film been paced just a bit quicker with less of the talk with Brad Dourif's character, it would have been great.  Can you imagine Damien coming out to describe Hell?  Instead we have the Gemini Killer spouting off.I would have liked alot more screen time from other actors.  Which is WEIRD because I absolutely ADORE Brad Dourif.  Just not in this role.  It was time they could've spent better elsewhere.And of course Jason Miller was absolutely SQUANDERED on screen.  His only lines, although well delivered were just too brief.  And poorly written too. Would rather have seen them invest some money into re-doing this film (of course it would've required quite alot since George C. Scott passed away) than on messing up the original.

142,garyvanb,Competent Sequel to a Classic Horror Film,6,24 January 2021,"A worthy successor to one of the most terrifying horror movies ever made? Well, no. Still pretty good in its own right? Maybe. There were a few tense moments and shocking scenes, some suspenseful build up with at least one terrifying payoff with what is considered one of the best jumpscares in movie history. Some of the demon stuff was disgusting, some rather silly (the granny on the ceiling), but this is still loads better than that horrible part 2. I like George C. Scott as an actor, and Brad Dourif, and Jason Miller reprising his role from the first film, but all of Miller's and Dourif's scenes were confined to a single room in a nuthouse, and they had long stretches of exposition dialogue. If the original had a bunch of dialogue about a gemini killer, it wouldn't be the scary classic it became. I did, however, like one of Dourif's last lines in the movie, when he mumbled to Scott's character that it's ""Child's Play,"" having already done the voice of Chucky.
I saw this many years ago in the theater when it first came out, back in 1990, and the thing I remembered most about it was the audience in the theater. Many people chose to take their kids. When one priest was murdered and beheaded, the demon wrote in blood on the wall the title of the priest's favorite movie, It's a Wonderful Life. A child in the theater who wasn't old enough to read yet had to ask his parents what it said. I think that just about says it all, don't you?",The Exorcist III
143,tacomunky303,This is a stand alone sequel that is vastly underrated.,9,14 November 2012,"We have a murder on our hands, and Lieutenant Kinderman, played breathtakingly well by George C. Scott, is making jokes with his detectives. My personal favorite is, ""On the entry exam for the new policeman, they ask ""What are rabies and what would you do for them?"" Ryan said, ""Rabies are Jewish priests and I would do anything I possibly could for them."" ""He also has a pretty popular monologue about carp, but I won't spoil it. Anyway, a child from a group the police sponsors is beheaded. Meanwhile, Kinderman and Father Dyer go see ""It's a Wonderful Life"" as a way of forgetting their friend Damien Karras's death. They hang out at a restaurant where Kinderman fills Dyer in on the details of the slain boy. His head was replaced with a statue, stuff was jammed through his eyes, all that fun jazz.Later, a woman goes to confess to a priest and the priest ends up dead. Turns out, the same M.O. was used by the killer as was used on the boy. Soon after, Dyer ends up in a hospital, where all of his blood is drawn, without a single drop spilled, into jars. And with the remaining blood, the words ""It's a Wonderful Life"" are written on the wall. Well, it turns out that these killings are very similar, in fact, identical, to those of a previous serial killer named ""The Gemini Killer"". The only problem is, he's been dead for about fifteen years. So how is this happening?I know what you're thinking at this point in the review. What the holy hell does this have to do with ""The Exorcist""? Well, patience. It has a tie in. It turns out the spirit of the dead Gemini Killer found its way into Karras's body just before he died, and he's now locked in the basement of the hospital. How's he getting around? Why Father Karras's body? Well, that's up to you to find out. And trust me, it's worth it.One of the best things this movie has going for it is Brad Dourif, who plays the Gemini Killer. He even utters a line of shameless self-promotion. ""Child's play, Lieutenant."" The back and forth between Scott and Dourif is completely insane, and chalk full of over the top emotion. Tack on a creepy performance of Jason Miller, reprising his role as Father Karras as well as another character, and you've got a terrifically acted sequel.Is it scary? It has its moments. Particularly the scene in the hospital hallway, which has some of the best buildup and one of the best payoffs in horror history. In my personal opinion, and remember, this is purely opinion, this movie is better than the original.I know. Sacrilege, right? Well, we all have our tastes, and mine don't have to be yours. Give this movie a try. Maybe you won't feel the same way I do, but I know you'll enjoy it if you like horror. ___________________For all the Horror Banana reviews, visit http://morozov924.hubpages.com/",The Exorcist III
144,chrisf-uk,Underrated,9,19 March 2001,"Parts I and III of this series have just been shown on UK TV, confirming what I've long suspected : this is a *criminally* under-rated movie, streets ahead of the original in just about every way you can imagine. It's better written, better acted, and better directed. I honestly can't think of a scarier movie - the hallway scene gets me every time !What a shame it gets such a low score in the user ratings - the original deserves a 5, surely this is at least a 7 ?",The Exorcist III
145,tahirjon6,An Excellent Thriller.,8,26 June 2005,"This movie should NOT have been called The Exorcist III, it should have been called the Legion, or even the Exorcist II. It has nothing to do with that piece of crap second installment. This story follows the gruesome trail serial killings in the city Georgetown. The murders are shockingly similar to the killing spree of the Gemini killer years earlier.The twisting plot, shocking murders, incredible acting (minus Brad Dourif, who was AWFUL!) and chilling cinematography all contribute to make this one of the most underrated movies of all time.Brad Dourifs terrible acting nearly destroyed the credibility of his monologues.******** (8) out of ********** (10)",The Exorcist III
146,melody23,"A strong film which should have been called ""Legion"" for the name of the novel",10,25 January 2005,"I know why the film had to marketed with this title, but I wish it had been appended as a subtitle, second to the title of the novel on which it's based, ""Legion"". I'm afraid the other reviews for this film have assumed the stance of the mob in thinking this is some successor to ""Exorcist II"", which was inane.""Exorcist III"" is the REAL sequel to the Exorcist, however this script (III) is much smarter and more profound than the original. Due to the fact the writer and the director are the same man - William Peter Blatty, simultaneously among the world's most under-appreciated writers and directors - it makes the real point of the original novel. The real point of the novel ""The Exorcist"" was that Regan (and thus, Karras) was infested with the dark energy of the world. Its central assertion was that our despair and disbelief undermine our higher intentions.The Exorcist III carries out that theme in a manner common to many Blatty movies and novels...the ""great act of decency"" crawling from the darkness and reaching toward heaven. Blatty usually has a Christ figure (as with Kane in ""The Ninth Configuration"") and this film is no exception. Damian Karras finishes the job he began in the first film, in a last act of selflessness in one of the film's final and most effective scenes.As with most of Blatty's movies, this is a film that must be seen from the beginning...entering into the whole mental and emotional context.Sadly, all the main actors from this film are gone now - George C. Scott, Ed Flanders, and Jason Miller.",The Exorcist III

148,fenstonwinklepickers,The best Exorcist sequel,8,27 August 2009,"I have heard mixed reviews of this film. Some saying its the best Exorcist sequel and some saying its utter crap. Well to the people who say it's utter crap you have no idea what your talking about. This is by far the best Exorcist sequel, probably because it was actually written by William Peter Blatty (Writer of the first Exorcist). I think this should really be the Exorcist II because it begins where the first one finishes, and also because The Heretic was a joke.One of the reasons why I love this film is because it is essentially a mystery film (which I'm not usually to keen on) but it also has the major horror elements that make a horror film. The hallway scene at the hospital is one of the best horror scenes I have seen. Just the tension and the fact you don't know whats going on and the silence, then suddenly... well I wont give anything away. Its definitely different to the original so if your looking for another The Exorcist then look elsewhere, but this will probably still scare the daylights out of you.Overall, fantastic film and I'm glad that Father Karras is in this film because I loved his character in the original. 9/10",The Exorcist III
149,johnarmitage-97978,One of the most underrated horror movies ever!,10,1 October 2020,I was 16 when this film came out. I have genuinely loved it ever since. It has always suffered from mixed reviews unfortunately. William Peter Blatty directs brilliantly with amazing use of symbolism. It also has a multi layered story that blends from horror to thriller to mystery. An underrated gem that is beautifully acted and shot. The film should be hailed as a classic!,The Exorcist III
150,3rdMan,"Stylish, scary horror without gore.",10,9 October 1998,"An excellent example of how a movie can be genuinely frightening with barely a hint of gore. Good, if typically overwrought performances by George C. Scott, Brad Dourif and Nicol Williamson. A worthy successor to the Exorcist.",The Exorcist III
151,Milo Jerome,"Flawed though it is, I have a soft spot for this film for its intelligent, non-ironic journey into darkness.",8,23 January 1999,"William Peter Blatty can really write. Prose and dialogue. No argument. But can he direct a movie? On the strength of 'Exorcist III,' yes he can. This isn't to say that the film doesn't have its problems. On the contrary, its biggest problem, the out-of-character 'crowd-pleasing' SFX climax stops it from being one of the greats. So why do I have a soft spot for this film? If, like me, you appreciate horror films that are both scary and made for grown-ups, 'Exorcist III' is refreshing and memorable for its intelligent, non-ironic journey into darkness and for its refusal (bar that ending) to dumb down for the kids. If 'Scream' is your idea of a great horror movie, this isn't one for you! The cast is not nearly young and attractive enough, there are nowhere near enough gags (though Blatty's dry, sardonic wit is happily in evidence) and the film has no pretensions at being an autopsy of the genre, therefore somehow lifting it above the films it purports to comment on. 'Exorcist III' is literary beyond 'Scream's' self-referential trivia-chasing (I would love to hear Detective Kinderman critiquing that movie!) Read 'Legion' and you'll have an idea of how good the film should have been. Flaws acknowledged and accepted, don't miss out on Brad Dourif's best performance since 'Cuckoo's Nest,' scene-stealing turns by Ed Flanders and Nancy Fish, or the superlative production design, photography and sound. More than anything else, it's the atmosphere of the film that stays with me. I can recall very few films that have a better sense of the power of stillness and silence. So much of the violence is communicated only in dialogue; your mind reluctantly does the rest.",The Exorcist III
152,Andrew Devonshire,One Word; BRILLIANT!,9,4 June 2000,"From beginning to end I loved this film.  George C Scott's performance is so powerful and emotional that he makes all the events seem believable.  His magnificent screen presence makes every scene seem epic in its own right, and I could watch his speech on belief over and over.Ed Flanders is also brilliant as Father Dyer, replacing Rev. William O'Malley from the first film. With some of the funniest lines in the film, instead of the coldness that other films often give to religious characters, the viewer is drawn to identify with him and his believability.The supporting cast are universally excellent, each well realized and written. Each one is given their own unique stand out scene, making me wish more use had been made of them. Brad Dourif in particular is excellent in his role during the short times he is on the screen.William Peter Blatty also proves his capability as a director, an area he is not seen enough in, with wonderfully scary and suspense filled moments.Where this film succeeds is in not trying to out do, or even equal, the first film.  In this way it succeeds in making a very entertaining mix of horror, suspense and humour.Skip Exorcist 2 and go directly to this, 'The first true sequel' to the classic original, a brilliant peace of film making in its own right.",The Exorcist III
153,murnank,Give me cerebral over visceral anyday.,10,6 April 2009,"There is something very unsettling about ""The Exorcist III:Legion"". From the dreamlike opening sequence dabbed with disquieting images of Catholic Iconography, the menacing underscored acoustics and Director William Peter Blatty's unconventional cerebral style this is a sequel which compliments the original extremely well. Fifteen years after the original events a Psychopath is haunting Georgetown, slaying its victims using Satanic like rituals. The M.O is identical to the long dead ""Gemini Killer"" who was executed moments before Fr. Karras (Jason Miller) died from his injuries received during the 1973 Exorcism of Regan MacNeil. When Lt. Kinderman a character from ""The Exorcist"" (Played here to perfection by the late George C. Scott) is called in to investigate the killings his discoveries lead him to a room in a dark Asylum where a man who looks like Fr. Karras (Miller) but sounds like ""The Gemini Killer"" (Brad Dourif) admits in detail to all the ritualistic killings and also claims to be possessed by the legion of demons who once possessed the MacNeil child. But if this is the man responsible for the Georgetown murders how is he leaving the maximum security Asylum. When I saw this movie in 1990 I was only fifteen. I didn't appreciate back then its powerful use of intellect and dialogue over the other visceral movies I had been accustomed to like ""A Nightmare on Elm Street"" and even the original ""The Exorcist"". What Blatty gives to us here is a Film that respects the structure and elements of the 1973 classic and is wise enough to not copy its inimitable terrifying sequences. This movie has its own unique and disturbing images. Moving religious statues, standout murder set-pieces, brilliant demonic performances from Jason Miller and Brad Dourif and a powerfully executed Exorcism finale that although not as powerful as its originator still stands up well to anything that we've been offered cinematically since.",The Exorcist III
154,svarta_skuggan,Underrated masterpiece,9,9 July 2012,"First and foremost I must say that I have watched this film more often than the original one with Max von Sydow. Why? I have asked myself that many a times. Why watch a sequel more often than the original one? I cannot explain it to myself. I absolutely adore the first Exorcist film, but there was something about The Exorcist III that kept me coming back to it over and over again.For the first, the story is very solid. This is a direct sequel to the first Exorcist film as W. P. Blatty intended with his novel Legion (1983). Blatty is also the director of this adaptation for the screen which became The Exorcist III. I will not discuss here The Exorcist II: The Heretic since due to the story's continuity it might as well have not been made. What we have here is a work of love, love from the writer towards his characters that he has fleshed in his previous book, as well as an innermost desire to make sense of all the questions that were left unanswered in the first The Exorcist.We have the always brilliant George C. Scott in the role of lieutenant Kinderman that is torn between new murders that resemble the profile of an old serial killer. On the other side of the spectrum we have Brad Dourif as the Gemini Killer, that does the ""role of a lifetime"" if I may so romantically put it. I have seen many films with Dourif and he never quite trumps his performance in this film (with the possible exception of his role in Deadwood, which closest comes on par).So why have I, in the end seen this one more times than the first Exorcist? I have to say that it is due to W. P. Blatty's strong story as well as surprisingly coherent and well done direction, but also due to the main characters of George C. Scott and Brad Dourif and their interaction with each other. But also for Ed Flanders' role as Father Dyer who seemed to have an entertaining and charming love/hate relationship with George C. Scott's character.The make up and horror scenes are there as well, but for me I will always regard this as one of the best sequells made for a film/book that was already perfect.",The Exorcist III

156,skotgp,OK . . . so three of the stars go to George C. Scott.,4,18 February 2003,"Sooo . . . first let me be honest that I thought I was buying a DVD of 'The Exorcist'; you know that movie with Linda Blair.  Somehow I missed the Roman Numeral 'III' stuck in the middle of the 'O' in Exorcist on the cover.  Took me about twenty minutes to realize something was drastically wrong with this movie, or at least my expectations of it.  You see, I'd never seen the first Exorcist, still haven't, but I knew there was supposed to be this rather gifted child star.  Nope, not in this one.  And some really outstanding special effects, especially for 1973.  Nope, there are some reasonably passable gore scenes, but nothing like a spinning head, and, considering it was 1990 when this one was released . . . what a disappointment.Now, I have always had a lot of respect for Mr. Scott. . in fact his 1971 black comedy ""The Hospital"" still ranks as one of my favorite movies.  But what drives a gifted, principled actor to sign on to a project like this?  I really hope he thought it would turn out far better than it did.",The Exorcist III
157,Mariav-4,Best Horror Movie Ever,10,31 December 2006,"This movie is one of my all time favorites. It is somewhat intellectual I guess but I remember seeing it at the movies with my friends and having that creepy scared feeling you usually want from a horror movie when leaving. I have not felt that with any other movie. This is not ""Scream"" or ""I know what you did last summer"" - it is a really suspense filled horror flick that is much much better than the original. I agree with other reviewers when they say this movie is not watched enough and suffered low ratings due to the title. The Exorcist II was just ridiculous and I did not find the original to be scary in the least and certainly did not find it engaging like this film. Give it a try - You will like it. There are parts that will terrify you and the whole movie will give you an uneasy creepy feeling that will make you remember this film for years to come.",The Exorcist III

I kid you not I was virtually unable to walk up the stairs had to turn the light on and call the dog to me! This film contains a few stand out shock moments and the scene in the hospital ward is without doubt the single most startling moment I have ever seen.Admittedly when I resumed watching the following day(afternoon) it tailed off a bit the ending not living up to the rest of it almost like they decided to rush it which is why it only makes it to number 2 of my top ten list. How this movie isn't higher rated by everyone is beyond me this should be up there as the one to beat,if the marketing had been done in the right way this would have been a £100 million movie,I mean if a good run of the mill film like the conjuring can do it?",The Exorcist III

160,MichaelLibinAP,Surprisingly good thriller,8,13 January 2008,"The first 6/8 of ""Exorcist III"" are very good indeed. Please, for God's sake, skip ""Exorcist II"", the catastrophe that nearly killed the good name of ""The Exorcist"". ""III"" has some of the most genuinely creepy moments captured on film--some even surpass the original (particularly the ""things that go bump in the night"" sequence in the hospital). Noteworthy are the many moments (sometimes almost out of our view) of dissonant images or behaviors that make watching ""Exorcist III"" a most uncomfortable experience. And I mean that in the best possible way.Unfortunately, something odd happens in the final moments of this film--all hell breaks loose. Literally. And then ""Exorsist III"" moves from psychological horror into ""Devil made me do it"" bedlam. Pity, because this film is really quite good. Brad Dourif does a fine job, and how nice to see Jason Miller again. And Nancy Fish as Nurse Allerton nearly steals the film. Though George C. Scott chews the scenery as the film progresses, Blatty appears to have done a fine job of reigning in the ""ham factor"" early on, and it's a better film for his efforts.By all means, check this overlooked gem out. But you might need to leave the lights on while you do. And don't watch it if there's a hospital stay in your immediate future!",The Exorcist III
161,poofta1970,Intelligent and cerebral. An ideal continuation of the original.,10,26 September 2004,"First of all I recommend to readers that they try the original book 'Legion' by William Peter Blatty which gives a clearer picture of what the film should have been like before the studio executives got their hands on it. And also that you see 'The Ninth Configuration' also directed by Mr Blatty which confirms both his style and competence. (it's a very moving, funny and creepy film just as this would have been) George C Scott is perfect as Kinderman, his humanity laid bare by his repulsion at what is humanly possible and his love for family and friends. like Karras in the original film (and book) he challenges the existence of a God that allows death, pain, loss and suffering. The sad thing about the cut of the film available is that it creates the impression that Kinderman in the end is convinced that the devil exists but the divine is largely absent. Only a repeat of the sacrifice of Father Karras from the first story shows any victory for good. Brad Dourif is also totally convincing as the spirit of the serial killer inhabiting Karras. I would have liked to have seen more about the Gemini in the film (once again read the book for this) Nicol Williamson's Father Morning, isn't in the book nor is the flashy ending. It smells badly of studio interference again and I hope Blatty gets a chance to do a directors cut to rectify these scenes. This film is creepy enough without the need for the gore and push button shocks that most modern films fall back on way too much. It's also (and this might seem odd for a film of this type) a very funny film. Blatty started out writing comedy and it shows. Give this film a chance, it has one scene that will make you jump out of your skin (I guarantee this!) And a lot to say about the human condition.",The Exorcist III

The film gradually evolves, and has been criticised for having a slow start, but there's quite a lot of details packed in.This is a film which may be hard to follow, and may even seem dull on the first viewing, but things gradually fall into place after repeated viewings (reading the book also helps).  My opinion is that this is a superb thriller, with several chilling scenes (including one or two that will literally make you jump out of your skin).",The Exorcist III

Did Blatty help our unbelief, or was he proficiently mocking religion? Or maybe both? ""It is not enough to be a spirit. There's no magic"". It's the body, the touch. Even serial killers need it. (Btw, this movie was Jeffrey Dahmer's favorite. Plus, he was also a Gemini.) ""The whole world is a homicide victim. That's the thriLL of it. No motive.

Everything in this film is so subtle that you could miss the best parts the first time you view it. EVERY line is important and almost every shot is revealing something on another level(look for celeb cameos during dream sequences and in the diner).   Huge meaning of life and theological issues are touched upon and are ultimately important to the resolution. Watch this film in wide screen, alone and with the lights low. And then watch it again you will be amazed how much you missed and how well planned this film was. I love Patton, but this is a much more intense role and possibly Scott's best.

Magnificent performances and a truly mesmerizing continuation of the original story make this one of my top films.  George C. Scott did an excellent job taking over Lee J. Cobb's Lt. Kinderman.  His portrayal fits the book precisely, and his character is never doubted for a moment.  Ed Flanders was a riot, and his friendship with Kinderman seemed more sincere than most performances by `A' movie actors like Val Kilmer and Jim Carrey could only dream about.  The other standout performance is the ever reliable Brad Dourif, a true actor.  He is once again perfectly cast, and delivers his best of his typecast possessed characters.  The film itself manages to both stand alone, and pick up where the first left off, ignoring John Boorman's inept Exorcist II: The Heretic, a monument to putridity. Ultimately this is one of the rare cases where the film is actually more enjoyable than the book, as the changes to the end were definitely for the better.  10 out of 10.",The Exorcist III
170,Moby-13,A Superb but Overlooked Psychological Horror,10,22 November 2000,"I tend to feel compelled to add reviews for movies I feel strongly about, where I disagree with the majority of sentiments previously given.This film is a finely crafted psychological horror film, the result of some impressive direction by William Peter Blatty, and strong performances by George C Scott and Brad Dourif.I hear a lot of people praising The Exorcist, but I always found the original incarnation of that film lacking in story continuity. I had read the novel many years prior to seeing it, and must say I was disappointed with the film (although not the book). In fact, I actually fell asleep twice watching The Exorcist, and had to watch it several times to see the film in it's entirety. I found the flow of the story was pretty horrid, so I was continually wondering if I had missed a particular scene which future scenes seemed to be referencing. I hadn't - they had been removed. Later on, reading comments and seeing interviews with Blatty, he basically said the same thing. They were a point of contention between Blatty (the screenwriter for Exorcist) and William Freidkin (the director) over a period of more than 20 years. The updated release has apparently corrected some of these story problems (where footage was still available), but I have yet to see it. Apparently Blatty's incessant nagging had some effect.In fact, the aspect of The Exorcist I appreciated the most were the background they provide for Exorcist III. In particular, the original ending (which was cut from the original release), showing the beginning of the friendship between Detective Kinderman and Father Dyer; and the background on other characters featured in III.Exorcist III continues from where The Exorcist ended, although many years later. The friendship between Kinderman and Dyer has survived the years, and begins with the arrival of a force of evil in the town, in the form of a series of brutal religious motivated killings. Kinderman links these murders to people from the original Exorcist, and discovers that both an old friend and an old enemy he thought dead may still be alive. Although (not to give too much away here) in the same body.Brad Dourif gives an outstanding performance as the Gemini Killer. I honestly feel myself cowering under his verbal onslaught in certain scenes of this film. Dourif is an actor I would dearly love to see more of in films. And Blatty is someone I'd dearly love to see directing more horror films.The violence in this film is primarily off camera, but there are some excruciatingly suspenseful and impressively choreographed scenes leading up to deaths. In particular, there is a scene leading to the death of a Nurse. It is shown from a fixed camera perspective, where the actual death is off camera. The tension is built up to so well it is actually more shocking than if you saw it on camera, where your overstressed imagination fills in the blanks. The horror seems very real and personal in this film. The only real gore of the film comes in at the ending. I had read elsewhere that this ending was not the ending the director originally had, but was added at the `request' of the studio to make the film more horrific. I would be interested in seeing a special edition DVD of this title, but given it is an entirely overlooked film, there is little chance (but I guess if an insignificant film such as `Romper Stomper' can get a 2 disc special edition, I guess anything can happen).",The Exorcist III

The scene in the hospital where the killer, in a white sheet, goes after the nurse with a pair of shears has got to be one of my favorite unnerving scenes ever. It takes so long to happen BUT when it does, WOW!!!!!!!!!!!",The Exorcist III
172,SorcererLink22,Just Wow!,2,9 March 2008,"I picked this movie up just because I had purchased the first two and boy did I want to demand my money back. I guess it was good for them stretching it, but as an all in all movie it's really sucks. George C Scott delivered a brilliant performance like always, but the all around story sucked, pretty much forgetting the first two movies and just taking the surviving characters and throwing them in a whirlwind of religious crap and cheeky slasher ideas. The book Legion was far better and just wish William Peter Blatty could've done a better job with the third installment. Two thumbs way down. I think there was one mention of the previous movies and in where does any of it fall the battle between Legion and Father Morning. It was all completely missed and they just added it for time filler. I think the only redeemable part of this movie was the return of Jason Miller as Damien Karris, however how was it missed that his body was never laid to rest, or the fact that he remained under the care of a hospital wing for oh so long?? And what of the fact that the demon has a personal grudge with the surviving cast members of The Exorcist. Instead of going after the little girl and her mother who managed to stop it in it's tracks, it just decides to weed through everyone else in Georgetown. It just left too many questions for it being a third installment. The first is brilliant and I know it's suicide for a sequel to compare it to the original, but damn you can only go so far before it's impossible to compare a little. The darkness and morbid settings of the first one were brilliantly constructed, whereas this one they just filled a cheap rip off of ""The Zodiac Murders,"" and slapped Exorcist III in the title. Avoid this unless you really want to waste an hour and a half of your life.",The Exorcist III

175,Croc O'Dile,Underrated thriller is high on creepy atmosphere.,9,15 October 1999,"The third installment of the Exorcist series is a surprisingly ominous and subtle thriller, unlike it's widely (and rightfully) panned predecessor, Exorcist II: The Heretic.Based upon William Blatty's novel ""Legion"", George C. Scott stars as a policeman investigating a series of shocking and inexplicable murders.  His growing obsession with finding the killer leads him deeper into the supernatural and threatens everyone around him.Featuring fantastic performances by Brad Dourif and the late George C. Scott as well as a great supporting cast, Exorcist III is good enough to stand on it's own; unfortunately the attached ""horror sequel"" stigmata in this case likely did not help attract any new fans to the picture.  The references to the first Exorcist are few, but still important.If you're looking for non-stop action, look elsewhere, because only towards the end do you get much.  What you will get however is amazingly potent and eerie visuals full of weird oddities that you could miss if you blink. It's mostly a very quiet, solemn movie, but it did not fail to hold my interest for a moment and the few shocks are quite genuine.  There are moments that even David Lynch would be proud of.If you like a thinking man's horror film, do yourself a favor and check out Exorcist III.  Just keep a light on.",The Exorcist III
176,Luke S,The True Exorcist Sequel,6,28 May 2001,"I had a good time with The Exorcist III. The film focuses around a serial killer who died the same night of the exorcism of 73 and found a home in Karras,to exact revenge on those involved with the exorcism.  Blatty gives us a good screenplay and some very scary scenes (the hallway murder,the confession, the head chopper). The acting was right on (Miller, Dourif, Scott). Alot of people put down the film becuase they felt it wasnt understandable. However if you pay close attention to the original and the scenes with the gemini killer and Scott you wont have much of a problem. I liked seeing Jason Niller return as Damien, great cast revival by Blatty. Whereas 2 continues Blares story, 3 continues Damiens and Kindermans. The films greatest strength is that it does its best to be a true sequel to the original, and succeeds. What i felt was bad for the film was a first hour that seemed to lag and an ending that seemed very rushed and forced. Just a little more effort into this one and it probably would have made more at the box office. Overall, a watchable sequel and one that does the exorcist name proud.",The Exorcist III
177,antonioEKU,The only REAL sequel to the Exorcist,10,16 January 2002,With a poor attempt by someone to make an Exorcist sequel...a failed attempt in part 2 by the way...William Peter Blatty stepped back in to make the real sequel to the original Exorcist. After seeing part 1 and hearing that this movie was done by the original creator I knew that it had to be good. Guess what? It was better than good. This movie is directly tied to the first one but it doesn't feel anything like a repeat. It's totally different yet the storylines are all connected. You'll see if you see them both. Brad Douriff does an excellent job in the movie. You may remember Brad as the voice of Chucky from the Childs Play movies and a brief human form appearance in the original Childs Play. He is very creepy in this movie and pops up out of nowhere. You will recognize the voice if nothing else. Don't feel completely fullfilled by the original Exorcist? Want more? Jump over The Exorcist II and check out part III. You shouldn't be disappointed.,The Exorcist III
178,frootjoose,I was expecting a movie I could fall to sleep to... So much the opposite,10,27 October 2008,"I am one of the many Americans who has gained weight over the years. I'm not fat, just a bit chubby. In an effort to correct this, I have been walking more. Every morning, rain or shine, before sunrise, I take a mile-long walk. The only time I miss it is when I'm sick. I've been doing this consistently for about a year.The morning after I watched this movie, I did not go on my walk. Instead, I was curled up on the couch, watching crappy family sitcoms, just trying to get the chill off my spine.When I first purchased this movie, I, like so many others, thought I was buying the original The Exorcist. I had never seen it before, so I did not know what the cover should look like, and I missed the little 'III' in the 'O.' So when I got home, I discovered my blunder. I had never even heard of this movie. I had never even heard of the Exorcist II! Naturally, I was expecting it to suck. You know... 'If I've never even heard of it, it can't be very big, and if it was good, it'd be big.' And then I watched it. There was not a single moment where I was not enveloped in suspense. The nurse's station scene is a MASTERPIECE. Period. Not only did it scare me more than any other scene in any other movie I have ever watched, but it was just so finely crafted. The camera never moves. It's like it's just edging you on, warning you that something huge is going to happen. And, if you're anything like me, your eyes start playing tricks on you. Because it was so still, I kept looking for things that were moving, and I kept thinking the door was opening slightly, or that something was twitching. Every time she left the screen, I held my breath, and every time she returned, I sighed in relief. Then, when she returned for her last time... well, I swear I would have screamed if I wasn't petrified into stillness.And the astonishing thing is, they manage to pull all of this off with very little gore! This is not a slasher horror. It is a psychological thriller. If you watch it and are not terrified, in my estimation, you are simply not attentive enough to get it.I have not seen the original so I cannot compare the two, but I can say that this movie scared me more than any other movie I have ever watched.

179,mreddiemcgrath,The Exorcist 3; the most underrated horror movie of all time!,10,26 August 2018,"The Exorcist 3; the most underrated horror movie of all time!
In 1990, the director William Peter Blatty released the Exorcist 3. The plot centres around Detective Kinderman (played by George C. Scott) and his friend Father Dyer ( Ed Flanders). The two meet up every year on the anniversary of the death of their friend Father Damien Karras and cheer themselves up by going to see a film called "" It's a Wonderful Life "" but this year is different, as there is a serial killer on the loose. The killer tortures his victims the very same way as a killer called the Gemini killer did, the only problem, he is supposed to be dead 15 years.
The problem that the movie faced was in fact the fault of the two Exorcist movies that came before it, '1' and 2'. While Exorcist 3 was a master class in the thriller/ horror genre, people were expecting to see an 'in your face' horror movie with the same shocking visual effects they had seen in the first two. This film is a slow burner with not a drop of blood spilled, but don't let that fool anyone into a false sense of security, as the greatest trick this movie plays is on the mind, because it's not what you see but what you can't see which is the most frightening thing about this film. This film is a must see for any true horror film fan as the sense of evil lurking behind every scene is almost touchable as the plot unfolds, with one particular scene that is guaranteed to make the most hardened horror fan jump out of their seat.",The Exorcist III

The scene in the hospital hallway where the shrouded killer stalks the nurse and the scene where the old lady, possessed by the killer demon, spider-crawls on the ceiling are bone-chilling.  But here's the real skinny--the movie is almost impossible to follow unless you've read the book.  I saw it once before I read it and was hopelessly lost.  But after I'd finished the book, the movie made complete sense.  With or without the book, it's dozens of times better than ""Exorcist II"" and should be regarded as the true sequel to ""The Exorcist.""",The Exorcist III

This movie is an Exorcist sequel, however, you do not need to see The Exorcist to understand what is happening.  It is an awesome movie on its own, and when stood by The Exorcist, another great film, it breaks the Law of Sequel Performance.  I feel that this is one of the few sequels that outshines the original. William Peter Blatty also does an awesome job in setting the mood.  The shots are beautiful, almost enough to move me to tears.  The dialogues in the movie are fantastic, there are so many awesome quotes that I am at a lack of words to describe this movie, thus I will make up a word...Trampulescent.

The nature of each original is so different from its sequel.And let's forget Exorcist II, a lowbudget misfortune, unrelated to its parent feature and pumped out to capitalize on a Hollywood success.Exorcist III is the adaptation of Legion, Blatty's sequel novel to the Exorcist.It is directed with an unsettling eye, sometimes tricking us into believing solid matter is passable, spirits are transient, and murder is a creative art form. Most impressive is that none of this is achieved via visual effects.Writer/director Willam Blatty uses dialogue, camera angles, sounds, sound editing and other cinematic legerdemain to fool us. All this is in aid to the performances of The Two Towers' Brad Dourif, The Exorcist's Jason Miller and Patton's George C. Scott, all of whom delivered brilliant dialogue with frightening intensity.Perhaps the greatest tragedy here is the Academy overlooking this film for best sound editing, particularly in regards to the eerie oscillations worked throughout the vocal tracks. I have never seen it executed this well, before or since.The film may seem slow to some viewers, but its even pace just allows us to smell the dead roses along the way.",The Exorcist III

I can't think of another movie which has an author adapting his own novel into a screenplay AND directing a movie. The exorcist III is by far the best horror/thriller of all time and I don't see it being topped at anytime. It is so much better than the first, the sole reason why they decided to add footage to the original containing elements from the third installment. IF the original exorcist WERE better than the exorcist III, why would they edit the original using the very same elements used in the Third? I can't explain that, but some believe it. I believe many have not seen the Exorcist III, and even after watching it they simply do not understand it to be frightened by it. The exorcist III combines true character development with crime drama, horror, and suspense, utterly perfect movie making. Jtown",The Exorcist III
185,Tangstad,Good example on how sequels should be done!,9,25 March 2005,"The Exorcist III is probably the best in the Exorcist series. Very underrated. It contains lots of superb dialog, and very good acting. George C. Scott is very good in the role as the lieutenant, and Brad Dourif is probably the best actor in the entire series of The Exorcist. The way he shows him self and how he plays different roles, the Devil, The Gemini Killer and the little girl. Don't expect lots of special effects, because you'll be disappointed. The Exorcist 3 is not a splatter-feast, it's more of a serial killer film. The hunt for the brutal killer goes on, and in the ending we get to know him. Some scenes is real intense, because of the good mix of a great soundtrack and good cinematography.

186,wgh-2,Deserves its IMDb rating!,6,4 November 2005,"Watched it last night for the first time. Found it pretty average ... George C. Scott is great though ... and there were a few very creepy moments. Unfortunately though, the film as a who-dunnit-it sucked. It was quite obvious early on as to the means used in performing the murders.The film was also guilty of treating its audience like idiots e.g. (Minor spoiler alert here) When it was revealed that the fingerprints from the confessional were different to those found in the first murder, George blurts out something like ""so we have two different killers"". Totally redundant dialogue. There are a few other examples of this in the film where I just had to groan.And as for the exorcism scene, its a joke.In conclusion, this film is nothing in comparison to the original exorcist movie. The original is much richer thematically, more horrifying and more atmospheric. The exorcist III is merely a mediocre horror/Detective hybrid video flick.If you want to see a really good horror film with George C. Scott in it, go check out ""The Changeling"".",The Exorcist III

So one night I rented this movie and was blown away. It's written and directed by William Peter Blatty, who wrote the original book and this book. He does an amazing thing with taking the lore of the original and having a murder mystery about the ""Gemini"" killer and joining them with a perfect balance. Acting is top notch and there are some very very creepy moments.

190,matthewcadarette,A Respectable Follow-Up,7,10 April 2003,"I waited a long time to finally get around to renting this. From what I heard previously, this was a terrible film, but after reading the reviews here, it seemed to have a certain following. So I bit the bullet and parted with my $3.65 (yeah, I'm a tightwad). I'm a huge fan of the original, and think it's the scariest movie ever -- I cannot fathom how some people think it's boring or funny.I enjoyed Exorcist III because (after reading reviews) I had the right expectations. I was ready for a suspenseful drama (a la ""The Omen""), rather than lots of visual effects and shock value. It's long and a bit slow, but builds well and reaches a great climax, kinda like a World Series game.My one disappointment was that when it originally came out, I was in high school and my friend saw it. He described a scene where a woman crawls around on the ceiling like it was the scariest thing ever. I couldn't wait for that scene. When it finally happened, I actually thought it was a bit funny. This is a far cry from the 'spider-walk' scene in the original...One last comment: it's amazing how much more impact that old-fashioned 'analog' effects have compared to new digital ones. For instance, the voice of the demon in the original was done by Mercedes McCambridge (I think that's right), and was UNALTERED. That blew me away when I read that. And it's chilling. In Exorcist III, you know that the 'scary voices' are just done with pitch shifters, and it just doesn't effect you as much. This is similar to the original Star Wars effects, which were miniature models and matte paintings -- they are much more powerful than the new digital imagery.All in all, I gave it a 7. A good flick, not earth-shattering, and nowhere near the original. Ultimately entertaining, though.",The Exorcist III

Maybe not quite a top ten or even top twenty horror film of all time although it is one of mine, it is easily one of the most underrated and under-appreciated horror films ever! Part of the interest is the plethora of cameos, including ex-Surgeon General C. Everett Koop, Larry King, John Thompson and Patrick Ewing. But the real attraction comes in its many scary sequences. As if the dream sequence isn't enough, it gets better with the classic hospital scene where the camera sits still for what seems like hours of anticipation before you are made to jump out of your seat.

193,sbrooks839,What A Convoluted Mess!,5,19 February 2017,"I don't know if it's because I hadn't seen this film in a few years, or that it took the Director's Cut to make me see that it is a very bad movie. Bad ""TV"" acting, bad dialogue, and a very convoluted story line. And I'm finding myself seeing for the first time that a really good story was missed that should have been told: Kinderman's daughter gets possessed by the demon. Nice and simple. No Gemini Killer crap, no ""Damian is back from the dead"" crap. And, also, upon seeing the Director's Cut, I find it infuriating that so many others that have seen it miss that Blatty had originally cast Brad Dourif to play Damien Karris, not just the Gemini Killer. Thank god that Morgan Creek forced him to re-write and re-film large chunks of the movie and bring in Jason Miller. But, sadly, I see that even that the theatrical version is a bad movie that hasn't aged well.I am very familiar with the book ""Legion"", and also very familiar with everything about the film. I bought and read the book when it came out in 1983, and first saw the movie when it hit theaters back in 1990, and have watched it several times over the years. Matter of fact, there was a time in the mid 80's when I was interested in trying to adapt the book into a screenplay, but never really did anything with it other than doing some cover art and a small two or three page treatment. And as I said, watching the film again (especially after watching the Director's Cut), I now realize what a bad, dated, convoluted film it is. The acting is pedestrian, TV movie material, ugh. George C. Scott is way too over the top in so many scenes. The dream sequence is atrocious, and looks like something made-for-TV quality. Plus, I've always thought that the dream sequence was in the wrong spot, and would have been better suited if it had been at the end of the film after Kinderman shot Karris and the scene cuts to the sun, then it could have cut to the dream sequence, then end. But, it still wouldn't have saved what is in my opinion a very convoluted mess of a screenplay. The whole ""let's bring Damien Karris back from the dead, and he is possessed by the Gemini Killer who happened to have been put to death as Damien flung himself out the window at the end of 'The Exorcist' and has inhabited his body for 15 years"" is beyond ridiculous. H*ll, it almost makes Boorman's sequel a classic in comparison, lol. And, yes, having Kinderman's daughter being possessed would kind of be a retread of ""The Exorcist"", but all these years later, I just think that would have made for the better story for Blatty to have pursued. And, no, I didn't find it to be confusing, I am just now realizing how convoluted it all is. And, I probably sounded too harsh about the film initially, because honestly I do still like it a lot, and am glad it was made (even though I've always wished the title would have been ""Exorcist III: Legion""). Some of the comments I made about the pedestrian acting (especially in the dream sequence) has always been a complaint of mine, and am noticing it even more on recent viewings. But, I guess not everyone can get such top drawer realistic portrayals from their cast like Freidkin can. I'm also really just now noticing for the first time how the music and demonic sounds are also so over-the-top and really unnecessary. And don't get me started on some of the cheap jump scares that lead to nothing (I saw in other reviews people talking about this, and people would try to defend it by saying that ""The Exorcist"" also had those, but no that movie did not - yes, it had some ""false scares"", but they were not cheaply done at all). And, again, thank god that Morgan Creek stepped in and made Blatty re-shoot some scenes, including the ending, because his original ending sucked loud!And the whole casting Brad Dourif as Damien Karris was a horrendous decision that was rightfully rectified, as I already mentioned. After all these years, I can only rate this as a mediocre five-star (out of ten) sequel to ""The Exorcist"", one of the greatest horror films of all time, but I still highly recommend purchasing the Special Edition Scream Factory blu-ray, because it is filled with special features that make it well worth the purchase!Again, it is definitely worth the investment to get the Scream Factory blu-ray!

194,jmika-1,Flat out scary.,10,15 August 2004,"I know everyone says that the original Exorcist was supposedly scary. I don't know if it's the numbing exposure of today's television programs or movies, but I barely found it troubling. However, if you are looking for a great late-night movie to make you look over you shoulder and check the lock before bed, the Exorcist III is the way to go.Besides the brilliant work of William Peter Blatty in Legion, the screen writers and casting directors have created an all star ensemble. George C. Scott is stoically brilliant in his performance. Especially the movie scene when he discusses 'the fish'.If you truly like scary movies, then this should be your choice. This Halloween sit down at midnight and begin the Exorcist III completely engaged in your viewing. Don't drink, don't smoke, don't inhibit your senses in any way, otherwise you'll find it as mediocre as the other voters on this site.*SPOILER*By far my favorite scene in the movie is the hospital. It begins with a chop of the Jesus or Mary statue decapitated and leads to a hauntingly silent decapitation of a nurse. Great stuff.The only problems I have with the movie is the 'fantastic' ending. While we all know there should be a confrontation, it is difficult to take the fairly believable first three-quarters of the story and substitute it with a supernatural ending.

Even Ms. Lindfors warned my girlfriend NOT to see this movie.Fans of the original Exorcist - like me - will find themselves scratching their heads. The character of Lt. Kinderman should've been left out altogether. His age would've placed him beyond retirement since Exorcist III takes place 15 years after the events of the original movie.George C. Scott overpowers the role of Kinderman. Just compare the personalities of Lee J. Cobb's role with Scott's and you'll see a dramatic transformation. Cobb was quiet, congenial. Scott was at times raging mad.The pacing of the movie is sluggish. The carp dialogue was for injecting a little humor and it takes an eternity to reach the punchline. The murder of nurse Amy finds her forever wandering the hallways of the hospital before she finally meets her end. Brad Dourif's long monologues in the mental ward are both silly and sleep-inducing. The Director's Cut is far worse, especially with Dourif impersonating a locomotive!The ties to the original film make it worth a try. The setting, characters - namely Father Karras - , and the exorcism finale will please fans of the original film.But, the potential this movie had! More characters from the original film could've been brought back since they were still alive. Max Von Sydow probably would've been a better choice for Patient X. He only suffered a heart attack at the end of The Exorcist whereas Father Karras suffered a devastating fall from a window and a horrific tumble down a steep staircase. The original Father Dyer should've returned since his role was short anyway. The psychiatrist from the original film could've been in charge of the mental ward setting up potential interesting scenes between him and the possessed priest.The plot needed fixing. Was it a murder mystery or another Exorcist tale? Fans needed a decent sequel to the original Exorcist since The Heretic was such a disaster. Exorcist III had the potential to be that film. But, Blatty took on too much work handling the duties of both screenwriter and director. Putting ego aside, he should have brought in William Friefdkin to direct this one, too.",The Exorcist III

(Ignore Exorcist II as an irrelevance, furthermore avoid seeing it) The book in question was entitled: 'Legion', in reference to Christ's biblical conversation with a person reputedly possessed of a demon. When Christ faced the possessed person and asked their name, the response was 'My name is legion, for we are many'. Christ then allegedly cast the demon's evil spirit out into some pigs, who then promptly threw themselves down some steps in the Georgetown area of D.C....ooops, I meant over a cliff. Over a cliff...thats right.Whilst this film is a wonderous piece of cinema, as I mention in my summary... The book is even better. This is owing to the grand expanse of it's scope and elemental content.I'll just mention one element that is described more thoroughly in the book 'Legion' and this is namely the background story to Doctor Amfortas, the 'Travelling man's' unwilling assistant in this diabolic jamboree.Having waxed lyrical about the book, this film is still an outstanding achievement, best watched in a dark smokey atmosphere with great surround sound. George C Scott outdoes his previous outing into the paranormal (The Changelling) with wry aplomb.My only piffling gripes would concern dodgy contact lenses and Father Morning's wood....I mean wooden counternance. But as I love this fil so much I simply won't add any more. Oh and there is slight concern that in the originalfilm 'Exorcist', Kinderman did'nt seem to be so very close to the priest Damien.This film is for the ages.......I must go, mother India is calling.",The Exorcist III
197,allanwaters-86617,Magnificently malignant and macabre,9,19 July 2018,"The preamble to this review, has to be, that this movie, is my favourite psychological horror of the last 30 years. If you are going into to watch this movie with expectations of gore dripping grotesquely from the screen, then don't expect a lurid bloodbath. This celluloid masterpiece, hits you deep with the cerebral grey matter. The acoustic's are scything and scathing, the acting is visceral and precise, the atmosphere and tension is palpably tangible. I could go and on and on into infinitum with superaltives... ... But I don't want to spoil this orgy of the senses for potential first timers taking in this psychologically, horrifying spectacle. The director clearly had a vision to deliver onto the screen, and this was executed with gusto and aplomb. The scenes are set with immaculate precision, guiding us gently through each frame, shepparding us until the director sends us spiralling headlong out of control, bathing our brains in tension and revulsion. The screenplay is simply superb. Along with the acoustics and direction, the narrative fiercely fuels our inner fears. Some of the psychiatric ward scenes are delivered in odious and undulating spades of nightmarish debauchery. I wanted to give a magisterial mention to the nurse station scene. All of the above, is constellated into a cocktail of suspenseful, petrifying horror. If you aren't flung out of your skin into the stratosphere by the climax of this scene, give yourself a hearty pat on the back! The only exiguous quibbles with this movie and the reason it hasn't scored a resounding 10/10, is the films duration(a tad short) , and a certain actor being struck from the proceedings all to abruptly. In surmation, watch this malevolent scare fest of gut wrenching terror . It's woven together into a beguiling, mesmerising tapestry of masterful movie making.",The Exorcist III

199,rdoherty,"The film is scary in an intellectual, stylistic way.",9,28 April 1999,"This film is interesting in the ways it is not a traditional horror film. The film is largely concerned with hints of terror and brushes with evil. Nearly all the darkness of the film is established through the rather fine acting.  Of special note is the always reliable George C. Scott, and the often brilliant Brad Dourif in perhaps his best acting role of his career.Except for the ending of the picture, which is a disappointing special-effects extravaganza with no real justification, the movie moves at a slow pace of a horrific mystery where the always-consistent details add up one by one to the inescapable conclusion.  The film may manage to scare those who are generally unaffected by scary films, since it relies heavily on performance and moodiness as opposed to the more traditional gore and surprise.The film is a sequel to the original Exorcist, though it wisely ignores the regrettable Exorcist II.  The sound is top notch, and certain images (such as the human fly and the nurse stalking) are works of great cinema.A must for the person who has a long attention span.",The Exorcist III
200,jareth-5,This film really does scare people.,10,30 October 1999,"When Exorcist III was first released in British cinemas, I worked as a projectionist and was able on several occasions, to witness the audiences response while viewing it. The atmosphere inside the auditorium was tense and the audible response was clearly heard at appropriate moments. It was an experience just watching the audience watch the film.While they came out, you could hear the audience's comments saying how much the film had scared them. Forget films like the original Exorcist or The Blair Witch Project that were supposed to have upset the audience, I saw genuine fear created from Exorcist III.And yes, it scared me too!",The Exorcist III
201,Steve F,Comically underrated and overlooked.,9,5 July 1999,"This movie is possibly the most overlooked and underrated movie in the entire history of Western cinema. Sure, there are some unnecessary bits in it (particularly a scene involving Father Morning stuck to a ceiling with his limbs falling off one by one. It's supposed to be scary, but it's the funniest scene in the entire film), but overall, what we have here is, essentially, a trip into the mind of a psycho, a la Silence Of The Lambs, Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer, etc. Okay, so inhabiting this mind happens to be the same demon as in the original film, but also there is the spirit of a dead serial killer. The body they are inhabiting is that of Damien Karras, and this spurns a curious Lieutenant Kinderman to find out as much as possible about him, which leads him into discovering exactly what happened to Karras after the night of the fall.But as I was saying, it's underrated. A golden raspberry for worst actor? Comical. George C Scott's performance here might not be as memorable as that in Patton, but it's still an excellent performance.And Brad Dourif, sharing duties with Jason Miller as the sinister 'Patient X' is a much more effective demon here than in the 'Child's Play' series.The only complaint I'd have on the actors front, is that the brilliant Nicol Williamson is underused as Father Morning, but the character was added in at the last minute by producers.There are plenty of comic moments, too, notably a scene in the open psychiatric ward involving a man in a wheelchair flashing at the charge nurse. (Trust me, you have to see it, really).Sadly, it's probably due to the risible 'Exorcist II' that this film was so overlooked, and instantly assumed to be awful. But then again, whether people like movies or not is down to taste, I suppose.Try it. You might like it.",The Exorcist III
202,Dom-55,"Good, but it could have been marvellous",7,21 March 2000,"This film at least puts the Georgetown saga back on its rails after Exorcist 2. Mixing the horror of the first film with the humour of The Ninth Configuration, writer/director William Peter Blatty came up with a superb screenplay, based on the ""official"" Exorcist sequel novel Legion. George C Scott is superb as Lt Kinderman, a role played by Lee J Cobb in the original movie, who is on the lookout for a serial killer whose MO matches exactly that of a serial killer sent to the chair 15 years earlier (around the time of the McNeil exorcism). This ties in with strange goings-on in the disturbed ward of a nearby hospital, where one of the patients proves startlingly familiar to Kinderman.The film contains some truly great ""Oh sh*t!"" moments, a genuinely eerie atmosphere which plays to the audience's deepest fears and an ensemble cast whose performances hit the correct note every time.So what's wrong? Well, if you've read the screenplay, you'll realise that Morgan Creek, the production company, decided that there were no exorcisms, no spinning heads and there was a distinct lack of blood. Hence substantial cuts to the film were enforced to make way for an ending which uses the kind of splatter effects commonplace in the heyday of the Nightmare on Elm Street and Friday the 13th franchises.Had the film been made five years later, it probably would have been accused of ripping off an episode of The X Files. Certainly it has an X Files feel: and I mean that in the most positive way possible. One day, perhaps William Peter Blatty might be able to restore the film to its proper state, just as he and Friedkin have done to the original. Until then we must sit back and watch a film which, though very good, falls short of its potential.",The Exorcist III
203,acal1,A brilliant film which sends shivers down the spine!,10,19 January 2000,"This is a brilliant film and a great sequel to the first two films. In fact of the 3 Exorcist films it is my favourite and in my opinion the best of them.I have just ordered it and encourage others to do the same. George.C.Scott is brilliant as the sad and melancholic policeman trying to understand what is happening and at the same time save his friend Father Karras from eternal damnation. Brad Dourif is really haunting as the Gemini killer, and the feeling is unbelievable when this evil being in the form of the evil one confronts George.C.Scott and in the darkness of his cell sings with the voice of an angel reminding us all of how evil and decadent Satan is. The scenery and atmosphere is eerie and the music no less eerie.",The Exorcist III
204,Deckard70,Influential & Ahead Of It's Time?,8,20 October 2006,"Often referred to as underrated, THE EXORCIST III is indeed a stylish if slightly flawed thriller. Based on the director's own novel LEGION it should be noted as proving quite influential on many successful serial killer thrillers that followed after 1990, especially in my view SE7EN. Much of the Gemini killers gruesome modus operandi appears to have inspired a lot of John Doe's handy work in Andrew Kevin Walker's 1995 thriller. For example, witness the discovery and aftermath of Father Dyer's hospital bedside murder. The clinical and thorough procedure carried out by the Gemini killer here bears a stark resemblance to various scenes in SE7EN. And again in this scene, the discovery of ""It's A Wonderful Life"" on the wall has echoes of similar discoveries by the detectives in SE7EN. This is not a criticism of that later film though, far from it. It just merely emphasises what a shame it was that William Peter Blatty's film was so ignored simply for being slightly ahead of it's time. Both films remain thoroughly well acted and entertaining thrillers and truth be told SE7EN is the overall better film given it's brilliant climax, an area where EXORCIST III fails somewhat. As many have noted it appears the producers tacked on the exorcism scene, it certainly plays and feels that way. However, the concluding minutes of the film do deliver some nice shocks. The catatonic nurse certainly knows how to liven up a house visit.For me this film succeeds in it's brilliantly paced set pieces and not so much in it's sum parts. The scenes with George C. Scott and Ed Flanders are superbly played as are Scott's encounters with Nancy Fish's Nurse Allerton. The atmosphere, in no small way aided by the Georgetown setting, is suitably eerie as was very much the case in the original film THE EXORCIST. This is heightened early on in the confessional scene where we are privy to an unseen strangers confession to the serial killings. All we see here are interior shots of the confessional booth but on the priests side only. It's the chilling dialogue from the other side that drives the scene.The much talked about corridor scene during the nurse's night shift is a master class in suspense and spine tingling shock play. You never forget the first time you watch that scene. Even on repeated viewings, you know what's coming but the pay off hit's the button every time. It makes Ben Gardiner's eye popping head shock in Jaws seem like child's play and far more effective than the modern trend in horror films today of stabbing a orchestral hit to punctuate a false shock every few minutes. In fact there is little score in this film and many scenes feature periods of total silence. This perhaps is a technique Blatty picked up from Friedkin's directorship of the 1973 original. That film also benefited from sharp juxtapositions of sound against periods of silence. Certainly, given the expertise these sort of tricks are employed with, it's a shame Blatty hasn't directed more.Mention should also go to Brad Dourif whose scenes with Scott are engaging. Jason Miller's brief appearances are also good, again posing the question why he didn't show up in other good roles after the original film? As I say, the obviously bolted on exorcism scenes only serve to disappoint shifting what could have been an excellent thriller into a no man's land of horror hokum. As it is I rate THE EXORCIST III as very good example of a well acted suspense thriller that undoubtedly influenced other film makers and writers. Without the aforementioned flaws it could have rated as first class. Well worth a viewing.",The Exorcist III
205,j_mcmullin76,"Not as good as the original, however...",8,20 March 2001,"Although this movie does not have the outstanding punch of its predecessor it still has a lot going for it.The chilling ambiance that defines the original is still present and is used to great effect. I knew much less about this movie and therefore I was possibly ""scared"" more by certain scenes. I had heard so much about the original that I knew what was going to happen before I saw it.The banter in the scenes with George C. Scott and Ed Flanders (Father Dyer) is very entertaining and the dialogue is well written, natural (I felt that these two men were good friends off camera) and often darkly humorous.I thought that George C Scott was excellent as the tired, troubled cop who is out of his depth.Finally, some of the Brad Dourif's (Patient X) monologues, were excellent - chilling, venomous and spiteful: just what you want!!",The Exorcist III
206,bethsmailbag,This is what happens when the devil's not through with you....,10,2 October 2009,"Weak points: Some actors' voices seem louder than those around them. (Is this something deliberate that Blatty, as the director, is asking for?) George C. Scott overacts in some scenes. (Again, it could be Blatty's directing.) Nurse Allerton (Nancy Fish) horribly delivers her lines in the first ""interview"" between her and Scott. Strong points: Brad Dourif at his best and most frightening. Jason Miller makes me feel for him all over again as the tortured priest. And Ed Flanders. :) The hallway scene (as some other reviewer referred to it) is very scary. The old woman's voice in the confessional is creepy. And Mrs. Clalia speeding along on the ummm... floor is bizarre. There's much more to this film than I've mentioned and it truly is worth watching if you're a horror movie fan. (I watch it every fall around Halloween.) :)",The Exorcist III
207,kittykatrebellion,The true original,8,28 October 2006,"I happen to have read Blatty's original script for the Exorcist (it came out in paperback in 1974, titled ""William Peter Blatty on The Exorcist, From Novel to Film). It is an excellent explanation of why he would choose to direct Exorcist III himself. In Exorcist III, he incorporates many elements that were part of his script for The Exorcist that were rejected; especially the warm relationship that develops between the cop and the priest. In fact, in my reading the entire focus revolved around this relationship, with the Regan/possession story serving to bring these two characters together. Blatty gives this lost part of The Exorcist a new life in III, which really makes the film work (George C. Scott making a worthy Kinderman in the sad absence of Lee J. Cobb). Another element which is used to greater effect in III, is the quick glimpses and cut-aways of the evil doings and sacrilegious elements, which William Friedkin barely explored in I. All in all, I really like Exorcist III much better than either of its predecessors (II is tedious), with the exception of the special effects driven ending sequences (Scott is still able to hold his own, regardless). It easily stands on its own (despite the label ""III""), with interesting plot details, good pacing and fine acting. George C. Scott's telling of the ""fish"" story is worth repeated viewing on its own!",The Exorcist III

It creates a disturbing atmosphere and attempts to address the ""existence of God in the overwhelming evidence of evil"" problem. George C Scott gives a typical brilliant performance. The film confronts the issue of how does an atheist deal with the undeniable presence of evil in a modern world especially as the protagonist is approaching death himself. Genuinely eerie atmosphere overall with good direction by first-time director Blatty (probably because he wrote the books!).

The Douriff/Miller co-portrayal of Patient X (The Gemini Killer/Fr. Damien Karras) is powerful and convincing in its dramatic cohesiveness.

It is scary without becoming stupid and gory, and it is clever (especially in its dialogue and pacing) without being smug.George C. Scott is wonderful, as always. His character is a non-believing cop thrust into the middle of a terrifying investigation. Also, there is no way to prepare you for one particular death scene that has reached legendary status over the years. I knew it was coming, and it still scared the crap out of me.

I love the genre....I think that it offers more than any other....but there are no movies out there that can truly scare a horror movie afficionado.

George C Scott adds great power as his role as detective Kinderman. The old ladies in the film were creepy in and of themselves which added more terror. The music played was critical too,the 4th and fifth Excorcist movies recently made were not as terrifying with their soundtracks. I think Excorcist 3 is the most terrifying movie ever made.",The Exorcist III

Everyone else was just a throwaway character. The nurse's acting was horrible and completely unlikeable.With that being said, the first Exorcist was by far the best. The original was intended to be a serious, scary film but unfortunately the sequels have done the first Exorcist a complete disservice.Linda Blair even went on to make a parody movie of the Exorcist...how can you make a parody of your own movie!Just horrible.",The Exorcist III

Careful camera angles, lighting and excellent character development also enhance the films creepy feel. Watch for a scene where a nurse is working a night shift....Alone. One of the most chilling scenes I've ever seen in a horror film. Let's also remember you also have one of the most celebrated actors in history (George C. Scott)playing the pivotal role of Lt. Kinderman. I remember seeing the film in the theater when it opened and I remember the only reason I went to see it was because George C Scott was in the film. This gave the film its credibility.

221,badmutherfuc_ker,Best Horror Movie Ever Made,10,17 October 2016,"Everyone who is a hardcore fan of this film knows that the studio forced Blatty to make a lot of changes after he showed them the original cut. So apparently they are soon going to be releasing a directors cut without all the added on bullshit - the true original cut was apparently lost which is criminal but from what I've read through footage from video taped dailies they've been able to put together a version as close as possible to Blattys original vision. I don't think I've ever looked forward to a movie this much. Even though I'm quite confident Blattys version will be superior to the theatrical one I still give the theatrical cut a 10 as I have never seen a better horror film - even with all the studio post fuckery. Somehow whatever morons decided on golden raspberry nominees back in 1990 nominated George C. Scott for worst actor - did they even watch the movie?!? This movie made George C. Scott one of my all time favorite actors. A big part of what makes this movie superior to the original in my opinion is the quality of the acting - Scott, Flanders and Dourif are all amazing. The performances are so good - the dialogue is amazing. It's extremely clever, super funny in parts - especially the scenes with Scott and Flanders (The Carp Speech, the hospital visit) - and possesses several of the scariest scenes ever put on film that I'm aware of. It is way deeper than the original and admittedly more complex and more difficult to follow than the original or the average Hollywood film. We all know at least one person that can't even follow the plot of the latest spoon fed plot Hollywood blockbuster - this movie won't be for them - it is way too detailed and very subtle.

This is much more compelling than the first one, and while not as horrifying as the first, that is what makes it better.In Exorcist, there are a few terribly disturbing bits in there. Its more of shock value to me. Exorcist III does not have many shocking bits *Though the nurse getting gutted by one of the Gemini's legions was kind of a shock*, but it makes up well with the storyline.Oh, and George C. Scott plays Kinderman just as well as Cobb did in Exorcist I. His sometimes witty or sometimes sarcastic statements *Especially the ""What are Rabies"" bit near the beginning* sort of grew on me.Exorcist was also just plain gross at times. Exorcist III never had as much gross bits.I like EIII because its less disturbing than the original but not as terrible as the so called ""Exorcist II"". This is the true second Exorcist.Oh, and Brad Dourif was just plain awesome in this film. He was rather cunning in how he gave hints to Kinderman about how he *The Gemini* works. His voice is antagonizing yet rather nice- which makes it effective.Overall, this film is awesome. Those who did not watch it closely would not get it.My only complaint- and its just a nitpick- why did they not use the original title of Legion. This has no connection to the horrible sequel of Exorcist II, but the title might be slightly misleading. Exorcist: Legion might have been more effective.Overall, a less disturbing yet more compelling film than Exorcist. Those who expect Exorcist-like story lines will be saddened. Those who don't expect it to be formulaic *Like most sequels are* will love this film.",The Exorcist III

Most people expected to see scenes with a vomiting and head turning little girl but instead he evolved the horror from visual horror to horror of the human psyche.Which in my humble opinion is more scarier!!!! The writer of the original exorcist has both written and directed this priceless gem. Unfortunately we haven't heard much of him ever since, I think he only did the sublime Twinkle twinkle killer kane (Ninth configuration) and he directed a twilight zone episode.If you watched it a while ago and din't like it then please give it another chance now and watch it (again) You'll thank me later.",The Exorcist III

Yes im a big Exorcist (Not Exorcist2) fan, but Ex 3 to me is the film that should have been the sequel to the original. The plot picks up nicely from the original, the cast is superb, if you home in on the dialogue between George C. Scott and the others, it becomes a very humorous black comedy. Yet the scenes between George C. & Brad Dourif make the film outstanding, and make repeated fascinating serious viewing. The cuts from Dourif as the serial killer to the priest are superb and the final showdown riveting. These alone make this film worth at least a 8 rating.
