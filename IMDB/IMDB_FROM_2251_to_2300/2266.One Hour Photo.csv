0,Leofwine_draca,Robin Williams in a tour de force performance,7,22 September 2016,"A character study of obsession and growing madness, this is a film which makes up for a dearth of action by incorporating lots of suspense and subtle increases in tension into the running time. It's an exercise in psychological creepiness, boasting a near-flawless performance from Robin Williams, whose acting is introverted and subdued this time, instead of the awful loud comic character we have grown accustomed to from his earlier career. In fact, this might well be the best film of his long career. Without Williams, I'm not sure the film would be so successful in what it sets out to do; indeed, I can't imagine anyone else essaying the part as well as he does here: lonely, balding, blond-haired and totally alienated from the rest of society, he's a man without a life, whose obsession with a 'normal' family leads to tragedy.The surprising thing is that many scenes are riveting, despite not a lot happening. Moments when Williams faces the disapproval of his boss (Gary Cole, in another wonderfully nasty and impassioned turn) are engrossing, whilst the hotel set-piece at the finale keeps you guessing for as long as possible. Not sure I'm totally in favour of the (anti) climax, but at least it does away with cliché and presents things in a far more realistic light than we often see in the movies. Sober, surprisingly intelligent and insightful: worth watching for Williams alone.",One Hour Photo
1,SnoopyStyle,Creepy Robin Williams,6,30 March 2014,"Seymour Parrish (Robin Williams) is a lonely obsessed employee working at an one hour photo developer inside a big box store. He becomes fixated on the Yorkins (Connie Nielsen, Michael Vartan, Dylan Smith) and tries to insinuate himself into their lives. His boss Bill Owens (Gary Cole) starts to have problems with him.It's a quiet creepy performance from Robin Williams. Writer/director Mark Romanek is mostly known for music videos. It's a very plain movie. The style is very much like the big box store. It has a possibility of a more interesting movie. A creepy Robin Williams isn't enough. There needs to be more meat on the bone. There has to be a story. The ending payoff is simply not big enough. Instead of a powerful explosion, the movie is going for poetic weirdness. This is an interesting performance in search of a more explosive story.",One Hour Photo
2,Hitchcoc,Williams Sells It,8,22 May 2012,"Robin Williams, one of the funniest people on the planet, has made a career of playing some very unpleasant people. In this one, he works at a Fotomat (now nearly extinct) and become the stalker of a family that brings their films to him for development. Not only does he stalk them, he knows everything about them, their birthday parties, their fights, their sporting events, etc. Of course, at some point he is going to inject himself into their lives. Fortunately, the scrip writers used some restraint and made this play out the way it should have (I won't' spoil this for you). Suffice it to say that the trip is a scary one and we can't help but feel our flesh creep a bit. We also are made aware of his loneliness and his dysfunctional existence. He is a multidimensional figure, as quirky as one can get. After seeing ""The Social Network"" recently, I have to also say that we have created a societal voyeurism in our culture. This further shows how fragile our privacy is and how we are willing to sell it to the highest bidder.",One Hour Photo
3,Prismark10,One Hour Photo,6,21 March 2020,"Well no wonder the future of photography went digital after this movie.Robin Williams was in a phase where he stepped away from comedy to playing psychopaths.Sy Parrish (Robin Williams) is a loner. He lives alone and he is dedicated to his job as a photo developer inside a supermarket.It seems Sy is obsessed with Nina Yorkin (Connie Nielsen.) To him the Yorkins are a perfect family.However when he develops her husband Will's photos that show him having an affair. Sy moves on from being creepy to being manic.One Hour Photo is about a man who unravels. Sy is also fired from his job and Will's affair shatters his illusion of a perfect family unit which he would like to play a part in.The movie shies away from being a slaughter fest. There is some allusion to The Shining with a dream sequence.It is a slow burner which becomes increasingly deranged. I did find the Yorkin's bland. There is a question mark as to who actually took the intimate photos of Will and his mistress.Without William's performance, this would be a forgettable movie.",One Hour Photo
4,classicsoncall,"""No one ever takes a photograph of something they want to forget.""",7,14 October 2021,"You come to understand just how mentally unstable Robin Williams' character is, when Seymour Parrish returns home from work one evening and settles down to watch a little television. The cut to that full wall of pictures of the Yorkin family packs a gut blow to anyone who thinks Sy was just an overly friendly clerk at the local Savmart photo counter. His obsession played itself out in various ways, like reading the same book he spied in Mrs. Yorkin's (Connie Nielsen) possession, and watching son Jake's (Dylan Smith) soccer practice. I tried imagining the conversation he would have had with Jake's coach if the young boy hadn't told him not to bother; I would like to have seen that play out. I think it was Jake's refusal of the Neon Genesis figure that might have been Sy's turning point, a key moment that spurred him on to take things to the extreme he did. His obsession to become part of a family backfired to the extent that he virtually destroyed it. This was one of the times Robin Williams set aside his comic genius and decided to explore the mind of a psychopath in a creepy and chilling portrayal. To the extent that he brings out the shivers, you can be glad that his 'Uncle Sy' isn't part of your family.",One Hour Photo
5,lee_eisenberg,Never doubt Robin Williams' sinister abilities in movies.,7,20 September 2005,"Following the sappy box office duds ""Jakob the Liar"" and ""Bicentennial Man"", Robin Williams probably decided that he needed to do some darker roles. Therefore, you might say that 2002 was his comeback year: he not only did his first tour in fifteen years (which I saw) - he also made some good movie choices, with ""Death to Smoochy"" and ""One Hour Photo"" (I still haven't seen ""Insomnia""). In ""One Hour Photo"", he plays photo developer Sy Parrish. Sy seems like a pretty routine person. But beneath that nondescript exterior lies something totally different. Sy has been developing the Yorkins' pictures for a long time, to the point where he is getting very interested in them. And by ""interested"", I mean ""a lot more interested that most people would prefer"". By which I mean that he's starting to spy on them.Yes, it all sounds pretty creepy, but the movie does end on a good note. No matter how you interpret it, it just goes to show that no one truly knows anybody. And anyway, it was good to see Robin Williams doing a new kind of role.",One Hour Photo
6,jboothmillard,One Hour Photo,8,17 March 2005,"This is one of the best and most creepy thrillers I have ever seen. Robin Williams plays another great non-comedy role (just like Insomnia) as Sy Parrish, a knowledgeable photo developer at a local supermarket. He has been developing the photographs of the Yorkin family, from the films given by mother and wife Nina Yorkin (Connie Nielsen) since young Jake (Dylan Smith) was a baby. What they and everyone else doesn't know is that at his house his wall is covered with this family's photos! He basically wants to be part of this family, even though he knows he can't, so you can slightly sympathise with his loneliness. When the supermarket manager Bill Owens (Gary Cole) finds out fires him for theft, he has one more week at work, so he starts having a breakdown because he won't ""see"" the family anymore. But then it gets worse, in his last developing he discovers the father and husband of the family Will Yorkin (Michael Vartan) has been having an affair with Maya Burson (Erin Daniels), through some photos that he finds. So he exacts angry revenge by first slipping this affair photo in the family's photo envelope, and then he finds where the Dad and this other woman hang out. When he finds them at the hotel room, he threatens to stab them (with a stolen knife) if they do not pose in pornographic poses (and smile), this is the most uncomfortable scene. In the end, he gets arrested for stalking the manager's daughter and the final shot is him in a Yorkin family photo, but is it his imagination or reality? Also starring Paul Hansen Kim as Yoshi Araki, Eriq La Salle as Detective James Van Der Zee and Clark Gregg as Detective Paul Outerbridge. This is what I like to refer to as the nut-case film, like Falling Down, Fatal Attraction and Misery. Robin Williams was number 19 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars. Very good!",One Hour Photo
7,Woodyanders,A chillingly plausible and absorbing thriller,8,18 July 2007,"Robin Williams gives a remarkably bold, subtle and stunning performance as sad and socially maladjusted convenience store worker Sy ""The Photo Guy"" Parrish. Sy has an unhealthy fixation on the seemingly perfect Yorkin family: loving mother Nina (a fine Connie Nielson), faithless, neglectful husband Will (the solid Michael Vartan), and sweet son Jacob (adorable Dylan Smith). When Sy gets fired from his job and discovers that Will has been cheating on Nina, his idealized perception of the Yorkins gets destroyed and he goes off the deep end into total despair and madness. Writer/director Mark Romanek relates the chilling and arresting story with exceptional precision and assurance; he does an especially expert job of vividly evoking a totally mundane and believable everyday working class reality which in turn makes the considerable suspense that much more powerful and gut-wrenching. Moreover, the central theme about violation of privacy and how loneliness can cause someone to go crazy adds additional resonance and even poignancy to the plot. Williams' astonishingly complex portrayal of the creepy, anal and obsessive, yet tragic and pitiable Sy holds the picture together and keeps things engrossing throughout. Kudos are also in order for the sterling supporting cast: Gary Cole as mean and overbearing store manager Bill Owens, Eriq La Salle as diligent detective James Van Der Zee, and Erin Daniel as Will's fetching mistress Maya Burson. Jeff Cronenworth's sharp, sparkling cinematography and the shuddery, pulsating score by Reinhold Heil and Johnny Kilmek are likewise up to par. A superior thriller.",One Hour Photo
8,ccthemovieman-1,Another Example Of A Comedian Who Can Be Effectively Serious,10,2 February 2006,"Robin Williams once again proves how good comedians can be at serious drama roles. Williams is especially good at playing creepy characters, as he has done several times in the last decade.Here, he plays ""Sy, the photo guy,"" a lonely employee in the photo department of a suburban Target/Walt-Mart//K-Mart-whatever who lives vicariously through a nice family, whose family pictures he has developed and printed for years. So, when Sy discovers the husband of that family is cheating, he takes it personally....and gets involved.This was a fascinating portrait of a deranged man and a wonderfully photographed movie. The colors in here are astounding at times and the camera-work innovative with some neat angles. The suspense of the story builds and builds one gets that old film-noir feeling of impending doom.This has a different ending, though, than most old film noirs, not exactly what the viewer might think will happen.This is a film that, as far I know, never got much publicity, but it's a gem. Williams is outstanding in his role and the hour-and-a-half you invest in this movie flies by.",One Hour Photo
9,rmax304823,Behind the smiley face.,8,6 September 2003,"SPOILERS.Freud called it ""sublimation"" when you convert your neurotic anxiety into a constructive channel such as your work or your art, and that's what Robin Williams shows his character doing here, in a fine subdued dramatic performance. People bring their film to him to be developed in the SavMart.And although he's nothing more than a smiley face to them, they are much more to him. He knows them all, their quirks, their joys, and their families. In fact he runs off an extra copy of family photos -- children playing, wedding ceremonies, vacations, the usual dull stuff -- and takes them home and tapes them across an entire wall of his apartment. When he's not watching The Simpsons (a family show) on TV, he's sitting back in his chair glowing with pleasure as he looks at his wall.Not that he's entirely happy. He laments the fact (in a literate and observant narration) that if we were to judge families just from the snapshots they take, it would be misleading. People just take snaps of joyous moments. They neglect everyday subjects like the used bandaid, the wasp on the jello, the edges of the sofa cushions -- things nobody pays attention to, like himself. What a well-done movie for a first-time director. One notices first the use of lighting and color. The SavMart in which Williams works is all fluorescent light and sterility -- the dominant hues are blue, white, and cream. The only advancing colors we see, warm reds and oranges, are associated with the family that occupies most of his attention, the Yorkins. His home, like his workplace, is so sterile and tidy that it makes an ordinary space look like McSorley's Old Ale House.The family snaps bloom like a spring garden of flamelike orange. The wall that they cover is the only sign of life in Williams' home, aside from the pet hamster that runs endless miles in its silly circular cage. If the film were any more ""symbolic"" it would have to be European. The actors wear matching wardrobes. Williams' uniform is flawless for its purpose. A blue vest, starchy gray shirt and matching tie, gray trousers, and a pair of those ugly plastic shoes with thick gum soles -- all gray. Williams is first-rate in the part, not just his bland professional behind-the-counter smile or his tentative voice but his movements, his body language. It's stilted, stiff, robotic, as if requiring an immense amount of effort to control. The black detective is good as well, if more sympathetic than we'd expect from an ordinary cop. And so is Connie Nielson, whom Williams takes to following around. (Why not?)The director has done a fine job. Camera movements are generally measured pans, and shots are held for enough time for us to absorb their contents. (What a relief after having been so often zapped in recent movies.) The influence of David Lynch, the Coen brothers, and Stanley Kubrick is there -- but not to an objectionable extent. The director is fond of the kind of brightly lighted scenes that Kubrick used to find so attractive. (See the scene between Nicholson and the waiter in the men's room in ""The Shining"" for an example of what I mean.) Originality shows in this movie. A less thoughtful flick would have -- could EASILY have -- included the butchery of two guilty people in the nude.Or -- when Williams has a nightmare -- he COULD have screamed, shot up from his bed, and shoved his face jarringly into the camera, but he doesn't. The nightmare, by the way, has blood squirting in buckets from Williams' eyes. There are lots of eyes in this movie. Williams at one point interrupts a lecture on eye surgery. And lots of camera lenses. The only thing that leave me puzzled a bit is the denouement, in which Williams quizzes the black detective and tells him he's a good father, and that he'd never make his children do sick things. Williams' face twists with angry distress as he says this, and the detective comments, ""I think I understand, Sy."" I'd rather NOT understand, if what we're meant to understand is that Williams' father was a child abuser. That's too cheap a shot to fit into the rest of this superior story.",One Hour Photo
10,BA_Harrison,Robin Williams develops an obsession and exposes his dark side.,8,16 September 2010,"Zany comedic actor Robin Williams goes against type to star as slightly unhinged photo technician Seymour 'Sy' Parrish, who over the years has formed an unhealthy obsession with the seemingly perfect family of suburban wife and mother Nina Yorkin (Connie Nielsen), a regular customer at his lab.When Sy loses his job, and then discovers that Nina's husband Will (Michael Vartan) is sleeping with work colleague Maya Burson (Erin Daniels), the loner's fantasy of becoming part of a perfect family unit is shattered, and he embarks on a crusade to expose the affair and punish the guilty parties.A tense study of a fractured psyche brought about through severe childhood trauma and long term social inadequacy, One Hour Photo provides its talented star with the role of a lifetime, one that requires the usually madcap performer to be, at turns, likable, pitiable, creepy and absolutely chilling. The amazingly versatile Williams pulls off this trick with seeming ease, giving a thoroughly convincing performance throughout.Writer/director Mark Romanek also deserves much praise for his sharp script and stylish visuals, but should be particularly commended for not succumbing to Hollywood-itis: his main character isn't just another Hannibal Lector or Patrick Bateman, but rather a very real individual, deserving of compassion and understanding. This fact seems to bother some reviewers here on IMDb, who clearly wanted the guy to become a total monster and go on a killing spree at the end of the film, but I'm glad Romanek took the more subtle route—it makes the film a refreshingly different and more satisfying experience overall.",One Hour Photo
11,moonspinner55,"Uncertain development, murky returns...",4,28 May 2007,"Wimpering suspense-drama with variable performances and writing. Robin Williams is nearly unrecognizable as a friendless photo developer in a shopping center whose not-so-innocent obsession with a seemingly happy family leads to tragedy. I'm not sure why 'lonely' always equals 'sociopathic' in these kinds of movies--if it's for dramatic content, ""One Hour Photo"" comes up doubly short, as there isn't much substance in this script nor is there an emotional pay-off at the finale. Williams, his lips tightened into a grimace, displays a convincingly false happy-front; with his alert eyes and quick little movements, he gives this character more depth than writer-director Mark Romanek probably envisioned (it's certainly not there in the script). Romanek is very flashy, giving us canny snippets of character quirks, but he is neither interested in being enlightening (except for a brief treatise on the history of photography) nor entertaining, and the fantasies and dream sequences are poor excuses for narrative content. ** from ****",One Hour Photo
12,blanche-2,Excellent performance by Robin Williams,7,19 March 2010,"An up and coming writer and director, Mark Romanek, wrote and directed the 2002 film, ""One Hour Photo"" starring Robin Williams. Williams plays Sy, a deeply disturbed man who runs the photo development booth at a discount store. He is obsessed with the Yorkin family, whose photos he has been developing since the son, Jake, was an infant. Having no life of his own, Sy parks his car outside the Yorkin house, runs into Mrs. York at a mall food court, and makes extra copies of their photos for his wall at home. Then he discovers, through another customer's photos, that Mr. Yorkin (Alias star Michael Vartan) is having an affair.There is a surprising lack of dialogue in this film and some very stark cinematography, which points up Sy's isolation in the world. The film is very well done.One quibble I have is when Sy's boss (Gary Cole) questions Sy about the discrepancy in prints sold versus the excessive amount of prints made by the AGFA machine. Given how long Sy has been making extra copies, it seems strange that someone is just noticing this now.Williams' acting is excellent, proving again that many comics can do drama very well. Eriq LaSalle, formerly of ""E.R."" plays a police detective.Without Romanek's fine touches, this would have been on the level of a Lifetime TV movie. Thanks to his sense of style, it isn't.",One Hour Photo
13,Quinoa1984,Possibly one of the best films of the year so far,10,22 March 2002,"Mark Romanek, usually a music video director, takes a jab at the feature film department and makes an uncannily (yet righteously) awkward, yet extremely well crafted dramatic thriller of a movie with One Hour Photo.Robin Williams gives what could be an Oscar nominated performance from my standpoint, as a lonely and obsessive photo shop worker who it seems is a bit 'head over heels' (in the crazy sense) over a family of three that has sent their pictures to his department for the past eleven years (and un-beknownst to them all of those pictures are glued onto his living room wall from eleven years). Williams tries to always think they are the perfect family, but when he begins to see different, his obsession goes another step.A very creepy sense of realism is brought to the whole tone of the film and it works splendidly when brought along side Williams' performance, which is at times observant (the keen narration), sympathetic and totally out of sync with the rest of the true world. And in the end I felt I had witnessed an original work that pumps with greatness in it's photo shop veins. Also stars Connie Nielson, Michael Vartan as the husband and wife, and Gary Cole as Williams' boss, all quite good supporting performances. Grade: between A+ and A",One Hour Photo
14,wes-connors,Mark Romanek snaps Robin Williams' mind,7,20 July 2009,"Lonely department store ""One Hour Photo"" guy Robin Williams (as Seymour ""Sy"" Parrish) lives vicariously through the pictures he develops for what seems like the perfect family: ""Full frontal"" father Michael Vartan (as William ""Will"" Yorkin), beautiful wife Connie Nielsen (as Nina Yorkin), and their cute nine-year-old son Dylan Smith (as Jakob ""Jake"" Yorkin). Soon, Mr. Williams is stalking the family; he watches young Smith play baseball, meets Ms. Nielsen at the Galleria food mart for lunch, and parks his car outside their home after work. When Williams discovers Mr. Vartan may not be the world's best father, he goes ""Psycho"".Excellent direction by Mark Romanek, complimented by Williams' creepy performance; this film succeeds in maintaining a quiet, mostly suggestive horror throughout. There are some ways it could be tighter. Some examples: Maya's pictures (who took them?) should have been suggestive solo shots of the couple, which Williams intends to ""unite"" in the hotel room. Jake's perceptions about ""Sy"" are alluded to early on, but never expanded; they are confirmed by an excellent ""point-of-view"" shot of Williams' car in his rear view mirror. There is no follow-up. This should have been the moment the boy convinces his mother the man is a dangerous stalker. And, while ""The Day the Earth Stood Still"" is a great old movie, why not substitute one that compliments ""Sav-Mart"", like ""Invasion of the Body Snatchers""? ******* One Hour Photo (1/13/02) Mark Romanek ~ Robin Williams, Michael Vartan, Connie Nielsen",One Hour Photo

17,hitchcockthelegend,"I was here, I existed and someone cared about me enough to take my picture.",8,30 September 2012,"One Hour Photo is written and directed by Mark Romanek. It stars Robin Williams, Connie Nielsen, Michael Vartan, Dylan Smith, Gary Cole and Eriq La Salle. Music is scored by Reinhold Heil and Johnny Klimek and cinematography by Jeff Cronenweth.Sy Parrish (Williams) is a loner photo technician at SavMart's one hour photo shop who becomes obsessed with a family whose photographs he develops....No one takes a photograph of something they want to forget.2002 was a stellar year for Robin Williams, it saw him give two dramatically potent performances that dampen down the bile spewed up by those who haven't been able to forgive him his comedy excesses. Insomnia has (rightly) found a more appreciative audience since 2002 because of the rise of its director, one Christopher Nolan. One Hour Photo, though, still seems to be striving for recognition for its qualities, in fact, for its understated qualities.It's evident now that many have gone into the film expecting some psycho stalker movie, and subsequently have been disappointed to find One Hour Photo is nothing of the sort. What unfolds is a sedately paced story of a fractured mind, of a loner who is so detached from society he imagines himself being part of a family, by way of his job, that he thinks is perfect. When the family of his selection turns out to not be a bastion of Americana, the little thread in his head clinging to sanity finally breaks, and then......Here's the problem. This is no slasher, people need to understand that mental illness or isolation from society does not mean psycho death killer, and thus Romanek's film becomes an observational character study of someone detached from realism. Creepiness permeates the picture, big time, but you shouldn't be putting this in the horror genre. Romanek always holds the upper hand, structured as it is, we the audience find ourselves holding on to see just how far Sy Parrish went with his pursuit of family harmony? With that comes the question of if the finale delivers substance? Well that depends on if you want red blood histrionics or brainy grey area.There were cuts and studio interference, and in the finale an explanation for Parrish's mental issues reeks of a writer being ""handed"" a solution by the studio paying his bills. Yet this is mature pot-boiling stuff, a film that dares to simmer and not let the pot spill over for multiplex appeasement. While Williams is nothing short of terrific, an edgy and understated performance that only makes us lament that he didn't do more of these portrayals at his peak. 8/10",One Hour Photo

Also Connie Nielsen and Michael Vartan come across with no personality--it's not their fault--the script is against them.  Also the movie gets very unpleasant at the end.But it, more or less, works because of Willaims--he's just great as Sy...charming and creepy at the same time...he's just fantastic.

20,Boba_Fett1138,One of the most original thrillers in recent years.,7,11 January 2007,"""One Hour Photo"" uses an original concept and has an original approach.The story is about real-life and real-life characters. The thriller elements in the movie don't really ever feel forced and the movie actually has a pretty realistic atmosphere and certain tension. It's mainly thanks to the actors that the movie works out this way.Guess that no one ever really thought about it but the guy who develops your photos for years, knows more about you and your personal life than you would really want to. This movie shows what can happen if a developer gets obsessed with your personal life and feels that he is- or at least should be a part of your 'normal' life.I'm probably making the movie sound more 'thriller-like' than it in fact is. Yes, ""One Hour Photo"" is a thriller but not one with constant suspension or an haunting atmosphere.This is probably due to the approach of the movie, that is original and refreshing but also is a killer for the much needed formulaic thriller ingredients. The main character of the movie is the 'psychophate' himself. Instead of seeing him as a monster, you can't help feeling compassion for him. Sy Parrish is a lonely guy but kind guy and everything that he has in the world is his job. He has never been married and is probably a single all his life and he has no family. His loneliness and sadness becomes very sensible in the movie and you really start to feel compassion for the character and want him to be happy. In that regard ""One Hour Photo"" is probably a better dramatic character movie than a thriller.It's absolutely thanks to Robin Williams that the main character works out so well in the movie. He's highly convincing in this serious role. Somewhat of course he very rarely ever plays. He really is the one that carries the movie and here is also were one of the problems of the movie lays. All of the other characters are pushed to the back. It doesn't make the story work out as powerful and tense as it could had been. The Yorkin's are a pretty good movie-family but their fears and their reactions toward the weird- and behavior of Sy at certain points of the movie gets highly underdeveloped. It's probably the reason why it isn't the most effective thriller around, though it's absolutely an original and great one to watch.The storytelling is for most part good. It takes its time to draw out the character and set up the situations. It shows how the character slowly slips from being obsessed, to being a dangerous and psychotic stalker, when things are turning against him. It's definitely true that the movie goes a bit overboard toward the ending when everything happens fast and there is build up to an ending that just can't life up to its build up.It's definitely a well directed movie with a good visual style and some great shot and effective sequences, though Mark Romanek obviously still has a lot of learning to do. But the basis is here already notable in the movie and the basis is real good, so that promises a lot for his future movies.Highly recommendable due to its originality and performances from the cast but just don't watch this movie expecting a tense stalker-thriller, that will bring you to the edge of the seat.7/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",One Hour Photo
21,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,"Utterly event-less, but apart from that, not bad",7,13 June 2008,"This may make you think twice about having the local place process your photos. This was neither something I had huge expectations for nor figured would turn out a major let-down. Just know that what I write in this review is not out of bitterness. With that said, this isn't a downright poor film. The big complaint I have about it is that, for the entire duration, from beginning to end... *nothing*, and I am not using hyperbole, not anything whatsoever, actually happens. The plot is fine, and save for one line obviously done to deliver exposition early on(apart from which, there are only a few problems with the dialog), it's told decently. The pacing is OK. Acting is good, though I've seen both Vartan and Williams do better elsewhere. The latter's character is fairly well-written, if there could have been considerably more on-screen development(and he's the one who was most fleshed out). I don't know exactly what the ending is supposed to be. Cinematography and editing are well-done. Romanek has evidently barely directed movies apart from this. I won't go out of my way to watch his other work, but I won't actively avoid it, either. I'm not making it my life's mission to view this again, but I won't have a problem with doing so. There is a little blood, some disturbing material, some graphic sexuality/nudity and the language isn't exactly restrained(I'm referring more to how strong it can be than its quantity). I recommend this to fans of Mark Romanek, thrillers and/or the other people who worked on this. 7/10",One Hour Photo

And then there is the type like Sy Parrish (Robin Williams) in ""One Hour Photo."" He's the kind of psycho that is weak, slithery, pathetic and in need of love. These kinds of psychos are uncomfortable to watch. You neither love nor hate them though they usually do something to put themselves firmly on one side or the other.Sy worked in one of the many industries/professions killed by the smart phone: film development. Back in the olden days, before digital cameras, you had to trek to the photomat in order to have your precious pictures developed. This activity cost money in film and development, so you couldn't be flippant with what pictures you took, you only took pictures of people and things you really wanted. And because someone had to develop and print these photos other people saw your pictures even before you did.Our friend Sy had an obsession with the Yorkins: Nina (Connie Nielsen), Will (Michael Vartan), and little Jake (Dylan Smith). He would print an extra set of all of their photos to take home and collect in order to fill the void in his miserable lonely life. He reached gold level stalker status when he even showed up at Jake's soccer practice totally unannounced, unexpected, and uninvited. At first glance it seemed that Sy desired Nina, but that wasn't it; he desired to be a part of their family. It was cringey and weird.This was a distinctive shift in Williams career. He clearly wanted to experiment with being the bad guy hence he did ""Insomnia"" and this movie both in the same year. Robin Williams is good even if ""One Hour Photo"" isn't. I don't quite know what I was expecting, but I wanted a little more. ""One Hour Photo"" is a nice suspenseful movie that I will only remember because Robin Williams played the bad guy.",One Hour Photo
23,ferguson-6,The movie formerly known as prints,8,3 September 2002,"Greetings again from the darkness.  And I do mean darkness.  Not sure if this one is more about lonliness, mental illness or life as an illusion.  So many ways to analyze the script, I think it best left to each filmgoer to think about it their own way.  Director Mark Romanek had a nice cast to support the mostly harrowing performance of Robin Williams.  Only a couple of times does Williams go over the top, but mostly he plays the creepy Sy the Photo Guy to perfection.  Copnnie Nielsen (superb in ""Rushmore"") and Michael Vartan (""Never Been Kissed"") are the blissfully yuppie couple where you can't tell the book by the cover.  Eriq LaSalle as the detective mostly raises an eyebrow here and there to emote.  My one complaint with the cast is the stereotyped Gary Cole.  He should stick to made for TV movies, although he almost pulls off the discount store manager role.  Yet, he is too cheesy even for this.  Romanek has obviously studied Hitchcock and Kubrick; however, I had the feeling he also studied the Hitchcock-copying DePalma in many shots.  The stark feel of the Sav-Mart and specifically the photo lab make for wonderful back drops and contrast for the earthy colors and textures of the Yorkin's home.  Overall a decent psychological thriller, but could have been great with a little more script effort.  Too many ""easy outs"" for a true thriller - especially the ending.",One Hour Photo

Gary Cole, Eriq La Salle: Photographs capture time and memories but it only takes a short time for those moments to be invaded. Robin Williams plays photo clerk Sy Parrish who narrates the film giving viewers a bit of history on the word ""snap-shot"" as a hunting term. He makes extra prints and imagines himself amongst them as uncle Sy while plastering his apartment walls with photographs. He also knows that the husband id having an affair because he examined the photographs. He is an intruder who hides his knowledge behind a friendly smile. Great setup with analysis of his work and home life leading to a powerful ending. Director Mark Romanek graces the film with shots that suggest invasion of the mind. Powerful performance by Williams whose profession is both his doorway to acceptance and his reality to consequence and instability. Connie Nielsen is also strong as the mother whose romantic void is obvious when Williams knows what she doesn't. Michael Vartan as her husband needed more depth but he receives his regret in the most deliberate fashion. Gary Cole plays Williams's boss who pushes him to the limits. Eriq La Salle is superb as a detective whose final scene brings proper resolution and understanding. Loneliness is something nobody wishes to capture on film. Score: 9 / 10",One Hour Photo
25,FlashCallahan,All I did was take pictures......,8,30 November 2014,"Sy Parrish has been doing photo development for 20 years. He has a vast knowledge of modern photography and develops photos at a local department store for a living. But he lives a sad and lonely life and begins spying on the Yorkin family, his most regular customers who seem to have everything in the world. Sy begins to feel that he wants to be in the Yorkin's life, but when he discovers that the Yorkins are not as perfect as they seem.He becomes obsessed with exposing the imperfections of the Yorkin family that could tear them apart.....He won the Oscar for GWH, and he may have been suitably sinister in Insomnia, but here he does something so so special, that, in my opinion, it's his career best performance. We all know what Sy is doing is totally wrong and he has severe mental health problems, but the way Williams depict his persona, you cannot help but sympathise for him, thus making him appear to be the victim of the narrative structure.Of course the wonderful writing and direction helps a lot, but his performance is so unique, I'm sure if this had a bigger distribution, he would have had a lot more award recognition than he did.Its scary, and at the same time, quite sad to know that someone can be that lonely enough to make their obsession almost reality, but at the same time, thinking that he is doing it for the greater good.Very good.",One Hour Photo

And if you can get past the HUGE plot-hole that he could ever steal duplicates of the photos he makes for YEARS and never get caught (granted that IS a bit much to swallow), as where as a few other plot holes, none as glaring, you'll find that this is an enjoyable enough thriller.

Robin Williams can make you feel sorry and empathy for this man who is obviously desperate for a family of his own or something to connect with in life.

29,mm-39,Original,8,16 October 2002,Spoiler!It is nice to see a movie that is original and has not been done before. Robin Williams plays another weirdo with past demons in this film.  I'm starting to wonder if this is his new type of character.  Williams who has a bad family past adopts a photo perfect family who are not perfect that have their own demons.  He finds out about their infidelities and it cracks him. He goes over the deep end.  I like how the store he works at has all the similarities of Wal-Mart;  they called it Sav-Mart.  I am surprised Wal-Mart hasn't sued them.  The employees even wear the same blue vest. This guy has trouble coping with reality.  A whole bunch of outside events catch up to him and the viewer gets to find out if he is a violent man.  Watch the film and find out.  I am glad I went to see this one in the theatre as I was pleasantly surprised.  8/10,One Hour Photo
30,DICK STEEL,A Nutshell Review: One Hour Photo,8,15 November 2010,"I grew up with Robin Williams movies in a way, watching him on the telly with his Mork and Mindy series when I was a kid, and following almost all his films should they make it to the big screen here. Everyone knows he's quite the live wire comedian, so it's probably groundbreaking each time he gravitates towards more dramatic, serious fare such as Dead Poets Society and The Night Listener, with even rarer turns as negative characters, such as that in Christopher Nolan's Insomnia, and One Hour Photo.Written and directed by Mark Romanek, the film has as a central character, somebody in the background, easily forgotten, never a hero and frankly someone that we don't really care about unless we know them personally prior. Robin Williams junks his jokey side, and plays a quiet loner who works at a megamart as the one-hour photo lab tech guy who processes your photographs. Yes it's Year 2002, so cameras of the digital type were not that prevalent, and surely a film with a premise of this nature probably can no longer use this setting because it doesn't exist, at least not in a widespread manner. If you, like me, have seen the demise of this part of the photo industry, may have a tinge of sadness since you're likely to have built up some keen rapport with the person who through the development of your film, likely to have entered your personal circle of trust.And part of the brilliance of the film is how detailed it is to show how films were processed back then, from the small film roll into negatives on which photographs get printed on. William's Seymour ""Sy"" Parrish narrates this delicate process, which tells us his personality and his approach in life, chillingly meticulous and taking pride in his profession to deliver the best of his services, where memorizing facts and figures of his customers seem to be part of his edge in delivering customer service, never betraying that hint of misappropriation where he siphons off extra prints of the Yorkin family photos to feed his obsession.Working 11 years on the same job, he has seen the Yorkins - husband Will (Michael Vartan), wife Nina (Connie Nielsen) and son Jakob (Dylan Smith) grow in the community, and they soon become his family of choice, a unit that he craves for but knows he has missed the boat and can never enjoy what this family has in its ties. So the next best thing is to creepily collect mementos, and plots to be as close as he can to members of the family, stalking Nina even and trying extremely hard to connect at any level through a little bit of ingenious social engineering.A lesser story will have this degenerate into something of the Fatal Attraction kind, exploiting Sy's loneliness into something dangerous and threatening the family direct. But here's where Romanek's story succeeds in providing a breath of fresh air, where that tinge of danger becomes a suspenseful thriller, keeping us constantly wondering just what sort of edge does Sy get pushed over, and rolling his disgraceful past into the mix as well in one fell swoop, in desiring his utopia of what a family is to be maintained at that virginal level, keeping it perfect.It didn't go down the road of the mediocre or the typical, but kept things open especially in the final moments of conversation between Sy and detective Van Der Zee (Eriq La Salle), where we get the rug pulled from under our feet, yet allowing things to swing either way, depending on whether we desire to sympathize with Sy, or prefer that it be something more bleak than it already is. One thing's for sure though, with the advent of technology, the potential for something like this has moved from the photo-studio where a select few employees have privy to the photos you send for development, or this gets unwittingly revealed through the lack of securing our digital photos on social networking sites.Robin Williams is a one man tour de force, and he disappears effortlessly into the role, hidden behind the shy, lonely facade, becoming somewhat of an an eerie avenging angel type who sees his utopia being destroyed, and wants to do something about it. And the misc-en- scene gets carefully crafted to support this, from the music, sets and the spot on creation of mood that gets to crawl under your skin. His performance alone is astounding, and he totally owned the role and made this film come alive. Watch this to see what Robin Williams can do outside of comedy, and for Mark Romanek story and dare in taking Williams out of his comfort zone. Recommended!",One Hour Photo

I do consider that it did not succeed to make me feel surprised. Movies should do that. I saw the commercial, I saw the movie and , throughout the length of it, I knew what was going to happen, even if the end was less violent that anyone would have believed.I knew what the main character felt, I knew what the two married people must have felt like and they acted upon their respective situations and feelings. There was nothing to make the viewer change in any way, so watching the movie lost its point.Great performance by Robin Williams, but not a good movie. Boring, too.",One Hour Photo
34,JamesHitchcock,"Little Man, What Now?",8,18 May 2008,"In her novel ""The Death of the Heart"" Elizabeth Bowen wrote ""Not for nothing do we invest so much of ourselves in other people's lives- or even in momentary pictures of people we do not know. It cuts both ways; the happy group inside the lighted window, the figure in the long grass in the orchard seen from the train stay and support us in our dark hours"". ""One-Hour Photo"" is a film about someone who invests almost all of himself in other people's lives. Sy Parrish works behind the photo counter of a large suburban supermarket and has spent the last twenty years of his life developing other people's snapshots. Sy is a lifelong bachelor, with no wife, family or romantic interest in his life. His one passion seems to be for his job, which he takes very seriously, doing his utmost to ensure that every customer receives a perfect set of photographs. He prides himself that his laboratory is ""the best mini-lab in the state"", and his philosophy can perhaps be summed up in the following words:- ""And if these pictures have anything important to say to future generations, it's this: I was here. I existed. I was young, I was happy, and someone cared enough about me in this world to take my picture"". Sy might seem like the perfect employee, but there is a darker side to his character. He has formed a great attachment to one particular family, the Yorkins- handsome dad Will, pretty young mom Nina and their cute young son Jake. He does not just see the family as customers- he has befriended them and appointed himself their ""Uncle Sy"". What the Yorkins do not know is that Sy has, over a number of years, been making an extra copy of every photograph they have brought in to him to develop and has been using these copies to decorate his flat, where he has several hundred images of them stuck to one wall. In Sy's eyes the Yorkins are the family he never had, his one source of happiness in his humdrum existence. And then, suddenly, his life changes. He is sacked from his job and- even worse for his peace of mind- discovers that Will is cheating on Nina with another woman.The film, superficially, falls within the ""stalker"" genre which was popularised in the late eighties and early nineties by films like ""Fatal Attraction"" and ""Single White Female"". When Sy discovers that his adopted family are less perfect than he had imagined, the emotional world he has constructed for himself is destroyed, and he decides to seek revenge. Unlike many stalker films, however, ""One Hour Photo"" contains a strong satirical element; it can be seen as a satire on suburban life not unlike ""American Beauty"". The Yorkins are an All-American suburban family so eerily perfect they could be taken straight out of a commercial. Although the film was shot in the Los Angeles area, the identikit homes and shopping malls could be set in the suburbs of virtually any American city. This idea of suburban conformity is emphasised by the film's bland and impersonal visual look. We can all think of films (""Girl with a Pearl Earring"" and ""Far from Heaven"" are two recent examples) where virtually every shot looks like a painting. ""One Hour Photo"", with its hard, glossy look and vivid primary colours is a film where virtually every shot looks like a family snapshot. What surprised me most about this picture was not seeing Robin Williams playing a villain, as I had previously seen him in ""Insomnia"" (also made in 2002) and as a fanatical anarchist in ""The Secret Agent"". What surprised me was seeing Robin Williams playing an introvert, as I had always associated him with brash extroverts, such as the motormouth DJ Adrian Cronauer in ""Good Morning Vietnam"", or the inspirational teacher in ""Dead Poets Society"", or the eccentric actor who disguises himself as his own children's nanny in ""Mrs Doubtfire"". Here, however, he is completely different. Sy is the archetypal grey, anonymous ""little man"", a reclusive, working-class, middle-aged bachelor, hardly noticed by the rest of society. His name Sy is not short for Simon but rather Seymour, a pun on ""see more"". Others may overlook him, but his job enables him to see rather more of their lives than they might wish, and it is this which gives him a surprising amount of power. Even though this part is so different from the sort of roles I have come to associate with Williams, it is nevertheless one of his best. Unlike some characters in stalker films, Sy is never allowed to appear simply as a villain. He may be a creepy, dangerous obsessive, hovering on the brink of madness, but we are never allowed to forget that he is human. Williams and writer/director Mark Romanek portray him with sympathy and compassion. He is perhaps one of the casualties of the suburban lifestyle, a man whose obsessions have their roots in loneliness and in alienation from the privileged, seemingly picture-perfect lifestyle of families like the Yorkins. Watching Williams's brilliant portrayal of this alienated loner, the question that came to mind was the one originally posed by the German writer Hans Fallada in 1932, one year before Hitler's rise to power, ""Kleiner Mann, was nun?"" ""Little man, what now?"" 8/10",One Hour Photo
35,namashi_1,An Interesting Watch!,6,15 February 2011,"Mark Romanek's 'One Hour Photo' is an interesting watch, due to it's morbid yet absorbing story.

36,StevePulaski,What clutters a man's wall is worth over a million words,9,30 September 2011,"Even though digital cameras are becoming less and less common, that doesn't mean One Hour Photo has become any less suspenseful or any less impressive. It serves as probably my favorite Robin Williams film, and proof that many comedic actors can take on a dramatic role effectively. The problem is, many don't take the opportunity when it comes.Robin Williams plays Seymour ""Sy"" Parrish, a photo-developer at a corporate giant known as SavMart. Despite Sy's soft-spoken, and generally harmless aging man appearance, he is actually a very depressed man who obsesses over the seemingly perfect family of the Yorkins. The Yorkins are the typical American family; a husband, a wife, and a young boy. Sy has been developing the Yorkin family photos for years, and is assuming the role of ""Uncle Sy"" in the Yorkin family.He does this, of course, because he does not have a family of his own. He lives alone in an apartment with a collage of photos of the Yorkins. All the pictures are plastered to the wall in order and neatness, leaving no gaps or overlaps. He begins to stalk the family after a certain period of time, and from that moment on, Sy isn't so harmless anymore - but actually mentally ill and in dire need of psychological help.Robin Williams jumps right into the role of Sy Parrish. He's creepy, stylish, believable, and scary. From the guy who has done things like Jumanji and other nonsensical films, here comes something you'd never see from a man who played a sailor who loved spinach at one point in his life.But the true talent here is director Mark Romanek, who has worked on many music videos for Nine Inch Nails, R.E.M., and Weezer. Romanek stayed true to the story of the film, revealing more and more informations about Sy and his intentions for the story that he made subtly on purpose. He gives descriptive backstory on why Sy is the way he is at the end, but you may have to do research to piece together everything. While Romanek explained a lot, you still have to come up with your own explanation for the ending. And my view on it is something I dare not give away because I feel it's one of the most mind-boggling, yet, thought-provoking endings in recent memory.During the course of the film, Sy narrates over it, which is nothing but fantastic. His narrations are very relaxed, in a quiet tone for much of the time. And scenes where he explains his customers and what pictures they take is extra information you wouldn't think a film like One Hour Photo would contain. Even graphic insight and personal opinions on cameras and pictures are given here. The film goes outside of its plot boundaries to deliver explicit detail to the audience. I can't thank Romanek enough for giving this an extra dimension to work with.I found this a tiny bit relatable to the film LOOK, which was made about seven years after this. LOOK was directed by Adam Rifkin, a relatively unsung director who shot the entire film with security cameras giving authentic depth and feel to it, while following not-so-innocent people around and connecting them in an anthology-like format. Both this and that show people that we could be being watched and not even know it. That's the power these films bring. And you only get more skeptical every time you watch them.One Hour Photo, even with repeated viewings, is disturbing, and visually interesting. It's creepy to think about Sy's actions, but it's even creepier thinking that back when film was developed constantly, and places like Walgreens and Wal-Mart's ""One Hour Photo"" booths used to be filled with customers, how easy it was to obtain one person's pictures. It's amazing to think just five or six years ago we used to be protective with our pictures, count on them being done in one hour, and then only be shown to a certain number of people. When now, we upload pictures to our computers and then make them so the whole world can see. My, how times have changed.Starring: Robin Williams, Michael Vartan, Connie Nielsen, Dylan Smith, Gary Cole, and Eriq La Salle. Directed by: Mark Romanek.",One Hour Photo

39,MovieAddict2016,You won't be developing your photos again!,10,20 May 2003,"""One Hour Photo"" is exactly what I expected. A very well made, entertaining chiller-thriller that is memorable and notable, but not altogether one of the best thrillers ever. It's one of those that people will be talking about for about a year, but will then vanish, much like the other thrillers about psychopathic psychos.Robin Williams is the psycho in this film, named Sy Parrish, a.k.a. Sy the Photo Guy, as he is called by the son of a family he develops photos for at SavMart, which the director described as a kind of ""Target meets K-Mart."" Though the obvious similarity is Wal-Mart.Sy takes his job at SavMart personally--very personally. He's the one hour photo technician. And, as he narrates to us in the beginning, most people do not realize that photo developers actually look at the pictures you have taken when they develop them. What if one of these onlookers was a complete oddball? Weirdo? Psycho? What if? Let's say the guy makes an extra copy of your photos, just for him to take home and study. Soon that guy starts to think he is actually part of your family. That's when things really start to go haywire. He comes into your life, doing bizarre things. This technique has been used before, but what makes ""One Hour Photo"" so much better is its main character, Sy. He has feelings, emotions, and thoughts. Most slasher-flicks are about little crazy guys that we can't relate to, but you feel for Sy, and, as he does a few things, you start to believe what he is doing--though odd--is kind of good.Robin Williams is getting critical acclaim for giving a ""terrifying performance."" For a moment, I'm going to pretend I know what that means. To me, Williams does not give a terrifying performance. He gives an excellent, scary, but deep performance; as I mentioned above, he's more than some shallow slasher with a knife going after everyone. He has emotions, feelings, thoughts, and we can see them on the surface.I thoroughly enjoyed ""One Hour Photo."" The directing is classic, the acting talent is superb, and I guess I'm probably the only one who thought Williams' character is actually kind of the good guy. He reminds me of Michael Douglas in ""Falling Down"": His bubble has burst, and he's serving up his own justice. What Williams' character, Sy, does at the end of the film, is actually kind of justified.And that's what makes this movie so different from all the other ""psychological thrillers"" out there.4/5 stars -John Ulmer",One Hour Photo

41,KineticSeoul,Sympath for a obsessive psycho,7,25 October 2015,"This is a underrated psychological thriller about a one-hour photo lab worker named Sy that is obsessed with a family, that he develops photos for. Now what really drives this movie, is how it delves into Sy's mindset and what makes him tick. Now Robin Williams did a phenomenal job playing this character. He was believable as a psycho and yet still carried that teddy bear vibe, if that makes sense. Robin Williams played another role where he plays a psychopath during the same year, in the movie ""Insomnia"". But there is more sympathy for his character in this one, because despite it not really delving into his backstory. You as an audience member can sense where the character is coming from. Near the end, the plot seemed to drag slightly but that is only a small gripe. Besides that this is a existential and in-depth movie that deals with loneliness and memories. How some memories we try to hold onto while others we learn from it but want to forget. And how this can have an effect on a person.

42,sddavis63,A Difficult Movie To Rate,6,20 July 2003,"I liked this movie; I'm just not sure how much to be perfectly honest!Overall, I think this is probably the best dramatic performance that I've seen Robin Williams offer. His portrayal of Sy the Photo Guy (obsessed with a family whose pictures he's been developing for years) was probably as ""creepy"" a performance as I've seen, made even more so by the fact that the movie contains no overt violence, although there are several points in the movie when you expect it to. It's very much a psychological thriller, and it works very well.Perhaps Williams' strong performance actually hindered the movie in a way, though. The other characters didn't seem well developed. In particular I thought the performances of Michael Vartan as Will Yorkin and Eriq LaSalle as Det. Van Der Zee were weak and unconvincing. The DVD version I saw had an iteresting commentary version of the movie by Williams and director Mark Romanek. (I didn't watch it all, but certain scenes seemed to cry out for their perspectives - in particular the closing scene which leaves open the question of whether it was a fantasy of what Sy wanted or a look ahead to a reality that finally developed. I vote for the former.)In the end, though, I don't think I'd watch this again, and as I rate movies, if I wouldn't watch it again the highest I give it is a 6. So that's where this one falls. 6/10",One Hour Photo

Beautifully conceived and executed, it's still Williams that makes this movie.  It reminds that, in spite of way too many feel-good comedies, Williams can really act if he wants to, and here he is almost unrecognizable, perfectly capturing the hidden intensity of the protagonist with his quiet demeanor and stifled body language.  There's one moment at the end that, while effective, struck me as a bit too pat, but overall this is a truly brilliant film, well worth seeing.",One Hour Photo

Sy secretly duplicates every one of the Yorkin family photos for himself and in his apartment has an entire wall made up of those photos. To Sy the Yorkin's seem to be the family that he didn't have when he was growing up as a child and now living alone yearns for. There's times when Sy drives to the Yorkin home and sits in his car for hours fantasizing about living with them as their favorite Uncle Sy. One afternoon Sy is called into the SavMat managers Bill Owen's, Gary Cole, office and told that there hundreds of photos that he processed that are not accounted for and because of that he will have to let him go at the end of the week. Hurt over the loss of his job and not having the chance to have contact with the Yorkin's that night looking at all the photos of the Yorkin's that he has Sy sees in a photo of some kind of reunion and a woman in it that looks very familiar to him. The woman turns out to be one of Sy's customers, Erin Daniels, Maya Burson, at the Photo Mat. Checking on Erins photos Sy sees that she's having an affair with Mr. Yorkin, Michael Vartan behind Mrs. Yorkin's Connie Nielsen, back! Overnight Sy changes from a harmless eccentric into an unstable as well as dangerous individual. Sy's actions that are set off by what he found out about Mr. Yorkin's infidelities ends up landing him in the police station where we first saw him at the beginning of the movie. It's also here in the police station that you get the most revealing insight in what Sy is all about. Going into a long and emotional speech about broken families and child abuse at first you think that Sy is mindlessly blabbering. It's alter then it starts to dawn on you that Sy is talking about his own childhood and the suffering and abuse that he went through. You also see that his actions against Mr. Yorkin and Miss. Daniels was to shame them of what they were doing to Mrs. Yorkin and most of all their nine year old son Jake, Dylan Smith. As if it reminded Sy of his own troubled childhood and his attempt to avoid that from happened to Mrs. Yorkin and especially little Jake whom Sy has taken a very strong liking for. As well as Jake looking up to Sy as some kind of friend or big brother.You begin to understand that whatever Sy did was because of a kind of misplaced ethics that he developed in his own growing up and almost forgive, like detective Van Der Zee, Eriq La Salle whom he's being interrogated by, him for what he did. Just before Det. Van Der Zee is about to leave the interrogation room Sy tells him meekly if he can see the photos that he took during the actions that put him in the situation that he's in now.Det. Van Der Zee sympathetically and understandingly hands them over to Sy. As Sy opens the envelope that the photos are in and spreads them over on the table you can see that Sy not only lost his job and his freedom. You begin to realize that the poor and troubled man who did what he did in his convoluted self righteous actions may have lost his mind as well! or did he! Sy cleverly shamed the two adulterers into silence by making them think what he was doing not by what what he actually did! Robin Williams gives a performance in ""One Hour Photo"" of Sy Parrish that would be hard to top by any actor around today.",One Hour Photo

It further serves (along with 'Insomnia (2002' and 'Good Will Hunting (1998)') to prove that Robin Williams was a phenomenal dramatic actor capable of incredible diversity along with an understated charm that actually adds to the sort of suburban creepiness of the couple of frightening characters he took on. What he does here is bring a true, tangible humanity to a terribly disturbed, deeply damaged individual and the slow-burn of the piece expertly winds up the suspense for an unsuspected finale that is as shocking as it is successful, unrelentingly uncomfortable and incredibly engaging (in a 'watch through your fingers' kind of way). Even at its darkest, it never loses sight of its character-based, not mean-spirited, focus. 7/10",One Hour Photo

Antonioni's 'Blow-up' is the masterpiece of the genre. It also belongs to the psychological drama, with the main character reminding the un-forgetable 'Psycho' character, with a striking similarity in re-creating the motivation of a criminal mind under the appearances of a quiet and kind person. The film is very well directed and filmed, but it is first of all a Robin Williams masterpiece of acting. Williams is fabulous in bringing to life the lonely Sy, his dreams of being part of a mid-class urban family, his affection to them which turns into a wrong obsession because it does not fit with the society norms. His acting is so good that the rest of the characters are rather reduced to sketches, and this may be one of the few flaws of this movie. In a year dominated in the by fantasy movies and musical, a real strong drama is refreshing. 'One Hour Photo' is one of my favorite American films of the year.",One Hour Photo

It is a thrilling story as we follow the psychotic character, rather than the characters dealing with him. Sye works in a photo lab and soon becomes obsessed with a family, sending a shiver down your spine as he daydreams about them and eventually brings his feelings to action.However, I did feel the story did not go as far as it could have. We never see Sye break down entirely, we are anticipating something huge, but it never really comes. It's never goes as far as it seems to want have. Robin Williams completely transforms himself in to this role, embodying this sociopathic man looked so easy for him. Despite the fact he had never played a character anything like him previously, he is chilling and not one bit funny.What I really took away from this film was how effective a performance is in creating a likable character. Sye may be a man with no remorse for human privacy or emotion, we feel empathy towards him and his struggles as a result of an effective performance. Thrilling and well acted, One Hour Photo s a worth the watch if you are looking for a good drama or thriller. An employee at a photo lab soon begins an unhealthy obsession with a local family.

Robin Williams' most underrated performance, the comedian's take on the fixated sociopath Sy will make your skin crawl.

Williams is appropriately creepy yet he seems somewhat mannered and unconvincing in the role. Although it is told primarily from his point of view, we never really learn what motivates Williams to behave in the bizarre ways that he does. The plot is silly and preposterous, including the unconvincing notion that a man would cheat on a babe like Nielsen. What's the point of the flashback structure?

The film is effective in every way and the cast is very good and believable. The younger generation might not understand the concept of developing film (and having negatives!) due to everything being digital and instant nowadays.This is a very different type of obsession film, though, as we actually feel sorry for the photo guy, Seymour Parrish. He is actually quite likable and there isn't really an antagonist in the film. Even towards the end when he gets more extreme in his methods one can't help but feel he is only doing it to ultimately set things right, instead of destroying them.

57,zkonedog,Portrait Of A Loner,10,11 March 2017,"Some horror movies (like the Halloween or Saw franchises, for instance) are easy to categorize, and you'll know exactly what you'll get when you push the ""PLAY"" button. Other films (like What Lies Beneath or The Others) start out as thrillers, but end up providing genuine scares in the process. ""One Hour Photo"" falls squarely into the latter category.The plot of this movie focuses on Cy Parrish (Robin Williams), a Photo Center associate at the Sav-Mart (a copyright-friendly Wal-Mart) retail store. Though at first it seems as if Cy is a friendly (albeit slightly strange) guy who puts his all into his rather mundane job, we quickly discover how close to the edge of sanity he really is.The hallmark of this movie is the slow progression of Cy Parrish into complete and utter insanity. At first, Cy just seems like a lonely old man who makes up for it by interacting positively with his customers. However, when a series of events challenges his views on life and frustrates him a bit, he quickly loses his grip on reality and goes to a place much darker than we would ever expect.The first time I saw this film, it truly creeped me out, something that doesn't happen all that often. The acting performance from Robin Williams (perhaps the finest of his entire career) creates a truly terrifying character that a part of us can all relate to.Thus, One Hour Photo is a surprisingly creepy suspense flick that thrives on excellent acting and an intense character study of a loner. Your film-developing experience (or retail in general) will never be the same.",One Hour Photo
58,filipemanuelneto,Williams in the heaviest role I've ever seen him do in movies,7,8 July 2018,"In this film, Robin Williams gave life to Sy, an employee of a big store that works in the department of revelation of photographs. He is apparently competent and a good worker, but the truth is that he hides a fascination for a family he usually attend, the Yorkin's. When he realizes that the unity and joy of that family is in danger, he decides to act and protect the family.The film is not easy to digest. To begin with, the pace is slow, in order to construct the characters and plot in a more appropriate and perceptible way. Then you have the problem of the main character being dysfunctional and hard to like. Initially, he acts like a maniac, with an obsession with that family, to which he seems to wish to belong. We don't know if it's envy, if it's worship, if it's a mania. Even so, there is something rational about how he behaves, as we have seen in the explanations he gives to the police in the end. Another problem, especially for the more commercial audience, is the intellectual touches the film takes on regularly, in monologues or in discreet detail that many people may find boring or expendable. I confess, I enjoyed it.Little can be said about Williams' performance. He is brilliant. I never thought to see this actor, so attached to comedy and humorous characters, to give life to a character so dense and complex, with touches of villain, stalker and avenger punctuated with the sweetness of a lonely, needy and unhappy man. The remaining cast was also fine, but does not stand out and leaves room for Williams to shine as he deserves.Technically, this is a competent, but discreet film. Good cinematography, good light and color, good camera angles, and a discreet, yet capable, soundtrack. I would highlight the monologues, where the film shows some art.",One Hour Photo
59,TheMovieDiorama,One Hour Photo was unsettling to the core.,8,2 March 2018,"Whoa. I mean, I actually felt uncomfortable watching this. I kept fidgeting! The whole premise and the realism of it just affected me greatly. This isn't just a typical psychological thriller where a crazy guy goes crazy and does crazy things. This is an intelligent study of a character who's loneliness and solitude has driven him to stalking a family. A photograph printer who sees into the lives of those that are within these pictures, he is able to imagine himself being in them. He clearly narrates that photographs are always taken on happy occasions, and never on the events that we wish to forget. I found that to be rather poignant. All he ever desired was to be loved or wanted, and yet he just existed. His days are just routines, his life being lived in the clinical colours of beige. So very monotonous. Another great narration was the etymology of the word ""snapshot"" which he said was a hunting term. A guy, with a camera, taking snapshots, of children. Powerful, absolutely compelling. Robin Williams yet again proved he was able to steer away from his typecast comedic roles and endeavour in more psychologically challenging performances. He was outstanding. The supporting cast were fine but Williams owned this whole film. Creepy yet with an undertone of melancholia. You can see how the screenplay manages to convince the audience that his mental state is of depression. We don't hate him, we actually sympathise instead. So many terrifying scenes, not in terms of horror but how realistically possible these scenarios are. Your child talking to a stranger and buying them gifts. A stranger waiting outside your house everyday. These stalker-like behaviour traits is ever so apparent in the current world. That's what makes this film so powerful. Realism. I wish we could've explored Sy ""the photo guy's"" past, I'm sure it would've been fascinating. It may not be a blockbuster thriller, but this little gem is one of Robin Williams' best performances.",One Hour Photo

61,Vartiainen,Robin Williams the Creep,6,12 March 2015,"It's a common saying that all comedy is based on misery. Someone needs to suffer for it to be funny. Thus it should be no surprise that comedians are more than capable of pulling off more dramatic and even outright depressing roles. One might even say they're perfect for them.Enter one Robin Williams, playing the role of Seymour Parrish. Or, as most people know him, Sy the Photo Guy. A deeply lonely man, his life consisting of nothing else than serving his customers at the local photo kiosk and watching television. Things take a turn for the worse when we find out he has developed an obsession for a particular family, called the Yorkins. Sy has lived his lived vigorously through them for years, but now he has finally turned a leaf to full stalkerdom.And thus begins our movie, and it is about as uncomfortable as you can imagine. It's one thing when an obviously creepy and scary man is doing the stalking, but it's quite another when it's someone as sympathetic and lovable as Robin Williams. You know you shouldn't root for him, but it's Robin Williams, and that creates great tension in the film, when usually such a jovial guy just stares at this little boy, offering him toys.Where the film falters slightly is the execution of this great idea. I don't blame the director however because he really wanted the film to be longer, but unfortunately studio meddling got in the way and thus the whole film feels slightly rushed, especially towards the end. I get the sense that the situation was supposed to go on much longer and thus the twist at the end of the second act would have come as a much bigger shock.As a whole One Hour Photo is definitely worth a watch if you're a fan of Robin Williams seeing that it is such an unusual role for him. It's also a decent psychological thriller on its own. It's well-acted, well-shot and the story, while rushed, is not too shabby either.",One Hour Photo

64,freemantle_uk,Solid Psychological Thriller,8,6 December 2008,"In 2002 Robin Williams moved away from comedy acting, going towards more serious roles in One Hour Photo and Insomnia. He should have stayed doing these sorts of roles.One Hour Photo is a story of obsession and loneliness, about a sad man who just craves acceptations. The plot of the film is about Sy (Robin Williams), a man who works in SavMart (a Walmart/KMart type department store) on the photo booth. Sy is a man who takes great pride in his work and likes to get to know his customers. There is one family he takes a particular interest in, the Yorkins. During the film he becomes more obsessed, making his own copies of their photos, looking at them when he can, placing them on the wall of his flat and even said that he is an uncle to Jake, the son of the family. He is obsessed because he sees them as the prefect family and wants to be apart of it. He goes to such extremes to stalk the family, and fantasises being apart it. However, he discovers that the family isn't as prefect as he first thought, and he world falls apart, losing his job and sets out to get revenge.As I said, the main themes of the film are obsession and lonely. Robin Williams and writer/director Mark Romanek show this very effectively, and very real. It was very believable. On the outside Sy seemed like a nice friendly man, who just cared about people. However he really is seeking acceptation and company. Slowly during the film Sy becomes more psycho. Mark Romanek did a very good writing job and his director showed skill. They were good acting performances from Connie Nielsen, Michael Vartan, Gary Cole and Dylan Smith. However, most of my praise has to go to Robin Williams who does give a very chilling performance and should do more serious roles. Some scenes were unconformable to watch, but that was the reaction that the audience is meant to feel. The film does loose it a little in the final act, but I feel Romanek did handle the film well and it works well. I recommend it if you like this type of him.",One Hour Photo
65,dfranzen70,"Matte finish, glossy content",9,12 March 2003,"For most of us, dropping off film to the one-hour photolab isn't a big deal. We drop it off, pick up our little claim ticket, and then go shopping for an hour or so. But for the photo technician, who sees hundreds and hundreds of daily life pictures, each snapshot is a glimpse into another person's world, whether it's a birthday party for an eight-year-old boy or softcore porn for a local entrepreneur. Seymour Parrish (Robin Williams) has been developing photos at the SavMart for many, many years. He's cheerful and friendly to his customers (and he does consider them to be ""his"" customers), and he knows his stuff when it comes to the technical aspects of the job. See, Sy's no mere clerk, although that's how you and I and most other people see him; he's a qualified, experienced technician. So much so that he gets into a brief shouting match with the guy who delivers Agfa developing equipment over a minor discrepancy in the machine.Sy lives alone; he's middleaged and has no friends or close family. He doesn't even have a dog. What he does have, though, is the opportunity to live his life through the pictures his customers have taken, from birthday parties to sex games to vacations to any and all events in people's lives.
There's one family in particular through which Sy lives vicariously the most often: Nina and Will Yorkin, with son Jake (age 8). Sy's been developing the Yorkins' photos sinec before Jake was born, and he's been able to watch the boy grow.This might seem to be a normal obsession, right? At least as normal as obsessions can be, anyway. But Sy, as you may have guessed, is a little different. He has an entire wall in his house devoted to the Yorkin family. Over the past decade or so, whenever he's developed prints for Mrs. Yorkin, Sy has made a copy for himself. As a result, there are thousands and thousands of photos on the wall from the Yorkin family.	When the store manager (Gary Cole) discovers the discrepancy between the number of prints produced and the number that have been actually paid for, he confronts Sy, and the downward spiral begins. Sy's obsession with his surrogate family intensifies as he descends even deeper into madness.But he's not just a creepy loner, although that's a big part of his character makeup. Sy feels a certain kinship with the family - at least with Mrs. Yorkin and Jake - and also feels protective of them. So when he comes across some damaging photos, that descent into madness accelerates rapidly.Is this a good role for Williams? In his recent turn in Insomnia, he was creepy and not at all the hyperkinetic funnyman we all know, and he was very effective at essaying deep emotions. The same holds true here. In fact, I think this is among the best work Williams has ever turned in. He's mesmerizing as Sy, making him not into an unfeeling monster but rather into an obsessive man with a warped sense of values. The other actors are well cast, too, especially Gary Cole as his boss and Connie Nielsen as Nina Yorkin. But it's Williams's show, and while in olden days he might have turned this into a tour-de-force, pull-out-the-stops performance, in One Hour Photo Williams takes a very effective subtle approach. He underplays Sy just enough to let the audience know what he's feeling and what his motivations are without beating them over the head with it.The story moves along very well, and the film is exceptionally photographed (so to speak). The original music by Reinhold Heil and Johnny Klimek is fantastic and - best of all - appropriate to the movie, which is a rare treat.",One Hour Photo
66,meeza,Williams is a sharp shooter!,9,5 September 2002,"Robin Williams stars as Sy the Photo Guy in the powerfully disturbing `One Hour Photo'. Sy is an obsessed photo clerk who obsesses on a family who have developed their pictures with him throughout the years. This is Williams' best work and shot on winning a leading Best Actor Oscar. At least, I do picture him being nominated. Williams portrays Sy as a disturbed loner with a misplaced psychotic behavior. Because Williams executes a masterful job in revealing the melancholic loneliness of Sy, audiences will tend to feel guilty when rooting for our antagonistic protagonist. By being kept in the dark throughout most of the film on Sy's reasons behind his maniac obsession, viewers are unable to predict on how the story develops. However, the information on Sy's `unkodak childhood moments' which explains the method to his madness are eventually revealed. It is Williams' picture perfect performance which makes `One Hour Photo' no flash in the pan.***** Excellent",One Hour Photo
67,jimbo-53-186511,Edgy Thriller exploring the darker side of loneliness,7,9 January 2016,"Sy Parrish (Robin Williams) works in a photo finishing lab at Savmart. He has been an employee there for 11 years and knows many of his regular customers perhaps better than they know themselves. However, Sy becomes really obsessed with one family (The Yorkins) and has kept several of their photos from over the years at his house. Sy's obsession is fairly harmless at first, but his behaviour becomes more erratic after he is sacked from Savmart and after he discovers that Will Yorkin is having an affair with another woman.One Hour Photo is, much like the development of photographs, a rather slow process. It essentially introduces us to Parrish and slowly starts to establish his psychological mind- set. Parrish is a lonely person, a man who longs for family and friends which I feel is something that he believes many people take for granted (which is what part of the film is about). Parrish's job is perhaps the only thing that's keeping him going as I think that getting brief insights into people's lives is a way of taking his mind off his own lonely existence. This becomes evident when Parrish gets sacked which is ultimately what brings his darker side to the surface.Robin Williams is better known for his comedy roles, but it's worth noting that he is also very good in dramatic roles - he plays a creepy character in Christopher Nolan's Insomnia and is excellent in both films. Williams gives an edginess to his character that makes him fascinating to watch even when the pace lags a bit in the first half. This isn't the first time he's taken on a complex character and his versatility as an actor is something that he'll long be remembered for. The supporting cast were all OK, but it's definitely Robin Williams who makes this memorable.I'm sure that many people have come to their own conclusions on what was actually going on in this film; was it all fantasy? Was some of it real and some of it fantasy? I think it's safe to assume that at least some of it must have been in Parrish's head as it's revealed on at least one occasion that what we're seeing isn't actually real.No matter how you look at this film there's no denying that it is an interesting and somewhat disturbing look on the way loneliness can affect individuals in extreme cases. The picture has a simmering slow-burning tension to it and when Parrish catches up with the adulterous couple towards the end it's actually quite a chilling sight. Fans of psychological thrillers or character studies will almost certainly enjoy this film.",One Hour Photo
68,arthur_tafero,Tight Obsession Film - One Hour Photo,6,25 November 2018,"Let's be clear from the beginning; Robin Williams is no Hannibal Lechter. We are merely watching the gradual degrading of a very lonely human being. Even after conviction, he would most likely would have gotten off with a fairly light sentence. His crime was disconnection; disconnection from a family life, life in general, or any meaningful relationships other than a pet gerbil. His job at Walmart (we all know that this is Walmart, please), is to process photos (something made obsolete by I-Phones). He becomes too attached to a family he is not part of and fantasizes inclusion. We do not know what happens to the main character after his crime, but that is not the important aspect of the film. It is the terrible world of loneliness, which can easily drive any of us mad, given the right circumstances. A better-than average treatment of loneliness.",One Hour Photo
69,yusufpiskin,Mark Romanek,7,6 December 2019,"This is possibly one of the best depictions of a sociopath I've ever seen.Romanek's film is an intriguing study of the world of a man who does not really have an identity, but finds gratification of his own life in that of others. What makes this film so unsettling is the way Williams portrays him. He really manages to bring across a sense of realness that is truly amazing to watch. His slow descent into his own fantasy intermixed with the real world problems of his targets is paced and structured beautifully.Romanek is a visual director. He does things in One Hour Photo with colours that are breathtaking to behold. He uses them with strong, bold strokes and thus gives us a film that is as engaging and tense as it is visually stunning.In the end, though, this really is Williams' film. He is the epicentre of evertyhing and pulls off his role with apparent ease. And that's what makes it all the more convincing. This is not a forced performance where an actor acts creepy, this is one where the artist inhabits the role, making you forget who you're really watching. And for an actor like Williams to achieve that, well, that is a performance that deserves the highest praise.Mark Romanek should make more films.",One Hour Photo
70,juneebuggy,Robin Williams is brilliant here,9,24 September 2014,"This was super good, creepy and intense in a quiet sort of way as there are lots of scenes without any dialogue at all. You just watch mild mannered 'Sy' going about his daily routine; working as a film processor at a one hour photo lab at the local mall, eating by himself, watching TV alone with a giant collage behind him, stealing a knife, stalking a young family.Robin Williams is absolutely brilliant here; chilling, fascinating and by the end sympathy inducing. As funny as he is I really enjoy him in the dramatic roles and he nails this. This has been filmed in a way that reminded me of Breaking Bad in that there are lots of scenes without dialogue, you just watch riveted and slack jawed as someone goes about their business. 8/13/14",One Hour Photo
71,noralee,Makes the Every Day Environment Quite Threatening,8,29 November 2005,"My teen age son was suspicious about going to see some weird indie sh*t?"" but the theater was packed for the ""One-Hour Photo"" matinée. However, it was completely inappropriate that one mother brought pre-teen kids -- the R rating is serious -- and I said so loud enough for her to hear unfortunately.I loved the movie from the opening credits. The use of tense, mood-building electronica music (by Reinhold Heil and Johnny Klimek -- though I'm not sure they wrote the bulk of the pieces we hear) and mise en scene showed that writer/director Mark Romanek has watched a lot of Hitchcock and has figured out how to update his lessons.Like Hitchcock, he picks an innocuous, should-be-safe environment -- a suburban K-Mart type store (similar to but way more sterile than the one in The Good Girl. He tells us right away that something disturbing has happened, so the rest of the movie is a flashback, establishing the uneasiness right away and doesn't let it up for a minute.A particular strength is how key plot elements are shown to us not directly but by characters' reactions to them, and that the implied violence is understood in our heads more than it's shown on the screens.We've seen all the actors elsewhere, to lull our comfort level with them, even the bit players are character actors from TV (such as ""E.R."" and ""Alias"").And of course we've seen plenty of Robin Williams. But even as a villain earlier this year in ""Insomnia (U.S.)"" he wasn't as chilling as this. When he chuckles dryly that a customer shouldn't switch to a digital camera ""Because then I'll be out of a job."" you could feel the entire audience mentally meaning to immediately go out to buy one.While the story-telling is mostly straight-forward from that flashback, it reminded me a lot of Memento, from the use of the power of visual images in photographs to the total control the director has over the spooky and suspenseful environment. And us.What's around us every day can be very scary. (originally written 9/2/2002)",One Hour Photo

73,MarieGabrielle,You will not believe....,10,2 June 2006,"how excellent Robin Williams is in this film. I am very interested in anything Mark Romanek now directs. Everyone will be interested in this suspense/thriller; for different reasons.Connie Nielsen and Michael Vartan are also very good as the victimized couple. What is interesting is the understated film technique, acting and theme of this film.I was fortunate to have seen the screening for this movie, as well as the director's comments. Cy Parrish (Williams) is a disaffected photo processor in a local Wal-Mart type store. I loved him in this role, yet the fact that he pulled it off is testament to his ability.Connie Nielsen and her son are the objects of obsession for Cy. While nothing is ever completely explained- that is what Romanek has portrayed so brilliantly. This film is like real life in that- you may encounter people every day- yet do not know/assume what they are thinking.Most of the theme is portrayed visually- a brilliant move on Romanek's part. Whatever has happened to Cy as a child, he clearly wishes for a family now- we see the bleak, sad life as he drives home from work in his Ford Focus; he is a reliable decent worker, but something is awry.Gary Cole is amusing as the anal-retentive store manager (similar in ""Office Space"") he tells Cy (a 50+ year old man) people come in to save 10 cents on a pair of socks- this is retail. The true banality of corporate America exposed.Eriq DeLasalle portrays the detective of the ""Threat Management Unit"" who investigates Cy.This film is suspenseful, well-acted, and not predictable.

74,Jonny_Numb,Robin Williams gives a fully convincing performance,7,19 March 2003,"I saw ""One Hour Photo"" in the theater several months ago, with an audience that seemed to, at first, interpret the role as Robin Williams downplaying his typical brand of comedy.  That tone changed as the film progressed.  As written and directed by Mark Romanek (who's done visually sumptuous music videos for Nine Inch Nails, among others), I was expecting a bit more in terms of visual style--the look of the film seemed glossy and clean, yet flat and dull.  I recently gave the movie another look and better interpreted Romanek's intentions.  Firstly, his portrait of Sy Parrish (Williams), a lonely film developer who uses the prints of one family, the Yorkins, to give his life some semblance of meaning, is very convincing--this is the first of Williams' 'dark' roles that don't convey the actor standing on a pedestal, yelling: ""I'M ROBIN WILLIAMS AND I'M DOING A DARK ROLE!""  Credit the controlled dramatic layering of Williams' performance--restrained, put-upon, and hollow, he disappears in the role and makes it believable.  Romanek's script is conventional save for a few dramatic twists near the end, but his attention to lighting and bright (or drab) colors to create mood is impressive.  Overall, ""One Hour Photo"" is a diverting little item buoyed by Williams' quietly creepy performance.  It's one of the better films of 2002.7/10",One Hour Photo
75,Samiam3,Solid thriller,8,4 July 2010,"I can sympathize for all the photo developers who were put out of business by digital cameras, one of the many thoughts that entered my mind when the film was over. Robin William's plays one such developer in a plot that owes much to Hitchcock, but avoids falling into the trap of ripping him off. That, plus a little emotion, and a great dramatic performance from Williams deliver a fine thriller, occasionally flawed, but I can easily recommend it.The key to the film's effectiveness is of course its subtlety, which is broken in the finale a little bit, but it doesn't harm the drama. Robin Williams can get tiring as a comedian, but his dramatic roles are always solid, (Good Will Hunting, Insomnia, The Night Listener). Here he is deliciously creepy. In the same way that kids are scared of Grandma cause they don't wanna get smooched, there is something very intimidating about the pacifism and extreme pleasantness of Williams' character in this motion picture. Part of it of course has to do, with the fact that it becomes increasingly obvious that he is more than a little bit nuts.I was told that this film was generally panned, which I find a bit hard to believe. Yes, it has its faults, and to some the plot may feel stagy and hard to accept, but I liked the film a lot for what it was. If you want a good thriller, be sure to check out One Hour Photo.",One Hour Photo
76,EdgarST,A reflection on loyalty,8,30 January 2004,"A sad tale about a lonely man obsessed with one family (Robin Williams, more into Popeye's territory than Mrs. Doubtfire's) turns into a sensitive reflection on loyalty, solidarity and togetherness. It falls into the traps of clichéd psychological melodrama whenever it tries to explain the characters' motivations, but during the moments it touches delicate issues of commitment in love relationships, it becomes an intelligent movie. It is the more surprising because it shows a realization about being loyal to a partner done by a young director/scriptwriter, that most ordinary human beings like us realize in old age, sometimes too late. Not surprisingly this story has no blood, sexual molestation scenes or shootings, and it works most of the time.",One Hour Photo

I personally enjoyed the shots of Williams character in his apartment and everything is in its proper place which reflects the sterilized environment he lives in. I'm also thankful that the script doesn't go over the top. It stays believable without going through the cliche hollywood dramatics. Not a great film or anything that is truly special but a pretty well made film and very well acted.,One Hour Photo
78,nycritic,Williams' Best Role Yet,9,3 February 2006,"Terror of the unknown can come under so many disguises, so it's no wonder that the most antiseptic of settings -- a shopping mall reminiscent of WalMart -- spawns the terrifying creature that is Seymour ""Sy"" Parrish.And how many of us haven't gone to these stores to develop our pictures not really paying attention to the man or woman who takes the time to make them come alive (and in one hour, at that)? We live in a society that values privacy, but nevertheless we leave ourselves more naked than we would like to think -- and this is a prime example. Because customer service representatives have been trained to smile at all times and be ""of service"" to their customers, when one of them becomes just a little too intrusive for comfort, no one notices. At first.This is where Sy Parrish comes in. Played by Robin Williams who carries the entire movie on his shoulders, he could be anyone, the friendly guy behind the counter of whom we know nothing. A quiet, non-descript man who has no attachments, he could fade into anonymity at any time and would not be missed. Only one person feels pity for him, Jake Yorkin, who frequents the store with his mother Nina Yorkin, and he even expresses it. ""It seems Sy's a sad man,"" he says, and he's more than right. Sy is a broken man. Just how broken he is we will find out later on.People like Sy Parrish are bombs of anger and self-hatred waiting to explode and cause irreparable damage. Because of the hurt they've experienced they've become sponges absorbing what they deem orderly and perfect, so once they focus their warped interest on someone else, it's as if they were literally absorbing everything about that person. Mark Romanek doesn't waste too much time in exposing Parrish for what he is -- a creepy stalker -- in one masterful shot of Sy's entire living room wall covered in pilfered pictures of the Yorkin's at different times of their lives, no doubt taken every time they would visit his kiosk to get their pictures developed, as he watches -- stares, fixated -- at ""The Simpsons"". But despite this disturbing picture, there's a sense of sympathy, even if it comes later as Sy's psyche comes unraveling and his actions stem from an act of infidelity that someone else's pictures reveal. Will Yorkin isn't exactly the nicest man around and one scene -- a heated argument between he and Nina, early in the film -- establishes his character as a man tired of his family, throwing it all away for a sordid affair. Does this justify Sy's actions? No, but for a man who only wants to do what's right -- even when he himself deludes himself to believing the book he reads (which Nina is also reading) and the lie of the woman's picture whom he calls his mother -- this is all he knows.Mark Romanek has only done one other movie that I can recall, and haven't seen, but his video work is fascinating. Why this man hasn't done more films is beyond me, because as a visual storyteller whose work is reminiscent of Stanley Kubrick. Some of his videos have gone down as the best ever (such as his rendition of the video ""Hurt"" or Madonna's ""Rain""). His mastery in pacing this story is evident. I loved that he creates an escalating sense of suspense and dread with the smallest of elements: a continuous barrage of photo shoots of a little girl playing in the front yard becomes a predator's way of revealing himself. Shown in quick succession, they become quite terrifying. Also, the way Romanek avoids showing a drop of blood and gore -- internalizing Sy's fantasy world, making his anger only vaguely hinted at, but getting him ever so closer to the Yorkin's with his kindness. Except for the final explanation scene, reminiscent of PSYCHO as told by Sy himself, ONE HOUR PHOTO is an almost flawless art-house thriller of a man collapsing into insanity.",One Hour Photo

80,brando647,It'll make you think twice about getting your photos developed...,7,5 November 2007,"Mark Romanek is a successful music video director who is making his first leap to feature film with this intriguing, albeit slow-paced, character study. The film revolves around Seymour 'Sy' Parrish, a one-hour photo clerk harboring a dangerous obsession with the Yorkin family, whose photos he has developed for many years. The last person I would have foreseen being cast in the role of Sy would have been Robin Williams, a man known primarily for his off-the-wall, cartoonish performances. After having watched this movie, I can picture no other actor wearing the blue Sav-Mart vest. The character of Sy is a very restrained, emotionally warped individual and this role shows the range of Williams's skill. Sy is probably one of the more fascinating characters in recent years. Despite his creepy, overbearing, and occasionally threatening behavior, it's hard not to sympathize with him and his obvious struggle for acceptance.Another aspect of this film I really enjoyed was the visual style brought to it by the cinematographer, Jeff Cronenweth. I loved the sterilized feel of the hyper-white aisles in Sav-Mart and the use of green and red filtered lights in some of Sy's scenes. In my opinion, this is probably one of the most aesthetically appealing movies from 2002.My only real complaint with the movie is the slow-pacing. There were points near the middle of the film where it almost felt like came to a complete stop. It didn't help that there were some scenes that seemed completely out-of-place and interrupted the film's flow (i.e. I still don't understand the relevance of Sy's nightmare). Thankfully, what the film lost with its pacing it made up for with its casting. Connie Nielsen, Michael Vartan, and Dylan Smith have great chemistry as the Yorkin family, the object of Sy's attention. Gary Cole (Bill Lumbergh from 'Office Space') has a minor role as the manager of the Sav-Mart and Eriq La Salle (of 'ER') makes an appearance as an agent of the local Threat Management Unit. And, of course, Robin Williams's fantastic performance as the disturbed one-hour photo clerk.This film brings us unseen depth from Robin Williams and a compelling story from a first-time filmmaker. The pro's heavily outweigh the con's in this independent gem and make it worth at least one good viewing.",One Hour Photo

The story sends anyway full of messages for the audience. First there is the love for the family. Second trust nobody. Third children must be protected. Robin Williams played a very good psycho man.

82,stensson,A thriller which is thrilling!,9,26 January 2003,"Mark Romanek is absolutely a new name to be remembered among American directors and script writers. ""One Hour Photo"" is brilliant. Brilliant as a thriller AND as a film. Much is due to Robin Williams who has really started in the serious acting business and has got the tools. This ought to give him an academy award but probably it won't, because this movie doesn't sell enough. Williams however performs a character that you seldom see in American films. There is a complication in this photo guy, which is made very obvious. He is weird in the beginning, but it gets worse. Williams is making all this without overacting. He is quite impressing.The film is really a thriller and a very creepy one. You feel more and more nervous during the 96 minutes. Romanek knows the tricks, but he surprises you many times during the 1,5 hour. In all this, there's also criticism concerning the inhuman way of treating the ""little"" man in a cold society, who cares much much more about money than about people. Especially the little ones.",One Hour Photo
83,SusieSalmonLikeTheFish,The Guy You Never Notice...,8,4 October 2014,"Robin Williams unfortunately killed himself recently. In One-Hour Photo, he plays the role of Seymour, an incredibly nice guy who wants to be part of a family, but who doesn't understand boundaries and ends up terrorizing the Yorkin family and doing more harm than good. He knows Nina Yorkin and her son because he's a photo lab technician at a wholesale Wal-Mart/Costco looking store. He often develops photos of the Yorkin family but secretly keeps doubles, which he uses to build a massive collage on his wall. He has no kids, wife, even a roommate, and it's not only disturbing and creepy, but very sad to watch as Seymour's mental stability degrades to the point where he's taking photographs of his boss' daughter as blackmail and revealing to Nina that her husband cheated on her multiple times with some skanky woman.One-Hour Photo is by no means a horror film, but it certainly makes you think. Could the mailman who always brings your letters, your local pharmacist, the pizza delivery guy, want to be more than just a friendly service? With amazing acting from nearly every actor/actress in this film, it almost seems real.Don't pass up this film, it's a haunting experience and full of brilliant performances!",One Hour Photo
84,KUAlum26,Could be a much smaller movie but...,9,6 May 2006,"...it's still a very effective and chilling film!Taking a different variation on the creepy theme from the previous Insomnia,Robin Williams is Sy Parrish,a lonely,mostly(accent mostly)harmless film developer at a Wal-Mart type store. His job allows him to be a sort of ""fly on the wall"" to people's lives,as they entrust their private photos,which seems to amuse him as well as feed his knowledge and curiosity,about both film AND people. He develops an attachment to a handsome,upper-middle class family named the Yorkins(Michael Vartan,Connie Nielsen and Dylan Smith)and prizes the calm,sanctity and seeming normalcy of their relationship.So when he discovers,through developing a roll of their photos one day that the father is having an affair with a co-worker,this begins to rip away at what Sy has treasured. Given his already tenuous grip on reality and low sense of self-identity,the damage becomes incrementally frightening.Where Insomnia had Williams in an almost unbending menacing role(hope I'm not giving anything away there!),One Hour Photo takes Williams down a much subtler,more sympathetic path. You could feel empathy for him at any point of the movie. You could do it with OR without feeling any dread or any sense of menace about his character.And,of course,you could JUST find him simply creepy,too. The Yorks:Will,the cheating,seemingly above-it-all dad,Nina,the reserved but vulnerable wife and Jake,the kid(who seems to be the only one that shows even a vague suspicion about Sy's quirkiness,though even he seems to be more amused than scared) are prefect counter-balances and surrogates for the audience,as we slowly begin to realize what kind of obsession is at play here.The summary title comes from a theory I've had since I first saw the movie in theaters on first release:I have a funny feeling this movie could've just as easily been translated in a film-short and not been any less effective,but as a full-length feature,this takes on layers that make this film a more viscerally effective piece of fiction. Director and writer Mark Romanek has created a great first-effort film,with characters that are flesh-deep and real and images(particularly of the cold fluorescent-lit department store)that are as haunting as they are mundane. Great film!",One Hour Photo
85,Philby-3,Nice tidy little thriller,7,20 January 2005,"This is a tightly constructed and well executed thriller with an outstanding performance from an actor who has often been in danger of being strangled by his own mannerisms. Lennon and McCartney asked the question: ""All the lonely people  where do they all come from?' Seymour Parrish (Sy) is a case in point; he seems to have come from nowhere, no family no friends, just his job as a photo finisher inside Save Mart, a massive discount store in a suburban shopping mall. He takes his work seriously and he cultivates his customers, particularly the Yorkins, an attractive young couple with a cute eight-year old son called Jake. Sy becomes obsessed by the Yorkins who seem to have the perfect family life he has been denied and he fantasises about becoming part of it. Then he discovers, in the line of duty so to speak, that Will Yorkin is having an affair with a workmate. Sy is sacked (dismissal has been looming for some time) and over the edge he goes.Robin Williams as Sy reminded me a little of Rod Steiger's Mr Joyboy, the mortician in ""The Loved One"", a pedantic minor functionary with a very well developed sense of his own importance. Unusually for Williams it's a very restrained performance, as it must be; Robin Williams would not have remained employed at the Mart for 11 minutes, let alone 11 years. Even when Sy cracks, it is more of an implosion than an explosion.Two less well-known actors with non-American backgrounds, Connie Nielsen and Michael Vartan play Nina and Will Yorkin (no doubt ""your kin""). They put in fine performances, but their low profiles help emphasis their generic character  they are ordinary anonymous suburbanites - they could be you or me. Bigger names would have found this harder to carry off. The other notable performance is from Gary Cole as Bill, Sy's boss, a typical nasty middle manager basically unconcerned about his staff.The ""Save Mart"" (read ""Wal Mart"") is monstrous, impersonal, bathed in fluorescent light and devoted to profit, and not a place anybody of sensitivity would want to work. For that matter the Los Angeles suburbs it was set in are pretty awful  the crew had to go to Brentwood, near San Francisco to find the Yorkins' designer house. Strangely, until things fly apart Sy seems remarkably well adapted to the Mart, as if his very lack of other involvement makes it his home  he is institutionalised. As to what is motivating him, he has a little rant towards the end that suggests he might be taking revenge for some earlier abuse he suffered, but it's not clear why the Yorkins were the target.I guess you could say the film deplores adultery, though for once the punishment is not death. In fact I appreciated the lack of gore. Lonely people aren't all serial killers, after all. As to where they come from, well we don't really care, do we?",One Hour Photo
86,DunnDeeDaGreat,Williams second great performance of the year,8,29 September 2002,One Hour Photo is the second great performance Robin Williams has given this year following Insomina.

87,blott2319-1,"Creepy, but hasn't aged well",7,20 September 2021,"One Hour Photo is a frightening look at the nature of obsession and Robin Williams tapped into something amazing to pull it off. He is superb at portraying this kind of guy who comes across as sweet and friendly, but with an edge that keeps you just a little uncomfortable because you know he's taking things too far. I think the most impressive aspect of the writing in the film and in Robin William's performance is that you find yourself feeling sorry for Seymour. Even before you learn anything about his past, you kind of feel bad that he is so lonely and neglected. I was completely riveted by the entire story, and found myself anxious to see what would happen next. I also loved how they centered his whole obsession around the idea of taking pictures. It was a theme that they utilized a lot in the story, and it always worked for me.Of course, that being said, by its very nature One Hour Photo is a concept that doesn't age all that well. The job he performs is one that no longer exists, and I could see a young person watching the film and having no idea what is going on because people so seldom acquire physical photos nowadays. However, there's probably still a way of telling this same story by connecting it to an instagram or Snapchat account, and the ideas of obsessive stalking are relatable to this day. Where I think One Hour Photo falls a little short is that it sometimes takes things too far. There is a ridiculous dream sequence that has no purpose in the film other than adding some gore. Also, on occasion Seymour takes things to an extreme that feels out of character, particularly when he's not focused on his primary obsession. Still, I was impressed with One Hour Photo and think it is a solid film that does a lot with such a simple plot.",One Hour Photo

89,hnt_dnl,Robin Williams' finest film performance. He should have taken home the Oscar for this.,10,29 June 2019,"As someone who had mixed opinions about Robin Williams' range as an actor (I even found his comedy a bit much to take most of the time), I have to say he's definitely delivered several gem performances throughout his esteemed career and in hindsight, I've seen great acting in certain films from him that I had overlooked. But I can say without hesitation that ONE film I did not overlook when it first came out is this one, ONE HOUR PHOTO (2002). I said it when the film first came out, I said it after that award season, I said it when Mr. Williams passed, and I'll say it to my own dying day, the best performance in 2002 was delivered by ROBIN WILLIAMS in One Hour Photo! And sad state of affairs, he wasn't even nominated for this phenomenal performance. Utter travesty.Sy Parrish is the most realized, subtle, lived in performance that Williams has ever done. I don't see how people can watch Good Morning Vietnam or Dead Poets Society and think that just because he was nominated for those roles they are better than THIS one, where he wasn't nominated. The simple subplot of this creepy piece is that Sy, a nebbish, lonely man who works at the photo section of a Wal-Mart type outlet, becomes obsessed with the Yorkin family Nina (Connie Nielsen), her husband Will (Michael Vartan) and son Jakob (Dylan Smith). Sy stalks the family through their photos, imagining himself to be a part of their ""perfect"" life, which he finds out is far from the truth. As Sy gets closer and closer to Nina and Jakob and learns some unsettling facts about Will, his obsession spirals out of control to an uncomfortable climax that feels eerily realistic. Gary Cole also co-stars as Williams' uncompromising boss. I actually think the best supporting role is given by Eriq LaSalle as a sympathetic cop that is compelled to investigate Sy. But at the end of the day, this is Williams' show all the way.Williams essays so many emotions so well: obsession, loneliness, fear, admiration, friendship, love, envy, hate, shame, empathy. And he does it all with sincerity and not a single moment of overacting. One Hour Photo will probably never make anyone's all-time film lists, but it sure as hell ought to be in the running for all-time film performances, because Robin Williams delivers and then some!",One Hour Photo

He's also, devastatingly lonely and psychotically obsessed with one of his customers: the Yorkin family. Through the photos he develops for them, he learns just about everything about them. But that still isn't enough. He begins stalking them, day in and day out. Just when you think it can't get any worse, Sy stumbles upon a nasty, unfortunate discovery in their photographs. That is, the Yorkin patriarch having an affair with a mysterious woman. Instead of just leaving it alone, Sy considers this his big opportunity to break up the Yorkin household and slide right in.As a dramatic performance, Robin Williams is incredible here. This is one of his all-time best roles. For a man so filled with love and life and known best for providing so much laughter, Williams was able to play a terrifying psychopath just as successfully. Comedy and tragedy, once again, fascinatingly intertwine. Comedic actors can make for some of the best dramatic actors. Mark Romenek's music video aesthetic also contributes to the film's nightmarish quality. From beginning to end, One Hour Photo is absolutely thrilling.",One Hour Photo

The reviews gave Robin Williams heaps of praise for his performance and although it is good it isnt anything to shout about. I was expecting him to be a real creep and that the main man would be scary but this isnt so and this make the film devoid of any suspense what so ever.The film is bright, literally,and the story is ok. The question that is so blindingly obvious is that if the main character is so angry about the husband who is having an affair why couldnt he be so passionate about losing his job?

92,KnightsofNi11,"Good film, but doesn't live up to the expectations the first hour builds within you",7,3 May 2011,"Robin Williams is known for his comedy roles. He is a legendary funny guy, but where he really shines is his serious roles. He proves this in One Hour Photo, a dark and suspenseful thriller about Sy, an employee of a one hour photo lab at a local supermarket, who becomes obsessed with a seemingly idyllic suburban family. Sy's obsession grows to disturbing lengths as he starts to uncover secrets about this family and begins to feel an obligation to protect them, as well as himself. This is a disturbing film that is paced wonderfully and shot with a calm and non-intrusive specialty that captures the films growing suspense excellently.The best thing about this film is its unique pacing and very specific mood that stays consistent throughout the entire film. This film is very brooding and its plot develops very slow, establishing the troubled character of Sy very well and in some of the creepiest and most unexpected ways possible. This film has a lot of tension that builds at a pace much more intelligent than the average thriller. The entire setup is very captivating and the director of this film deserves a lot of kudos for creating a story and a protagonist that are actually engaging and really are thrilling.Sadly where this film falls short is its climax. So much tension is built and the levels of suspense rise to such great heights that it really leads you to expect a lot out of this films climax and conclusion. Unfortunately it doesn't quite get to where you really want it to be, and the way everything pans out is pretty disappointing. The climax and what happens after it isn't bad, and it would have been OK with a film that hadn't set itself up as well. It would have fit right in with the same mediocrity as before. But One Hour Photo builds itself up from the ground so well that when it reaches its peak it is fairly anti-climactic and really leaves you wanting more. All the film needed was a little more thought to go into the conclusion of this film and it would have been truly incredible, but it just lacks that last little push into excellency, thus I can only credit this film as being good.But that doesn't change the fact that Robin Williams is just incredible. This is one of his finest and creepiest performances ever. Sy is such a disturbed man, and Williams makes you believe every last bit of him. The character is extremely well written and darkly constructed to carry the tone of this film. And while Williams is the main focus of the film, the supporting cast does a great job as well. The family Sy stalks is a very believable family, other than a few small bumps along the way. There are various small roles that pop up throughout the film, and none of them seem to drag down the film as they all center around Sy and drive his character's motivations and emotions, which are the heart and soul of this film.One Hour Photo isn't quite a great film, but it is very good. There are some great things about it, but it falls short in its conclusion that it almost ends up being more disappointing than anything else. But it goes to show how fantastic the setup of the film is when I am this disappointed by a conclusion that doesn't deliver what I wanted it to. Robin Williams is the shining pilot of the film who makes it a truly disturbing and captivating experience. I would recommend this film, if only to see Williams incredible performance.",One Hour Photo

94,TOMASBBloodhound,Well acted character study needed more of a payoff.,6,24 April 2005,"Robin Williams proves with this film that his performance in ""Insomnia"" was not a fluke. He can play a creep as well as he can play a funny character. His performance in this film is mesmerizing, while the whole project seems to build up suspense then fizzle around him.Williams plays Sy Parrish, a mild-mannered clerk in charge of developing pictures at a Wal-Mart type store in some unnamed suburbia. Williams comes off as lonely and overbearing as he obsesses over a young couple (the Yorkins) and their son. It seems that he has made a copy for himself of every picture the couple has brought in to the store for development over the years. He has even gone as far as building a collage on one of his apartment walls of these pictures. Sy fantasizes about being a part of their family. In one sequence, he even imagines himself in their home using the toilet and watching a Michigan State football game on the tube. With no living family of his own, Sy has nobody else he feels close to.Things start falling apart for Sy by the end of the first hour. He is fired from the store when a large discrepancy of photographs were found to occur on his shifts. His boss hates him anyway, and that was the excuse he used to get rid of the old man. Sy seems to suspect that the Yorkin family has turned him in, so he decides to get some revenge on the husband. He follows him to a hotel and forces he and his mistress to pose in some pornographic photographs, presumably before slicing them up with a large hunting knife. Sounds interesting enough, but at the end, we find out that nothing really happens to Mr. Yorkin or his mistress. Sy just took pictures of various things in their hotel room; not even of the couple themselves. Okay.....I can't say for sure what the point of this film really is. Other than letting Williams show us how talented he is, there really isn't much to the whole thing. The film is certainly no classic, but it's definitely worth seeing once. Especially if you like Robin Williams. And who really doesn't like the furry little guy????? 6 of 10 stars.The Hound.",One Hour Photo

96,Rogue-32,The wasp on the jello,8,25 August 2002,"One Hour Photo builds its stark intensity from ""the little things"" - brilliant nuances of expression and detail that elevate the film above the level of just another borderline-wacko-going-over-the-edge thriller, and Robin Williams gives an Oscar-worthy performance here, a hypnotic, masterfully etched portrayal of what it feels like - truly FEELS like - to eke out  a traumatized existence of profound loneliness while still craving acceptance and human connection on the only level he can actually deal with it. This level, of course, gets him into trouble, and the most extraordinary thing about Williams' performance is that we UNDERSTAND this tormented character, we understand why he does what he does, and we sympathize.  But Sy gets our sympathy not because Williams tries to get it superficially (from the outside),  but rather because he lets us IN - he lets us FEEL his vulnerability, his rage, his monumental sadness, his overwhelming need, and by the end of the movie we have experienced something truly rare: somebody else's reality. And we have recognized the part of ourselves that, chillingly, relates.",One Hour Photo
97,ajs-10,Williams is great in this psychological thriller...,7,31 May 2011,"I have always admired Robin Williams as a comedian and as a comic actor. He has equally impressed me in a dramatic role, and, to me, this is one of his finest performances of this type. The trouble with someone like Williams is that he has a famous (or infamous if you like) past and you tend to remember him for those things. But if you can see the character beyond the actor then you're most likely going to enjoy the performance a lot more.Seymour Parrish works in the one hour photo processing department of the SavMart store. He has worked there for many years and has seen many customers come and go, but one family, the Yorkin's have been coming back for ten years. They are Nina and Will and their nine year old son Jakob. Unfortunately for them, Seymour, or Sy as he prefers to be called, has become very attached to them through their photos over the years. So much so that he even fantasises about being a member of this perfect family. After an unfortunate event at work and while processing some photos Sy discovers that the Yorkin's are not as perfect as he imagined. As you can probably imagine, this does not go down too well with Sy. I won't say any more so as not to give any spoilers.A really well made film that I found quite atmospheric in places. A great performance from Robin Williams as Seymour Parrish, I really felt he nailed the part! Also worthy of note were; Connie Nielsen as Nina Yorkin, Michael Vartan as Will Yorkin, Dylan Smith as Jakob Yorkin, Erin Daniels as Maya Burson and Gary Cole as Bill Owens.There is a really great commentary all about photographs and what they mean to people that follows through the first two thirds of the film. It is read by Robin Williams as Sy and it really adds character to the film. Although not perfect, I did really enjoy this film and in particular Robin William's performance. Over all, a tight psychological thriller that does what it says on the tin Recommended.My Score: 7.1/10",One Hour Photo
98,AngelHonesty,A Different Side of Robin Williams,7,11 October 2021,"Wow, just wow. Robin Williams is one my favourite comedians but in this film, that man disappeared and turned into a very creepy and psychotic man. Williams gave a stunning performance with his facial expressions and full on creepiness as he mastered his role of the character her was playing. The move was written in a way that gives a person the creeps afterwards. I don't think I will ever look at someone who develops film the same way and I am more then happy that everything is digital these days. The very true thought of how people back in the day used to see all of your personal photos, and what they thought or did with them is just terrifying. The movie was a bit slow, but it gave the viewer a very good look into the life of Seymour and his darker sides, it also allowed the viewer to feel sympathetic but also afraid.

Rarely, can a film of such quality be so disappointing in its' final act. THe ending of this film is completely implausible and stupid!

The movie is never exciting, who's certainly not too good in a so-called ""thriller"", but it is sometimes interesting to watch Williams playing pretty good. Though the movie never really gets into my system it shows both professional stuff and very new thinking inside the category. The thing is mostly that One Hour Photo gets maybe too much psychopath movie in the length, it gets too disgusting watching Williams, it gets too stupid almost actually! Williams plays Sy who works in a photoshop and here he has been working for like 20 years and never done a mistake, he has been following this family for a long time and loves them all...I think it was a mistake by Robin Williams playing in this movie.

101,grahamsj3,Not bad!,7,22 March 2003,"This is, I believe, an underrated film. Robin Williams gives a stellar performance as an unlikely stalker. He works in a photo processing lab and has developed family photos for some families for several years. He lives alone and has a lonely existence. One of the families that he's served all these years seems so happy and close. He finds that he longs to be part of this seemingly idyllic family and he ""adopts"" them in his fantasies. He knows a lot about them, where they've been for vacations, who had piano recitals, etc., simply from their photographs. When he discovers that ""his"" family has a dark secret, he goes bonkers. There's no real action, per se, but a decent amount of suspense towards the end, which contains a bit of a surprise. All in all, this is a very well-scripted and executed film.

102,Darkside-Reviewer,"""The things you're most afraid of have already happened""",7,17 May 2021,One Hour Photo (2002) is an unique and interesting film that tells the story of a photo technician named Sy (Robin Williams) who works at a supermarket one hour photo booth. Sy is a man with two obsessions. The first is for his love of photography which he consistently obsesses over from everything to how film is developed too the more philosophical question of why do people take happy pictures and not sad one's?. Sy's second obsession is with a young family who's photos he has been developing for nearly a decade. Sy begins stalking the young family to extreme lengths which leads to him following the family around and taking pictures of them from the window of his car. Sy's disturbing obsession with this young family soon leads him into taking his fantasies to the next level.One Hour Photo's story is told from the perspective of the stalker who in this film isn't just some out of control psychopath like in a horror movie. Robin Williams character Sy is a deeply disturbed sociopath who's obsession with photography plays into his own fantasies of him being part of a loving family with him playing the role of the husband. Williams character uses his job as a photo technician to steal the personal photographs of a family who he perceives as being the perfect family which leads to him developing an obsession with the family to the point where he fantasies about becoming an integral part of that family. The interesting thing about this character is that from a audience point of view you don't want to hate him for what he's doing but rather hope for the best that he gets the help he needs before his obsession goes too far.Robin Williams gives one of the best performances of his entire career playing such an intense character role so vastly different when compared to his usual more light hearted character roles. It's a shame Robin Williams didn't get the chance to do more movies like this especially when he showed time after time during his long career that his acting talent went far beyond just comedic roles.I highly recommend giving One Hour Photo a chance it's a genuinely thought provoking Thriller that mixes together beautiful camera work with an atmospheric music score to give a unique view inside the mind of a sociopath.,One Hour Photo
103,redkiwi,Not a patch on Insomnia,5,9 December 2002,"Robin Williams' second creepy film in a row, and thank god for that given the utter rubbish he usually makes nowadays!Not as scary as Insomnia, Williams is however far creepier as ""Sy the Photo Guy"" who becomes obsessed with what he sees as the ideal family he never had.It is creepy and does make you jump once or twice, but it is a bit predictable in the way it comes to its conclusion, and the plot did fall away.",One Hour Photo
104,moviesleuth2,Terrifying,10,17 January 2010,"Thrillers are most effective when they slowly build the tension. It may seem slow at first, but by the end the tension is so potent that the viewer will be unable to move. ""One Hour Photo"" is like that, and the lion's share of the credit has to go to Robin Williams.Sy Parrish (Robin Williams) is an extremely lonely man who works at the One Hour Photo store at the SavMart (think WalMart). His only moments of happiness are when the Yorkins come to drop off and pick up their photos. But Sy's affections aren't just because he's a nice guy, he is obsessed with them, imagining himself as ""Uncle Sy"". But Sy is also very unstable, and any crack could make him dangerous.Robin Williams made a career in comedy, but he also has a great talent for drama. This is easily his best performance. Sy is anti-social to the extreme, but we can also see a bit of ourselves in him. All of our insecurities feelings of loneliness are present and exaggerated in him. The other cast members are great, but this film belongs to Williams.Mark Romanek is a a terrific director. The film is perfectly paced, and the tension builds to a nearly unbearable level. But the film's look, helped by cinematographer Jeff Cronenweth, is one of this film's most unique and helpful attributes. The too-bright lights of the store, the use of pastels (especially white) and the overly positive jargon of big corporations, is all reminiscent of Wal-Mart. Yet, there is also a tone of darkness underneath it all, and that helps increase the tension. Lighting in a thriller hasn't been used this well in any other movie I have seen next to the ""The Descent."" This is a bold and terrifying thriller. Don't miss it!",One Hour Photo
105,joachimokeefe,"Gripping, thought-provoking, excellent music & cinematography",9,4 June 2006,"A superb film - a credit to all concerned, especially the art director who must have gone mad setting up all those snapshots! What I enjoyed most about One Hour Photo is the structure and pacing; people looking for cheap thrills won't get it at all, but it builds on the blatant creepiness of Sy until you really worry about what he's capable of; and the resolution is perfectly sequenced. Eriq LaSalle perfectly underplays the dispassionate 'family man' cop. There's plenty of suggested back story too - it seems as though Sy was a victim of ""the worst thing you're afraid of ... has already happened"", ie kiddy porn in his abusive childhood in this context, which explains his utter social incompetence, yearning for 'proper family' and drive to act out the abuse once again. Why not a 10? Because er, perversely, I think Robin Williams, although impressive beyond what you might expect, is ever so slightly over the top. Many who found it boring have commented that they didn't believe the basic plot premise of a nosey photo guy for a second, and Williams is so very creepy from the start that you do wonder, in an otherwise 'realistic' film, why nobody comments on what an absolute creep he is, though the manager seems glad to be rid of him... I kept thinking of Mrs. Doubtfire (who also wouldn't have fooled a myopic crack addict for a minute). But the unusual premise, superb direction (the escape sequence in the hotel, for example) and excellent soundtrack had me hooked; this film is clearly a cut above as a thriller while addressing a serious issue intelligently. Hitchcock, eat your heart out.",One Hour Photo
106,movieguy1021,One Hour Photo: 7/10,7,19 September 2003,"One Hour Photo has what many critics hailed as Robin Williams's greatest acting job. I don't think so. Although he's excellent in his role as Sy the Photo Guy, he still excels at doing comedy in movies like Mrs. Doubtfire. Photo is music video director Mark Romanek's first movie was writer-director, and it's very distinctive that it is. It's hard to explain, it just looks like a rookie operation.Williams plays Sy, a photo clerk at SavMart, a Target type place. He loves his job very much, and his customers more so. His favorite family includes the Yorkins, Nina (Connie Nielsen), Will (Michael Vartan) and Jake (Dylan Smith), who Sy thinks is a perfect family. He makes extra copies of their photos for himself, and in his apartment he has a wall filled with their cherished memories. However, Nina and Will are on shaky ground, presumably about money, but we can't really tell. When Sy realizes this, and something else that's quite obvious, he doesn't like how he's been misled. And he gets angry. This shy soul doesn't like that, and he's going to do something about it.The greatest pro and the greatest con both involve Romanek's script. Romanek has created almost a fantasy world, where it seems that everything is going right. The story is so original it seems like it could have been a true story. The character of Sy rings so true, it shows that we all know a Sy somewhere in our lives, yet we don't take the time to notice him. However, the supporting characters were some of the most uninteresting I have seen in a movie this year. I didn't care about the Yorkin family one bit. Not only that, but there was no development of the Yorkins. What did Will do that we were supposed to know? We didn't know. What about anything about Nina or Jake? I have no idea. I wanted less of the Yorkins and more of Sy.A reason it is apparent that Romanek is a auteur director is that he expects all scenes that could be thrilling to be thrilling. They could have been made tense but instead Romanek just assumes that we think it is. Although that scene, bound to be famous soon, in the hotel room at the end was, the rest of the movie wasn't. Williams showed yet again how versatile he is; he can star in comedy or drama with perfect ease. He was superb. However, all of the Yorkin family came off dull and flat. Gary Cole, as the one-note boss, was way better than people should be in supporting roles like that. Overall, One Hour Photo is an interesting drama with great lead acting.My rating: 7/10Rated R for sexual content and language.",One Hour Photo
107,WriterDave,Interesting...but far from great...,7,26 September 2002,"One Hour Photo is not exactly an enjoyable movie, but a very well made and interesting one where Robin Williams plays a lonely and quite possibly psychotic photo guy working at a place surreally like WalMart who seems a bit too infatuated with a young family whose photos he has been developing for years. Honestly, though Williams ultimately gives this ""psycho"" a very sympathetic human side, he was far more effective and entertaining as the murdering pulp novelist in ""Insomnia"" (which still holds the place of best movie of 2002 thus far). In the end, despite taut direction from Mark Romanek (who directs with a style that is equal bits David Fincher and David Lynch), the film collapses under its own depressive weight. In the end we realize that the events that unfold in the film are probably happening on a daily basis in America, which isn't a very entertaining nor original notion, but still a powerful one. Oh, yeah, and everybody's favorite actor Gary Cole is in it as Robin Williams' mean boss. Stat! Get Mr. Brady (aka the Devil Sheriff) an Oscar! His best performance since playing Lundberg in ""Office Space."" Of random note....did anyone else notice how the kid playing Jake Yorkin never really smiled (he half smiled at best and it seemed strained, or he just ""smirked""--did that have some hidden meaning or was it just the way the kid smiled?) and how is eyes also seemed puffy? Also, if that was the same Connie Neilsen from Gladiator as Mrs. Yorkin (and it was!), then she is quite possibly the most underrated and miss-used actress of her generation.",One Hour Photo

What i enjoyed about it was mostly the restrained style and the fact that for once movie-makers understand that gore is unnecessary to create suspense. What felt less appealing was the fact that in the end the story is not that dramatic and it felt a little too ""light"".In the end ""One Hour Photo"" is Robin Williams show. I have always said that he is at his best when the role is as serious as possible. Here his performance reminded me much of his performance in ""Insomnia"". Both are sensitive and solid portrayals of psychotic people that have much going on beneath a calm surface.

110,dfa120374,Very Enjoyable Psychological Thriller,6,28 March 2015,"I think the first time that I saw One Hour Photo I couldn't have been paying too much attention to it because I actually thought it was a very slow paced mediocre film. However, after now watching it for the first time since it's release and actually paying attention, it is definitely much better than I initially thought. The film is pretty slow-paced - that view's not changed - but when you pay attention, and understand & listen to what is happening, it doesn't feel all that slow as you become more drawn into the story, which is well written.The story isn't full of implausible moments, it doesn't have that ""Hollywood touch"" about it, and isn't full of the usual stalker film cliché's. I also enjoyed how it got you thinking if some of the later scenes were for real or if they were just in Sy's head. I mean the first main fantasy scene wasn't obvious until it's end, so maybe other scenarios weren't real either. It never confused you but it got you thinking which was good.The cast all do a great job with their roles, but Williams was the main standout with his performance of Sy. You know that Sy is obviously completely in the wrong with what he's doing but you still feel sorry for him and this is where Williams plays the part SO well. He doesn't make Sy seem like some clichéd sick twisted psycho...he portrays Sy as just a very nice but a sad, lonely individual whose only friend in life is his pet hamster. No matter what happens during the film, you just cannot feel any hate towards Sy.I sometimes don't notice the way scenes are filmed in movies at times, but the use of the colours to depict the mood for different scenarios was done well I thought. The main instance here being the difference between Sy's own personal world i.e. in his home, compared to that of the Yorkin's. It's not done for the sake of it nor to be ""artsy"", but done with reason which adds to the overall feel of the film.This isn't an amazing film, but it is enjoyable.",One Hour Photo

112,bsinc,Sy the good guy,7,28 July 2007,"Perhaps most people got this movie as a cynical psychological thriller (which it most certainly is), but I was surprised that practically no one mentioned or recognized its truly important constant positiveness and overall moral message. This picture-like movie to me was a reminder of how good a life I live, of how good I really have it going. It reminded me that I fail to understand and appreciate this on a daily basis, that I fail to recognize that the warmness of my home, the love from people around me and the overall good that is the result of all this, is something I neglect and pay very little attention to. As did the picture-perfect family in this movie. And here is where the true meaning of ""One hour photo"" lies: it's not a story about a psychotic, neglected and non-social little man that took comfort in pretending to live a different life. It's about showing how even the ones that have it perfect don't always know how much they should be thankful for it...and in some cases even mess it up completely. The more I think about it, the more I actually see Sy as a sort of personified, flesh & bone guarding angel. The soft and white tones of his hair, clothes, car and apartment further help make my point. When at the end of the movie he actually got into the position where he could have committed a serious crime, he instead punished the swindling couple by giving them both the lesson of their lives and left without a sense of guilt whatsoever. And as crazy as it sounds(even to me at this very moment), he was almost entitled to do what he did. Throughout the whole movie he was the voice of everybody that is less fortunate, of people that suffer through their lives and hope and dream of living a better one (hence his immense obsession with the Yorkins), and he was more than justified to act: he merely gave a reminder, nothing more and nothing less... ...It's a reminder that I'll need to be taught over and over again: to respect, love and appreciate what I've got. Kissing the ground I walk on should become my daily habit!:)7/10 The movie I can compare this one the most is definitely ""Hard Candy"", especially for the very real and possible story, as well as for the immensely brilliant aesthetics and detailed perfection of them both.Highly recommended, especially on a very laid-back night.",One Hour Photo
113,DavidSim240183,A fascinating exploration of loneliness to insanity,10,3 June 2006,"One Hour Photo is one of the creepiest psycho-thrillers of the last few years, because of the way it gets under our skin, and almost turns us into a voyeur, like the central character Sy Parrish (Robin Williams in one of his finest film roles to date).Sy works at SavMart as a photo lab technician. We've all met these people behind a counter where we drop off film rolls to be developed. But I'd never really given much thought to the development process. One Hour Photo actually shows us how rolls of film are slowly developed into the finished product of a collection of photographs.If there is one thing that's important to Sy it's his customers. They entrust their rolls to him, he guards them copiously, and painstakingly crafts them as if they were works of art. But of all Sy's customers, the Yorkins are the most important to him. Will Yorkin, his wife Nina and their son Jake. Sy has been developing their pictures for seven years now. And he takes an active interest in their welfare.The Yorkin family life depicted in the photos is happy and eventful. They have a beautiful house. They are loving. They share everything. They are the happiest, most content family who ever lived. In print. But in reality, it is a very different story. Nina is a good parent to Jake, but Will is much more neglectful. And he doesn't show much affection to Nina either. Because he's secretly having an affair.Sy is blissfully unaware of this. Because he prefers to live within the fantasy of his photos. Not only does he develop the Yorkins pictures, he makes extra copies for himself. And places them on a wall in his drab apartment as a bizarre sort of shrine to the Yorkin family. They represent everything missing from Sy's life. Although Sy is a seemingly unassuming man who blends in with the crowd, he is a painfully lonely soul. He has no family. No friends. No joy. No life.Robin Williams gives a powerhouse performance. playing a man forced to live with his own loneliness. Mark Romanek's direction is top notch and lends the film a sharp edge. The cinematography is gorgeous and surrealistic. There doesn't seem to be a frame wasted. And most importantly, the hues of browns and gold almost make some of the shots actually seem like real captured images. It only strengthens the point being put across how life can be captured in a photograph, and be made to seem more happier than it really is.Romanek keeps things moving at a brisk pace, giving us ample time to explore Sy's psyche while also furthering the plot. Williams gives a deeply affecting as well as moving performance of a tortured man and his inner demons. Scenes of Sy at SavMart drenched in dazzlingly white colours and neatly stacked shelves is Sy's personal heaven, and are then juxtaposed with Sy's miserable existence at home with drab colours and a lifeless atmosphere of melancholy that hangs over him.I think with One Hour Photo Robin Williams has finally put to rest some of his disastrous film choices of late. Here he is completely believable as not an evil man, just a lonely one pushed to the breaking point. His turns of character are always plausible because of the steady direction. From Sy's amusing dedication to his job, to being irked when people fail to show him the respect he feels he deserves, his anger at being fired, to his raging psychosis at the climax.There is always an ominous feeling hanging over the film. We know something bad is going to happen. But Romanek restrains himself and never goes for the easy payoff. He allows events to unfold at a leisurely pace, with a remaining residue of uncertainty forever lingering. Watch the scene when Sy has just been let go. As he's walking through the aisles, you'll notice the numbers that mark them off. And Sy's face gradually becoming more unrestrained with the passing of each number. His volatile nature is always there just waiting to explode. It is this type of subtlety that allows OHP to shrug off the others of its kind.Connie Nielson gives a good performance as Nina. She's most effective in her scenes with Sy and his clumsy attempts to make conversation with her. But this is Williams' show all the way. He is in command of every scene. Showing remarkable restraint for the most part, and when he does indulge his wild side, it is entirely in character. The funny man has changed his act.Romanek also provides some deeply creepy images. The shrine sticks firmly in my mind. As well as Sy's supremely eerie dream. Sy's voyeuristic impulses taking over when he discovers the Yorkin family life is less than perfect. There is so much communicated in a tiny shrug. Or a significant pause. Romanek knows the value of subtlety. And that is the mark of a good director. I look forward to his next film.I was a little surprised by the ending, because it wasn't quite what I was expecting. But it was still satisfying in an odd way. There are people who may feel disappointed. But I felt OHP ended with a bang.There are lots of nice touches throughout. Especially Sy's narration that easily allows us to sympathise with him and his situation. One Hour Photo is a marvellous story of one man's mental meltdown, and the tragedy is, how it largely goes unnoticed by the everyday world.",One Hour Photo
114,MovieCriticOnline,"Interesting, but too slow",1,10 June 2020,"Interesting concept. But overall way too slow. I also think Williams over did it in this film. Actors instincts is usually not to trust that less is more, so they over do everything. When they are supposed to show their guilt they force looking guilty. When they are supposed to not look and behave creepy they actually force themselves to look and behave creepy. Williams manifests this big problem most actors suffer from. Over doing things. It's likely the director's fault for over acting by actors because they have a tendency not to see it themselves.Making him LESS creepy would have been much more convincing and more powerful because he would come across more scary.So that was one thing that bothered me. But the story just moved too slow. They could have added more events instead of focusing on one and then taking over an hour to get to it.Maybe in the hands of a different director it may have worked, but I think the problem was the script. It was a lackluster unfortunately.There were several problems with it but one of the biggest was when Williams confronts the husband in the hotel room and he didn't even recognize him after meeting him several times. Also, detectives do NOT confront suspects without backup by regular cops and they certainly don't split up and do it on their own. That's basic police 101.The casting was also weak. The climax was just a let down after a LONG build up.In the end they could have done so much more with the character and what he could have done with the family leading up to the ending.",One Hour Photo
115,domino1003,Would you trust this guy with your photos?,9,4 June 2005,"Watching Robin Williams' performance in One Hour Photo make you want to switch to a digital camera instead.Williams plays Sy Parrish, a photo operator at Sav-Mart (Think Wal Mart). He's the guy that develops the photos for the customers. Sure, he has a cheery smile and a sunny disposition, but his life is empty. He has no friends, no lovers, no real existence other than his job. He eats alone, sleeps alone, lives alone.He also has a temper that is downright scary (He goes off on a photo repair guy in the middle of the busy store). The one bright spot in his life is the Yorkin family. To him, Will (Michael Vartan), Nina (Connie Nielsen)and Jake (Dylan Smith) ARE the perfect family. He so much wants to be part of the ""happy family"" that he has YEARS of their photos covering his wall in his apartment! He fantasizes about being their ""Uncle Sy,"" part of their ""happy family.' As any person will tell you, the picture doesn't tell the whole story. Sy soon finds out that his ""perfect family"" is far from it. He gets into constant trouble with his boss (Gary Cole). With his life crashing down, Sy goes over the edge. The most disturbing scene involves what occurs between Sy and Will. It becomes a rape scene in the most disturbing way. It can leave you wanting to wash off the slime that's coating you.Mark Romanek, director of such videos as Johnny Cash's ""Hurt,"" and various Madonna videos such as ""Rain,"" makes his big screen debut here. He does a wonderful job and brings out the best performances out of his actors. Cool, haunting music by Reinhold Heil and Johnny Klimek.",One Hour Photo

Having heard Robin Williams was in it I was originally put off, until I saw his performance in Insomnia and was extremely impressed (although considering that film, it wasn't difficult). Seeing the trailers and hearing some comments about it I became very interested, and when I finally saw the movie I wasn't disappointed, far from it. Williams shows he is a superb and extremely capable actor, it's almost a shame this has been overlooked by his comic genius. As for his performance, he is fantastic. Throughout the film he keeps the feeling of something unsettling, and slowly, bit by bit, the film reveals to you little aspects of his character and lifestyle to take you deeper into his mind. He plays this character extremely well, and there's not, as one of my friends said, any `Robin Williams' moments. That little recognition of his stage persona. The film is superbly shot, and builds the brooding menace feeling. With a few nice twists in the tale too, it proves to be a superb thriller. Cinematography and soundtrack are emphasized heavily in the movie and help to put you on edge throughout. Even the smallest, seemingly innocent scenes prove to be the ones that keep the audience quiet. A brilliant movie with a superb performance by Williams. See it.",One Hour Photo

118,TwistedContent,A Dark Character Study with a Gripping Performance,8,10 January 2021,"There was always a lot of intrigue to find out what's been called one of Robin Williams's toughest roles and most horror-like movies, and, even after 18 years, it is a performance & story that holds up the chills and morals. ""One Hour Photo"" is an unexpectedly dark character study with considerable depth, anchored magnificently by Williams showing skilled hand at handling an atypical and eerie material, and a clean, almost uncomfortably sterile style direction by Mark Romanek.Seymour Parrish, a mentally troubled photo developer has been obsessing over a middle-class American family whose paper memories he's been making, and the obsession is slowly getting more blind and disturbing than anyone would expect... Romanek, with this being his first (major) full feature, has done a great job. A story like this could've easily been a dime novel worthy obsession thriller to sink among better examples, but subtlety won over Romanek, and the approach he's taking commits to the movie's heavy atmosphere and bizarre nature. The utterly unpolluted, clean visual style reminded be of Kubrick, but more so of Yorgos Lanthimos films, like ""The Killing of a Sacred Deer"" and ""Dogtooth"". Around the middle and beginning of the third act, Romanek seems to lose the momentum in the story a bit, but the ending makes up for it. It's quite the flawed thriller, but undoubtedly a great drama.
Sy ""The Photo Guy"" is whimsical before he's stone-cold, often disturbingly fearless, always craving of connection, filtering his life through the idea and philosophy of photography, hiding his hurts and thoughts deep down. Seymour Parrish could very well be Williams's finest performance, for the effort in probing such psyche really grips and impresses. Rest of the cast, from Connie Nielsen to Michael Vartan and Eriq La Salle, offer solid supporting performances. I'd also like to compliment Reinhold Heil & Johnny Klimek, the composers of the original score, which surprised me in its effectivity and how much it didn't remind me of the early 2000's.
SPOILER AHEAD: ""One Hour Photo"" actually reminded me of ""Joker"" quite a bit - both movies are about mentally troubled persons, both of whom are basically villains and also the by-a-margin dominant main characters of their respective movies, both of whom eventually commit heinous acts propelled by their traumatized minds, both of whom even end up in very similar places. What's my point? There isn't one, just a handful of similarities I noticed.""One Hour Photo"" is a flawed movie with a substantial and pitch-black character study, carried by an all-loved actor famous for much different roles, and carried so masterfully.

119,dead47548,A remarkable character study.,8,8 January 2008,"A remarkably character study. The film is a slow building piece that leads up to the final, surprising revelation. The entire time I was wondering what drove this man to become such a loner, living vicariously through this seemingly perfect family and when we finally get the answer, I just sat in numbed silence. It's very rare when a film can shock me to the core and just leave me laying there, numb, throughout the entire experience. I was being knowingly haunted yet I couldn't do anything to stop what was happening. Everything about the film, from Williams' shockingly horrifying (in a good way) performance to the frightening, atmospheric score. I really can't begin to describe how much this film shook the core of me. I can rarely think of a time where I was so disturbed by something so subtle. They could have made the ending some outrageously huge deal, but they made it subtle and realistic. In the end you can't do anything but pity this character and sympathize for him. He's just a man who was wrecked and deeply disturbed in his childhood which led him to such an alienated life. Being this photo processor allowed him to live vicariously through what he believed to be the perfect family. But of course no family is perfect and when he loses this perfect image of them, it throws him over the edge in one of the most disturbing displays of a deranged mind I've ever seen.",One Hour Photo
120,paulcreeden,Lacks mature humanity.,7,23 September 2002,"Robin Williams delivers a brilliant performance. The art direction is wonderful. The cinematography is also great. But, the film presents the same shallow stereotypes about human behavior as a cheapo Halloween film might do with more camp and gore. Single poor middle aged men are scary or bad or crazy or gay or all of the above. Married pretty young people have everything and feelings too. All single poor middle aged men must therefore hate or envy all young pretty married people. These cultural stereotypes are the basis of the film's credibility. They are derived from the sensational press stories of psycho serial killers and such. The film would make excellent propaganda against anyone who deviates from the nuclear family norm. The hotel scene seems especially confused to me. One minute, the Robin Williams character seems like Dirty Harry, and then he seems like Hannibal Lechter. The thematic core seems adolescent. It lacks mature humanity. I prefer the Halloween films' version of the subject matter.",One Hour Photo
121,Mort-31,Predictable,5,18 September 2002,"Usually thrillers like this are shown on minor television stations at about ten p.m. and never find their way to the movies (only, of course, if someone like Robin Williams stars). I was invited to a preview of this film, and I got negatively surprised. The plot of One Hour Photo is based on the idea that it is quite spooky to think of somebody who knows a lot about you because he regularly develops your photographs. A nice idea this is but that's where it ends: The story is predictable and the dialogues are tense and artificial, therefore no suspense arises, and after a couple of minutes it's perfectly clear how things are going to develop. Robin Williams is brilliant, though, but he has no competitors. The family he persecutes is boring and pale, and Connie Nielsen stands out concerning soap-opera-acting.An obvious means of style is the use of pale colours only to present the main character's every-day surroundings. I am not quite sure whether to regard this as a good trick or just as a lack of creativity. In the end, the main character explains his whole life (and the whole film) to the audience, and it doesn't take him more than two minutes. I guess this is how this movie came into existence: the writers presented their idea to the producers, it didn't take them longer than ten sentences, the producers were convinced, and everything else was just a matter of time and money.",One Hour Photo

Photography is absolutey first class, helping Williams deliver one of his finest performances.Acting by the rest of the cast is supporting, and no particular role stands out, but certainly there are no downright poor performances.The script is rather poor, but it has its moments, above all when Sy follows Mrs Yorkin's vehicle in expectation to see how she reacts to the photo showing her husband's affair with Maya Burson, and some terrifically frightening scenes, such as when, in his mind's eye, he wanders about the Yorkins' house, to the point of using their toilet to excrete.Frankly, after all the buildup and the steadily sinister development of Sy's character, I was expecting a more psychologically substantiated ending, with the violence that tends to accompany such incidents. Instead, Sy loses his job, steals a lethal weapon, breaks the law in various ways... and he does all that just to show Mrs Yorkin that her husband deceives her and her son?Nah, I don't buy it and I feel cheated by such a dishonest ending.You do not get to learn whether Sy gets the appropriate prison sentence, all you see is Sy in the final still, with the Yorkins and their son.

124,gary-444,A Neat Compact Thriller,7,13 February 2011,"A well crafted, low budget, psychological thriller that succeeds because of its' restraint. Robin Williams stars as a middle aged single loner, Si Parrish, who works in the photo development lab at a supermarket. He lives his life dealing with memento's of events which others wish to remember, their photographs. But is it to replace that which he wishes to forget? Williams is terrific. Quiet, creepy, with just a hint of menace and violence he insidiously works his way into the lives of a perfect couple, possibly replacing his own less than perfect past life, past and present, with theirs.Connie Neilsen and Michael Vartan play as husband and wife , Nina and Will Yorkin whose superficially attractive life collapses as Parrish finds the cracks. The sets are limited, mainly a shopping mall, the Yorkin's home, and a Hotel giving the feel of a stage play, and it is the script, the words, the dialogue which dominate.The final act is strong, yet still Director and writer Mark Romanek pulls his punches. The sexual dimension which could easily have been gratuitously exploited, isn't. The violence which simmers under the surface is not fully realised. The only truly unexplored element is why he surrenders everything in a Pyhrric victory. Photographic, framing and picture allusions abound both obvious, and subtle, and the one and a half hour running time is perfect for the story. Romaneks previous work has been mainly with Music Video which will have helped with the stylised presentation and limited sets, but to his credit he also shows an ability to tell an extended narrative outside of his milieu.Although this falls short on the sex and violence and edge of your seat tension stakes, it is nonetheless satisfying in its own right and can be looked back on with pride by all involved.",One Hour Photo

126,smakawhat,Chilling...,7,4 October 2002,"Watching this film made me feel one sensation only.  Cold.  very VERY cold. But that's not necessarily a bad thing.  Seymour Parrish (Robing Williams) is a photo lab tech at a local discount super store.  Sy, as he likes to be called, is an aged loner much ostracized from the world.  In his lonelyness he ends up fantasizing about belonging to a real family that frequents the store to drop off film.  However, Sy's fantasy ends up into an obsession as he takes duplicate pictures for safe keeping and imagines himself as actually being part of the family.Sy's attempts are awkward to watch, his first glimpse at conversation is painful to observe.  He's like that school kid hurt and alone on the playground who people might talk to, but nobody wants to play with. Eventually Sy's obsession ends up getting blurred between reality and fantasy, and gets ready to explode as he gets fired from his job.The makers of this film have also created a great look to Sy's world. Sy's store front is awash in a see of white, bland looking and hopefuly empty. Here he works and not so much as an employee but more of a fixture to an already lifeless world.  Much of the cinematography is awash in a see of white, from an interogation room that Sy is held in flashbacks, and the store front of never ending white shelves.  The film also has a grainy touch creating an even more sterile feel into Sy's world.Nevertheless, the film is a little slow plodding, and it's a gradual but sure climactic climb.  Also one note of interest is that Sy's boss is played by Gary Cole, who was also the annoying boss in ""Office Space"".  However playing similar roles but completely different characters as Gary does here (and very well might I add), I couldn't help but wait for Gary to come up to Sy and say ""Hey Sy what's happening?  About those TPS reports...""  Just a minor distraction :)But looks aside and minor flipant technicalities (same boss 2 different films), Williams pulls off an amazing performance in what is sure to the best role of his career.  The hard thing is believing that this guy use to be an A+ class comic clown.  Seems Robin can inherit the world of serial killers like nobodys business.  The dilemma is whether to give him a best actor nomination for either this film or Insomnia.See this film for Robin Williams performance alone.Rating 7.5 out of 10",One Hour Photo
127,bix171,Instantly Forgettable,5,12 March 2003,"Unchallenging material and execution renders this Robin Williams thriller instantly forgettable. Everything is anticipated, even the twists; there are absolutely no shocks and though the film does get a bit creepy toward the end, it does so in a voyeuristic fashion designed only to sate the viewer's appetite for torture and manipulation. Williams stars as a mild-mannered film developer at a discount retailer who develops an unhealthy fixation on a family he perceives to be perfect; when he discovers they're not, his balance is thrown and he feels he must remedy the situation. This is the kind of character you always fear manic comedian Robin Williams will play: a character self-consciously trying not to be manic comedian Robin Williams, an introspective, lonely drone who shelters his thoughts of violence behind his placid but friendly demeanor; naturally, in such a self-serving performance, he's dismal, never allowing himself to get lost in the role and revealing precious few nooks or crannies to peek into. (Which is a shame because he was much more interesting doing serious work in his prior role in `Insomnia'; at least there he was able to bring some humanity to his goading blackmailer/killer.) Mark Romanek, the writer/director, has created an cold, sterile world for Williams to roam around in that by itself is a dead giveaway but he himself brings no fresh ideas to his project and prefers to deal with everything in a precise, technical manner; everything has to be timed perfectly (including the score by the great Reinhold Heil and Johnny Klimak from `Run Lola Run') with no margin for error. Unfortunately, it makes for a very uninteresting movie. There is, however, some fine tracking work from cinematographer Jeff Cronenweth, who also did `K-19: The Widowmaker' and `Fight Club'.",One Hour Photo

There was so much opportunity to learn how the character got to this place in his life, but we never find out.  We have no idea what caused him to have the relationship with this particular customer out of all of his customers.

He played very few that showed another side of his acting, parts that were dark and disturbed. Perhaps watching a movie like this shows how sad and alone Robin Williams may/or may not have been, as he went deep with this performance, and channeled a deeply sad and disturbing individual in this film. Most acting comes from at least 'some' part of the actor as they are the one acting the part. Just saying on that note. But this was truly a great film, one of Williams' best performances for the sheer fact that he never showed this side of his acting very often, but also just because it was a terrific performance. There is a twist at the end of the film, not so much a twist to the story, but a twist to the character and how we view him after learning the twist. Everything about this movie rides on the twist at the end. Any lesser film and the twist would have been contrived/forced, and basically phony. But the subtle way the twist unfolds with the great writing and the top level of acting William's gives in the moment, the twist unfolds very naturally. The scene also where Williams is running down the hotel parking structure, brilliant, just brilliant. Williams will be very missed.",One Hour Photo
132,jeremy3,Just a Little Too Vague,7,5 April 2007,"The acting by Robin Williams was brilliant. He was really engaging as someone who was lonely and no one in his life. His only life was being the photo developer at Save-Mart (obviously, Walmart). He secretly keeps photos of his customers (and knows a lot about them). He loves his job, and is likable with his customers. Trouble begins when he starts delving into the personal life of a family that he has film developed for. Williams' character can't stand the fact that the father is having an affair. He decides to take action in his own hands. After all, in his delusional mind, he is the ""uncle"" of the family. The movie really shows how lonely and abandoned someone can be that they have to dream up a family life of their own. Gary Cole plays the boss. He is not likable and a bit too bossy. At one point, Cole tries to bar Williams' from returning to the store after being fired. There was no cause for this at this point. Williams had done nothing yet. The thing I didn't like about this film was that it never really committed to anything. Was he a total nut case without redemption? Did he have an agenda that was important? What was the point of the film? What is the film trying to say? I think the creators of the film were intentionally trying to blur this, because in today's World life is complicated and motives unclear. The best illustration of this blurring is when William's took pictures of his bosses's son and sent them to him. Williams may have been threatening his family, or just simply trying to show that he has power and control. That may have been the point of the movie. It is never entirely clear - people's motives in today's World. The movie could have done a better job though giving the audience a direction to work with.",One Hour Photo
133,The_Core,The Sav-Mart is scary...,7,4 March 2004,"There is something ugly and sterile, dehumanizing about places like the ""Sav-mart"" in this film (of which there are more and more every day back here in real life).  I don't like stores like those.  I'd rather go live on the streets than work in a place like that -- at least the streets still have color, a sense of humanity and I wouldn't have to turn up in a well lighted tomb every morning working with zombies for as little money as they can get away with paying.  Against this cold, icy paragon of nightmarish 00's consumerism it's no surprise that Robin William's character would snap. Anybody could snap -- it's an apt place to go crazy in, as devoid of genuine human contact as a crypt.  And when Williams meets Nielsen's character in a modern day mall (another such place) eating lunch and she says ""Just fueling up to do more shopping..."" (shudder).That's what this film is really about, in my opinion -- the alienation and cheap emptiness of today's consumer culture, and the lie of the ""perfect"" suburban family (whose beautiful looking house is made of cheap synthetic materials, no deeper or more real than the photos taken there).  It's been done before, and certainly better than this... the script is mediocre to average, but the lighting, cinematography and acting are all well above average.  A must-see for anyone who's felt lonely, alienated and set adrift in today's culture that turns you into a buying machine from cradle to grave... then it turns your relatives into coffin and funeral service consumers, and puts a supermall-bought set of clothes on your dead body and a copyrighted and trademarked quip on your headstone.

Although this character, played brilliantly by Robin Williams (didn't know he had it in him) is seriously disturbed, you can't help but feel sorry for him: he tries very hard but nobody likes him. That's about the first time ever I felt sorry for the bad guy. In terms of plot, nothing really spectacular ever happens. There's no gore, no murders and hardly any violence. Instead, we get a finely constructed tale of how Sy (the bad guy) slowly but steadily slips away into desperation until he finally snaps.

135,nesfilmreviews,This film succeeds solely through the phenomenal performance by Mr. Williams.,8,8 May 2013,"""One Hour Photo"" as a film has its share of flaws, but none of them are related to Robin Williams' powerful and haunting performance. It's his fullest and yet most restrained effort to date. ""One Hour Photo"" creates an effective portrait of a lonely, deranged man becoming increasingly frantic. He crosses the line from being harmless and pathetic, to being dangerous when he can no longer differentiate between fantasy and reality. There comes a time when it is no longer enough for him to fantasize, when the role of distant observer, no longer satisfies. Robin plays the role of a man named Sy, who runs the photo-developing lab at the local Savmart. Sy has nothing in his life but his job and his fantasies -- no friends, no family, no wife, and no girlfriend. He looks depressed in tranquility and suicidal when he smiles. Sy's obsessive nature has a good side. The prints he develops in his lab really do look gorgeous, and takes pride in his work. On the other hand, he is also developing a fixation on a family, the Yorkins, and has an entire wall of his apartment plastered with photos of them dating back 10 years. And now -- though the movie never specifies an emotional trigger -- he is losing his grip of reality, falling further into his delusional thoughts. Much of ''One Hour Photo'' informs the audience through visual stylization. The cinematography is as finely detailed as Sy himself. Williams inhabits a carefully selected color scheme, a world of harsh whites and washed-out blues, illuminated by the glare of fluorescent bulbs. Director Mark Romanek pays more attention to this style than giving depth to his characters and plotting, exploring Sy's psychosis but never really delving into the reasons behind it. A disturbing yet compelling film that pulls you in solely on the merit of Williams' fantastic performance.",One Hour Photo
136,JoshtheGiant,Could Have Been Great,5,23 November 2005,"One Hour Photo is a film filled with good ideas but none of them go anywhere unless they go backwards which they do sometimes.

And than after he finds out that the father is having an affair and that the family is not perfect he breaks down. This could have been an extremely disturbing and deeply scary film but instead it ends up simply being a little disturbing and a little scary, and thats simply because of the idea, you get scared about the same amount just thinking about it. It falls apart mostly because of the script which while trying to make Sy look like more than just a monster ends up giving him almost no development at all, in other words you don't care about him. There's very good direction here though, he has some great symbolism the colors especially.

Nowadays in the digital age, people rarely need to go to a photo developer. They still exist of course, but are not as popular as they used to be. Even at this time however, digital was starting to take its place. Bad news for Sy, as the slightest suggestion that the family he often develops photos for might go digital frightens him...This movie completely blew me away. Robin Williams plays a character so nerve-wreckingly creepy, strange and pitiful that he gets under your skin so much he becomes real. That's some of my favorite kind of characters, where they feel so real that they almost start existing. I have no words for how layered his performance was. It would be so easy to just make a character straight-up creepy only, but the fact that you want to root for him even though you're worried at the same time he'll finally snap speaks volumes for how much he embraces this character. Sy is not a bad person, but he's still dangerous. He's compassionate, but also oddly disconnective. The Yorkin family (well, Nina and Jakob at least) like him, but they are not aware of just how much Sy really loves them, not only as customers, but like they were his own family members. The only times they get an idea of that is when he ""jokily"" refers to himself as Uncle Sy. When he does start to get a little too close to them, director/writer of this movie conveys it so subtly how they are pleased to see him, but at the same time they know something isn't quite right. Will Yorkin notices something odd about him right away, but doesn't think too much of him outside of just a ""stranger"". This is the core of the movie, the struggle of Sy trying to get something he can't have. It's almost immediately obvious he's close to them, but it's not enough. He wants to be more than just a nice familiar face. We as the audience know how easily he can break loose of any logical thought and restraint, which he does throughout but it happens so slowly and methodically we feel constant shivers long before the movie is over.Gary Cole is also good and kinda funny as his frustrated boss Bill Owens. All of the performances range from good to excellent, but if it wasn't for Williams the movie wouldn't have as much meaning as it does. It makes you think about how dangerous loneliness can be, how important support from family or friends is. We don't want to end up like Sy, but we strongly pity people who turn out that way.",One Hour Photo
138,g-hbe,A revelation,8,27 October 2006,"We saw this film for the first time on TV the other night. Neither of us has ever been much of a Robin Williams fan, considering his style OTT and unsubtle. But his performance as the quiet Sy Parrish blew us both away. Sy is a lonely man who lives a lonely life in a bare, bland apartment. To give himself the comfort he needs, he 'adopts' (without their knowledge) a local family who always take their photos to his lab in the mall. He makes copies of their photos and displays his favourites on his wall, and he even claims to be related to them. When he finds out (via photos) that the husband is cheating on his wife, he gets mad... This is a very sad film almost all the way through, somewhat reminiscent of Shyamalan's style. Some moments are so touching and acted so well (again amazed at Williams' underplaying) that it can bring a lump to the throat. The end is beautifully done. One to savour.",One Hour Photo

Rejection and deceit he cannot take.  How he reacts to it, is very thought provoking.

Mrs Doubtfire is probably my favourite film of Robin's but I also decided to watch One Hour Photo. This is a film I'd never heard of but the premise sounded intriguing. I was also keen to see how well Robin could do a 'serious' role as I'd only ever really seen him in comedies. I was very impressed with this film. The plot is extremely creepy and thought provoking. The acting is very good and Robin plays Sy the Photo Guy to perfection. He is a very strange character, his actions are disturbing and it's intriguing to find out more and more about this character as the film goes on. The film overall is pretty intense and does well to avoid some movie clichés. I felt it was a very unique film in its own kind of way.I was quite surprised to see it rated at only 6,8. I think more people need to become aware of this great little film. I will give it an 8.5/10.R.I.P Robin Williams",One Hour Photo

144,ryan_kuhn,"""All I did was take pictures...""",7,13 February 2005,"Each time you go to a discount department store, you see familiar faces. There's the door greeter, the woman behind the snack bar, the usual cash register attendants. The movie One Hour Photo uses this idea, namely the man who processes the film at a one-hour photo lab in a Wal-Mart-esquire retail store in Suburbia, USA. Robin Williams in one of those roles that continues to tell audiences he's more than Mork in his acting ability plays Sy the Photo Guy, a harmless looking man who is painfully lonely and decides to adopt a family, whether they know it or not. The Yorkin family is a loving family of 3, with father Will (Michael Vartan) and Nina (Connie Neilsen), with son Jake (Dylan Smith). Every time pictures are taken, they take them to Sy to have them developed. Sy, while processing the film, makes copies for himself to take home and ""live"" life with the Yorkins. This movie is powerful in showing that creepy, despicable characters are sometimes the ones we have the most sympathy for. Robin Williams conveys a feeling pity when he is doing the most wrong. One Hour Photo, written and directed by Mark Romanek, makes a familiar guy in all of our lives and makes him a parent's worst nightmare. He's just a lonely guy trying to make it in this world, but he makes bad choices. The only character who sees the bad side of Sy early is his boss, Bill, played by Gary Cole of Lundbergh fame in Office Space--sadly, no TPS reports here in One Hour Photo, a much more serious and somber tone to the film. All of the actors are top notch, but it's Williams who performs the best, making a horrible human being a sympathetic creep by the end of the film.",One Hour Photo

146,jrfranklin01,A Bit Too Creepy For A Second Viewing,7,31 January 2005,"It's hard to imagine Robin Williams as a psychopath, until you see him play one and realize that Robin can pretty much play any part he puts his mind to. ""One Hour Photo"" is the story of Sy Parrish (Williams) who works as a photo developer at a local superstore. His isolated life and abusive past stimulate him into forming relationships with his customers through the photos he develops. One family in particular he favors, having developed their photos for several years and seeing all of their memorable moments (wedding, birth of their son, etc.). Williams begins a fantasy relationship with this family and imagines himself as ""Uncle Sy"". The desperate desire for Sy to have a normal social environment with love and support is terrifically supported and conveyed through his deluded idea of what each photo represents. When Sy realizes that the perfect family in the photos is anything but, he goes further awry.Williams does such a good job and director Mark Romanek superbly unveils how ordinary-looking, everyday people in our lives could be otherwise and an unsuspecting threat. The film had such a creepy feel afterwards and felt possible too true, that I don't think I could muster a second viewing. They should make college psych. majors watch this one! 7/10",One Hour Photo
147,TheFilmGuy1,A Thrilling And Disturbing Character Piece,8,14 November 2014,"Having watched Nightcrawler recently, I was in the mood to see some more great performances from actors playing disturbing characters. One Hour Photo is exactly that kind of film.Robin Williams plays Sy, a man who works at the one hour photo place at a Walmart type store. The issue is that he starts to become obsessed with one family in particular that gets their photos developed by him, and it becomes clear very early on that Sy just isn't right in the head. Williams plays this character unbelievably well. He comes across as totally crazy, but in a down to earth way. The best part is, he is completely sympathetic too. Although you know he's messed up, you can't help but feel the pain this guy has deep down. Williams perfectly executes this and it's great to see. In particular, a scene at the very end that I won't spoil has Sy indirectly telling another character about something that happened in his past, and it's pretty heartbreaking to see. I think the performance also has another amount of depth to it due to the recent suicide of Williams, and it makes you wonder if that sadness that he shows in his character is something that he channeled from his own feelings. Very sad, but an amazing performance.The movie is quite well shot. The scenes in the store are very white and feel sterile in a way, and the scenes in the family home have a warm tone to it. There's lot of great uses of color throughout, like the red developing room being used to emphasize a characters emotional state. There's also a good dream sequence that is disturbing and memorable. Overall, it's a pretty wonderful film to watch.I really like how this movie plays out. It slowly builds up the characters until about the one hour mark, where things start to really kick off and the build up pays off. It's an intense and disturbing character study of a film, and I absolutely love that. Robin Williams performance is under rated, and NEEDS to be seen.",One Hour Photo

There are scenes in this movie that you can tell are just time fillers, as there is no real plot or structure to this movie.I HATED the family. The parents were terrible actors, and were just pathetic. I did not care at all about any of them. The AGFA guy and Sy's boss were much better actors than the parents, even if the AGFA guy was a bit cliché. And the guy who plays Yoshi was such a drip, boring and nothing to him. You'd think if Yoshi and Sy had worked there for years together they would be chatting away all day about this and that, but all we see is Sy spending most of his time alone! Ridiculous.And the 'SavMart' they worked in is one of the phoniest, fake malls I've ever seen. It looks almost Ikea like. The whole place seemed spotless and dirt free also. In fact, throughout the whole movie everything is picture perfect, excuse the pun.And we have the cop from ER, who seems like he is on tranquilizers the whole time, like hes stoned through out the movie. His character is completely wooden also.Yet another good idea for a film wasted and ruined. i didn't hate One hour Photo, there just could of been so much more to it, but it remains on one level throughout.",One Hour Photo

152,mweston,3.5 stars (out of 4),8,15 October 2002,"For people who like their thrillers to be thrilling, this film makes a crucial mistake in the very beginning, by telling us more or less what the outcome is. Specifically, we see Seymour (""Sy"") Parrish (Robin Williams) in an amazingly sterile, bright white police facility having his picture taken and being questioned by a detective (Eriq La Salle from ""ER""). The film is told in flashback.Sy has been working for years as the photo developer at SavMart, which looks a lot like WalMart only brighter and less colorful, like the sterile police station seen earlier. We find out early that he has an interest in the Yorkin family - Nina (Connie Nielson from ""Gladiator""), Will, and son Jakob - even memorizing their home address and giving Jakob a disposable camera for his birthday. Creepier still, he gets an extra set of their photos for himself.I won't go into any more detail on the story, to save the remaining surprises.The performance by Robin Williams is remarkable. Despite being very well known and familiar to the audience, he disappears into this character, leaving no trace of the stand-up comedian or ""Mrs. Doubtfire."" He is bland and deliberate, but with turmoil sensed beneath the surface. This performance should be remembered at Oscar nomination time.But what really made me enjoy the film as much as I did was a feeling that it just *worked.* I don't really know how to describe this feeling I sometimes get (not often enough), except that the films that evoke it often win awards for screen writing. The story is simply told well.But is it a thriller? It has been sold as one, and there are certainly many tense moments, but I think it is really more of a character study of someone you would normally hardly notice. When someone suddenly erupts in violence, going ""postal,"" the neighbors are very often heard to say ""he was a quiet man."" Sy Parrish was a quiet man.Seen on 10/10/2002.",One Hour Photo

Williams plays much darker here than in ""Insomnia"" and the overarching sense of loneliness is reinforced by the Kubrick-homage cinematography. However, ya can't go home humming the lighting, as they say...and the story itself just falls flat. The ending is a shambles. I'm not exactly sure if it's supposed to be real or a product of the main character's imagination. Either way...the character isn't..you'll pardon the expression..developed, in any significant manner. The ""chase"" scene is a waste of time that would have been better spent inserting some meaningful dialogue into the interview scene with Eriq La Salle. (Tom Noonan in ""Manhunter""--another psycho in a Fotomat---managed to flesh out his character much better with significantly less screen time---it's all about the writing and direction, kids.)Anyway...Kubrick aficianados will find much to admire, and it's worth watching if only to see Robin Williams as he's likely to look at the age of 83...but this ain't no ""Psycho"", this ain't no ""Silence"", this ain't no foolin' around.....(apologies to David Byrne)............",One Hour Photo

I generally don't like when they try to make an unsympathetic character sympathetic and in this case they were unsuccessful. Basically I couldn't wait for him to get caught. Even that aside, I thought the film was very flawed. As it unfolds, the scenes with the police are totally unbelievable. But the ""Threat Management Unit"" is on the case in full force. With very little evidence of any wrong doing, they have seemingly a whole force staking out a house, store, and a hotel. With this very flimsy evidence they get a search warrant when I know any judge would laugh at the evidence. The only bright spot was Robin Williams portrayal of this psycho.

161,Snake-666,"Good, but not great.",7,12 October 2003,"Robin Williams is Sy Parish, a seemingly pleasant man who works at the photograph processing department of a large discount store. His favourite customers are Nina Yorkin (Connie Nielsen) and her son Jake (Dylan Smith). Sy, however, has a rather unhealthy obsession with Nina and her family and often dreams of being a larger part of their world.One Hour Photo' is an entertaining movie from director Mark Romanek. The movie avoids most common clichés and portrays Williams' character as a nice yet socially maladjusted man, rather than a sick stalker. Make no mistake, Sy Parish is a deeply disturbed man but the viewer is made to sympathise with him rather than detest him. Through some good storytelling we are able to see the development of Williams' unhealthy obsession and are made to question whether he is actually doing much wrong? It is certainly wrong to stalk someone the way he does, but at the end of the day he means little harm. Mark Romanek's screenplay does a rather good job of portraying this despite featuring quite a few moments of unnecessary and forced dialogue. One Hour Photo' is paced rather well, though it does seem to drag in places and more too quickly in others. However, the story that develops is an interesting one and stirring enough to keep the viewer watching.Williams is very credible in his role as the disturbed Sy Parish and performs up to a high-standard that we have come to expect from him. One Hour Photo' allows us to see the vastness of Robin's talent and his ability to fit into almost any role. While perhaps not his best role he is certainly the star of the show and delivers his lines surprisingly convincingly. I was wary of Robin Williams playing this sort of role but now realise that he is just as adept playing this type of character as any other. Connie Nielsen is also good as the unsuspecting Nina, though fails to really impress. Flaws with the script prevent Connie's character from really standing out. There is a noticeable lack of character-development in certain places and while most things are wrapped up at the end, some questions are left unanswered. The ending is very powerful and saves the few scenes before it which seemed to drag. When the reason and extent of Sy's sickness is unveiled the viewer is left with a compassionate and strangely hollow feeling.Apart from the final ten minutes there are few memorable moments (except a short but effective nightmare sequence), yet the movie is still rather fulfilling. Some proficient direction compensate for the intermittent flaws in the screenplay rather well. One Hour Photo' is an appealing and compelling thriller with few scares but a real psychological and unsettling edge. Williams, though not on top-form, really helps to make this movie and it was a role he desperately needed after a few years in obscurity. My only real complaints with 'One Hour Photo' are the lack of character development in places, the sporadic moments of unnecessary dialogue and infrequent screenplay flaws. I recommend this movie for at least one watch. My rating for One Hour Photo'  7/10.",One Hour Photo
162,MrVibrating,An interesting take on the psycho,9,6 April 2006,"We know how a psycho behaves. He stuffs his dead mother, he keeps his victims prisoners for months in a well, he has a creepy dungeon full of perverted stuff, he has an invisible friend, he invents deadly cat-and-mouse games. This is the psycho Hollywood has taught us about for decades. But the real psycho, the one you'd never notice, the one which can pass for normal for years and years, where is he in movies? In One Hour Photo.This movie and Insomnia is what i call ""Robin Williams goes serious"". Instead of his cheery, lovable characters he usually portrays, he comes off as a cool, slightly abnormal person living on the edge of insanity. While Kevin Spacey has the charisma of a person who'd kill his mother without a blink of an eye, Robin Williams is the guy who everybody thinks is normal and who in every way is, until he snaps. He was a lonely writer in Insomnia; here he's a lonely photo-lab worker.Williams is great in his role. Jack Nicholsson was suggested for the movie, and while I love Jack, I can't help feeling he would have ruined the tension and the subtle parts of Sy's character. Robin Williams is perfect in the role and you forget it's him ever so often.The movie is technically brilliant, it stays away from the clichés, the script is tight and the supporting cast is pretty good(except the child actor, but that's to be expected).

Since it's a dramatic thriller, sinister behavior's a sure thing.Otherwise, it unfolds in an unanticipated manner. Therefore, it's difficult to draw correlatives without spoiling.It's written and directed by Mark Romanek; as of yet, the first in his two-feature career.People seem to forget Robin Williams's range as an acting talent. Aside from the voice of Genie in Aladdin, amongst a slew of other impressive roles, his achievements are featured prominently in Good Will Hunting and What Dreams May Come.Williams stars as Seymour ""Sy"" Parrish, a photo booth attendant with a suspicious proclivity.Connie Nielsen turns in an excellent performance as Nina Yorkin, a frequent customer of the one-hour photo development lab. Nielsen's had a long career in the film-biz. Unfortunately at first glance, her cinematic history seems unremarkable.Her most noteworthy role is that of Lucilla, Commodus's sister in Gladiator. Now that you think about it, she's very good in that, yes yes?See how easily the notion's misplaced?Nielsen's acting chops really shine through here, but her performance is easily forgettable in the midst of a confusing tale, daunting subject material and a powerhouse protagonist.Sy's workplace is a satirical version of Wal-Mart located in a suburban mall, but the setting's of minimal concern.(Side Note: If you can find me a Wal-Mart that's half as clean, organized or well-staffed as this Savmart, I'dwell, I'd never believe you.)The only necessary contextual reference is the plot's unfolding upon the cusp of digital photography. Sy's occupational necessity teeters on irrelevance.Two types of people will enjoy this: Film buffs and psychology scholars. As a piece of commercial art, it's impossible to ignore the story's merit.This is a tight, well-crafted ninety-five minute film. Priority lies with painting a clear picture of a character coping with a contemporary existential crisis, not with polishing the narrative veneer.But, should you see it? Why not?Spoiler sensitive types. stop reading here!In particular the photo development process is masterfully shot and edited beautifully. The sequence shimmers as a fountain plume of knowledge, and a cornucopia of succulent eye candy.Speaking of ocular capability, the disturbing nightmare remains a mystery to me. The scene's certainly there for a reason; I simply can't discern the purpose at present. But Romanek's first feature's such a sterile and meticulous craft I don't need to revisit the material. Its purposeful placement is fairly supposed.Nuance glimmers in the details, after all.And that's what I like about this movie; the hint of fairy dust twinkling amidst shadowy corners.During an early moment, Nina comforts her son Jake (played by Dylan Smith) who voices concerns about Sy's loneliness. Lying on his bed, Nina reassures him by suggesting they close their eyes and generate good thoughts on the photo attendant's behalf.While the scene unfolds, Jake fiddles with an 'expanding sphere' toy, and it resonates thematically with the larger narrative. As the boy expands and contracts the plastic mechanical star, their positive energy's injected into the metaphysical ether. Isolated from Sy's physical presence, the pair still generates good will for him, when nobody else is.The cosmic microcosm resonates with the later discussion of Deepak Chopra and the expanding/contracting of the universe.Another revelatory moment takes place when Sy walks the boy home from soccer practice.In this scene, Nina's son illustrates a mature level of even-handedness most adults can't muster. Without a trace of judgment, Jake accepts Sy's gesture of friendship. The boy welcomes the attendant's company, just like he would a schoolmate.Subjective audience members are acutely aware of the danger in Jake's actions because of potential instability in Sy's mental faculties. Stepping back and ignoring that bias reveals no immorality or cause for suspicion in the protagonist's actions.Up until Sy offers the action figure, he hasn't technically committed a moral transgression. But Jake's refusal of the gift draws a line in the existential sand. The boy's commitment to honesty is of significantly less concern than the alternative implications.In a way, this choice to decline is the catalyst allowing Sy's ultimate redemption. The film culminates in a realm of moral obscurity; perhaps otherwise, that wouldn't be the case.The action figure represents an unspoken power shift. Instead of being two human beings standing on equal footing; Sy tempts the boy with an unachievable material gain. You might call it 'forbidden fruit.' No matter what the phrasing, a 'gift' still represents a tangible exchange.And I'd also argue it shows Sy at his weakest. Luckily for him, Jake makes the correct decision on both their behalves.A refined detail is the framed mirror with the reminder to 'Check Your Smile' in the Savmart locker room.Even the means of self-evaluation, the lens through which Sy can inspect himself, lies in the shadow cast by the judgmental puppeteers of higher-tiered society.I never do this but I'm going to cheat by parroting the conclusion from another review.Because, hey, it's succinct.Elaine Cassel concludes, ""Movies could play a more productive role in explaining psychopathology if the sources of twisted behavior were explained realistically and compassionately, as they are here. One Hour Photo is a rewarding study of abnormal behavior and one that psychology students should appreciate, if not enjoy. It leaves us wondering, and caring, now that we know what's wrong with Sy, what will happen to Sy.""Brief, yeah? Hope it helps!",One Hour Photo
170,crypticcrytic,A Kodak moment?,7,17 September 2002,"We're accustomed to Robin Williams playing quirky characters.  From the unscripted Mork to the unconventional Patch Adams, we have learned to cut him slack in taking roles to enhance his range rather than his image.  This one is a stark contrast to his recent touring performances and HBO special, and perhaps it's his way of achieving balance. We see a remarkable portrayal of Seymour (Sy) Parrish, a lonely guy getting his life experiences by vicarious means and an extra copy of selected prints. Without a life of his own, Sy lives through his fantasies triggered by the photos he expertly develops. His narrative on the lives of select regular patrons of his shop is a classic of middle American profiling. And his strict attention to detail brings him close to blows with a repair technician whose reality is closer to pedestrian standards.
Beige is Sy's theme from his clothes and car to most of his apartment. The contrast between his sallow life and his target fantasy family is vivid. His only friends seem to be imaginary as Sy move from fantasy to reality in dream sequences that get more bizarre as the story moves forward.Gary Cole portrays the typical discount store manager (Bill Owens) who's waiting to pounce on any oversight as he peers out from the perch overlooking his domain. His management style, as evidenced by Sy's discharge, is a textbook example of bad management, but more the rule rather than the exception for a mall manager.     When Sy begins to use his camera as a weapon (with an interesting explanation of the derivation of the word ""snapshot"") he really goes for revenge. And by the time he's through, you have a very strong argument for digital photography and marital fidelity.In the absence of a dark room - since these high-tech developers do it in broad daylight - we have a very dark film. Not one that will give you nightmares, but you'll never again leave your real address with the clerk at your one-hour photo.",One Hour Photo

175,zensixties,Best Actor Oscar Robin Williams/Best Screenplay Mark Romanek,9,24 September 2002,"One Hour Photo is excellent from beginning to end.  Of course there is much more to it then meets the eye.  Robin's latest non-comedic role is that of Sy the Camera Guy, a friendless, familyless man who's childhood demons are about to catch up with him.       He lives vicariously through the Yorkin's, a seemingly ideal family who he develops film for.  Robin's narrative IS significant, as it gives many cryptic clues as to what the film's really about.  (SPOILERS--SPOILERS--SPOILERS) Sy collects extra sets of the Yorkin photos and puts them on his wall, seeing Jake's childhood as the ideal one he wished he had.  The background music by Reinhold Heil and Johnny Klimek (Run Lola Run) sets the melancholy mood of despair as we are given clue after clue as to his actual abused childhood, starting with the red eye effect in an actual photo of him and family.  Then the Deepak Chopra quote, ""What we fear most, already happend to us.""  Then his telling Jake he broke his collarbone as a kid by ""falling from a tree"".  The lid on his demons explodes when he develops photos showing Will's infidelity, then gets fired by a fascist boss. 
     Then the elaborate plan goes into effect.  He threatens his boss, leaving clues for the authorities, and finally in cathartic release acts out his own abuse, his abusive father taking him over.  Then the regression to the ideal childhood, hence the photos of objects a la Jake's photos. Importantly we don't know all this until the end, when he explains it to the detective.  Of course this will go over the heads of many in the mainstream audience, so we get the ""weak ending"" criticisms that show they don't get it.    This is a subjective jump into Sy's tortured world and the most appropriate comparison would be to Midnight Cowboy.  The parellel to Joe Buck's isolation and naivetee, his disconnection with the TV and radio shows he watches/listens to for example is strikingly similar.This film works on every level and if any justice exists will sweep the Oscars.",One Hour Photo

179,mpofarrell,Photo Positive/Photo Negative,7,10 September 2002,"In ONE HOUR PHOTO Robin Williams gives an electrifying performance as a photo lab technician in a giant retail emporium (generically named SAV-MART in the movie). A slight , bespectacled middle-aged man with nondescript features, Seymour ""Sy the Photo Guy"" Parish is fastidious in appearance (his blue work smock is always neatly ironed) and meticulous in his dealings with customers ( almost overly polite, he nimbly handles customers' rolls of film as if they were prized possessions). Sy's voice-over narration at the film's beginning stresses his obsession with photographic perfection and gives a strong clue that for Sy, work is everything. Inherent in the job is the role of voyeur, for Sy peruses the countless number of negative turned -to -positive photos as records of the day to day lives of his customers. He hones in particularly on the pictures of one attractive suburban family, the Yorkins, whose negatives he has been developing for years. When pretty mom Nina Yorkin drops off her film for processing, Sy never fails to ask how the family is doing, and charms Nina's young son Jakob with surprise gifts ( a disposable camera). When Nina's husband Will meets Sy for the first time while looking for an item in the store, he is nonplussed by Sy's overly-friendly manner and familiarity with family names and events. In this scene and in others, the audience feels a discomfort that is almost palpable. Sy Parrish is a desperately lonely man ; when not at work he spends his nights in his dingy, second - story apartment sitting on his sofa in a catatonic state, watching episodes of The Simpsons. His living room is spare and barren but for one wall that is covered with photos.......As a character study of a social misfit, ONE HOUR PHOTO relies heavily on Robin Williams' brilliant acting, which covers mightily for what is essentially a scenario that has been played out ad nauseam on countless made for t.v. movies. Mark Romanek, directing his first feature film after years of helming some of the best music videos (featuring David Bowie, Madonna and Nine Inch Nails among others), imbues this movie with an edgy atmosphere that makes it compulsively watchable if not particularly entertaining. His screenplay never really explains why Sy acts the way he does , and a vague reference by Sy toward the film's conclusion of past abuse doesn't dramatically satisfy. The other characters take a back seat to the Williams portrayal; not fully fleshed out, they seem to serve merely as victims to Sy's explosive rage. This film is, however, an impressive first effort by a promising talent, and a must see for anyone wanting to witness Robin Williams giving the performance of his life.",One Hour Photo
180,matty_mushroom1983,"Robin William's doing what he does best, not what he does normally.",10,12 February 2014,"If you've wondering why Robin's performance in One Hour Photo is usually considered his greatest performance by people who hate his comedy, myself, it's because you haven't seen the movie. He does NOTHING funny in this film. Wait, he does do something funny, but not Robin Williams-over-the-top-idiot-with-a-million-voices ""funny"", ill get to it soon. The point is, he's taken on the roll of a lonely, depressed and run down senior with a true passion for quality in is line of work (a negative printer at the photo counter or ""photo-guy""), a job where the mass production of sub-par material is the height of tedium in his existence, but occasionally he sees something that makes him smile with its beauty and wonder, and that's a real capture; smiling families, funny moments, and his favourite family, the Yorkins. This family he is unexplainably obsessed with, they don't realise it, and when you do it shifts the gentle persona of Si to one you suddenly want to watch our for. I liken this creepiness to the uncle you find out is a pedophile, in the scene switching between Si's flat, empty of personality and company, and the Yorkin's modern home where the mother puts the son to bed and tries to reassure her son that ""I'm sure Si has lots of friends"". At this point he's standing in his kitchen with a glass of juice, staring into a black void and can only be thinking of the cause of his anguish and distain. This has to be the darkest moment of the movie for me. This job I mention, the photo-guy job that rarely but surely gives him such a beautiful day every now and then, becomes his mental and emotional demise when he discovers the husband of the Yorkins is having an affair, through the submitted negatives of his mistress. There is one scene in the movie where he sits his car outside the Yorkins house and imagines himself inside their house, mentally masturbating over the idea of wearing the husband's sweater, using their toilet and watching their TV. This is the funny part i mentioned. They come home unexpectedly and he's referred to as ""Uncle Si!""From imagining himself as part of the family to finding out the husband of this perfectly moulded union is having an a affair has gutted him deeply and crushed all his faith in humanity. So he flips, doesn't he :)Williams' character portrayal is brilliant to say the least and and the direction of the movie itself is nearly as brilliant.

I really was interested to see this movie though, after viewing Insomnia and seeing what he could do in a darker serious role.I have to say Robin Williams performance as Sy the photo guy is truly outstanding. He elicits sympathy from the audience and really is a towering presence in terms of his acting throughout the film.The Yorkin Family played decently by Michael Vartan, Connie Nielsen & Dylan Smith are integral to the plot and each gives convincing if not outstanding performance, after all the film centres around Sy and his obsessive behaviour. Gary Cole as Sy's boss is okay, and he helps in pushing Sy over the edge.Also I have to applaud the fledgling movie director Mark Romanek, his minimalist approach to the sets and Robin Williams appearance paired with the very dark material worked exceptionally well. The sombre and thoughtful mood of this piece is great as it moves slowly but very deliberately through the story and covering some disturbing territory.This is a truly masterfully directed and acted movie and credit goes to the pairing of Romanek and Williams in pulling this off. 7/10",One Hour Photo

I thought the first hour was really boring, and it was all pretty much explained in the trailer.  When it finally started to pick up, I got more involved in the story, but ultimately the end was a let down.  With so many other thrillers out at the video store I'm sure you can find something better.  But if you are big Robin Williams fan, you might like it because he isn't ""funny"" (which isn't much of a reason to like this movie when you think about it, but it seems it is the popular reason listed on this website).  In conclusion, can't say I liked it, but I can't say I hated it either, better then Bicentennial man as far as boring Robin Williams movies go.

He knows everything about them because of the pictures they bring in. It is an interesting story. Nothing that can win it an oscar for best picture of the year, but it's good nonetheless.Robin Williams shone through in this movie. A film critic (I forgot who) called this movie Robin Williams' finest hour. This may be true. Robin Williams didn't need to prove to us that he is a great actor, but he proved it to us anyway. Even though he was the antagonist, you feel some sort of pity for him, and even want him to succeed. The movie was actually really good, overall.

I would also like to know where Savmart is Sy definitely knew about the affair between Maya and that lady's husband.

192,dholliday-imdb,"Nothing special, but interesting performance from Robin Williams",6,12 April 2015,"Robin Williams touched a lot of people (no, not like that) in a special way (stop it!). When he passed on, I witnessed quite distraught, hysterical reactions from some fans online. A few were even espousing the idea that Patch Adams & What Dreams May Come were decent films after all. While I'm not a big fan, I really enjoyed his turns as Popeye and the voice of Aladdin's Genie. The man had bags of energetic comedic talent, and his drama skills were pretty good too when not too sweetened with hardcore-saccharine. Yet the most effective comparison with a dramatic actor from his peership is when we consider Dustin Hoffman's turn as Tootsie vs Robin's effort in the Mrs Doubtfire outfit. The latter actor being for the younger and/or more sentimental type.This rather long introduction is just to explain that I generally wasn't fussed about his output, but One Hour Photo intrigued me...and more than a decade after release I finally get to see it. Biggest reason to watch/best thing about it: the character Robin creates here is genuinely believable. He's a living, breathing human being...damaged by his utter loneliness. It's an impressive performance and for me justifies his efforts back then to sell himself as a more serious & versatile actor.The film itself is rather simple, with the rest of the cast blandly portraying 2-dimensional characters. Gary Cole was only given a formulaic role to play, he could've done something special if the writing wasn't so singularly fixated on Robin's character. The family are all a bit yawn. The experience as a whole is mildly-absorbing, if unremarkable. Technically everything is quite competent, tho' again it's all very standard.The premise of the story is stimulating if, like me, you enjoy photography and are engaged in the many facets of the digital-vs-analogue debate. Some might feel the ideas here are outdated already, but there's still plenty of people out there who shoot film and then let their local store develop the images. Plus when the premise really is outdated in a decade or two, this movie serves as a reasonably-accurate snapshot of that era.Recommended for film buffs looking for a very different Robin Williams performance, and also for those interested in the potential illusion of privacy when allowing your analogue film to be developed by strangers.Not particularly recommended if all you're looking for is a gripping psychological thriller, it's just a little too average.",One Hour Photo

So often the award goes to the most sympathetic character and the voters give the nod to repay the character for his hardship or loss.  At other times, the Oscar goes to the actor that shouts the loudest or displays a rage of anger (Denzel Washington in ""Training Day"").  It takes talent and training to maintain a low key performance for two hours and make it believable (Sean Penn in ""I Am Sam"", Russell Crowe in ""A Beautiful Mind"" and ""The Insider"".

195,steve-575,Underrated gem of a movie. SPOILERS!!!,10,10 April 2004,"While this movie was neither a huge box office success nor is one of Robin William's more popular films, I found it to be very well-made and realistic.Most thrillers nowadays are very far-fetched and often tend to portray the antagonist as a one-dimensional psycho. This movie was very believable and did a terrific job of portraying Robin William's character Sy Parrish as a sympathetic but very disturbed figure. It is really hard to hate his character who seemingly just wanted to have a family of his own.Throughout the movie, you learn that he is very lonely, has no family and loves his job as a photo tech. You also learn that has become obsessed with one of his customers and her family, has illegally amassed tons of their family photos and frequently stalks them outside their home. As the movie progresses, Sy becomes more disgruntled until he eventually snaps. Even when he ultimately snaps, you still kind of feel bad for him in a way.While it may be argued that nothing was really resolved in the ending, I thought it was very appropriate. I really liked the fact that neither Sy (nor anyone else for that matter) was killed in the end. A lot of other movies will usually kill the villain because it is generally believed that he deserved to die. But that wasn't the case here as Sy was a very complex character.Lastly I felt that this movie was not overly long and really flowed well.

(At one point while Sy is spying on the Yorkins, his eyes are the rearview mirror of his car.) Using color, pacing, sound and excellent acting Romanek creates a subversive and unsettling portrait of our cultural neurosis. The most disturbing part of the film for me is how alienated the people are from one another and from their environment. The Savmarts of our world oppress us. Sy  isn't the only lonely character here and he doesn't destroy Yorkin family, the cultural of meaningless terminal greed pictured here has done that quite nicely.",One Hour Photo

200,scarecrowman,"Bold, Beautiful, and, Brilliant!",10,23 February 2003,"This is the first time I have been able to use the 3B review.  Then again it is the first time those words seemed to define a picture so perfectly.Ok first remark to the person who thought this film was dull.  I think the film makers owe you an apology for not casting Vin Diesel and Ja Rule in this film.  Also I understand that the lack of a hip hop sound track threw you for a loop.  Those damned film makers.  Don't they know real cinema? Don't they know a film needs T n A and a large, steroid injected bald headed one line actor to entertain the masses?  LOL!I usually respect anyone and everyone's opinion.  I hate using cliche come backs in defending a film such as ""You just didn't get it"".  This time along with the three Bs I can use that cliche comeback with pride.  ""If you did not like this film.  Then you just did not get it.""  Either that or you have lost the humanity within you.  You probably prefer dung to urine and probably prefer cheerleaders to poets.I know that nobody will get the same meaning fom the film, but everyone should get basically the same overall picture.  This film goes into an often untackled issue uncompromisingly.  That issue is that there are those who deserve the cake and get the dung.  There are some who get the cake who want the other cake, and then the other cake, followed by extra cherries. While some may think that Sy is actually insane.  I think this film portrays him as a loner who has lived such a torturess life that he finds other people's hapiness, in order to hold on to the idea that hapiness exists. The real shock was that he did not commit a single horrific crime.  He really did not even invade the people's privacy, he just kept a record of what he already saw.  I think this film goes deeper than what I got from it, but the basic point of the film is that we should never take the moments of hapiness for granted. We should strive to live life they way it looks in our family photos and not the way it looks compared to the movies.  This is a great lesson for the ""I can't be with you I have to find myself"" generation that sucks the marrow out of originality by using overplayed romance from irritating and unrealistic Romantic scenes on film and television.  Not to mention self proclaimed gurus like Dr. Phil and Oprah Winfrey.  That is why this film will be over most people's heads.  If you want to watch a smart film get your rear out of Dawson's Creek.One more point to mention.  I typically do not admire bleeding heart films such as ""One Hour Photo"".  So just to knock down some arguments you may throw my way.  It was a registered Republican who admired the liberal message of this film.  So don't go there my fellow Republicans.",One Hour Photo

203,jimboduck,"Best of Recent Robin Williams – 8 (Bright, clean, and nervous like a straight jacket)",8,21 November 2005,"When I think of all the recent Robin Williams movies I've seen, I'm left with a peculiar aftertaste. He appears in stylish, well produced films that don't really leave a lasting impression. Foremost in my mind are What Good Things Will Come, Bicentennial Man, and Final Cut, none of which I would recommend. They're all too busy.One Hour Photo stands out from the rest because unlike the others it's simple and effective. Williams does a thoroughly convincing job as Cy the Photo Guy, a character who epitomizes the privately obsessive side of human nature. That side we strive to squash on a daily basis to appear presentable in public.The effectiveness of simplicity shines through in every aspect of ONE HOUR PHOTO. The score is creepy. The photo lab is antiseptic. Williams' strained mannerisms suggest that he has too many secrets brooding in the subconscious. And the plainness of the local retail store and soccer-mom-suburbia confirms the suspicion that the neighborhood is too comfortable. The undercurrent of psychosis lurks precisely where life appears so ordinary.I was lost on how such a widely known Robin Williams movie could affect me so deeply, but the background of the director provided some insight. Mark Romanek hasn't worked on too many feature-length films, and most of his work has been producing music videos. That makes sense, because ONE HOUR PHOTO features a lot of well placed color against sterilized white. I don't know how to put it. It's the silent kind of creepy when you're watching a mime. It's like watching a skilled surgeon operating on a patient's leg. Camera zooms out to reveal that he's working on his own leg! (credit arnold for that one)Here's a shortlist of music videos by Romanek you can find on his 2005 Director's Label DVD:JAY-Z - 99 Problems; RED HOT CHILI PEPPERS - Can't Stop; JOHNNY CASH - Hurt; AUDIOSLAVE - Cochise; NO DOUBT - Hella Good; NIN - Perfect Drug; BECK - Devil's Haircut; EELS - Novocaine for the Soul; MICHAEL & JANET JACKSON - Scream; MADONNA - Bedtime Story; LENNY KRAVITZ - Are You Gonna Go My Way; EN VOGUE - Free Your Mind; KD LANG - Constant CravingWhile a noisy production could have driven you away, the simplicity of ONE HOUR PHOTO draws you in. Watch this movie if you're tired with THX explosions, if you're losing faith in Robin Williams, or if you're looking for some good old, quiet perversion.JYJimboduck-dot-com",One Hour Photo

205,Casey_Moriarty,Robin Williams' brilliant performance is what carries this film. . .,8,23 February 2003,"Williams- wow. This movie is one very well done character study- it shows a verylonely man, a very disturbed man, Sy the Photo Guy (RobinWilliams) who lives vicariously through his customers- specificallythe Yorkin family. Sy sees the Yorkins as the perfect family- he hasno friends or family himself, and he'd love to be a part of theirs.Every time he develops a roll of pictures for the Yorkins, he printsan extra set for himself- creepy. Then, when he discovers that Mr.Yorkin is having an affair, his fantasy of being part of the 'perfectfamily' crumbles, and he snaps. The film lacks action- but that'snot what it's about. It echoes Taxi Driver and 2001: A SpaceOdyssey. The best part of the film is Robin Williams in a truly greatperformance. The man was very much ignored at Oscar time- I sayit's the second best performance of the year, behind only DanielDay-Lewis' Gangs of New York role. I enjoyed very much listeningto Sy's philosophy of why photos are so important- with that voiceWilliams uses, it's really creepy. I love it. Recommended! 8/10.",One Hour Photo

208,jjh6519,Oscar Nom for Robin?,8,15 September 2002,"This film was far better than I expected.  *** SPOILER ALERT, SORT-OF *** What could have easily, on a number of occasions, turned into a story filled with cliches and formulas seen a dozen times before in movies about psychologically disturbed people, the director-writer chooses instead (to his credit) to make this a study of a character, with actual character development.  I expected, so many times, that a certain standard Hollywood plot twist would naturally happen, but it did not.  I thank the writer-director for such inventiveness and restraint. Robin Williams, along with the script and direction, takes what would otherwise be a two-dimensional character (Sy Parrish, or ""Sy the Photo Guy""), and develops him (pun intended) in various ways.  The most important way is to allow the audience see the peels coming off the seemingly rigid outside of an otherwise fragile, insecure, soft-in-the-middle, and pathetic human being.  But Williams is so good at this role, that we even are allowed to feel empathy (not sorry, not pity) for this lonely man, this truly disturbed, isolated individual.  And we even get to understand him, thanks to the writer!, quite the opposite of what we expect when Hollywood uses a plot about a dangerous person. This is not an evil person -- it is someone who desperately needs to feel loved and needed.  Then two events shatter his entire self-made life, and he becomes downright scary.When Sy's isolation and how he deals with it, is depicted throughout, the Simon and Garfunkel song ""I Am a Rock"" somehow comes to mind.  Also, early in the film, when we first see Sy sitting alone watching ""The Simpsons"" (a cartoon family, just as unreal as the seemingly ideal family he develops in his own mind), and as the camera pulls back, we see the extent of his obsession and madness.  But it reminds you of the Robert DeNiro character rehearsing at his home in ""The King of Comedy"".I think that Robin Williams should expect at least a nomination for best actor.  He is superb as someone who is both chilling and frightening and also who needs to be loved and treated with care.  His Sy Parrish might end up being as famous as Norman Bates and Travis Bickel.",One Hour Photo
209,vyperman7,Majorly Overrated!!!!!,4,6 September 2002,"***SPOILERS***   ***SPOILERS*** I want to start off by saying that I was looking forward to seeing this movie. It had all the elements of a great thriller. But that is not what I got to see. This movie was just awful!! Why it got good reviews and why people think so highly of it is beyond me!SPOILERS!!!!!! :The film tries to pass Williams off as a man obsessed with one particular family that has been getting their pictures developed by him for 9 years, ever since their kid was born. He works for the local Savesmart as the head of the photolab. However, all the movie does is go into the troubles within the family and show that Robin Williams has a crappy life. Williams is constantly shown saying high to the mother and boy when they come in, running into the mom at the mall, and watching the kid's soccer practice. Up until this point I was falling asleep. All of this that has nothing to do with any thing remotely thrilling lasts for the first hour. The only obsessive thing that they portrayed was a huge wall of every photo that the family has ever developed that Williams has in his apartment. Oh yeah, and when he is not playing Uncle Sy to the family that he likes so much, we get to hear all about how he makes photos, the size of the photos, what makes photos look professionally done and what looks amature.Then a woman comes into the Savesmart to get pictures developed. Williams thinks that he recognizes her but can't remember where he saw her from. After he gets off of work, he goes to his place and sees this woman's face in a picture dealing with the husband's work. The next day Williams is fired from his job, because of a massive amount of prints missing. Williams always makes an extra set of pictures for himself from every customer, and never marks it down or pays for it. After 11 years they finally find that out. You'd think that it would take them a lot less time to do so.The next night after he was fired, he goes to the Savesamrt after they are closed. Even though he was fired he still gets to keep his keys. He goes into the photolab, and looks into the woman's pictures. It turns out that the husband is cheating with this woman and there are revealing photos. He takes out the pictures of the husband and his mistress and puts them in with his wife's pictures. She finds out obviously, and then she does nothing and acts like she does not even care.For the last 30 minutes of the movie, Williams becomes obsessed on making the wife actually care that her husband cheated. So he tracks down the husband and his mistress at the hotel that they sneak off to. He makes them simulate a sex scene by knife point. He takes pictures of everything. Then he leaves the room while both the husband and mistress are fine. Then the cops manage to show up and arrest him.This takes us to the end of the movie. The movie starts out with Eric Lasalle holding Robin Williams in a holding cell and talking to him. He asks why he was so obsessed with the guy that he went after. He then throws a packet of pictures still in a manilla envelope on the table. That makes the audience wonder right off the bat, what could possibly be in there. Eric's character refers to the pictures as "" evidence"" that show Robin William's guilt. At the end of the movie, Williams asks if he can have his pictures back. LaSalle lets Williams have his pictures. Now we finally get to see what is in them, thinking that they are off the sex simulation. The pictures were off the hotel bathroom. The shower head, the shower curtain, a towel ,and a bar of soap. Very disappointing!!4/10 - I give it a 4 for a few funny scenes pulled off by Robin Williams.

He's such a comedy icon, it's always interesting to see him out of that element and as always, he pulls the role off beautifully.I was pleasantly surprised by the cinematography, score and pacing of this film. It keeps you on the edge of your seat, no differently than a classic Hitchcock film. It also has no ""fat"", meaning it is clear, concise and free of Hollywood clutter that bogs down the vast majority of films today.

Sy knows all of his regular customers and memorises them by what photos they regularly come to get printed, But Sy has an unhealthy obsession with the Yorkin family.The Yorkin family is a happy family of three, mother Nina her partner Will and their young son Jakob. Mother and son have been using that lab for 7 years getting their prints to the point Jakob calls Sy 'Sy The Photo Guy' unknown to them over the years Sy has been printing off separate copies of the photos to put on his wall.Mid way through the movie we see the descent of Sy, from the helpful man to stalker, always seems to be there, reading the same books and has a fascination of being known as Uncle Sy and work his way in the family unit.After an incident at work Sy is fired, and realising he will never be in the family unit he starts to up the ante in being top stalker...

I didn't know what to expect when I sat down to view ONE HOUR PHOTO but the unfolding story of Sy Parish mesmerized me. His tale is original, moving and emotional in a way you can't preconceive. There's also a twist at the end that you don't expect and that frames the main character in a less sinister, more sympathetic light. This movie is about photos and connections to other people and how the two tie together in time and place. You life in pictures versus your real life. To me, Robin Williams created a complex character out of a seemingly simple old man in Sy Parish. There is a fleeting beauty to this film, along with a happy sort of sadness.

It is Williams' best work since GOOD WILL HUNTING.  Along with INSOMNIA earlier this year he seems to becoming quite adept at playing the deranged.Have you ever thought about the guy behind the photo counter?  The one who takes your weekend film and turns it into snapshots? Did you ever consider who might be looking at those naked shots of your wife or girlfriend, you know what I mean, those last two shots you snapped of herjust to finish off the roll for developing? Well, after seeing ONE-HOUR PHOTO you'll never look at Cy the Photo Guy quite the same way again.The performances in ONE-HOUR PHOTO from Williams on down are flawless.

218,vivesi-1,My Experiment,4,19 December 2004,"I had written a negative review of ONE HOUR PHOTO a couple of years ago when it came out and then regretted writing it because I've since undertaken a more studied approach to films. So, I thought, I'll delete that comment and watch it again in the spirit of anticipating artistry. I'll be more charitable, I thought, see things that I missed before; I'll come out a fan. Of course, you know from my heavy-handed foreshadowing (borrowing one of the director's approaches) that it never happened. I like this film much less than I did the first time.To be fair, there are some successful aspects of this enterprise. At one point I noted that the film technique far surpasses the story. The movie is slick-looking, indeed. The use of color is rampant, albeit largely meaningless. The lighting is affective and needs desperately to be tied to a story and a character. The acting never caught my attention which is a good thing.But the movie is so painfully plodding that I thought at one point that the filmmaker must be a famous person's son who had a lot of money and a lot of Hollywood ties (look at the cast--even the day roles are names) and a nebulous idea that he ultimately couldn't pull off. I haven't yet investigated that theory but I did read that this is a former music video director. That explains a lot--visuals without meaning. This movie is contrived, manipulative, and follows all of the Hollywood clichés--it just LOOKS like it doesn't. One can only guess at the positive critical responses, but I'll bet you that none of the critics watched it a second time.This movie reminds me of smart people who want to write but who don't read. They're capable, perhaps, but nearly knowledge-free of the greatness in their chosen medium. As one IMDb user put it (and I'm sorry I can't remember who) ""art isn't easy.""",One Hour Photo

220,timtindy,aimless movie lacking in substance,1,30 September 2002,"This movie suffers from SO many problems that I don't know where to start, but I will focus (no pun) on the script and directing.First of all, the film attempts to be a character study and a thriller and it fails on both counts.  The Sy character is never fully realized (not Williams' fault) as the screenplay doesn't do anything interesting with him until he becomes unhinged at the end.  And that last tacked on scene that was supposed to add exposition did not ring true at all. Why not have flashbacks or delve deeper into Sy's psyche?  That would have been so much more interesting than the cursory rant at the end.*SPOILER ALERT*  And I am sure a 50-year-old man is suddenly going to go nuts after never having done that before?Other problems:  no 9-year-old child is going to say to his mom: ""I feel sad for Sy.  He has no friends.  I can just tell by looking at him.""  Yeah right, of course he can.  And HOW sensitive of this 9-year-old.Why didn't the wife confront the husband?The real problem with this movie is that there isn't enough material here to sustain a feature length film.

221,Evolvist,One Hour & Thirty-Six Minute Photo,7,20 July 2003,"I have a friend who will hear nothing good about Robin Williams (and that's cool, because there is nothing wrong with dissenting opinions-in fact I will always welcome the other side of the coin).  Nevertheless, `One Hour Photo' is just another example that proves my friend wrong, and if he doesn't like it he knows what he can do with his opinion.I did not set out to make a brief survey of Robin William's acting career, but `One Hour Photo' prompted me to do so.  Now, the chances are that Mr. Williams will never go down as one of the greatest actors of our (or any time), and rightly so.  However, his contributions to film cannot be overlooked.  I can think of no other comedian that has ever tried his hand at `serious' roles and actually succeeded the way he has.  I mean, Robin Williams does, in fact, hold an Oscar and has been nominated on numerous occasions.  What's more, unlike Jim Carrey (who might have a shot at the `serious' tip), Williams started with a dramatic role in only his second feature film!  That would be `The World According to Garp;' and along with such noble (if not pretty darn cool) efforts such as, `Dead Poet's Society,' `Awakenings,' `The Fisher King,' `Good Will Hunting,' and `What Dreams May Come,' we can see that he has risen to the occasion (sometimes in grand style) and he is not so much of a hack.  Which brings me to back to `One Hour Photo'There was nothing wrong with this movie; nothing wrong with Robin Williams' performance (he was convincing, well suited for the role, and showed nice acting nuances).  The movie had an interesting plot, it was well paced; it had a nice color palate, and it had a few subtle plot strokes.  However, I only feel compelled to give it a 7.6/10, overall.  I don't know why.  Maybe the movie was just too NICE.  But, I did enjoy it!  I will even venture to say that if Robin Williams had not played the lead, then the movie might not have been anything.Anyway, a `7.6' is not too shabby in my book.  If I saw it for 10 bucks, used, I would purchase it for my collection.",One Hour Photo
222,CCS-CRITIC,Familiarity breeds obsession,6,7 April 2003,"A photo developer Sy (Robin Williams) becomes obsessed with a family due to the fact that he has developed their photo's for many years.  This obsession is created by a willingness to believe that he is a part of this family because he has seen the family unit through different times in their life, whilst also having the burden of no family ties himself.
Robin Williams is remarkably eerie in the movie, and is a tribute that he is trying to broaden his horizons and get away from the party goof ball image, with films like this and Insomnia.  There are also particularly eerie moments as the camera prolongs shots of the young boy who Sy has watched grow up through the photo's for around ten years.What is particularly noticeable is the great emptiness in Sy's life, and the way in which he takes a hyper-professional attitude to each of his prints shows an obsession of not just the family, but of perfection in what he does.  For all that however, the script isn't too clever and although there are issues that would make you think twice about going to the developers, there simply isn't enough character to substantiate any emotion from the viewer.  The Yorkins are wooden, and the film tries to be a little too pretentious with some of the chilling moments in the film.

He plays a character called Sy who is a photo developer at a local supermarket who has obsessed about some of his clients for a number of years.  Cut off from society in general and with no close relatives his only solace in life is the people he serves and the dedication to his job.  But one family in particular appeals to him more than any other, and he soon obsesses to the extent where he follows the families footsteps, has a constant record of their photographs and wanders around their property.  But when he gets fired from his job for misuse of the equipment he fills his time by delving even deeper into the families life, uncovering deceit and turmoil.  Williams' performance is deeply disturbing and harrowing, because of the isolation Sy feels in a world where he sees so many faces in photographs in a day.  Williams is wonderful in his part.  The problem comes in not where he takes the movie or the movie's choice of plot and direction.  We are supposed to feel sorry and fearful for the family he obsesses about, and we are supposed to be left aghast at what will happen next.  The problem is that the family is so wooden and lifeless that I did not care what happened to them.  And that for me is where it fell down.  We get snapshots of the family, and hints of where their problems lie.  We know there's something not quite right when Sy's intuition tells us so.  But not enough detail went into the family for us to appreciate them and get to know them.  Therefore when Williams' character torments them through his problem with isolation, it's just a prelude to a weird ending.  A shame really because the film showed a lot of potential.",One Hour Photo

Possible spoiler ahead.... - 0 0 0 0 -Okay, it's about this creepy cat who works at the one hour photo department of an everyday drug store and gets obsessed with this one family who keeps bringing him photos.  That's about it.  He gets fired, goes a little crazy, finally snaps, and gets stopped before he does anything that terrible.  See what I mean?  There's not too much this movie can do.

225,brendanchenowith,Brilliant Surprise,10,2 May 2005,"I'd heard about this movie, it came and went, then finally I rented it on DVD and I loved it. Robin Williams' acting is a very brilliant surprise. Every shot keeps you interested in what will follow. From the opening scene with Sy wanting to look at his photos during the police interrogation, I kept wanting to see these myself. His creepy, put-upon persona reminded me of several people I'd been acquainted with over the years, and, yes, even reminded me of some of my own neediness.Even though I know he ends up getting into trouble, I kept thinking ""don't do this"" (making extra print copies for himself - taking photos of his ex-Manager's daughter - having a heated argument with the Xerox repairman, holding the knife on hubby Yorkin and his girlfriend, forcing them to simulate sex for the photos) but he did it anyway. The cinematography was pin-point perfect, with white fluorescent lights in the Sav-Mart, dim, almost sepia tone in his apartment, eerie bluish tint in the hotel parking garage during the police chase.I'd read Williams was originally offered the part of the store Manager, but I was so grateful he asked for the part of Sy instead. He became him. Just like Nicole Kidman in whichever project you happen to see her in, Williams becomes chameleon-like in this character. In other films of his, it's not like he actually becomes a character, more like him being a personality used to sell tickets (Patch Adams, Toys, Hook, Jumanji, etc. - none of which I have a desire to see). The last time he was really submerged into character was with Popeye (aha - Altman knew what to do with him).I bought this on DVD, yet I was at a friend's house and it was shown on FX this past Sunday evening, being the first time I saw this in a while. I'm definitely putting this one in the machine very soon.Now, going into Wal-Mart or any other store of that nature, seeing the One-Hour-Photo department just hasn't been the same.What leads me to think this is, in part, a satire on what darkness could lurk in the minds of department store employees, is that when I see these people now, I sometimes stop and wonder what their lives are like after 9pm (or 10 if you're in a Target).Some DVD fun - keep this on the main menu screen with the loop of the opening theme music, watching photos of Robin Williams flash on screen (designed after photo packets). Sit there and stare for a while, you'll be hypnotized.Nice features include behind-the-scenes footage with interviews interspersed with rehearsal footage and outtakes. Williams really hams it up, parodying the scene he and the other actor are about to perform.",One Hour Photo

227,morrowman2,A chilling but yet sad film.,8,8 May 2005,"After watching this film about 3 or 4 times I really understood the point. SY Parrish was truly a guy that I really felt sorry for because it was quite obvious that he had no one in his life. I strongly believe that even though SY got carried away with his obsession with the Yorkin family I feel that he truly cared about Jake and his mom. That is why I understood why he did some of what he did. SY however went about it the wrong way but all in all SY in a weird sense was trying to prove to Jake's Mother that Mr. Yorkin (Jake's Father) was a jerk, and I think Mr. Yorkin got what he deserved at the Hotel, the scare of his life to wake his A** up and make him see how he was hurting his family which at the end of this film it was clear that Mr. Yorkin felt bad about having the affair in the first place. The bottom line is this, even though this Movie was a thriller it was also sad and depressing-because I know people who are sad and lonely like SY and that is why my heart truly went out to SY because all he wanted was someone in his life to care about him.

Robin Williams is just fantastic as Sy, and definitely deserved an Oscar nomination. His chilling performance really made the movie. He is a very sympathetic character, alternating between detachment and forceful anger. The direction and supporting cast were very good, if not great. The dialogue was well done, and the use of contrasting colors added to the film's intense atmosphere. If you like psychological horrors, or just good movies, give this one a shot.I give One Hour Photo a strong 8/10. I have it as #93 on my top 100 list. If you liked this one, definitely check out Kubrick's 'The Shining' and try 'Panic Room'.",One Hour Photo

230,HCG714,"""One Hour Photo"" is over blown!",1,27 September 2002,"The worst film of 2002!! ""One Hour Photo"" tops my list of ""Worst Films of 2002"" right next to such duds as: ""Signs"", ""The Four Feathers"", ""Star Wars 2"", ""The Panic Room & ""Changing Lanes"", ""Blue Crush"" as some of the most over hyped, most over blown sillest films of 2002! I would define this year as the year of B-movies! ""One Hour Photo"" is the mother of all the worst films to come out of the 2002 film line up so far. I mean ""The Four Feathers"" was really bad, but ""One Hour Photo"" was really really bad! ""One Hour Photo"" was 100% over hyped, over promoted and under done. ""One Hour Photo"" was poorly written, poorly directed, with enough Z grade to come from not only Mr. Williams in years, but the entire cast as well! The characters were wooden, almost cardboard, the dialouge was wooden and broken, the acting was fair & the ending was like leaving a can of pop open over night on  the counter, flat and tasteless! I saw ""One Hour Photo"" the night it opened, and what a truely 100% waste of $8.00 to see. ""One Hour Photo"" is another fine example of how the Hollywood hype machine works in over drive to get there films noticed, and to sucker an unexpecting audeience into the film so it can make money. i think Hollywood knew that ""One Hour Photo"" was a bad film to begin with so that is why they over hyped it to the max! After seeing this film being promoted by Mr. Williams on every single talk show for over 7 months (& in most of Mr. Robins interviews he mad an ass out of himself anyways & he dosen't come off as an intelligent for that matter), a big fancy interview in EW magazine & being wowed at the 2002 Sundance Film Fest (Which I can't figure out why I guess the cold freezes people thinking?). I was expecting a really tight, edge of your seat thriller, what I got instead was a lazy, silly, tepid, PG-13 made for Lifetime Orginial movie film that would have played better on HBO. This film was the biggest scam since ""The Blair Witch Project""! Next to ""Insomina"" this was Mr. Williams worst role this year! The Rasberry Award for worst film for 2002 should have a tie bettween: ""One Hour Photo"" & ""The Four Feathers"". But Mr. Williams should get the Raseberry Award for Wrost actor for both ""Insomina"" & ""One Hour Photo""! Some silly, over-paid & very uneducated critic said: ""One Hour Photo will do to snapshots what Psycho did for showers"". What a crock!! This statement is the lowest, a truly tsteless thing to say about a classic film like ""Psycho""! This critic and most directors in Hollywood today need to go bak to film school and learn how to make high quality films & not some cheap thriller knock-off!  What I'm confused about is why ""One Hour Photo"" was rated ""R"" in th first place? Ther was no sex or violence in this film to give it an ""R"" rating unless it was another ploy by Hollywood to hype this film up! Thr trailer for ""Red Dragon"" was alot more scary than ""One Hour Photo"". During ""One Hour Photo""  half the audince laughed at most of the converstaions taking place on screen, or simply the other half of the audience just walked out before the end. The ending was a truly let down, almost a silly joke. The film ended very cold as well, it felt like the director was too scared to to take a risk and make ""One Hour Photo"" more daring and bold, or even more of a thriller. It seemed the director wanted to make more of a family film than anything else! Wait for $1.00 dollar theater, or better yet 0.99 cents rental day at your local video store. If ""One Hour Photo"" is even considered for Oscar gold then I know Hollywood is going to hell in a hand basket, & that most actors like Mr. Williams are in the film business for the money to pay there rent, & that they are not in the business of film to make high quality art! For making such a bad film Mr. Williams should lose some of his high salary and start from the bottom and work his way back up! I haven't seen one Hollywood film this year that even qualifes for any great reviews or even something that would show Oscar Gold, or even something that is worth seeing again!",One Hour Photo
231,tenn-noodlehead,Didn't quite satisfy in the end.,7,11 September 2002,"Okay, Robin Williams has long ago proven he can really act.  His recent foray into darker, more menacing characters is an interesting change.  His work here is excellent.  For a first time directing a movie, this is also impressive. The biggest problem we had with the movie was that we never got more than a brief glance into Sy's motivation and past.  We never really got to know the rest of the characters either.  We saw more of the Yorkin family than Sy did, so we weren't looking at them only through Sy's perspective, yet we knew only a little more about them then he did.  We never got inside of any of the characters, we never really came to know any of them enough to like or dislike them.  Although slow paced, the atmosphere was great, the tension and emotions built nicely and a couple of nice surprises delivered cleverly.  Overall worth checking out, just don't be surprised if the movie seems a little unfinished at the end.",One Hour Photo

233,Vladimir_Grozescu,I never thought I'd say this: Robin Williams' performance made me cry,10,11 June 2002,"*spoilers below*What an amazing film.  This is definitely Robin Williams' best performance ever.  He's so believable that you forget it's Robin Williams up there on screen; this guy IS Sy.  I actually cried at the part of the movie when Sy cried while looking through the pictures Jake took.  I never thought Robin Williams could make me cry, but he did... which is a good thing.  If you see this film, you'll feel how painful his empty and practically nonexistent life is.  Also, the dialog was unexpectedly realistic.  Besides Sy's explanation of why he did what he did near the end, other dialog that stood out was when Nina told her son that everybody knows that Sy's sad, and that they should just HOPE he feels happier.  It would've been better if they actually DID something instead of just hoping he would feel better, but, sadly, that's the way life is.  Only one thing bothered me: the very last frame!  What was that?  Why were we shown a happy picture of Sy with the Yorkins?  Did it represent how Sy still thought he was still connected to the family?  That last frame was very confusing and does nothing but hamper the ending.   Many people believe ""One Hour Photo"" will be a thriller (based on what they see in the the trailer), but it's the farthest thing from it; it's more like a drama... a really disturbing, heartwrenching, beautiful drama that few will see because of limited release.  Trust me, this film isn't for everyone, but those who see it will be satisfied.  Wonderful job, Robin!My rating:  9 out of 10 (It'd be 10 out of 10 if it wasn't for the confusing last frame)",One Hour Photo
234,pmakauloski2312,Amazing. Robin Williams plays the perfect creep,8,6 August 2015,"I had always wanted to watch this movie because i had seen so many Robin Williams movies but not this one. This movie is sharp, creepy, weird, thrilling and really, really good. I am still thinking about it days after watching it. Some of the film is even left to interpretation by the viewer so there is even more to figure out. The movie is about Sy, a photo clerk at a super store. Sy(short for Seymour) played by Robin Williams is a typical man in his 40's/50's that is a nice, lovable, loser that lives alone. His loneliness turns him mad. He becomes obsessed with a family (Nina, Will, and Jake) that regularly gets their photos developed by him. He makes copies of their photos and puts them on the wall of his apartment. He is so lonely that he dreams of being a part of this family. He buys the same book that he sees sticking out of Nina's bag at the store. At first, he wanted to be like an uncle to the family but then later on he wants to marry Nina and get rid of her husband Will. One of the creepiest parts of the movie is when Sy watches the family's son Jake (Dylan Smith) play soccer from the sidelines and acts like an uncle.Sy eventually gets in trouble for using the extra film to make the copies of the family photos and gets fired for it by his boss (Gary Cole). Sy completely loses his mind at this point, and is determined to get rid of Will by filming his infidelity. Without giving it all away, the ending is wild. I would say the first half of the movie is better than the second but I'm nitpicking.8.5/10 Very intense, very creepy. Williams at his best in my opinion. Not necessarily his best acting but his best character fit. Kudos to the director and supporting cast as well, it was very well done. Thrilling atmosphere and excellent music. This movie is gripping partly because its so cringe worthy at times how weird Williams' character is and how obsessed he is. Humans can be such odd creatures when they are alone for too long.",One Hour Photo

FACT:  Not all wives react immediately to finding out about their husbands infidelity. and who cares if the pictures took over an hour to process?   Robin Williams, known for over acting many times in other movies,  does a very good job of playing creepy guy beneath the surface of a sad and lonely man.

This is a powerful, interestingly ambiguous and non-judgmental, subtle portrait of a psycho - or is he ? The whole movie is very restrained in both filming and acting, yet very suggestive and often chilling; the story appears simple at first but it has  more depth than first meets the eye. Forget about supporting cast here, this is the story of one man and Robin Williams (as usual or for once, take your pick) more than suffices to make it grippingly successful.

Robin Williams is excellent as Sy Parish , the photo tech for Sav-mart.He plays it so creepy and so opposite of his usual personality. It shows his true talent when the actor disappears in his character. Few actors can do that. Robin Williams is one , Russell Crowe another. Sy's world is one in which the Yorkin family is the ideal family . Something, I guess, he did not have. As he digs deeper, he starts to see the cracks in the fine veener. Especially  the fact the Will Yorkin is having an affair with a co-worker. That shatters Sy's world. That and the fact that he gets fired because he is caught stealing from the company. Mainly extra prints of the Yorkin Family. Robin Williams is excellent. The actors who play the husband and wife ( Michael Vartan and Connie Nilsen) are good.The son is excellent. The argument scene between Will and his wife seemed forced and tacked on. This was a good film. Not for everyone's taste. It is also a departure for Robin Williams",One Hour Photo
239,Dehlia_,"Unsatisfying, but worth seeing",8,20 April 2004,"Robin Williams plays Sy, a photo developer at a Target/K-Mart type of store who becomes obsessed with a family whose film he has been developing for over a decade. The movie was fascinating to watch, often in its small details. It spends a lot of time looking like a photograph, and seeing itself from inside itself, if you know what I mean. One of the most fascinating scenes was a complete throwaway. The basic premise is that Sy is this totally invisible guy. He's no one, a nebbish, and no one ever notices him. From the vantage point of his non-existence, he builds a dangerous and terrifying obsession; he uses his invisibility to stalk a family that is happily ""normal,"" living on the other side of the invisibility divide. Gradually you can realize that we meet ""Sy"" all the time, and in this one, telling scene, Sy stops for dinner at a restaurant. The waitress knows him, asks after his family (whom she thinks is depicted in the photos he obsesses over), and so on. And it is there for the viewer to know that this waitress, too, is Sy. She is invisible to him, he doesn't see or notice her, but she knows him. Unfortunately, the story goes on to depend on more and more coincidences, both of unlikely circumstance and of converged timing, rather than staying in the viewpoint of ordinariness it has created. As one thing leads to another, it looks more like a movie and less like Sy working at Sav Mart, and that weakens the movie. Still, worth seeing. 8/10",One Hour Photo

245,cifra2,You won't see Robin Williams. You'll see Sy.,10,24 August 2002,"What is a masterpiece? Maybe a movie masterfully directed, powerfully acted, with a believable and deep screenplay and with a superb use of score, cinematography and art direction.Is One Hour Photo a masterpiece?I'm almost sure.Mark Romanek, better known for directing videos for bands such as The Rentals, makes his feature film debut with an original screenplay of his own about loneliness and the alienation of our society. A sad story about sad people, and a frightening tale with ordinary life monsters.Of course this is the kind of movie that is better watch without anything spoiled at all, so I won't bore you with the plot... instead, I'll go straight to the ""artistic"" evaluation of the film. Having said that, why not start with the cinematography? I have to say that this is one of the best uses of cinematography I've seen in the whole story of movie making... the cold, boring Sy (Robin Williams) life is full of cold colors that will remind you of Stanley Kubrick's ""2001""... but the irruption of Sy's ""family"" is underlined by a subtle change into ""Kodak"" style colors... that's the line between Sy's increasing madness and ""real"" life. The score, which we could consider minimalist is also perfectly used to underline the increasing tension and is no wonder that Romanek has a lot of experience shooting videos... the only score flaw, however is that some rithym reminded me a lot of Filter's version of ""One"" (as published in ""The X Files Movie"" soundtrack). This is one of those movies in which everything (art direction, costumes, cinematography, sound, editing) seem to match to perfection.For the acting, the supporting cast is believable, and Connie Nielsen is the stand out. She's a lovely wife and mother, but not a cliched one... she's believable. In fact, I bought this family as a real family, I easily forgot that these people were actors (the screenplay develop this characters to the exact point of making us actually care for them without distracting that the focus of our attention is Sy and his devotion for them).So here we get to the whole point of the buzz surrounding this movie: is this the best Robin Williams performance ever?Yes.This is not Robin Williams acting. This a candid camera work into Sy's life. How many times can you really say that after watching a movie? Not many, I guess. Robin Williams and Mark Romanek are under control of this movie and not in a single frame they lose it (well, I have just a problem with a shot... but it is a single shot and it is perfectly explained, so why really bother).And for the direction, I've just said it all: strong, accurate, perfect at acting and composition... the best director nod should be assured. Mark Romanek has achieved one of the best film debuts I can remember in a long time (maybe since Quentin Tarantino and Tim Robbins debuts in 1992 with Reservoir Dogs and Bob Roberts)... Romanek is not a promise, he is a reality.This film will be compared (it was compared, due to the similarity of the origins of Romanek and Spike Jonze) with Being John Malkovich.. but it is not an accurate comparison. One Hour Photo is a serious approach to its issues, while ""Malkovich"" played with surrealism in order to surprise the audience. In ""Photo"", it is the use of icons (as unexpected as a toy, for example) which can surprise you with unexpected references. As you can see, I really dug this movie, which was leaving me in awe in every scene... till a point that I can't do anything but surrender to the fact that Romanek's movie will play a very influential role in the next years.What about the Oscars? There is a difference between what it should and what it can be... Picture, Director, Actor, Supporting Actress, Original Screenplay, Score, Cinematography, Film Editing and Sound nominations should be in their deserved way. Reality is that given the competition, this may be overlooked and simply in the best of the scenarios get an Actor and an Original Screenplay nominations (maybe even wins). But as the reviews are highly positive, maybe the top 10 lists will fuel its chances and we'll see a One Hour Photo's clip at Oscar Night.Make Sy happy. Actually, he deserves it.",One Hour Photo

Photography and other techinal parts, like the soundtrack, or set design is also very good and very clear.The Yorkin house is very beautiful and so is Nina. I wouldn't mind getting a little psychopath over any of them as well...In the end, this is not, as I said, a good suspense movie, but rather a reasonable mix of other genres.

Everything, from the lighting (making the Yorkin's house warm and perfect, to making Sav-Mart cold and oppressive) to the performances of the actors is sensational. Robin Williams definitely gives one of the best, if not the best, performance of his life. His character goes from appearing obsessive and a social freak, to lonely and caring. We begin to sympathize with him.Connie Nielsen and Michael Vartan as Will and Nina Yorkin are perfectly cast. They appear good looking, young, perfect, but not in the Pepsi advert sense. Even Vartan's line about his wife wanting their life to look like it came straight from a magazine seems real and gritty. It is not the self-effacing humor that it would have been in any other film.Eriq La Salle's performance of the Detective Van Der Zee perfectly contrasts Robin Williams's Sy in the film's beginning and end bookmark scenes, as well as the rest of the film, and Sy's comparison with his and Will Yorkin's versions of fatherhood seems accurate and in context.Reinhold Heil and Johnny Klimek's score sets such a fitting tone for the film, and perfectly captures the emotion we are witnessing.Once the film is finished, it lives on in thoughts inside the viewer's head. It provokes them.9/10.",One Hour Photo

The photography is intelligent and deliberate, punctuated by flashes of abstract brilliance.The director very cleverly avoids imbuing the viewer with a false sense of familiarity by keeping the characters at a distance, and shows commendable restraint by not turning the whole thing into a hack-and-slash.However despite all the craftsmanship and care that went into it, the movie ends up feeling underdeveloped and poorly framed.

The story takes too long to get going and we are left with an hour of ""character build-up"" that leads to nothing other than some preachy words at the end. Unfortunately I was too bored to pay a lot of attention to the moralistic statement which closes the film but I do remember being some right-wing generalities with little or no philosophical, political or existential depth. Despite the attempt to make it a character-driven piece, no one is of any interest, as we don't learn much about them, including the lead ""Seymour"" or ""Sy, the photo guy,"" played by Robin Williams. Many ""plot points"" feel forced and heavy handed signals for the audience to get ready for the next sequence. To make things worse, pivotal events are not believable because we know they do not happen that way in real life and we are already too bored to even consider buying them for the sake of ""suspension of disbelief.""  To top it all, the cinematography is ugly to watch and the electronic music absolutely overbearing. If someone offers you the DVD or video for free, pass on it. Value your time.",One Hour Photo

Both are imbued with a sense of uber-Virgoan precision and orderliness that effectively reinforces the sense of emptiness in the life of the Yorkin couple, with their magazine-perfect home and ideal child, of which Si Parish (whose life is more obviously 'empty') so aspires to be a part.

Eventually the plot was too juicy and somewhat strange to pass up. Walked myself down to the bargain bin and scooped this up What I realized about 30 minutes in was for $2.95 I had hit an absolute home run. My feelings about Robin Williams were sandblasted away from my conscious, and if anything I thought for one of the first times in my life that he was an outright star and created a character so terribly hurt and introverted that I would find great pleasure in seeing that identical character in more films. I gave it a 9, and that's a dead solid indie 9. If it were a massive budget blockbuster with a theater full of friends you may not see it that way but it's the definition of intelligent indie making. There are no explosions or car chases so don't expect that. This is the PERFECT film for a dark rainy night by yourself. It moved slow and somewhat quiet manner but in the most positive light.All in all this film is in a niche. A wonderful little niche and everyone involved should be proud. It's one of those films you miss for 10 years (like myself) and then magically stumble upon expecting nothing, but instead end up asking yourself ""how did I miss this!?""",One Hour Photo
256,mgreene-2,Can you say Taxi Driver set in Wal-Mart?,6,13 March 2003,"One Hour Photo is a winding, artsy, cinematic mosaic of a movie that invariably succeeds on certain elemental levels while it fails on others. On the positive, the writing is for the most part original, clever, and witty - especially the narratives and how they metaphorically relate life experiences and photography. The set design was very well planned, appropriate, and the color contrasts are extremely visual and appealing. The editing is quite good based on the pacing of the movie, as there really aren't any obvious slow parts and the story transitions smoothly.However, on the whole the acting is inconsistent with Robin Williams and Gary Cole noticeably outclassing the rest of the lead cast. Additionally, the plot line is limited as the movie really doesn't make the viewer draw their own conclusions about what is happening. It is contrived and lacking sub plot. Let me expand, the basic premise of the characters is rather weak. They don't seem to think for themselves. Instead, the focus is on stimulating the viewers' sense of compassion for main character. A tragic hero, oh how sad - yawn. On top of that - the score is annoying, redundant, and particularly over-used. The ending is disappointing as well, for the most part being anti-climatic.In summary, the movie is a bit of an oddity - walking a fine line between artsy, independent film and a cliché Hollywood blockbuster. One Hour Photo should not be dismissed as rubbish or held up on a pedestal as a masterpiece. It falls somewhere in between, succeeding in some aspects while falling short in others. 6/10",One Hour Photo

Without giving too much away, I was pleasantly surprised that even though Robin Williams is playing a weirdo, he's not a pedophile or pervert (like I assumed from the preview), so it's an enjoyable movie without being grossed out.

260,Barry Lyndon-3,"Good Foundation, Poor Execution",5,24 August 2002,"While raves should flood in about Robin Williams, the film as a whole suffers from slow pacing, a mediocre script and, ironically, Williams himself.Mark Romanek seemed to go out of his way, to the film's discredit, to shatter his MTV video past.  There's nothing fast or flashy about this picture.  Not that I wanted ""flash"", but the rate at which this story unfolds is tediously slow and detrimental to the plot.  I enjoy films that take their time, but...  be interesting at the same time.The script seemed to lack the courage to go where it should have gone.  This WAS NOT the dark, disturbing film it's advertised to be.  Or maybe I've seen one too many Darren Aronofsky films.  There was a huge, very slow build up to what I felt was an extremely flat climax.  And while the ending makes sense, I would've preferred if the filmmakers took it to a colder, darker ending.The character of ""Sy the Photo Guy"" was to be a wallflower.  Someone who blends into the background of society.  And even though Williams does a great job, he is anything but a wallflower - he's a complete distraction. He's Robin Williams!  He's a big star.  It's impossible to ever lose Williams in the background of anything.  Every frame of film that went by, I just kept thinking, ""That's Robin Williams.""  Not ""Sy the Photo guy.""I think the film would have been better served with someone like William H. Macy, Philip Seymore Hoffman or Steve Buscemi as Sy.Williams was good, but it's the case of ""good performance, wrong casting choice.""",One Hour Photo

The Hidden Suburban Terror genre has been flogged to death lately and although this film has it's moments it is lacking in too many ways. The direction and cinematography are far, far, far too repetitive to have any real impact on the viewer after the first 5 minutes. The music is intrusive and often annoying. The total lack of a story would be forgivable if the film had some mood or suspense to it but it doesn't.

A shame as Williams was pretty good and the content could have been done better in more skilled hands.",One Hour Photo
262,kavenga,A promising directorial debut combined with yet another surprising performance by Robin Williams,7,1 March 2003,"When the movie ended I was momentarily upset because I felt the climax was too vague.  But the more I thought about it, the more things fell into place.  If you like your movies, crystal clear and are expecting Hanibal Lecter, this picture is not for you.  On the other hand, if you occasionally like something a little more cerebral, that perhaps makes you uncomfortable, and forces you to ponder optional realities, you're about to take a ride on a moral roller coaster.  At the end, ask yourself, who is the bad guy and who is the hero?SPOILER  I felt that Sy took the pictures of his manager's daughter, not primarily to get back at him, but rather to purposely attract attention. He knew from his job that the pictures would result in the authorities being called.  He wanted them on his trail because he wanted to lead them to the adulterous William Yorkin.  When Nina Yorkin failed to react to the real photos of her philandering husband the way he'd hoped, Sy decides to give her some graphic `booster' shots, and give her husband a wake-up call at the same time.  Only when Sy is sure that the police have arrived at the hotel does he attempt to make his escape, thereby insuring the police will also encounter Yorkin and Maya in their hotel.  Thus, Sy makes it impossible for the Yorkins to go on living a lie.  I feel Sy believed he was saving them for their sake and for their son.  It's left open to you whether or not you think he succeeded.As to theories about the snapshots at the end, I seem to recall the police said there were TWO rolls of film, one in Sy's bag and one still in the camera that he left in the hotel.  At the beginning, the detective says `We processed the roll of film in your bag.  They are not very pretty pictures' and  `What did William Yorkin do to provoke you?' implying they are prints from the first roll that we see Sy take of Yorkin and Maya--but we never see those prints.  Instead, at the end of the film, we see the prints from the roll that was still in the camera.  But, anticipating the former, we are confused, stunned or surprised when we instead see the bizarre shots he took after he returned to his room.  The director leaves it to the viewer to interpret the meaning of those.As to the family photo that preceeds the credits, Robin Williams said (on the DVD) he felt it was Sy's dream of the way things might have been or could still be.  The director said it was up to the viewer.One Hour Photo did contain some flaws as noted her in other reviews. However, given that it was Mark Romanek's first screenplay I think we should cut him some slack, and look for something even better from him next time. My rating, 3.5 out of 5.",One Hour Photo

264,mashby,"Although the movie is a bit stylized and somewhat sterile in it's storytelling, it's a very engaging movie.",8,21 April 2003,"I'm a big fan of Mark Romanek's work as a video director. I think he's a lighting genius and his hyper reality style makes the artist look ultra-perfect. Mark bring this artistic style to his directorial debut. Although I'm a big fan of it, I did find it a bit distracting in a movie format. According to the director's commentary on the DVD, his intention was to make the movie somewhat hyper realistic, but everything is just a bit too squeaky clean.Yet, this fits the story somewhat, in that the characters are somewhat stereotypical. The dialog is fairly good, but in some of the more deeper sections, the dialog is a bit lacking. The relationship between the Mrs. Yorkin (Connie Nielsen) and the Mr. Yorkin (Michael Vartan, of Alias fame) is one of the weaker points of the movie. They simply didn't have much in the way of chemistry and their relationship wasn't clearly established. You know that they have problems in their relationship, but it's vague and un-authentic.The standout performance has to go to Robin Williams. What was most impressive about his work in this film was his ability to condense himself into such a quiet and contained character. We all know him as this over-the-top extrovert and in this role he is supposed to blend into the background, which he does. When he blows his gasket, which you know he's going to do, you imagination just runs wild. He's such a lonely character in such need for some type of contact that you just feel for him.Another performance that surprised me was that of Dylan Smith, who plays the Yorkin's son Jake. His role wasn't all that large, but he really did well in it. You could tell he was really listening when he was in scene and he did a lot of small movements, like playing with a toy somewhat distractedly, that just seemed so natural. This was his first role in a movie, but you wouldn't know it from watching him work.Although the movie is a bit stylized and somewhat sterile in it's storytelling, it's a very engaging movie.

This is not an action movie, but very much a suspense movie in the Hitchcock tradition. Not for hyperkinetic teens -- no big gunfights, extended chase scenes, or fireballs -- but for adults who like suspense.  It is like a Shyamalan film without the gore, and nothing like ""Silence of the Lambs"".I am always amazed when Hollywood does something original.  But this one managed to surprise me constantly -- I had no clue about what would happen next at the big plot turns.BIT OF A SPOILER:The appeal of One Hour Photo would be a lot broader if they could give away the fact that nothing horrible happens and there are no blood and intestines.  (Well actually there is a chase scene.)  In fact, it has a happy ending and is something of a ""feel good"" movie, albeit following an hour of nail-biting.  Again, it is very much like The Sixth Sense, or Signs, in this regard.I don't go for ""artsie"" movies, but One Hour Photo has a plot that kept me riveted from start to finish.  This is really the best movie I have seen all year -- I was on the edge of my seat from start to finish.I have disliked Robin Williams in every movie he has made for the past 5 or 10 years -- for me, this is his first major success in drama.

In this case, the pictures of the Yorkin family which Sy has done for years has given him such pleasure that he sees himself as he puts it in 1 creepy scene as ""UNCLE SY."" It's remarkable to see Robin Williams who I've loved for his remarkable turns in Aladdin, Jumangi, Flubber and other comedies to be playing such a lonely, sad and perhaps sympathetic character. He is amazing in showing his loneliness, especially in his scenes at his home and how he sees himself as a member of his family by saving a copy of all their pictures in that frightening collage in his house. His silence and sad isolation from everyone is chilling, and then Williams' expertly explodes in 3 powerful scenes which you will know once you see them.In addition, the film doesn't tun into a slasher like I first feared when Sy is fired and takes the knife from the Savemart. Instead, it's a red herring and the director and Sy lead us down a curvy path where he gets revenge on his boss by doing what he says a snapshot originally was, "" a hunting term."" There's another scene where Williams sits in his car near the Yorkin home, and we see him stealthily going through it. The director amazingly is able to confuse the viewer into losing track of what's real and fantasy, and though Williams' is only talking to the dog watching TV in the living room the effect of the scene makes it feel wrong, he shouldn't be there and honestly this along with the eyes' scene were the films creepiest moments and no blood/gore was needed. Connie Nielsen is great as is Dylan Smith(Jake) in showing how even such a happy family like them has issues, which the director teases wonderfully between Mr. and Mrs. Yorkin till ""Uncle Sy"" sees the truth himself in the photo lab. He then take sit upon himself as he later says, due to his anger at Mr. Yorkin for neglecting and abusing his family to expose him to his family and what better way then with a picture which ""says a thousand words.""It's a shame that Williams' didn't get more acclaim for this part,though Ebert and others(2003 Saturn Award) saw what myself and others did. In the light of his tragic death, this is the first full movie of his I've seen since then, his suicide shocked me and my family who were all fans of his work.)

I liked it a lot when it came out a couple years ago, so I saw it again on DVD with the commentary by the director Mark Romanek and Robin Williams turned on. Hearing what they said reveals a lot about the outtakes and the pranks that Robin did. He still is a funny man but just wants to challenge himself with acting roles that are not as comedic as his past work. Also, Robin Williams said that this is actually his first movie that he made a commentary on because it was his first role that he barely saw himself as the character he played (Sy Parrish) in real life. In his past work, he said that he would have trouble watching himself because he would be too critical on his acting since he could relate with a lot of the past characters and roles he did. Anyway, as Robin Williams requested in the commentary, when people ask about what One Hour Photo is about, say ""It's inexplicable, just watch it."" Definitely watch it. Just a precaution though that this film is rated R with some sexual content and adult language in it. If you can look past the dark scenes, it's a great story that is engaging and interactive with the audience. Enjoy a very well filmed movie. If you like it, watch it with the commentary on and you'll hear about a lot of stuff behind the scenes and thoughts on certain scenes that were pretty entertaining.

I wasn't disappointed. One Hour Photo's slow, almost snail-pace, storytelling, stunning use of color, startling imagery, and misguided dream sequences made me think of one director...the late Stanley Kubrick. I felt elements of The Shining, 2001: A Space Odyssey, and Eyes Wide Shut as Sy Parrish went about silently stalking, and living vicariously through, the Yorkin family.  Robin does an excellent job just as he did in Insomnia and What Dreams May Come elevating him to the head of the 'comic actors' class (Jim Carrey, Tom Hanks, and Marlon Wayans being the others). While not necessarily a surprise ending, the climax did take me in a direction that most films of this nature just don't.

Not only because of the story, but the sound design also contributed to the overall vibe! The story consisted of Sy, a pure good intentioned film developer, obsessing over a specific family that he's developed photos of for years. This leads to him finding more information about them, Stalking them, and then exploiting them.What I love the most about Robin's character, is how he brings a humane charm to such a secretive, sick individual. And at times he might have a short temper, but he's always kind and well mannered. This all changes with a sudden spark of anger. He comes across a photo of the father and another woman together. This eventually leads to more stalking, a greater mental decline, and him getting fired from his job!Now if you're into Psychological thrillers, you should definitely give this movie a shot! Whether it's for Robin's striking performance, or Brian Emrich's spectacular sound design. But overall at times the acting felt by the numbers and the story fell flat for a moment.

Each time he humbly ingratiated himself to the Yorkin family members, his sickening behavior became more nauseating - the hidden manipulations, the deceit and the prying. I saw him as a clinging, destructive parasite and I wanted to hit him. And that's the creative talent of this film: it made me believe the story. Robin Williams is terrific in this role.

279,JT-Saint,The Dark Side,8,29 August 2002,"Mark Romanek directs an interesting look into the mind of a lonely and desperate man.The film is a little slow to start with, but manages well to develop the character of Sy , a photo-lab technician, who grows an unhealthy obsession with one of his customers and their family.Intelligently handled, using the point of view of Sy, we're drawn deeper and deeper into the psyche of what, on the surface, would seem an ordinary man, but reveals himself to be anything but. Williams creates a believable character, one we can empathise with on many levels, in his most realistic performance to date (this is partially due to the fact that we have grown accustomed to him playing fluffy roles).All in all an impressive directorial debut for Romanek in an intelligent look at the darker side of the human psyche.8/10",One Hour Photo
280,pogo747,One Hour Snoozer,6,10 June 2003,"One Hour Photo's dull plot and lifeless characters leave a lot to be desired. Williams is not totally convincing in this role, and details seemed contrived and sloppily tacked on in a desperate attempt to give the characters some depth. The writers have given all the characters a cursory treatment, never revealing much about the Yorkin family's relationship or fully developing Cy the Photo Guy's personal history. Easily the most believable character in the entire movie is Yoshi, the shop assistant, who gets about 5 minutes of total screen time. The ending is wishy-washy and provides no sense of resolution.One Hour Photo fails to thrill or suspend. The plot is boring and dull, leaving me feeling like I've seen this movie before. Not much really happens and there isn't anything creative in here. Watch Se7en instead.C+",One Hour Photo

(That actually made me jump)The movie is stunning although the movie is just Sy's problems and Sy stalking, it needs an actual storyline to it.Great job Mr. Williams, I am impressed!

283,Mister13,Mark Romanek will help save the Film Industry,8,20 February 2003,"I have been following Mark Romanek's career since he directed Lenny Kravitz's ""Are you Gonna Go My Way"" video, and David Bowie's ""Jump They Said"" and ""Black Tie White Noise"" videos (No I am not forgetting the incredible NIN ""Closer"" video). His style of direction and creating basically worlds have done much to force music videos and movies to do what Studio execs do not want to do...evolve.I have waited a long time for a visually stunning movie to come from Romanek and One Hour Photo delivers, making the normal seem creepy, and the every day seem dreamlike almost whimsical. I would have to agree that it is very Kubrikian but only merely because it is different than what we are used to seeing.The story in itself is about a loner, who wishes to be a part of a family that frequents the photo both where he works. His story is a sad one but also in a way it seems like he is better off than he thinks he is in a weird way.The story is tight, shocking, and creepy in it's sterile normalness. I highly recommend it and can only be disgusted by the fact that it received an R rating (aka kiss of death) for what I assumed is the showing of the nude male and female body. I think if more films that looked this beautiful and also made you think (and received a fair rating PG-13) instead of paper thin shlock like Fast and the Furious being hailed as 'the best movie ever', Movies would actually be held up to the standard that One Hour Photo so easily reached.",One Hour Photo
284,lifeinaslan,An outstanding One Hour,8,14 September 2002,"One hour photo is an outstanding piece of artistic work. From beginning to end Photo delivers. Between the hour and a half Photo has some very slow parts only to build you up to the suspense. All in all One Hour Photo could of been made into a one hour movie and still be as good or better than it is now. Do not get me wrong One Hour Photo is one of the better films I have seen this year. Robin Williams really stepped up his career this past year or two (see also Insomnia). He is now in my book for one of the most versatile actors to date. Connie Nielsen (Nina Yorkin) is great like usual- from Mission to Mars to Gladiator Connie Nielsen is a well developed actress that just has not got the name for herself yet( hopefully she will, she is great). Eriq LaSalle is a great suprise actor in this film playing a smooth not over-acted cop. He brings to the screen necessity of a cop character - nice to see him in something great after E.R. Director Mark Romanek makes a wise choice for his first hit film - should have a great career in his future if he keeps this up. It seems he kind of over did it with the nudity but it wasn't entirely bad, it wasn't like it was a Porno. The end will leave you on the edge of your seat (cliche for all suspense movies, but this really does). You could not ask for anymore out of any involved in this picture. Last the composition for this film is absolutely amazing. The composers from Twyker's Run Lola Run and The Princess and the Warrior create a smooth and paced film score that is one of the better ones i have ever heard. The score fits the film so well that during the semi-slow scenes the music keepes you intrested. What a GREAT film - in my opinion a MUST SEE! One Hour Photo - 8/10",One Hour Photo
285,Diss,"Good acting, but the best thing about this film is the Simpsons",6,13 October 2002,"It seems people are all amazed by Robin Williams performance. And I agree it is good. But he has done serious movies before, we know he is capable of this. And there are another dozen actors who could have had equal if not superior performances. So the acting is good, I'll give you that. But good acting does not make a movie alone.   The characters are average. Si being the most interesting of those. The family was kind of weak if you ask me. They aren't interesting enough for me to take an interest to. I can't see what Si sees in them. The little boy is the only redeeming thing about them. I certainly wouldn't stalk that family.
 The writing was horrible. I won't say the plot is horrible, as it was interesting enough to get me into the movie. And the plot is good enough to build suspense near the end. But some of the dialogue and the entire ending is horrible. Also I don't agree with the opening scene of having Robin Williams sit down in the interrogation room. The plot was already pretty obvious, but this made it even worse. And the dream sequences seemed to be put there to add more suspense for a film that really isn't about suspense. Although I will add I liked the scenes where Si follows the family in his car.  But upon seeing the Simpsons in this film, I seriously wanted to see the rest of that great Simpsons episode. That is sad commentary on how good the film was.  In summary I feel this was a great idea for a film. Better writing, directing, and better actors for the family would have made this a great film. As is, I feel it is an above average film lacking good writing.",One Hour Photo
286,l_a_t_e_r_a_l_u_s,Great movie which has Robin Williams in the performance of his career,10,5 October 2002,"The story, in case you don't know, is that a one-hour photo employee named Sy (played by Robin Williams) is obsessed with a family that frequently visits. From every roll of film they bring in, he makes copies just for himself. He soon begins to imagine that he is a part of the family. He really does like these people, and wants nothing more than for them to like him. He gives the 9-year old boy free toys and such from the store he works. He does lots of things in hope of them liking him. I don't want to say that much more, in fear of giving too much away, but it gets extremely disturbing.It would be a crime to not give Robin Williams an Academy Award nomination for this role. He does this so well that while watching it, you sometimes forget that this is the same person that was once a loveable character like Mrs. Doubtfire. By far Robin Williams's best performance to date. The other performances in this movie were also convincing. But this is Robin's show.
Mark Romanek does a great directing job and writes a great screenplay here. One hell of a movie debut for him.To sum it up: ""One Hour Photo"" is my favorite film of 2002 so far. Robin Williams gives us the performance of his career, and Mark Romanek comes off with one of the best debuts in recent memory. This movie is highly recommended.",One Hour Photo
287,aorourke55,Good acting but dull,3,19 January 2007,"There were good performances by Robin Williams and others but the movie was dull overall and very disappointing compared to the positive reviews.I thought Sy might become a serial killer who bores people to death: a forlorn guy in ugly clothes trails his victims around food courts, quoting Oprah and reciting his medical history until they beg him to shoot them.I think the movie mostly appeals to egomaniacs who think strangers are interested in their photos.

I keep telling them that main stream Hollywood movies are rarely subtle... they hit you on the head on all fronts, visual and musical etc. etc. A good example of that is Photo. It is not a bad film but after the first 10 minutes you know where it is heading and from there on there is no escaping the stock characters, the stock situations and the stock explanations. Too bad because there is good acting and clever sets. Also, the last minute redeems the movie a tad because the ending, while using a rather hackneyed explanation for the hero's behavior still leaves us puzzled as to what the final resolution of this story is. This is not a bad thing as it gives the viewers further entertainment and mind stretching as they write their own scenarios after the curtain has fallen and the movie is discussed over coffee....",One Hour Photo
289,RJ135,Very good film-making (spoilers throughout),8,25 September 2002,"Ok, I'll skip the overview since you already know what happens in the movie. There is really very little to dislike in this movie.  It is brilliantly directed and the cinematography and editing is superb.  Oh yeah, and Robin Williams is a phenomenal actor.  There is also a lot of meaning in the movie if you are willing to look for it.  The white color motif is very obvious, and there are several shots that make beautiful and telling use of the mise en scene.  The ending was perfect, given Sy's character.  I believe some people were thinking that Sy was going to kill the couple at the end, but that just wouldn't fit with the Sy that we are presented with the whole movie.  He's not a killer, he's not even really a bad guy, he's just misguided a little (ok, a lot).  To explain the ending for those who didn't catch it, Sy had two rolls of film (one in the camera and one in his bag). He did take pictures of Will and Maya in forced sexual positions, but the pictures that Eriq LaSalle's character hands him are the ones that he took of the little things; the remote control, the toilet, the sofa, etc.  Early in the movie, he says ""Nobody takes pictures of the little things.""  This is also why he liked the pictures that the little kid took, because they were just of the everyday things that people take for granted.",One Hour Photo
290,francobulgheoz,It works because of Robin.,8,21 October 2019,"I have never heard about this film until last week. I did not know what I would walk into when watching it, based on the fact that Robin Williams is a usual reference for comedy. Nevertheless, I was not disappointed.He simply is a great, great actor. He pulled off a role that not many would expect from him, and I found it easy to believe and follow from the very beginning.The movie sets a tone and atmosphere from scene 1 that anyone can already find a bit disturbing. When we see his photo wall this atmosphere changes to a darker one. I believe cinematography and the subtle use of music, only rising when the plot did, were of great help for the message that was trying to be transmited. At times monothematic, at times oddly colourful, at times gritty. I think the cinematography, which is ultimately a relatable one, was very well handled.Direction was alright. I liked most of the shots from the beginning, although the movie ended up having classic and usual uses of technique.The plot is interesting and I liked the pace with which it was followed. What I did'nt like was the ending. I believe Williams's characters had potential for either a much more bloody or a more intense development. The film ends and one can feel that missing piece when seeing everyone ends up alright and unharmed, other than the fact of the affair.Secondary characters were powerful enough. Though they were'nt really explored, the kid did alright, the mom did to, and the dad as well. Gary Cole's character was the secondary one that interested me the most. And I would've love some more complicity or involvemente from Yoshi, the 2nd photo guy.In conclusion, if the ending went through a different path, the movie would be a much more remarkable and memorable one. Nevertheless, it pulls the desired effect thanks to a clever casting on Robin Williams.",One Hour Photo

293,ghostlife17,Here We Go Again (I WISH),7,21 September 2002,"MAN, this could have been so much better!  A great idea + inspired casting (a sedated Robin Williams) should have equaled a creepy psychodrama that actually works. But it doesn't. And the technical pedigree alone should have guaranteed some results. The work of Fincher favorite Jeff Cronenworth (cinematographer for ""Fight Club"" as well as decent camerawork on ""The Game"" & ""Se7en"") plus a soundtrack by the guys responsible for the music in ""Run Lola Run"" should have added up to something more than this. But of course it doesn't. And it's really a shame. Because everyone knows there's really only a few choice movies made every year, movies that you'll actually spend your hard-earned cash on and more importantly, not feel bad about it. ""One Hour Photo"" was on my short list for 2002. I was truly looking forward to seeing it and came away mostly disappointed. Oh, believe me, I got the jokes. ""Seymour and Parrish"". Funny. Sy's reaction to Nina's non-committal response upon finding out a certain something about her husband. Very Funny. Great. But I didn't come to see Madcap Robin. And the narrative is weak. Why have the opening bit at all? And why have the ending, for that matter, if you're going to ruin it? The climax (or the lack of one, I should say) is transparent, heavy-handed, and ultimately, a letdown. Maybe they should have called this ""One Hour Used Cars"" because you end up feeling so cheated. In all fairness, I should say you can tell they tried, they really did. But the end result is a picture that looks beautiful, but not pretty enough to carry its' lackluster storyline.

Is this just another look at an American psycho?  Do we really need to see another person go crazy?  Don't we see enough of that in real life, in real news -- need we make up more of these stories about people who terrorize others. No matter the reason, or the ending differing from other typical Hlywd stories -- it's still the same thing we're being sold -- about a man who goes off his rocker and terrorizes other people -- and, ultimately, you want to ask the artists involved: why?  There is nothing redemptive here, no room for change, or hope.  Just a sick and hurt person, who has injured others in his pain.

295,Kmark1293,Thrilling Hidden Gem,8,1 October 2014,"One Hour Photo has the suspense and subtleties straight out of a Hitchcock movie, but takes place in a more modern setting. This underrated work of film stars the late Robin Williams as a photo developer for a local store who has taken an interest in the Yorkin family through the family pictures he works on. This is truly one of the most underrated and overlooked movies to come out in recent years and it really shows Mr. Williams' acting abilities when it comes to being immersed into a chilling character.The story line, though goes off the beaten path a few times, showcases a good amount of suspense and atmosphere to keep it engaging. What makes One Hour Photo a standout from most thrillers in it's genre lies in it's avoidance of the usual clichés and nuances which makes the twists and turns all the more effective. It quietly studies the main character of Sy Parrish whose bleak sense of loneliness carries the film throughout it's well-written plot. The pacing may leave some viewers underwhelmed, but it is well worth it when given the proper chance.All of the actors do a pretty good job with their given roles, but it is ultimately Robin Williams who steals the show. The psychopathic portrayal of Sy Parrish shows the level of range Williams has as an actor. Unlike most characters in thrillers where it's easy to identify the good guy from the bad guy, the character of Sy is not so easy to distinguish where you might end up feeling both disgusted and sympathetic towards his motives. Regardless, Sy is a quiet, subtle character to study for and is one of the more memorable performances from Robin Williams' career.The use of lighting and cinematography brings in a chilling atmosphere that show you the bleak world of Sy's twisted fantasies. All the shots can range from blank to dark within the story and it really is a fascinating work of film to look at. The musical score also adds a nice touch of suspense to this already engaging thriller.In the end, One Hour Photo will remain of the most underrated thrillers of the last 15 years and I hope it will continue to get the recognition it rightfully deserves. The engaging story, creepy atmosphere, and a strong performance from Robin Williams makes this film worth recommending. And after all that I've talked about this overlooked gem of a film, I giving it an 8 out of 10.",One Hour Photo

The film is gorgeously filmed and executed. In fact, the two big stars here are Robin Williams as ""Sy"" and Writer/Producer Mark Romanek, with Cinematographer Jeff Cronenweth winning ""Best Supporting"" role. The film looks and feels simple - deceptively so. The colors, visual and sound effects, and even some snippets of music are derivative of Stanley Kubrick's ""2001: A Space Odyssey"". But Romanek quickly takes us from wariness over these parallels to a comfort zone of acceptance, as he unfolds the similarities between Kubrick's ""HAL 900"" computer and the Sy as played by Robin Williams. Sy, like HAL, is an intelligence so detached from the human race that he can not connect to others except through a third party communication medium - his pictures. Like HAL, Sy is excellent and precise at his job (photo developer), but becomes consumed by the perfectionism he perceives as required to fulfill his niche in life. Sy's progression towards insane actions accelerates when he is pushed over the edge by a trauma that threatens his world. He, like HAL, becomes completely immersed in his version of reality, to the extent that he no longer see nor understand the consequences of his increasingly radical actions as he focuses in on an isolated ideal that ultimately means the destruction of his carefully constructed immediately ""family"".Be sure to arrive in time to see the beginning of this movie in order to be properly set up for the progression of events, as the beginning and ending make a satisfyingly complete loop, perhaps leaving us with a little more compassion and understanding after having met Sy.",One Hour Photo

NO.In it's defense the movie does avoid a lot of stalker movie cliches, but dodging the old and tired does not necessarily mean that it's good, since the filmmakers hardly give us anything to fill the void left by avoiding the cliches.

306,long_christopher,Developing an obsession,7,24 February 2007,"Mark Romanek's debut film, One Hour Photo, is a gutsy and gripping psychological thriller. The narrative follows a Photographic Lab Technician, Seymour (Sy) Parrish played by Robin Williams, who is a lonely, sad, creepy character living his life through other peoples photographs. He develops a dangerous obsession with a particular young family whose photographs he has processed over the years. Through his work he accidentally uncovers a less than ideal family situation, which he seeks to rectify.This film takes place in flashback. Voiceovers are used to drive the narrative and to heighten suspense by unnerving the audience. These are often Sy's voice-overs relating his personal knowledge on photography and applying his photographic insight to the narrative. For example in one scene Sy explains that a huntsman once noted that all the kills he had made on a particular day were hurried shots taken without deliberate aim, defining this way of hunting to the photographic term ""snapshot"". This voice-over reinforces the unhealthy relationship Sy has with photography by making the connection between photography and hunting.The protagonist of the film One Hour Photo Sy Parrish is reminiscent of Norman Bates the protagonist of Alfred Hitchcock's 1960's film Psycho. Both protagonists appear innocently genuine, however they both have unhealthy obsessions. Norman Bates with his mother and Sy with the Yorkin family.The theme of One Hour Photo is voyeurism with Sy Parrish's invasion of people's privacy through viewing their photographs.Another form of visual art that is used to build up suspense in One Hour Photo is the television. An example of this is when Sy is watching an episode of The Simpsons where Homer tells Bart that the person who wants to harm him is probably the person he least expects. This gives the audience an insight into Sy's obsessive and potentially dangerous personality. Another example is when Sy is watching the film The Day the Earth Stood Still, the voice that can be heard is of an alien who explains to the people of the Earth that if they extend their violence to the outside world there will be consequences. This is an effective forecasting devise which gives the audience further insight into Sy Parrish's avenging character.The re-occurring motif throughout the film is photography. The shot composition is carefully chosen by Jeff Cronenweth to symbolise photographs. A good example of this is at the end of the film Sy is sitting in a room seen through a window, the image bordered by the window frame taking the appearance of a photograph. Another scene that visually reinforces the connection between photography and the theme of this film, is where Sy is looking down at a blank sheet of photographic paper, which in my opinion symbolises the emptiness of his life.In creating the creepy character of Sy Parish Robin Williams has once again truly cements his outstanding acting ability.One Hour Photo is a promising debut from Mark Romanek and I look forward to his future projects.7/10",One Hour Photo
307,lumkinsc98,A perfect example of why I truly love film.,8,4 September 2002,"This is not a review of the film, I just wanted to share a couple of thoughts with everyone. First off, you must see this film somehow. It doesn't matter how, just go out and see it somehow! I am simply blown away with it, from top to bottom. The look, the script, the dialogue, and above all else... ...the performance of one Robin Williams. Not only is he IN it, but he gives his best performance ever IMO. Add to that, the fact that he has some of my favorite lines in the entire history of film to work with, and we are really talking. Just hearing him explain and describe pictures, photography, etc... is awesome as hell. This is a total ""must see"", and for him to be deprived of any recognition of this role, and film as a whole, will truly be a misfortune.With a showing like this, it makes one wonder why in the hell he never started doing more ""psycho"" roles until here recently (with this film, and also the recent Insomnia). What Alfred Hitchcock did to the shower in terms of how movie viewers look upon it, Mark Romanek has done to one hour photo places, and clerks.At first thought, a film about a one hour photo place, and clerk could be nothing more than a boring mess. Not here however, it is clever, inventive, and damned chilling. As a matter of fact, this film has a few of the most disturbing scenes I have ever witnessed in the history of my watching film. In short, this is about a one hour photo guy, who obsesses over those individuals who go to him to have their film developed, and it goes from there. I can't truly say much more than that, as to not give away any of the plot. I will say this though... ...have you ever wondered ""what if"" that one hour photo guy made just one more extra set of your photos and kept them for himself? This film, well, it really makes you think, not only about one hour photo stations or clerks, but about photography, and more importantly, life, in a whole new way.",One Hour Photo

It's great when a film can be creepy when nothing except talking and staring at a photo is happening. The film in my opinion though, dragged along at some bits, making it quite boring at times. However, Robin Williams performance made up for it, and the last 25 minutes of the film""SPOILERS""Especially the scene in which the manager of Sav mart gets the photographs of his daughter that Sy has taken in such a way that they are like a flip bookand of course the scene with the husband and his lover in the hotel room..

310,aaron-takhar,A frightening portrait of life on the edge of madness,8,4 January 2012,"Robin Williams's mysterious character creates an unnerving story line which is visually successful in this extremely creepy thriller. The story deals with a theme which is not at all unique but still touched on which is loneliness. Many films show the struggle that the protagonist has to go through; in particular it's is an ideology shared with young men such as Travis Bickle in ""Taxi Driver"" and the nameless narrator in ""Fight Club"". The film draws on how our society is capable of excluding people who are unable to articulate their feelings. Whilst watching it I enjoyed how visually through some of the unusual shots of surreal lighting it managed to captivate me and I was in Seymour Parrish's world. Overall the film was an excellent portrayal of a character that is deeply disturbed and falls further into insanity. The concept is simple, Seymour lives his life and his opinions are made up through the snap shots of others. It shows us how the emptiness in his life is fulfilled by that of others, as in this world it is safe compared to his life. Deep down he knew it was flawed and admitted that when you take photos it is misleading into someone's life as pain is hardly shown. He realises his urban alienation halfway through the film and attempts to rectify the situation which leads to its ending.Moments of the film which make it stand out to other psychological films can be considered as strange or even disturbing; the prime example of this is his dream. Director Mark Romanek cleverly uses the blood out of Sy's (Seymour's) eyes to show the pain he has experienced when he realises the family he observes isn't as perfect as he first thought. The blood is symbolic of how is blinded in pain and confusion, the surreal white glow makes it more haunting. The film in my opinion was also successful because of the performance of Robin Williams. He is underrated as a serious actor and although he has thrived as a comedic actor in ""Mrs Doubtfire"" and ""Good Morning Vietnam"", it is very harsh to overlook his serious performances. In both ""Awakenings"" and ""Insomnia"" he was excellent at supporting two humongous actors in De Niro and Pacino. But in One Hour Photo he is the lead and offers a hauntingly powerful performance and conveys all sorts of emotion in an extremely convincing manner and really should off at least been nominated for an academy award and really should of won it!Mark Romanek creates an extremely uncomfortable portrait of life on the edge of madness. Romanek also wrote this impressive script which doesn't rely on shock value or an obscure out-of-context twist unfitting to time, culture or irrespective to sociological points of view which just attempt to bamboozle the audience, instead like Paul Schrader's amazing script of Taxi Driver it simply presents a more realistic view of life. A bit like Travis Bickle or Trevor Reznik in ""The Machinist"" he has a strong self -destruct mechanism and can be labelled as pathetic at his attempt to articulate to other people and interact with what could be considered as ""normal"" people. This intense drama which at the flaws of the society we live in this extremely captivating tale of loneliness and an in-depth character study of someone who on the edge who is ready to be pushed. Overall it's an immensely powerful drama which can be considered a cult classic and should be watched by any fan of films which tackle more difficult subjects such as observing how society is capable of rejection in Mark Romanek's stunning film.",One Hour Photo
311,sunnysani_88,Subtle but Unsettling,8,9 December 2004,"For a first time movie director(kormanek) he did an amazing job, and to get Robin Williams to star in it, wow. Robin is incredibly pathetic as Sy Parrish, don't get me wrong, that's a compliment. Sy is supposed to be pathetic, he is supposed to make us pity him. What is amazing however, Robin managed to be eerie as well, so he puts us in a spot, we want to sympathies with him, but we cant, not really, because he is so disturbingly scary. It just shows how good an actor, Robin is. The cinematography is great too, the colour combination for example, it's so detailed and it has a dreamlike quality to them.How each scene played out, its beautiful. Kudos to Kormanek. This is different from any other thriller because the 'pyscho' is really humane, we can understand why he did what he did, actually, in the last scene, i just want to go over and hug him, there's this desperation in him, a need to be loved just like any other human being, all this is so subtly shown in the film. The actors didn't say anything particularly revealing. It's just the looks in Sy's eyes, the way he speaks, the body languages, it's so cleverly subtle that's what makes it more disturbing. I thought this film is going to be scary, with lots of gore and blood, i was pleasantly surprised, in fact, i didn't find this movie all that scary at all, it's more unsettling than scary. This movie got me thinking long after it's finished.",One Hour Photo

He does not care about that, but he is the one who has an eye for pictures.. the whole film is made of great pictures and the great acting of Robin Williams just fits in the frame. A little disturbing is the theme from ""American Beauty"" in there, since that music already was used on a very emotional film of the same kind, I can't stop thinking about the Pictures connected to that decent Piano. It takes me away from what I 'd like to keep my eye on. The music totally fits in there, but it was already used. Its like seeing someone familiar talking with a different voice, it distracts and should have really been avoided. Of course, you could say that is the whole trick.. everything is a copy, is a copy, is a copy ....Anyway, there is a close connection to the pictures, and the text, the way these two media go together here is brilliant.

How could the great Robin Williams possibly be in a bad movie?  Well, he's done it this time!The film was dull, very slow and certainly not scary in the slightest (as it is advertised to be).  Not one character impressed me, nor did the photography (of which I always take an interest).

315,statto4ever,A nice development.......,8,17 August 2002,"Sy Parrish (Robin Williams) is the technician at the SavMart photo lab where he has worked for many years. Over time he has gotten to know many of the customers, but none more so than the Yorkin family. But just how far does Sy's obsession run?One Hour Photo is simply a stunning film; it's a tour de force of a movie that is not only a stunning debut movie (80's flick 'Static' not withstanding) from an exciting young director, but also boats a career best performance from Robin Williams.Williams is so convincing as Seymour 'Sy' Parrish that you completely forget that you are watching the man that tortured the movie watching world with the likes of 'Bicentennial Man', 'What Dreams May Come', 'Patch Adams', 'Father's Day', 'Jack', 'Flubber' and 'Mrs. Doubtifre'. But, I digress; it seems vulgar to mention such films in the same breath as this stunning performance. Williams builds on the work he did in Insomnia (which was actually filmed after this film, but you understand what I'm saying, right?) and brings to film history one of the finest portrayals of anonymous danger.Williams Sy is the guy you see every day, but never give more than a passing thought to. But, what if he is giving more than a passing thought to you? What if he has become so obsessed with your family that he starts turning up at your lunch break, or your kid's sports practice? Williams plays Sy perfectly, so ambiguous, so controlled. You're never sure what he's thinking behind those cold, cold eyes. His many voiceovers are delivered with an ice cold matter-of-fact manner that sends a chill down the spine. You're never quite sure what Sy is capable of, Williams never gives anything away and this creates tension from the very first frame. It's tension that continues to build slowly and deliberately throughout the film right up to the final frame. The tension practically drips out of the screen during the scenes where Sy 'bumps' into the various members of the family outside of the SavMart setting, you feel as uncomfortable as the family members, it's impressive stuff. Williams cold ambiguous manner coupled with Romanek's stark visual style leave the viewer unsettled and unsure what to expect next from the film. This certainly no by-the-numbers Hollywood stalker/slasher film, that much is certain.Romanek has teamed up with David Fincher's cinematographer of choice Jeff Cronenweth to produce a visually astounding movie. Although both Fincher and Romenek have a background in music videos, Fincher is a lot flashier than Romanek. Romanek's style is subdued, but stark and barren. The movie is beautifully filmed, with incredible use of light employed, whether it's in the sterile white photolab or the warm home of the Yorkin's. A stunning lighting effect is used in the final moments of the film to ground Sy in one of his earlier voiceovers. It's an incredible moment and one that will live with me for a good while.I look forward to Romaneks next film as after his work here he can now be mentioned in the same breath as the likes of Soderbergh, PT Anderson, Fincher and Nolan as a new hot director to watch out for.
Williams steals this film, but let's not do disservice to the rest of the cast who step up to the plate and give some admirable work. Connie Nielsen is perhaps the best on offer; she works well as the mother of the Yorkin family. I like Michael Vartan in TV show 'Alias' and it's nice to see him in a film, he is given little to do until later in the film, but he handles some difficult scenes well. Dylan Smith has little to do, but be suitably cute as the Yorkin's son.It's always nice to see Gary 'Boss from Hell' Cole and he again plays a boss here. He had better watch out though, or he'll become stereotyped! Also, apparently there is life after ER as Eriq La Salle pops up later in the film and has some impressive scenes with Williams.The supporting players however, are just the lettuce at the side of the cheeseburger that is Robin Williams. I cannot stress how good he is here; it's easily his best work to date, surpassing the likes of 'The World According To Garp', 'Good Will Hunting', 'The Fisher King', 'Dead Poet's Society' and the recent 'Insomnia'. This is an Oscar worthy performance, but I fear that the Academy might shirk at the films dark subject matter and ambiguous nature. The Academy likes easy films, which One Hour Photo is certainly not.In-fact One Hour Photo is a cold, dark, ambiguous film that leaves the viewer unsure of its direction for the entire running time. It asks questions of the viewer constantly and leaves itself burned into the viewers conscience long after the end titles have rolled and the lights have came up.9/10 for One Hour Photo.",One Hour Photo
316,1024,One of 2002's most overlooked films.,10,31 May 2003,"I finally got around to renting this DVD. It was worth the wait. The film at first seems to be a ""Psycho"" remake, but Robin Williams and the director Mark Romanek have crafted a truly beautiful parable of our isolated modern age. ""Sy"" (Seymour- SEE MORE?) is the anti-hero in this film. Perhaps hero is too strong a term, but in a world of directionless yuppie drones who choose to ignore life, he becomes a sort of existential man of action. Is he creepy and disturbed? Yes. But so are all of the blandly ""normal"" characters in the film. ( The young son is an exception to this rule). Most of the TV clips you may have seen really don't reveal the depth of characterization Williiams and Romanek give to Sy. In less capable hands this could have been a horrible film, but all of the characters seem all too human, and well drawn. As a former One Hour Photo employee myself, I can say that they got the working environment 100% on target. There is some very subtle and clever cinematography. Watch for how the tone of color changes to set the mood, to warm yellows when Sy interacts with people, and cold blue-white when he is alone. Even though this is a cinema buff's film, the plot turns and suspense are top notch and will keep you watching until the end; it will also keep you thinking for a good while afterwards.",One Hour Photo

I view hitchcock as most film buffs view Orson Welles.  With that being said, I left the movie theater after viewing One Hour Photo utterly spellbound. The same uneasy (not necessarily nervous) feeling that one experiences during a film like Notorious or North By Northwest can be experienced here.  The audience isn't scared of Williams' character, they're uncomfortable around him, which is just how the other characters in the film view him.  The other great element of the film is that it is easy to follow.  While the trend in the mystery / thriller genre of today is to confuse and disorientate the audience as a means of creating tension, the director takes down a straight road that has several bumps along the way, which provides the same tension without all the confusion (See this film, then watch either Memento or Mulholland Drive).  I can go on and on, but I will leave you with the this as a close to this review.

With something as simple as the life of a guy who works at Sav-Mart (a shop exactly like Wal-Mart), they created a thriller atmosphere.

Before this movie, I never considered the fact that the people at a one hour photo place looked through our lives, saw the places we've been, and the people we've encountered. To me, the thought doesn't make the workers creepy, but their jobs in general feel quite invasive. This film also made me realize that we, as a society, can be very blind to those who we take for granted. For example, Sy the photo guy is clearly obsessed with Nina and her family, yet Nina just sees it as a passion for what he does. She just doesn't notice all the little things Sy does for her. Instead, she simply takes it as quality customer service. Is she naïve, blind, or just uncaring towards this meek, insignificant photo guy?

The main scenes of the movie are constructed like if they were thought for photographic shots. It's not a Tarantino's movie where the characters speaks too much for expressing their inner feelings, in this movie the set speaks for the characters: Emblematic is the scene where Sy is lied down on the bed of the mall alone. He is Alone in a place full of people, how is it possible? It happens because malls are fake places where fake people smile everyday and fake mothers and fathers walk quietly thinking to be happy. Sy is a victim of a commercial society that privileges the image to the communication of the emotions. Sy is alone, he hasn't friends, parents or someone who loves him, he has been spending his time watching the life of the others in the pictures he prints. He is a shlemiel who desires to be happy and loved. His faith in the image pushes him to change its good-natured aspect in cynical but its weapon is not the gun but the camera. Only in this way he thinks to be able to convert the running values and to see recognized its human superiority on the others. But he has forgotten an important thing: In a fake society made by fake people where the simple and pure men are defeated even imagine can be fake!! He is only the reproduction of a fake reality and it is not enough to allow him to conquer the life of his dreams. He was a victim and now he is a monster.",One Hour Photo

The premise of a photo-lab techincian developing an unhealthy relationship with his customers was an intriguing one.  However, this movie was dull, poorly-acted, and boring.  There was not enough background on any of the characters to create sympathy, and Williams' character's behavior was not explained until an astoundingly trite (and insufficient) scene at the end of the film. This left me feeling annoyed and wondering why in the world he was doing all of these things, and why I was expected to care.Overall, the performances were stilted and the dialogue trite.  The supposedly ""shocking"" hotel scene was incredibly lame--I actually laughed as I was watching it.  I couldn't believe what I was seeing, and not because it was ""shocking"" and confrontational, but because it was so stupid and unnecessary.  The grimaces of ""shame"" and ""fear"" on the characters' faces were ridiculous, and Williams' overacting was embarrassing.This is a bad, bad movie.  I just watched it and I've already forgotten most of what I saw. The symbolism was overdone...the entire thing just seemed so contrived.

325,kristy_chan,"Someone Watched ""The Shining"" Too Many Times",8,23 April 2005,"""One Hour Photo"" is a great thriller that unabashedly borrows tactics from Stanley Kubrick's ""The Shining"": the tracking shots, the ""linear"" cinematography, the Black guy who can't wait to help the white family, a sensitive child character, and the overall weirdness. I read in the IMDb trivia that Jack Nicholson was originally asked to play the role of ""Sy"", but that would have made this film into too obvious of a ""Shining"" rip-off. Robin Williams' convincing and compassionate acting as ""Sy"" bent the film in a different direction. He is much more subtle than Nicholson, who we can imagine as being constantly at the boiling point in many of his other roles. Williams delivers a feminized performance, where even his victims, being held at knifepoint can't seem to be dominated by his weak persona.

To watch him in pain hurts the viewer. The theater where I went to see this movie with a friend was completely silent, not a sound--everyone was fully drawn into this film and connected to it. Of course, it's easier to connect to a character who has the opportunity to commit murder but does not, seeking to punish the transgressor, but this doesn't take anything away from Williams--he's simply great, possibly Oscar worthy.

Unfortunately, the delicately creepy premise gets bogged down by the overblown production and the story never really gets off the ground (and ends up suffering from a couple of  huge lapses of logic).  From the beginning of the story's chronology, the movie keeps flashing neon signs that scream ""creepy movie, creepy movie,"" such as the unnecessary and annoying bursts of suspenseful music during early expository scenes that are neither creepy nor suspenseful.  It is as though the director is afraid the audience won't get it, or worse, can't pay attention to the movie long enough to come to that conclusion on their own.

331,foxgirl,Picture perfect.,8,6 October 2004,"The entire time I watched this movie, I felt as though I were looking at an endless series of snapshots. Everything was too perfect and clean, and the colours too crisp and pure, the store too vast and white and gleaming... but not enough to make the surreality of the setting obscure the story. Everything's just this side of reality--just like when, for example, you see the photos of someone that they want to show you, the best ones. None of the ones where their hair is messed-up, their expression silly, their rear shot at an unflattering angle can be found--there's nary a single shot in this masterpiece out of place. As Sy's voice-over says, if you look through a person's photo albums, you might come away with the impression that nothing bad ever happens to them. In addition to including the key colours of photo development and emphasizing Sy's sterile, lonely identity with the whites, beiges and taupes of his environments, we are placed artistically in a world that can only be described as picture-perfect.I could go on about the cinematography, but that's not all I want to rave about. Robin Williams' performance in Insomnia was like a dress rehearsal for this film--as Sy, he gives us even more of a subtle, spare view into an unstable character's world. With each troubled role he takes on, he performs better and better. True aficionados of character acting will not at all be disappointed by this film... and yes, it sounds strange to me, too, to place Robin Williams in that esteemed acting category. He lives up to the praise he has garnered for this movie, and then some.**SPOILERS BELOW**I've read criticisms of the tensions between Mr. and Mrs. Yorkin--they fight over money, but she spends all her time at the discount store, Savmart. I feel that those who espouse this notion are missing some serious subtleties in the Yorkins' relationship--she feels that he has emotionally distanced himself from the family, and he seems to be expressing misplaced frustration with himself and the situation when he argues with her over her spending. Multiple instances in the movie bear out both complaints--we find he is having an affair, and we discover that Mrs. Yorkin has 'some serious shopping to do' during the day at the mall, and is consistently dressed and coiffed like a model, somewhat out of the norm for your average Savmart customer. It's a very realistic fight between a husband and wife about... nothing that they're actually voicing at all.As to whether or not the nude, posed photos were actually ever taken... well, I, for one, am satisfied to be left without that question being definitively answered. Does it matter? Mr. Yorkin and Maya were both duly humiliated, which was part of the purpose of the exercise. Perhaps it's better if he didn't, if he took pictures of random objects in their room, in his own--it would make us even slightly more sympathetic to Sy. But regardless, the ending makes it fairly clear that whatever the reality of it, Sy was acting against the two of them with, as a previous reviewer so eloquently put it, the worst punishment in his world.It's a picture... act like you're enjoying it. Act like you're having fun. And at the end of it, you're left feeling guilty and dirty and ashamed and angry... somewhat like the way the movie lets you feel at the end. I can't tell you how much I enjoy movies that really live up to Traffic's tagline--""No one comes away clean."" Requiem for a Dream was like that, Traffic itself is like that, and One Hour Photo is certainly like that. I think it's a good thing, having been a retail lackey, to have some people realize what it is like to be looked through, to be looked over. And likewise, it's a good thing for others to realize that beautiful people in perfect homes assure their children and themselves that everyone's fine, they have girlfriends and mommies and daddies who love them. Both sets of people could benefit from a viewing of this film, but no one's going to come away with a good and light-hearted feeling when the credits begin to roll.I respect that, in a film.",One Hour Photo
332,dsaliba-1,"Original, well crafted, and well acted",8,4 March 2003,"The first order of business is to declare that Robin Williams' performance is superb. As far as I'm concerned, this is Williams' best work to date. The second order of business is to point out what initially disturbed me as I was viewing the film for the first time. I felt that the pacing in the beginning was rather slow. But after thinking about it and discussing it with another viewer, I have come to the conclusion that the pacing cleverly supports the main character's persona and reinforces (emphasizes) that character's predicament in life. So the pacing (though at first disturbing) works very well.The cinematography in a number of silent scenes is carefully planned and deliberately symbolic (lots of echoings of photography). In some talking scenes there are ""photography"" metaphors and historical expositions. Though interesting, these scenes are sometimes slightly intrusive. But overall, I think they help support the careful character development so central to the plot.The script is well written and carries the plot exquisitely to its ""terrifying"" conclusion. And as it turns out, the reason that the conclusion is so terrifying (Williams' superb acting is a given, of course) is because the pacing, the cinematography, and the metaphors distract the viewer (derail, so to speak) just enough to allow the ending to erupt with such unexpected elegance that the viewer is stunned by the final ""meaning"" -- the truth being told by this fascinating tale.

People just don't get it...This movie is about REAL life, REAL people, and REAL problems...Hollywood has had a bad habbit of sugar coating reality.  All movies have happy endings??? The good guy always win???  Everyone is beautiful???Give me a break.  Hollywood has the tendency of making the bad BAD and the good GOOD.  I think most people are somewhere in the middle. I believe that everyone has a dark side and a good side.  We're always so quick to judge, label, and forget about people.A little advice to people in general, never forget anyone.Powerful film, excellent score (soundtrack).  I recommend this film to all those mature enough to pay attention.",One Hour Photo
334,db_in_uk,Interesting Premise,7,24 June 2003,"The premise of a photo developer becoming emotionally attached to a family through a lifetime of photos is an interesting one, and nicely played out. There is a lot of well thought out moments, albeit fairly obvious - the stark contrast between Sy's bland off-white and light grey world to that of the family which surrounds its moments in colour as an example.  Nothing overly spectacular here, but not all to familiar either, which is refreshing in today's suspense films.  If I had any main criticisms, it is I wish the producers would trust the audience a little more with their own conclusions. We recognise that Sy is nearing the insanity of dillusion, we don't need it spelled out to us in the last shot.  Get rid of the bookends, and the strength of the film increases.",One Hour Photo
335,sacresswell,I liked it,7,1 February 2012,"This film is quite understated all the way through. Robin William's acting ability coupled with the cinematography tells a very tense and emotive story which goes above and beyond what is played out on the screen. I felt drawn in to his character and world.Having said this, there was the odd moment where it all felt a little clichéd but they were few and far between.As with all good films, it has its own special personality, heightened by supermarket colours and camera angles, and an interesting concept at it's base.Worth watching in my opinion.",One Hour Photo
336,woodabby,Almost a masterpiece,9,6 June 2013,"I didn't see this at the movies, I am not a fan of Robin Williams and the trailers didn't appeal, now I regret that. Caught it on TV and was immediately involved.Sadly one reason I was so engaged is i related to the isolation of Sy. The loneliness of people with no family is something few understand.Some of the scenes really capture life of the unconnected. No-one to buy a present for or spend Christmas with, just work, home, work, home ........Of course Sy takes it much farther but hey it's a movie.If you missed this first time around get the DVD but be prepared for a disturbing time.",One Hour Photo
337,mchugh92,The best character portrait since Taxi Driver.,9,12 February 2010,"Robin Williams gives a very good, albeit surprisingly scary performance here. He plays Sy, a very lonely and psychologically damaged man who works as a photo developer at a local chain store, he becomes completely obsessed with what he perceives as the ""perfect family."" Visually, it is simplistic but also striking, there is a hint of hyper-realism in the general look of the film. Robin Williams can give a very good dramatic performance when he is given a good script, but in this film he goes to a completely different level. He literally transforms into Sy, and the result is a weak, although dangerous character who we genuinely feel sorry for.I am not sure if anyone has made this comparison before me, but when I watch this film, it reminds me a little bit of Taxi Driver, both Travis and Sy are lonely, their motivations are completely different of course, but both these films are essentially character portraits that deal with loneliness. The supporting cast give reasonably good performances but Williams truly carries the movie.In closing, this film is far from being the best of all time, but it is a great film nonetheless and I recommend it to people who liked Taxi Driver.",One Hour Photo

To expand on that for those not familiar with the term, it was undoubtedly similar to a heterosexual male getting a sudden and unwanted splash of non identifiable male semen on his lower lip. Not pleasant at all. After seeing some of the reviews which use terms like ' genuinely scary' or 'Williams at his best' I can only conclude that we need more hospital beds. And really really good psychiatrists. To make the ultimate statement, I'd rather watch an N'Sync on tour documentary. Nuff said.",One Hour Photo
339,andyb2300,Excellent psychological thriller,10,17 October 2002,"One Hour Photo highlights Robin Williams in what is certainly one of the most demanding and chilling roles of his career, and he delivers on every level.  Williams plays Seymour, a lonley film developer at a convenience store one hour photo center, who develops a truly unique relationship with some of his customers.  In an effort to escape the void in his life, Seymour ""adopts"" these individuals and engrosses himself in their life through the pictures they bring in.  Williams does an outstanding job in this role by playing a character that you can certainly sympathize with to a point, but whose obsession takes him to edges of sanity and beyond.This is the first film I have seen by director Mark Romanek, however he creates the perfect atmosphere through the eerie lighting in Seymour's home, and the occasional peek into his demented thoughts.  Needless to say I will certainly be looking forward to Romanek's next film.  To avoid giving away too much of the film, I will not disclose any details about the climax, or the surprise ending; however I tell you that this movie will not leave you disappointed",One Hour Photo
340,daveyh25,"A Wonderul Motion ""Picture""!!!",9,9 January 2003,"ONE HOUR PHOTO September 19, 2002 Sy Parrish: Robin Williams Nina Yorkin: Connie Nielsen Will Yorkin: Michael Vartan Bill Owens: Gary Cole Jake Yorkin: Dylan Smith Det. Van Der Zee: Eriq LaSalle Maya Burson: Erin Daniels Fox Searchlight Pictures presents a film written and directed by Mark Romanek. Running time: 98 minutes. Rated R (for sexual content and language).*** Warning: Some Spoilers ***'One-Hour Photo' is a scary movie.  No, it's not your typical scary movie that we are accustomed to seeing on the big screen.  It's scary because the character that we see on film is not so different than most of us. However, he's not quite right . just a little off, so to speak.  He's like a car we drive which has a cracked windshield.  The car still runs fine, but it's not the same, and the vision of the world we see through that glass . is just a bit warped at times.  Robin Williams plays that character, and his name is Sy Parrish.Sy Parrish has worked in the photo shop at the local SavMart, which is your typical discount store.  He loves his job and takes pride in developing the pictures for SavMart's customers. They are not just SavMart's customers . they are HIS customers.One particular customer is a family by the name of Yorkin.  Sy pays particular attention to this family, for he keeps a set of prints of them just for himself.  He imagines himself being a part of that family.  To him, he is `Uncle' Sy.  Sy doesn't appear to have any family or friends of his own . so he pretends to have a life that is more meaningful . more significant.  To most people, he is just another insignificant person we see in our daily lives.  Sy is someone that wants to be accepted and more importantly . loved.  He lives in a fantasy world.  Why is he this way? What has made him a little more 'cracked' than the rest of us?  We don't really have time to think about that as we watch this movie.  And, come to think of it, we don't take the time to think about people like Sy in our own lives either.This movie, superbly directed by Mark Romanek, utilizes the camera in ways that I've not seen before in a motion picture.  In other words, although this is a `motion' picture, the director lets us take a `snapshot' of the world much how our own mind takes in the series of events we see every day.Robin Williams, in perhaps his best role on screen, is not playing his typical role.  Normally, we either see him as a bigger than life character or the typical `Clown'.  In this movie, he is neither of these things. He is a lonely man, a man without a sense of purpose, at least not in the real world.  He is not very funny, but in fact, quite sad.  And, there is nothing more melancholy and gloomy than that of a sad clown.I highly recommend this movie and give it a score of 8.5 on a scale of 1 to 10.David Hardin",One Hour Photo

It is a great art flick with a really strong and interesting plot.",One Hour Photo
342,schinaro,Expected Better,6,20 June 2003,Before I actually sat down to watch this movie I was expecting a Silence Of The Lambs type thriller.  What I got sadly was a great actor giving a fine performance in a weak script.Yes it had originality in parts but basically the ending sucked.I'd buy the soundtrack though!!!6/10,One Hour Photo
343,angry_white_male,Romanek is up and coming,10,8 December 2003,"I loved this movie.  Romanek pays attention to the minute details often overlooked by most directors through the use of natural lighting, exceptional cinemaphotography that gives you a moment to take in the scenery and a soundtrack that doesn't force the viewer to keep fiddling with the volume.  At 90 minutes in length, there is no pointless filler doesn't bore you and irrelevant side plots to push it to the 2-hour mark.  It's a movie you can sit back and enjoy without feeling distracted by ridiculous special effects, jittery camera work or a disjointed plot.  It has a peaceful, deep and thoughtful feel to the narration and dialog that is enhanced and complimented by the soundtrack.  You can identify with the characters because they're not some Hollywood fantasy - but real and identifiable everyday people who react as you would expect everyday people to react.Robin Williams has proven that he's a versatile actor.  I've always liked his characters in comedies (i.e., Mork and Mindy, The Birdcage and Death to Smoochy) - however he really shines in more dramatic roles (Moscow on the Hudson and Awakenings).  His character Sy in One Hour Photo takes him to the next level, but he's not the center of attraction.  This is a good thing. Romanek gives the movie a sense of balance by giving characters depth and dimension.  He makes sure that the perfect family that is the focus of Sy's obsession has problems just like everyone else in spite of their picture perfect affluent lifestyle.  We see that while Sy succeeds at work with a warm, friendly disposition - his personal life is cold and lonely with his surroundings at home the same impersonal and sterile environment at work. Sy's character fits perfectly.Another bright spot in One Hour Photo was Dylan Smith, who played the son of the family that Sy is obsessed with.  He's a natural actor who has the ability to play natural characters - an average kid who does a splendid job of acting as an average kid.  Romanek doesn't insult the viewer by subjecting us to the stereotypical, annoying, mouthy, whiny, know-it-all kid with the bowl haircut that has ruined movie after movie.
If I could change something - I would cast someone other than Gary Cole to play Sy's boss.  Maybe it's the MST3K fan inside me saying this, but after seeing Office Space many times, I kept waiting for him to reincarnate the role of Bill Lumbergh in even the most subtle way, mmmm-kay?.  Romanek knew how not to cross the fine line that separated Cole's role as the sadistic boss in Office Space from boss in One Hour Photo.I give this movie a 9.5 out of 10.",One Hour Photo

345,cro75,Decent Stalker Movie Where Williams Shines,7,1 July 2010,"I was going through the OnDemand movie listings one night, looking for a movie to watch. Under the ""Deranged Thrillers"" section, I found ""One Hour Photo."" I saw Robin Williams as the lead, and immediately I was drawn to watch the movie. After having watched it, I found it to be a decent stalker movie, saved by the acting of Robin Williams.Robin Williams is truly one of the most underrated all-around actors in Hollywood. He always brings intensity and passion to his roles, as evidenced in _Good Will Hunting (1997)_, _Dead Poets Society (1989)_, and even _Insomnia (2002/I)_. As in those, in _One Hour Photo (2002)_, he saves the movie with his intense demeanor, making his character seem more realistic, and much more creepy. The supporting role players weren't bad, but I feel without Robin Williams, this movie would not have the same feel. I would recommend this movie to anybody who enjoy thrillers with the bonus of a great character actor (Robin Williams) playing the deranged lead.Overall, I found it to be a decent thriller, but I give Robin William's performance an A+.7/10",One Hour Photo
346,bear-117,Mark Romanek scores twice!,8,1 September 2002,"It's been often said that a great painting can be judged just as much by the use of space surrounding the central subject as the subject itself. The same analogy can adjusted for cinema. Often it is the judicious use of silence that can carry as much of an impact in a movie as the dialog. ""One Hour Photo"" is such a film. Wearing two hats, that of writer and director, Mark Romanek has enough confidence in the power of his screen play to allow the principle editor (Jeffrey Ford) to set a languid pace to the film and utilize long stretches without chatter. This pace does not hinder the underlying creepiness of the film, on the contrary, the tension packs as slowly and surely as nitrogen in the tissues of a deep sea diver. The central character of the film is Cy Parrish ""Cy, the Camera Guy!"" played with consummate skill by Robin Williams. Parrish is a film developer that works in a one hour photo within a store that could be any Target or Wal-Mart. Having no life of his own and living day to day through the snap shots taken by others, he becomes enamored, and later, obsessed with a neighborhood family who's only contact with him are the photos that they drop off for development. A word here about Mr. Williams. I have never really considered him a good actor. He's played a multitude of roles and in each one you can see small bits of the Robin Williams ""Shtick"" peaking out from under the costume.(Another great example would be Chris Walken. I could watch him read a phone book, but have you ever seen him in a role where you didn't find yourself saying ""Heh, heh.... Christopher Walken... Cool!""?). This movie changed all that. Rarely have I ever seen an actor submerge so completely his public mannerisms and persona. Robin Williams *was* Cy Parrish, the embodiment of the potential evil that can lurk under even the most banal of exteriors. Kudos are also due to Connie Nielson and Michael Vartan, who play the ""twenty something"" couple with son that becomes the unknowing object of Cy Parrish's obsession, as well as to Darrell Hall, the supervising music editor.

I briefly worked at a quick develop photo shop myself, inside a mall, and this film does that type of work, no justice.

370,grahm_cassius,A psychological masterpiece.,9,19 February 2003,"If you were to read the plot ahead of time, you may not even look at this film as potentially good.  That's when you are reminded what makes a film good.  One Hour Photo was done flawlessly.It's the connotative combinations of the film's spaceless occasions that embrace its free place which amazingly chases, again, flawlessness.  One Hour Photo's haunting camerawork and lighting partnership allows the film to dig into the whole of your emotions.  It reminded me even more of the artfully appealing elements of Fight Club as well.  The audio works in such harmony with the film you don't even notice its independence, meaning you rather absorb the film as one ""whole"", disguising its elements through the genius of their intermixing fluidity.  Harmony, period, if you understand.Ultimately, how could you bear not to be captivated into the screen through which you watch this ""soul"", with the enlightment of Robin Williams, whom is often credited for single handedly successing the film with his brilliance. If perfection is not possible, he came as close to it as possible with his acting part as ""Sey"".  Short for ""Seymore"", pronounced as (s-eye), or the more common ""Cy"".  He directly defines a specific type of victim of mentality.  Too ""on the dot"" to even judge positively.  That's it, period.A psychoanalyst, such as myself, would find the movie interesting from a psychological viewpoint.  This defines ""psychological thriller"", as not only does it include chilling elements precisely caught through the the viewers realization of its characters mind state, but it also requires that psychologically aware mind from its viewer(s) in order be most effective. In other words, this is one of those films that actually requires a certain level of intelligence to even be understood.  These are the films which take films to new levels, that set new standards, that raise the level at which filmmakers must be at in order to achieve a certain level of credibility.Is there anything wrong with one-hour photo? Why did I give this film an 9 out of 10, not a 10?  It could easily be considered a 10, yes, a classic and a masterpiece, but that's where the entire concept comes in.  I think a 10 would require a foundation with even more substance, I almost gave this classic an 8 because it was a cameraman at Sav-Mart.  My view is simple, in order to achieve a 10, there could have been a more ""interesting"" concept to work with and from.  That's it.  The film is too close to perfect, it was manipulated perfectly from every aspect, brilliant, but a perfect 10 would have been made up of something more interesting. It's almost an 8 because not many will find a delicately smiling cameraman at the photo counter in Walgreens too captivating.  They will, however be caught and never let go of by everything you can do right and everything they never even knew you could do beautifully in a film.I would recommend this film in an instant to anyone who loves psychological thrillers, and I think next to anyone will be haunted by ""Sey"" the too nice guy's smiling eyebrows, not to mention their camera.  This is the end of snapshots.",One Hour Photo

373,davidpiedrahita,Surprisingly Effective and extremely good acting!,7,5 August 2003,"One of this years great surprises was 'One Hour Photo'. A combination of beautiful acting by every single person to detail the disturbing story of a guy who processes photographic images for a family. You are told through the eyes of Sy, who takes extra caution in developing pictures for a family he has admired for years, the 'Yorkins'.A disturbing story that trancends into a moral plot within the final stages. The directing was very very impressive and the plot change was very good, but it did not seem dramatic enough to intitle it as a thriller. Everyone at first has a notion of a troubled guy who wants to harm the family but as it progresses you see a totally different side to 'Photo Guy' Sy.This movie is definitely worth a viewing, Robin Williams acting is incredible with the moral story within being an important lesson that we all usually, at some point in our lives take for granted.7/10",One Hour Photo

376,alanrthompson,An excellent movie that leaves you thinking,8,28 July 2007,I was drawn to one hour photo simply because i saw Robin Williams name under it in the TV guide. After watching this movie I was amazed at Williams performance and the sheer depth of this film. Sy Perish (played by Williams) is a lonely photo finisher who secretly takes a certain families photos and pretending that they are his family. This film is not particularly easy to watch but keeps you drawn to it until the end. Robin Williams was excellent in this role proving that he's not just a one trick pony and has very impressive acting skills that make the film all the more believable and enjoyable. As you watch his character throughout the film you don't know what to feel for him. Sad or Sick.,One Hour Photo

Shortly thereafter, the cops are looking for him knowing he might be dangerous.  Why didn't he just go after the husband and his mistress without the threat to the boss?  I guess it was needed to make the story work to its ending.2) Williams' character has been keeping prints of this family for nine years, yet it's just determined after this amount of time has elapsed that the count on the photo machine is off?  You've got to be kidding!!!  Again, his firing was needed to make the story work to its ending.I'll post more when I have more time.....",One Hour Photo
378,Fezster,"Robin Williams gives an awe-inspiring performance,fantastic direction",9,21 August 2002,"This film is definitely on my top 10 list for this year, maybe even all time. Robin Williams plays his character so subtley and controlled that it freaks the hell out of you yet demands sympathy from the viewer. You can't help but feel sorry for his character (Sy) and how he is so disconnected from the rest of the world. Also *possible spoiler ahead* his confession at the end with the police officer and the apartment scene were particularly chilling and disturbing. I also thought the musical score was excellent. I'm not entirely sure who wrote it but it suits the mood perfectly. Try to listen as the score swells up at the near end of the movie. That part just gave me goosebumps. This is by far Robin Williams' greatest performance EVER. This proves that Williams is not only a comic genius, but he can act as well. You totally forget that you are watching Williams on screen most of the time. In conclusion, do yourself a favour, and watch this film. I doubt it will do good at the box office but I really hope it gets nominations particularly the Oscars but you know how they are with comedians turning serious (Jim Carrey anyone?). But I warn you this film is not for the weak at heart nor mind. It grabs your mind and doesn't let go. It will leave you thinking long after you leave the movie theatre.",One Hour Photo

The movie does an amazing job of pushing a feeling on you. In parts you just feel uncomfortable watching and creeped out, just wanted to yell, STOP BEING SO WEIRD. The shots the lighting the acting and the music add together to make you get this strong feeling, feeling exactly what the movie wants you to feel when it wants you to feel that way. That being an important part of a movie it does a perfect job, the movie also left me with a kinda ""memento"" aftermath feeling after I was done watching it. Leaving me to think about what I had just saw like the movie memento did, thuo probably less strong of a feeling. It gave me that puzzle piece falling together conclusion by the end you just thought about all the little details that all added up it was perfect, like a thousand threads making a perfect piece of cloth. It gave me the same aftermath feel as memento but didn't give me the constant headache memento did through out it, considering the movie was all backwards.

The plot has so many holes in it I find it amazing that it got any good reviews.One example: ""Sy"" finds the pictures of the cheating husband, with his girlfriend.  These look like candid shots of the both of them frolicking, kissing (or rather, about to kiss), hugging, etc. Who took these candid shots?  Did they stop a stranger in the street? ""Excuse me sir, could you take a picture of us just as we are about to kiss?""Another example, just for good measure: the police go to the hotel where they believe there might be some foul play taking place.  There are two rooms, Sy's room and the cheating couple's room.  The police first goes to Sy's room to find it empty and only then, to the other room.  Why do they not first go to the room where something awful might be happening?  or, better yet...  Why not send agents to *both* rooms, just in case?I could go on and on and on but, like the movie, it'd be to tedious.",One Hour Photo

385,AskaLangly,Comparing One Hour Photo with Evangelion...,10,24 August 2007,"""One Hour Photo"" has something to deal with depression and some sexuality in it. However, this movie has one thing in relation to it, the animé ""Neon Genesis Evangelion"".So, you see Jake wanting a toy he wanted: a Mass-Produced EVA. Sy states to Jake that he's one of the ""good guys"", however, in the movie ""End of Evangelion"", they are really not.Sy, I'm guessing, is suffering from depression during this movie, and therefore is in some relation to Evangelion's Shinji Ikari (in which GAINAX's Hideaki Anno had suffered, therefore creating an animé with the main character with depression).Also in this movie, we see Sy resting and having a dream with endless shelves... eventually a scary sight with the eyes bleeding profusely. Then seconds later, the Mass-Produced EVA is standing on a nightstand. Think of ""End of Evangelion"", where Asuka Langley gets speared with the ""Spear of Longinus"" into her EVA's left eye, where she feels the pain. This spear, before transforming into Longinus (which the real one is on the Moon), was the weapon that the action figure has in hand, therefore the action figure is truly a bad guy, not a good guy.As Williams said in the commentary on the DVD, Evangelion is one of his most favorite animé... and the figure is one of his own from his personal collection.For being an EVA and Williams fan, this gets some serious attention and thought. 10/10 I give it.",One Hour Photo

There is no clichéd treatment to the film and this is what makes it timeless. The story unfolds deliberately and with a high sense of craft.

394,vinnymac,Williams shows us that he is one of the best in Hollywood.,9,14 September 2002,"My favorite thing about this film was the fact that the lead character Seymour Parrish, played by Williams, was not as black and white (no pun intended) as many of these so called 'psychos' we see in these thrillers popping up all over the place.  We understood and are as the film rolls to a close made to understand what has driven this man and how, given his life, we may make the same choices he has made.  I found it very disturbing to find myself identifying with this man and yet feeling so very far from him. This falls heavily on excellent writing, but could not have been possible without the stellar performance of Oscar Award winning actor Robin Williams.This films release falls very close to the release of Robin Williams' latest stand-up comedy special on HBO.  It's amazing to see this man transform himself from the insane comic to this brilliantly played character.  It does nothing but reassure us, the audience, that Mr. Williams is not only one of the greatest actors of our time, but maybe one of the finest ever.  This is not to deny the well-played performances of the supporting cast.  The ever beautiful and sexy, Connie Nielsen portrays the ever-loving mother, who even in the face of tragedy will never do anything to break up her family. Also, at times it is hard to remember that young Dylan Smith is an actor and not a young boy thrust into this situation.  My applause goes out to the cast of this motion picture.However, a film cannot survive on it's cast alone.  My hat goes off to director Mark Romanek.  A fan of Romanek's work as a music video director (particularly his work with Trent Reznor of Nine Inch Nails) I was simply blown away by his full length picture debut.  I was very impressed with the use of the RGB.  Anyone who knows any thing about the production of photography knows that the colors are done in levels of Red Green and Blue. The way these three colors are schemed throughout the fill was utterly brilliant.  Camera use and cinematography also help capture the surreal and horrifying reality of this film.I was also very found off the soundtrack.  Its simplicity gave the film the perfect feel.  If you look at the track from start to finish, you'll realize that the entire score is one huge build from start to finish.  It really pushes you toward what's coming next, which is what the thriller is all about.Overall I give it a 9 out of 10.  And if you know me, nobody ever gets a 10.",One Hour Photo

It is an unthrilling ""thriller."" And I suspect the ""R"" rating was purposely derived by a few stupid scenes and remarks.Also, I barely could stay awake.

Well, I must say that this movie was very dissapointing. It seemed to drag on and on...and I don't mean that this is a character-driven movie...it is just plain BORING. Nothing seems to happen. By the end of the film, I didn't really care what happened to the main characters (neither did half of the audience in the particular showing I saw, who got up and left before the movie was even over.)

I remember seeing one review for this movie where the person said that the family in the movie wasn't focused on enough to have too much sympathy for them. I disagree; I think the family is focused on about as much as Sy himself. The overall feeling I got from this movie was extremely similar to the one I got after watching Requiem For A Dream. I really didn't know how to feel. I didn't know which characters to feel pity for and which to not. The reason for feeling this way was because the movie was extremely disturbing - I mean, just to think that someone like this could be out there. It doesn't have to be someone developing your photos. It could be a child's teacher or even a close friend. The reviewer who stated that this film would do for photos what Psycho did for showers was correct.

400,ihaveabigrick,I sincerely enjoyed this film,7,27 January 2003,"One Hour Photo is a film of supreme caliber. The film is powered by the haunting, chilling, silencing, and above all-genius performance by Robin Williams. But the rather extraordinary thing is that it is not Robin Williams on the screen, it's Sy Parish (the character's name). Robin Williams fades away from our senses and slips into the ever so sweet and innocent yet psychotic role of a supermarket's photo developer. The films script is only accented by Williams, at times, restrained performance. Williams ignites on the screen and burns till the last frame, and you are unable to take your eyes off him. As I mentioned the film is subliminily written as well as directed. Though being Romanek's first, I certainly don't think this is a bad start. Romanek's direction adds to the on-going tension throughout the film. More affecting is Williams' delightful calmness. Trying to hold himself in becomes more troublesome for both Williams and his character as the story develops. Yet through the calm eyes of an innocent blaze the fires of hatred and intensity, which could very well sum up Williams' performance. The film does have some disturbing images as well. Yet they are not really strong enough for you to get up from your seat and leave yet rather the opposite. Williams' contribution as well as guidance towards the actions and scenes of peril compell as well as amaze you towards both the performance and film itself. Williams' shocking contribution to the screen is enough to make you cry, scream, and yell in your seat. Because the origins of the character are bittersweet just like own known Williams, leads to a crazed and psychotic breakdown. It's as if watching our own funny and beloved Robin fail us. Though the truth could not be any further, Williams but succeeds in the art of acting, creating an achievement in the field. Creating a landmark. Writing his/its own chapter. I guarantee that this film will be required study material in acting classes for now on. In conclusion: definitely one of the best of 2002.",One Hour Photo

The film has been compared to Taxi Driver and I definitely see that comparison, but OHP I felt was much tooderivative of and less compelling than psychological thrillers like Taxi Driver, Full Metal Jacket, et al.

And I wish I had taken this lack of recommendation or appraisal as an indicator. I did not particularly enjoy this film. It looked clean, had some fine composition, and stylistically it had potential, but the characters were flat. They came off as two dimensional as the Ikea catalog they seemed to be taken from.

Time and again he surprises with these brilliant performances that are difficult to fathom considering his humble beginning in sit-com TV and this is some of his very best work.Unfortunately, much of the rest that makes up the film doesn't rise to William's caliber and the end result is diminished because of it. Questionable story line (though a good concept and initial setup), weak supporting cast and non-existent (supporting) character development conspire against what would have otherwise been a 'Best Of' class film.Overall, definitely worth seeing, but without Robin Williams this would have been a B-movie relegated to the teen market and never mentioned again.",One Hour Photo

His Sy Parrish gives me the creeps – from that moment Connie Nielson's Nina Yorkin walks into his One-Hour Photo shop. Williams provides more creeps here than he did in Insomnia. Just take a look at the light thinning crew-cut hair on this bespectacled middle-aged man with the stone-cold, mousy looking eyes and very disturbing smile. He reminds me of a weird and twisted mind with many faces. Just observe Parrish's behavior and it'd be hardly impossible not to be afraid of him. Oh yes, the viewer will get to know his character – slowly and gradually, feeling the tease; wondering what he'd do next. It's his deceiving appearance that truly petrifies an ordinary guy who seems so ordinary to some, yet turns out to be a low-keyed 'psychopath'. Yuks - that's exactly how I feel, studying him and his moves! The moments are very intense and scary. Look out for hints to Parrish's traumatic experiences because they help to connect the events and explain his fantasies and 'schizophrenic' wackiness. You truly have got to compare Michael Vartan's Will character to Gary Cole's Bill Owens. Maybe that too will help you accept the ending of the story.",One Hour Photo

All elements to a good thriller were there, but Romanek seems to have lost inspiration half way to the end, or was he frightened by Robin William's character dimension? This is likely to be one those cases the creature threatens the creator thus forcing creator to cut its life short due to utter lack of handling a character with a life of its own. Needless to say Mr.Williams is able to conceive unthinkable countless different types, but in this first ground-breaking close to real psycho, he definitely stands on the edge of giving birth to an unlimited ever-disturbing classic social misfit ready to be displayed in the vast gallery of top psychos created by cinema along its history, by delivering a performance that outgrows Romanek's capacity to direct such complex performance. That's when he notices the character has to be let well enough alone; otherwise he is bound to demand much more from what the director had thought of.I was surely sold, up to the first half of the movie.

407,CoverD,Pretty believable,7,26 April 2005,"I saw this movie both in theaters and on DVD, and I found it to be very entertaining both times. Not only does Robin Williams do a wonderful job at portraying the lovable, yet psychotic Sy Parrish, but he also makes the story so eerily believable that it is scary. The way in which Sy stalks the family throughout the film is downright disturbing, and something that you wouldn't expect from the cheerful clerk at the beginning of the film. All in all, I found this movie very interesting and I enjoyed it very much. Even when you find out what type of a sick freak Sy really is at the end of the film, you still feel sorry for him. I strongly recommend this movie to anyone looking for a good thriller, or a movie in which Robin Williams strays from his comedic style. 10/10 for me",One Hour Photo
408,samclarke531,"boring, linear plot with inadequate climax and unsatisfying ""twist""",4,3 June 2006,"I just watched this movie and simply wanted to comment on how boring and linear this narrative is. I don't know how many script edits this went through but it deserved a few more in my opinion. The so-called twist at the end of the film is unsatisfying as it fails to properly re-contextualise what has gone before; instead it merely throws in some back story that provides a deeper psychological motive for his actions. There is no gradual culmination of threat/suspense to engage the audience, rather the narrative progresses almost immediately from the inciting incident (protagonist loses his job) to his initial act of retribution (threatening photos of his bosses kid in the park) to his final act of ""mania"" in which he forces an errant father of a picture perfect American family to engage in a mildly degrading photo shoot (at knife-point) with his second, illegitimate lover. Then he is arrested and confesses to having been abused as a child. I felt this climax (the revenge photo shoot for the fathers infidelity, which we learn retrospectively to reflect his experiences as an abused child) should have been stronger. It wasn't dark or inventive enough to illicit any real emotional reaction - in me at least - and centres around the two characters who have been developed least (consequently, we care about them less). Nothing really culminates in this scene that has been adequately seeded earlier in the movie and fails to take one by surprise. We know he's gonna do something ""dark"" from the first act. When it finally happens it is over in minutes and fails to subvert any expectations the writer may have chosen to inculcate in his audience. Robin William's performance is alright - it ain't that demanding a role for the guy to be honest. I.e. it doesn't require anything from him as an actor that we haven't seen him do before. Over-all, its a bit of a plain Jane of a movie. zzzzzzzzzzz",One Hour Photo

But this was a great movie i recommend it it isn't quite up there with Hitchcock but its on its way. Better than insomnia in my mind. a very deep movie with a sterling performance by Williams.

412,ebbixx,"A stunning, sympathetic portrait of a damaged man and the forces that tend to make such men",10,8 September 2002,"No, ""One Hour Photo"" is not for the faint of heart. Nor is it a movie to see if all you want is the escapism the movies so often offer us. For those who want that, there are no shortage of other movies out there, and good ones in their own right.Robin Williams characterization of ""Sy, the Photo Guy"" is wonderful, one of his best, a chilling, humanizing and many-layered portrait of a deeply disturbed individual. What struck me most in watching the performance was the tug-of-war in my own mind about his questionable sanity and his motives. While it's extremely clear from the start that he suffers some significant psychopathology, the ending leaves one wondering (at least a little) about the method madness, and whether it is he that is sick, or human society in the 21st century. We've come quite far from the use of psychopathology as a plot driver since such movies as DePalma's ""Dressed to Kill.""I don't wish to include any spoilers here.  Suffice it to say that by the end I felt that where Seymour went wrong (aside from his obsession) was in having motives that in a sense were a little too good, too moralistic, too rigid... but for reasons that the film ultimately justifies, without excusing or judging. I could see virtually nothing in the writing that was gratuitous or unearned, even if the situations did become rather extreme. Each character remained believable, and even those one was set up to dislike, such as Sy's boss (Gary Cole) were neither presented as saints nor absolute demons, but merely as flawed human beings with motives and drives that sometimes contributed to the unfortunate chain of events that are the throughline of the movie.Rather than demonize Sy, the central character, those who made this work bring us into Sy's mind in a way that is quite certain to be deeply discomfiting to many, but with a compassion and honesty that is only rarely achieved these days (or at any time in the past) in the movies.The screenwriter-director, Mark Romanek, is a talent I hope will go on to greater public appreciation with time, but whether that happens or not, may his projects always find a green light somewhere. He has only directed one other feature film I'm aware of, STATIC, which seems nearly impossible to find on video. The rest of his work, as is so often the case with visually stunning directors, has been in music video, including videos for Madonna and Nine Inch Nails.If I could find fault with anything about the movie it would be in the marketing. Where Romanek and Williams make Sy appear as a deeply flawed (and deeply disturbed) human being, he is clearly presented utmost as a sympathetic character.  This is quite a feat in an era where paranoia is rampant, especially when it comes to ""stalkers"" and the mentally disturbed. Yet the marketing campaign seems to present the simplistic cliche of the creepy stalker, emphasizing only the monstrous aspects of his nature.
I've noted in reviews here and elsewhere a certain polarization of opinion surrounding this film. Perhaps some of those who disliked the film were drawn in by the promises made in posters and ads, and felt cheated (or confused) that this was not the one-dimensional suspense thriller that marketing tried to sell it as?",One Hour Photo
413,Mr_Moviebuff,View this movie as if it were a piece of art...,8,3 December 2002,"Of all the films I've seen at the theater this year, One Hour Photo has been one of the finest.  Its production has taken years, giving Mark Romanek plenty of time to tweak his magnum opus to a searing perfection.  There are little clues of foreshadowing, that you'll miss, if you don't pay close attention to the film.  Robin William's acting is so vivid and convincing that it's hard to believe he once portrayed the flamboyant Mrs. Doubtfire. And the excellent use of colors, lighting and editing to convey emotions, is almost identical to the masterful cinematography of American Beauty.I must admit I wasn't thrilled about seeing a movie about an obsessive stalker, but to enjoy and appreciate this film, one doesn't have to like its subject matter.  When my mother asked me if she would like it, I said, `View this movie as if it were a piece of art.'  If you like a painting, you're going to like how it looks and makes you feel.

Yes, it is conspicuously disturbing and probably should be filed under the same classification that contains Full Metal Jacket and A Clockwork Orange and consequently is rightly rated R.  That said, for the right audience, it delves into the quandary oft pondered, Where does categorical love cease and morph into destructive psychological illness?  Furthermore, focus on the plight of the lonely white lower-middle class worker who feels that society (read special interests and the government) neglects him but chooses to forgo complaining. Probably the the most potent element to the film is that it is quite realistic.  The acting, script, and plot stand muster.  9/10.",One Hour Photo

The whole movie I didn't know whether he should get caught, or he should get away with everything. I recently saw Insomnia and thought it was the best Williams I had every seen or ever will see.

420,rehj,One Hour Photo delivers in the end.,8,19 January 2002,"One Hour Photo is a thriller of a different sort. While the buzz is about Robin Williams taking on a dark, malevolant role, the substance is a unexpectedly honest look into the mind of a stalker who perceives himself as anything but.Mark Romanek puts the audience through a variety of paces, forcing us to re-evaluate our opinion about Seymour (Sy) Parrish throughout. Williams performance transcends himself, and allows the viewer to forget who the actor is and focus on the story within the first 1/2 hour. He is uncharacteristically subdued, and often leaves you wishing for more animation and insight, though this is obviously deliberate, and ultimately a boon to the film.The story develops around Sy's peripheral involvement in Nina (Connie Nielsen) and Will (Michael Vartan) Yorkin's and their son's life, via years of developing their family photos. Sy quietly adopts the Yorkin's as his own family, but what starts as a benign fixation is slowly revealed as much more, in remarkably subtle, but twisted examples. While we are immediately told that Sy has done something wrong at the beginning of the film, Romanek leads us on a red-herring filled chase to the end.Nielsen gives a realistic portrayal of an unhappy housewife in a financially successful marriage, though Vartan comes off paper thin throughout, particularly in a rather stilted marital tiff designed to clue us in on the state of the Yorkin's life. The son, uncredited here, provides the biggest dramatic peril, as he immediately connects with the viewer, but ultimately his competition for screentime with his mother blunts the emotional impact intended.Romanek's unique approach to staging, color choice, and costuming all lend to a surreal view into his characters everyday life. While his approach to symbolism can be heavy handed at times, at others it is equally subtle, and effective in either case.Despite these shortcomings, One Hour Photo delivers in the end, leading to a stunning climax uncommon in today's Hollywood fare. One Hour Photo is a leap into a new approach in audience manipulation, character insight, and selective plot development. A strong effort, that may come up lacking in box office success, but will certainly find its audience in video sales, and overseas distribution.",One Hour Photo
421,cataclysm1071,16 years later...,8,10 August 2018,"I'm writing this review 16 years after the film was released, however the message that the film conveys is still very relevant today. Personal cameras using film and dropping the film somewhere to be developed, had largely been abandoned for camera phones, and other digital devices. The late Robin Williams plays Seymour ""Sy"" Parrish, a lonely but friendly photo counter clerk at a Walmart type big box store. He slowly becomes obsessed with a young, seemingly ""picture perfect"" family whose personal family photos he develops. One day Sy runs into the husband, Will, who's shopping at the savmart, and Sy approaches him with the awe and excitement one may have, had they met their favorite celebrity in public. This display showcases the obsession Sy has with this family, and is almost disturbing in nature.The message conveyed is of the grass is always greener....or things and other people who look good on paper, or in this case, film...isn't always the case. Today in the age of Facebook and other social media, we're all vouyers in a sense, peeping in on other's lives, that appear carefree, fun, exciting and flawless. Robin Williams voice narration summed up this trend perfectly, that NO ONE photographs or records the mundane or painful parts of their life, we the onlookers only see the good. Ironically, it is a very painful and negative situation taking place when someone takes what may have been one of the few photos ever taken of Sy...his jailhouse mugshots.My only nitpicks are a couple of scenes in the movie that never would happened in real life. One is when Sy is watching the little boy Jake's soccer practice. The coach probably saw this strange man lurking around the playground, yet still allows Jake to wander off with him after practice. Even though Jake reassured his coach that Sy was harmless, I still don't see that happening ever. The other nitpick, is that Nina Yorkin appeared somewhat uneasy with Sy's over friendly, somewhat creepy nature when she ran into him at the mall (he was actually following her around), and his over enthusiasm over her family photos....yet she continued to use his photo counter even though there were probably thousands of other film developing places in town.Overall, a great character study of a slowly unraveling man.",One Hour Photo

For those who like comparisons, let say that Kubrick (Shining) & Antonioni (The Eclipse,Blow-up)for instance, could be somewhere in the director's mind... More can be added... Romanek signed here a very different american film, the kind I like most; intelligent, thoughtful, without all the usual childish plot and directing.

Robin Williams plays a delightful character who cracks after having what he would consider a horrible day.

But finally I so wished to experience a potentially good film that I went risking the following nightmares. I will not have any. I made a mistake but for an entirely different reason. The film was so empty and boring that it simply shouldn't have been spent money on (not only my buying a ticket but on producing it). It is only the performance from Robin Williams (Sy, the photo guy) that gave something to watch, as a study in acting, perhaps, but the script is so shallow and hollow that it hurts. What bothers me most is that this film has a certain so-called ""arty"" approach, overly simple script, pretentious direction and photography among others. It strives to be subtle and but it is affected, has no strength and no depth. I have seen enough good and bad European films to recognize it immediately. There is the classic approach: ""show and don't tell"" which has been clearly not heard by Romanek or simply overlooked. He should try much harder or not at all.",One Hour Photo

As in this movie Robin Williams perfectly transforms into a man who is visibly VERY LONELY. Lonely the way a man just can be on planet Earth. Yes, the whole movie was built on his loneliness I know. But it is amazing to watch someone, an actor to act perfectly like the loneliest human being in the world. Because he moves he talks he cries he walks he turns the way that one can instantly recognize someone in his neighborhood. The loneliest one. And it was so heartbreaking that I could hardly bear it. I grew up in a big, loving family, in a family he is only yearning for. And I can not help him and any other people like him. How sad.

Not only is it slow, it is beige.  Very, very beige.  Yes, we do know that there is a point to that, but it is a very obvious point.  In the first three minutes, you'll get all the symbolism, and then spend the rest of this movie waiting for some colour.  The director/ writer has to realize that basing an entire movie around a boring character will likely lead to a boring movie.  Only see it if you have a strong affinity for beige, wear adult running shoes with velcro, or go to baskin robbins and order vanilla ice cream.  Not french vanilla, just vanilla.  If this applies to you... go out and see this movie.  I feel very sorry for you.  If not, there is only one part of the movie you'll enjoy - the blood eyes.

430,mwheat2,Psychological/intellectual thriller: not for the impulse driven mind,10,14 September 2002,"____________________________________________________________________________ ____________________________________________________________________I read up on this movie at this site yesterday, but went to see it today. NOW I understand why some viewers were disappointed. I DEFINITELY WAS NOT!!! THIS WAS AN OUTSTANDING MOVIE!! The telescoping symbols in OHP tell a consistent, subtextual story that has the viewer 'put the pieces together.'  The writer/director, I believe intentionally eliminated outright, 'right-foot,left-foot' lame tell all storytelling, but allowed the viewer to assemble the information cumulatively.  This is a rare intelligent psychological thriller--like The Talented Mr. Rippley--only not so dark.Telescoping examples:   RW character is exemplified in the shot of the pet hamster, running as fast as he could in the exercise wheel.  Hamster lived within the given confines, and responded  with reflexive normalcy.
Meaning:  Sy is a person living the caged and kept 'hamster's life'.  He waits for the caretaker to feed him (Sy feeds hamster/Savmore feeds Sy).
The cage is Sy's knowlege and practice of confining animal expression wanting to get out, but not knowing how.The wheel is a telescoping metaphore for daily activities of life; whether the hamster goes fast, or slow, he does not go anywhere or exceed the boundaries of the cage.The 'eye' is a symbol for ultimately individual perceptual subjectivity in life.  Life is as we see it is.Some examples: photography as life sustaining, medical corneal lecture at hotel, the blood from Sy's eye in his mind, the argument in the store (3+ blue miscalibration)Meaning: a telescoping hint that Sy is highly influenced by the [eye's] information. He built his life around flat visuals--the pictures--and 'all was well' perception.  The perception was again put forward when after being fired, Sy turns up a photo on the floor and it is blank.  This is as far as the director went in [obviously] putting out the key his symbols for examination.I study movies for symbolic content--and HIGHLY RECOMMEND this one.  Robin Williams is an outstanding actor--and proved it here.  Anyone else ""do metaphors""??",One Hour Photo

433,jeffdr,Great film - for some,10,20 September 2002,"This is not a movie that everyone will enjoy, but I think most people will like it if they don't have the wrong expectations.  This is not an ACTION film!!!!  There is very little 'action' in the literal sense and you should not go into the theatre expecting it, or you will be disappointed.  Many people complain that the film doesn't have as much action or violence as they expected, when the problem was that they were expecting any at all.  I would even go so far as to object to the 'thriller' label... much of the movie is not 'thrilling' but rather suspenseful and sad.There are 3 emotions on prominent display here, and Williams portrays them both very well: loneliness, sadness and anger. Throughout the course of the movie we watch Sy progress through these three states, and it is such a natural progression that it alone is what makes the film stand out.  Williams does an EXCEPTIONAL job in this role, which is fortunate because he gets most of the screen time.  People who didn't like his performance I think misread the role.  He does not (nor is he supposed to) have a crazy serial killer personality.  He is a repressed man - that is the reason for his sometimes stifled actions and emotions. I could picture myself in his shoes easily, and I didn't find myself yelling 'No don't do that you idiot!' at the screen as I am often known to do.  Audience members are able to closely identify with his emotions and that is what creates the suspense - because you know what you might think of doing if you were him - and these possibilities are unpleasant.  When you see Sy begin to act these things out it is really uncomfortable.A few more brief things I should mention..  the ending is NOT anti-climatic, when you consider the rest of the film and the character. The photography is quite good (no pun intended), and the music fits very well (sorry, didn't see the similarity to American Beauty...).  As long as you dont have a short attention span and are not expecting the wrong things I think you will greatly enjoy this film.   I give it a strong recommendation.  Grade: A",One Hour Photo

Of the six of us that saw the movie, one person thought it was ""OK"", the rest of us couldn't believe how badly it STANK (and these were people that got to see it for free!)  There was no suspense, no horror, & no drama.  Just Robin Williams with bleached blond hair and a very weak plot.  I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone (in the theater or on video) unless you want to waste an hour and a half of your life that you'll never get back!",One Hour Photo
440,willis80,ok whatever,2,5 October 2002,"I like many types of movies.  What i paid good money for last night was awful.  The actors did a fine job, that's not my beef.  if this movie was an ""emotional rollercoaster"" then it was one without twists, turns, flips or even a slight turn.  the only thing this movie offered this movie-goer besides a display of acting was an unexpected ending, not a shocking one, just unexpected.  it leaves this movie-goer saying, ""okay, whatever"".",One Hour Photo
441,trust113,"Boring, predictable",3,6 October 2002,"The film was put together OK, but it really was too slow.  So much more could have been put in here.  Robin Williams could have been stranger, or been strange in a more interesting way.  I really don't understand how the film has been rated so highly.",One Hour Photo
442,dralston,Weak as water!,3,3 March 2003,"This is an overrated, highly predictable and heavy handed, boring picture. Yes Williams gives a good performance, but the plot and directing are mediocre at best.  There is virtually a neon sign flashing ""Foreshadowing"" across the screen at every turn.",One Hour Photo
443,MTP2003,The best movie I've seen,10,5 April 2003,"One Hour Photo is the best movie I have ever seen. There's no way to describe it--the only thing I can say is that it is the story I've been trying to write for the past two years...maybe not in storyline, but in general feel, photography, and dark, yet whimsically sarcastic and unknowingly-insane narration.The way that Sy narrates, in a way that he thinks he is normal and stable, is amazing--I love films that play on that (like A Clockwork Orange and Flowers for Algernon, although the latter is an innocent form of mental instability)But the way that Mark Romanek portrays the fine line between good and evil is what really makes the movie sing. Although Sy is the good guy in it all, he still holds an immensely creepy and Norman Bates-esque air about him and his actions. The concept of voyeurism and how far it can go is contrasted perfectly with the juxtaposed notion of being the protagonistic hero who does the right thing--but which one has a greater weight in the scheme of morality?god bless movies that have double meanings!And the photography is simply stunning in approach, as well--such as the slightly off centering of some scenes and the subtle yet noticeable change in camera color filters which correspond to the colors used in the color photography process.just see it, that's all...just go and rent it, buy it, whatever.",One Hour Photo
444,guy_23,Great Movie!,10,15 December 2002,"I loved this movie! Just loved it. If you think the Robin Williams is a great comedian - wait till you see this... if he keeps this way he will certainly win an Oscar.This movie really makes you think, and you will keep on thinking long after you return the DVD back to the store.",One Hour Photo
445,rgallavan,A film worthy to be mentioned with Hitchcock's greatest,10,1 March 2003,"This is a film Hitchcock would have been proud to call his own.
One user commented that this film was ""so-so"" due to the fact that the Yorkins weren't given much depth.  Well, this film isn't about the Yorkins. It's how one troubled man sees the Yorkins and how he sees himself with them.The scariest part about this movie, is that we all know someone like Sy. We've met someone at the photo lab or laundromat like Sy.  Hitchcock took ordinary people and the circumstances they live in and made them suspenseful.  Mark Romanek has done the same and met the bar Hitchcock set.Williams deserves an Oscar for this film, but we already know he won't get it.  The powers that be and their politics have already determined that Williams has won his one Oscar and that's all he's entilted to because ""he's not really an actor.""   Romanek at least deserved a screenplay nomination, but damn it, all the man has done is music videos so there is no way in hell we'd give him a nod on his first try.Kudos to Jeff Cronenweth.  His cinematography was beautiful, but alas, he won't get the nod for the same reasons as Romanek.As a side note, Romanek obviously spent some time in a Wal-Mart, or knew someone who did.  As a former employee (God help me) I could only laugh during the break scenes at work and those wonderful SavMart smocks.",One Hour Photo
446,imailwizz,Amazing,10,14 February 2004,"This movie is definately one of a kind.  I have never seen Robin Williams play anything besides a giddy babysitter or or a loving father figure. Disturbing and intense, this movie keeps you creeped out and wondering who you're taking your film to, as Williams stalks the innocent suburban family. Great for an older audience (teens etc...), but I don't recommend it as a Friday night movie with youngsters.  There is brief nudity, but nothing serious.  Two thumbs up!",One Hour Photo
447,mrgrieves,Over-hyped,4,10 May 2004,"With all the good reviews I had seen (and the great score on imdb) I was really looking forward to this film.But what I actually got was an unbelievably weak plot where nothing rang true.  For example, the photos of a couple having an extra-marital affair - you've got to wonder who was taking these photos.  The strop the wife throws near the beginning at her husband also felt like it came from out of nowhere and seemed crass, at best.Robin Williams was fine in the lead role, but other than that I can't think of anything else positive to say about this film.  It never for a second became intriguing or even believable.  For a TV movie with average reviews this would have been fine.I'll give it 4/10, but that's based on Robin Williams' performance and the fact that I managed to remain awake throughout.",One Hour Photo
448,Burgundy729,"Great Acting, Disappointing Plot",5,21 February 2004,"I still can't figure out what the point was.  The acting was phenomenal, the cinematography astounding, but the plot (or lack thereof) extremely disappointing.  If you're looking for a suspense-drama sans conclusion, this is it.  For those of us who like to know the ending of a movie, look elsewhere.",One Hour Photo

450,amsutfin,"The ultimate ""creep me out"" film",7,3 May 2005,"I had an inkling that Robin Williams could do this sort of thing, but how well he did it! This is the movie that, for the rest of my life, I will never be able to watch again. Growing up with Robin (I was 7 or 8 when Mork & Mindy first aired), I knew the funny, tender, pleasant, hysterically hilarious sides of one of my Hollywood faves quite well. I was completely unprepared for the darker side of him. It blindsided me, yet held me captive, until the terrifying conclusion.On a technical note, the director chose to use a weird kind of filter that, combined with Robin's blond ""do"" for this film, created an eerie tone to the film that wouldn't have been present with out it.",One Hour Photo
451,his_infernal_majesty_198,"Excellent directing, VERY promising talent in Romanek.",9,21 November 2005,"This film is a beauty, a very good piece of directing that will definitely be among my top films of 2000-2010. Romanek shows a CLEAR mastery of the visual form, stark colours, powerful acting and a screenplay that should have gotten more acclaim. The film follows Sy (Robin Williams). A lonely photo-processing-attendant, with no life outside the four walls of the supermarket in which he conforms to a drab existence involving grey uniforms, tedious elevator music... an atmosphere only made interesting by cheating couples amateur porn. His only other shred of a life is collecting photos of a customer, which he pins on a wall to his apartment. Sy becomes enraged when a detail to the customers life is discovered and he sets about fixing the problem in his own Sy the Psycho way. But be warned, the film is sometimes (once) terrifyingly scary and also (again once) terribly shocking. However with such a strong story and a great director behind it, this film explores emotions that not a lot of others films have managed.Inspired visually, ideologically and thematically by the master that was and forever will be Kubrick, any fan of the films he made will not be disappointed. So to SK fans out there, watch it, see if you recognise his style in this. WARNING: Opinion may be biased.",One Hour Photo
