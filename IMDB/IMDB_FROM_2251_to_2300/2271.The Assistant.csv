0,SnoopyStyle,Harvey,7,6 June 2020,"It's a day in the life of Jane (Julia Garner). For the last five weeks, she has worked in a non-descript New York office as an assistant to a ruthless Hollywood film producer. She caters to him which includes delivering a young beautiful girl. She struggles with her inner conflict.This is a throwback to a 70's faux-documentary style day-in-the-life movie. It can be very slow. It has the one big scene where it takes a half-step too far. For a movie with so much subtlety, it gets too specific on threatening Jane. She needs to take the hint five seconds earlier. It would be more compelling for her to cave sooner. This movie is obviously referencing Harvey Weinstein. Instead of a generic title, it should take the bull by the horns and call this Harvey. It would also be a meta reference to the old James Stewart movie where the imaginary rabbit is never seen. I understand the title is trying to be understated like the movie itself but sometimes, it needs to be overstated.",The Assistant
1,nogodnomasters,You like your job?,2,21 May 2020,"Jane (Julia Garner) works as an assistant in a film producer's office. She is a clerk, maid, bar tender, baby sitter, scheduler, book keeper, and travel arranger. It seems her boss, not named Harvey likes young girls (not underage) and meets with them as his wife wants to know where he is at. Jane is caught in the middle of it all and must turn a blind eye to the things she believes are happening if she wants to keep her job and advance.That's it. Her job is mundane. We only see what she sees which isn't a lot. Juicy parts left out. I guess there is a message for someone who cares to watch a boring film about sex without sex. I imagine the HR scene was the film's climax.Guide: F-word. No sex or nudity. Decent acting wasted on a boring film.",The Assistant
2,kosmasp,Mundane and detailed,7,4 March 2021,"Let's just say, that whoever did this, has experience when it comes to the life of an assistant. There is nothing fancy here and the ticks and tocks are subtle and not in your face. The life of an Assistant is not glamouros (in realityt that is and in the way it is depicted here) - this could easily be a documentary then.So your patience is being tested in a way, one would say. The movie is interesting to some then and annoying to boring to others. Be aware to which group you belong and act accordingly (watch or don't that is)",The Assistant
3,classicsoncall,"""Don't worry. You're not his type.""",7,22 August 2020,"In the early going, I knew right away this film would not appeal to a lot of viewers. It starts out slowly and never really revs up to any speed, however I did find the idea of the story compelling and provocative. As a newly hired assistant in a production office, Jane (Julia Garner) is not much more than a cog in an impersonal machine, handling menial assignments that come with the territory. There's almost the feeling that she keeps busy with tasks that she doesn't even have to do, like emptying the trash and babysitting the kids of her boss's nanny. Throughout there are hints that the 'boss', who's rarely if ever seen, is a serial womanizer who treats all of his employees with contempt. An attempt to level the playing field between herself and a brand new hire by visiting personnel results in Jane being subtly admonished to mind her own business if she wishes to remain employed.So with all that, what I was expecting in the way of resolution was some breakthrough moment, perhaps an Ozark style Ruthie assault that would leave heads spinning and a jerk of a boss summarily put in his place. Instead, the story diffuses with a whimper, with only the recognition that Jane doesn't have the power to effect change in an abusively hostile workplace. That ending is bound to elicit it's share of 'Is it over with' moments far and wide, and quite frankly, I had to do a rewind on my DVD to see if I had missed something. The sad thing about Jane, she probably winds up going back to work the very next day.",The Assistant
4,LeonLouisRicci,SO CLOSE YET SO FAR AWAY...WELL INTENDED PEEK,7,26 August 2021,"Ultimately Frustrating ""Reality"" about an Assistant to a ""Big-Time"" Hollywood Producer that is in Close-Proximity to Suspected Salacious Behavior but is Disarmed by the System and Her Colleague's Indifference.Well Acted by Julia Garner as ""The Assistant"" who is in Virtually Every-Shot.She Uses Facial Cues more than Dialog to Represent Her Growing Frustration and Slow-Burn.She Finally Decides to ""Do Something"" but as most News Stories in Real-Life Uncover, very Little Gets Done and even More is Unknown than Known.A Pulled From the Headlines Story of ""Today"" and the #MeToo Movement.The Film has No Answers and the Futility of it All may be the Movie's most Powerful Statement.But that Goes Against the Purpose and Goal of the Movement and doesn't Offer much Hope to Anyone Involved in the System or Not.Eventually the Film is Pointless and only an Exercise in Venting.But Frustrated and Abused Folks do need to Vent.In that Regard...It does have a Point After All.",The Assistant
5,evanston_dad,May Just Drive You Crazy,7,31 July 2020,"""The Assistant"" is either going to captivate you or bore you to hell. Sometimes it can do both at the same time.Julia Garner plays the eponymous assistant to some big-shot movie producer who we never see (though the film is clearly based on Harvey Weinstein, or at least on people like him and the environments that produce people like him). She gets to the office before the sun rises and spends her day cleaning out garbage cans, answering calls from his pissed off wife, managing his schedule, probably cutting his fingernails, changing his catheter, hell I don't know. Whatever she's doing, she looks like she wants to crawl into a hole and die while she's doing it. She puts up with the job because she wants to break into the movie biz herself, which we find out when she levels a half-assed complaint about sexual harassment (not of her, but of a newly hired girl) to the HR manager, who basically tells her to suck it up and deal with it because that's how the business works. I'm sure this is exactly how the business works, and I'm sure that's exactly how it's allowed to go on working the way it does. I felt bad for this girl in the abstract because it sucks that that's the way things are. But I felt sort of frustrated by her too, because who would go into something like the movie business and expect it to be any other way? Nobody gets the money and power that goes along with movie business fame without doing some sleazy things along the way. That's just the way it is, and how much sympathy am I obligated to feel for this privileged Northwestern grad who's getting a chance that fewer than 1% of people ever get?This is a really well made film though. It's expert at creating an environment of creeping dread out of a setting that's otherwise completely mundane.Grade: A-",The Assistant
6,blanbrn,Slow moving and slow paced movie that lives in the moment of being trapped in the system and the wanting for escape and freedom is felt.,6,21 May 2020,"Everyone now knows with the ""Me To Movement"" workplace and sexual misconduct awareness has become the norm as the need and want of having the courage for women to report is the norm. This film ""The Assistant"" is an okay take and look and these themes as it's central character Jane feels trapped and calls for cries of help while facing a good old boys system. The film moves in a slow and in the moment pacing as it follows one day in the life of Jane(Julia Garner) who as a recent college grad has hopes of being an aspiring film producer, and maybe has landed her apparent dream job as a temp or understudy to a powerful entertainment executive. However as the job and tasks go during the day it's plenty of work from cleaning, to booking appointments, to setting up client schedules only Jane grows to the norm of being overworked as she sees the underbelly of abuse she decides to speak up. Only it's like fighting a powerful me against the world good old boys system. Really this film is a take on how the powerful get away with abuse and really silence their understudy.",The Assistant

8,MOscarbradley,Deeply unsettling and unlike any other movie you will see on sexual abuse.,8,3 September 2020,"Following on from the Harvey Weinstien scandal and other instances of sexual abuse and harrassment by the rich and powerful I'm sure movies like ""The Assistant"" are going to become more common place but I doubt if many of them will be this strange, this unsettling or indeed this good. Although fiction, ""The Assistant"" looks and feels like it could be a documentary and Kitty Green, whose first feature this is, does indeed come from a documentary background.The assistant of the title, (a beautifully subdued Julia Garner), is a young woman employed in the New York office of a media mogul, not just as a kind of secretary, but as someone to clean up, (literally), the mess (literally), that her boss leaves behind and to take whatever verbal abuse he dishes out. She is safe, it would seem, from sexual harrasment because, as she's told, 'she's not his type'. The boss himself is never seen on screen.This is a genuinely frightening film that goes beyond what has come to be known as the #MeToo Movement. It paints a horrifying picture of what powerful people can do to subordinates given the chance, (I know because I too worked with such people but I, at least, had the balls to stand up to them...and not get fired). What distinguishes Green's film is that she never over-dramatizes, (if anything, she holds back almost to the point of boredom), uses actors who are not well-known to us, (a magnificently obsequious Matthew Macfadyen is the best known person on screen), and films it, not as a clammy thriller, but as a fly-on-the-wall slice of life. There is none of the triumphalism of ""Bombshell"" on display here, just the chilly feeling that an unseen monster is lurking out of camera shot and destroying the lives of everyone around him.",The Assistant
9,Cineanalyst,Drudgery,3,27 July 2020,"""The Assistant"" is a thoroughly realistic depiction of a day of office work. So, it's incredibly dull. Following the eponymous assistant around, as she performs menial tasks, nothing more interesting than watching someone answering a phone, writing emails, taking a break at the water cooler and washing dishes happens for half the movie. Even then, all we're offered is an ambiguous sermon on workplace abuse and ethics and sexual power dynamics, as the assistant faces backlash from going to the Human Resources department over her suspicion that her boss is having extramarital affairs and trading women employment for sex--although even that much she finds herself incapable of explicitly stating, as does the movie. That the assistant is played as a milquetoast compounds an already tedious scenario that's paced slowly. Had I known that ""The Assistant"" would be such a muddled message movie overrated by critics and to not really have anything to do with filmmaking despite the office being for a movie studio, I would've rather just seen ""Bombshell"" (2019) again.",The Assistant
10,westsideschl,Slice of Life,9,14 May 2020,"""Slice of Life"" literature or film are meant to have no plot, or ending both of which were the basis of most one/two star reviews. With no conflict, non-judgmental, and with every small detail presented (much to the annoyance of viewers not expecting or familiar with this structure) the viewer is left to speculate.We have a ""gopher"" assistant in a ""there are no secrets in an office"" setting. She makes our judgmental viewing selves push the boundaries by also displaying social anxiety traits (with facts & context getting muddled) which leads her (and us) to a questionable moment.",The Assistant
11,eddie_baggins,An important but frustrating slow-burn,4,23 June 2020,"The very definition of a slow-burn, so much so that a photocopier going about its business feels like a momentous event, The Assistant couldn't be a more timely film about the male dominated abuse that has flowed from the upper ranks of corporate businesses and in this case the film-making industry but Australian director Kitty Green's simmering offerings intent to remain almost entirely muted and devoid of spark halts this drama in its tracks.Her first foray into feature films after a string of well-received documentaries, Green showcases a keen eye and directional verve behind the camera here and its refreshing to see a female voice tackle an issue as timely and necessary to explore as the one examined in The Assistant but as a viewer you can't help but want more from this film that feels as though its building to a crescendo, only to flicker out without even an attempt to strike us down emotionally.Following the day to day mundane activities of Julia Garner's Jane, who is living the unenvious life of an assistant to a never seen studio CEO, a job which includes babysitting his children and listening to abusive phone calls from her detestable sounding boss, The Assistant literally makes us feel as though we are a fly on the wall to Jane's depressing life, which is a credit to the film but also a detrimental facet to the feature as we await, but never get a moment of true outrage or a moment worth remembering.The performance of Garner is impressive, dialed back to the point of almost non-existence, Jane is very much a plain everyday character, one that's hard to read or get a feel for, but she's front and centre throughout the piece that only really offers her a worthy counterpart when Matthew Macfadyen's HR boss comes into the picture and you become even more aware that the potentially nefarious and horrific things that go on in Jane's workplace are not only tolerated but largely ignored.You can see what Green is going for with all the various sly references to happenings around the place, embedding them into the everyday to showcase how tolerant we can become to issues that should be very far from commonplace but you just can't help but wish as a viewer you were getting more from this film, as watching everyday office work and day to day activities of someone we barely know or don't get to understand makes for rather tiresome viewing, even at a brisk under 90 minute runtime.Final Say -The Assistant has important themes and issues to explore but the at first gripping realistic approach quickly gives way to a mostly boorish plot line that fails to deliver an emotional kick or moment that would've made all the photocopying and phone calls worth enduring as a viewer.2 HR visits out of 5",The Assistant
12,matthewssilverhammer,Hit me like a horror film...,8,11 September 2020,"...only without the comfort of exaggeration or fantasy. Green employs exquisite camera composition to make the drab office environments a thing of sterile beauty, while Garner controls every uncomfortable on-screen moment with brilliantly still misery. Dehumanizing phone calls, oppressive mundanity, hopeless sexism.

13,marmar-69780,The Assistant,7,28 July 2020,"The assistant is a very slow film and that could take off many people from watching it,but to me it had a interesting but difficult story to show and i think that it suceeded in that mission,in a film we are following a young girl that works as assistant in some company how her daily work day is very hard to get through,either because very long shifts or because her boss that is using other young girls for his pleasure and and his selfish satisfaction,Julia Garner was great as our lead and she sold every her thought and expression just with her eyes,some people would say that this movie is basiacly a allegory to a Weinstein case and how that entire thing played out,but i saw something more from it,The Assistant was a very hard watch but with strong message and lesson",The Assistant
14,imseeg,Slow. Nothing dramatic happens. BUT the acting is terrific and the photography is terrific as well. And the subtlety of this story is best suited for art house fans.,7,2 May 2020,"It's slow. Nothing happens. And I mean really nothing happens. We simply get to see the life of an assistant at an office for a full day,BUT it is acted terrifically and subtle by the lovely Julia Garner, we got to know from her role in the Netflix series Ozark, as the fiery girl, but who now plays the opposite role of a very timid assistant brilliantly.There is more good: since nothing happens in this story, what is most enjoyable is the wonderful photography. Every single boring assistant task you can think of (copying, answering the phone etc) is photographed in such a way as if you were watching a vista on top of a hill. Beautiful.Any bad? Not suited for the impatient. Not suited for those who expect big drama. Entirely suited though for those art house movie fans, who love to watch a subtle, character portrait. Slow, yet beautifully subtle and touching.",The Assistant
15,paul-allaer,Julia Garner shines in stifling and devastating office working environment drama,8,15 February 2020,"""The Assistant"" (2019 release; 85 min.) brings a day in the life of Jane. As the movie opens, Jane comes into the office at a pre-dawn hour, and get the office ready for another work week. She seems to be doing a little bit of everything (answering the office phone, collecting documents, cleaning up, etc.) Gradually people are filing in, and we understand pretty quickly that this is a film production house, with a stifling working environment and the shadows of the (always off-camera) head of the company lurking everywhere. At this point we are 10 min. into the movie but to tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: this is the latest from Australian writer-director Kitty Green, but the first film she's directed that is not a documentary. The fictional story, which plays out over a single working day, is plot-heavy so let me just make a couple of general observations. First, the film is set almost entirely in the production company offices, and hence feels a bit like a theater play. Second, the movie is minimalist in approach, and what you hear off-camera and off-screen is just as important as what is on the screen (and interestingly, in the movie's closing credits, there are almost as many ""voice characters"" listed as there are acting performers). Third, the director is able to perfectly capture the stifling office environment, to the point where you get a sinking feeling in your stomach, and what I kept thinking was ""is this what it was like at the Weinstein Company offices?"". Last, but certainly not least, major kudos for the fantastic performance by Julia Garner as Jane. Garner She has been around for about a decade, but this may truly be her breakout role.""The Assistant"" premiered at last year's Telluride film festival to immediate acclaim, and it is no accident that this movie is currently certified 88% fresh on Rotten Tomatoes. The movie received a limited release in late January and has been rolling out to more cities in the subsequent weeks. It opens this weekend at my local art-house here in Cincinnati and I couldn't wait to see it. The Friday early evening screening where I saw this at was not attended well (7 people in total, to be exact), and that is a darn shame. If you are interested in better understanding the toxic working environment that many women have to live through in this day and age, I'd readily suggest you check this out, be it in the theater, on VOD or eventually on DVD/Blu-ray, and draw your own conclusion.",The Assistant
16,subxerogravity,It's like a movie Version of click bait.,6,6 February 2020,"Does that seem unfair? Cause technically a blockbuster is click bait, right!? Not really. It's obvious what this movie was trying to do and they delivered it in the most mundane way possible. Just like click bait, they lore you in with a topic you would enjoy but stretch out that topic till get gets boring.

All the wonderful little nuances, when added up together, makes one amazed how much torture an individual can put themselves through in the name of a career. My deepest sympathies.

So I shall keep my take on this Kitty Green directed masterpiece short and simple.Julia Gardner as 'Jane' The Assistant is all about jealously and not her concern for the new hire. Jane was obviously hired for her abilities, her talent, her job competency. She senses intuitively that other girls are there for the bosses pleasure, but she has no proof. This issue is brought to light during her meeting with HR.So, in my opinion, this film is more about what is going on in Jane's mind. No one else in the office complex seems to be interested in her. Even her boss treats her as a machine and keeps this machine well oiled with compliments.This film is NOT for the general public! It demands thought and insight.",The Assistant

I disagree somewhat.
Sure , the women are treated badly by the boss by either being used as a glorified maid ( in Jane's case ) or being recruited so he can get them into bed but to me it's about how an entry level employees are treated in most firms .How many people who work in an organisation feel they can go to HR and report their boss and it not getting back to him or not feel that their job is on the line ?
I certainly wouldn't trust HR in my workplace.This could have been a young man in the same position and he would have been treated the same way but I suppose the argument is that he probably wouldn't have hired a man ?The Assistant is slow paced and does at times feel just like someone's day at work and for that reason it might not be for everyone but I found it fascinating as well as infuriating.Not bad at all",The Assistant
24,jadepietro,A Quiet Place,7,14 August 2020,"GRADE: B-THIS FILM IS RECOMMENDED.IN BRIEF: A film about sexual harassment in the workplace that would rather whisper its words of protest against injustice when it needs to shout.JIM'S REVIEW: Kitty Green's drama, The Assistant, doesn't cover any new ground in its subject about sexual harassment in the workplace. The film remains a compelling tale to tell. Unfortunately, the toxic workplace has been with us for years and other films, like In Good Company (2004), 9 to 5 (1980), Working Girl (1988), and especially, last year's Oscar-nominated Bombshell, have most effectively shown its plight upon the lowly worker. But in this latest installment of the toxic work environment, the director/writer delivers a weighty contemporary ripped-from-the-headlines story that is still happening in this post-Weinstein Age of MeToo.Fresh out of college and securing her first real job as an assistant to a movie executive, Jane fills her day as a movie producer's assistant in NYC. She has been on the job for nearly two months doing menial tasks, making appointments, completing errands, and observing the unsavory behavior of her boss. He is never seen, only heard, a faceless predator on the prowl. Yet his abusive acts are common knowledge and gossip in the office shared by his mostly male staff. Their smirking jokes and innuendoes are the main topics of conversations which seem to confirm Jane's assumptions. Jane herself never become his prey...she not his type, or so she is told. Her views about the ongoing cover-up, while accurate, are all second-hand and circumstantial. Be that as it may, this matter still raises the ethical question: Should she become complicit in his sexual gamesmanship in her silence or speak out against this crime?The director, who also co-wrote the screenplay, captures the mundane goings-on of office life and the toxicity that follows. However, as she establishes the plot and the main character's dilemma, Ms. Green deliberately paces her film slowly which is detrimental to the movie's visceral impact and never allows the issue to properly build with enough tension.Ms Green provides an acting showcase for Julia Garner in a role that is totally internal and reactionary. Her character's emotions are reined in and stifled throughout most of the movie until the midway point when the taboo subject finally takes hold. Ms. Garner has a great scene, the film's only dramatic moment, which is so well-scripted and acted with intensity opposite a HR management type, skillfully portrayed by Matthew Macfadyen, who downplays her version of the events while offering ""helpful"" advice and false flattery. From this point, the film starts to become gripping and brutally honest in its message. But it is all a bit too late. One wishes more scenes in the movie took this direct confrontational approach to this hot topic and met the conflict head-on. The movie repeatedly underplays its hand too often.The Assistant is an admirable small independent film that tackles big issues in the subtlest of ways. It has much to say, but speaks in the quietest of whispers when it should be more enraged and outspoken in its execution. Victims of sexual abuse deserve a stronger voice. Make them hear you!",The Assistant
25,burlesonjesse5,VIEWS ON FILM review of The Assistant,5,2 May 2020,"""Long hours, first one in last one out"". Sounds like it could be a thankless job. And it could be even more thankless if you're second, third, or even fourth in command.Anyway, if you want to view a twisted secretary flick where ferocity ensues, then check out 1993's The Temp or Obsessed. If you want the polar opposite and something plucked from the low budget indie circuit, then The Assistant will be right up your alley.2019's ""Assistant"" has a cast of relative unknowns, a script that needs more cowbell, angry people only heard over the phone, and a nanosecond cameo from Patrick Wilson (he is listed as ""Famous Actor""). ""Assistant"" for the most part, is the antithesis of being entertained.The assistant in The Assistant is a young woman who works at a film production company in hopes of someday becoming a big time producer. Jane (played by Julia Garner) is said assistant and she is pasty, a little nosy, restrained, and unabashedly naive. In the only scene where the audience member doesn't feel totally detached, Jane goes to the HR department because she believes her superior is fooling around with a co-worker or two (tisk tisk).Directed by someone known for documentaries (Kitty Green), inspired by the Weinstein scandal, and having the feeling of watching paint dry even at eighty-seven minutes, ""Assistant"" is a slowly-mounting character study that never actually mounts. Personas are constantly passive sans an actual human interaction at the 50-minute mark and the pic feels like a docu when it really shouldn't (hint hint).Sterile, somewhat unassertive, arc-less, and without an actual music score (except for a couple of piano notes at the end), The Assistant gets a ""number two"" as in stars. It's the self-indulgent Gerry of office space dramatizations and something made with humanoids instead of humans.",The Assistant
26,Kingslaay,Feels unfinished,6,22 July 2020,"The Assistant had a great synopsis which promised a lot. Yet there was no payoff. The acting is good and there is suspense but sadly it goes nowhere. If the goal was to cast a light on the cold realities of work life and human nature then it does well. On some level it is refreshing to see what life is really like for many people. Nothing is glamorized or exaggerated. However it felt unfinished, like we saw only half the story. It was as if the writer or director was so eager not to miss a deadline that they submitted an unfinished script.There was no explosive events or anything to turn it on its head. When the credits started to roll I was surprised as I thought there was more ground or story left to cover.",The Assistant

Entertaining might not be the best word to describe it, but neither is boring. It maintains a sense of quiet discomfort throughout, and the apathy of a toxic workplace and predatory behaviour of the higher-ups is explored extremely well with this stripped down, non-heightened approach.I was glad I knew it was subdued and grounded before going in, as if I'd expected more, I may have spent all 80-something minutes of its runtime waiting for the ""plot"" to start happening.Despite it being quiet and low key, it's also definitely not subtle. It's pretty clear what (or arguably even who) the movie is about, and I guess the very dry, quiet presentation with the strong and far from subdued intentions of the film did make for an odd but usually interesting contrast.Also worth mentioning is that Julia Garner was great in the lead role, but the rest of the cast are mostly just decent.",The Assistant

The complete portrait of a corporate monster.This movie captures the nauseating feeling of both complicity and powerlessness - telegraphed so beautifully onto Garner's expressions.

31,sergelamarche,A view point,6,19 June 2021,I found this rendering a bit dry. The poor girl is undervalued and overworked to the limit of credibility for the film. She's also a bit old fashioned in a bad way. Very well played but not credible for me.,The Assistant
32,rockman182,The Assistant (2020),7,2 February 2020,"I didn't know much about this film until mid last week. I ended up attending the show with a Q and A after the movie with writer and director, Kitty Green. Here is a filmmaker who I don't really know anything about but I was already a fan of Julia Garner. I really liked her on The Americans and knew she was going to blow up soon. She is fantastic in this minimalist performance about a timely and important issue that is ever present in modern times.The film shows the entire day of work of an assistant at an office of a powerful film executive. During her time there, she sees conspicuous activities and young females being brought into the office and given roles after they meet with her boss even during late hours. She starts to realize what is going on and the predatory behavior involved but must deal with being silenced and has to weigh up how important her job is to her. Julia Garner plays Jane, in her most fulfilled role to date.
From the opening frame of the film this is a beautiful visual experience. The film is quiet at times as you watch Jane take care of daily activities in the office. You can put the clues together to find out what is going on in the office and how the women are being sexually exploited. The film never mentions it but this film was definitely inspired by the story of Harvey Weinstein. The breathy voice on the phone calls also is reminiscent of Weinstein. This film is so competently shot throughout the office.The way Garner emotes through her facial expressions truly tell the story of her internal struggle. The issue is timely and unfortunately something that occurs today. She has to be silenced because there are people that are more powerful than her who disregard her when she comes forward to speak up. This film kind of shows scenarios as to why it might be difficult for people to come forward when they witness something immoral. Garner is fantastic in this film. The Assistant is a fairly succinct film but immensely powerful in its depictions and is definitely one that has talking points.

33,spookyrat1,That's ... Not Entertainment!,3,9 October 2021,"Writer/Director Kitty Green submits her micro - budget indi - take on the Harvey Weinstein - Me too thing. It's well - acted and relentlessly downbeat from start to finish. There's just nothing to make the story stand out. No twists in the tail! No engaging character studies.In the title role, Julie Garner creates a realistic, but completely uninteresting lead character, (plain) Jane, through whose eyes, we get to experience a very long, extremely dull working day, in her mundane existence. She works as a junior assistant at a film production company. From the get go, she clearly doesn't appear to like her job and everything that plays out in the storyline confirms our initial take of her character. So one has to ask, why does a youngish, single woman stay in such a job, where she is continually unappreciated, besides being over - worked?I'm not saying the story doesn't ring true, because it mostly does. ( I do very much doubt the the mogul producer's wife would continually ring the junior office assistant for updates on hubby, rather than his personal assistant.) It's just that the narrative fails to stimulate, just as Jane, through her complete mousiness and obsequiousness fails to gain our sympathy. Quite honestly, I'd rather go and watch some colourful paint dry, than be forced to suffer through a second viewing of The Assistant.",The Assistant
34,bob-the-movie-man,5.9? Were you all watching a different movie from me?,9,24 May 2020,"I refuse to follow ""the pack"" on this one... I thought it was great. It manages to make the mundane incredibly tense. This is this first (semi-)fictional feature from documentary-maker Kitty Green.... and in my book she does a knock-out job.We first meet Jane (Julia Garner) at 'God-knows-what-o-clock' in the morning as she arrives at her workplace - a New York film-production company. First to arrive every morning, she turns on the lights, turns on the screens, makes the pot of coffee and cleans off stains from her boss's couch. The stain isn't coffee. A lost gold bracelet is recovered.For we are in a truly toxic working environment here. 'The boss' - clearly modelled on Harvey Weinstein - is a bullying tyrant who can reduce Jane and her two male assistants (Jon Orsini and Noah Robbins) to quivering wrecks. ""WHAT DID YOU SAY TO HER"" barks the boss down the phone at Jane, after she has had a perfectly reasonable phone conversation with the estranged Mrs Boss.The toxicity is pervasive though throughout Miram..., sorry...., 'the company'. Jane is almost invisible to her other co-workers who don't give her eye-contact even when she's talking to them and barely register her presence when sharing a lift.But bullying and workplace toxicity is just part of this story. A steady stream of starlets arrive in the office, like meat deliveries to a butcher. In a chilling sequence, the photocopier churns out photos of beautiful actresses.... a paper-based equivalent of swiping-left or -right in the selection process. None of the ""if you... I will"" discussions are shown, but they don't need to be: the inference is clear.Jane is smart, slim and pretty... but not in an obvious 'Hollywood way'. ""You'll be OK..."" says a co-worker ""you're not his type"".But someone who distinctly is ""his type"" is Sienna (Kristine Froseth), a ""very very young"" aspiring waitress-come-actress from Boise, who suddenly and unexpectedly arrives as a ""new assistant""... to be promptly put up in a swanky hotel room. It's time to act... and Jane approaches the company HR manager (Matthew Macfadyen)....An old Spielberg trick is to increase tension by keeping the ""monster"" hidden from view: cue the tanker driver from ""Duel"" and (for most of the film) the shark from ""Jaws"". Here, the boss is felt only as a malevolent force and never seen on screen. It's an approach that works brilliantly, focusing the emotion on the effect he has on those flamed.There is also recognition that these powerful people are also hugely intelligent and manipulative. Seeing that Jane is a valuable asset, the public berating is sometimes followed up with a private email apology.... dripping a few words of encouragement and praise like a few drops of Methadone to a drug-addict.This is an excellent movie and thoughtfully and elegantly directed. Following a normal day in Jane's work life.... albeit a day where perhaps the penny finally drops... is immersive and engaging. And at only 88 minutes long, the movie never outstays its welcome.The performances are first rate. Julia Garner is magnificent, and in a year where the Oscars will be ""interesting"", here's a good candidate for Best Actress I would suggest if not Best Picture. Garner's an actress I'm unfamiliar with: the only one of her previous flicks I've seen was Sin City 2.Also oily and impressive is Matthew Macfadyen as the HR manager. There's also a sparse but well-used score by Tamar-kali.The one area I found poor was in the sound design. It's clearly filmed in an office environment, rather than on a sound stage, and unfortunately the combination of the acoustics and the New York accents makes some of the dialogue really difficult to hear. An example is a discussion between two co-workers in an office kitchen, which was completely indecipherable for me.Should I watch this? In my view, definitely, yes. It's chilling and an insight into the terrible ordeal that many professional women in the film industry, and other industries, have had to put up with before the ""Me Too"" lid was blown off (and many probably still do). The most telling line in the film? At the end of the ""Thanks"" in the end-titles: ""All those who shared their experiences"".",The Assistant

36,tm-sheehan,Compelling and Disturbing,7,15 March 2021,"My Review - ""The Assistant ""Streaming on Foxtel & PrimeMy Rating 7/10
I hope that this small budget but well crafted 2019 movie that has only grossed $1.3 million USD gets a wide viewing from men and women alike but most men I feel would switch off after the first half hour of this short 1.27 minute film because it's a slow and subtle little Drama in a young woman's daily work life and that's a sad thought.I was fortunate enough to work for many years in a large Corporation Telstra that had a solid and strict Equal Employment Policy with a clear complaint reporting process .
Today we have a Women's March for Justice in our Federal Capital to bring awareness of an obvious lack of the EEO Principles that I had to promote and report as an elected Staff Delegate in Telstra . I volunteered for that role because as a Gay man I did see examples of homophobic slurs and work place insults when I started there in 1988 by the time I left 18years later it had all but disappeared not because of me but because of the EEO Policy that the whole workplace had been educated with.Why I mention my experience and rarely mention Politics on Terryard is that this is what I observed in "" The Assistant"" a quiet ,cold ,bleak but so effective little movie about a bright young intelligent woman who has chosen a career in small movie production office in New York City but observes misogyny and sexual misconduct, especially from her shadowy "" Harvey Weinstein "" like character boss .
Beyond a few unfocused glimpses of a hulking figure roaming his office in the background, the Weinstein of ""The Assistant"" is a phantom menace who barrels down on the young woman's life, but this fascinating psychological investigation doesn't allow him to hijack a story that belongs to her.
. ""The Assistant"" explores the harassment and control that kept the Weinstein's of this word unwitting enablers under his grip even Janes's two genial male colleagues are passive accomplices because in protecting their careers and admitting their awareness by comments like "" just don't sit on the sofa '"" in their bosses office they contribute to Jane's powerlessness.
Directed and written by Kitty Green 'The Assistant "" stayed in my mind after I watched it mainly because of the impressive performance of Julia Garner as Jane (remember her as Ruth Langmore in ""Ozark""?)
In an almost Docudrama style we follow one day in the life of Jane (Julia Garner), a recent college graduate and aspiring film producer, who has recently landed her dream job as a junior assistant to a powerful entertainment mogul. Her day is much like any other assistant's - making coffee, changing the paper in the copy machine, ordering lunch, arranging travel, and taking phone messages.
But as we follow Jane's daily routine, we, grow increasingly aware of the abuse that insidiously colors every aspect of her work day, an accumulation of degradations against which Jane decides to take a stand, only to discover the true depth of the system into which she has entered. When a new younger woman is recruited as another ""assistant "" for her boss and not because of her experience but is obviously being groomed as a sexual conquest and put up in a swank hotel to await her ""orientation ""
Matthew MacFadyen has a small but very powerful role as Wilcock the executive who Jane tries to report her fears for the young girl . His cold indifference indicating complicity in Jane's bosses activities soon make Jane aware that if she goes ahead with her complaint any hope of a career in an industry that has 1000's of willing applicants knocking will be over.
This is not a big budget film like ""Bombshell"" same year same subject but I think possibly more effective because it made me wonder how many women in how many offices are still going through this battle over Power versus Powerlessness in our City today.

A total punch in the gut that should be required watching for anyone really but more specifically young people starting out - especially those going into the film business. Too many have stars in their eyes with visions of nothing but positive outcomes guaranteed when the reality is anything but. And my God does it show the sexism that pervades offices everywhere. The main character is picking up after everyone, they walk all over her, disrespect her, and basically look right past her. She's invisible. No one cares about her. The worst part she is forced to apologize to her despicable boss who is nothing more than a skeezy predator in a glass tower. I get that this was supposed to be an interpretation of the whole Weinstein thing but this kind of stuff happens every day all over the world.This is the perfect movie to watch and discuss. We can look at what was playing out onscreen and call it for what it was but this shows you how everyone was complicit in glossing over or covering for his bad behavior. You get to see how people can enter these moral conundrums. I mean really at the end of the day unless you are willing to quit your job we all have to put up with bad behavior in some form or another in our chosen occupation. It doesn't necessarily mean someone is a predator or harming others physically but there should be an accepted modicum of decency, manners and respect in the workforce but more often than not there just isn't. Instead of calling people out for being a**holes we ""play nice"" and say stuff like ""Oh that's just Jim being Jim."" OR ""Don't take their yelling or demeaning behavior personally...they are really good at what they do and they are just stressed. We need to make their lives as easy as possible so just let that stuff roll off your back."" You get the idea. In every workplace there is never any reason for anyone to yell or talk down to others period. Everyone is an adult and should be treated like one.I don't know what the main character decided to do in the end but I'm guessing she just sucked it up and went back to work. She would eventually become just as complicit as the rest and in the process would pry never go on to do what she set out to do...produce films. She might eventually get disillusioned and quit in shame or eventually be fired when she no longer served a purpose.This won't be for everyone because unfortunately most people don't want to watch serious films that make you think or have deep discussions but this film is relevant and important and so worth a watch. It is slow and basically boring but that is life. This was done perfectly. I can't find fault with it. It's a shame it has been mostly overlooked or dismissed without giving it a chance.

Am I aware that there are many women in these sucky, bleak lackluster jobs where they are observing powerful men getting away with behaving badly, absolutely! But before you start hating me...let me say that as a woman, I have higher standards for women in general. Stop putting up with the behavior, just stop. It takes two and the casting couch wouldn't be a thing if women refused. Is your body and your self respect not worth saying no? If all actresses refused to have sex with the producers etc, the casting couch wouldn't exist. I'm not saying it is right, DONOT take this in any way as an endorsement for the misogynistic ass**** behavior, but I refuse to let the women off the hook or allow them to compare the casting couch to something like what a rape victim goes through! I have worked at a trauma center way to long for that! If women have sex for the role or sex for the job what ever it is, they are making a choice and they should be woman enough to own their choice and take responsibility for it. I refuse to let them off the hook, for their role...because as I said if all of the women refused, it would not exist therefore they are culpable. Yes, I have high standards...but I think as women that we should have high standards and we should support and help one another and not ""turn the other cheek""...or say things like ""Don't worry she'll get more out of it than he will.""Now back to this film, it was incredibly slow and did an excellent job showcasing this bleak, tedious and dull job of our main character...the assistant. Who apparently has a college degree, but this is her job...and she better keep it because there are 40 more candidates for her job. It was really difficult to have sympathy for her since no one is holding a gun to her head and making her do this job. Here is a tip, have some self respect and get some gumption and quit. Get some ambition, have a goal and get out of this horrific situation that you have been in for 5 week. Yes, she has no hard evidence against her boss, just office jokes and supposition...so get out. There is nothing keeping you there. This movie should have lasted 5 min.Side note...""oh, Mr. Darcy...how far you have fallen in my eyes.""I personally would have probably been fired on day one, when I told the boss what's what and personally I think the world would be a better place if wives, assistants, actresses etc. refused to put up with bad behavior. Start by respecting yourself and then help and respect others and if we all did that we would live in a much better world.Until then, refuse to participate and vote with your money.Finally note, it was well filmed for its slow portrayal. I like the use of the dark and dim lighting. The stillness and silence was also used very powerfully. And our lead actress did a wonderful job portraying this meek, put upon character trying to make you feel that it is all out of her control....I particularly appreciated the dour facial expression that she seemed to have mastered by the end of the film.

She's trying to make her way in the film business, and we follow her through her working day as she becomes steadily and inexorably more aware of the slow drip of repeated and varied abuses, insults, rejections, indignities and being patronised. Throughout it all, Garner's performance is a thing of quiet wonder; her face, her terse line deliveries and movements that attempt to take up as a little space as possible all betraying a woman trying to press down inside her what is destined to either erupt or corrode. It reminded me of the in many ways vastly different Falling Down as stress is piled on stress; only in this case, there is no violent catharsis because such things are not permitted to a woman - especially not one who wants a career in the future. This is not the first film to emerge from the #metoo moments, but in time to come, we may look back on its quiet economy but unmistakable righteous anger as one of the best.",The Assistant

Julia Garner works the hell out of the very little she is given to work with. But she's not chewing a script with the bite, resonance, or action of her work on Ozark. If only.On the whole, I enjoy low-key films like this, especially when they are visually appealing (this is). I know the point is to be put in the head of the protagonist, but the main problem, beyond the airy nature of the ""plot"", is that nothing happens to Garner's character that is not (sadly) commonplace in the Real World. That doesn't make what she suffers right, but it also doesn't make for a very intriguing or empathic set-up, unless maybe you've never held ANY office job before, whatsoever.The Assistant comes to life briefly when Matt Macfadyen, doing a bone-chilling turn as a mid-level HR flunkie, serves it to Garner straight: Nothing she's complaining about is out-of-line, everybody knows there's a problem, but guess what.... her boss is the Big Boss, and for better or worse all she's going to accomplish by letting off steam is getting herself fired faster than she would have otherwise.This film should have gone deeper, should have exposed more layers of the environment and added a few more plot elements, but the snail's pace of this film guarantees it will obsolete itself in most viewers memories shortly after they turn it off. By the mid-point (45 freaking minutes in) , almost nothing develops except for a few brief angry phone conversations as we follow Garner around the office doing mundane grunt-level tasks. I think it was a good move to keep Big Boss off camera. It's obvious who that character is modeled on, but there's nothing enlightening here.Yes, bosses can be jerks... sexist, selfish, pigs. Yeah, we get that. They can also implicate their subordinates in any number of filthy scams solely for their own sadistic pleasure and monetary benefits. You either put up with it or you quit.

Most ""day in the life"" stories are typically about more ""interesting"" characters. Something like a war officer, or a teenager wilding out on the last day of school. Instead of tackling a ""cinematic"" story like something I mentioned, this takes on a day in the life of a secretary. 'The Assistant' to a Harvey Weinstein type Hollywood producer. The entirety of the runtime takes place during one day in this assistants life. We see her make shakes, coordinate schedules, make phone calls, and even clean the producer's desk off. She does all the odd jobs and manual labor this producer doesn't have time to do himself. Which, sounds innocent enough. Most people that have both excess money and power, who are also short on time, generally have an assistant like this. However, the beauty and tragedy of this movie is in the subtle details. Since this seems to be a direct parallel to a Harvey Weinstein, there's subtle, but apparent hints at abuse. Girls come and go from his office, earrings are found on the floor, and he has personal meetings at hotels in town. Again, this isn't particularly cinematic, which is why I think it has received an overall mixed reception. People call it boring or a waste of time, which it isn't. There's plenty going on here and a lot to get out of this. It's just not what you'd expect to see from a movie, generally speaking. Even though I enjoyed this and think it has a lot of power behind it, there were stretches where it lost me. Scenes tend to spend a little to long on certain aspects or drag things out a bit much. Some scenes are literally the assistant standing in the break room washing dishes. Then there are scenes so masterfully executed, I can't imagine doing them any other way. The scene where she attempts to report what she's seen to HR stands out the most. It's disturbing, subtle, and most of all it reinforces the idea that, while most people are actively participating in abuse, they all know about it. Where the film really shines, apart from the horrifyingly honest portrayal of abuse, is with it's visuals. It's utterly gorgeous, every shot is perfectly composed and beautifully lit. Striking is a word that I would use to describe it but clinical, may be even more accurate. Harsh white lighting makes the bulk of the films light which helps capture how mundane this is to these people. It's appalling to see every single person our main character work with treating sexual misconduct as a punch line, but to them, it's daily life.

The immersion experience for the viewer in this work reality, first harmless, is total. Our point of view is always that of Jane, which allows a ""lateral"" look at what is being revealed and also feel with her the mistreatment that she herself suffers or perceives.
Jane brings us reminiscences of Elisabeth Moss's Peggy in Mad Men.All this Green achieves with his surgical detail as a documentary filmmaker, an absolute elegance in the frames, an intelligent use of medium shots or details and a masterful use of the off-field.Due to all these characteristics and the nature of its protagonist, The Assistant is located in the antipodes of the Hollywood scandal (Bombshell, the well-known ""based on real events""), making the approach to the issue of harassment and labor abuse much more daily and disturbing.Julia Garner does an extraordinary and subtle job, with her lonely Jane who is recording and feeling everything that happens around her, all the time on screen and at work, almost without being able to peek into her private life, speaking little and telling us everything .",The Assistant
53,Michael Fargo,A film that provokes,9,27 February 2020,"This isn't a film that is formulaic or one that preaches. It presents a situation, shows the conflict of the central character, and leaves you asking, ""What would I do?"" There aren't easy answers, and I found myself considering rationalizations, none of which were satisfactory. This is a societal problem that needs exposing before it can be rectified.Current headlines have unveiled some more famous and extreme examples of the problem, and also show the perils victims--and in this case--that the witnesses who enable must face.Should I sacrifice my career? Should I go to outside law enforcement since the first line of defense is fixed in favor of the abuser? Is it really my problem since these are consenting adults?I've personally never found myself in a work environment where this was an issue. At age 73, perhaps I was just lucky. I don't think I was blind to a situation. In many ways this can be compared to the abuse of women and children by religious leaders. It happens outside the observation of anyone besides the predator and the victim. But when you're asked to enable, what can you do? I would like to think I'd refuse. But I could see this character's dilemma.
In an industry where the opportunities are limited and you've been given a plum job, it would be hard to sabotage your career by exposing criminal behavior. If this character had simply quit, there's always burden of ""What could I have done?"" that you'd carry with you for the rest of your life.Julia Garner is always a pleasure to watch. Her considerable skills aren't demanded by this role, a passive person silently witnesses something she feels is very wrong. The device of never showing the abuser keeps the focus on her. The cast of characters around her are suitably sleazy and recognizable. The isolation of being new to the ""big city"" is also very haunting. It's like being on a different planet where survival depends on cooperating with others.After watching the film we talked much more about it's meaning than almost any other film I've seen in decades.",The Assistant
54,Boristhemoggy,"Julia Garner at her utmost best, in a bad film",6,22 May 2020,"I mean, write a script about an office assistant who makes coffee, empties trash, takes notes, photocopies, and does sundry other tasks around an office, and make it into a full blown feature film.
Then, put a false description to it by saying it outs all the abuses carried out by managers against junior staff, it does not. All it does is show life as an assistant with some warts.
It does not raise many thorny issues and it definitely does not debate them or explore them, it simply observes them.
However the one reason I watched this tedious and pretentious film from start to finish without a break was simply Julia Garner. She made it compelling and immersive and at the end I felt like I had almost witnessed art.
Don't misunderstand this was not the skill of the director or the intelligence of the script, it was the superlative skill of Julia Garner who excels in these types of roles and gives them body and depth. I believed for every single second that she was on screen that she was going through what you'd expect.
if you value quirky or arty, if you value simply brilliance in acting, watch it, then watch everything else Garner has ever done, she is a master.",The Assistant
55,lucasnochez,Film Review: The Assistant/www.nightfilmreviews.com,6,27 February 2020,"Welcome! Have a seat.As normal a greeting as could be, yet, the ramifications of such words hold such heavy and enduring provocations in Kitty Green's feature film debut The Assistant.Fairly new to the narrative feature film world, Australian born Kitty Green gives audience members a documentarian style, ""day in the life of"" type film, shadowing the daily routine life of Jane (Julia Garner). Jane is a highly stressed, over-worked, entry-level assistant to an unnamed film mogul in New York City.Seems like pretty regular stuff, right? Yet, Green's Assistant is nothing short of extraordinary, yet completely relatable and ordinary to so many people watching it. Doused in elements of film-noir, to elements of an extreme thriller, The Assistant is a bold and brave new voice at the dawn of the #MeToo era of socially conscious, gender-inclusive filmmaking. And while the coincidences of the Harvey Weinstein case are hard to shake while watching each and every gripping frame of this film, it becomes a double-edged sword, of sorts, for Green's chilling message. Yes, the obvious similarities to the once-famed and respected film mogul are apparent, yet this translucent piece of cinema is neither a documentation or reimagining of the obscenities of that one person, rather a realization that such small, impactful and everyday choices are heralded everyday, in every office, every workplace and happens or has happened to each and every one of us, regardless of gender.Gathering the voices and stories of so many nameless individuals, as well as her own experiences in the world of film, Green uses subtle little anecdotes of each and every one of us, to relay a story as timeless as it is timely.Stressed with on-going mundane tasks, Jane is subjected to so many responsibilities at her place of employment. From shifting schedules, booking hotels, travel arrangements and lying regularly to people over the phone, Jane's good-hearted and innocent spirit is constantly battling and struggling with her own moral compass. Yet, with every opportunity of being kind-hearted, loyal and honest, her actions are almost immediately overmanned and undermined with character degrading emails to her boss, apologizing and asking for his forgiveness. Sentences such as, ""I overreacted"", ""It was not my place"", or """"I will not let you down again"", flood the screen of Jane's emails. But Green is much more interested in the tiny actions much more than the larger melodrama filling most multiplexes today.Like many classics thrillers, including Psycho and Rear Window, the notion that what's shown off-screen will always be scarier than what we see on-screen; Green takes notes from these masterclass directors and shows her confidence in her actors and screenplay, allowing the heavy words and off-screen actions to thrill, disturb and keep the audience's imagination constantly churning. While its hard to ignore the not-so-subtle messages being yelled towards the screen, the whole concept of ignoring what is right in front of you, and being ignored, are both very complex aspects of The Assistant. As an audience, we ask ourselves, ""What can we do?"", if we were in Jane's position, or if, we are in fact, in Jane's position right NOW. Then, question like, ""what do we do?"" are the questions left flooding our own heads.The Assistant, although casted with gendered actors, is a genderless and mandatory ""fly-in-the-soup"" type cinematic experience. The audience can easily imagine the role of Jane being a male, and the mogul role being a female, or both males or female characters, interchangeably. The genders portrayed in the films are as irrelevant as exactly what happens behind closed doors in each and every one of those offices. What matters most is the actions we take, even when our actions sometimes have no real ramifications or resolve. A challenge seen when Jane approaches Mr. Willcock, her HR department head, who, without hesitation, completely ignores her very strong cases of obvious sexual misconduct in the workplace, involving, none of than the commander-in-chief. Yet, like so many other nameless faces before and after Jane, instead of facing issues presented by disgruntled employees because of people in high place of power, these people who are hired to enact action and take the positions of the workers, threatens her position within the company; implying that he thought she was ""smart"", as well as reminding her as competitive her position is and how she was chosen amongst so many other women who applied. Yet, throughout the film, through conversations Jane has with her parents, friends and family, constantly remind and encourage her just how ""proud"" they are of the position she has earned, and being constantly brainwashed just by how much of a great opportunity this is for her and her potential future. It becomes clear that the job that a bright young woman once wanted, becomes a very real nightmare she lives out each and everyday. This position, becomes a contorted, idealistic acceptance of abusive workplace normality, a symbol of so many other workplaces that are being plagued globally.Luckily for us, the face, front and centre of The Assistant is Julia Garner. A doe-eyed and very talented actress who has previously been seen in other masterworks such as Sean Durkin's Martha Marcy May Marlene. Garner delivers, easily, her best performance to date. Showcasing her nuanced demeanour in the most mundane of ways, Garner commands the screen and her role of Jane with formidable confidence and poise. From photocopying headshots of attractive women, welcoming countless beautiful young women into the office space and meeting with children, Garner's Jane is the Jane Doe that we all know, need and relate to, compassionately. Blending notions of defeat, pain, suffering and professionalism all on screen, Garner is a revelation to watch.The Assistant premiered at the 2020 Sundance Film Festival a mere few days ago, and will, without question, have a lingering and long-lasted effect on whomever watches it. Sleek, icy-cold and emotionally driven, The Assistant is a film we all need and deserve, in an era where comments such as ""You're not his type"", or physical appearances dictate the work you do, the qualities of your character, the the positions you land in the workplace and the stories you tell. The importance of this film is not just generational, but The Assistant is an assistance to the very small yet impactful steps people around the world need to take in order for change to happen. The first step to addressing every problem, is owning and realizing that there is a problem. The Assistant may be a small and quiet film, but it is yelling at the top of its lungs, campaigning and being a renegade for a very loud and on-going issue happening everywhere.Looks like this decade is off to a very great start. Why don't you take off your jacket? Make yourself comfortable? Stay a while.",The Assistant
56,jennfinn,Boring / Horrible Actress,3,31 May 2021,Very important subject matter but the movie itself is to boring to care. The movie is a really good idea but the execution is horrible.

57,eelen-seth,Necessary viewing - intoscreens.com,8,26 May 2020,"In Kitty Green's narrative debut 'The Assistant', we follow one day in the life of Jane (Julia Garner - 'Ozark'), a recent college graduate and aspiring film producer, who has recently landed her dream job as a junior assistant to a powerful entertainment mogul. Her day is much like any other assistant's - making coffee, changing the paper in the copy machine, ordering lunch, arranging travel, taking phone messages. But as Jane follows her daily routine, she, and we, grow increasingly aware of the abuse that insidiously colours every aspect of her work day, an accumulation of degradation against which Jane decides to take a stand, only to discover the true depth of the system into which she has entered.The condition of being involved with others in an activity that is unlawful or morally wrong, that's the definition of the word ""complicity"". Just like Jane, it's up to every one of us to address wrongdoings wherever we work or live. The film, very much inspired by the entire Harvey Weinstein-scandal, in which he used his power to mentally and physically abuse upcoming and existing talent in Hollywood. This all exploded into the 'Me Too'-movement, where women (and men) of all ages and background came forward to address the sexual abuse and intimidation they had to endure throughout their careers and personal lives.The Assistant plays like a whistleblower kind of story, in which we follow Jane, who is trying to stop her boss' behaviour, before things get even more out of control. Throughout the day, we meet her co-workers, who may or may not be aware of the immoral crimes that are going on behind-the-scenes, as they push Jane in a direction to keep her job safe and her mouth shut. We, as the audience, never leave her side, and even though Jane doesn't say a lot, keeping a composed and professional attitude, we can feel the anger boiling deep inside her as it transcends into us.The many smaller production companies attached to the film show that director/writer Green probably had a harder time to get this made. The story stays quite simple, which shows her talent in film making as she could've easily gone for full on shock value to keep a more mainstream audience entertained. Every action and camera shot speaks for itself, while Garner gives another career defining performance, after winning an Emmy for her work in 'Ozark'.The Assistant makes you feel just as powerless as its protagonist, while the subtle signs of intimidation pile up. Kitty Green handles her powerful #MeToo-statement with a unique vision, keeping the ball rolling to remind everyone there's still a lot of issues that need to be resolved.",The Assistant
58,eyeintrees,Why the modern world is steeped in depression and illness,7,28 June 2020,"Here we have the toxic world of white men. Pointless jobs that keep the 'machine' rolling, I don't care if this job is about the movie industry or whatever; this girl's job is reflected in a million offices around the globe in a million industries.
The silly hope that doing crap for a wage will one day create a space where you will finally actually be promoted to do what you want. Yeah, right.A movie that needed to be made and therefore worthy of screen time. Very, very well acted because it relies on what is not said, what is not 'noticed', what is not commented on about, out load. but instead on all of the misery and despair and pointlessness of what is internalised by anyone who is locked into this kind of 'going nowhere'; friendlessly, alone, unsupported. Family offering chiches instead of actually wanting to hear anything real. Not good enough but it happens all the time.
Not a film for everyone, though. If you haven't worked in a job that proffers no joy, that will no doubt never, ever get you anywhere much and where no one really notices you, then this will possibly not mean much. But if you have, you will understand how well it's done. A tragic sign of why going to work, which should be at least bearable if not great, makes people heartsick, depressed and suicidal.

Its a movie with a bunch of offices noises and an Assistant that goes about her daily tasks and THAT IS IT.!!!Where there should be wrong doing, it is only very very vaguely hinted at with zero evidence. The only actual wrong doing other than letting this see the light of day, was the heinous crime committed by HR of betraying an employees trust.To those that loved it.

63,RMurray847,"Super slow pace, but somehow still powerful at times.",6,8 January 2021,"A couple of years ago, the movie A GHOST STORY, which was pretty slow-paced anyway, had a lengthy scene in which we basically watched a grieving Rooney Mara sit on her kitchen floor and eat an entire pie. It took her several minutes, and we were left to watch her going through a well of emotions while eating this pie...all in one long shot. It was both amazing and a bit maddening. Movies don't do that!THE ASSISTANT feels like it's doing this for its entire run time! I'm sure I've sat through slower movies, but I can't remember when. If you aren't interested in watching mostly the internal life of one low level executive assistant at a movie production company go through just one work day, doing mostly mundane tasks...stay away. Basically we see this young lady arrive at work before anyone else, do dull things like start the coffee, take phone calls and low level ""joking"" comments from folks just very slightly higher on the chain than her, and have her day enlivened by random calls from the ""boss"" (no doubt meant to be a stand-in for Harvey Weinstein...although we never see this man) who yells at her and demeans her. Sometimes she gets to run chores outside the office, including escorting a new young prospect to a hotel where she is clearly going to have an assignation with the aforementioned boss. There are other events that occur, but in short, the movie tries to immerse us in an office environment that is very male-heavy, and clearly has lots of things going on that would send most HR departments screaming into the night, but are tolerated because they are committed by the iron-fisted, terrifying boss who is powerful and can control careers with a phone call. We see the slow grinding down of this assistant...she's not a direct victim of abuse, but never has a movie done a better job of showing how a work CULTURE can impact everyone. We see this quiet young lady and the burden her knowledge and conditions have created.There is a scene just past the midpoint where she finally has had enough and goes to HR to complain. That scene, with the seemingly sympathetic but ultimately slimy HR person (Matthew MacFayden...hard to believe this guy once played Mr. Darcy!), is remarkably powerful. It's really the first scene that isn't primarily just our experience with the assistant, which I'm sure makes it more impactful...but this 5 minutes makes the movie as a whole worthwhile. It demonstrates the dangers of ""speaking up"" and the insidiousness of a culture where even those who are supposed to protect the employees have been twisted to do just the opposite.In the end, what makes this movie bearable is the fact that the amazing Julia Garner (OZARK) is the star. Her character in Ozark is loud, brash, foul-mouthed and not afraid of much. Here, she's quiet and cowed. All her emotion is kept beneath the surface, but it's a true pleasure to watch how much Garner can convey by doing almost nothing. Watching her eat a sandwich at the deli, with scarcely a change of expression, she somehow renders powerful and resonant. This movie required a particularly committed and intelligent performance, and Garner really delivers.It's a tough movie, even so, and although I consider myself a very patient movie-goer, I still was tempted to shout ""Please let something happen!!!"". But I think it's an important film and it's approach to its subject is both infuriating and very brave. I think it's certainly worth a look...even just to see Garner in action.",The Assistant
64,Harry_Gleeson,Was Expecting More..,4,2 September 2020,"Pros:Julia Garner's performance was amazing I thought. Her potential as an actress shines through and yes, there was little dialogue with her character but she fully encapsulated her role as Jane. Very realistic in how women are frowned upon in the workplaceThe lack of dialogue in the film, I think, just about shows us as the audience how uncomfortable those situations can feelThe tone of the film was consistent throughout. That nervous tension is always thereA great effort from director, Kitty Green. Her first proper film after doing many documentaries beforehand.Cons:I did feel as if I was waiting for something to happen. Even though we know what the film was about, I did just feel I was waiting for something.There are many repetitive scenes that appear a few times, which I thought was lazy.I did feel there was a sense of the film being a little anti-climactic. I was expecting a better ending.Overall, 'The Assistant' was a powerful look into the sexual harassment scandal that Harvey Weinstein plagued Hollywood with. Julia Garner gave a commendable performance as the lead character Jane. Her realism rubbed off on me and the little dialogue in the film ultimately spoke a thousand words. For me though, the repetitive scenes that come up are just shoe horned in for me. There was a lack of creativity when the same scenes would appear, I don't think it accelerated the plot any better. I can certainly understand the positive and negative reviews the film has received. But Julia Garner is a great actor!Quote - ""You're not his type"" - MaxScore - 2.5/5",The Assistant

Take a movie like Bombshell, sap out all of the drama, politics, and ""big moments,"" and narrow the focus to the singular, almost real-time perspective of the affected employee over the course of a single workday and you have some idea of what this movie offers. The degree to which it's able to capture the sense of internal conflict and isolation of its protagonist is admirable, and it builds (very slowly) to an affecting conclusion.

67,filmtravel101,The Pathetic life of an Assistant - next film The Janitor. Terrible script!,2,4 May 2020,This film had a lot of potential and the director did a superb job of trying to keep it interesting with the trite script. It is obvious this is a lame attempt to portray a day in the life of a Harvey Weinstein or other deranged Producers - but it fails miserably. Instead it makes Garner look like a delusional pathetic dull personality that has nothing else going on in her life except to be concerned about supposedly alluded to sexual predatory behavior of her boss. But she has no valid proof after only 5 weeks of working as his Assistant. The 2 women I watched the film with also agreed that this was such a lame attempt at such a sensitive subject matter that it should never have been made or at least re written with some substance instead of just insinuations throughout the film. Plus Garner is always in the same exact outfit with pink top and short pants. Could the film not afford to buy her more than one outfit. If you really want to watch endless drawn out meticulously filmed details of what an Assistant does all day then you might feel an ounce of sympathy for the main character who basically is a slave to her job. It would have had more impact if she simply quit the job in the first 30 minutes and end of the short film. Instead it just drags and drags on and ends in the same manner. A waste of time and anyone that tries to write some high profile review like this is a masterpiece that is a day in the life of Hollywood is truly pathetic. What is next.. The Janitor? The driver? Has Hollywood gotten so desperate that this is the type of films female directors want to make to put a mark in their career. Great job directing.. please find a better script next time.

It was about halfway thru I realized the point of the movie, missed a lot of details in the beginning. I think they could have given the main woman a littttle more personality, or made her slightly more attractive (she is an attractive girl- but they made her very dowdy, I'm sure that was intentional almost as if she doesn't want to try too hard in fear she could become a target of her boss, or maybe she just isn't supposed to have that style who knows, but imo just as attractive as the girls who her boss was abusing his power with- just not made-up or hair done & plain clothes....anyway after the movie was over it leaves u very depressed realizing people make fun of the me too movement but w/o women sticking together there's not a damn thing you can do really- she was n fear of her job, a very good job n a career she wants, basically told in no uncertain terms keep your mouth shut or you're gone! So much is unsaid but you know they say the women are adults with choices but you know this man is giving them a hard choice, sexual harassment or no career....not to mention imo an 18 year old or close to it isn't really a full adult not when they r up against a middle age man of power in the entertainment industry who can say anything it's really sad :(",The Assistant

In this, she plays the eponymous ""assistant"" to a demanding and abusive boss in the movie production industry, and it's clear that a lot of her time is spent facilitating his ""casting couch"". She's obviously miserable with this life, but sticks with it because she thinks it might be a path to bigger and better things. That's it. That's the movie. It's a hour and a half of setup, followed by credits. It's just an unhappy day in the life of a very unhappy person.I went back and re-watched the trailer, and they were definitely selling a different movie. They even had the audacity to call it a ""thriller"" and gave the impression it actually had a plot.Of course it's meant to be a commentary on the movie business and people like Harvey Weinstien, but it doesn't really bring anything new to the table.I also got extremely annoyed by the sound mixing. A lot of it was done Robert Altman style, with multiple people talking at once, and occasionally someone in the background says something significant. We had to turn the volume way up to not miss anything, which made everything else (papers rustling, phones ringing, scanner scanning, etc) totally deafening.It got a 91% from critics because critics *love* ""insider"" movies about the industry, but maybe pay more attention to the 25% rating from audiences.In the end, I gave it two stars instead of one because it made a few clever choices, like never actually showing the boss, but I still consider it an hour and a half of my life I won't get back.",The Assistant

That said, the way the story is told is so detached from the characters that the point it makes is only that-a point: ""This is how things really are in any business that involves a few men (usually) with a s___load of money and an equally intimidating amount of power"". Gee, I didn't know that. And I certainly didn't know that I would be spending most of the running time of the film listening to silence. Almost no dialogue to speak of, no action at all, unless you count a paper jam in the copier. That's about as rollicking as it gets. About 40 minutes of silence, ten minutes of actual dialogue, then another 30-odd minutes of silence. Is that necessarily bad? IF we were watching a climber's hands and feet inching her up a sheer rock cliff, it could work fine. If the story were Chushingura, the 47 Samurai, this structure could work. Here, instead, nothing happens, then something happens, then we go back to nothing happening again, but with a bit more knowledge of why it isn't happening.

She may disagree with the way someone lives their life but what gives her the right to judge others. She literally has contempt for the women she supposedly wants to ""help"". I think the HR guy was right, she had nothing.If she is disillusioned with her career choice she should do something else. All the people in this film are adults who make their own choices. The lead character has no say in how they run their lives. She is not the moral arbiter, neither is the writer director.She had the opportunity to talk to her mom but decided not to, her father also asked about her welfare and she declined to say anything. She is complicit in this, maybe she suffers from guilt and fear. As far as her moralising goes it's none of her business.Basically her boss is teaching her to harden the f'up, the world owes her nothing, lesson learned.",The Assistant

Green's meticulous study of US corporate mentality shows up the office lab-rats for the insipid, closet schmucks of their own making. It reminded me of that little masterpiece Compliance (2012, Craig Zobel) and not least In the Company of Men (1997, Neil LaBute), both horror films of sorts. One of the underlying themes is glacial non-communication, sometimes deliberate, exemplified by the robotic manipulative HR guy, himself a victim of the system, a rat cornered (by the way, a fine piece of acting that takes smarminess to new heights). Will someone please count the times we hear the expression ""okay""? The concluding scene as she sits in a diner and calls her father to wish him happy birthday throws into stark relief the abyss of generational understanding: the world of employment today is anything but okay. Perhaps worse than her multilayered abuse in the workplace was the inane response of her father: Stop your trite platitudes Dad, and listen, listen to your daughter's voice. Listen.",The Assistant
87,michaeldoud,First Hit: There is no coincidence that this film is out during the Harvey Weinstein trial.,9,15 February 2020,"First Hit: There is no coincidence that this film is out during the Harvey Weinstein trial.This is a powerful film for numerous reasons. The most compelling aspect for me was that we never see the studio head, the person who has everyone in the story intimidated and contrite towards him. It is an essential and scary message. Another reason is that we are reading about Weinstein's trial in the newspaper for the past week, and he's been accused of doing just what this film is about. Then there is the way this film uses the unspoken issue about predatory sexual behavior to intimidate, coerce, and manipulate people.The story begins by following Jane (Julia Garner), assistant to the studio head, from her early morning ritual of leaving her apartment and going to the office in downtown New York City. Entering the office, she's the first one there. She prepares, prints, and distributes reports. Then she turns on the lights on the rest of the floor and goes to the boss's office to clean up after him. It includes picking up an earring, wiping crumbs and stuff on the desk, and tellingly, cleaning off stains that are on the couch, which we suspect to be from a sexual encounter.As the story moves on, other office workers arrive, they all carry an air of fear, afraid of doing something wrong, and we hear mumbled raised voices coming from behind the closed office door of the boss.Phone calls are taken, plans rearranged, people don't smile. Jane gets routed a call from the boss's wife, who complains that her credit cards won't work, gets angry at Jane's attempt to placate her, and hangs up. The boss calls Jane and yells at her. The audience barely hears the mumbled yelling on the phone call. Jane's response is to type an email to her boss stating that she is sorry and it will never happen again.This type of intimidation is the theme throughout the film.The climax of Jane's concern is when she escorts a ""new assistant,"" Sienna (Kristine Froseth), to a posh hotel. Sienna tells Jane that she was waitressing in Boise, Idaho when the boss told her she should come to NYC and become one of his assistants. We then learn that the boss leaves the office to visit Sienna at the hotel. When Jane takes her concern that the boss is misbehaving to the head of Human Resources, she once again gets intimidated. Inappropriate sex by the boss is never said but implied, and, as a final insult, Jane is told, ""she's not the boss's type.""The way this film is shot, it almost feels voyeuristic. We don't see the boss. We only follow Jane. We carefully watch her actions, and all the conversations she has on the phone are muffled, barely audible. When the door is closed and the boss is yelling, we hear some of the swear words and when the boss is with a woman, we hear muffled laughter and other noises.Garner is phenomenal. The way she internalizes her fear, her sadness, and disdain is expressed to the audience with subtle mouth movements and very expressive eyes. Everyone else is strong in their roles, but their characters are minor and don't warrant a mention here. Kitty Green wrote and directed this excellent portrayal of intimidation and predatory sexual abuse.Overall: The impact of seeing this film stayed with me through the next day.",The Assistant

Julia Garner plays Jane, the assistant and Northwestern grad who is appreciated only for being a doormat and not for her mental acumen. While her performance is honest in its portrayal of depression and the fight to climb the ladder, I felt that she lacked depth, interest, and dramatic range. Too often I felt that I was simply watching candid footage and not acting.I understood writer and director Kitty Green's stylistic choices in her latest work. I genuinely knew why she chose not to include music or any camera movement, deferring to simply use a stationary camera. The barebones approach supported the feelings of being trapped, depressed, and alone in a business that is only there to get what they want out of you. But movies, while thought provoking and impactful, are supposed to be entertaining. The audience should not have to struggle to follow the plot or constantly remind themselves that ""even though there isn't a real story here, it is important that I watch and understand.""On the positive side of things, The Assistant is a very real reflection of the abuse many women face inside the entertainment industry and in politics. Years removed from the first talks on gender equality, there still remains the shell of the working world's infrastructure that allows for misogyny and sexual harassment. For this reason, I would suggest you watch the movie only to gain perspective, not to learn more about good filmmaking.",The Assistant

For the first 48 minutes, we are inside an office looking at Julia making phone calls, photocopies, cleaning up, distributing mail, ordering food etc. The thrill of watching grass grow. Then she goes to some manager to tell about a young, ""very pretty"" girl, a waitress, who came from Idaho to be an assistant. She is put up in a fancy hotel and apparently The Boss goes there. That is all we get. Of course there is a reference to harassment, but nothing is made clear as to why this girl came out of free will from Idaho. We get to know neither the girl nor The Boss and it is just left to our fantasies to make something out of this. Then it goes back to office work and finally a phone call to her dad in a diner.

111,BornKnight,Good Atmosphere Without So Much Development,6,30 May 2020,"""The Assistant"" (2019, 3311 Productions) is a drama directed and written by Kitty Green (Casting Jon Benet, The Face of Ukraine: Casting Oksana Baiul and Ukraine Is Not a Brothel), a director who began her career after hearing about the Weinsten scandal (of harassment in the cinema industry) and using this theme for her films and to bring the subject to the light.The story of the film focuses a day of work of Jane (Julia Gardner), a recent graduate who aspires to work one day as a film producer and accepts the job as a producer's assistant, following a routine from dawn to night, of tidying up every task, cleaning up, organizing things and other chores. After some time on the job, she begins to notice strange things, like girls who visit her boss and to suspect about harassment and sexual abuse, a taboo subject put under the covers even by other employees. And she decides to try to bring it up. The film has a whole oppressive and heavy air, most of it being silent, with the exception in the dialogue parts, that are always in a low tone.In the cast the base of the movie is on the acting of Julia Garner (Ozark, Perks of Being a Wallflower, Mabiac, Sin City: A Dame to Kill For), who practically appears in all the scenes, beside some supporting actors and characters that appear from time to time. She acts very well, passing the feeling of oppression of the environment, with its secrets muffled by all. The cinematography is by Michael Latham (Ukraine is Not a Brothel, Island of Hungry Ghosts) who works well in the shots indoors with a use of muted and depressive tones often gray, brown and bluish, apart from the use of shadows the whole film. The musical score is composed by Tamar-kali (Mudbound, Shirley), which is effective in the film, but very subtle, with the track being usually composed of bass and continuous tones. The dialogues are well done with the voices of the actors always discreet and the presence of phone calls always very low, but discernible in the background.Conclusion: the movie has a good production in photography, dialogue and especially acting, but the script lacks a little, despite the strong theme, being a bit monotonous, without reaching a conclusion in the story, just a description without effect. I would give a 6.0 / 10.0 score for the film as drama (but a 7,0 for the nice production and acting).",The Assistant

The pace is deliberately slow (to the extreme), but the tension remains present in each and every scene (also - to the extreme). I think this movie is exactly what it was planned to be - an experience rather than a story. In my opinion - it's all about immersion here.Great, cristally sharp cinematography, focused on protagonist's eyes, blurring all the unnecessary stuff out, portraying Jane's loneliness in the crowd of ethic-zombies, giving us a fair look into her fragile, naive soul.Fantastic casting in all the main and supporting roles, aware of the ugly truth that sometimes it's just all about 'a type' of person, rather than 'a portrait'. Those 'people' characters - so random, so usual, yet so frightening in their will to survive and so repulsive in their egocentrism - are for me the second topic of the movie, and partially the reason why the pathology the movie depicts prevails so long.Excellent staging which draws a crude, nonchalant, invisible circle around Jane, cruelly excluding her from the big world of big stuff. The great, yet so simple, idea for 'depicting' Jane's mythical Boss is also quite interesting as a form of keeping the tension and, basically (maybe?), as a way of pointing an invisible finger at some particularly known for his bad reputation real-life movie producer.Superb acting by Julia Garner, which makes Jane a believable 'wanna-be-producer', not assertive enough, conflicted on the axis of 'to be' vs 'to gain', leaving us with heartbreaking compassion for her snowflake nature.And there is this smart sound design - focused around Jane's ears, forwarding to us all of this 'jungle's' audial bits and pieces which happens to be part of her experience in those random moments of her daily work routine. This is very powerful, yet - again - so simple way of making every little half-word around Jane seemingly irrelevant and same time potentially threatening. This sound design is Julia Garner's best friend - as it deepens her emotional acting, adds a context for it.Even costumes are perfect. With a small exception maybe for those Jane's undersized pants - as a visual clue, they are just... too obvious.And all of this, all of those production parts gems - somehow wasted on behalf of this strange assumption that such a movie could be interesting enough to make us stay in the chair for one and half hour. I get the idea and the high morals behind it. I get it. I even admire the bravery to make such bold movie statement as a creator. But it's boring. It's unfulfilled promise. It's a hoax a bit.Maybe there is a mistake in advertising? Maybe it should be marketed as a kind of mockumentary, or 'based on a true story' type of thing, instead of as a 'thriller'?

For me it was heartwrenching, watching a young woman with hopes of being a film producer as she comes to terms with the misogyny inherent in her business. Her coveted job is mundane and demeaning, her boss is abusive and her office mates get her attention by throwing wads of paper at her, not even able to say her name.Yet there is an arc to the minimalist plot. She sees more than one woman escorted in to her boss's office followed by muffled laughter and what we can imagine. When one particularly young woman becomes part of the pack, the assistant is moved to act, going to HR, for what is probably a familiar conversation for many women.The dialogue is minimal, the office is bleak, and Julia Garner carries this film brilliantly, with all emotions flitting across her face.If you are someone who prefers action movies and superheroes, this is not a movie for you. If you are a woman who has had an entry level job in any male-dominated business in NYC, this movie will speak volumes to you. (The detail of the paper getting stuck in the copier brought back memories of standing endlessly at those cursed machines.)

Her parents are also proud of her job. The film shows the day's work of the female assistant, from leaving home in the early morning to returning home at night. Although trivial, it really reflects the hard work of the bottom assistant and the hidden rules of the whole environment. However, she is greedy for work every day, even doing cleaning work. There is no one in the office who respects and appreciates her efforts, and almost no one is looking at her. The film also shows for the first time the hard work of a junior assistant in a Hollywood company.
This is not news in fact. Many years ago, there were books about Hollywood assistant survival guide! Most of the assistants, male and female, were very humble at the beginning. Most of their work had nothing to do with the production, such as copying, answering the phone, serving tea and water, helping the boss to buy lunch, booking air tickets, reimbursements, and getting dry cleaned clothes... I also did these during my internship. However, since a lot of big directors and big producers started in this way, many young people also bear no grudge.
The female assistant in this movie doesn't complain about doing this, but she slowly finds that there are young and beautiful girls going in and out of the office or being arranged to go to the hotel. She also helps to deal with the questioning from the boss's wife. Even the whole company knows the boss's behavior. Instead of complaining, they tease the girls together. They are used to it. They even help him arrange the girls and do everything.
Because the girl is also a new assistant. Like the audience, she is curious about everything, and gradually opens Pandora's box with the audience. The smoke inside makes her suffocate for many times. But if you go to HR, you will be threatened and your bright future will be destroyed as much as possible. Before leaving, HR said: ""don't worry, you are not his dish."" As comfort.
Most interestingly, every time Weinstein criticizes her, she needs to write a letter to apologize. And Weinstein would boast that she was smart. It seems that lustful bosses also have reason. Although there are many beauties, they always need to find someone who really does the work, and they also need to be aware of the overall situation. And the girl with excellent academic background and eager to succeed, who came to New York from a small city, just met the requirements.
This film is written by assistant Weinstein after the rabbit movement. I personally think most of the content is authentic, which greatly satisfies the audience's curiosity about Weinstein. After all, directly from the perspective of the victim, it is often regarded as biased. It is better to be more objective from the perspective of his closest neighbors. The female assistant can only be silent though she sees everything in her eyes. There is no dialogue for a lot of time in the film. Only the sound of the copier and the phone ring show why we have waited so long to hear the truth: countless small people who pursue their career as individuals have given up their principles because of their ideals and have to bow to the power... Until one person after another came forward.
The film successfully plays up a kind of horror atmosphere. The color of the whole film is gray and lifeless. In the dialogue outside the silence, it is mostly insulting and belittling to people. It successfully creates a toxic environment, and there seems to be no good person. Weinstein's shouting at his subordinates and belittling them with offensive words are also often heard in the film. This verbal violence is one of his hallmarks. Although there was no violent content, the female assistant was obviously frightened by the surrounding environment, and often saw her swallowing saliva, not daring to look at the people around her.
After watching this film, you will surely think that anheithway's female assistant in ""the Devil Wears Prada"" was just too happy.
However, the presentation of the film may occasionally be boring and lack of commercial attraction in the eyes of the public. After all, watching her clean the room, wash the dishes and copy for a long time, I really feel that it is not as interesting as the fast-paced and dramatic narrative way of ""bombshell"", so I just quit the award season and released it in January. But what the film tells us is really not to be missed. That said, even if you look for a big star, shooting like ""Bob shell"" can still be controversial. Such sex abuse movies are actually very difficult at present, but they are also very important. The main reason is that things have just happened, but I believe that there will be more and more similar films in the future, and I hope that there will be more sharp and sharp perspectives with different angles.",The Assistant
127,pbenen,Unrealistic,5,25 July 2020,"Not as boring as many reviews, but probably not to representative of many offices in today's environment - maybe a Weinstein's, but if someone actually knows this, then that someone was also willingly in that environment.Hopefully a graduate from Northwestern wouldn't refer to a good hotel using Beverly Hillbilly speak ""fancy hotel"".

128,JSplend954,Cure for Insomnia,1,3 May 2020,"Plain and simple - this movie will put you to sleep. This is not a fast paced movie. It drags and drags and drags. The most exciting parts of the movie - having a paper jam in the copier, watching a frozen dinner spin around the microwave, organizing paper clips and rubber bands in a desk drawer, I'm not exaggerating . There was no conversation, just chattering, hearing the chime from a text message, hearing an elevator door open. It seems like the story was based on a chauvinistic boss , who we never see, but was probably a jerk. But it didn't go anywhere. What did I learn from the movie - If your using the company's landline phone, you have to dial 9 1 then the number to make an outside call - Oh and how to use a speed dial. I honestly cannot see how anyone would actually enjoy watching this movie. It was less than 90 minutes long but it felt like you were watching the movie the whole day. Probably because it detailed the worker's routine from the time she started her work day until the time she finished. One reviewer wrote if you thought the movie was boring your missing the point. When I watch a movie, I'm hoping that it keeps my interest.

Well I didn't quite give it a 10, but I do rate it very highly. And it's not the first movie I've ever seen. In fact I've seen many movies in my life, and I've come to realize that there are many different types of movies. This is solely a character study movie. You have to go into it with different expectations than you would an action movie, a comedy, or a crime drama. Julia Garner's character, Jane, is the sole focus of this movie. You are watching how she handles a day of work at a job about which she is deeply conflicted. And for those reviewers who say this movie has no plot, I don't think you really thought much about what you were watching. This wasn't just any day of work for Jane. The plot of the movie is that this is the day Jane decides whether she wanted her job enough to put up with her creep of a boss.

137,slackline70,What to expect from this movie,7,9 May 2020,"First off, this movie does make a number of thinly veiled references to Harvey Weinstein.However, do not expect to see much of Harvey in this movie.Do not expect a sort of 'Harvey Dearest' exploitation piece with wall-to-wall scenes of a movie executive who is obviously supposed to be Harvey Weinstein abusing and raping employees left and right.Additionally, do not expect something along the lines of 'All the President's Men' or 'Erin Brockovich' in which a plucky young heroine brings down a powerful but very corrupt individual.What you can expect is to see a very accurate depiction of a typical day of a typical employee amidst the silent chaos of someone like Harvey Weinstein's reign of terror.Finally, you can expect a very competent answer to the question of exactly how individuals such as Weinstein and Bill Cosby got away with what they did for as long as they did.I mean - didn't anyone know?Well, The Assistant answers this question - with relentless presentation over exposition: they didn't get away with it because no one knew; they got away with it because EVERYONE knew. And anyone who has been witness to this sort of thing knows that's exactly how it happens. The behavior simply becomes part of every day life in the organization, and from thereon no one will say anything because the entire organization becomes an extension of the boss's behavior.It's not a fun movie - but it is an honest one.",The Assistant

139,RoadSideAssistance,This is a giant 90 minute movie of nothing happens...,2,5 October 2020,"I must say the acting by the main character was pretty good. It's a story about a girl that accepts an executive secretary position at a movie production Company. This is quite a demanding job actually having known several in my time, and because the meetings are so important along with demands from the Executive, there's little mistakes you can make (but that's also the same WHENEVER you're supporting anything that goes to an exec - that's not just a secretary job).In any event, she's super awkward the whole movie, and then a hot girl shows up and she suspects he's banging this girl who worked as a waitress. She acts the WHOLE movie like something happened to her, but we're never really given any info. if it did? So it's like watching cardboard act the whole movie. A much better movie was Kristen Stewart's ""Silence"" where a traumatic event happens and then a fun loving girl becomes withdrawn.You keep WAITING for something to happen, for the plot to thicken, and it NEVER does. When she goes to HR she has little to no factual information and let me tell you working for a VERY pro female Company... taking a complaint to HR is EXTREMELY serious. You better have facts, you better have legit cause, and not assumptions that someone is fooling around.This screams MeToo# liberal trash. There's several times where the men in the office are giving her looks like they're going to throw her out the window, or sabotaging her with 'mean angry wife' calls, while the women in the office are passive and at the end one says: ""Don't worry, she'll gain more from it then he will.""

At least, in ""Prada,"" we see a developing arc in Andy's character--from condescension to mania to dismissal. In this flick, the ""assistant"" is disgruntled & jaded from her pre-dawn start to her day to the very end. Her character remains static like an EKG flatline from beginning to end. And what should have been a dramatic clincher in the film--her confession to Human Resources about her boss--ends up being (justifiably) hearsay, thereby muting the very real toxic environment that her character is supposed to be revealing!

147,Digital_excitation,An office story about dubious behavior,8,7 December 2020,"The story is about Jane, a young woman, a junior assistant of someone in the movie-business, one of the first steps up the ladder. What her boss's actual status within the office is is unknown but he's high up. He has a reputation, screwing around with women of all sorts. His assistants know, colleagues know, his wife knows, everybody seems to know. Little hints are given through her work: boxes of Viagra being delivered, checks without name being issued, finding an earring on the ground near the couch in his office, arranging a hotel-room for a new assistant that flew across the continent to work at his office but doing absolutely nothing, has no experience in the business and looks barely 20. Everything is hush hush, but things just don't feel right. People talk, but no one complains, and they have good reason to.But Jane decides to file a complaint about his dubious actions. At that moment I thought: What can she actually complain about? It's not her he's after, she's not being harassed, it's not hindering her work and the persons involved aren't complaining either. You could argue that he's using company money to pay for his affairs, but that would be an internal (tax?) problem. So why would it be her place to file that complaint if it isn't happening to her, and how is she going to prove this if the victims (if you can call them that, they seem to have 'paid arrangements') don't come forward? It is exactly what the person says that she files the complaint with: 'What exactly is your complaint?' He summarizes it and indeed, it 's pretty weak. It's suspicion and hearsay if those directly involved don't come forward. He does then add that if he wants to keep working there, she should just ignore it... Someone later says to Jane: 'Don't worry. She'll get more out of it than he will' hinting that he's more talk then action (or she's talking about his wife, not sure)It's an old story: The boss screwing the secretary, the office workers flirting with them or actually harassing them, most of the female workers either ignoring them or complain about them, and some that just use it to quickly get what they want to rise the ranks. Yes, you have those persons too: In Belgium they even have a specific word for it, that roughly translates as 'upscrewing' (yeah, I read too many weird articles).It's good to see a good scripted movie about this, that quite specifically shows how difficult it is to handle these issues.",The Assistant

This is a movie about social awareness and human rights. If the movie industry would have a proper label for these movies it would attract the correct interested viewers and not waste people's time who are merely looking for entertainment. This movie is in no way for entertainment; It is a statement piece. It is very well done and very well acted.
It is to make you understand and feel a lifetime's worth (or at least years worth) of choices and experiences that are all too real and this film does extremely well at making that felt as a reality in it's brief time frame.
Second, this film delivers a statement that anyone who considers employment (not only in this particular industry) today, must be prepared and aware to face the world in it's real form and know where your place will be within it's influence. Will you accept it and succeed or fight it and struggle to be okay within. It is a struggle of conscience and survival... at what cost will you turn the other way; At what cost will you be okay to fit in and not rock the boat.
Last, it is very well done and performed and I give tremendous props from myself and on behalf of those who do not understand (with apologies) and those who leave no proper labeling for this film.

152,choonmixer95,A study in just how powerful abusive executives get away with it,8,14 May 2020,"There are so many negative reviews on here that I felt compelled to try and redress the balance a little.This isn't the best movie of the year by any means but it is a powerful explanation of just how executives like the Weinsteins of this world are able to get away with predadtory sexual behaviour and other exploitative and sometimes abusive and bullying behaviour.I thought the lack of dialogue and the physical absence of the abusive and powerful studio head throughout the movie was extremely effective. The fact that the movie was shot in a such a way that everything was seen from the point of view of the main character and most of the sparse dialogue was overheard from other conversations. Where there was direct dialogue, it served to highlight the way in which everyone tiptoed around sensitive topics for fear of incurring repercussions. The central character spends her day 'tidying up' for the boss. Trying not to be implicated in the boss's misbehaviour when confronted by the wife; trying to avoid any form of complicity in the facilitation of the new assistant; clearing up the detritus of his sexual behaviour and stocking up his drugs cupboard for future 'appointments' with aspiring actresses. The paucity of the dialogue and the miserableness of everyone's existence is the whole point. The threat of losing their jobs is causing most to bury any concerns they may have out of self interest but you can see the main character tearing herself apart in trying to decide whether to carry on. The final phonecall with her father and his statement that every new job is difficult to begin with does nothing to leave the viewer with any certainty of how it will end when she walks off down the street.Will she be back tomorrow as the new assistant suggested earlier or is that walk down the street a symbol of her leaving the abuse behind her. We are meant to be left in doubt. What would we do?I can't believe so many reviewers on here seem to have completely missed the point of this movie in my opinion. One even suggested it should have been called ""The Jealous Assistant"" echoing the words of the Head of HR and in so doing seems to have totally missed the point of what this movie is trying to say.For me it was an excellent response to all those who said when talking about Weinstein - ""but how could he get away with it undetected"" or ""didn't anyone in the company notice"" or ""why didn't anyone speak up"". This movie suggests that a culture of intimidation and bullying is all it takes when everyone wants to keep their jobs. Simple as that.",The Assistant

It asks the viewer to play attention and focus on certain things each character says. This movie definitely isn't for everyone and many people would probably find this boring. I for one think it's brilliant and must be viewed with an open mind and no expectations. I would recommend this to anyone who appreciates small scale, dialog driven, indie dramas.

There's not much I can say about this film because it really does just take a look at how her day goes from leaving work to leaving work.As we watch Jane's day, you see the type of things she has to deal with from being unappreciated, being left out by her coworkers, having to deal with verbal abuse, etc. As you watch this, it'll feel very real even if you don't experience it or see it yourself. Even how she deals with it feels very realistic in the world we live in today.Just a heads up, this is a very slow movie because you're just watching Jane's day go by. It's one of those movies with long shots where the camera is usually just set in one place for a whole scene. It's not a thrilling or that engaging of a film, but it is interesting. I would say it picks up a little more halfway through but not much. You just gotta have that expectation before going into the movie.This film isn't for everyone, but if you're somewhat interested after reading this, I say give it a try. It's only about an hour and a half, so it won't take up much of your time. It tackles real life issues while making it still feel real.

It makes such a change to see a film that treats the intelligence of its' audience with respect and does not use excessive noise, on-screen graphics, cast members breaking the ""fourth wall"" and talking directly to the audience and all the other devices directors use who treat their audience as a bunch of dimwits.
Thankfully, Kitty Green knows how to use silence to make painful points and she has found a superb conduit in Julia Garner's face and body language to show how damaging it is for a young person with ambitious dreams to take that first step on the employment ladder.
Much has been made of the film's setting in the ""film"" business and that the main character is female - associations with the ""Weinstein business"" have been bandied about by various reviewers - but there are anecdotes out there that this toxicity is out there in other industries - retailing, advertising, ""media"", - and affects males as well. Predators are not exclusively male. I think it is a sad reflection on our society that the young are so viscerally exploited, even to the extent of not paying them and selling them the dubious notion that they are ""gaining experience at a significant cost to the company"" when, in fact, the truth is a ""dogsbody"" is needed for the menial tasks and paying them would impact the bottom line.
Garner plays one of these ""exploited"" brilliantly. She is well-educated but accepts that to get her ""dream"" job she has to start at the bottom.The only time when her ambition breaks through the carapace she has had to adopt in order to deal with the banality of her job is when she is asked by the HR Manager, where she wants to be in"" 5,10 years time"" and you can see the light still burning in her eyes. What a performance - here is a star in the making.
I've not given the film a 10* simply because I was not convinced by her decision-making in the section dealing with her meeting with the HR manager played by Matthew Macfadyen. Some critics have said that his performance is indicative of a ""turn a blind eye"" to a situation where a sexual predator is lining up their next victim and Human Resources does nothing about it. I am sure that many representatives of that profession would respond that the episode perfectly encapsulates the difficulties they face when having to deal with accusations where the accuser cannot offer substance to the allegations they are making. Personally, I thought that Garner's character was exhibiting a preemptive strike against a rival for her role in the office who was taken on because of her ""innocence"" and ""attractiveness"",(or,possibly, Kitty Green holds a grudge against the people of Boysie, Idaho).Maybe this is the first example of her putting into practice what working there has taught her.
And if there is an award out there for the best ""voice"" performance of the year, then that should go to, reportedly, Jay O. Saunders, because he manages to imbue the off-screen presence of ""The Boss"" with such menace that it is no surprise that ""fear"" is the management skill in action here, not ""constructive criticism"".",The Assistant

The suffocating atmosphere to which the main lead finds herself in is nauseating. Watching this film one feels as soiled as those starring in it. The toxicity present is disturbing.
Did any of the low rating reviews notice the erectile dysfunction drug she was stocking up on for her boss? The syringes? The hostility and fear? The toxicity? No... this is why we have had historic issues of abuse in the workplace.

A partnership or a place on the exec team perhaps but you'll never be a bonafide movie star. You'll never make movies or produce them or work in the glamour of Hollywood and this means the boss of a normal firm can rarely behave like a top showbiz producer. The average firm isn't run like this.There must be so many skeletons in Hollywood and so many people got stepped on or did the stepping to get to where they are. The lead in this film for example starts at the bottom enduring the horrors of her boss just so might have a hope of a big job in future. Sure she might get it but she'll carry the weight of the pain of what she saw and heard with her.On her deathbed in her huge mansion she might even ask if it was all worth it.

175,robinhoodfilms,Failed on (almost) every level.,1,9 October 2020,"The greatest thing about this film is that is serves as an excellent cautionary tale for aspiring filmmakers.From a creative standpoint, the acting is excellent. That is the only good element of the movie, which is frustrating. The timing for a film on this subject is perfect, yet it misses the mark in every possible way.Within the first ten minutes I came to the conclusion that the filmmaker had never make a movie before. Turns out, I was close. Her background is in documentaries. I will confess, I've never seen a documentary as boring as this movie.I'm almost compelled to go back and count up what percentage of the film is the lead character doing, essentially, NOTHING. By that I mean, walking, cleaning the office, stocking supplies, eating, opening mail, making phone calls, etc. You may think I'm exaggerating. I'm not. It's painful.My next conclusion was that the director must also be the editor, because only someone that close to the project couldn't see how badly the fat needed to be cut. It turns out, I was right on that front, but not 100%. At a svelte 87 minutes, it seems there was no movie there to begin with and every boring piece had to be included to make a feature-length running time.I'll express again - there is no real story here. It goes nowhere. This was a short film that somehow got made into a feature to disastrous effect. And the frustrating thing is - there could have been a movie, a good movie here. The 87 minutes could have easily been compressed into a solid first act. Seriously.I've seen some good reviews for the film and have to admit that my impression is that the subject matter is what got this project almost all of its favorable responses. Yet just calling attention to something important and/or timely doesn't excuse poor storytelling or lack of talent.My recommendation is - watch the trailer and you've seen the whole film.",The Assistant

190,sara_shaw,A Composed and Measured Topical Movie,7,23 February 2020,"""The Assistant"" is compelling because it is not a scandalous rehash- it's a day-in-the-life-of. This is a carefully calibrated film with a tight script and great editing- image and sound. A strong, subtle performance by Julia Garner. Her face is riveting in that great actor way of conveying a lot without chewing the scenery. You might think this kind of stripped-down procedural style might be boring, but it's not here- the supporting characters aren't much but they convey exactly what they're supposed to- ciphers in the best theatrical sense. The only real criticism could be that things kind of fly by without explanation- granted, this is to convey a sense of her busyness and the tedium of it, but there are times when you're not quite sure what's what. Thankfully, though, the significant, thematic moments are not among these. It's a tightrope throughout and in lesser hands would be kind of a disaster. Here, it's interesting- Altman-like in that '70's style.All in all, the kind of topical movie that's a breath of fresh air- not overwrought and from a pulpit. Still, an incisive portrayal, a kind of death-by-a-thousand-cuts depiction of a disturbing normality. Recommended for fans of thoughtful indie films- this is not a thriller or a plot-based narrative, so don't worry if you forget to buy popcorn before it starts.",The Assistant

But I'm deeply impressed by her artistry with the script, direction and editing of this film. It's a quietly devastating story, told with quietly devastating restraint. Every little detail is pitch perfect. The greater conceit captivates for its unique angle on story craft - a tale of power and abuse from the intimate-yet-marginal perspective of a young assistant to an invisible yet all-intimidating boss with dark patterns of abuse. Her de-valued point of view and his invisibility, with the self-interested complicity of every other employee in the production company, hits you like a body blow. It's a story about everyday human degradations. No one comes out clean. Perhaps that's why this has a relatively low rating on par with Batman vs. Superman, though this film surely has far greater artistry, thoughtfulness and meaning.

202,cyranomish,The Wonderful World of Work.,9,22 February 2020,"With or without the Weinstein scandal, this is an important and very grown-up film. It's not about Weinstein types. It's about people who work with them. Meet Jane. Plain Jane, every-working-stiff Jane, Jane Eyre observing society's high-rollers from the relative safety of the sidelines.
I knew this was a story about my world from the opening moments when Jane climbs into a taxi to go to work extra early and get off to a solid start in the career of her choice, no matter how mundane/sordid some of her tasks might be.
I love the warm, buttery light in those office interiors as Jane goes about reading the mail, preparing coffee; like the light in one of Vermeer's Dutch Interior paintings. With her melancholy, watchful eyes and her long, sensitive face, Jane resembles the mysterious girl in Vermeer's famous portrait of a veiled young ""Girl in a Pearl Necklace."" (Vermeer's model rumored to have been his own daughter, an accomplished artist in her own right, and her father's right-hand assistant.)
Mysterious Mr. Big -- who is never seen -- is like the weather: Is it going to be a sunny day or an arctic blast? Who knows? How Jane deals with today's weather is the question. Doesn't matter whether Mr. Big is big in law, government, media, etc. Jane's two office mates are sometimes infuriating, sometimes hilarious watching to see how she'll handle the same curve balls that Mr. Big has been firing at them for a long time.
Jane gets unnerved when a younger, prettier assistant moves into the desk across from hers. Are Jane's days numbered? Is her subsequent visit to HR due to feminist concerns? Or self-preservation? Both? It's the movie's key scene, and HR guy's parting remark is an evil gem.
This is a white collar job movie to treasure alongside The Apartment or Mad Men. If you seek a livelier, swift-moving look at the film industry, check out Robert Altman's The Player. Elegant Dina Merrill as Celia, Mr. Big's assistant, is Jane in twenty years, if she plays her cards right.

Unfortunately, the film itself descends into a pastiche of subtlety and nuance that doesn't entertain in any way.
The backdrop to the film is an overly contrived working environment laced with misogyny. Given the efforts of the filmmaker to dilute every other aspect of the film to the level of homeopathic affect, it's telling that the patriarchal environment is delivered like a double espresso.
The central premise of the film is that a female assistant is vaguely, and subsequently more acutely, aware that her boss is sexually exploiting women in his employ. Her insipid intervention in this toxic scenario is rebuffed and the film then evaporates into a morose examination of the helplessness of the female protagonist.
Ultimately the film portrays women as impotent and superfluous participants in a world overloaded with the worst vestiges of masculinity. Hence this film necessitates an amendment to the old adage; don't let the truth get in the way of a bad story.",The Assistant

Then as time went on, it dawned on us that it may be about something more, related to sexual usury. Waiting for this to be brought home the film continued in the same vein. Then it ended ?",The Assistant
210,arne-ziebell,This is a little masterpiece!,10,14 July 2020,"This movie was to me a little masterpiece. Great script and directing, and so moving acting by Julia Garner the whole way through.It's slow in it's rhythm ... just as the life and daily routine is for Jane, even though she is stressed, another quality of this movie.It deals with how men and women see, interact ... and how men use women not only sexually, but also psychologically in a big firm. But it also deals with how some women see other women.I won't make any spoilers, but pay attention to Jane's observation and ""concern"" when it comes to her boss - AND her father. That is the red thread for me through out the film.I will give this movie 12 stars out of 10",The Assistant

A beautifully masterpiece of a woman 'trying to make a living and succeed In a mans world to be pushed under a mans thumb with disgust'. Almost painful to watch. The film gives the feeling like the events took place in an older time. The phones and headsets. The old school mentality. But this still happens now. I have been Jane.

219,Katgal98,Does anyone in this office ever smile or laugh?,4,27 July 2020,"I've worked in several film production offices. Not one was as grim and silent as the one portrayed in this movie. In real life, the various production assistants, story editors, receptionists, and the lowest levels of employees TALK TO EACH OTHER. Crack jokes. Gossip. Schmooze about films and scripts in production. Usually, they knock it off as soon as The Boss is around - especially one as intimidating as the one portrayed (unseen) in the film, but it's never as joyless an environment as depicted here. What the director does get right is that haunting, New York loneliness, and the feeling of being the Outsider. But the one note tone doesn't help the film. Also, if we didn't have foreknowledge of the Weinstein case, we really wouldn't have a clue what is going on and would wonder if Jane is imagining it all. There's really no suspense. I assume that an actor as gifted and energetic as Julia Garner was directed to tone it down as much as possible. But the film seems to play the ending at the beginning. Rather than experiencing her gradual realization and dismay, the beginning is exactly the same as the ending.",The Assistant
220,katz009-1,It'll stay with you...just not in the way intended,3,11 September 2021,"Where to begin? As strictly a movie, forgetting about the social commentaries, it's arguably one of the worst I've seen. Ever. That was clear about 15 minutes in.The point being made is very clear, however there should still be some story and character development. There was none. The choice to make this simply a ""day in the life of"" movie really killed any opportunity for development and to draw the viewer in. That's a difficult enough concept to have work even with a good story, good script, and interesting characters. None of which this movie had.There's so much buzz about Gardener's performance but I fail to see how we can call it a performance. She was convincingly unhappy - not a feat of acting in any way - and had about 8 lines of dialogue. Great job! Give her an award!I guess visually it was...fine.Now, to the social commentary. The most glaring to me was the small allusion to Harvey Weinstein. Either make it more of a plot point or just leave it out. That's too big of a situation to barely make note of - and wasn't really done well anyway.As for the daily harassment, annoyances, lack of respect, sexism, etc.. My wife has been in the music business for 13 years and her first number of years as an assistant, her days were filled with these, as was the main characters. Now, there is most definitely a story to be told there, but to take such serious situations and turn them into mundane everyday occurrences was an injustice.Supposing the point was to show how these things are everyday occurrences, and to do so somewhat accurately, then that was achieved. Which is why I gave 3 stars. It's just that, like I said, as a movie it is terrible and as a way to shed light on what women face in the film, or any other, industry it was an utter failure.I believe the point for this movie was to have the social commentary points stick with you, to have the movie stay on your mind. It certainly does, but not in the intended way. It stays with you because it's hard to forget just how bad this movie really is.",The Assistant

Riding on a ''Me Too - Weinstein'' wave, tells that it's not easy to be a newcomer secretary in a movie business, if you are not beautiful, sexy, and willing to sleep with your boss (there is, if he is not willing to sleep with you). The problem is, the main character enters the story in a cold, depressive mood, and exits the movie without a single atom changed. So one asks oneself ''what was the purpose of this?''

226,mcvmunro,Excellent quiet portrait of young naive girl trying to do the right thing.,10,31 August 2020,"""The Assistant"" was very effective on showing what a person on the very bottom of the corporate structure (or the film culture) faces, the risks involved, the potential to harm to their own career, and how overwhelmingly difficult is to achieve any success to have anybody do anything about harm being done to another person, or point out that the person is being exploited. The idea of being a whistle blower when you're on the bottom of the food chain. It did a great job of identifying and exposing those very real risks and intimidation tactics that these kind of people have to deal with.This movie represents the ""Me too"" movement specifically. ""The Assistant"" wasn't blowing the whistle on corruption or someone embellishing money in the company, she was drawing attention to the fact that inocente young women were being pressured and influenced and promised things if the cooperate sexually with powerful people.That's how the ""Me too"" happens, you have women that are promised (or implied promised) that their careers are going go get busted if they go along with of being sexually available to these powerful people.And the flip side of this -and how it continues on this culture- is, that everybody around that, sees that, knows that it is happening but, because their overall concern is on their own careers and how speaking up would affect it, forces them to comply to silence.There are two things happening: there's the act of exploiting and sexually abusing inocente young naive women, extorting them, saying either ""I'll help your career if you do this"" or ""I'm going to destroy your career if you don't do this"", and the biggest reason that allows this to keep happening is because the enabling culture of everybody else in various positions from the bottom to the top that sees what's happening, know what's happening, but choose not to get involved or say anything because they are protecting their own careers.Great film. Absolutely recommend it.

228,PalmersGreek,Accurate,6,2 May 2020,"Yes, it is boring and yes, it is slow, but this is the most accurate representation I've ever seen of my time working in the media for a big US company. Putting the #metoo for aside, Kitty Green has captured the mundane and relentless demands, the false promises that lead nowhere, the meaningless praise, the bland lifeless co-workers, the repetitive printing and copying, the bullying and total lack of humanity as well as the evil of a department that treats Humans as a resource. The #metoo bit isn't something that I ever witnessed, but if you want to understand what sort of an environment would enable that behaviour and why nobody ever spoke up, this film pretty much spells it out for you. Cannot say it was an enjoyable watch, it bought back a lot of old memories of a youth lost in that awful industry, but I am pleased I watched it and I am pleased that I'm out of it.",The Assistant
229,allycox,In some ways unexpected,6,6 February 2021,"As a woman, I completely understand the struggles the main character is going though. I have had similar jobs with similar responsibilities. I feel like the movie did portray her difficulties well. I thought it was a good choice to never really show the man she worked for. I really need to remember to read descriptions of a movie as well because when I watched the trailer, I didn't feel like it showed that it was only one day in her life and so I spent a lot of the movie wondering why she was wearing the same shirt. It didn't feel like one day to me. It felt like several days. A lot happened in one day. I also didn't feel like a got a lot of back story on the character. I didn't get a lot about her as a person so that made it a little more challenging for me to really feel for her as a character. I didn't even know until half way through the movie what industry she was working in. I know what the movie was trying for, to make you come to conclusions without having to verbally explain it, but this movie did not do it that well. The acting was excellent. I like the story but I feel like it could have been told better. I also would have liked to have at least a little justice in the end, by at least her quitting her job.

290,PumpkinSeeds15,Excellent dissection of an important point,6,30 April 2020,"There are movies that entertain and movies that aim to make you think. Certainly there are movies that do both but given that this one has absolutely zero entertainment value, I would not pay to see it in the theater. Even assigning the words thriller or drama to it carries way too much action and sets up the viewer for disappointment.With that said, I think this movie does a great job of examining the insidious nature and proliferation of abuse in the work place. And not just sexual abuse because we witness many variants here. Yes, this movie can be summarized as mundane, but that's exactly the point. When a big scandal blows up we witness the culmination, the super nova, but that doesn't capture the whole ordeal. This movie is for all the people who ask how did this happen? How did Weinstein and other abusive powerful men were able to get away with the things they did for so long? This! The fact that you don't see ""the villain"" or any horrendous acts, the fact that you don't get any resolution or big conclusion, that's exactly the point. The boring uneasy ""normal"" is as much part of the abuse as the acts themselves. The every-day people who excuse and enable it or simply just look away, what role do they play? Power dynamics and our culture. I believe those are the points this movie is asking you to explore deeper and as such, I think it does an excellent job. I did not find it boring at all but the pacing is deliberately slow. So I'd recommend watch it with a friend, and maybe a coffee, and then discuss among yourselves after.",The Assistant
291,DimitraBoukouvala,Realistically dark,9,29 April 2020,"I believe this film falls under the category of polar reactions : you will absolutely love it or utterly hate it. You will have to watch it to decide. I found it very interesting as it seeks to resemble real time, one day in an office. That might seem slow to some but to me it conveyed this sense of weariness, boredom, uneasiness and claustrophobic bleakness it intended to convey. Half said, half stifled are the intimidations, the agonies and the disappointments this girl experiences. Every time the phone rings there's a muted suspense. The performances are brilliant, Julia Garner fully assumes the part and Matthew Macfadyen is definitely the congenial bully he is supposed to be, smiling but really delivering his threats to the Assistant who wants to make a complaint! It is atmospheric, dark and educational! Give it a try and make up your own mind!",The Assistant

Thankfully, it was only my time, but I wish I could get it back... a total waste, forgettable, and I feel suckered by the trailer.

296,mdjonas,Missing a Key Element,4,22 September 2021,"While ""The Assistant"" can be applauded for its attempt to address a timely (and painful) subject, key character and behavioral traits are missing from the lead --1. Jane does nothing to connect herself with any coworker - especially the co-office men who are somewhat supportive and certainly not abusive.2. For a position that, as her father observes, is a stepping stone to a potentially exciting career, Jane is singularly unenthusiastic.3. Jane goes to HR to report sexually exploitative behavior without having first talked about this with any coworker. This is particularly telling since the ""boss's"" behavior is well known.4. For a bright, aware person, Jane is completely befuddled by the questions she's asked at the meeting with HR -- she mumbles and fails articulate a single coherent thought.Given her sulky attitude and absence of communication skills, it's hard to see why she was hired in the first place. To create the tension needed to force the audience to address the central issue, Jane needs a much stronger personality.While the film is interestingly edited and constructed, it misses a real opportunity to be effective.",The Assistant

I couldn't believe it ended where it did, it is unfulfilling.

314,scruplesindisguise,Day in the Life of,8,23 May 2020,"Marketed as an urgent and timely thriller where an underdog junior female strives to overthrow the murkiness of an executive film producer under whom she works; a celebration and 'phew, we did it' of a bygone #MeToo era The Assistant is not. Purposely mundane and unexciting, the film focuses on a single day in the life of Jane (Julia Garner), in her 5th week of an unrewarding office assistant job in a major movie firm. The lines are her thankless daily tasks, and visible quite clearly between them is a workplace and a leader prejudiced and corrupt. A score is mostly absent and dialogue is quiet and sparse, especially for a superb Garner, who makes up for her lack of lines tenfold by her evident weariness and muted but devastating facial expressions.We don't get a chance to meet the infamous mogul whom Jane and her colleagues serve, but there's no need for us to. Writer and director Kitty Green omits casting here as acknowledgement of the number of real-life villains that have been exposed in recent years, but also as recognition that there are villains still out there and discrimination and abuse endures.

I strongly advise you to safe your money safe your time and dont watch this movie. Quite literally nothing happens with the exception of filing microwaving and tyding up. It is an appalling movie.

In virtually every scene, her radiant face ripples with suppressed emotion and we live with her torment of being powerless whilst the balance tips in favour of misogyny and sexism. The cool palette, the clarity of the soundtrack, the monotony of office life, all underscore a doleful existence. This is a quiet film that speaks volumes.

There's an eerie undertone throughout somehow making mundane daily activities look sinister. And there's an extensive use of center-framed God's-eye view shots that were stunning.
But the pacing of this movie drags terribly because nothing on screen is engaging content-wise. I almost fell asleep in the middle and when I made it to the end, I was shocked that it was only 85 minutes.
It was completely mismarketed as a thriller, the trailer even contained a quote using the word thriller but it is definitely not. The only thrilling thing I felt during this movie was when the credits rolled so I could leave the theater.

This is not a ""Friday Night Blockbuster"" or a ""Thriller"" as American movies tend to be. This is a FRIGHTENING day in the life saga of what it is actually like to be a woman in the workplace. The microaggressions, the conniving coworkers, the misogyny.... This is a coming of age film for a woman in her first job. Think ""Working Girl"" with a very dull and drab set. That I think was done on purpose, so the office fades away and you can focus on what is actually going on in the toxic male dominated workplace. Don't think this stuff happens? Don't think your wife or your daughter 's experience will be different. Think again. This is an excellent primer on how to teach someone to spot this happening in the workplace, and how to beware of HR about it. I have lived this kind of experience in all but one job I have had in my life. I have had a staff that I was put in charge of, go in to a fit of rage because I was a woman. Unlike this character, I had a good boss... who was male, stand up and fire the instigater on the spot. It was the only time this has been the case that I have ever gotten male support like that. Often the office is in on the code of conduct that is quietly permissible, if not encouraged.

The film follows a single day in the life of an assistant to an executive film producer, but that fact itself is the challenge: THE ASSISTANT is a soul-crushing film that exposes us to the thousand cuts endured daily by assistant Jane (Julia Garner, fantastic in the role).Superficially, very little happens: coworkers occasionally take out their frustration on her when their delivered lunch order is incorrect, as though she prepared the food herself, or else they leave their dirty dishes in the employee kitchen for her to wash while she's standing at the sink, like she doesn't have more important things to do herself. She is occasionally berated by her boss for her missteps in dealing with his angry wife when she calls looking for him. She contemplates filing a complaint with Human Resources. None of this is particularly dramatic on its own. But pay attention: the devil is in the details and what they imply about her boss, her role working for him, and women in this industry.This is a subtle film about abuse so flagrant that it's not only accepted, but joked about. And the questions it raises are not big questions about ethics or industry standards, so much as smaller, more personal questions like, ""What does someone like Jane, who dreams of working in the film industry as a producer, do in the face of this reality?"" and ""How much can one person compromise to get what she wants out of what others call an opportunity?""As to the answers, spoiler alert: that's for you to decide.",The Assistant

It was just a terrible movie.",1,26 August 2020,"After watching the film, I predicted that most of the reviews would fall into two categories: 1) ""I hated it"", and 2) ""Those who hated it didn't understand it."" After browsing them, I see that I was exactly correct.Well, I'm here to say that I completely understood it. The movie was just terrible anyway. I don't need a 90-minute bore-fest get the point, either.I kept thinking ""it's going to really take off any minute now."" But it just never did. It felt like a bad student film. I'd rather watch Battlefield Earth.",The Assistant

Sister gained 5 pounds,1,4 May 2020,"The trailer was so compelling, and with Julie Garner as the lead, I imagined it was going to be a great low-budget thriller. I could not be more wrong. What did I watch?! Due to the pain of what was on the screen, we kept skipping chapters every once in a while hoping for a lifeline. But a lifeline never came. Kitty Green, what were you trying to do? I'm so sorry but there was no depth in this film. I highly recommend you read Julia Cameron's 'The Artist Way,' it will help you really dive deep and get to know yourself and realize what your message is. Because clearly you had no message for this one. My sister was so stressed by the lack of stress that she ate 3 biscuits in a matter of 15 minutes. She worked really hard to loose 5 pounds and just like that, it was worth it to gain them back. So much talent out in the world. So many films that are begging to get made. You finally get greenlit to make one, and this is what you make? I get you were trying to make a Boring film but you could have at least put a little heart and skill into it and it could have been a Great boring film. That's all I have to say.

Most people didnt connect to this boring film because we didnt work as assistants in the entertainment industry therefore most people didnt connect with this film. This shouldve been a direct to TV Lifetime movie.I watched this movie specifically because I like Julia Garner in Ozark but man what a mistake that was.If you want to watch a young intern get scolded over the phone by her boss for no reason at all then this is the movie for you, otherwise dont waste 97 minutes of your life watching this garbage.",The Assistant

Maybe in a different mood and time I might have too.I have had movies where more happened and with better actors that I turned off after thirty minutes. But for some reason I never even thought of turning this one off. Even if not much happened. I felt like the movie represented her life. Like she is hooked to the office. Quite tired. Not much gratitude. She does all that work and sacrifice and then some girl gets the same position but doesn't have to actually work. She just fucks the boss. Wow. I wouldn't have complained to HR. But she did have every right to. And then to be threatened..Anyway. The movie was very very realistic and slow just like life must be when you are so tired all the time and drained.I loved Julia's performance. I was thinking of a 7, 8 or 9 out of 10.But I gave a seven eventually because it still doesn't have that much plot points. And my liking of Julia might interfere with my objectiveness.

351,NYCDrummer,Lazy filmmaking sets a bar low in this reaction formation.,2,18 February 2020,"From the opening shot or two, I could clearly feel that I was in for a ride in lazy filmmaking, where the creators consider the medium the message, not their story craft or obligation to the audience that has put in the effort to actually show up and pay attention.Much of that opening sequence, shot uninspiringly in what feels like available light, creates the aesthetic where the filmmakers feel no need to bother with the traditional specular highlights to afford any type of visual definition. It's as if they literally turned on the camera and got an exposure without any additional effort above what the average person can do with their phone. And while naturalism is a valid motif, this just feels more like a lowering of the bar.This aesthetic continues as the film constantly hits the same notes of the character's mundane existence, over and over again, without providing any new insight. Each of the several sequences of the character operating a photocopier violates the cinema's primal commandment ""thou shall not bore the audience."" When she clears a paper jam, I finally thought perhaps she will discover something on that scrap of paper that moves the story forward.But unlike a Phillip Glass or Robert Reich tone poem which uses monotony to gradually undulate, revealing something in the cacophany, The Assisitant's repetition fails to illuminate the viewer's experience.The male characters that inhibit the film aren't shown as much to be enablers (any more than the female characters) as they are to just simply be blunt characatures. The wonderful but underutilized Mathew Macfadyan as the head of HR tells the heroin ""Don't worry, you're not his type."" This inarticulate hammer over the head moment seems misplaced in what attempts to be a serious, adult and realistic discussion of abuse of power in the workplace.While no one can deny that Julia Garner did a wonderful job embodying the character, the uninspired telling never gives us any insight into why she wants to be a producer, or why her path in life has lead her to endure the mind numbing detail that we the audience are forced to endure as well.I couldn't find anything vital in this entry into the collective reaction formation to the metoo movement. Seemingly neither could several other theatergoers who walked out during the showing I attended.And while there may be still much to mine about the pervasiveness of workplace and power abuse, perhaps one shouldn't abuse their audience in the process, by taking their time, money and attention for granted.",The Assistant

It was heart wrenching. When she was soulessly staring at that mixer, I was staring at it too. I was her, I was living her reality with her.
This is how they got away with it. And to finish it off, in the elevator we get the most blunt recognition of the situation.
I saw a review that said something similar, but it is true: if you found it boring, you were not watching the movie. All this things are loudly subtle. They are screaming in the comments, the actions, the objects, the feelings, the answers. Screaming. If you didn't see it, put your phone down and pay attention to the movie.

359,hot_lesbians,So Boring...,2,2 May 2020,"Maybe it was a mistake to watch this movie after ""The Hunt"" on a movie binge during home isolation. The movie received some spectacular professional reviews but these are nonsense reviews.This movie is good for people who don't work in offices, but want to know what working in an office is like. It pretty much spells out a day in the life of working in an office which has some amount of pressure on the lead female character.The acting may be fine, the cinematography totally fine, though the whole thing was a bit dark (in lighting not emotion). The movie had a choice to make when the scrawny noname male assistant received a turkey sub, instead of chicken, he could have stabbed the Jane girl with a letter opener instead of sulking.What sickens me is the reviews and classification of this movie. In what way is this a thriller? Why is this classified as a thriller by AppleTV? Perhaps if she complained up the chain and/or people who supposed to be on her side, or give the illusion they care, are actually working against her. Then it could be a psychological thriller of gaslights and mental torture as the bad characters twist themselves in pretzels to avoid firing her. None of this. She writes some apology letters.And the reviews, while nothing related to the production of the movie itself, are written in a sycophantic manner.

366,keflex,How to die slowly,7,30 May 2020,"Some people maybe think I mean you'll die slowly while watching this film. There's no plot, per se, and for people used to fast TV drama with lots of killing, it probably does seem boring. I suspect that many negative reviews are from people who also lead quite boring and externally controlled lives (and don't want to watch more of same in film). But that's the point - that you die slowly in a job and inside yourself due to the accrual of small lies, and they can only be seen in microcosm. I think there's a lot of truth in this film if you're willing to slow down and reflect on it. It's beautifully done, (made me squirm inside at the injustices!) but again, there's really no plot and there are no major surprises.",The Assistant
367,udaniel-96363,Could have been better,5,2 June 2020,"The movie portrays predatory men in power abusing young women for sex and how everyone is assisting or turning a blind eye in an office setting to what is going on. While our protagonist is struggling with the moral dilemma that comes with the subject.The movie is powerful because it shows all of that in a realistic setting with realistic people. I especially liked the fact that the abuser was never shown. I think this was an excellent choice.The movie would hit a cord with people who lived through similar events in their lives as they know exactly how our protagonist feels. However, it completely fails pulling in those who have not. This is the reason why this move gets such low ratings.
For most people, it's just a slice of life movie about a boring assistant with nothing happening. There is really nothing the actors could have done to make this better either.I find it hilarious that the movie ends up making a stronger argument why the abuse should go on in the end then against.The only argument this movie was able to muster why all of this is wrong is: ""it feels wrong"", while it gave compelling, logical arguments why this is okay. I'm talking about the HR rep scene of course.
Don't those women have agency to choose whether to sleep or not with the ""abuser""? In every case, the women clearly got something out of the deal. etc...I honestly don't see the point of this movie.

It's slow, it's moody, everything is implied and hinted, and at no point does some convenient purveyor of exposition drop in to explain what is happening. Instead we watch a young assistant, Jane, played hauntingly by Julia Garner, navigate a thankless job in an oppressively misogynistic workplace helmed by an unseen predator who silently devours desperate and naïve young women. The films language is innuendo and all we ever see are shadows and remnants of the unseen boss's indecencies. Still the toxic environment that trickles through Jane's coworkers tells the story of a man who instills not only fear in his employees, but a casual sexism that sees even the brow beaten underlings joking about sexual ""conquests"" and dictating apology letters so Jane can satiate her boss's irrational and easily bruised ego. Even Jane's female coworkers are broken husks, having shed their morality for a chance at success, while expressing their guilt in short tempers, long sighs, and pathetic excuses whispered allowed to themselves. It is ultimately a frustrating film to watch, as its fictional world mirrors one we know to be not only true, but pervasive, and we are left to ponder what path Jane will take. Will she save her soul at the cost of opportunity? Or will she become another shell of a human, giving into piques of anger and turning a blind eye as she serves up fresh bodies to the slaughter.A film that chooses to show rather than tell, it's hard to think of a more pure expression of cinema, or a more haunting portrayal of the abusive environments men like Harvey Weinstein created.",The Assistant

It's a film with no humour, no surprises, no plot, no camera-work, no emotion - i.e. the story in this film is evidently non-existent. There are hundreds of better films produced by not-so-well-known producers at the fraction of this cost.One example of a boring scene I must explain (no spoilers) - there's this time where Jane is seen to use a blender. The scene is over a minute long. No dialogue. There are hundreds of these scenes (opening a computer, using a microwave etc) in the film that does not make any sense.

Overall is a complete waste of time & money. I would have been happier spending $15 in candy crush.",The Assistant

But it is the first time I feel obliged to cause I identified myself to the role of the assistant. Whoever worked in both the corporate world and showbiz (and I did both) can not but think that this is the most underrated film and performance. The leading actress is raw, expressing all this emotional pain and distress which she swallowes inside her deepest cores, trying to keep not her job, but her dream of becoming a producer alive. Her environment is full of humiliation, abuse in every form and all the ingredients of what we consider toxic. Great depicture of the incompetency of HR as well. The writer and director, which I now discover and will dive into her life and work, has definitely a first hand experience of what is going on in the open doors of our offices. Again I can not stress enough, how the Oscar for female lead belongs to Julia Garner. What an outstanding performance!!!!",The Assistant

408,BoaPeep,Compelling Sense of Dread,7,14 June 2020,"I am logging in after lurking for years.This is a good movie, rife with tension, dread, fear, loathing, isolation of one lady who struggles to maintain her ambition and drive under the crushing soullessness of her job.The smallest details become monuments of despair with glimmers of rebellion to maintain a sense of self during her daily ritual of dehumanization.When she reached for the coffee cup, it was a wry moment that anyone can relate to. No one has ever made a movie about a secretary that wasn't focused on the woman's desirability. In this case, her co-workers rallied behind her because they wanted to keep her, because she was good at her job. Down to the tastefully revealing sweater with unattractively hemmed pants, this woman was here to be taken seriously.I thought it was very well shot, kept the tension throughout, even the phonemail with the dad at the end, you wanted to cry with her.

The end of the film leaves an empty feeling though, like it started on one level and just never left it. A bit of subtlety goes a long way. In real world situations like this it wouldn't be obvious at the beginning what was going on, instead the early scenes make it very clear and unfortunately there's not really anywhere for the film to go after that. They could have ended on the same note that they chose and it could have been great but to do that it needed a more subtle start in order to create the necessary build in tension. Alternatively they could have kept the start and changed the ending. It just needed something changed at either end (or even in the middle) to keep it from feeling flat.

The reviews that point out that it's ""boring"" or ""compelling"" are coming at the film all wrong! The plot is based in the facts of the Harvey Weinstein case and is told from the perspective of the assistant to a Weinstein-eske character. It points out the way people look down on and expect assistants to work long hours during tasks other people are ""above doing"" with little or no respect. The fact that the movie takes place in one day is masterful and we are able to see how she is received by coworkers, clients, and even adjacent family members to the boss. Her visit to HR is not only heartbreaking but also in line with reports of the industry. It's a scathing look at the entertainment industry from a perspective we don't normally see it from. Like any movie, there are things I would change, but these were minimal and cosmetic to the film. I feel like her direct coworkers (the two male assistants) would feel for her a bit more than they appeared to, and that the resources at the office (copier, kitchen, etc.) would have been a little better for such a high-profile business, but this may have just been used to enhance the poor work conditions.

Julia Garner is masterful as the repressed assistant, whose face, often in exquisite painterly close-up, barely changes expression. The slow, precise business of cleaning, packing, wiping down a couch (yuck), opening parcels and taking and making calls is in stark contrast to the cultivated indifference of the other employees who are barely identified. The only disappointment was the mumbling attempt our lead character makes to alert HR that her boss has a hotel assignation with what looks like a teenager.
