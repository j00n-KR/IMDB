0,MartinHafer,A terrific performance by Streep...about a woman who is not exactly who she pretends to be.,9,15 July 2017,"Warning: This film is about concentration camps and is VERY hard to watch at times. While I would not put it in the same emotional category as ""Schindler's List"", be prepared and think twice before you see the movie. It is a super-depressing picture.""Sophie's Choice"" is an interesting film in that the performance by Meryl Streep is truly stupendous...one of the best acting performances I've ever seen. To get this part, she learned German and Polish and THEN worked on her accents...and seemed to be great at them as well as speaking German during the flashback scenes. She also has her hair shaved and allowed herself to look just godawful in these scenes. Yet, while she is amazing, the rest of the film is good but not nearly as good. This would explain why this is an unusual case with a Best Actress award for a film that was not nominated for Best Picture. Now I am not saying the rest of the film is bad...but dwelling so much on the present day in the first half of the film seems like a bit of a mistake. The last half, with the powerful flashbacks and secrets divulged about Sophie and her incredibly volatile boyfriend (Kevin Kline) is very exciting and it left you wanting more...and left me wanting far less of the friendship portion in the first half or the ravings of the boyfriend. In fact, I wonder if it might have been better to split this into two entirely different movies. Still, with such a great performance by Streep, it's still on my list of movies to see.By the way, this is not a complaint but in the amusement park sequence near the beginning, notice how Peter MacNicol's straw hat stays on as if super glued to his head!",Sophie's Choice
1,SnoopyStyle,heart wrenching scene and superb acting,8,19 January 2015,"It's 1947. Stingo (Peter MacNicol) moves from the south to Brooklyn trying to be a writer. Sophie Zawistowski (Meryl Streep) and Nathan Landau (Kevin Kline) are his amorous volatile couple and upstairs neighbors. She's Polish Catholic having survived Auschwitz and haunted by a heart-breaking secret. He works at Pfizer and is obsessed with the Nazis. The movie has long flashbacks that reveal Sophie's past and secrets.It's a very slow moving movie at times. It meanders and teases for the first hour. It can get tedious at times. There are some interesting bits like Dickens and Leslie Lapidus. The three actors are superb but they can only hint at the final explosive reveal. The reveals are compelling bits of the puzzle. Streep is impeccable transitioning between the various languages. Kline does a good deteriorating personality. MacNicol gives a solid performance to give the audience a voice. Of course, the climatic scene is heart wrenching iconic cinematic history. The piercing girl's scream is devastating and it shows on Streep's face.",Sophie's Choice
2,mark.waltz,Obviously not a film you can watch over and over.,8,30 July 2020,"I think perhaps every 20 years is sufficient for a film of this disturbing nature. The reason to revisit it is to see the glorius performance of Meryl Streep, going from rising leading lady to superstar with a film that was as shattering in 1982 as it is in 2020. It is a film that when I first saw it had me shaking, and knowing the shocking twists, doesn't necessarily have the same impact even though the subject matter is horrifyingly disturbing.The story is seen Through The Eyes of writer Peter MacNichol, a young Southern man who comes to Brooklyn in the late 1940s and finds himself as neighbors with Streep and her troubled boyfriend, Kevin Kline. When he first sees them, they are having a horrible fight, and MacNichol must comfort her. Later on, Klein apologizes and they begin spending a lot of time together. Rivera friendship, McNichol learns the horrifying truth about both of them, and they are secrets that most people eyes are do not realize about themselves or are too horrified to even confide to their best friends about.One of the issues with the film is its structure, hopping about with flashbacks here and there and having slope points that are often difficult to withstand. But the meat of the drama is where it is at, and deleting characters are truly Disturbed individuals that in spite of their flaws are sympathetic even if troubled beyond cure. Kline, in his film debut, is a revelation, and as the secrets come out about him, it is easy to understand his character's sudden shifts in temperament.But the revelation here is Streep who in a short period of only four years went from featured actress to Leading Lady the previous year and with this a legend-in-the-making. Her character will have you grow as you learn everything about Sophie. Her makeup is here is to, as at times it doesn't even appear that you are looking at the marvelous Meryl. Someone has to suffer when a part among such greatness, and as much as he tries, MacNichol just seems out of place. He does what he needs to do to make the character tick, but his is a non-showy part, just a Greek chorus looking in on tragic people facing their final curtain.One thing that will stick with you if you watch this again after a long gap, and that is how potently subtle the musical score by Marvin Hamlisch is. As the camera moves In for the final shot, you realize how perfect it is for that mood, a somber and chilling moment that you won't forget, just as you won't forget the scene where Sophie must make that choice that no parent should ever have to be forced to make. Bravo to Alan J. Pakula for his brilliant screenplay and fantastic direction that truly makes this a nearly unforgettable film.",Sophie's Choice
3,kosmasp,It's not a game,8,17 April 2019,"I have not read the novel, but it's impossible not to have heard people talk about Sophies Choice. The movie has made a mark in the movie and entertainment business. Although some may feel entertainment is not the right word. And that is even though you have Kevin Kline in this, who a few years later was as hillarious as one can be in Fish called Wanda.Having said all that, let's be clear about one thing: the movie is a drama. And a really good one at that. We're talking about a story that will touch you and that might leave you stunned at that. All that of course works even better if you know as little as possible. One thing that you will know or at least notice is Meryl Streep. If you are more than surprised and might even think this is a totally different person than the Meryl Streep you know, that is all just testament to her powerhouse performance.The movie is also quite frivolous and there is a certain amount of foul language and nudity. So while this can be called sophisticated and has gravitas story wise, this also is not for the easily offended either. Beware of that, if you actually think about watching this.",Sophie's Choice
4,classicsoncall,"""We became the best of friends"".",8,6 August 2011,"As a vehicle for Meryl Streep's incredible range as an actress, ""Sophie's Choice"" is an undeniable recommendation to watch. Unable to shake the ghosts of her past as a Nazi concentration camp survivor, the utter horror of Sophie's 'choice' is a stunning revelation in the flashback part of the picture. Once revealed, it is hard to escape the conclusion that the rest of her post-War life has also become a conflicted series of choices as well - a relationship with a cocaine addicted, paranoid schizophrenic (Kevin Kline), an understated and guarded friendship with Stingo (Peter MacNicol), and the ultimate choice that closes out the picture that argues against whatever other life affirming decisions she may have made after her escape from a brutal past.I think I agree with another reviewer's suggestion that the picture might have been more interesting and effective if most of the story were set during the war in Germany a few years earlier. Then of course, you wouldn't have needed the Kline and MacNicol characters, who to my mind were somewhat miscast here. Maybe that's just me, both give effective performances, but the whole while I kept picturing other players in their roles. But Kline IS good in schizophrenic mode, and the 'Gone With the Wind' segment added some needed color and brightness to the suffocating confines of the boarding house where a lot of the scenes took place.Still, once the nature of Sophie's Choice is revealed, it was difficult for me to maintain attention on the remainder of the story. With the scenes of the concentration camp, I was quickly reminded of 2008's ""The Boy in the Striped Pajamas"", one of the most disturbing films I've ever seen. The entire history of Nazi brutality and attempts at human engineering still make one shudder almost seventy years after they occurred, and should serve as a warning against the threat of existential evil in the world in whatever form it takes.",Sophie's Choice
5,gavin6942,Easily Deserving of the Best Actress Award,7,13 May 2010,"There are many things that can be said about ""Sophie's Choice"". It can be viewed as an immigrant tale or a Holocaust tale or a love story or any other number of angles you want to pursue it. I'm not really going to talk about that. The one thing that stands out for me, and obviously stood out for people at the time, is Meryl Streep's performance.Another reviewer says her performance ""is simply the finest performance ever captured on film. Period."" If that's not enough, they call it ""a gift to humanity."" That might be an exaggeration, but it's true to a point: Streep mastered a few languages and accents, as well as playing her part physically. Sadly, women in American films are more often secondary, but here she is given the starring role and nails it. Many have said this is the single greatest performance from an actress, and they may be right.As for the film as a whole, I'm torn. I liked it, but without Streep, it would have been forgotten decades ago.",Sophie's Choice
6,lee_eisenberg,Don't watch it if you have a weak stomach.,10,27 September 2005,"We usually assume that big stars have to debut in B-movies, but Kevin Kline (my favorite actor) made his debut in ""Sophie's Choice"", an absolutely flawless movie. In 1947, aspiring author Stingo (Peter MacNicol) moves to New York and moves in with concentration camp-surviving Polish immigrant Sophie Zawistowska (Meryl Streep) and her Jewish-American biologist hubby Nathan Landau (Kevin Kline). As the movie progresses, we learn the full story of Sophie's gut-wrenching past, and the truth about Nathan's mental state.I don't know whether this was Meryl Streep's best role ever, but with her impeccable Polish accent, she turns in a top-notch performance, as does the rest of the cast. Alan J. Pakula, who also directed ""All the President's Men"", turned in another masterpiece here.",Sophie's Choice
7,jboothmillard,Sophie's Choice,7,28 December 2008,"I knew that the lead actress won her second Academy Award for her leading role, I knew her two supporting actors, and I knew vaguely the storyline behind it, and it turned out to be a very good film, from director Alan J. Pakula (Klute, All the President's Men, The Devil's Own). Basically young American South writer Stingo (Peter MacNicol) has come to post World War II Brooklyn, and meets beautiful Polish immigrant Sophie Zawistowski (Oscar and Golden Globe winning, and BAFTA nominated Meryl Streep), and her lover Nathan Landau (BAFTA nominated newcomer Kevin Kline). The three of them spend much time together, and become the closest of friends, but Sophie is not as innocent as she seems, she is haunted by ghosts from her past, Nathan is obsessed with the Holocaust, and his violent temper is increasing, it is apparent he suffers from mental illness doesn't help. One night, Sophie tells Stingo the reason behind her tattoo serial number, and the reason for her pain, with flashbacks to 1938, where she and her daughter and son were taken to a Nazi Concentration Camp. Back in present day, Stingo asks Sophie to marry him, she accepts, but at the same time, Nathan is asking the same of Sophie, and Stingo has to be best man, Nathan goes into another violent mood, and Sophie runs to Stingo, and tells the rest of her story. She and her children arrived in Auschwitz, and a Nazi officer forced her to choose life for one of her children, while the other would be taken away and exterminated, she pleads not to have to choose, an officer almost takes both children, but she chooses her daughter to be taken, she believed her son would better survive the camp. After she has finished her story, Sophie tells Stingo not to mention marriage or children, despite sleeping together, and finding a note from Sophie saying she went back to Nathan, Stingo finds that they both committed suicide, he leaves Brooklyn soon after. Also starring Rita Karin as Yetta, Stephen D. Newman as Larry Landau, Greta Turken as Leslie Lapidus, Josh Mostel as Morris Fink, Marcell Rosenblatt as Astrid Weinstein, Moishe Rosenfeld as Moishe Rosenblum, Robin Bartlett as Lillian Grossman, Günther Maria Halmer as Rudolf Hoess, Karlheinz Hackl as SS Doctor and Ulli Fessl as Frau Hoess. The three lead stars all have their great moments together, Kline is splendid being both serious and silly, MacNicol is good as the adorable timid character, but the stand out is obviously a deserved Oscar winning performance by Streep, who handles the Polish accent and language perfectly, and gives real depth to the film that has all the right ingredients, and especially gripping in the Holocaust flashbacks, a splendid drama. It was nominated the Oscars for Best Cinematography, Best Costume Design, Best Music for Marvin Hamlisch and Best Writing, Screenplay Based on Material from Another Medium, and it was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture - Drama. Meryl Streep was number 58 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, and she was number 26 on The World's Greatest Actor, and the film was number 19 on The 100 Greatest Tearjerkers.

8,ma-cortes,A haunting modern tragedy with several grim and extremely dramatic moments,7,16 July 2021,"Sophie Zawistowska (Meryl Streep) is the survivor of Auschwitz concentration camp settled in Brooklyn after WWII . Nowadays , she has found a reason to live with a schizofrenic genius (Kevin Kline in his film debut from Broadway) and Nathan (a very young Peter MacNicol) , and a sparkling if unsteady American Jew obsessed with the Holocaust . For a full three-quarters of the movie's running time , it appears that the choice facing Sophie is between the two love rivals : Peter MacNicol and Kevin Kline , at the boarding house where they live , but the truth is far more terrifying . Between the innocent, the romantic, the sensual, and the unthinkable. There are still some things we have yet to imagine.An artful , impressive and immaculately played drama with an astonishing commanding interpretation by the always versatile Meryl Streep . This chilling portrayal of the banality of Nazi evil was taken from the best-selling auto-biographical novel written by William Styron . Some of the war footage is hard to see and the language is fairly abrasive . The great Meryl Streep learned polish and German language to speak authentically , furthermore her English accent is impeccable . Her grunt-wrenching acting was duly rewarded with Best Actress Academy Award , her second statuette following Kramer vs Kramer , subsequently adding others Oscars and nominations . While co-starring Peter MacNicol and Kevin Kline are pretty good , delivering nice interpretations . Besides, brief appearances from secondaries as Josh Mostel , Robin Bartlett , Eugene Lipinski , Joseph Sommer as narrator and uncredited Tobin Bell as a reporter. In addition , Marvin Hamlisch took an Academy Award for the enjoyable musical score . Special mention for Spanish cameraman Nestor Almendros providing a peculiar and rarely colorful cinematography .This gripping movie-making was professionally directed by Alan J. Pakula . This magnificent American film director, writer and producer was nominated for three Academy Awards : Best Picture for To Kill a Mockingbird (1962), Best Director for All the President's Men (1976) and Best Adapted Screenplay for Sophie's Choice (1982). His production business partner in the 1950s and 1960s was Robert Mulligan . Always highly supportive of his cast , he had a reputation as an 'actor's director'. He achieved several hits as Devil's own , Pelican brief , Presumed innocent , Sophie's choice , Klute and some flops as Starting over , Paralax view , See you in the morning . Rating : 7/10 . Worthwhile watching and better than average . The picture will appeal to Meryl Streep fans .",Sophie's Choice
9,moonspinner55,"Golden-toned without being lyrical, ""Sophie's Choice"" is like an opera without the music...",4,2 December 2008,"Portraying a Polish-Catholic Concentration Camp survivor now living in Brooklyn 1947, Meryl Streep admirably keeps a haunted look in her eyes--and in her forlorn smile--throughout all the fabricated histrionics of this Alan J. Pakula ""prestige"" picture. It's a commendable acting job, most especially because nothing else in this vehicle quite comes off. Sophie, struggling with her broken English during her initial days in New York, is 'rescued' (from despair, from hopelessness) by a combustible genius (Kevin Kline), and soon they are reading literature and poetry to each other in his bed. The details of their love-hate relationship come spilling out to a Southern writer (Peter MacNicol) who has rented a room in the same building as the couple. William Styron's book has become an embalmed actors' showcase, with the three principals each doing contemplative-turned-combative bits of character business, to little avail. There are two or three scenes that put enormous demands on Sophie (and Streep the actress), and the woman simply does not disappoint (my favorite was an early flashback scene wherein she attempts to check out a book by Emily Dickinson but doesn't have the author's name right). Still, Pakula paces the melodramatics with funereal solemnity, and the too-careful, too-rigid art direction and cinematography make the proceedings look like a waxworks museum. Kline cannot get a grip on his tortured Nathan, and for good reason: the character is a writer's contrivance (bombast conjured up out of mental illness), while MacNicol has some strong early scenes but eventually plays third-wheel (not an enviable position). Much discussion was made of Streep's letter-perfect accent and her scenes as a prisoner, and indeed she's quite remarkable; however, Sophie isn't allowed to bloom as a person. Streep makes her tremulous and lovely, nervous and chatty while also politely flustered, and there are moments when she's radiant. Unfortunately, there's nothing gripping or substantial in the writing to help the actress carry the weight of a long, heavy Oscar-contender. We understand right away that Sophie is a survivor with an enormous heart...Pakula doesn't give us anything else to ponder except romantic heartbreak tinged with masochism. ** from ****",Sophie's Choice

Well supported by Kevin Kline, Sophie eventually recounts the impossible situation she found herself in while incarcerated in a concentration camp.

12,sunwarrior13,Meryl Streep Has An Unforgettable Performance As Sophie,10,9 September 2012,"Sophie's Choice is a drama film that tells the story of a Polish immigrant, Sophie, and her tempestuous lover who share a boarding house with a young writer in Brooklyn. The film stars Meryl Streep, Kevin Kline, and Peter MacNicol. Alan J. Pakula directed the movie and wrote the script from a novel by William Styron of the same title.Aspiring southern author Stingo (MacNichol) heads to New York to seek his fortune. Moving into a dingy Brooklyn boarding house, Stingo strikes up a friendship with research chemist Nathan Landau (Kline) and Nathan's girlfriend, Polish refugee Sophie Zawistowska (Streep). There is something unsettling about the relationship; Nathan is subject to violent mood swings, while Sophie seems to be harboring a horrible secret. Stingo soon learns that both Nathan and Sophie are strangers to truth.One evening, Stingo learns from Sophie that she was married but her husband and her father were killed in a German work camp and that she was interned in the Auschwitz concentration camp.Nathan is constantly jealous, and when he is in one of his violent mood swings he convinces himself that Sophie is unfaithful to him and abuses and harasses her. There is a flashback showing Nathan rescuing Sophie from near death from anemia shortly after her immigration to the U.S. Sophie eventually reveals that her father was a Nazi sympathizer. Sophie had a lover, Józef, who lived with his half-sister, Wanda, a leader in the Resistance. Wanda tried to convince Sophie to translate some stolen Gestapo documents, but Sophie declined, fearing she might endanger her children. Two weeks later Józef was murdered by the Gestapo, and Sophie was arrested and sent to Auschwitz with her children.She reveals to him the tragic choice she was forced to make at Auschwitz. Upon arrival, she was forced to choose which one of her two children would be gassed and which would proceed to the labor camp. To avoid having both children killed, she chose her son, Jan, to be sent to the children's camp, and her daughter, Eva, to be sent to her death in Crematorium Two.The movie is too Hollywood in look and feel, and the flashback and narration are too conventional, and yet the image of the sickly and pale Meryl Streep recollecting her ordeal lingers in memory long after the film is over. Streep is memorable as Sophie which makes her truly deserving of the Academy Award for Best Actress that she won for this movie.Though it's far from a flawless movie, it is a unified and deeply affecting movie due in part due Streep's performance and the story just takes over and happens to you. It's quite an experience.",Sophie's Choice

14,preppy-3,Meryl Streep is superb...but the movie isn't,8,31 July 2007,"Meryl Streep plays Sophie Zawistowski--a concentration camp survivor. She's being romanced by seriously unstable Nathan Landau (Kevin Kline). Stingo (Peter MacNicol) is a friend. He watches their romance beginning to dissolve because of Nathan's mental instability and a ""choice"" Sophie had to make.OK--I saw this when it first came out. I was not impressed--I found the story trite and predictable, found Kline overdoing his role so much it became comical, MacNicol so bland you hated him and the movie far too long at 150 minutes. But Streep's performance ALMOST single handedly saved the movie. Words can't describe how good she was. She wasn't acting--she became Sophie. The sequence where she had to make her choice has got to be one of the most disturbing and harrowing things I've ever seen in a motion picture. I can't even imagine what Streep went through to play that. She won a well-deserved Oscar for her role. Unfortunately her acting is the only thing this movie has going for it. Even her performance couldn't save this film from becoming ultimately very boring. It was just too long--by the end I just didn't care about the characters or situations anymore. This gets an 8 solely for Streep's acting. For her performance alone this is a must-see.",Sophie's Choice
15,grantss,"Powerful, engaging, moving drama",9,1 August 2021,"1948. A young man, Stingo, moves to New York with aspirations of becoming a writer. He befriends two of his neighbours, Sophie and Nathan. Sophie is Polish and survived a Nazi concentration camp during WW2. Nathan and Sophie seem very much in love but Nathan's fits of jealousy and abuse threaten their idyllic existence. Moreover, Sophie harbours some deep secrets from her time in Auschwitz.Excellent drama. Initially an engaging story of three friends and their relationship. This largely innocent initial period sets up the film for the later plot developments and revelations. The revelations are incredibly moving, revealing the extent of Nazi brutality and the lengths people had to go to and the decisions they had to make in order to survive it.In addition this some other powerful subjects and themes are explored: the depths of man's inhumanity towards man, abusive relationships and why people stay in them, innocence lost.While the plot and direction set this up to be a great movie, ensuring its classic status is an absolutely mesmerising performance from Meryl Streep as Sophie.

She injects terrible realism into her performance, but when you're able to take yourself out of the story and remind yourself that she's an American actress, not a Polish woman who survived a concentration camp, you're filled with intense admiration. How does she continually give so much flawless emotion, take after take, in a studio with lights shining in her face and a boom mike floating above her head? When you remind yourself that she's an actress going to work every day filming scenes not necessarily in order, you're also reminded why she's considered the greatest actress of the modern era.

19,JamesHitchcock,Meryl Streep's Greatest Performance,8,30 September 2005,"""Sophie's Choice"" is set in Brooklyn in the late 1940s, soon after the end of the Second World War. The three main characters are Stingo, a young writer from the Deep South, and Nathan and Sophie, the couple who befriend him. Nathan is a Jewish New Yorker who tells Stingo that he is a research biologist for a pharmaceutical company. Sophie is a Polish gentile immigrant who has survived imprisonment in Auschwitz by the Nazis. At first the atmosphere is relatively light, one of love, friendship and fun. This part of the film is shot in brilliant colour in a summer setting, and the affluent suburbs of New York seem a safe haven from the horrors of the war that has recently ravaged Europe.Gradually, however, the tone darkens as we become aware that the gentle, beautiful Sophie is hiding a dark secret. We learn that her beloved father was not, as she claimed, an anti-Nazi intellectual, but was actually a rabid anti-Semite and admirer of Nazism whom the Germans murdered by mistake. Nathan originally seems eccentric but vivacious and likable, but as the film progresses he begins to show signs of disturbance, insulting Stingo whom he has previously treated as a friend, and unreasonably suspecting Sophie of being unfaithful to him. We, and Stingo, learn from Nathan's brother that he is in fact suffering from mental illness and that he is only employed by the pharmaceutical company in a lowly clerical position, not as a research scientist, although Sophie remains unaware of these facts.In 1982 there had been many films made about the Second World War, but relatively few about the Holocaust, which seemed to daunt film-makers by its very enormity. Alan Pakula was therefore breaking new ground, particularly as he approached the subject from a controversial angle, tackling the question of war guilt- not the legal and moral guilt of those who perpetrated the Holocaust, but the psychological guilt of those who survived it. After liberation from the camps, many survivors such as Sophie experienced feelings of guilt that they had survived whereas many others, including friends and family members, had died. Sophie's feelings of guilt are exacerbated by her knowledge of her father's odious political views and by the fact that she had attempted to exploit her father's reputation and her fluent knowledge of German in an attempt to ingratiate herself with Rudolf Hoess, the commandant of Auschwitz, whose secretary she became. Sophie's most agonising secret, however, is the ""choice"" of the film's title- the fact that she was forced by a brutal Nazi officer to choose which of her two children should live and which should die. Her love for the Jewish Nathan, whom she clings to despite his mistreatment of her, may be a way of atoning for her guilt feelings.There are a few weaknesses in the film. During the first half the action can be too slow, and Stingo, as played by Peter MacNichol, seems a fairly weak figure. The scene of his sexual encounter with a girl who talks like a whore and acts like a prude would be funny in a comedy but is out of place in a serious film like this one. Despite these weaknesses, however, this is a film which more than justifies its ambitious theme. Meryl Streep is one of the greatest film actresses of all time, and certainly the best of the early eighties, and this is possibly her best-ever role. She demonstrated her famed linguistic talents, playing the Auschwitz scenes in excellent German and the English-language scenes with a Polish accent, but (contrary to what some hostile critics have sometimes claimed) there is more to her acting than a collection of foreign accents. One criticism that is sometimes made of Streep is that she is too intellectual an actress, self-consciously thinking her way into a part rather than trying to live it emotionally, but in this case at least this seems to be the right approach. It is difficult to see how the ""Method"" could cope with a role like Sophie, whose emotional experiences are so far beyond those of any actress likely to be called upon to play her. Certainly, I found this one of the most affecting performances I have seen. Never can the ""Best Actress"" Oscar have been better deserved. Kevin Kline was unlucky not to have been nominated for his part as the tormented and tragic Nathan. This is a dark, sombre film but one of high quality and great emotional power. 8/10",Sophie's Choice

He is astonishing as the tempestuous lover and makes you feel the pain beneath him in each & every sequence.On the whole, A Depressing Masterstroke! Streep is Indeed Immortal!",Sophie's Choice
21,=G=,Streep time,7,29 September 2003,"""Sophie's Choice"" is a luke warm flick with a whole lot of ""toos"". Too long, too obvious, too theatrical, too unbelievable, etc.  Telling of a holocaust survivor in America, Sophie (Streep), and the pair of love interests she cultivates (Kline & MacNicol), this ensemble drama showcases an Oscar winning and memorable performance by Streep who gets to stretch and strut her consummate talents over a 2.5 hour run. Streep's wonderful workout is about the only reason to give this 20+ year old flick a dust off. Recommended only for Streep fans. (B)",Sophie's Choice
22,lasttimeisaw,For Meryl Only!,8,10 March 2016,"Hailed as the best female performance of all-time, Meryl Streep's harrowing incarnation of a Polish holocaust survivor Sophie Zawistowski is truly deserving all the laurels. Written and directed by Alan J. Pakula, the Oscar-nominated director of ALL THE PRESIDENT'S MEN (1976), SOPHIE'S CHOICE starts off as a sparkling JULES AND JIM (1962) frolic, but soon Sophie's past experience has been squeezed out of her buried memory, thanks to the amorous but volatile relationship with a passionate Jew Nathan Landu (Kline in his film debut).However, the film is told from a third person's angle, Stingo (MacNicol), whose voice-over is throughout the entire film, is a young writer comes to Brooklyn pursuing a career in 1947, and Sophie and Nathan are living upstairs in their boarding house. His very first encounter with them is being a self-conscious witness of a vehement squabble between them, on the staircase, Nathan blusters with medical terms to a whimpering Sophie, condemns their doomed relationship, and insolently taunts Stingo for his southern upbringing. But the next day, Nathan comes to make up with him and it turns out he is a great guy when he is not angry, the three of them chum around and Stingo begin to know more about them.Stingo has an incurable crush on Sophie, who is a decade older than him, and vastly admires Nathan's enthusiastic passion for love, literature and music, he doesn't mind to be the third wheel around them, the three form a perfect rapport, except for one thing, Nathan's fitful outburst of rage, jealousy and spite, which the film throws repeatedly to takes the stage, to the convenience of allowing a thoughtful and tender Stingo to comfort Sophie subsequently, then Sophie will confide to him her heart-wrenching life story before arriving in USA. And each time, we get closer to the truth, but like Sophie says to Stingo, even if you know the truth, it doesn't mean you can understand it better.Sophie is not a Jew, she was sent to the concentration camp simply because she tried to smuggle some ham for her ill mother, and more shockingly her father is indeed an avid anti-Semite, who is killed by Nazi because of his nationality, they don't care about his ideology, that is the paradox of Sophie's story, but trenchantly lays bare the barbarian kernel of war: no matter how noble (or in the case of WWII, cockamamie) its cause is, war will most probably turn into a genocide under the volition of those few who seize the power, individualism doesn't stand a chance to secure safety and the civilised is usually the first to die.The character, who speaks Polish, Germany, French and English with a Polish accent in the film, is no doubt Streep's most demanding role and she pours so much empathy and commiseration into her flawless rendition, never over-the-top and never a dull moment with her presence. Sophie is a victim, period, she shouldn't be persecuted for being the survivor while millions are murdered (she was doing all she could to stay alive in the camp); or accountable for her father's radical thoughts, (in her own defence) she has never sided with her father; as for the choice she made between her son and daughter, it is utterly unethical, the cruelest thing ever could happen to a mother. Sophie is innocent, that's why the finale comes off quite uncomfortable, there is no need for her to be martyrised? She has no will to live, probably, but she is not a sinner, very possibly time will heal it, yet why oh why she cannot leave that deadly poisonous man? She had a better choice and forfeited, she doesn't want to promise something she cannot promise, right, but a self-destructive submission is not the best thing her story can offer.Nathan, in Stingo's words, is utterly fatally glamorous, and fittingly, the film reveals the secret of his side, not so plausible (one cannot figure what is the deal behind the day when he claims his biological research has made a Nobel-worthy progress) but Kevin Kline is marvellously bipolar switching from a forcible menace to an amiable life-force, to and fro.Another bone to pick with this otherwise superb war-panning essay, is its clichéd exigency to fulfill a male's ultimate fantasy: ""you're a great lover, Stingo!"", after Sophie finally sleeps with him, this is what a man really wants to hear, even though she leaves without saying goodbye, and at least five times with lines like ""you are so beautiful"" are referred to Sophie from different characters, as a constantly vexing reminder of the shallow canon from a man's perspective, beauty is a woman's original sin, even in Auschwitz, next time, we might wage a war to exterminate all the unsightly ones, that definitely would make the world a more eye-catching place!",Sophie's Choice
23,ElMaruecan82,All the intelligibility of the world can't get over the shock deeply rooted in the experience...,7,6 May 2012,"History seems to me like a book where every single chapter is written under the traumatic effect of the previous one. To better understand Nazism's rise, one must understand the trauma of the 1918 Armistice on German people BUT to comprehend the French diktat of Versailles in 1919, one must also take into consideration the trauma of the French defeat against the Prussian Army in 1870. Following the same logic, History is the never-ending chronicles of successive traumas turning yesterday's losers into today's winners.But blood sometimes dries quicker than History books' ink, and while we're allowed to judge an event in a more rational and reasonable way, it leads to a very singular paradox: if you deprive your analysis from its emotional substance, you get more objective, rational, yet it can undermine your very comprehension of further events, because men make the events, and most of the times, they're guided by the weight of a traumatic experience -every act of terror takes its roots in another one- but then, if you use emotion, you lose the objectivity, which is the key element in science. To put it in simpler words: one death is a tragedy, one million is statistics, statistics are more relevant to understand the present but only tragedy can help to anticipate the future. A film like ""Sophie's Choice"" focuses on one tragedy to better highlight the gravity of a much more large-scaled tragic chapter of Human history: the Holocaust and its profound effect on people's minds. The world indeed would never be the same after 1945.But I'm still perplexed about the film. It tells the story of a young woman who survived the atrocities of the Concentration Camps and had to make one of the most horrific choices that was ever allowed to a mother: choosing which of her children would survive. The irony is that she's given this very privilege because she's not Jewish, she's a Catholic and what's more, not a communist, yet she would have to live with a terrible weight in her conscience, something that a Jewish mother wouldn't have to endure because she would be forced to lose her children. Another irony occurs when we discover Sophie's romance with Nathan, an American Jew, we're shocked seeing treated her as a whore for Germans, no matter how sick or demented he was. As I said, it's only through shock that you can comprehend the atrocity of an event. That Nathan carried this pain in his heritage because he was a Jew is one thing but it would be insulting to those who really lived the experience, to distribute the share of guilt and sorrow in the hearts of people who didn't live it, regardless of their ethnic background.So, I'm trying to figure out what the clear purpose of Sophie's story is? I try to imagine what was Alan J. Pakula's thinking when he decided to make the film. He probably thought that it would be great to have a film depicting one of the most horrific and painful dilemmas ever, carried by a marvelous performance from Meryl Streep, who was in her path for cinematic glory. Then, she'd have to tell her story in flashback, because the choice would only work if it came late in a film, to let us sense a trauma hidden inside her heart. But something must provoke the confession; it must be about children, then Stingo, the young idealistic writer, played by Peter MacNicol must ask Sophie for marrying her. Step by step, we get to the necessity of featuring this sort of triangular love between three friends, Nathan, Sophie's lover, Sophie, a Polish Auschwitz survivor with a lovable accent, and the sweet and naive Southern boy who'll naturally fall in love with them, mirroring their very passion for American literature. The promise of the film is carried by three spectacular performances and a sweet and tender score, but I failed to connect the story to the flashbacks and I wonder what the results would have been if the story was simply about Sophie's experience.The movie is guided by Nathan's weird behavior, Sophie's attempts to speak the most correct English, and Stingo's passive observations, the whole thing enrobed by a sort of back-story involving a passion for English and literature. The feelings driven by these parts go from amusing to infuriating, we're touched by Stingo's sweetness, frustrated by Nathan's lunacy and impressed or not by Meryl Streep's remarkable performance. There's a sort of lightness floating in the air that efficiently contrasts with the darkness of the flashback, but when the flashback started, I felt the weakness of the first hour and half that immediately felt like an overlong set-up and made me wonder what was so special to make this film in the American Film Institute's Top 100? One spectacular moment can redeem a whole film  or is it just because it's a Holocaust story  or a coming of age story of a kid who discovered the world's sudden cruelty from Sophie's trauma? Hadn't he heard about writers like Sartre or Camus who expressed their angst toward a world that allowed the Holocaust to happen and accept the idea of a Nuclear bomb wiping out Japanese civilians?To the choice, yes, it remains one of the most heart-breaking moments in cinema's history as I was haunted by the genuinely frightened look of Sophie's daughter and her piercing cries while she was taken in the misty dark under the powerless look of Sophie. Yes, Meryl Streep deserved the Award for that very part. But the rest belonged to another film, and instead of making another 'Holocaust' story, which I'm sure, would have been extraordinary, I trust Pakula's talent for that. He chose the option of a character study but he thinks too much of us on that level, because all the intelligibility of the world can't get over the shock deeply rooted in the experience.",Sophie's Choice
24,paul2001sw-1,Choose dullness,5,15 May 2005,"Alan Pakula, best known as a director of taut, well-paced conspiracy thrillers, turned his hand to serious drama with 'Sophie's Choice' - very serious drama, in fact, for the subject is the holocaust, following the story of guilt-ridden Auschwitz survivor Sophie (Meryl Streep) attempting to rebuild her life in post-war New York. Unfortunately, the start of the film is very slow, and the trio of central characters manage to appear both as clichés and as a freak show. Schizophrenic Nathan (Kevin Kline), Sophie's new lover, is of some interest but can hardly be said to manifest the classic symptoms of his disease, while Streep, although a capable actress, appears over-stretched in her role, and gives an irritatingly affected performance. Most annoying of all is our narrator, pious, wide-eyed, thick-drawled southern boy Stingo (Peter MacNicol), an aspiring novelist given (in a sonorous voice over) to astonishingly tedious pronouncements such as ""My lust was inexhaustible. Hers was a headlong rush into carnal oblivion"" - at times, it makes for a very dreary movie. The scenes set in Nazi-occupied Poland are in fact much stronger; Streep is much better as Sophie's younger self, and the bleak story throws the horrifying reality of the times into stark, answer-less relief. Perhaps, if the story was told entirely from Sophie's perspective, the film as a whole might have worked better, without the essentially irrelevant medium of Stingo to convey it. As it is, the terrible choice that Sophie has to make is relegated to mere background detail in a film that, for all its evident earnestness, fails to match Pakula's genre-tonged masterpieces, 'All the President's Men' and 'The Parallax View'.",Sophie's Choice
25,ThomasDrufke,Doesn't Hold Up,5,27 February 2020,"For years I've avoided watching Sophie's Choice because I had heard about how difficult it is to sit through this story. In reality, Sophie's Choice is difficult to watch for another reason, it's not a good film. Perhaps it was more a film of its time but nearly 40 years later, it comes off as clunky, boring, and at times really awkward to watch. The only scene worth watching is in fact the choice scene and I think you can feel the weight of that sequence without seeing the other 130 minutes. That's in large part because of Streep's work here, which is extraordinary. But that's about it.5.0/10",Sophie's Choice
26,cricketbat,This should have been about two hours shorter,4,9 March 2021,"Sophie's Choice is two hours of pretentious drama and a half-hour of story that's worth watching. Meryl Streep loses herself in the role of Sophie Zawistowski-at times I forgot that she wasn't actually a Polish immigrant-and the titular moment is well-acted and absolutely horrifying. However, aside from the harrowing flashbacks to Sophie's past, this film is a waste of time.",Sophie's Choice
27,inkblot11,"Devastating, heartbreaking story, with tremendous performances all around",10,24 April 2007,"Sophie (Meryl Streep) lives in Brooklyn, New York with her fiancé, Nathan (Kevin Kline). It is there that a newly transplanted writer, Stingo, meets the two of them. Knowing few others, Stingo is transfixed by the couple, as Sophie is beautiful and loving and Nathan a witty and brilliant man. They befriend the young writer and take him all over town and welcome him for dinner on many an occasion. All too soon, however, Stingo learns that the twosome has dark secrets. Sophie, although a former Catholic, was in a concentration camp in Poland during World War II and is still suffering from the situation. Nathan has disturbing episodes of violence, most often directed at Sophie, and seems to change his demeanor on a dime. Although Stingo tries to help, he fails. Is there something even more disturbing at the heart of the situation? This is a powerhouse movie, devastating and heartbreaking to the extreme. Streep gives a towering performance, well deserving of her Academy Award. Her Polish-American accent is flawless but, even more so, her agony as a concentration camp survivor, is palpable at all times, even when she is smiling. Kline is just as impressive in a virtually thankless role, for Nathan is a tortured soul who takes out his demons on others. The rest of the cast is also great, with Peter MacNichol giving a loving performance as the caring neighbor and friend of the unlucky couple. The sets, costumes, direction, script, and production are in the stratosphere. If you have never seen this film, do seek it out. Although you must be prepared to have your heart broken in a million pieces, at any view, it still is a vastly rewarding look at the human condition, its response to evil, and the ways we can try to overcome it.",Sophie's Choice
28,851222,Excellent,10,6 August 2020,"Greetings from Lithuania.The reason i went to watch ""Sophie's Choice"" (1982) in a first place was the fact that i heard many years people saying that i has the best performance by Meryl Streep she has ever done. Who did not want to see that? And besides that, i did not knew anything about this movie. So after seeing it for a first time in 2020 i can say that its an excellent movie all around. Story was very interesting. Directing was solid, because this movie never dragged for the entire 2 h 30 min. Script was involving. Performance by Kevin Kline was very good. And then there was a performance by Meryl Streep. So basically there is acting in movies and then there is this - you have to see it to believe it - its flawless.Overall, ""Sophie's Choice"" is a beautiful and heartbreaking movie at once. Superbly made and featuring arguably the best performance by an actress ever made, its a must see for all who likes cinema.",Sophie's Choice
29,kenjha,A Choice Role for Streep,7,11 April 2008,"Comments from 2008 Viewing: Pakula skillfully brings the Styron novel about a woman's harrowing journey through WW2 to the screen. Streep's performance comes across as too mannered initially but must be considered a success ultimately, worthy of the Oscar she received. Although his character is supposed to be moody and manic, Kline is still much too animated and somewhat annoying as Streep's lover. MacNicol is fine, bringing much needed normalcy into the story as the young man befriended by the couple. The scene depicting the title of the movie is perhaps the most heart-wrenching in all of cinema. Hamlisch's elegiac score helps create a haunting atmosphere.Comments from 2013 Viewing: The scenes in Brooklyn, which take up much of the film, are repetitious and somewhat dreary. The flashback scenes are disjointed and lacking in narrative flow. Pakula's direction seems heavy-handed and too respectful of the book. Rating reduced from 8 to 7.",Sophie's Choice

32,jzappa,Unqualified Cinematic Power,10,22 February 2009,"My experience with this film was endured without knowing anything about the story ahead of time. It was a jarringly emotional experience, so to preserve that possibility for those who I hope will see it, I will tread gingerly. What I will say is that its structure is the bedrock of its effect. It begins with a pleasant atmosphere, entirely unsuspecting. Then come ominous scenes that the characters seem to pretend to forget afterwards. Then a plunge into an entirely different world indefinitely. Then the initial mood returns without having lost a shred of credibility. Then we return to deep subjectivity of the alternate one, and when we come back, no matter how unchanged the initial setting remains, we are never the same.Note the title. Sophie's Choice. Then note that it essentially features merely three people, Meryl Streep, Kevin Kline and Peter MacNichol. One's first inclination as to what the title character's choice shall be proves to be a disquieting revelation of what little we've experienced in our lives. What do we know? Whatever the most harrowing or ecstatic of the moments through which we've lived barely scratch the surface of life's possibilities owing to the infinite extent of human nature. The relationship between two of the characters is a testament to what a person can and can't live with, and what a person can't live without. Peter MacNichol's mediating protagonist learns this, and so do we, through him.When we are his age, we never believe people, no matter how much we respect them or love them, when they tell us that there is so much we don't understand. As the film begins, we are introduced to the two people he happens to meet when he moves to Brooklyn. In spite of our, and his, initial reaction to them, we grow to believe we know and understand them. We have no reason to believe that when they behave, speak and react, they are inventing or denying anything. Upon reflection, the last line we hear Sophie say to the impressionable young central character has no way of indicating her true reason for saying it, whether it's true or false.All three leads are becoming, deeply realized and even unique in their performances, but Streep deserved all of her acclaim. She truly delivers one of the best portrayals I have ever seen in any dramatic medium. Where she, as I said, neither invents or denies, intimates an authentic facet of human nature's intricacies, more normal and sexy in the early scenes before showing us who Sophie really is. It is a mystery for many how someone speaks in a foreign accent, in this case pivotal to her role, and even speaks the corresponding language, without pretending or affecting, or doing an impression. There is no sign of any seams through which we can glimpse the devil who wears prada or the adventure mom in The River Wild. Without leaning into any extremes, there is hardly an emotion left untackled by Streep in this film.Sophie's Choice appears as if it might as well be shot with a soft lens, a film whose scaffolding is its Oscar-winning star. I cannot tell you how contrary that appearance is, and how eerily relevant that deception is as analogy to the movie itself. There is a rawness that remains untouched by many filmmakers superior to he who directed this, Alan J. Pakula, who also adapted it from William Styron's novel. Pakula is sneaky. The structure of the film could easily have felt uneven. His visual choices could easily have felt alternately overdone and under. We realize later that a handful of early certain scenes which feel initially like sappy Americana are emotional red herrings. He simply knew, in spite of tried and true conventions, logic or practice, that his vision would work. And it is unqualified cinematic power.",Sophie's Choice
33,jtindahouse,Streep is amazing in a haunting tale,8,11 March 2021,"I've heard Meryl Streep's performance in 'Sophie's Choice' referred to as the greatest performance by an actress of all time. Having now seen it I would say that it's at least a fair shout. When you learn multiple languages in order to play a role there can be no questioning your commitment. I read that she literally begged on her hands and knees for the role, and it's understandable why. The role is an actor's dream.The movie itself is an odd one. It's quite different to what I expected. I expected far more of the story to focus on the flashbacks to Nazi Germany, however the large majority of the story is told in the post-war present the film is set in. It's a combination of a love story and a story of grief. There is one scene in this movie that will haunt me for a long time to come. This is the kind of thing that no horror movie could ever replicate. No monsters or ghouls can be ever be as terrifying and cruel as mankind and the things that have actually been done throughout history.This is a long film at two and a half hours. It doesn't lag but it also doesn't exactly fly-by either. This is one of those films that I'm glad I've seen - but I never want to see again.

34,strong-122-478885,"""Suffer Little Children To Come Unto Me.""",5,25 April 2015,"In my opinion - Out of this 1982 film's decidedly over-long 2-hour & 30-minute running time, only 30 of those minutes made Sophie's Choice worth watching.These 30 minutes were the moments (told in very vivid flashbacks) when the guilt-ridden Sophie eventually recalls her experiences as a young, Polish woman, and mother, in war-torn Germany and what ""choices"" she was inevitably forced to make.It took this film 85 minutes of pure drudgery before Sophie finally got around to telling her harrowing story about ""choice"".To say that this movie was marred beyond belief by Kevin Kline's absolutely annoying, over-the-top portrayal of the Nathan Landau character would truly be an understatement. Kline was an ultimate ass in this picture. Needless to say, I hated him, like you wouldn't believe.As well - Drab, dull actor Peter MacNicol was utterly forgettable as the Stingo character who befriends Sophie and learns of her deep, dark secret.And, finally - I thought Meryl Streep speaking broken-English with a Polish accent was pretty disappointing. Half the time I couldn't understand what the hell she was saying.All-in-all - I do not recommend this movie at all. It is far too over-rated, if you ask me.",Sophie's Choice

37,rbverhoef,"Powerful film, great performances",8,6 December 2004,"'Sophie's Choice' stars Meryl Streep as Sophie in a performance that becomes great after half an hour or so. Well, may be it was just me, but she speaks with a Polish accent and I had to get used to that first. WW II is just over, Sophie now is in the US with a man named Nathan (Kevin Kline) who is crazy about her, but gets a little mad when he is drunk or something in that category. They befriend Stingo (Peter MacNicol), a young writer from the South and the film's narrator. Like Sophie, he sometimes has a hard time with Nathan too, but between those moments they are best friends.The story takes a while to get started but that gives us time to take the accent for granted (it is never annoying, but Streep has become a too well-known actress I guess), to understand Nathan, and to see that Sophie carries a lot of secrets. In a long monologue she confesses most of them to Stingo, who falls in love with her. But not only with her, also with Nathan and his spirit that seems so alive at times, and with the relationship Sophie and Nathan have. It is strange to love both of them separately and them together, but the way this is presented is terrific.Tell you more about the story would spoil things. I can say that Sophie's flashbacks go to Auschwitz and that most of her choices have to do with the war and that camp. Although we have seen a lot of WW II dramas by now there are some great and powerful scenes here. I especially appreciated a scene where we see the concentration camp in grey colors, almost black and white, and how the world outside is shown with so much color when Sophie enters it. You will recognize the scene immediately.In these flashbacks we see Streep speak the authentic languages, her German, which I understand, sounded pretty good to me. Most WW II films choose for English and that takes a little power away. Although it is not a very nice thing to say: German sounds less friendly than English, even when it has a German accent. 'Schindler's List', one of the greatest films out there, and 'The Grey Zone' to name a few probably would have been more powerful if the film was in authentic language. (Although especially 'Schindler's List' is powerful enough as it is, I guess.)Streep gives the strongest performance, but we are used to that. MacNicol is solid and Kline's performance makes sure we see how his strange character works. In a way he is as good as Streep. All this, together with some wonderful cinematography, makes this a terrific film, recommended for every film lover.",Sophie's Choice

The Best Female Performance in Film History.,10,13 October 2014,"When you look at 1982 in film, you will see things like Star Trek II, Fast Times At Ridgemeont High, ET, Blade Runner, Tootsie and Gandhi. Sophie's Choice is the most underrated as well as the best. Gandhi may have won nearly every major award and ET may be the most beloved, but this tops both films. ET's only massive strong point is the ending which the movie builds up to, Sophie's Choice also builds but has vast strength from everything that comes out. Gandhi is pretty much the inferior version of Lawrence of Arabia, massively dragged out. There is not one dull moment in Sophie's Choice. It is worth seeing why this is not a dull 150 minute movie.Peter MacNicol plays a young writer, known as Stingo, who moves into a duplex in New York and hits it off with his neighbours, Sophie and Nathan (Streep, Kline) right away. As Stingo grows closer to Sophie and Nathan, winning their trust, he can tell that they are harbouring deep secrets that will change him forever. Peter MacNicol and Kevin Kline are extremely underrated actors. Both of them are extraordinary. Then there's Meryl Streep who gives the best acting performance in film history by a female. A few years ago when I saw American History X, Edward Norton's performance in it became the best I had ever seen. I said nobody, male or female, could top this. Then I saw Sophie's Choice. Does Meryl Streep do a better job of acting than Edward Norton? I don't know, tough to say. But I do know that Norton is the best male performance and Streep is the best female performance. She is the main character who's background gets dived into the most. We see her experience in war and her choice. They are haunting and you will never forget what they do to you.4/4",Sophie's Choice
41,nycritic,Unveiling the Pain Within a Glacial Stare,9,2 June 2007,"Like Madeleine Elster in VERTIGO, Sophie Zawitowska (Meryl Streep) situates herself one rung higher and practically at the top of the ladder of what is the most mysterious of females ever to grace the silver screen and offer the most allure, while hiding an unbearable secret just underneath the surface of skin. And like Madeleine, Sophie evolves into the unattainable object of desire for one shy, inexperienced man who has as of yet been unsuccessful in having a significant attachment to a woman.Stingo (Peter MacDonald, the weak link here but not his fault, it's the role) is that guy, the narrator of SOPHIE'S CHOICE who serves as the observer and ultimate participant in the slow unfolding of her impossibly tragic petals, who at the start of the movie stumbles across her first by the rattling of the chandelier of his apartment's ceiling, later as a heated argument, and finally, in the flesh as a shy woman who happens to be sharing the upstairs apartment with Nathan Landau (Kevin Kline in a strong debut), a guy who turns his temper on and off at whim and who must be impossible to live with, especially when Stingo finds out the reason behind Nathan's wild peaks and valleys.As an apology to the insults Nathan proffers Stingo on their initial meet Sophie and Nathan bring Stingo into their own world and a friendship is born. William Styron and Alan J. Pakula both take their time in establishing the threesome's bond: scenes of dialog hint at the troubles that both Sophie and Nathan seem to be hiding, and of course, Nathan's ever-present and increasingly irascible mood swings which threaten to cause more harm than good. However, Stingo is an innocent caught in the middle and cannot imagine what it is he's walked into. It's only when Sophie steps out from being a mere acquaintance and discloses some pertinent information about herself -- even when it's an untruth, the real story comes out much later -- is when the movie shifts consciousness and turns its focus on her.And this becomes the way of bringing forth not just a character, but an actress' inner horror, which here becomes a thing of indescribable beauty, translucent, and in one crucial scene, unbearable. Sophie has a story to tell, and once it comes forth, the camera never pans away from her face (except to reveal the actual flashback sequences, shot in sepia tones) and lights it in a cold blue tone which accentuate Meryl Streep's blue eyes and turn her into a Vermeer, or a living Mona Lisa. Sophie's story becomes so powerful that it actually trumps the oblique meandering of both Pakula and Styron: a mere 90 minutes would have sufficed and it wouldn't have lost its impact.",Sophie's Choice
42,LeonardKniffel,Meryl Streep at Her Finest,10,30 April 2020,"This is an early example of Meryl Streep displaying her extraordinary ability to imitate foreign accents, playing a Polish victim of Nazi evil in this moving 1982 adaptation of the novel by William Styron. Most horrifying moment: from the Nazi guard who tells Sophie that she must choose which of her children she will be allowed to keep, ""You are a Polack, not a Yid. That gives you a privilege, a choice.""",Sophie's Choice
43,TheUnknown837-1,"the emotional climax of ""Sophie's Choice"" will haunt you for the rest of your days",10,2 May 2010,"""Sophie's Choice"" is a hauntingly dramatic and beautiful film with the always enthralling Meryl Streep portraying a Polish woman who survived the Holocaust only to find her life wrecked by another tragedy. Any film that revolves around the Holocaust, in which more than six million Jewish people were exterminated within half a decade, should, but intrinsic nature, be gut-wrenching and poignant and sad. ""Sophie's Choice"" is all of that and more.Sophie, played by Meryl Streep, is the main character upon whom the story is focused, but the central character, from whose perspective the movie is told is, is Stingo, a young American writer played wonderfully by Peter MacNichol. Stingo, hoping to finish his novel, rents an apartment in Brooklyn. His neighbors, who live upstairs, are Sophie, a beautiful Polish survivor of the Holocaust and her boyfriend Nathan, a warm, friendly Jewish man. Stingo discovers through odd circumstances that there is concrete truth behind Nathan's odd behavior: being up down one minute and vehemently down another. As he watches Sophie and Nathan's relationship fall apart and come back together again, Stingo comforts Sophie and learns her whole story, from the point where she turned against her anti-Semitic father, was imprisoned with the people her father persecuted, lost her children in the extermination camps, and ultimately her reveal of the titular choice that she had to make, the one she can still not forgive herself for.This is a very tragic and haunting story based on a controversial novel by William Styron. I can't say about the book, but the film adaptation is so emotionally strong and so gut-wrenching in its more depressing moments that it ranks up there with films like ""Schindler's List"" and ""The Pianist"" in the way it manipulates your emotions and forces you into giving sympathy for its character. The screenplay written by director Alan J. Pakula is warm and rich and perfectly encompasses every scene. There isn't a moment that does not work; not one frame that should have been trimmed off. Each and every character, even the small ones, have their purpose and fulfill them with quintessential development so we see these people as human beings. And we have to. The Holocaust was about loss and the struggle for recovery for the people who endured it, even those who did not survive. We have to see them as human beings, not stick figures. The movie does not take for granted that this is set in a true period of time, but uses that as an element for generating a reaction from the audience. A brilliant element is the way the storytellers parallel between the flashbacks and the continuing storyline how the character of Sophie has changed. Before the Holocaust, she is depicted as being confident and strong. Afterward, she is gentle and sad and seemingly immature, having been watered down by her experiences.""Sophie's Choice"" is a very well-made film with brilliant, eye candy cinematography by Nestor Almmendros and an ear-worm soundtrack composed by Marvin Hamlisch, but the subject that everybody always relates to is the acting. I, too, praise the acting. Meryl Streep, one of the finest actresses in the history of the cinema, won an Academy Award for her portrayal of a sad, memory-haunted woman and she does it with absolute perfectionism. Hollywood lore relates to the methods Streep prepared for the role and persuaded director Pakula to give it to her and you can see the payoff for her hard work on the screen as she effortless paints this character portrait. Kevin Kline made his debut in ""Sophie's Choice"" and its a heck of a performance the way he blends his moments of heart-cheering warmth and frightening temperaments. Peter MacNichol is also fantastic as the narrator Stingo.This is one of the most haunting pictures I have ever seen. I was recommended to it by my mother, who saw it in her college years and despite having not seen it in more than twenty years, could still vividly remember the emotional climax: the choice that Sophie must make. Now having seen the movie myself, I can understand why. ""Sophie's Choice"" is not the typical tear-jerker. Nor is it the typical Holocaust drama. It is an astonishingly absorbing and wonderful motion picture that will leave a haunting, persistent impression in your soul.",Sophie's Choice
44,gab-14712,Meryl Streep's Iconic Performance!,8,8 December 2019,"Have you ever heard of someone use the term ""Sophie's Choice"" before? If so, have you thought about what it meant, or where the term comes from? According to Dictionary , ""Sophie's choice refers to an extremely difficult decision a person has to make. It describes a situation where no outcome is preferable over the other."" That term comes from the heartbreaking choice the main character, Sophie had to make in the novel by William Styron and the 1982 Alan J. Pakula film, Sophie's Choice. When this scene appeared in the movie, all my emotional defenses collapsed and I weeped. This scene, where poor Sophie had to give in to the Nazis, tore me apart and is one of the most heartbreaking scenes in any movie that appeared on a giant screen.I really need to talk about this film's acting because this film is such a character-driven film. Meryl Streep absolutely owns this role as Sophie, and it shows why she is the greatest actress of any generation. Even reluctant fans of hers admit this performance is amazing, perhaps the best part of the movie. She completely deserved all the accolades. From her performances in The Deer Hunter and Manhattan, Meryl was on one hell of a run. Streep delivers a gut-wrenching performance that hits you to the core. She is excellent at conveying emotions and she came across as realistic with her Polish accent that was on point. Another good performance came from Kevin Kline, making his film debut. Kline, who plays Sophie's bipolar lover Nathan, really delivers the goods as a crazy romantic. The other big performance is one I was not keen on and unfortunately, it drags down the film somewhat. Peter MacNicol, whom is better known for working in comedies, unfortunately does not stand tall with the other two leads. Maybe it's because the film is mostly told from his point-of-view as an outsider looking in or maybe Stingo is not much of an engaging character, but MacNicol was miscast and that dragged the film down from perfection.Right after the Second World War finished, an aspiring writer from the South named Stingo (MacNicol) moves to Brooklyn to pursue his writing interests. In his new apartment, he meets Sophie (Streep) and her lover, Nathan (Kline). They all became really good friends. Stingo later learns that Sophie is an Auschwitz survivor. Everyone should be aware that Auschwitz was the most infamous of all Nazi Germany's concentration camps. As time progresses, Stingo and Sophie become much closer to each other and Nathan's state of mind worsens.The film was directed by Alan J. Pakula, best known for his directorial work in 1976's All the President's Men, also a character-driven film. Pakula knows how to work with great actors so it should not be a surprise that he directed Streep to her best work in her incredibly long and satisfying career. The cinematography is very beautiful, thanks to the underrated work of Nestor Almendros. I love his contrast in colors. The use of bright colors when in Brooklyn and the haunting use of dark colors in wartime Poland.I really liked Sophie's Choice. Considering how it's in the AFI Top 100 list, I thought I was going to love the film. I loved Streep's beautiful, mesmerizing performance but MacNicol's character/performance dropped the quality of the film a whole letter grade for me. But when Streep is seen on the camera, she absolutely leaves everything to dust with her performance that will surely break your hearts. This made me feel what being a survivor of such senseless tragedy would feel like. It hit me incredibly hard and it is the kind of performance that will stay with you forever. Overall, this is a good film that has some questionable character development but has some incredible thematic work.My Grade: B",Sophie's Choice
45,SmileysWorld,Streep at her best!,9,12 September 2010,"These days I watch movies via DVD,as I have two young children and it's just harder these days to watch a movie straight through than it used to be unless I am in theater.I usually,as a result,end up watching a movie in parts.I intended to do that with this film,but ended up being so captivated by the story,not to mention the ever dazzling acting ability of Meryl Streep that I couldn't turn away.It takes a lot for me to sit through a movie uninterrupted nowadays,and Sophie's Choice delivers the goods.I was deeply moved by this film,and it does it's job well.Streep of course is the star,but she is supported well by Peter MacNicol and,Kevin Kline in his first film role.",Sophie's Choice
46,Ruskington,Meryl Streep's finest hour,8,23 August 2020,"It's not exactly a controversial opinion but I would rate this performance as Meryl Streep's career highlight and possibly one of the greatest ever. Her portrayal of Sophie is absolutely mesmerising and builds towards one of the most haunting scenes you could possibly imagine.The other performances are a mixed bag with Kevin Kline captivating if a little excessive and Peter MacNicol just far too sappy and cloying. The story itself is a bit clunky and lacks flow, relying far too often on the incredible cast to pull it through. And without a doubt, the film is simply way too long.While the lead performance makes Sophie's Choice almost a bucket list movie, the overall film doesn't quite do Streep justice and falls short of being a masterpiece.",Sophie's Choice
47,Dan1863Sickles,Streep Soars Despite The Flawed Storyline,3,15 October 2021,"Meryl Streep is amazing in this movie. She's as soft and luminous as Ingrid Bergman in CASABLANCA. (Another pure heroine tormented by Nazis.) Kevin Kline is very good too. But neither of them can save this manipulative, deeply dishonest wannabe tragedy. The real villain is the author, a dead southern windbag named William Styron.Styron has an agenda, and it's a bad one. There's a revealing moment at the beginning of the movie where young Stingo, just up from Virginia, playfully informs us that his fire-breathing Confederate father considers New York City ""the Sodom of the North.""We are supposed to believe that Stingo worships Sophie, that he idolizes Nathan, and that he's crushed by discovering the tragic truth about the two of them. But Styron is slyly working the angles, subverting the tragedy to further his own ends. Nathan the Jewish genius is discredited completely. He's revealed to be a loony tune, bullying psycho who knows nothing about Sophie's suffering and exists solely to rub salt in her wounds. The suffering (and consequently the moral authority) of the Jewish people is erased, and the gallant Southern boy has to rescue the pure white heroine from the diseased unclean Jew who offers only degradation and death.Now Meryl Streep plays Sophie with sympathy, insight, and courage. She gives Sophie enormous dignity. But if you look at Styron's story, the emphasis isn't really on the courage or resilience of the character, but on how flawed and weak she is. She has only one gift to give Stingo, and it's between her legs. Nathan and the Nazis have defiled her so much that really, she's better off dead.And what is Styron trying to say? That the South is really much better than the Sodom of the North!""And so you see, dear reader, the death of my friend Sophie forced me to realize that the whole universe is one big concentration camp run by God -- the biggest Nazi of them all! So when you think about it, slavery in Virginia wasn't really all that bad. And it was God's fault anyway. Pretty good tragic insight there. Think I'll crank some Bellamy Brothers and get loaded!""",Sophie's Choice
48,skepticskeptical,Not dated in the least,8,7 April 2020,"I am just throwing out a quick review here to say that I respectfully disagree with recent viewers who claim that this film is dated. In fact, could not disagree more. How can a Holocaust film such as this ever be dated? It is set post-World War II, so it´s not as though everyone is donning 1980s fashion or anything like that.I do not know why it took me so long to view this oft-cited film but I am very glad that I finally did. Which is not to say that I found it to be flawless. I believe that parts of the last fifteen minutes were completely implausible and the film would have been much stronger without ¨that one night¨...Not being a speaker of Polish, I cannot comment on the accuracy of Meryl Streep´s accent, but I do think that her performance was completely convincing and well deserving of the Oscar for best actress.",Sophie's Choice
49,sashank_kini-1,"Meryl, acting as a medium for Sophie, gives the most powerful performance I have ever witnessed",9,4 March 2012,"When Meryl Streep's Sophie slowly discloses her holocaust experience to Peter MacNicol's Stingo I literally felt I was witnessing the entire experience first-hand. Have I had such an experience with any other actor? No, I never have. Part of the credit goes to Alan Pakula for representing the event starkly but a majority of the effort is from Streep who can be termed as the 'best storyteller in the world'. I could sense her caliber in Out of Africa when she importunes the Governor to help the Africans and during the courtroom scene in Kramer vs Kramer, but only in Sophie's Choice could I see no Meryl but a completely different person by the name of Sophie Zawistowska. But that was also the case with Daniel Day Lewis in My Left Foot, but Meryl, in my opinion, had such a difficult character to portray that to achieve the effect of transporting the audience into Sophie's world without faltering any moment is the pinnacle of the state 'I am' in acting. Some say she her Polish/German/Broken English accent and diction weren't believable enough; my only advice to them is - try perfecting a foreign accent in 3 months yourself. On top of that, Meryl had to transcend Sophie on to the screen, not just with the accents, but with gestures, movements and more importantly, feelings. And Sophie has probably the saddest fate a woman could have - she was married to fear, grief and loss, first during Holocaust and then after the event. Throughout her life, she has had to make choices, many against her conscience; not only the choice that gives the film it's name, but also others for example, in spite of loathing her father's ideals, she used her pure blood status to escape more misery. But the ghosts of her past slowly unravel when Stingo, a young simpleton author develops friendship with her and her lover, the volatile Nathan. And Meryl does all this with uttermost sincerity and spontaneity, never faking it even when she could have got away with it because many people fall for pretenses. I'll tell you about a play I had seen yesterday where one of the actors, as the situation was reaching it's climax, began screaming his lines out as if stung on the rear by a bee.   The audience, to my dismay, was in raptures, with an old lady besides me commenting ""Superb performance"" and I was like "" O these audiences can be tricked so easily!"". So there may be people who find Meryl's performance to be 'dull' at first, and it is because they believe only an external representation of emotions is enough. I request these people to surrender themselves to Sophie, rather than thinking about how she could have cried buckets instead of just one teardrop to show that she was sad. The character is embodied so completely that I may not be able to endure Sophie's misery again. The choice scene, when watched during the film, is a million times more painful than watching the four minute clip separately on YouTube. The most powerful performance I have witnessed by an actor or actress.Kline and MacNicol have a hard time measuring up to her, but in a way, they gave better performance because of the support they got from Streep's performance. Kline is theatrical but his act suits his character well at times. MacNicol doesn't fail but he neither succeeds in fully justifying his difficult character. The supporting cast, mostly consisting of Germans give authentic performances, the best one coming from the little girl playing Sophie's child, the Nazi officer and the German officer's daughter. The background score is haunting and perfectly placed in the scenes. I frankly wanted more much Sophie and could do without that young coarse lady who had a short-lived romance with Stingo. It was an extraordinary experience watching Meryl acting as a medium for Sophie Zawistowska and a harrowing one to see Sophie's misery.My Rating: 9 out of 10",Sophie's Choice
50,oOoBarracuda,Sophie's Choice,4,8 January 2017,"Typically, if a film takes me more than two viewings to get through, I give up on it. Having never been too enamored with Meryl Streep, at least not to the level that most are, I decided to stick with Sophie's Choice, through the multiple viewings it took for me to eventually be able to finish it. The 1982 film by Alan J. Pakula is the one I've heard continuously referenced on the rare occasion I admit to not being a fan of Meryl Streep. I was looking forward to seeing a facet of Streep's that I hadn't before seen. I do find Meryl Streep to be a fine actor, that must be noted, although I have never been taken with her to the degree of most others. Starring along with Streep, Kevin Kline, and Peter MacNicol, Sophie's Choice weaves together the life of a young writer into the lives of his new upstairs neighbors of which he soon learns harbor deep life-changing secrets.Stingo (Peter MacNicol), an American writer from the south, travels to a place as strange as Brooklyn just after WWII. He is looking for a quiet place to work on his next novel and takes residence at a humble pink apartment building. On one of his first nights in the apartment, Stingo hears a violent fight break out between his upstairs neighbors Sophie (Meryl Streep) and Nathan (Kevin Kline). When the fight comes into the hallway, Stingo interjects himself in hopes to prevent any violent escalation. He is confronted by Nathan who pokes fun at Stingo's accent in a frightening and overbearing way before leaving the apartment. Stingo takes the time to tend to Sophie, worried and taken aback by their conflict he begins to learn a great deal about the dynamic between the two. The next morning, Nathan apologizes to Stingo and is invited into the lives of Sophie and Nathan. The more he learns about the two the more he understands that they have a union that is not the typical happy cohabitation unit he is used to. Stingo eventually learns that Sophie, a Catholic, is a survivor of the concentration camps of WWII. Nathan is an American Jewish man who is absolutely obsessed with the holocaust and views Sophie as some kind of a trophy of his passions. Nathan is incredibly erratic and is completely unpredictable in behavior, often leaving Sophie to her own devices for an undetermined amount of time. Sophie refuses to leave Nathan, however, completely dependent upon him. On one private night, Stingo learns just how emotionally damaged Sophie is when he learns just how gut-wrenching her life through WWII was.Meryl Streep gives a powerful performance in Sophie's Choice. No one who sees this film will ever forget ""that scene"" in which we see her make the titular choice. I am a huge fan of Kevin Kline, and he played his unpredictably unbalanced role incredibly well, and was the standout, for me. The part of Stingo, played by Peter MacNicol, never resonated with me and felt completely miscast. The film had an awful pace, building character development only to have it come together in the last 25 minutes of the film. If I invest over two hours in character development, I really don't want a film that I could have watched the last 25 minutes of and been just as wise to it. There was no payoff to the investment one puts into this film that makes it worth a 2.5 hour watch time. I have no problem with long films, but a well-done long film makes the time you put into it worth it. Sophie's Choice is a film that you can watch one scene from ""that scene"" and be able to successfully fill in the blanks of the rest of the film. This film, in no way, endears me anymore to Meryl Streep; I much prefer her in Kramer vs. Kramer, or even The Bridges of Madison County, although I suppose I won't give up on Streep just yet.",Sophie's Choice
51,roghache,"Wrenching, horrific choice but ruined by post war story",4,2 April 2006,"I realize I will be in the minority but personally, I did not care for this film. Meryl Streep won a Best Actress Oscar for her portrayal of Sophie, a woman forced to make a gut wrenching decision in a concentration camp. Streep is not normally my favorite actress, though I did like her in Music of the Heart. I couldn't really decide here whether this was a superb portrayal of Sophie's devastating choice, or whether my judgment was clouded by all my past negative impressions of Streep tending to overact.The story revolves around a Polish refugee, Sophie, who is haunted by past concentration camp experiences, in her modern relationship with a schizophrenic American Jew, Nathan, who is obsessed with the Holocaust and is abusive to her. The story is related by their mutual friend, Stingo, a Southern writer who has come to post war New York.The flashback scenes to Sophie's Auschwitz days are unforgettable and her choice horrific, but in my opinion, her story would have been infinitely more powerful if the entire movie had been set back in Nazi Poland, where she served as Rudolh Hoess's secretary due to her fluency in German. I completely agree with a few others, who also find it's an effective one third of a movie, the concentration camp portion. Much of the film is boring, as we await the gripping climax.I am a mother and certainly find Sophie's choice a haunting one but this movie not at all impressive. The only character of interest in the post war setting (the majority of the picture) is Sophie herself. It does indeed diminish Sophie's dramatic tale, that her woeful experiences (in fact, a living death) are placed on equal par with all the assorted psychological jumble of Nathan's admittedly sad (but apparently atypical) paranoid schizophrenia and, worse, the mindless tittle tattle of Stingo's love & sex life.",Sophie's Choice

Pakula for turning this potentially gloom and doom movie into a lively, humane, and thoughtful movie about the impact of final solution-related events in World War II on a Polish woman who had been in a concentration camp , and her Jewish American lover - superlatively portrayed by Streep and Kline, respectively.Streep is simply phenomenal. I have read that she learned German and Polish for this film, and she certainly delivers in her accent and acting. But it is her ability to convey emotional nuances that makes her performance so memorable.I must say that I found Kline's performance exceptional in every sense. His deteriorating mental state, his jealousy and his love for Sophie are all superbly conveyed. Truth to tell, I felt that Kingsley's performance as Gandhi did not demand as much as Kline's Nathan, the unraveling would-be biologist -but it was Kingsley who picked up the Oscar.Peter MacNicol is not on the same level, but does not compromise the standard of acting in any way. The other outstanding piece of acting comes from Gunther Maria Halmer as Hoess, the German SS officer who forces Sophie to make the worst and most difficult choice of all.Great cinematography, fantastic script. Must-see film.",Sophie's Choice
54,adrianovasconcelos,"Peerless direction by Pakula, sublime acting by Streep, Kline and Halmer",9,5 January 2021,"When the 1983 Oscar ceremony came up, ""Gandhi"" was the clear favorite and it won accordingly. As I see it, its advantage over ""Sophie's Choice"" was that Gandhi was an universal figure, and one who had fought peacefully for freedom.In ""Sophie's Choice"" we find characters at the opposite end of the mental spectrum: The German concentration camp officers ready to exterminate Jews, Sophie's father who subscribed to those same extermination objectives; Sophie who lies about her father, her children, and deceives her lover; Nathan, who lies about being a biologist and who is described as completely mad by his brother, who is a medical doctor; and Rudolf Hoess, the softly spoken German officer who forces Sophie to make the choice no one should make.Compare that behavior with the civility displayed by most characters in ""Gandhi"" and you can see why the latter would always win more Oscars that night. Yet, I feel that Pakula and Kline had to work with far more demanding material than Director Attenborough and Ben Kingsley, who won the best director and best actor statuettes, respectively.The only negative aspect - from my fallible standpoint, of course - about ""Sophie's Choice"" is the choice of Peter Mac Nicol for narrator. Such a central role shoud have gone to someone with more experience and recognized standing. Not that he is a flop, or that he compromises acting quality or film fluidity, but he is a class below the two leads.Photography is splendid, Streep looks gorgeous besides serving up possibly the best role of her superb career - not just her Polish accent, but the German she had to learn for the part and which she delivers almost flawlessly, the eye flutters, the voice nuances, absolutely astonishing show.Kline is equally good. His range, from funny to demented, from gregarious to aloof, from freedom-loving to jealous, is remarkable, and it may have been the blueprint for his deserved supporting Oscar for ""A Fish Called Wanda."" Ssdly, he disappears from the film for a while at the end, and that may have cost him the Best Actor Oscar for 1983, because otherwise his role is far more demanding and versatile than Ben Kingsley's.Alan Pakula never directed better.

56,ilpohirvonen,"A great story, a good movie.",7,29 January 2010,"Sophie's Choice, directed by Alan J. Pakula, was made famous by an actress called Meryl Streep. The choice she had to make, and that particular scene must be the first thing that comes to the mind of a person who is thinking of this movie. Meryl Streep did a good job as a Polish immigrant Sophie Zawistowski, which is one of her most remembered roles.When I started watching this movie, it didn't take long for me to see how great the storyline was. It's not hard to believe that the book is good too. A Polish immigrant (Meryl Streep), her lover (Kevin Kline) and a young writer Stingo (Peter MacNicol) meet under the same roof, because they live in the same semi-detached house. The triangle, the three characters firstly reminded me of Truffaut's masterpiece Jules et Jim (1962) and you could see other references from Truffaut as well. The storytelling is not typical for America. It has got a lot of influences from European films from the 50's and the 60's. So get ready for something a little different.Basically it's a romantic melodrama, which can also been seen as a description of concentration camps, WWII, maybe even narcissism. It can be watched from many different point of views. The fictional story fits perfectly, because that makes it easier to relate to the events.Stingo (Peter MacNicol), the young writer, gets in the middle of the troubled relationship of Nathan Landau (Kevin Kline) and Sophie Zawistowski (Meryl Streep). They become the three best friends (a bit like in Jules et Jim), then we get to know a little more about Nathan's background and about Sophie's past. It's well written, not a single boring moment, maybe mostly thanks to the writer of the book.As I already mentioned the story is great. But in this case, story wins the film itself. The direction isn't bad, neither is anything in the film, but there are actually nothing special either, besides the great story. So the cinematography, camera-work and the direction seems pretty average to me. The powerful performance by Meryl Streep is the thing that holds this film together, but it's not a bad thing. Perhaps this movie doesn't need any other great elements.I wasn't expecting a masterpiece or a cinematic gem, and I didn't get one. What I did get was a good, touching experience with a great story and a good film.7/10 Great story, great performance by Meryl Streep and nice influences from Europe.

59,macpherr,"This is a good movie to understand a paranoid schizophrenic, and the horror of a concentration camp.",6,29 September 1999,"Sophie Zawistowska is stunningly portrayed by outstanding actress Meryl Streep (One True Thing) who won the Oscar for Best Actress for the part. Nathan, Kevin Kline (French Kiss) is a paranoid schizophrenic. Nathan has this mania of grandiose, mood swings. He bites Sophie.  Their relationship has its ups and downs. When Nathan is up, he is beyond up, when he is down he is suicidal. Stingo,  Peter MacNicol (Ally Mac Beal), is their good friend who falls in love with Sophie. I found the story to be somewhat on the sad side: (1) Because of the situations that Sophie has been through in her life; (2) Nathan's illness and his addiction to cocaine; (3) the concentration camp. But Meryl is so wonderful with her accents, which makes one forget all the sadness in the movie. This is a good movie to understand a paranoid schizophrenic. When the person with the disorder is treated properly their quality of life can be enhanced. But Nathan in not taking medication and is addicted to cocaine. Favorite Scenes:  Sophie, Nathan, Stingo playing the piano six hands. Nathan conducting the orchestra in a bay window, which gives basically three images of himself.  Three glasses of Champagne on the Brooklyn Bridge. Nathan was fatally glamorous but severely ill. Favorite Quotes: ""The truth does not make it easier to understand."" ""The truth... I don't even know what is the truth after all those lies I have told.""",Sophie's Choice
60,patriciogl10,Classic picture? Not really. Timeless performance? Definitely.,7,26 August 2018,"The biggest reason one would have to watch this movie is Streep's performance, and of course its compelling story. I'm not really a fan of Streep's overestimated acting abilities but I believe it all really started for her with Kramer vs. Kramer and this ultimately put her on the spotlight, and with absolute reason. Her performance in this movie remains and will remain a worldly landmark of historical excellence in acting. She captivates you very early in the movie and it just keeps growing and growing until you are in outright awe and emotionally drained, specifically when we reach the final act and come to the realization of what her choice actually is. To me, the highlights of the story are the flashback sequences, which I find most intriguing and I love how they were slowly build up right up to that famous climax where we see Sophie making a heart shattering decision. I believe that Kevin Kline and Peter MacNicol are severely outshone by Streep's performance; I just couldn't care enough about their characters. I disliked Nathan from the beginning, I found him to be such an annoyingly phoney man, and thoroughly despised him, perhaps that speaks well about Kline's performance. Stingo was such a weak and spineless character that didn't even connected with Sophie at a deep personal level in my opinion. Sidenote: was it really love that always made Sophie come back to the malicious and unstable Nathan? Or was it her deep and everlasting gratitude that spoke through her motivations? That was something that got stuck with me after the movie ended.Alan J. Pakula did a fair job from the director's chair, although it is my least favourite film by him (out of the ones I've seen of course).In conclusion, I don't really think this movie holds up to this day as a classic piece of cinema per se, but I do believe that Meryl Streep's outstanding timeless performance is worthy enough for you to make an attempt at watching this motion picture. I can definitely say you won't regret it.",Sophie's Choice
61,fimimix,..only one of the commentaries found its true star...,10,1 May 2006,"...all of the characters in this astounding book/movie were as good or as unimportant as viewers/readers found them to be, simply because William Styron developed them that way: Stingo WAS an unexperienced nerd, having lived an idyllic life in the South with nothing happening in his life, yet aspired to write the Great American Novel; how perfect for a virginous male to so fortunate to live with people who educate him what a horrendous journey life can be. McNichols was perfect for this role, because he was the opposite of Sophie. Nathan was mad and KNEW he was mad, longing with all his soul to be otherwise; a little madness drives people to do astounding things. Kline was perfect; what a shame he has never found another role as good. Sophie was the haunted lady whose life made her that way; Styron's development of her character is masterful. I read an interview in which he was asked how he felt his novel was presented in the film. His reply, ""I took the money and ran."" He could foresee there would be controversy over his work.Some viewers, especially the younger ones, cannot appreciate how actresses have developed over the life-time of movie-making. They should watch some of the ""silent"" films to learn that mime was the only way to express an emotion. Mellodrama, intentionally so - yet, look at the entire work of Bette Davis and Joan Crawford as examples of contrived performances. They were, at last, able to confront one another in ""Baby Jane"" - attempting to ""out-drama"" one another made it the wonderful film it is.There is simply no other actress, that we know of, who is more talented a performer than Streep. Unlike Davis and Crawford, she is not concerned about her ""star-power"". She becomes whatever character she is playing, no matter if we like them or not. SO WHAT if ""Sophie's Choice"" was a vehicle to demonstrate her power? Please write another !! William Styron, stand forth ! Because of her absorption into her characters and the many nuances she developed in ""Choice"", take a look at ""The Deer Hunter"" to see how powerfully she played an un-extraordinarily plain woman perfectly. Under-playing a character, to make you believe people are actually like that, is the mark of a great actress.I ardently pray there will be another role for Ms. Streep - even in her older years - that will allow us to become totally engrossed, to get outside of our own lives, to become completely destroyed, delirious, shattered just for a couple of hours, to realize there is still such talent in the world - THAT WE CAN AFFORD TO WATCH, at least.....thank heavens for this magical film.....",Sophie's Choice
62,herbqedi,Riveting final third lifts otherwise tedious character study,4,10 June 2002,"Meryl Streep won best actress for giving a penetrating and complex portrayal of a woman whose guilt makes her postwar life a walking death. She is incredibly intense, occasionally inappropriately so, but always memorable. But, that intensity in combination with Kevin Kline's overplaying is hard to take at times.  Add in the slow pacing and you have an unpleasant, albeit well crafted, movie-watching experience.  Peter McNichol does his best to provide some irony and insights, and Josef Sommer's superb narration helps move things on a bit.  If you can stick with it, you will be rewarded by the unforgettable denouement.  It works as art much better than it works as entertainment.",Sophie's Choice
63,shepardjessica,Jessica Lange was Robbed!,3,7 July 2004,"How Meryl Streep beat out Jessica Lange for the Best Actress in 1982 is beyond me.  Once again, Streep pulls out one of her phony-baloney accents with the emotional range of a stuffed tortoise.  What do people see in this claptrap?  Stingo was well-cast, but as usual Kevin Kline was annoying, loud, pretentious, while eating the scenery.  What is with this guy? 
The fact that this was even nominated shows how bad the Academy had slipped by the early 80's.  Junk is junk.  Streep and Kline are portrayed as intellectual fun-loving free spirits, when they're really just a couple of neurotic con artists.  Forget this one!  I gave this a 3 because of the cinematography and Stingo.",Sophie's Choice

65,steven_torrey,"Sophie's Choice--Excellent film, excellent novel",10,29 June 2010,"Film is a different aesthetic experience than a novel. The film adaptation is fairly consistent with William Styron's novel. But a film must be completed within a short period of time--in this case the film is 150 minutes--2.5 hours. While a novel spends time developing characters, scenery, meditation on the topic--a movie supplies all of that on film. The viewer must interpret what is being seen on the film while the novelist must interpret with words what is being projected in the mind as background to support plot or themes. The reader or viewer must bring intellectual acumen to the aesthetic experience of reading or film viewing.Stingo is a case in point. As narrator of Sophie's story, the viewer or reader must see him as a flawed character. His sexual liaison with Sophie must be seen as him climbing an erotic sexual mountain. His taking notes of Sophie's story (in 1947) for a projected novel from which he will earn money must be seen as a cynical act, not entirely an act of devotion to Sophie. When Stingo claims Nathan is a genius, the reader/viewer must accept Stingo's assessment, an assessment reinforcing Stingo's flawed character. These events are apparent in the film and movie and the reader is expected to interpret these events.Actors read the film script, the novel, and interpret the words accordingly. And as somebody once said, acting is acting natural. It's not as easy as it looks and its why they earn huge salaries. And all the principals performed with excellence, without exception.It is a sad commentary when viewers get their history from film. The Holocaust was a real event, atrocities of this nature were a daily occurrence in Nazi Germany, Nazi concentration camps. For 6 million Jews (and many others) evil triumphed. This film is not a sentimentalization of the Holocaust as ""Schindler's List"" was or ""Life is Beautiful"" or ""The Pianist."" ""The Reader"" struck me as porno-horror--like the viewer needs any erotic association with the Holocaust. As a student, I learned of the Holocaust through Anne Frank, Bruno Bettleheim, Primo Levi, Viktor Frankl, Elie Wiesel, William Shirer; Styron's novel I read after seeing the movie and long after reading these other chroniclers.The novel has a greater density than the movie. It is a complex novel about redemption and judgment. Denied redemption and harsh judgment for Nazi perpetrators, redemption and judgment for victims, redemption and judgment for a Christianity which allowed for such racial hatred as an extension of its anti-Semitism created at Golgotha with the Crucifixion. When Stingo recites Emily Dickinson's poem at Sophie's funeral, at the end of the novel/film, this important thematic point is being made. He reads: ""Ample make this bed / Make this bed with awe / In it wait till judgment break / Excellent and fair."" In the novel he laughs uncomfortably then recites the second concluding stanza: ""Be its mattress straight / Be its pillow round / Let no sunrise's yellow noise / interrupt this ground."" There is a scene in the novel that is not in the movie. After he has sex with Sophie he sees her for the first time without her teeth, her makeup, her hair combed and he is truly frightened. And I realized that she was a vision of horror right out of Dante and the horrid sirens. There is always profound troubling element in writing or thinking about the Holocaust. In the novel, there are many allusions to redemption and judgment; density of the novel is lost in the simplicity of film media.",Sophie's Choice

67,mbrcf,"A dated, average film",5,15 December 2019,"I think this was one of the films that had one too many twists and turns to keep the story interesting. Many aspects of the film felt dated which is not good news for a film only 40 years old.I would say this was a pretty average movie which didn't really connect to me as a viewer, was a bit long (runtime is 150 minutes) and I was really happy when it was over.",Sophie's Choice
68,marissas75,Meryl Streep raises the bar,8,8 July 2006,"After enjoying Meryl Streep and Kevin Kline in the recent ensemble comedy ""A Prairie Home Companion,"" it was great to see their dramatic performances in ""Sophie's Choice,"" the movie that made them famous. Here, they play Sophie and Nathan, a volatile young couple living in a Brooklyn boardinghouse in the summer of 1947. Their story, and eventually the story of the Polish Sophie's time in a concentration camp during World War II, is presented through the eyes of Stingo (Peter MacNichol), their young Southern neighbor.Though other characters appear, especially during the flashbacks, ""Sophie's Choice"" is largely a three-person drama that relies on subtle interactions. Meryl Streep can always be counted on to give a nuanced performance, but here, especially, she raises the bar. Speaking three languages (including a very realistic portrayal of how foreigners can hesitate and hunt for words when speaking English), going from a haggard Auschwitz inmate to a pretty ""blooming rose,"" consumed by guilt even during the madcap or romantic moments she shares with Nathan, she gives a brilliant performance of a very complex character. Her big scenes with Nazi officers are of course powerful, but I was equally struck by smaller moments: the heartbreaking little flashes of emotion that reveal Sophie's postwar wounds, or the extraordinary conversation she has with a Nazi's daughter.Kline throws himself into the role of the ""fatally glamorous"" Nathan and also displays impressive range: he goes from charming to menacing. MacNichol is not up to these (admittedly high) standards. He can play the wide-eyed innocent, but he always seems somewhat thick-headed and lacking in passion. The movie would be more effective if Stingo seemed more truly changed by his experiences with Sophie and Nathan.Despite Stingo's weakness as a character, I liked the unusual structure that reveals Sophie's story gradually, in flashbacks that draw closer and closer to the ultimate horror. The movie is nicely shot and some of the Brooklyn scenes look as though they actually could have come from a 1940s movie. But no director from the 1940s would have confronted the brutalities of the Holocaust so directly, and few actresses from any era could have given a performance like Streep's.",Sophie's Choice
69,kevjfarrell,Meryl Streep's finest hour,10,15 February 2015,"This is the level of acting to set your standards to. Meryl is absolutely outstanding as this complex character. I have seen the movie a number of times now and it still takes me on an emotional roller coaster and lives with me for a long time after each viewing. I also get a lot more out of it each time I see it. The title of the movie obviously refers to one specific harrowing event for Sophie, but you get to see all Sophie's choices throughout her life and the consequences of her choices. Stunning cinematography. The flashbacks are well done and timed to perfection. The scriptwriting is first rate. The characters are for the most part very believable. The ending is the most poignant one of any movie I have ever seen. They put out flood warnings on the Mississippi when I watch it!!!! Despite the emotional outpouring, it is a must-see movie on many levels. I can't speak too highly of this movie. The first half hour is comparatively slow moving and an introduction to the characters, then after that it kicks in and keeps you mesmerized. Even if you only see this movie once, it will remain in your mind forever! A finer performance by an actress has never been recorded.",Sophie's Choice

71,laursene,Couldn't they have just found a Polish actress?,3,21 October 2008,"I'm baffled by the write-ups here. This is pure middle-brow soap opera, ""quality"" Hollywood at its dreariest. The writer-director and actors take themselves way too seriously, the three main characters and their interactions don't add up, and the ending comes out of nowhere. Holocaust-ploitation is too strong a word only because this is just too earnestly boring to tread those waters.Streep? It's a stunt, not a performance. We watch her to see whether her accents slip up, not for any warmth or magnetism or emotional intensity, like the kind that presumably captivated the two men in Sophie's life, because it's not there. Maybe a Polish actress could have brought some quality of a life actually lived to the character.Kline, who I've always found an overbearing presence, can't do much with a character whose antics probably made as little sense on the page as he does on the screen. ""Tragically glamorous""? More like cornily theatrical. As for MacNichol, an actor of no magnetism whatsoever, someone forgot to tell him that even when you're playing a boring nebbish, you have to bring something to the character that'll make the audience want to watch him mope around for two hours. He doesn't.The story is contrived, the various points of development - the revelations about Nathan from his brother, the denouement after Sophie leaves Stingo - feel like they exist only to move the plot along. Sophie's account of her tragedy in the camps feels like something trumped up to goose a wan story about a romantic threesome. Maybe this is Holocaust-ploitation after all.",Sophie's Choice
72,jchano123,"great cast, more of a character study",6,6 March 2017,"Sophie's Choice is a 1982 film directed by Alan J. Pakula, and based on the novel by William Styron. Meryl Streep, playing the titular role, was great in this. Her accent was incredibly convincing and she looked almost uncannily to Gillian Anderson in the late 90s, another favorite star of mine. The sets were very vividly colored and nice to look at. I also liked how the colors and cinematography changed to dark and gritty for the holocaust scenes, but bright and happy for the other scenes. For the most part the film felt relatively uneventful and more of a character study. It was very slow moving which could get tedious, but at the very least was entertaining because of the characters and their brilliant portrayals by the cast. I also found it bothersome that the film took an entire 90 minutes to actually feature get to the flashbacks of the holocaust. You could watch an entire other movie in that time. The sequences that actually feature Sophie's journey through the holocaust are incredibly made and perfectly acted, but since there are so few of them, they turn out to only be a small portion of the film.I also wish the film showed more of Sophie's struggles in the holocaust. For example, when she tells the story about stealing the ham for her mother, which consequently got her arrested, there is no flashback. The audience is told what happened instead of being shown. The scene worked well since Streep was great in telling the story and conveys great emotion in her voice, but I just would have liked to have seen what happened since movies are built around the concept of 'show, don't tell', and usually work better that way.One part I found inaccurate was Nathan's obsession with the Nazis and his insistence that they were never brought to justice. The film never goes as far as to mention the Nuremberg trials, which is exactly what the allies tried to do - bring the war criminals to justice. The trials happened in 1945 to 1946, and the film is set in 1947, so the public would have known of their existence by that time.There was a lot of swearing in this movie, however, I don't think they swore so much in the 1940s. We swear much more now because there's so much in movies and TV, which influences us today, but not nearly as much in the past.There are many great examples of the false hope of the holocaust in this film. After begging a commander she is serving, Sophie convinces him to release her son, but he never ends up keeping his word. This helped show the continual disappointment and betrayal of the holocaust. I also didn't understand the importance of the subplot where Sophie agrees to get a radio so she can help escape. She is caught by the commander's daughter and befriends her after fainting, but the scene doesn't go anywhere and their relationship isn't revisited. If anything it could be another example of false hope and failure in the holocaust, but since there are so many other examples of this in the film, such as the betrayal of never seeing her son, this subplot could have been taken out with no effect on the story. Additionally, the false hope was ultimately reflected and reinforced in the ending, where Sophie and Nathan commit suicide. The ending wouldn't have been as effective if this hadn't happened.Sophie's titular 'choice' was incredibly heartbreaking and hard to watch. This is attributable to the great directing and acting in that specific scene. The film leaves a lot to imagination. What else did Sophie go through? It leaves the viewer wondering why she survived, which was very effective. This film, in the end, brings up a very important point - not only Jews were victims of the holocaust. They played a big part in it, but there were many others who suffered just as much as them, and it is important they are represented.",Sophie's Choice
73,Jakeroo,One of the greatest performances by an actress I've seen.,9,28 November 1998,"The movie was superb: well written and directed, but the performance by Streep was overwhelming.  She certainly deserved the Oscar she got for this movie.",Sophie's Choice
74,rajah524-3,Sophie's Choices,10,9 February 2010,"I was a lot more ""neo-Freudian"" when I saw ""SC"" in the early '80s. I didn't write this then, but it's what I would have written, save for the notions about beliefs, values, interpretations and evaluations I picked up from cognitive theory in the '90s.Sophie's father taught her to value men (and their opinions) over women. A German (as opposed to Slavic) and Roman Catholic, Sophie's father left her with the absolutistic values of the Germans and Papists, including a ""final solution"" for those ""trouble-making"" Jews. That she chose as she did as a new captive in a hell she never expected to be part of makes perfect sense, then. That she later chose to try to save herself and her child by abasing herself to an authoritarian potential Rescuer, also makes sense. She is overwhelmed, confused and regressing to her childhood and the values she learned there.For the same reasons, it also makes sense that she would allow herself to be Rescued and then persecuted by a Victimizing knight on a white horse to her damsel in distress: Nathan presented himself as a man in authority. But he is also borderline-organized (not ""paranoid schizophrenic,"" though that might well have been the diagnosis applied in the late 1940s). Nathan is caught in an unconscious splitting of his values and belief – and all the interpretations of reality that result from his values and beliefs – between ""all good"" and ""all bad."" He cannot perceive others as being combinations of ""some good"" and ""some bad;"" he can only see them in black and white.Enter Stingo. Nathan initially evaluates him as ""all bad,"" but because he needs Sophie to continue to be both his victim and the soothing mother he didn't seem to have as a child, he acquiesces and re-evaluates Stingo. In short order, Nathan has seduced him into the service of maintaining his Rescue scheme with Sofie. And Nathan's Rescue scheme is to keep Sofie as far from experiencing and processing her awful memories as he can.Stingo may act upon his romantic attachment to her, but he allows Sophie to remember her hell and the choices she was forced to make to survive. Nathan sees the obvious romance in bloom and uses it to justify the continuation of his own program to keep him and his beloved as far from reality as he can. In the end, of course, he fails and has to activate his own ""final solution."" I don't know that Styron understood the Karpman Drama Triangle as well as this, but it's all here: Rescue the Victim. Persecute and Victimize; then Rescue and Victimize another. Be willing to be the Persecuted Victim to be Rescued. And Rescue the Persecuting Victimizer to maintain his alternately Rescuing presence.In whatever event, Styron did a bang-up job. Most of us will not have to negotiate our way through anything like the horror of the Holocaust. But we will surely deal with whatever challenges come our way with the tools we got from our early life experiences. ""SC"" is simply one of the most emotionally compelling presentations of such choice-making ever filmed.",Sophie's Choice
75,MyDarkStar,The definitive Meryl Streep,8,2 March 2002,"Without a doubt, Meryl Streep delivers the Greatest Performance By An Actress EVER - period.The performance is totally naked, where you can almost feel her sorrow come right out of the screen. For all of the heart wrenching scenes in this movie, you never once feel as though Streep is going over-the-top. That says alot for someone who spends just about half of the time in her scenes with a tear in her eye. Everything about her performance just seems so effortless and natural. This especially shows when she is speaking German flawlessly, or English with a very convincing Polish accent.The fact that Kevin Kline and Peter MacNicol are not completely lost in this movie says alot for their performances. Kline himself delivers a great performance of a man suffering from delusions and bi-polar syndrome. It is one of his greatest performances as well. Peter MacNicol plays the role of a character who pales in comparison to the other characters. MacNicol has the somewhat undesirable task of having to play the character who carries the least amount of baggage. He therefore might be overlooked, when viewing at the movie as a whole. However, MacNicol does a great job with the character, not trying to make more out of it than it is supposed to be. His role is very important to this movie.But the real story here is Streep. Her performance would be a stand out against any other performance in history. I honestly believe that. Streep just digs down deep here - delivering lines that just put a chill down your spine.",Sophie's Choice
76,binaryg,Truly Great and Important Film,10,11 March 2005,"Having a new, big screen, home theater system is giving me the chance to watch some of my old favorite films and see how they have held up over time. I was recently surprised at how strange the story in Manhattan seemed 26 years later. I wondered how Sophie's Choice might have aged. I remember being so moved by Meryl Streep's performance and by the story. I still feel the same urgency to be reminded of the Holocaust. Especially with the horrors and torture still so prevalent we still need to recall what happened not so long ago. Sophie's Choice is still as great as I remember it. Streep's performance is the greatest I have ever seen. The DVD comes with a ""Making of"" documentary which is so enlightening. This was an important project for everyone involved, from the author, the screenwriter, the director, the cinematographer, to the actors all cared about what they were doing in this film.",Sophie's Choice
77,atlihafsteinsson,"Shattering, and still soaring",8,17 July 2013,"Sophie's Choice is one of those films I always meant to watch, and finally got the chance. It is best to go into it with as little idea as to what it's about as possible, as it's a slow film with a lot of layers that get peeled off one by one. A young would-be-author from the South moves to Brooklyn and befriends his neighbors, the couple Nathan and Sophie. All three hit it off, but Nathan's bipolar tendencies do puncture their friendship at times. Sophie, however, is a calm soul as kind as she is tortured by her past in Auschwitz. As the author, Stingo, gets to know them better, he is also taken deeper and deeper into Sophie's past, where a hidden pain resides.Sophie's Choice brilliantly captures two polar opposite worlds. The colourful and tranquil Brooklyn is contrasted strikingly by a late 1930s Poland occupied by Nazis, where the colour drains so much out of the film that any further and it would be black-and-white. The present in Brooklyn is a good haven to have and catch our breath between glimpses into Sophie's horrible past.At the end of the day, in spite of the emotionally shattering story, Sophie's Choice is a story about hope and redemption. The performances certainly helped. Peter MacNicol and Kevin Kline are both wonderful as polar opposite personalities, united by a common love for literature.But Meryl Streep is utterly mesmerizing as Sophie. It's not for no reason that this was one of those Oscar-nominated performances of hers that gave that extra edge and got her the statue. All of Sophie's mannerisms, her accent, her speaking German and Polish, her searching for words in English to express what she wants to say, her restrained kindness, her pain; none of it overdone. The director even trusted Streep enough to take long shots with her as she gets into deep characterization. This is quite simply one of the finest female performances in cinema.I did fear, throughout the film, what exactly Sophie's choice was, and I was right, for it is a scene that crushes your heart. But the film comes together in the end and ends in an emotionally satisfying way in spite of everything. Steel yourself for an emotional journey and give Sophie's Choice a view, it's a film as uplifting as it is depressing, and unmissable for cinema buffs.",Sophie's Choice
78,jbuck_919,Book and movie,10,6 June 2002,"The cliche is that the movie is never better than the book.  This is sometimes not true.  I read Styron's novel after seeing this magnificent movie and was greatly disappointed.  The novel is overlong, clumsily written,  and lacking in subtlety.  It conveys little of the multidimensionality that Meryl Streep, who never made a greater movie, conveys, by, for instance, mastering long passages in perfect German and, I'm told by someone, near-perfect Polish.Another movie that is much better than the novel is ""Day of the Jackal."" In both cases the novels bludgeon where the movies entice.",Sophie's Choice
79,dunsuls-1,Finally seen and sadly should have been earlier,10,3 January 2012,"It's hard to believe I missed this great film till now.Meryl Streep as Sophie and Kevin Kline as Nathan and Peter MacNicol as Stingo are the focus of what appears to be a typical love triangle in the making set in 1947 Brooklyn.Stingo is a southern aspiring writer who moves to Brooklyn to launch his writing of the ""big""novel and meets Sophie and her lover Nathan who have a very tempestuous love life.Soon enough Stingo becomes ""best friend""of both and a weird triangle ensues.Simple enough,seen that,nothing special.The acting is fine and although we learn early on that Sophie is a survivor of a Nazi concentration camp,it seems to be little more than a post war love of life and experimental relationship film.POW !!! your hit like a ton of bricks when Sophie starts telling Stingo of her past after more problems with Nathan.Nathan it seems is obsessed with the Holocaust and frequently refers to Sophie and a whore and god knows how she survived the camps.The last hour or so is as powerful a attempt to illustrate in individual terms what happened to those who lived through the Holocaust and how they did,as I have ever seen on film without having real archive footage.Filmed in German dialect with subtitles to add to the realism its hard to watch and when you finally learn what ""Sophie's Choice""really was,well,I cried.I admit it,I did.The ending was a modern tragedy and the boy from the south learned what life was all about,perhaps.Its a long story but the characters are so well drawn and when the camp flashbacks begin you can't turn away and the film seems to end before it should.You want to know even more.",Sophie's Choice
80,andy-933-696608,Sophie's Choice Review,10,26 January 2011,"Everyone in this world has a choice, no matter what the situation is, and whatever decisions we make they are by our hands our hands alone. In the end of our self made choices we carry them on, living life with that knowledge. Sophie (Streep), a Polish immigrant had made so many choices in her life. These very decisions drove her to so much, and so little for other's to see. It doesn't really matter what others think, because the truth of the matter is that our decisions can't be influenced by anyone else. Only we have control. There are in fact times when we think our decisions were made by others rather than ourselves. It's a very common and very cowardly response, one which I rarely saw Sophie exhibit through the course of this film. The film starts with the narrations of Stingo (MacNicol) a young and curious writer hoping to complete his work, as he moves to a small apartment in Brooklyn. Upon his arrival he easily befriends a pair of lovers named Sophie and Nathan (Kline). Sophie, a Polish Catholic who's own survival of the Holocaust baffles her, and Nathan, a Jewish/supposed biologist, with even greater mysteries surrounding him. On and off he goes crazy on Sophie, exhibiting anger beyond control, inexplicably accusing her of infidelity, and even mocking her surprising survival of one of the world's darkest moments. Meryl Streep portrays a truly tormented character who is suffering, but not just from her own experience in Auschwitz, but at the deepest corners of her soul lingers the memory of the most difficult and haunting decision she'd ever made. Upon her arrival in the camp, her presence as a Catholic Polack had given her an opportunity at life. In the control of a typically perverted Nazi guard, her fate was made with the choice of which of her two children may live, and who may die. A decision, no parent can possibly or even put any sense into considering. Unfortunately, out of her desperation to end that very moment of stress riddled insanity, her daughters' life is declared to be over. Her son's life wasn't to last very long either. Sophie could not know, being on one side of the camp, while her only remaining child lived in a disease infested section of the children's zone. In the time she had opened herself to Stingo, the attempt she made to take her life, can only further describe her anguish, as well as her still remaining motivation to live on. Nathan, a man who's brilliance is very unique, whether it's in the manner of which he expresses himself philosophically, or in the thrilling and quite often humorous persona he uses to define himself. His very existence alone is Sophie's reason for living. Despite his flawed personality, and even surprisingly revertible emotional expressions (all a result of later discovered Schizophrenia), Sophie remains with him. To many of us viewers were going to ask ourselves, why. Why doe she stay with a man that can be so kind one minute, and so dangerous the next minute? It's hard for most people to understand, because obviously the 2 lovers have a very odd relationship. Maybe their relationship is suitable for their inner demons. Sophie battles her grief and remorse of her children, and Nathan lives with the lies of hiding his disorder, while constantly battling it at hand. The main truth of this film revolves around more than just Sophie's past choices, but it also focuses on her current decision to remain with a man who is as equally damaged as she is. That's probably what defines their spiritual connection for one another, their inner torment. Together, to the eyes of Stingo, and even viewers they seem perfectly happy, and they probably are when together, but when separate and without each other, their worst feelings of inner misery are truly expressed up to the point when both of these intriguing characters meet their own self destructive ends at the hands of a cyanide injection. The loss of his beloved friends, with whom he learned and bonded with so much, results n Stingo's departure from Brooklyn, leaving the very home where many fond, but painful memories will lie. It is through the narrations of his older self, that Stingo tells us the story of a moment in his life where he discovered so much. Through the kindness of Sophie and Nathan, he learned a sense of friendship that seemed truer than any bond he had with anyone else. His own feelings for Sophie, as well as his loss of virginity with her, made him further see clearly in the end, as he narrates this event as if it were an actual written story. Using a tone of calm and yet sophisticated expression, he tells his greatest and most fulfilling moment in life with such tender love and gratefulness. In fact I myself feel this film is very heart warming, using the theme of a tormented persons guilt to further explain the reasons for her choices. Meryl Streep is a tremendous actress, making her character so authentic, with not just her mastery of fluent German and Polish, but also with the very mannerisms of the character's crucially damaged and still benevolent persona. Kevin Kline brings the thrilling nature of his character with such ecstatic behavior using his intelligence, anger, wild humor, and desire to live life with joy and excitement to the best of his own definition. ""Sophie's Choice"" is what I call a very rare and powerful movie to view, using both the elements of tragedy, drama, and love to further guide viewers into the real nature of this film's title.",Sophie's Choice

But the performances by Kevin Kline and Peter MacNicol enhance the awesome portrayal by Ms. Streep, of a woman faced with a series of difficult choices, one of which should be unimaginable, but sadly is not.

83,jjh6519,Best Acting by a Female EVER,10,10 March 2000,"Meryl Streep has received a number of accolades and awards for her acting over the years, possibly the best being that many of the younger actresses have publicly proclaimed Meryl as their role model.  But you need not see any other movie than Sophie's Choice to see why she has been so universally acclaimed.  This is no doubt the best single featured acting by a female in any single movie, similar to Robert DeNiro's in Raging Bull or Taxi Driver. Meryl's Sophie is a person who is naive, jaded, innocent, guilt stricken, soft and gentle, hard as nails, loving and giving, and both practical and poetic to a fault.  She is a classic tragic figure, a lesson in how to deal with the horrors of life and how not to deal with how those horrors haunt you.  She is funny, soft and sweet, and you want to put your arms around her. Then you realize that underneath that childlike woman is a woman who has given up on childhood.  She is a study in contradictions, speaking English, German, and Polish to survive at all costs.  Then along comes Nathan, expertly portrayed by Kevin Kline (possibly one of his most challenging and multi-layered roles), and her life takes another turn.  But we see all this through the wondering, innocent eyes of Stingo, and the terror, love, laughs, friendship and alienation he experiences, we experience.  This is primarily due to a fantastic portrayal of Sophie by Meryl.  And yes, the key scene -- The Choice of Choices -- is possibly the most painful scene ever on film, and how Meryl interprets Sophie during this scene is, by itself, worth an award!  I love this movie.  Someone once saw it for the first time, and commented, ""I didn't think I would like it, especially because it was such a downer at times.  But it was so good!"" Excellent summary.",Sophie's Choice

But this is not the issue.This movie is about Meryl Streep.I can only highly recommend it to all aspiring actresses, just to see the best actress from the 1980's up until now in an overwhelming performance! After that, the bigger part of the audience will admit that she is simply a class of its own, with maybe one or two other actresses from the past on a par.How does Streep achieve such a presence, such an intensity? How does she act without giving the expression that she's impersonating? How does she convince us that she really IS Sophie, really IS Silkwood, really IS the French Lieutenant's Woman?Go watch much more of her oeuvre, to plainly see the marvels of the goddess of acting, for long times still to be the brightest star of her métier.",Sophie's Choice

The plot is well-crafted, and will keep you guessing until the end.  The film is not entirely without flaws; for instance, there was at least one scene that could have been completely removed, and the depiction of the concentration camp was soft-pedalled.

91,fluffyclown,Emotionally devastating to see,8,19 July 2004,"********Warning, Possible Spoilers*********I will start this review by saying that I watched this movie for one reason, and one reason only.  Meryl Streep.I have admired this woman since I first saw her in 1985 in the film,  Out Of Africa.  Even though I was only a teenager, I recognized that Meryl had a gift.  She could touch the heart of even the toughest critic with her amazing abilities.  I was aware that she had been in previous films, so over the years I have tried to catch up on her work that I had missed.  I didn't realize until a short time ago that Sophie's Choice was the only film I hadn't seen.  So, I rented the video, snuggled up with my hubby and some popcorn, and settled in for the evening to watch this much acclaimed film.Boy, was I ever taken for a ride!  I had no idea that the movie was about a woman who had survived a concentration camp.  I thought, (because of the picture on the cover of the video) that this was a movie about a woman having to choose between two men.  At certain points I almost gave up on the film, because it seemed to drag at points, and then throw unexpected curves at me that I couldn't quite follow.  I just couldn't understand why Meryl was having such a difficult time choosing to stay with Kevin Kline, because Peter MacNichol seemed like such a geek I could hardly stand him.  I firmly believed that she was out of her mind when she told decided to go to the farm with MacNichol.  Then I discovered what choice she truly had too make. I was absolutely devastated emotionally after that scene.  I had to stop the film for a full ten minutes before I could bear to watch the rest.  I could hardly sleep that night either, myself being a mother of two children; one a boy, age seven, and a girl, age 19 months.  I was tormented by the thought of what I would do or say if faced with the same choice.  I could never have forgiven myself no matter what choice I made, just as she could not.So now I understand what Sophie's Choice was all about.  Overall, I thought the movie could have transitioned from scene to scene better, so that the viewer would not have been so completely horrified and taken by surprise when the true ""choice"" was revealed.  Had I seen this movie in the theater, I would have completely missed the ending because I was so shaken by the previous climactic scene.  But as far as Meryl is concerned, 10+++++++ in my book.

92,thowen1988,An example of an excellent actress,10,19 October 2006,"""Sophie's Choice"" is a vivid portrayal of the human side of World War II and the holocaust. The setting is post-World War II, late 1940s Brooklyn, New York.Meryl Streep is Sophie Zawistowski, a Polish immigrant. This is the movie that caused all of us to fall in love with Ms. Streep. Her performance is impeccable. In some scenes, she is flawlessly dressed, and absolutely beautiful, while in others she is completely dehumanized at the hands of the Nazi Germans, and yet Meryl Streep is completely convincing throughout the film. Her accent sounds genuine, and you feel Sophie's pain throughout the movie.Kevin Kline is Nathan Landau, Sophie's mentally unstable boyfriend who meets her in Brooklyn. Kline's performance as the 'Jekyl and Hyde' Nathan is ominously realistic. Peter MacNicol is Stingo, a naive young writer from the South who moves into the same building as Sophie and Nathan. Stingo soon learns the secrets Sophie and Nathan have been keeping from each other.This movie will keep you on the edge of your seat. The acting is brilliant, especially by Meryl Streep.

93,Jen_UK,The finest performance by an actress in the history of film.,9,28 December 2001,"'Sophie's Choice' should be compulsory viewing for any member of the voting panel who decide Academy Award winners. Quite simply, Meryl Streep's performance is THE benchmark for that 'Best Actress' category. I've seen a LOT of films, but not one performance has ever (and will ever) match her's. The manner in which she embodies Sophie goes beyond explanation. It is too accomplished and moving for words. It is almost offensive to think that Julia Roberts was awarded the same statue for Erin Brockovich'!Aside from the breathtaking central performance from the marvellous Ms Streep, there are so many other reasons to see this film. Kevin Kline and Peter MacNicol are excellent, the cinematography is beautiful (particularly the shots of Brooklyn Bridge) the score is haunting ... I could go on.Although certain critics have berated 'Sophie's Choice' as a mere platform for Meryl Streep as an actress, I urge you to overlook this view. The film succeeds admirably in bringing to horrific life an event in history which we should all be made aware of. It is undeniable that the phenomenal performance of MS leaves you spellbound, but NOT at the expense of being horrified and affected by what you have seen. All I can say to sum up is: just see it. An intelligent and profoundly moving film which will (I promise you) live on in your memory long after the closing credits.",Sophie's Choice

Sophie's Choice dares to show us those true horrors of life. Kevin Kline was also incredible with his portrayal of someone with a schizophrenic disorder before the time when that sort of thing was recognized. Peter MacNicol had an easy, but still memorable performance.

the choice of Sophie's (my big spoiler) is near the end and it's a flashback as a Nazi officer gives her the choice of which one of her two children she will save from death and which she will choose to give up and after she says in tears ""I can't!"" she says ""My daughter! Take my little baby!"" and you get to see the poor girl crying so horribly.What a nightmare - that I spent all this time watching this, that is.Kevin Kline plays a man we find out who is suffering from a form of schizophrenia (I forget which kind his brother says) and Sophie doesn't know this.That's another spoiler.Oh, and - what a name.....""Stingo"", he tells Sophie how he always loved her in the last half hour and, absolutely *no* chemistry jives with this.This was the most *boring* movie I have just about ever seen, although clearly there were moments that kept me awake, although I felt my eyes closing with around a half hour left - Good God, this movie is just Terrible, with a capital T.Avoid this by all means,

97,anupam-satyasheel,Life as an ordeal of traumas,8,5 April 2007,"Sophie's Choice is a very powerful story of a woman whose strength did not desert her in imaginably some of the most traumatic moments in a person's life. Whether it was her abysmal life in German concentration camps or her Brooklyn existence with her schizophrenic boyfriend, Sophie did not have much to fall back up on with the exception of her inner core - a core that was so solid that it did not falter, did not waver, did not even flinch as she lost everything that a human heart deems precious. In the end she appears calm and poised even after having lost what every one holds dearest to heart - life.In her Academy winning performance, Meryl Streep is peerless. Arguably it is one of the most powerful and yet sublime performances ever - an incredibly realistic portrayal of a character whose numerous shades of existence are impossibly difficult to depict. Streep delivers what easily can contend for an Academy among Academy winners.

It is, hands down, the most disturbing, upsetting, horrific scene in movie history...and it will rattle you to your core. The first time I saw was during a college Philosophy class. Afterwards I was furious...furious at the professor for showing it, furious at the filmmakers for making it, and furious at the Nazis for, well, everything. I was even furious at Sohpie for choosing. Now, years later, I'm not angry anymore. I have children of my own - a boy and a girl - and I feel sick anytime I think about this film. My heart aches for Sophie and anyone who might have really been through that at the hands of the Nazis. If you want true, bone-chilling horror, then look no further.

She fully lived upto the hype, but not the movie. It is a drag, and not because it is 2.5 hours long. The screenplay is terrible. Nothing happens for about half hour, except the threesome having fun.This topic is worthy of so much more. The only interesting parts were in the Holocaust related scenes, and Streep was absolutely brilliant in them. She plays a completely different personality effortlessly in other scenes. Her Polish accent seems perfect (I have just two Polish friends).Even though one character is telling the story, the focus should have been on Sophie's past, and not so much on her present. Just when the movie starts getting interesting, we are thrown back to the present situation, which is a total waste of time, in my opinion. The ending made no sense to me at all.The acting by the top three actors (one of them Meryl Streep) was very good, but the screenplay just about ruined the whole movie for me.I would still recommend that people see this movie, only to see Meryl Streep's brilliance as an actress.

Also it's sad to think of her in Devil Wears Prada and other far inferior works today.Perhaps Sophie's Choice was the best performance she will ever do. However I agree with most of the other reviewers that say that Streep's character in Sophie's Choice is the greatest role for an actress in film history. In short, everything else Streep does in her life will never measure up to this performance.None of the modern crop of A-list actresses (or actors - a more pejorative term to me) like Anne Hathaway, Angelina Jolie, Charleze Theron or frankly anyone else could be taken seriously doing a role like this.

Her work as Sophie is monumental and heartbreaking, and while it is a calculated performance, it is still very intriguing to watch.The film also contains great performances by Kevin Kline and Peter MacNichol. Both were robbed of Oscar nominations and Kevin Kline would have gotten my vote for Best Supporting Actor had he been nominated.With these great performances, ""Sophie's Choice"" is escalated to classic movie status and makes it worth the watch. However, the movie does drag at times and can lose its luster, but thankfully, the work put into the film saves it and keeps it afloat.The film deserved Best Picture and Director nominations as well, and a lot of this is credited to the team behind the scenes and the actors who made the movie work even in the slower scenes.

104,badman-2,Character study of two people haunted by demons,7,1 February 1999,"I enjoyed this film very much but somehow I felt that something was lacking about it.  From the name of the film, a viewer would assume that the film was about a choice that a woman named Sophie made.  Indeed, when the final credits roll, a viewer understands how Sophie's present life and subsequent death were affected and brought on by the awful choice that no parent should ever have to make.However, the film is 2 1/2 hours long.  We don't learn of Sophie's choice until the last 15 minutes of the film.  In fact, if it wasn't for the title, I wouldn't of thought that the film was about a choice at all.  The film was about two people that came together because they share one thing: they're both ""haunted"" by inner demons.  Nathan is haunted by natural causes; he's a paranoid schizophrenic.  And of course Sophie is haunted by the ""choice"" that she had to make years earlier.  We see these two ""haunted"" people through the eyes of a 22 yr old stranger who quickly becomes the couples best friend.I'm not saying Sophie's Choice was bad or that I didn't like it.  It kept my attention for 2 1/2 hours, which is impressive.

While we really became to understand the characters, the only one we really needed to relate to was Sophie. The preamble could have been reduced significantly and the tragedy in the Camp could have been played out longer.Such a story, such a tragedy, and I really am left trying to decide whether the film was about the victims of the Nazi's or a twisted romance.

That's a much more interesting subject than what they went with.Throw in how quick the titular and pivotal scene is and the movie is simultaneously plodding and rushed. And the jarring back and forth between her second choice of Stingo or Nathan. I'm not a psychiatrist, but I got whiplash in the back and forth.

With that being said, the movie title is a bit misleading --- In my humble opinion, It was not a singular choice Sophie made but many choices. Some viewers of this movie contend that Sophie's choice was the one she made to save her son over her daughter. The title is deceptive and leads the viewer to conclude it that way with little effort on the viewer to go beyond that.Sophie is rifled with choices. Stingo vs. Nathan, life versus death (during the war and in its aftermath). Be loyal to her dad's worldview and that of her husband, or support their enemy. Be truthful in her post as Nazi aid and secretary, or save herself from certain extermination.

Streep (about whom I know little) shows here why she is so highly respected as an actress, there are moments here where she manages to show - through her expression - every nuance of feeling contained within individual lines of a tale recounted but without going anywhere near over-egging it. You truly believe she is recalling her experience and conveying it, there appears to be no artifice at all - though, rationally, we know that it is all it is.Kevin Klein is great as an energised, spontaneous man - playing his role in such a way that we learn more about him we are as surprised as we should be, but immediately can see the truth of the revelation as to his behaviour.It took me far too long to place the man in the lead role, until I suddenly realised I was looking at the ""Perkipsy""(sp?) lawyer from Ally Macbeale. Again, a great performance of a young man having some kind of rite of passage or formative experience.These three performances make the tragedy of the tale all the more powerful, and when we finally discover what Sophie's ""choice"" was it does as much as a film can do to move us and think about those who were forced to make such decisions in reality.It only misses out on having 10 stars because I am a tight git, and will only award ten to those special films I know I will watch again and again, which tend to be more idiosyncratic than this.",Sophie's Choice

So much has been written already about her flawless depiction of Sophie, who has to be the most heartbreaking character ever seen on film; I can only add my support to the view that Streep here gives the best performance ever seen by an actor.Additionally, I agree that the Academy should look at this performance as the watermark of the Best Actress Oscar. Inevitably, no one will ever match it, but to think Gwyneth Paltrow won the same award for her role in ""Shakespeare in Love"" is laughable.Kevin Kline is brilliant as the chilling yet endearing Nathan, whilst Peter MacNicol is the character whose superb narration and acting transmits us into the movie.I noticed that the morose Pauline Kael, the most ludicrously over-respected film critic of all time, once again shows her cynicism in finding much fault with the movie: I will have none of it: it is utterly moving, without having to resort to cliché or overloud, haunting music to influence our emotions. Quite simply, the subject matter - Sophie's tragic life and (in)ability to come to terms with what has happened to her - is enough to do this on its own.The final frame is to me, perhaps the most beautiful I have ever seen, and the film will stay with the viewer long after.",Sophie's Choice

Nevertheless he seems to be a good caring boyfriend. Stingo is obviously having a crush on Sophie. Three of them hang out in urban Broklyn, and except that Sophie does have a thick Polish accent and Nathan is a US born Jewish, this so far does seem like a romantic story.Meryl Streeps does an amazing in imitating the accent, and exquisite acting skills really got me into her Polish Sophie character a lot.The story took a turn when the secrets & lies of Sophie and Nathan came out slowly. Even though the movie is set in the US but the whole story plot is in fact more about the tragedy and truths about Jewish prosecution, concentration camps and making life choices for survival.One thought I got out of this movie is, human can lie so much, lifes become truths and subsequently, we can no longer tell lies and truths apart.",Sophie's Choice

Brilliantly directed and acted, this is a must watch for any of the history buffs who enjoy this genre. One of the finest for sure. A delightful little chemistry between the narrator and Streep holds the movie together whenever it gets a tad stretched and doesn't let you get bored as it gets weary at times.

137,cmdimovich,a movie allowing you to observe all sides,8,12 December 2005,"The heart-breaking scene of Sophie's choice that has been deeply wounded in her is the largest and most overbearing guilt she's contained her whole life since that decision. Being forced to a choice where either decision would demand the life of one of her children. Does this make Sophie a murderer to her child? She goes on believing so. In a totalitarian form of evil she was forced, had no way to avoid this choice, and could not use herself as a substitute for her children's lives. If she had to choose between the loss of her son or the loss of her daughter with no option otherwise, the loss of one her children was inevitable, such a choice is completely terrifying and unfathomable as well as questionable for who is held accountable for the fatal consequences. Sophie believes the fatal decision is her fault, a declaration of bad motherhood, and has guilt beyond known.Sophie's history involves so many layers, adding onto the death of her daughter. Sophie grew up in Poland with a father who could be described as a horrible, abusive (psychologically and physically), racist person of the time during and after World War Two towards Sophie and her family. Sophie hated her father, and tried to hide this hate inside of her. Sophie's exposure of being raised with such abuse and cruelty set a foundation for other cruelties and violence to become part of life in the future. Sophie is victimized to the point where she accepts and receives abuse, and is returned with guilt on her shoulders.Sophie is put into a concentration camp, Auschwitz, because of actions her father took. Isn't a father or parents figure supposed to one of compassion and love? She goes to Auschwitz with her two children by no choice given otherwise, even though she is Catholic and Polish not Jewish. When she gets off the train full of people sent to Auschwitz, she is given no decision of losing a child but is given the choice between one or the other. The horror and terror of the Holocaust is so hard to comprehend and understand the minds of those in control, Nazi Germany. The soulless cruelties, death, and torments of the concentration camp became greatly wounded in Sophie, as well as mankind over the world during that time and even today. Post-traumatic stress disorder (PSD) is usually talked about soldiers who have survived wars. Sophie being exposed to such horrific and unforgettable surroundings of the Holocaust could easily cause PSD. The Holocaust being so horrible makes it so hard to talk about and to have exposed after surviving such terror, Sophie found it hard to talk about and let the experience out, that she kept these images and secrets in her head and part of her guilt for living.When Sophie was freed from Auschwitz, she was delicate physically and emotionally. She was very sick and very depressed. She met Nathan, an attractive and charming man, who showed her love and compassion and all that was absent from her life at that time. She lost her family and both children and then, with the come back of Nathan, he seemed like her savior and a reason of why she had survived the Holocaust when so many had not. Nathan was very smart, charismatic, enthusiastic, loving, and also erratic for both the good and the bad. Nathan would be the love of all life, then snap into a horrible and cruel person who became violent and said the most spiteful and personal things towards Sophie. Nathan suffered from schizophrenia and the delusions that everyone and everything was out for him. He blamed Sophie for cheating on him with their best friend, Stingo, he yelled at Sophie violently, and was brutal towards Sophie in a way that was completely out of character for Nathan. Nathan was also involved in cocaine, which is known for making delusions and schizophrenic symptoms worse and more prominent. Sophie is unaware of Nathan's sickness and drug use, that she gave reasons of his violent actions towards her, and place blame upon his actions on the basis of having a bad day or other things not within his control including her. Sophie had a secret from Nathan as well. She never talked to him about the personal issues she dealt with as a child, mother, and being at Auschwitz. She shared such love and happiness that she had never been able to experience with someone with Nathan, but never told of her personal wounds, inner hurt and devastating secrets. These deep and unhindered upsets have been boiling inside of Sophie. When she met Stingo and got to know him further and further, she opened up wider and wider, and embraced her inner conflicts when sharing them with Stingo.The history of Sophie's stress of being beaten, tortured, abused by her own family and love was all out if her control. Sophie did not get to choose her father. She did not get the choice of being brought into the concentration camp. She didn't have the option of saving her children's lives. She could not control the relationship between her and Nathan because of Nathan's uncontrollable mental illness of schizophrenia causing his bi-polar behaviors. Sophie was placed into these situations and dealt with them and kept as head strong as possible. The one decision she had control over in the end, she preferred the less rewarding, but maybe to her it fit. Was this in her nature in accepting the less rewarding? Was it her guilt? Did being victimized depict her expectations? I agree with all of these, and in how these shaped her reflections of her life outcomes.",Sophie's Choice

141,shmeedleberg,Hoess as assembly-line death merchant family man,10,24 January 2005,"Rudolf Hoess, Kommandant Auschwitz 1940-43, is very interestingly portrayed here in my opinion. I had often wondered as to whether or not this once-devout Catholic suffered any misgivings during his reign at the well-concealed killing factory Auschwitz, and having read the majority of Herman Wouk's ""War and Remembrance,"" recalling his reaction to the girl with the apple blossoms, was this fact or fiction? His subsequent testimony at the Nuremberg Trials revealed something of a man who could care less one way or the other, about the war or any such thing. To my understanding Hoess's residence was several miles from the actual camp, but in ""Sophie's Choice"" it's separated from the camp by a high wall. Frau Hoess and young Emmi appear to be as ardent Nazis as the Kommandant himself. Baldur von Schirach and Gertrud Scholz-Klink must have had a field day with Emmi, a deutsche Maedel if ever was. There seems to be genuine love and affection between Hoess and his wife, the way they seem completely at ease with one another. He also is quite civil towards Sophie, business-minded and somewhat unsure of himself. THEN all of a sudden he flips his nut. I don't think it would have mattered if Hitler was in the room instead of Sophie, with a migraine attack like that he'd have still curled up with a pillow. I am of the opinion that Hoess was probably an insomniac, although I can't say for certain. To live in such luxurious surroundings with his loving family adjacent to, well, Auschwitz-Birkenau with its most unpleasant atmosphere, would have some kind of an effect on even the most heartless ruthless bureaucratic SS-Mann.",Sophie's Choice
142,sabahataijaz,Pure cinematic intoxication!,7,11 May 2005,"Director Alan J. Pakula's film, a departure from his conspiracy and suspense dramas, is an adaptation of William Styron's best-selling novel of the same name. The story itself is based on his experiences as a southerner living in Brooklyn in 1947.Pakula essentially preserves the structure of Styron's novel as it begins with the arrival of Stingo, an aspiring young writer, in post - WWII Brooklyn. After settling into a boarding house, he meets a unique couple that offers him alternating support and heartbreak.He befriends the Jewish biologist, Nathan (Kevin Kline), and his girlfriend, Sophie Zawistowska (Meryl Streep), a Polish refugee and Auschwitz survivor. But their relationship is clouded by Nathan's violent behaviour, his uncontrollable jealousy, and Sophie's unexpressed but troubling memories of war. Her stories about her life during the war begin to unravel, exposing her as a liar and adding a tone of mystery to the relationship between Nathan, Stingo, and herself. The film culminates in a flashback, reflecting the horrors of the war and the true cause of Sophie's insufferable pain and the bitter choice she had to makeStreep deservedly won an Oscar and a Golden Globe for Best Actress, bringing on the tears, playing both a naive girl and a worldly woman, transforming herself into a Holocaust victim and survivor. Speaking flawlessly in a Polish accent and acceptable German, she basically became Sophie Zawistowska.And while Streep is undoubtedly the star, both Kevin Kline and Peter MacNicol deserve credit for making 'Sophie's Choice' work as well as it does.While overall this is Stingo's coming of age story, at its central core we get drawn into Sophie's saga. Pakula uses an Emily Dickinson poem to frame her story: Ample make this bed.Make this bed with awe; In it wait till judgment break excellent and fair. Be its mattress straight, be its pillow round; Let no sunrise' yellow noise interrupt this ground.The reference to the bed is the key to understanding Sophie's persona. She relies on Nathan's physical love, even as he abuses her, to cope with her Auschwitz ghosts. Nestor Almendros' delicately lit cinematography, with its complex levels of saturation and subtle impositions of shadow, has often been meticulously replicated. The flesh tones are perfect, the image is solid and the colours, when in full bloom, are exquisitely formed. Equally effective is the use of music created by Marvin Hamlisch. Two themes are effectively intertwined throughout the story  both melancholic.Though the film deals with the Holocaust, it doesn't graphically show Nazi horrors, but rather refers to them abstractly, making it more effective. 'Sophie's Choice' provides the emotional core of the horror and shows what devastating experiences the survivors must deal with. For Pakula, the film was an artistic highpoint and his most deeply felt work. Undoubtedly, 'Sophie's Choice' remains his most powerful, highly distinctive drama.",Sophie's Choice
143,lucyedwards-34776,Fantastic and Thought Provoking,9,14 June 2016,"I have only now seen this brilliant film, and found myself watching it again immediately after to ""watch"" the flashbacks with greater concentration.I thought that Meryl Streep (Sophie), Kevin Kline (Nathan) and Peter MacNicol (Stingo) all played their roles brilliantly, and despite many negative comments relating to the character Stingo being slightly weak, I feel that this was important in demonstrating his naivety and with this the great contrast between the friends.As somebody in their mid thirties I can also relate to the characters,; and their lifestyle, despite being several generations apart.",Sophie's Choice
144,artoffilmorg,Christmas with Sophie 2017,10,26 December 2017,"I don't know why I didn't want to see Sophie's Choice, not for years. I knew about Meryl Streep's performance, Alan J Pakula. Kevin Kline and I also knew that I had to see it eventually. Well, Christmas 2017 brought the shattering story into my life and now forever in my subconscious. Extraordinary is the first word that comes to mind. Meryl Streep's performance is out of this world. Every detail in her creation is a sort of link to her heart and therefore to mine. ""Emil Dickens?"" Her eyes, asking the question to the awful librarian will stay with me forever. Meryl Streep as Sophie asked that question 35 years ago. Amazing! What a devastating treat. It will make me go back to see all of her films., specially ""A Cry In The Dark"", ""Plenty"", ""The Bridges Of Madison County"" ""Julia and Julia"" even ""Death Becomes Her"" and ""The Devil Wears Prada"" Thank you Meryl Streep, thank you very much.",Sophie's Choice

146,cmartin-33,A career defining role!!!,10,14 December 2006,"Arguably Meryl Streep's most compelling performance...and lord knows the woman has turned in a few during her career! I found myself delighted, beguiled, enchanted, crushed and ultimately reduced to a drained and empty shell by the film's end; it took several days thereafter to fully recover. Her vulnerability and honesty are as inescapable as her demons. And you cannot help but be drawn into such a real sense of both conflict & compassion, duty and despair...this film completely melted my face off while cementing an admiration and awe I rarely experience from an actor's performance. All due respect to both Kline & MacNichol for their fine portrayals, but really the movie begins and ends with Streep's haunting, brilliant and enormously human turn as Sophie! This is a ""must see"" film albeit a gut wrenching experience!!! Totally amazing!!!",Sophie's Choice
147,dkmjones,Kevin Kline and Meryl Streep are perfect!,10,10 May 2000,"Very powerful film. This film is all about the acting. Even Peter MacNicol is perfect as the young, naive and good-hearted Stengo. The story is told from his eyes as he befriends and becomes entwined in the lives of Kline's Nathan and Streep's Sophie. It's not the most pleasant topic or the easiest film to watch, but it's well worth it. Now if Kevin Kline would pick his roles a little more selectively and do more like this, he could become one of Hollywood's greatest actors of all time.",Sophie's Choice
148,LauraDP-2,I believe this is the best movie ever made.,10,2 January 2001,"""Sophie's Choice"" is a breathtaking work of art.  This movie is stunning not just for Meryl Streep's award winning performance, which I think is the best of her career, but for the performances of all of the actors involved as well as all of the other elements (screenplay, cinematography etc.) that go into creating a film.  This film is a Michaelangelo.",Sophie's Choice
149,n.mcpheat,A first class film,10,21 January 2001,"I first watched this film on TV approximately 12 years ago.Having watched it in 2001 on DVD, I gained an even greater respect for this superb movie. The acting is first class, the story intriguing and the characters are strong and deep.Meryl Streep gives the performance of her life and displays emotions at both ends of the spectrum.If you have not seen the film then sit back and enjoy!",Sophie's Choice
150,abtinrashedi,Great actress,5,5 December 2020,"The film is more about the writer... and his story is not as interesting as Sophie's story could be.
I think if the story was about Sophie's life with the epic act of Meryl Streep as leading actress... this film would be one of the greatest masterpiece of cinema.",Sophie's Choice
151,Poeticchick,The movie that touched my heart,10,22 October 2001,"This movie was made a little before I was born and the first time I seen it, I was too young to understand. Then, recently, I have to watch a movie for my humanities film research paper. My mom suggest to me ""Sophie's Choice"" and I was touched. Meryl Streep was a superb actress, she knows the character from the inside out. Peter MacNicol was a natural too, I cannot imagine anybody else who can portray Stingo like he does. Kelvin Kline was a amazing new actor of that time. I am glad I seen it and I suggest if anyone needs a thoughtful movie, see ""Sophie's Choice"".",Sophie's Choice
152,calladia,"""Powerful"" does not even begin to describe this movie.",10,5 March 2002,"From the script/plot content to the cinematography to the unbelievable talent displayed by every single actor involved, this movie is the best of what film can be.  No matter how long it has been since my last viewing, Sophie comes to me and haunts me with her sadness, her desperation and her ache to rid herself of her pain.  One of the best films ever made.",Sophie's Choice
153,wmiyd,Dickinson Mistake,10,2 September 2008,"The lines quoted by Stingo at the end of the film are NOT from Dickinson's poem ""Because I Could Not Stop For Death"", but from poem 1337, ""Ample Make This Bed"". The latter poem can be found at Bartleby's, here: http://www.bartleby.com/113/4063.html. It's part of her ""Time and Eternity"" canticle. Here's the poem ""Because I Could Not Stop for Death"" which clearly doesn't contain ANY of the words recited by Stingo: http://www.bartleby.com/113/4027.html. As anyone can see, both poems are part of the same CYCLE, but one is NOT part of the other and if you went searching for ""Because I Could Not Stop for Death"", you wouldn't find the words quoted in the film. That could be REALLY frustrating, quite apart from the fact that the statement just isn't accurate.",Sophie's Choice
154,fjodorii,A deep look into the psychological side of the Holocaust.,8,3 July 2008,"A deep look into the psychologically immeasurable dark, ice-cold and silent side of the Holocaust drama. The angle of incidence focuses on two different sides of the drama: the Jewish side and the Christian side. For Christians, the movie has particularly the merit of reminding Christians why, and when, they did NOT want to take the place of the Jew (in spite of a theology which has so often been greedy to loot their position). Meryl Streep (Sophie) plays indeed a grandiose role, making the anguish on the Christian side of the drama frightening. It may also make the non-Christian understand how much Christians have been in the almost front lines of the attack - just one step behind the Jews, and many of them full of fear of what might happen to them, next. This is a great play.",Sophie's Choice
155,rosanna_206,Let's get this into the Top 250! An Emotional Whirlwind of a Movie with One of the Best Performances of All Time.,10,10 November 2009,"In my view this is a highly underrated film on IMDb and deserves a place in the top 250. The 3 main characters of the film give outstanding performances with masses of depth. Within the first 5 minutes of Meryl's performance you can see why she one an Oscar, even having seen most of her films- she had me pretty convinced she was European. Kline's eccentricity and passion works well with Streep's character and the two complement each other throughout. I can only say I've seen Peter MacNicol in 'Bean' before which was released many years later though he tames the fiery nature of the other two by his gentle, Southern approach. For the first hour or so, the film is quite simply fun and you really wish you were one of the three, but at the back of my mind I was trying to work out what Sophie's choice was. The film unravels and pieces together adhesively to where I get to a point where perhaps I don't want to be part of the trio. Unlike Schindler's List, where there is sadness throughout; Sophie's Choice touches upon the Holocaust but with such impact that will stick with me for life. As a story progresses it pieces together so well with a well-deserved, superb finale. It certainly touches upon all sorts of relationships, and cultures that we can all relate to and even as quite a critical person (when it comes to films), I consider this to be a must-see for everybody with possibly one of the best performances I have ever seen!",Sophie's Choice
156,leequick,One of the best: don't hesitate to give it your attention,9,20 May 2003,"Just saw Sophie's Choice again after at least 10 years...it's as heart-wrenchingly near-perfect as it was in 1983.  Forget Meryl's subsequent parade of accents and Kevin's comic turns: this is among the best acting in films, period.  And I've come to have new respect for Peter's thankless role as Stingo; he did a first-class job (in a pivotal,crucial part, by the way: if you don't realize this, you need to take a class in creative writing 101).  Have tissues ready and be ready to call a friend afterward.",Sophie's Choice
157,augustoGF,I can't think of a more impressionable film. Outstanding!,10,5 February 2007,"While I've always thought of Meryl Streep as a great actress, she surpasses my praise in this film. To see her speak her lines, to hear the delicate phrasing of not only her Polish, but her German with a Polish accent, then later, her English with a Polish accent, an altogether brutally difficult accomplishment, leaves me breathless. Beyond that skill, there's her transference to the character, Sophie, and to the main test as an actress, the absorption of the unspeakable atmosphere of a place -- the camp at Auschwitz -- of wholesale pain, indescribable humiliation, and the final acceptance of death of her child to save another. I'm sure the author of the book wept too in seeing his creation come to life as Meryl Streep.",Sophie's Choice
158,twohugedimples,Totally Awesome Flick,10,15 December 2003,"Is there no end to the talent of Meryl Streep?  She speaks many languages, awesome actress, and can sing.  Raised in a Jewish home, I can totally appreciate her character and what a story to tell.  The scene about her children and what she had to endure in the camp, was heartwrenching. There is a great book titled, Children of the SS and, every time I see the movie, I think of this book.  To live with the legacy that your dad was responsible for the death of innocent lives?  This was an intense movie, like Shindler's List, and long.  You have to be in the appropriate mood for the flick.  I believe Stingo represented a person overly simple....never experienced much in life and brought up in a sheltered environment.",Sophie's Choice
159,dakridge,Best Performance Ever,10,10 February 2005,"Meryl Streep's performance as Sophie is simply the finest performance ever captured on film. Period. The subtlety and depth with which she reveals Sophie's wounds are simply spellbinding. She is at once radiantly beautiful, yet deeply wounded. She is charming, yet vulnerable. She is someone you want to love, yet someone whose pain keeps you at a distance.This film takes the viewer on an intense emotional journey. Anyone, but especially anyone who is a parent, would have to be an emotional rock to not be absolutely haunted by this story. As much as I have studied and pondered the Holocaust, this film has connected me to those events more emotionally than I have ever been before.This film, and Ms. Streep's performance, are a gift to humanity.",Sophie's Choice
160,st-theresa,One of the Greatest Films - EVER,10,19 June 2005,"In the 20-something years since I first saw this film, nothing has compared. That first night I sat crying alone in the dark for Sophie, I decided I had two new favorite actors: Meryl Streep and Kevin Kline. Meryl has never once left that #1 position.What can be said about this film has already been said so eloquently by others. It IS a standard, it IS the absolute best performance by any actor (Meryl Streep) and it WILL break your heart into a million pieces.I'm not sure enough people give credit to the real creator of this character - William Styron, whose novel spawned the screenplay which gave birth to this monumental film experience.And honestly, people who are depressed or in despair should really not see this alone. Uplifting it is not.",Sophie's Choice
161,mukuldi,Almost a melodrama,6,11 December 2019,"It narrowly escaped from ending up as a sob story. The acting by all the three protagonists is superb, but the story telling is a tad drag.

162,dcgayinc,Sophie's Choice~Classic,10,29 December 2005,"Rarely would I give a film a rating of 10 as that is perfection. Sophie's Choice is and always will be a classic film, a film that will be watched decades from now by other generations. Meryl Streep is simply one of the greatest actresses of our time and has truly made her mark. Sophie's Choice is not another Holocaust film. In fact most of the movie doesn't refer to the holocaust but of Sophie, the character so brilliantly created by William Styron in his novel 'Sophie's Choice' and beautifully adapted into a screen play. We see Sophie through the eyes of Stingo, the young writer from the south who becomes infatuated with Sophie. Little by little Sophie's story is revealed. The title 'Sophie's Choice' refers to a particular choice made in the film by Sophie but in my eyes there are many choices that Sophie makes through out this film. Meryl Streep completely transformed herself into this character which she won the Acadamy Award for Best Actress and rightfully so. I don't think anybody else could have created Sophie as Streep did. Sophie lives for Nathan, the man she claims saved her life 6 months after coming to America. Sophie and Nathan's relationship is a roller coaster of highs and extreme lows. Stingo, their best friend is constantly on the outside looking in at the complex characters of Sophie and Nathan. This is a beautiful film as Sophie is a beautiful character you can't help but love and feel her pain.",Sophie's Choice
163,katresepp,"amazing acting, amazing story, amazing book..the movie should have been better.",7,10 May 2008,"I have to say that I have difficulties explaining what I felt having watched the movie. I mean, if Meryl Streep (and also Kevin Kline) hadn't played in the movie, it would have been almost not worthy looking. In saying that I don't want to say that I hate the story. The story itself is so beyond words that I can't even begin to explain but.. I read the book first and then decided to watch the movie. And this simple thing ruined it for me. So, when you've got a choice, please read the book before you watch the movie because in my thought, the movie pales in comparison to the book. I mean, there are so many other things in that story that are not brought out in the movie.Having said that, I would recommend watching the movie after you have finished the book, because the actors sure do their job there. 12 points out of 10 should definitely go to Meryl Streep in this movie.",Sophie's Choice
