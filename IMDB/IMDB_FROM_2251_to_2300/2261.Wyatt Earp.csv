0,bkoganbing,"Earp, The Whole Story",9,15 January 2010,"This particular version of the Wyatt Earp story may be the definitive Wyatt Earp tale. Not that it's the best Wyatt Earp movie although an argument certainly could be made in its favor. It's because this film encompasses more of his life than any other film so far as I've seen.I don't think any historical character even those out of the Bible have ever gotten better and more varied treatment with name stars playing the character. Most Earp films do center around the shootout at the OK Corral in Tombstone. There are some others like Wichita where Joel McCrea plays Wyatt Earp and the action centers around his first job as a marshal in Wichita. There are others like Hour Of The Gun where James Garner plays Earp and the action centers with the aftermath of the events at the OK Corral. A lot of that film is incorporated here. Garner played Earp again in Sunset which takes a look at Earp in the Roaring Twenties as a senior citizen in Hollywood. Wyatt was one tough dude in that one.But Wyatt Earp as produced and starring Kevin Costner takes a long view of Earp from his childhood with an abolitionist family in Illinois with Gene Hackman as his father. The action goes to a coda where we see Costner and Joanna Going as his common-law wife as a middle-aged couple at the turn of the last century. Costner plays Earp as an upright man, but one who will not hesitate to back up his play with whatever is at hand. In one of his first encounters with a bad man, he nails him with a thrown wooden billiard ball. It's almost like they were using the same acting coach, but Dennis Quaid in this film and Val Kilmer in Tombstone which came out roughly the same time turn in virtually identical performances as the murderous and tubercular Doc Holiday. You could transplant each other in the different film and not notice the difference. Here Quaid has around him Isabella Rosellini as Holiday's slattern mistress Big Nose Kate. The standard for that role was created in John Sturges's Gunfight At The OK Corral with Jo Van Fleet being abused and nursing Kirk Douglas as Holiday.One performance in this film that set a standard in terms of how close to reality the character was is that of Jeff Fahey as Ike Clanton. By all accounts this one got it right, Clanton was a cowardly bully who usually let others do his fighting for him. He ran out on his pals at the OK Corral including brother Billy Clanton. And Ike preferred not to do his killing face to face. Fahey really hit the mark in a small but well written role.Something tells me we've not exhausted Wyatt Earp as a film subject. Within the next decade and a half, I predict one if not more films will be made to once again interpret the character and events of the life and legend of Wyatt Earp.",Wyatt Earp
1,SnoopyStyle,"Long, rambling, and way too long",6,12 July 2014,"Nicholas Earp (Gene Hackman) is the patriarch of the family. To him, only blood matters and everybody else is just a stranger. The family including Wyatt Earp (Kevin Costner) goes out west after the end of the civil war. Years later, he goes back to Missouri and marries Urilla Sutherland (Annabeth Gish). When she dies, he is depressed and aimlessly roams the country. Eventually it culminates into the legendary gunfight at the OK Corral with Doc Holliday (Dennis Quaid).Kevin Costner is fine as a younger Wyatt still searching for a direction. He's not so great as the drunken mess. Later he's OK as the lawman. He has the righteousness but not necessarily the gravitas. It's asking a lot to play this wide range for anybody.The biggest problem is the general long winding life story. This is long, epic, and very long. It's like a biopic from a historian. It is too rambling and unfocused. Director Lawrence Kasdan does a good job filming the movie but this long biopic will always have problems. It's too rambling to create much tension or pick up any pacing. It's just overly ambitious.",Wyatt Earp
2,Hitchcoc,Some Historical Accuracies...But Not Many,6,8 March 2017,"I remember having to be somewhere. I had rented this movie back in the day, and I had to return it to the video store. So I watched it while my family was away. It went on and on and on. I can't complain about the acting or the production value. But it covered such a sprawling period of time and so many issues in the man's life, it was too big. Historically, Wyatt Earp was one of the most complex characters ever. He was more a politician than Sheriff, always trying to get re-elected and always having to overcome his past and come shady characters. His marriage was a disaster. His wife was needy and mean spirited and because Wyatt was an honorable man, he remained true to her. The big gunfight was so fictionalized that we don't really ever get to see it accurately portrayed except in documentaries. This isn't an awful movie. They just bit off too much for the time they had. And they had a lot of time.",Wyatt Earp
3,Prismark10,Wyatt Earp,3,5 May 2016,"The movie Tombstone was released a few months earlier than Wyatt Earp in the cinema. It was shorter and more action packed. It was also a better film.Wyatt Earp clocking in at over three hours is too long. It marked the beginning of Costner's decline at the box office. The audience frankly had enough of his very long epics and moody characters.Wyatt Earp wants to be a thoughtful ambitious biopic. It emerges as dull, bloated, uneven and about as truthful as many other pictures of this famous lawman. There is an overbearing score by James Newton Howard.Kevin Costner looks uneasy playing the younger Wyatt as an overgrown boy scout getting daily lectures on the importance of family by dad, Gene Hackman.After the sudden death of his first wife, what gradually emerges is a cold hard man who enforces the law his way, that way being by the barrel of the gun with his brothers as fellow enforcers.Director Lawrence Kasdan is shackled by Costner wanting to be the star of the show. The actors playing the brothers Earp do not get much of a look in as they are in the shadows of Costner, their wives come across more forcefully as they stand up to Wyatt for putting their husbands in danger. Rightly so, they all get shot and a few of them die.Even Dennis Quaid who lost weight to play Doc Holliday is underused and to me was largely a cameo. I can see why Val Kilmer overshadowed him in the rival Tombstone.The film is simply not compelling enough.",Wyatt Earp
4,classicsoncall,"""Nothing counts as much as blood. The rest are just strangers"".",8,13 August 2010,"I'll get on a kick every now and then, and currently it's Wyatt Earp and the Gunfight at the OK Corral. Having just watched ""Tombstone"" and ""Wyatt Earp"" about a week apart, the comparisons between the two films are inevitable. Both pictures do a fairly credible job of putting the gunfight in context with the relationship of the Earp's and the Cowboys. So if you don't mind the additional hour tagged on by the inclusion of Wyatt's back story, the latter film might be your cup of tea. Now I don't mind a three hour plus film if it's going to hold my interest all the way through. But let's face it, with a finale like the OK Corral, the sooner you get to the action the better.In approach, the Kasdan directed version here is what I'd consider the sanitized version of the Earps once they arrived in Tombstone. In most respects, the Earps are the good guys, and the Cowboys are the bad guys. For my money, the ""Tombstone"" take on the Earp reputation was closer to historical fact, that is, they were opportunists who ran the city about as close to a protection racket as you could get. They were involved in gambling and prostitution in addition to their mining interests, and Wyatt's ambition to replace Johnny Behan as Sheriff of Cochise County was also based largely on monetary consideration.Moving the comparison of the two pictures to the principal players, there again it appears that ""Tombstone"" was better cast. I'll take Kurt Russell over Costner's underplayed characterization of the famed lawman. Dennis Quaid acquitted himself real well as Doc Holliday, but you can't beat Val Kilmer's barroom showdown with Johnny Ringo and all the flamboyance that went with it. It seemed like Michael Madsen was never properly introduced as big brother Virgil, and let's face it, he's no Sam Elliott. Maybe if the Coen's or Tarantino were directing he would have stood out more, but I just didn't get a sense of Virgil's presence here. And it was Virgil who was Tombstone's City Marshal at the time. Bill Paxton or Linden Ashby as Morgan Earp - that might be the only toss up. I could probably go right down the line with the supporting players as well, and the ""Tombstone"" faction takes it going away handily.If I'm going to give the film some kudos, it's going to be with the actual gunfight. The real deal lasted only about thirty seconds with thirty one shots fired between the two factions. Now it's difficult to keep track of movie bullets flying, but in that regard, ""Tombstone"" overreached with about fifty gunshots that I was able to keep up with. With the benefit of replay, I managed to count off twenty nine shots pretty consistently each time I viewed that scene here. Of course those two shots I missed could just as easily have been there, it was just too difficult for my human ear to detect.So I guess what it comes down to is 'take your pick'. I prefer ""Tombstone"" but ""Wyatt Earp"" is still a good modern day Western that should satisfy anyone's passing interest for the Cowboy era and it's principal legend. Better yet, watch them both and then decide for yourself.",Wyatt Earp
5,jboothmillard,Wyatt Earp,7,12 December 2005,"Months after the film Tombstone was released came this film, but it instead shows the full life journey of one of history's greatest lawmen, from Razzie nominated director Lawrence Kasdan (The Big Chill). It shows Wyatt Earp (Razzie winning Kevin Costner, also producing) growing up on the corn farm with his father Nicholas (Gene Hackman) and brothers Virgil (Michael Madsen), James (David Andrews) and Morgan (Linden Ashby). Then grown up, he marries sweetheart Urilla Sutherland (Annabeth Gish), who soon after died from typhus, while pregnant, and Wyatt burned their house and all possessions inside, turning to a life of crime to survive, forcing him to run away from Missouri to Dodge City. It is there he first makes a living skinning wilder beasts with brothers Ed (Bill Pullman) and Bat (Tom Sizemore) Masterson, then he builds a reputation as a good lawman, grows his moustache, meets partner Doc Holliday (a near show-stealing Dennis Quaid) who is slowly dying of tuberculosis, and makes sure all townspeople do not have any guns. I kind of lost my understanding of what was going on in the last hour or so, but it was still worth seeing the events in Tombstone and O.K. Corral. Also starring Catherine O'Hara as Allie Earp, Isabella Rossellini as Big Nose Kate, Téa Leoni as Sally, Navy NCIS's Mark Harmon as Johnny Behan and The Passion of the Christ's James Caviezel as Warren Earp. The performances are all good, the story has compelling moments, and all scenes seem beautifully filmed, a pretty good epic western drama. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Cinematography, and for some reason, it won the Razzie for Worst Remake or Sequel, and it was nominated for Worst Picture and Worst Screen Couple for Costner and any of his three (film) wives. Very good!",Wyatt Earp
6,ccthemovieman-1,I'll Take This Version Over The Rest,9,25 October 2005,"This is one of the best, and underrated, westerns ever made. It was a very intense, interesting character study of a famous lawman, showing flaws and all. In fact, this is the only version, I believe, that really shows the sadistic side of Wyatt Earp, and what made him a bitter man. To be fair, it also shows his good traits. It also has a terrific, deep cast and features a good mix of drama, romance and action. Even the music grows on you after several viewings. There is no humor in here: this is a serious story. Unlike the more popular ""Tombstone,"" this Earp story has a lot less profanity and almost no usage of the Lord's name in vain....but there is rough language and some crude sexual remarks, so don't watch it with the kiddies.At rate, the movie is a lot better than the critics would have you believe. (All nationally-known critics but one panned this, as far as I know.)Kevin Costner performed one of his better acting jobs. It was nice to see Michael Madsen and Tom Sizemore as good guys. That's not seen in too many films! They were low-key characters, too. Dennis Quaid did a nice job as the fascinating ""Doc Holliday."" It's generally conceded that Val Kilmer's ""Doc"" in ""Tombstone"" was the best-ever, but Quaid version is just fine, thank you, and gets better and better with each viewing. This is a long movie, but it's never dull and it never overdoes the action, either. The cast is deep so you see a lot of familiar actors. As mentioned, this film is extremely underrated. I know most people prefer ""Tombstone"" but I'll take this version of the Earp saga any time!",Wyatt Earp
7,rmax304823,It's a Long Trial That Has No Turning.,6,13 August 2013,"Man, at 122 minutes, this is a longie. Probably three separate movies could have been made from this material. (1) Young Wyatt finally wins the girl he loves back home in Missouri and she promptly get pregnant and dies in his arms. Wyatt turns into a drunk before he finds himself. That one goes straight to Lifetime Movie Network. (2) After a few years of being a roustabout, Wyatt and his brother become deputy marshals, first in Dodge City, then in Tombstone. The Clanton brothers and a few other miscreants get nasty and it all leads to the famous shootout at the O.K. Corral. (3) Not all of the villains are dead and the surviving ones vow revenge. Another climactic shoot out at a train station in Tucson. Yes, there are several movies buried in this script, and actually at least four have already been made: ""Tombstone,"" ""My Darling Clementine,"" ""Shootout at the O.K. Corral"", and ""Hour of the Gun."" Almost time for the story to be told from the Clanton's perspective.In watching these highly ritualized Westerns it's important to understand why the values we see being embraced were, in fact, being embraced. Pardon me, while I adjust this lectern. And, please, let's not throw any more spitballs.The United States was essentially founded on two independent cultures, the theocracies of the North, the Puritans or Roundhead as they were sometimes called, and the South was settled by Cavaliers, who were men of stern honor. The English philosopher, Thomas Hobbes, had argued that the natural state of man was utter savagery, a ""war of all against all,"" unless some kind of authority was introduced. In the settled communities of the North, that authority was the law and obeisance to God. In the South, authority rested with the individual, built on personal dignity, and a distaste for central authority. As the country spread westward, so did these different conceptions of responsibility. Southerners were existentialists of a sort. A man was what he made of himself. Or, to put it in the parlance of the Western film, ""A man's gotta do what a man's gotta do,"" or, ""When you call me that, smile."" The various shoot outs we see in this movie are only modernized forms of Medieval jousts or duels with sword or pistol. Wyatt Earp violates ""the law"" he's supposed to uphold numerous times and is charged with murder. He and his friends get off because the law is weak and the judge sees ""no criminal offense"" in the murder. A Texas judge, a few years ago, was informed of a homicide and asked: ""Did he NEED killin'?"" And that, boys and girls, is why the North is blue and the South is red. And let's cut out those spitballs, please.Lots of well-known names in this cast list. It often helps to understand what kind of Western you're getting into if you look at the heroes and villains. The heroes no longer wear white hats and the villains black. We're not THAT simple minded anymore. But usually, as here, the villains are creepy, oily, ugly, and/or filthy.Costner does okay by the role of Wyatt, and Dennis Quaid almost always turns in a good performance. As a tubercular, Quaid has been decked out by wardrobe in suits that are wrinkled and too large for him, as if he's wasting away before our eyes. And towards the end, his face has grown pale and his eyes are rimmed with a touch of red. Not too much. Just enough. Nice job.Some of the recognizable names aren't on screen much. Mark Harmon, as a sheriff, barely shows up. Isabella Rossellini, my supporting player in ""Blue Velvet,"" has only one scene. Jim Caviezel is hardly seen. But then a lot of the characters are so ragged and bundled up and covered with soil that they're hard to identify. Joanna Going has an important role and doesn't bring it home effectively.It's a long and complex story and though it does raise some moral questions, there's never any doubt about whose side we're on. In a world of Cavaliers, you must wield a sabre with skill and determination. And in the end, what has Wyatt Earp learned? Nothing. In that respect, it's very different from Clint Eastwood's ""Unforgiven.""",Wyatt Earp
8,ma-cortes,A very serious and disgustingly overlong biography about the mythic gunslinger and sheriff,6,8 January 2020,"Exciting revisionist epic Western about the mythic figure that suffers from bad timing and extremely overlong due to prolonged introduction to his early life , but with plenty of tension , emotion , romance , thrills , gunplay and high body-count . It is a vigorous recounting of a familiar tale , dealing with legendary lawman moves to Tombstone , Arizona , aiming to begin a new life along with his brothers , Virgil , James , Morgan ,and their wives . This trigger-taut Western drama deals with the tarnished badge lawman Wyatt Earp (Kevin Costner) and a badman gunslinger and philosopher Southern gent who usually coughs , called Doc Holliday , (Dennis Quaid who excels , giving comsumptive conviction to character) , the strangest friendship this side of heaven and hell . They fought shoulder to shoulder in the wildest stand-up gunfight in the history of the West . Meanwhile , Wyatt falls in love for an actress , Josie (Joanna Going) , though lacks the indispensable romantic spark . As the fabled showdown is seen about two-thirds of the way through this film . They are the strangest alliance between the West's most famous sheriff , Wyatt Earp , trying to overcome outlaws and the deadliest gambling killer , tubercular Doc Holliday . At the beginning it deals with his relationship to a strict father (Gene Hackman who is terrific , as usual) , as Wyatt grows in a grain ranch and marries the girl (Annabeth Gish) he always fancied , subsequently he takes various employments as a buffalo hunter , a croupier , as he ends up -as do most of his brothers- , as a lawman . It's incomparably performed by the greatest team who ever went into action , Kevin Costner portrays the large-than-life lawman , living by the old rules , driven by revenge , dueling to the death and Dennis Quaid who is most impressive as a gunslinger , the hellfire gambler , his only friends were his guns and his only refuge was a woman's heart , Big Nose Kate (Isabella Rossellini) . Wyatt and his brothers try to settle down to prospecting in Tombstone ; later on , there takes place the famous gunfight at OK Corral that is more of a skirmish . Two towering Box office actors in a huge exciting production . The film correctly builds up its suspense , even though movie is some 50 minutes too long , until a tense battle in streets of Tombstone , it is the highlight to the story and the start of a small war between the revenger Earp and the baddies : The nasty Cowboys , led by Curly Bill , Johnny Ringo , Ike Clanton , Billy Clanton , Frank McLaury .This is an overwhelming Western , though too self-conscious , suffering from 90s Western revisionism . It was partially panned , but being , nowadays , well considered , may be seen by some as unoriginal and cliched but is really a very fashionable outing in Earp saga and a throughly agreeable Western , though really inferior to ¨Tombstone¨ by George Pan Cosmatos . Kevin Costner sounds and looks the part more than any other Earp , though he is hardly ever as a 20 and some lad but fares better as he ages . While Dennis Quaid delivers an awesome acting , stealing clearly the show , a character designed for scenary chewing , giving a breathtaking portrayal of the doomed dentist . Thirty pounds lighter and likely delusional Quaid is actually unrecognizable as Doc . Although overlong , but blessed with a high-energy level , thanks to noisy action , spectacular horse riding and rousing shooting . Costner spends a lot of time looking troubled by the violence while kills relentlessly. There's also essential support from the very effective David Andrews as James Earp , Linden Ashby as Morgan Earp and Michael Madsen as Virgil . As the picture benefits itself from despictable villians and a mutual merciless vengeance that the Earps and the Clanton attempt to exact . The film focuses Tombstone , 1881 , with stimulating scenes about OK Corral gunfight between Morgan , Virgil , Wyatt Earp , Doc against the nefarious Ike Billy Clanton , Johnny Ringo, and Tom McLowery . This main character is a historical figure , in this case the sheriff Wyatt Earp who participated the most famous duel occurred in the western town of Tombstone in 1881 that has been brought to the big screen many times as in the classic ""My Darling Clementine"" in 1946 directed by John Ford with Henry Fonda and Victor Mature , in this ""Gunfight at O.K. Corral"" (1957) with Burt Lancaster , Kirk Douglas directed by specialist John Sturges who would resume the same story in ""The Hour of the Gun"" (1967) ; the demystifying ""Doc"" (Frank Perry, 1971) with Harris Yulin and Stacy Keach . And , finally , the more modern, this one shot at the same time : ""Tombstone: The Legend of Wyatt Earp"" by George P. Cosmatos, 1993 with Kurt Russell , Val Kilmer , Sam Elliott , Bill Paxton , Dana Delaney , Robert Burke , Michael Biehn , Thomas Haden Church , Dana Wheeler , Powers Boothe.This is a story enormous in scope , unusual in concept with a mile-a-minute action on a climatic and thrill-a-minute gunfight. Packs a magnificent and marvelous cinematography with a nice sense of period , and brilliant Technicolor in overblown chromatic by Owen Roitzman , being filmed on location in Santa Fe , New Mexico . As well as adequate costuming and lavish production design . This saga of Earp family and the band of law-abiding large moustaches contains a spectacular and lyric musical score by James Newton Howard who composes a rousing soundtrack . All of them help make this one an enjoyable action western film . The motion picture was professionally directed by Lawrence Kasdan , though there's much unnecessary fiddling around in Tombstone and Earp's first years . So that the film seems to be the ending , you realize there's still fifty minutes to go on and then drifts on .",Wyatt Earp
9,michaelRokeefe,Long let his legend be told. Worthwhile western epic.,6,5 March 2001,"Director Lawrence Kasdan gives us three hours of wild west adventure, rugged romance and plenty of gunfire. An almost excellent script from Kasden and Dan Gordon that is put to the test by a talented ensemble cast. The life and legend of Earp and his family proves very interesting, although taking a back seat to the film TOMBSTONE.Kevin Coster does a good job as the famed lawman, but seems a little less powerful compared to the image of Earp in our minds. Dennis Quaid gives us a different slant on Doc Holiday. One of his better roles. Other fine performances are logged in by Mark Harmon, Catherine O'Hara, Gene Hackman, Bill Pullman, Michael Madsen, Tom Sizemore, Tea Leoni, Martin Kove and Joanna Going.Maybe a half hour too long, but this movie is more than your average western. Relax and enjoy a very good version of the life of Wyatt Earp.",Wyatt Earp
10,sunwarrior13,A Western That Is Rarely Made,9,24 October 2012,"Wyatt Earp is a semi-biographical Western film that is written by Dan Gordon and Lawrence Kasdan. Directed by Lawrence Kasdan, this epic version of the legendary western sheriff-gunslinger's life story stars Kevin Costner in the title role as Wyatt Earp, who lived from 1848 to 1929.It also includes an ensemble cast that includes Dennis Quaid, Gene Hackman, Isabella Rossellini, Mark Harmon, Michael Madsen, Joanna Going, Tom Sizemore, Bill Pullman, JoBeth Williams, Linden Ashby, and Mare Winningham.Growing up on a farm in Iowa, Earp tries to run away to join the Union Army in the Civil War, but he is turned away because of his youth. Instead, he studies law and marries Urilla Sutherland. But Urilla dies of typhoid fever before they can have children. Earp grows despondent and descends into drinking and petty thievery, but his father Nicholas finds him, sobers him up, and sets him straight. Earp becomes a buffalo hunter and a close companion of Bat Masterson and his brother Ed. With his brothers, Virgil and Morgan, Earp sets out to clean up the violence- plagued towns of the old West by using his own guns to settle scores. Earp takes up with Mattie Blaylock, a drug addict and prostitute, then discards her for actress Josie Marcus. In Tombstone, Arizona, the Earp brothers and their comrade Doc Holliday, who is plagued by tuberculosis and a compulsion for gambling, meet their match in a ruthless gang led by Ike Clanton.This massive, in-depth study of the dark Western icon comes off with mixed results. Trying to capture the whole life, of the lawman-criminal- brother-fortune hunter, director Lawrence Kasdan gains points for sheer scale, giving us a rich epic painted in dark colors with gritty settings. But the visual poetry and extensive foreshadowing ruin the dramatic drive. Some scenes have as much impact as stalker movies; you're just waiting for someone to get knocked off. As Earp, Kevin Costner is not afraid to look rumpled and play colorlessly, but it saps the energy of this 3-hour-plus film. Best is the first half, with Costner, as hip as he was in his Silverado days, going through a series of ups and downs until he accidentally finds his profession. Great set design utilizes dozens of similar settings that always look distinctive. Recommended to fans of the star and the genre, but the story never justifies its length.But nevertheless,it is beautifully shot and impressively directed, it's an ambitious Western in the classic mold, the kind of film that rarely gets made anymore.",Wyatt Earp
11,LeonLouisRicci,Meandering Movie with Multiple Endings,6,15 March 2016,"Kevin Costner can Pass as a Movie Star, once in awhile, but Simply does not have the Depth as an Actor to Pull Off this Heavy Study of the Western Icon. Especially when the Script takes Over Three Hours to put On Screen, the Length and Microscopic Details that Focus on the Life of Wyatt Earp ends up Revealing itself as another Kevin Costner Vanity Project.He is a Much Better Fit in ""Open Range"" (2003) having Grown Out of His Self Aggrandizement and His Film Projects in the Later Years show a Humble Restraint. Lessons Learned.Mediocre and Inconsistent Director Lawrence Kasdan must take Equal Blame for this Elongated, Episodic Epic. It's Not a Bad Film, but Only Slightly Above Average. Because the Better Parts (the Cinematography, and some good B Actors) are Intruded Upon by way too Many side Stories and a Bloated, Wordy Script that Keeps making the same Points, Over and Over.Overall, it's an Obese Film that seems to Never get any Momentum and even when it Manages some Motion, it is Reined In and Slowed Down by rather Boring and Unwelcome Scenes. The Movie Ends a Number of Times and the Train Sequence in one of the Endings is so Mishandled and Unremarkable as to be Anti-Climactic and Nearly Incomprehensible.Worth a Watch for Die-Hard Western Fans, but Others are Not Likely to be Impressed and may have Trouble making it to One of the Endings.",Wyatt Earp
12,grantss,"Goodish, but not great, and much potential wasted",6,8 March 2015,"Goodish, but not great. Excessively long, at over three hours. Lacks focus, dwelling too much on minor details and irrelevant sub- plots. It could easily have been cut down to two hours, and been tighter, punchier and just as character-centric.I am not a fan of Kevin Costner, and this movie didn't help that impression. He doesn't do Wyatt Earp much justice - trying to act the hero by being cool and calm, but just coming across as solemn, aloof and boring.This said, the cinematography and scenery are great. Dennis Quaid's portrayal of Doc Holliday is something to behold.The remainder of the cast is pretty amazing for the names involved, some of which weren't stars yet and/or had very minor roles - Gene Hackman, Mark Harmon, Bill Pullman, Michael Madsen, Jeff Fahey, Isabella Rossellini, Tom Sizemore, Mare Winningham, Tea Leoni.So much potential wasted.",Wyatt Earp
13,view_and_review,Tombstone Did It Better,6,12 August 2020,"I know that ""Wyatt Earp"" is a comprehensive movie about Wyatt Earp while ""Tombstone"" was more focused on the occurrences at Tombstone and, more famously, the O.K. Corral--still, I prefer ""Tombstone.""""Wyatt Earp"" was drama between Earp and his in-laws, Earp and his ""wife"", Earp and himself, and, of course, Earp and Ike's gang. I knew that ""Wyatt Earp"" would invariably have some elements that I didn't care for. It was over three hours long so it was inevitable. Once I got those elements, one being an unholy love triangle, I was tangibly perturbed.Was Costner better than Russell? Was Quaid a better Doc Holliday than Kilmer? Was Michael Madsen a better Virgil Earp than Sam Elliott? That's a no, no, and no. I'm partial to ""Tombstone"" to begin with and I also happen to believe that the three actors of the former did better than the three actors of the latter. Kevin Costner, for all the quality movies he's been in, is not an ideal actor in my humble opinion. But Keven didn't stand out alone as a rather empty character. There were quite a few rote performances to the degree that I believe the director had to be instructing them to be as mechanically precise as possible.It's clear that the movie ""Wyatt Earp"" wanted to expound on Earp's frailties and fallibility. That's to be commended, I suppose, as no person is without faults. Wyatt Earp's story wasn't that bad. He certainly lived a more eventful life than most, but at three hours and eleven minutes I don't care how eventful your life was--it needs to be a mini-series.",Wyatt Earp
14,HotToastyRag,Boring and hard to root for,3,21 July 2017,"I always find it fun when a boring movie's backstory is juicy; it's like a consolation prize! So here's the deal with Wyatt Earp: Kevin Costner was going to star in Tombstone, but he split off from the project and co-produced Wyatt Earp with Lawrence Kasdan. He'd wanted the movie to be all about Wyatt, so hopefully he was happy with his own version. The ironic revenge of Tombstone? It was released six months earlier and made more money at the box office.Now, to the movie. It's over three hours, which is an improvement over the 6-hour miniseries it was originally intended to be! But it's still really long, and not in a good way. Some movies can get away with a slow pace, and this just isn't one of them. The cure for such terrible boredom would have been a title character so wonderful and easy to root for that the audience doesn't mind the slowness. In this version, Wyatt just isn't likable. He's violent, vengeful, selfish, loses his temper constantly, and is a womanizer who doesn't have any respect for women. I don't usually have an issue with that, especially if it's during a time period when respect for women is hard to find anyway, but the ""charm"" Wyatt uses during his romantic interactions is more offensive than appealing. I tried, but it was pretty impossible to root for Kevin Costner in this movie, and if you're not rooting for the hero, you've got a very long three hours in store for you.My favorite version of this story is 1957's Gunfight at the O.K. Corral. But if you like modern westerns and Kevin Costner, watch Open Range. It's similar and much, much better.",Wyatt Earp
15,Wuchakk,"""Wyatt Earp"" or ""Tombstone""? How 'bout BOTH",8,12 March 2014,"Lawrence Kasdan's ""Wyatt Earp"" got a raw deal in 1994 when it was released; the movie ""Tombstone"" -- essentially the same story -- came out six months earlier and stole its thunder. The difference in these two films can be observed in their names: ""Tombstone"" focuses on Earp's conflict with the 'Cowboys' gang in the Arizona town, whereas ""Wyatt Earp"" is an epic Western detailing Earp's life from youth to old age, although the Tombstone events are certainly the center piece. ""Wyatt Earp"" runs 3 hours 11 minutes and ""Tombstone"" is an hour shorter. Both are top-of-the-line modern Westerns and whether you'll like one or the other depends on what you're in the mood for. If you want kinetic mythmaking ""Tombstone fills the bill, but if you want realistic storytelling with the details and mundaneness thereof then ""Wyatt Earp"" is the way to go. Regardless, both are vastly superior to the dull 1957 version with Burt Lancaster and Kirk Douglas, ""Gunfight at the O.K. Corral."" I originally saw ""Tombstone"" sometime in the 90s, but by the time I got around to seeing ""Wyatt Earp"" I had forgotten the former film; as such, ""Tombstone"" wasn't able to 'steal the thunder' from my viewing of Costner's version. I was engrossed throughout. It may not be as great as his ""Dances with Wolves"" (1990), but it's not far off and, besides, few Westerns stand equal with that one.I recently saw both films back-to-back and it is fun comparing the two. Val Kilmer from ""Tombstone"" wins out over Dennis Quaid as Doc Holiday, but not by much and not because Quaid is bad but rather because Holiday's role is more prominent in ""Tombstone"" with better lines. Actually Kilmer is nothing less than fascinating in the role, although Quaid is more believable. Kurt Russell and Costner are about even as Earp, but ""Tombstone"" wins out overall in cast with Sam Elliott, Powers Boothe, Michael Biehn, Billy Zane and the shining Dana Delany as Josie, although Joanna Going in the same role in ""Wyatt"" shines just as much. But there are several exceptions; for instance, Isabella Rossellini in ""Wyatt"" edges out Joanna Pacula as Big Nose Kate, Doc's babe. As for the dramatic walk to the O.K. Corral and the gunfight itself I favor ""Wyatt Earp,"" but ""Tombstone"" has a better dramatic build-up to the confrontation. However, ""Tombstone"" loses too much steam after the gunfight with redundant shootouts between Wyatt & his men and the Cowboys; ""Wyatt Earp"" maintains better momentum in the final act where the train sequence is much more impressive than the quick rendition shown in ""Tombstone.""Unlike ""Tombstone,"" which was shot in Arizona, ""Wyatt"" was shot in New Mexico, with additional scenes shot in South Dakota, Port Angeles, WA, and Burbank Studios, CA.FINAL WORD: Don't listen to the moron critics who undeservedly bashed ""Wyatt Earp"" upon release in '94. They're wrong, pure and simple. ""Tombstone"" was evidently too fresh in their minds and ruined the story for them. ""Wyatt Earp"" easily stands with the all-time best Westerns. Just make sure you're in the mood for a 3-hour-plus epic before viewing. And, by all means, catch ""Tombstone"" too -- they're both great.GRADE: A-",Wyatt Earp
16,mm-39,Watchable,6,9 September 2002,"My dad hates this film and I watch it with little expectations and enjoyed it.  Not the best movie ever, but I like the grittiness of it.  The part where they show him in the bar, and how his life led to his moment with destiny. It is unfair to compare this to Tombstone, when they both came out, because Tombstone is a classic.  This film is worth a look. 6 or 7 out of 10.",Wyatt Earp
17,JamesHitchcock,One of the Better Modern Westerns.,7,8 December 2005,"The great critical and commercial success of ""Dances with Wolves"" and ""Unforgiven"" in the early nineties led many, myself included, to hope that a great revival of the cinematic Western might be on the way. Although those hopes have largely been disappointed, the genre is in better health now than it was in the eighties and there have been a number of good examples. ""Wyatt Earp"" is one of them.Earp has been the hero of several Westerns, and those that I have seen (I have not seen either John Sturges's ""Hour of the Gun"" or the more recent ""Tombstone"") have concentrated either on events in Tombstone (""My Darling Clementine"", ""Gunfight at the OK Corral"") or on those in Dodge City (""Dodge City"" itself, which offered a fictionalised version of the Earp story). ""Wyatt Earp"", however, is an attempt at a filmed biography which gives us its hero's entire life story, starting with his boyhood in Illinois. Most of the first hour or so is taken up with Earp's life before he became a lawman; the famous gunfight, about two-thirds of the way through the film's three hours, only takes up about a couple of minutes of the action.The advantage of showing us the hero's early life is that this allows us to understand many of the facets of his character. Perhaps the most important incident in the film is the tragically early death of his young first wife Urilla; Earp's grief at her death turns him from a quiet, studious young man with an ambition to become a lawyer into a lawless desperado. Facing a death-sentence in Arkansas for horse-stealing (evidently still a capital crime in America in the 1870s, long after it had ceased to be one in Britain), Earp is rescued by his father's intervention and flees to the West as a fugitive from justice. His later career as a lawman is interpreted as an effort to make amends for this youthful foray into lawlessness. Another aspect of his character brought out in these early scenes is the importance to him of family ties. He and his brothers Morgan and Virgil later make a formidable team, with stronger emotional ties to one another than to the women in their lives.In an earlier age, Earp would probably have been portrayed as a clean-cut hero, the brave man in the white hat cleaning up the wild frontier, but in the revisionist nineties such an approach seemed too simplistic and the film offers us something closer to a ""warts and all"" portrayal. Apart from the horse-stealing incident, Earp is sacked from his job as Sheriff of Dodge City because his methods of law enforcement seem excessively harsh even by Wild West standards, and much of the film is taken up with details of his loveless sexual relationship with the prostitute Mattie Blaylock. There is, however, a limit to the film's revisionism. As with many biopics, the film-makers have selected episodes from their subject's life in order to form a coherent narrative to illustrate a particular viewpoint. In this case the narrative seems to be that of a wild young man who matures into a legendary hero of the West, and any historical details which do not fit in are ignored. For example, the film does not explore the suggestion made by some historians that the Gunfight had less to do with law enforcement than with a feud between the Earp family and their Clanton rivals over control of Tombstone's businesses. On the other hand, the film is sometimes harder on Earp than the historical record might warrant. In reality, there is considerable doubt about whether he was actually guilty of horse-stealing; in the film his guilt is quite apparent.""Wyatt Earp""'s main weakness is its great length. It is clearly aiming to repeat the success of Kevin Costner's other epic Western of the nineties, ""Dances with Wolves"", but does not have that film's staying power, and at times can seem too slow-moving. Costner's acting is not quite as compelling as in the earlier film, but he is still very watchable, and this is one of his better films, much better than, say, ""The Bodyguard"" or the embarrassingly bad ""Waterworld"". There is a good cameo from Gene Hackman as Earp's father, but the best contribution is probably from Dennis Quaid as the tubercular Doc Holliday, spitting out defiance of the world in his Southern drawl in between his bouts of coughing.Despite its occasional longueurs, in its latter stages (which deal with the post-Gunfight spiral of revenge between the Earp and Clanton gangs, with Wyatt's happy second marriage to the beautiful Josie and with his final promotion to legendary status) the film achieves a similar epic grandeur to that of ""Dances with Wolves"", aided by those familiar features of the large-scale Western, sweeping photography of the scenery and a stirring musical score. One of the better modern Westerns. 7/10",Wyatt Earp
18,DKosty123,Best Western Drama In Years,8,12 August 2007,"This is the best western drama in many years. It is too long but that is a necessary evil when it goes through a retelling of a lot of western legends, not just a single story. It is a single story of the Earp family, but the Earps touched many other legendary Western characters in their lives that it goes much more in depth because of this. Kevin Costner proves again that he can carry a long dramatic film. He has plenty of good support along the way in this one. Dennis Quaid as Doc Holiday is an excellent choice & plays the role very well. There are plenty of others too, but I want to avoid making my review too long. You can watch the film itself.More characters are well drawn & given time to develop in this than most westerns. There are more women in this one with more screen time than in many. The costumes & scenery are well done too.Like any western legends, there are most certainly some facts in this one as well as some fiction. The main thing is that the stories are well presented & acted by an excellent cast. This makes it a very watchable film- especially if your as avid a western fan as some people are Tiger Woods fans. This film is almost as long as the coverage of a PGA tourney where Tiger Woods is leading. The story is much more exciting though as it keeps me awake better than the golf does.",Wyatt Earp
19,disdressed12,fascinating,7,20 April 2008,"this movie is quite a bit different than 1993's Tombstone.obviously it focuses on Wyatt Earp,more than anything.this movie paints quite a different picture of Earp than Tombstone does.it depicts him in a much different light.Kevin Costner's portrayal of Earp is much different than Kurt Russel's in Tombstone.i think i liked Russel's portrayal a bit more.Dennis Quaid portrays Doc Holliday,and his portrayal is much different than Val Kilmer's in Tombstone.i actually liked Val Kilmer's performance better,and i liked his character more.Quaid does a good job though.the supporting cast is also very good.another big difference between this movie and Tombstone,is that this movie is very deliberately paced,and more in depth.the story is much deeper.there is not that much action,and some may be turned of by the length of the movie at over 3hrs.but if you can view it as character study,you might enjoy it.one thing i really liked rising the musical score.i found it very rousing and poetic.for me,Wyatt Earp is a 7/10",Wyatt Earp
20,Robert_duder,The Essential Western Epic,8,29 January 2006,"Wyatt Earp if nothing else is the Western of all Westerns. It's epically enormous and tells a story of a man that could only be fiction and yet was a real person. There isn't anything that a lover of Westerns won't find in this film. It has absolutely everything. It is a very, very long film. It was originally meant to be a whopping six hours so thank goodness it was cut to only three. Without a doubt I think this is director Lawrence Kasdan's best work although he did work on another Kevin Costner vehicle that was very good, The Bodyguard.Costner plays the lead role of Wyatt Earp. Now one thing is for sure Kevin Costner is an acquired taste. No matter what he's a commanding presence on screen and his portrayal of tough as nails, take no prisoners Wyatt Earp is awesome!! Sure sometimes he is a little dry in his acting but he has a quiet intensity that makes his roles so watchable. He goes from loving husband to grieving, to drunk, to Marshall, to protector, to the executioner flawlessly and seamlessly. The supporting cast of this film is incredible and too numerous to mention everyone. They have such an incredible ensemble cast and everyone adds to it in different ways. Gene Hackman makes a cameo as Wyatt's father, Michael Madsen as his brother, Catherine O'Hara as his sister-in-law (Madsen's wife), Bill Pullman as Ed Masterson, Isabella Rossellini as Doc Holliday's woman, Tom Sizemore as Bat Masterson, Adam Baldwin, Téa Leoni, Jeff Fahey...and I could go on. The film is a virtual who's who of Hollywood A and B movie actors who come together like I've never seen on screen. It's just fun picking out who you recognize as most of them are done up to an almost unrecognizable state with era costumes and set. However the two performances most noted were Costner and the amazing Dennis Quaid who plays the ill fated Doc Holliday. I did feel that they didn't really establish the friendship as much as they could have between Earp and Holliday but nonetheless Quaid's performance was the best in the film and Oscar worthy. A cold blooded killer, dying of consumption and dedicated to his friend. He's barely recognizable, even his voice is different and he's the perfect choice.Wyatt Earp's most brilliant part is the entire setting including costumes, locations, and capturing the entire era of any era it displays. The dusty, dark, gritty world of the old west to the plains of Arizona to the Alaskan coast in the end. It's a visual masterpiece. The costumes are spot on and brilliant. I think Costner has a real love for the western and you can see his passion in this film. As producer he likely had a big hand in it's creation and it shows. I think Costner is a worthy Hollywood star and I've always liked him and this is one of the great films he has done. Any fans of Westerns MUST see Wyatt Earp because although made in the nineties it's the essential western epic and brilliantly done just a little long, that's all. Can't beat the content or performances and familiar faces. 8/10",Wyatt Earp
21,paul2001sw-1,Too reverent,6,1 February 2009,"Wyatt Earp, the sheriff involved in the fight at the O.K. Corral, is logically an inconsequential figure in American history; but his story has endured, perhaps because it's perceived as embodying the nature of the wild west, and the fine line between the law and the outlaw. Here he gets a solemn, lengthy biopic in which thee famous shoot-out is just one incident among many. I find the usually obligatory comedy character a major irritant in most westerns, but I almost wished there was one in this movie, which proceeded with a total absence of humour. What it does contain is a very conservative rendering of Earp's interesting life, it's colourful developments played down as the rather one dimensional tale of a brave and heroic man looking out for his family. Keven Costner is predictably at home playing this boring yet righteous hero; Dennis Quaid as gunslinger Doc Holliday has all the best lines. But in a film this long, they're too and far between, and the failure to develop the political and economic context of the story, in favour of a straightforward celebration of Earp's courage and integrity, leaves the film without an excuse for its length.",Wyatt Earp
22,g-bodyl,Vastly Underrated!,8,4 March 2013,"Frankly, I have no idea why nearly all critics bashed this film, Wyatt Earp. This is another romantic western that goes on to tell the story of a famed lawman in the Old West and it is an effective story. Yes, it's a little bit too long but the time flew by fast. Some movies require this kind of length to tell a proper story. What I liked about this movie is that it had a great cast, great camera work, and best of all characters you come to know and fall in love with.Lawrence Kasdan's western epic is a biography on the lawman, Wyatt Earp who is famous for being hard-nosed and abides to the law by the book. This story tells of how he grew up with advice from his father to his times as lawman with his brothers.Kevin Costner, in the late 80's through mid 90's, has made plenty of great movies. Unfortunately, this movie started his downfall. That makes me sad because he was great in this as the guy who took no nonsense. I liked how Tom Sizemore and Michael Madsen played good guys because quite often they don't. I wanted more screen time for Gene Hackman because his few scenes were really powerful. Dennis Quaid was also really good as Doc Holliday, better than I expected Quaid to do.Overall, this is a really good western, better than what people give it credit for. After the success of Dance with Wolves and Unforgiven, I would think these kind of westerns would gain popularity. I guess that is not the case just yet. Even though this film clocks in at 3 hours and 10 minutes, I liked nearly every second of it. I rate this film 8/10.",Wyatt Earp
23,vincentlynch-moonoi,Dull and boring and lasts forever,5,6 July 2013,"First off, Congress should pass a law that Kevin Costner will not be allowed to make any film lasting longer than 119 minutes. That will immediately cut down on the suffering of movie-goers. Of course, I'm joking...sort of.Costner was originally associated with the film ""Tombstone"", but didn't agree with the way the production was going. So, he set off on his own project. That was a mistake. Perhaps Costner's version was more accurate...I'm not sure. But I do know that accuracy doesn't always make the better film. ""Tombstone"" ranks as one of the truly great Westerns. ""Wyatt Earp"" simply doesn't rate...at all.The acting here is fine...but rather depressing. Where's the likable character? Ah, there's a flaw. We learn that Wyatt Earp was pretty unlikable. In fact, non one here was very likable.Kevin Costner does his job (of course, that's not a very big compliment). Dennis Quaid was interesting as Doc Holliday, but not as entertaining as Val Kilmer's Holliday. Gene Hackman as the Earp father has very few minutes on screen. Mark Harmon...misused. Bill Pullman was okay as Ed Masterson. Tom Sizemore somewhat interesting as Bat Masterson. Mare Winningham not at all interesting. I totally missed Jim Caviezel as Warren Earp.No, Kevin, you messed up. And the nearly $40 million loss at the box office rather proves that.Not recommended. It's dull and boring and lasts forever.",Wyatt Earp
24,slightlymad22,Underrated,9,25 August 2016,"Continuing my plan to watch every Kevin Costner movie in order, I come to Wyatt Earp, his second movie from 1994.It's impossible to talk about this movie without mentioning Tombstone, simply because it was released six months before, and focused on the only part of Earps life people care to know about. The gun fight at the OK Coral. One is a mindless popcorn flick, the other is a serious biopic. Audiences flocked to one, and sadly stayed away in droves from the other.Plot In A Paragraph: a biopic of Wyatt Earp (KC) a man who loved his family, and became one of the Wild West's most famous men.Over long, bloated, unfocused, dull, self indulgent, rambling, too serious and ""a flat and uninspired mess"" are all expressions I've heard used when talking about Lawrence Kasdans Wyatt Earp. All unfair in my opinion, one review I read said ""Wyatt Earps biggest problem is that it isn't Tombstone"" what the hell?? When did a movie automatically become a bad one, just because a shorter, flashier version was released 6 months before?? With negative reviews like that, how was the movie meant to have a chance?? With A Perfect World massively under performing and nobody going to see his supporting role in The War, the critics were out in full force to attack KC and they used this movie as a stick to beat him with. It came as no surprise when the movie was nominated for multiple razzie's. Sod the razzie nominations, people often don't realise that this movie was nominated for a single Oscar, one Best Cinematography. I think it should have had more. Wyatt Earp doesn't want to be just one more retelling of the gunfight at the OK Corral. The subject is the whole life span of Wyatt Earp, and is a much more serious movie than the flashier Hollywood pleasing characters portrayed in Tombstone. I don't believe the Russell and Kilmer versions of Earp and Holliday were anything close to real life, I believe Earp was a moody, bad tempered, bad ass like KC plays him, and that Holliday was unpleasant, but loyal like Quaid plays him, not the flashy and fun, but ruthless gambler always ready with a one liner, that Kilmer played. That's not taking anything away from Tombsone and its performances as I enjoy them too, but this movie is more authentic. Whilst it's KC and Dennis Quaid who dominate the movie, from the minute we first see him, KC is in practically everyday scene. Mark Harmon, Bill Pullman and Tom Sizemore all offer solid support, but Gene Hackman is disappointingly under used, and Michael Masden is surprisingly subdued. As well as strong male characters, there are also some strong women too, not commonly found in a western. Catherine O Hara standing out especially. Weirdly though, the only non whore or former one, is the actress Earp falls in love with, and she is often called a whore.I also need to mention the score by James Newton Howard. It's epic.Nobody can accuse KC of playing it safe, he didn't back out of PrinceOf Thieves when another Robin Hood movie was being made at the same time,,and he won. Whilst it would have made sense to pull out here, he stuck to his guns (yes pun intended) but the gamble didn't pay off this time. Despite the negative criticism, scathing reviews and the Tombstone effect, Wyatt Earp still grossed $25 million at the domestic box office (more than the much loved Leon: The Professional) to end the year the 55th highest grossing movie of 1994. Obviously for a movie with a $60 million budget, that was a disappointment. But KC didn't stand still and he was on to his next project before this even opened.",Wyatt Earp
25,tomgillespie2002,"A potentially good film, mishandled by the director",5,21 March 2011,"Being one of the most popular figures of the mystical Old West, Wyatt Earp has been dramatised a countless number of times on the big screen and on television. His notoriety as a no-nonsense lawman, his friendship with the drunken and dying Doc Holliday, and his participation in the legendary gunfight at the O.K. Corrall, has made him the stuff of legend. Of all the portraits, this 1994 epic, directed by Lawrence Kasdan is possibly the most accurate and detailed, following Earp's childhood amongst his many siblings, through to his old age heading to strike lucky during the Gold Rush. It's just a pity that for all it's trying and accuracy, the film isn't at all very good.The film begins on the Earp farm where the young Wyatt is taught the words of wisdom by his father Nicholas (Gene Hackman) - 'blood is thicker than water' - which stays with Wyatt throughout his life. It's clear that his family are important, and he and his brothers are soon grown up and are making a living out on their own. Wyatt is refereeing bare-knuckle boxing matches and is soon making enemies. He romances an old flame who dies tragically, causing the recently-married Wyatt to lose his ways and becomes a drunkard, stealing from good Samaritans who offer him food and shelter. After a visit from his father in prison, he changes his ways and finds himself appointed Deputy Marshal in Wichita, after bravely shooting down a violent drunk when the cowardly sheriff watches. As his reputation as a good lawman grows, he is offered a job in Dodge City along with his brothers Virgil (Michael Madsen) and Morgan (Linden Ashby), where his reputation starts to take a turn for the worse.After the huge success of Dances With Wolves, this film seems to take a similar approach - epic, sweeping storytelling as opposed to the more action-packed angle usually taken when filming an Earp biography. Yet the majority of the film is handled with such a ham-fisted and amateurish approach by Kasdan that the film is nowhere as good as it should be. Kasdan, whose films have mainly consisted of Kevin Kline vehicles, had directed a very young Costner before in a western in the very enjoyable Silverado. It's a strange performance by Costner, who in the first half seems to be sleepwalking his way through his role, delivering his lines like a nervous primary school kid finding himself cast in the lead role. The second half, when he becomes the more Republican, violent Earp, is very good. He can do brooding very well, and even though Wyatt Earp is portrayed as a complete bastard, with Costner playing him he remains an engaging character.Even with all the star actors on show - Madsen, Hackman, Bill Pullman, Tom Sizemore, Jim Caviezel, Jeff Fahey, Isabella Rossellini, Catherine O'Hara, and the excellent Dennis Quaid as Doc Holliday, the film does begin to drag. I almost feel bad saying that, as I have a lot of respect for a director when he takes his time to develop a good story and fully- realised characters, and clocking up a long-running time. But around the 2 hour 30 mark, I found myself wanting the film to end. After the infamous O.K. Corral gunfight (which is refreshingly low-key), the film carries on for another 40 minutes as Earp begins his vendetta against the 'cowboy' gang. In a better directors hands, the last segment could have been a way to portray Earp's fall from grace and his descent into blind blood-lust. But instead it just becomes a long, drawn-out manhunt.Perhaps I'm being harsh, but I feel this was a missed opportunity. Personally, the definitive Wyatt Earp film is John Ford's magnificent My Darling Clementine, and although it may not have the historical accuracy of this, it is a typically mystical, moving, and surprisingly dark masterpiece, featuring a great Henry Fonda performance.www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com",Wyatt Earp
26,Dr_Coulardeau,Decent and famous character,9,30 April 2014,"A true story mind you. So it has to be good. It is well filmed, well presented, suspenseful enough. But the general frame of the western and life on the frontier is not disrupted in any way by any unforeseeable element. A few original points yet.To become the sheriff of a city like Tombstone, or any other of the type, is banal for a horse thief who is running away from justice and the recollection of his first wife who died of diphtheria when pregnant. One deserves a second chance.To have two brothers as his deputies is a lot more original. To get into a rivalry with a gang of bad boys is also banal. But to get through without one wound of any sort while one of his brothers is killed and the other one nearly loses his right arm and will be handicapped if not crippled all his life, is rather more interesting.Then to swear vengeance and to just go away and make sure the gang is destroyed one at a time after the first confrontation that killed a few is banal, but to be married happily on the west coast and to be seen last going to Alaska to take part in a gold rush while the gang members are getting killed is probably less common place.What's left at the end? The vision of an original character, of a man of honor in a situation where honor is rather cheap, of a judge who is honest and of a county sheriff or marshal who is crooked, of a second ""wife"" who is more a fair arrangement to be able to go incognito in the Far West, for both the man and the woman, and finally of the third and last wife who is brought into this western situation as a potential shady lady by a dishonorable male character.What's the most important element is the fact that the three brothers are like one and for them family, and in fact blood is everything that counts, and we could add friendship between a couple of men that makes them absolutely loyal to each other. That's probably what Walt Whitman called the ""manly love of comrades.""Entertaining though slightly long, but a decent intensity all along.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU",Wyatt Earp

This was certainly watchable for the full duration even though I frequently felt Costner was, at times, just reading lines as he didn't add much detail to his script delivery.

29,Nazi_Fighter_David,Kasdan's epic Western proved absorbing,7,21 April 2006,"""Law and Order"" (1932), a film starring Walter Huston and Harry Carey, had blazed the Earp screen trail with a brave version of the 0. K. Corral happenings, although the true-life characters were never named ""Frontier Marshal"" (1939) starring Randolph Scott and ""Wichita"" (1955) with Joel McCrea also told the story To most modern cinema-goers, however, the Corral incident and the confused events and motivations which led to it have been best served by four films, John Ford's ""My Darling Clementine"" (1946), John Sturges' ""Gunfight at the O.K. Corral,"" (1957), Sturges' ""Hour of the Gun"" (1967), and George P. Cosmatos' ""Tombstone"" (1993). But the question has yet to be solved: should the American West be depicted on the screen as it actually was, or should it continue to be a form of mythology? Hollywood's version of history is considerably at variance with the facts, and life on the frontier in the 19th century would appear to have been more dull and monotonous than exciting and colorful Certainly, life in Tombstone, Arizona, in its time of greatest prosperity as a mining town must have been anything but healthy, with its vast number of rough working men relieving their boredom with drinking and brawling, and occasionally shooting each otherIn Kasdan's epic Western, Earp is the upright defender of the law, and Doc, a dissolute gambler Nevertheless, the men are compassionate and respectful, and both have a kind of dignity Holliday is much more credible as the black sheep of an aristocratic Virginia family and a jaded idealist Dennis Quaid allowed himself to lose 30 pounds of his weight only to accurately portray the gun-notorious Doc Holliday, now, alas devoted to the bottle and in the latter stages of tuberculosisIn this instance we have Quaid breathing fire and fury at the slightest hint of an insult before breathing more heavily into his handkerchief He's a multi-dimensional human being who provides most of the film's best moments His character has his own form of ability Quaid does a far better work of portraying the effects of Holliday's tuberculosis Kilmer, in ""Tombstone,"" never seems to have anything worse than a bad flu, except when it's dramatically necessary for him to look bad in greater degree Earp (Kevin Costner) finds Doc sincere but nevertheless strikes up an understanding which one feels will blossom into grudging joint gun-action should the need arise The need is obviously there in villainous Clantons and McLaurys The path is well and truly pointed to that rendezvous at the CorralKasdan's motion picture covers areas of Earp's life that George P. Cosmatos' film ""Tombstone"" does not even touch While ""Tombstone"" was an action picture, centering on the events leading up to and including the famous gunfight, Lawrence Kasdan's ""Wyatt Earp"" focused on the man himself and his life from childhood to the confrontation and beyondThe film starts with the teenage Earp and progresses through old age The action in Kasdan's film is firm and fresh, nicely photographed and the story well told But we always remember Ford's ""My Darling Clementine"" for its other qualitiesfor the unhurried lulls and the 'time off' taken on the way This is Ford indulging himself, as was his habit, but on this occasion the indulgences all come off and are imparted with magic""My Daring Clementine"" was a film of touchesFonda, seated, adjusting his boots and his balance while the world, such as it is, goes by; Fonda, the peacemaker, right-and-properly in church; Fonda, with an old-world frontier concept of courtesy leading his lady in the out of doors danceEarp in Kasdan's biopic is an ordinary man who met and married a beautiful young woman who died of typhoid a short time after the marriage Profoundly bitter about her death, he goes from a drunken fellow to horse thief to buffalo hunter to stagecoach driver to Dodge City, Kansas where he became one of the most famous ""Westerners"" of all time...",Wyatt Earp
30,dworldeater,Under rated and very good 90's western,8,16 July 2015,"Wyatt Earp is film maker Lawrence Kasdan's much overlooked and under-appreciated western epic. Some folks will scoff at the film not being historically accurate, which is a good point. However, at the end of the day Wyatt Earp is still a very good movie. It is certainly well made, the acting is good and has an engaging story of one of the most famous lawmen in the American west. Kevin Costner did a great job here as Wyatt Earp delivering a very good and believable well rounded performance. This project is more of a dramatic piece than an action vehicle, however there is plenty of great action as well. The pacing of the film is fairly quick. While Wyatt Earp clocks in at around 3 hours, it is never boring or self indulgent on the part of the director. Lawrence Kasdan does a hell of a job telling the story and balances the tone of light and dark very well. The film looks great and has an astounding support cast that includes Dennis Quaid, Gene Hackman, Michael Madsen, Tom Sizemore, Bill Pullman, Mark Harmon, Jeff Fahey and more. I think that the success of Tombstone(also a great film by the way) killed the chance of this project to succeed considering they were released at around the same period and Tombstone came first. That being said, it made audiences choose one film or another, which is a shame because both movies are awesome and have different approaches to the subject matter. I am glad that Tombstone gets a lot of props, but this movie is great also and deserves respect as well.",Wyatt Earp
31,Samiam3,bloated but occasionally competent biopic of a legend,6,1 June 2017,"Wyatt Earp offers a broadly scoped tale about the life of the immortal lawman, but it has nothing much to say about him.Earp has earned his place in history for his law enforcement of Tombstone, Arizona which peaked at the legendary gun fight at the O. K. Corrall. Otherwise he had no major accomplishments which warrant a biopic of this length. As the film goes from scene to scene, Director Lawrence Kasdan tries to be objective and dramatically unmanipulative, unlike Tombstone. As a result, you feel like you are watching genuine pieces of history minus a feeling of emotional investment.The first act of the film, starting with Earp as a boy and ending with the death of his first wife, could have been cut out completely. None of this material seems particularly meaningful. Wyatt Earp comes alive around the middle portion with the introduction of Doc Holiday. Filling his shoes is Dennis Quaid whose charisma steals the show and renders Kevin Costner an afterthought.Costner himself is one of the movie's biggest problems. His Wyatt Earp is shamefully dull. It is as if he based his performance on the real mans bland facial expression in his few surviving photographs. What we end up with is a shell of a man who has no fire in his eyes, and he radiates all the stiff ghostliness of a century old mugshot. The movie builds some dramatic momentum toward the O.K. Corrall stand off. This is easily the best scene in the movie even though it lacks the fiery intensity of Tombstone's version.Costumes, make-up and especially photography are all top notch but that's almost inevitable. With a bit of recasting, rewriting and a couple trims, this could have been a more memorable movie.",Wyatt Earp
32,Movie-ManDan,Fans of Kevin Costner and Cowboys Will Love This.,8,5 October 2015,"Wyatt Earp is a pretty low-rated epic on this site. And why? Just because it is not a masterpiece? I consider Wyatt Earp to be a ""near masterpiece""--just need of some more polishing in some areas. Let's face it, Wyatt Earp has no little problems but very few big problems which ultimately cost some fans. I would rather see a movie with no little problems and few big ones than one with many little problems and no big one.One facet that made Wyatt Earp a commercial failure was that is to this day still standing in the shadow of the more successful and better-liked Tombstone from one year prior which also deals with Wyatt Earp. While Tombstone deals with Wyatt Earp and Doc Holliday's regiments in Tombstone, Wyatt Earp is a 3 hour and 10 minute biopic of the lawman's entire life. This film was originally intended to be a six hour miniseries. I wonder if it would have been better that way or if it would have just added fuel to the fire.Wyatt Earp is without question Kevin Costner's most underrated performance. He is low-key but on the whole, very accurate to the real Wyatt Earp; even more than Kurt Russell in Tombstone. Dennis Quaid steals every scene he is in as Doc Holliday. Quaid lost 43 pounds for the role and was closer to the real guy than Val Kilmer in Tombstone.The first chunk of the movie explores Earp's upbringing. He wants to be involved with the law and we all know his wish comes true. The casting call for young Wyatt was smart since the kid looked exactly like Kevin Costner at age 15. He grows up and marries a beautiful woman, but her early death takes a toll on him. I was really liking the movie a little while after her death. But as the story delves deeper into Wyatt's journey as a law enforcer, the movie really seems to lose its overall balance. From then on, the pace of the movie is very uneven and the subplots are all scrambled that make most of the movie quite confusing. The unevenness and bad pacing of the movie are the only two big flaws that impact the movie as a whole. Other than the pacing and unevenness, Wyatt Earp is a great western that almost anyone will enjoy.3.5/4",Wyatt Earp
33,eric262003,Provocative Biopic On Legendary The Legendary Gunslinger,9,4 April 2016,"In the old West one of the most heavily milked upon subject that every fan of Western history will always spring into mind was the event that happened on October 26, 1881, that was the infamous showdown at the O.K. Corral located in Tombstone, Arizona. For many years, filmmakers have been making adaptations and documentaries about this fearsome battle that if you've seen enough of these, it's very hard for you to forget about. In 1993 and 1994, two movies spawned upon this topic came out one after the other that were pretty high in terms of budget. Those two film were ""Tombstone"" from 1993 and ""Wyatt Earp"" from 1994. In a sheer twist of irony, both films were being made pretty much simultaneously and nearing butting heads around the same locations. And while George Cosmatos' ""Tombstone"" emphasized on the epic gunfight itself, Lawrence Kasdan's ""Wyatt Earp"" concentrated on the main character of ""Wyatt Earp"". From his humble beginnings to his deadly showdown and everything else in between Kasdan left nothing out. In 1993, ""Tombstone"" received a substantial amount of praise and well-deserved accolades and was opened more to big box office success. Warner Brothers had to stall ""Wyatt Earp"" from its release months later as to avoid from being on a competitive level with ""Tombstone"". When ""Wyatt Earp"" was released in June of 1994, it still had the warm reception it had like ""Tombstone"", but the box office had a lower impact. My guess was that it came out too soon and people were still buzzing about ""Tombstone"" and just weren't freshening up to this more character driven film. And though it remains the kid brother to ""Tombstone"", it still doesn't mean this movie was terrible. In fact for a biopic, it is a very engaging film that deserves the humble credit it had. For a movie that crawls over the three hour hurdle, this movie literally chronicles Wyatt Earp from his childhood era as he wanted to free himself from his family life to move onto bigger and better things. We watch as he was vital in the building of the famous transcontinental railway lines even down to his personal life from the loss of his first wife his alcoholic phase from becoming an outlaw to throwing his evil ways away to becoming a lawman which eventually led him and his brothers to the big shooting party at the O.K. Corral in Tombstone, Arizona. One of the idiosyncrasies that makes this film special was that Kasdan and co-writer Dan Gordon really put a lot of thought and a lot of care for the material and there's never a dull scene and the narrative remains at a steady pace throughout. The performances were really accurate in it portrayals. Kevin Costner who at the time seemed like an aficionado in the Western genre was the perfect casting choice for the role of the titular character. He just felt his comfort zone in this very complex role. Though Costner carries the heavy cargo in this role doesn't mean that the supporting characters were insignificant. Round out the cast Dennis Quaid was equally riveting as another will known lawman named Doc Holiday. He even molded himself to lose 30 lbs. to look like a sickly man who has tuberculosis. Other well known performers include Michael Madsen as Wyatt's brother Virgil, Gene Hackman as his father Nicholas, Mark Harmon as lawman Johnny Behan, Catherine O'Hara as Allie, Bill Pullman as deputy Ed Masterson, Tom Sizemore as his brother Bat and Isabella Rosselini as a hooker named Big Nose Kate. In spite of this electrifying cast Kasdan ensures that no one gets usurped and no one is left out. The cinematography by Oscar nominee Owen Roizman stands out very well too. Roizman manages to make the landscapes look and feel quite authentic. If I was to say there was a weakness, it would have to be the length of this film. I'm not going to whine about the length, but even for a patient man, this film can be quite long and not very comfortable on the buttocks either. My advice, bring a soft cushion to watch this film, it is that long. After all's said and done, ""Wyatt Earp"" succeeds in being epic and provocative and very rich in both action and character. It displays a crew that enjoyed their work and the heart put into it. The characters were rich and the acting was superb. Sure it was lengthy, but it will still tug at your heartstrings. It's not better than ""Tombstone"", but equally captivating.",Wyatt Earp
34,TheUnknown837-1,an underrated film beautifully realized,9,9 December 2006,"Sadly, a great film such as director Lawrence Kasdan's (Silverado) ""Wyatt Earp"" was not properly realized by the audiences of 1994. Possibly because of Tombstone (basically a film on the same point), having been released only a year prior to it. When comparing ""Tombstone"" to ""Wyatt Earp"", I have to say that they are both good films, although ""Wyatt Earp"" has many points that overpower ""Tombstone"".First of all, we have a great cast of talented actors including Kevin Costner, Dennis Quaid, Gene Hackman, Michael Madsen, Mark Harmon, Jeff Fahey, Joanna Going, Tom Sizemore, and Bill Pullman. I strongly have to disagree with the people who hand out the Razzie Awards. They gave Kevin Costner one for Worst Actor. Although it's definitely not his best performance, it is still very good, not worthy of a Razzie. True, he wasn't so great during the scenes of him as a young man, but when he portrayed Wyatt Earp as a famous lawman during the 1880s, he pulled the job off great. Dennis Quaid's performance of Doc Holliday was excellent and one of his best to date.Music was done by James Newton Howard, who is the most underrated music composer of the day in my book. Howard is one of my favorite composers and he created a mix of excellent scores for ""Wyatt Earp"". The scene where Wyatt Earp, his two brothers, and Doc Holliday walk to the O.K. Corral shootout is a wonderful theme. The film's main score is also memorable.Of course, the one thing that ""Tombstone"" definitely beats ""Wyatt Earp"" by is action and entertainment. The gunfights in ""Tombstone"" are far better than the ones in ""Wyatt Earp"", keeping the audiences interested. And probably the only other thing is pacing. ""Wyatt Earp"" is three hours long and in my personal opinion, a half-hour longer than it needed to be. I could have picked out a few scenes worth removing.""Wyatt Earp"" although receiving some positive reviews from critics, was a box office failure and it won two Razzie Awards (Worst Actor and Worst Remake or Sequel) and it was nominated for several others including Worst Director and Worst Picture. In my opinion, it is a great film that is far too compelling to be worthy for those and it should have been nominated for Academy Awards rather than Razzies. The only Academy Award it got a nomination for was its beautiful cinematography.",Wyatt Earp
35,Richie-67-485852,It's OK and not just The Corral,8,15 July 2015,"Look, its a western! For those that want to travel back into the wild west days and see how it all came together the film delivers. You can critique anything but why? I enjoyed the horses, gun-play, acting and a bit of history too. Hey, pick a character and pretend its you and have some fun with this. One thing you learn about gun-play is that it can turn out many ways all unpredictable too. All who carry and then pull those smoke wagons believe they will prevail. History proves them wrong and the Earp brothers are not immortal either. However, they had a good run! My favorite line? ""It all ends now"".. backed by a shotgun and a few tight friends....Have a tasty drink or two, a decent snack and no texting during the movie except during the love scenes. They are standard here...One more thing, having a pal like Doc Holiday well they may not make them like that anymore...",Wyatt Earp
36,drjgardner,"Long, boring, and not fully developed",4,13 June 2017,"The most famous lawmaker from the old west is Wyatt Earp (1848 – 1929), largely because he survived and actually went to work for Hollywood in his old age during the silent era, hob knobbing with directors John Ford and Raoul Walsh, and actors William Hart, Tom Mix, and Harry Carey. Some say he even had an influence on a young John Wayne.Earp was first featured in the 1923 ""Wild Bill Hickok"" and Earp himself worked behind the scenes with his buddy William Hart (who played Hickok). He appeared again in ""Frontier Marshall"" (1934) and John Ford produced the first notable film about Earp, called ""My Darling Clementine"" (1946).The ""Wyatt Earp"" TV series (1955 – 61) gave birth to the 1957 film ""Gunfight at OK Corral"". John Sturges directed this film and re- visited the era with ""Hour of the Gun"" (1967). In the 1990s, ""Tombstone"" (1993) and ""Wyatt Earp"" (1994) gave us more intense portraits. In Tombstone, we have Kurt Russell (Earp), Val Kilmer (Doc) and Stephen Lang (Ike Clanton) with Sam Elliott and Bill Paxton as the Earp brothers, Powers Boothe as an unredeemable Curly Bill Brocius and Michael Biehn as the deadly Johnny Ringo.Actors who played Earp include Henry Fonda (""My Darling Clementine""), Hugh O'Brien (""Wyatt Earp"" TV series), Burt Lancaster (""Gunfight at OK Corral""), James Garner (""Hour of the Gun""), and Kurt Russell (""Tombstone""). For my tastes, the best Earp was Hugh O'Brien on the TV series, followed by Kurt Russell (""Tombstone"") whom I think was the more realistic Earp.Actors who played Doc Holiday include Victor Mature who played a wonderful coughing Doc Holiday (""My Darling Clementine"") as does Dennis Quaid in this film. Val Kilmer (""Tombstone""), Kirk Douglas (""Gunfight at OK Corral""), Jason Robards (""Hour of the Gun""), and Douglas Fowley (""Wyatt Earp"" TV series) also played Doc. Val Kilmer is my favorite Doc Holiday, though I am partial to TV's Douglas Fawley.Old Man Clanton was played savagely by Walter Brennan (""My Darling Clementine"") but otherwise rarely shown. For villains, no one was as despicable as Walter Brennan (""My Darling Clementine"") although Powers Boothe (""Tombstone"") came close and I was also fond of Michael Biehn (""Tombstone"").Ike Clanton has been played by Robert Ryan (""Hour of the Gun""), Lyle Bettger (""Gunfight at OK Corral""), and Stephen Lang (""Tombstone"")Billy Clanton was played by John Ireland (""My Darling Clementine""), Dennis Hopper (""Gunfight at OK Corral""), and Thomas Haden Church (""Tombstone""). Hopper's cowardly Clanton is the most memorable.The Brothers Earp have been played by Ward Bond and Tim Holt (""My Darling Clementine""), DeForest Kelley and Martin Milner (""Gunfight at OK Corral"")Johnny Ringo has only occasionally been featured in films dealing with Wyatt Earp. He appeared in ""Gunfight at OK Corral"" by John Ireland and in ""Tombstone"" by Michael Biehn.Curly Bill Brocius has only occasionally been featured, by Jon Voight (""Hour of the Gun"") and Powers Boothe in ""Tombstone"". Boothe is the stand-out.With this as background, how does 1994's ""Wyatt Earp"" stand up? Pretty poorly. ""Wyatt Earp"" had Kevin Costner (Earp), Dennis Quaid (Doc), and Jeff Fahey (Ike Clanton) along with a host of women who played the Earp's extended family. We even had Gene Hackman in a cameo as the father. It is a seemingly never-ending tale about Wyatt's entire life, with very little action and almost no character development among the critical players like Ike Clanton, Curly Bill, and Johhny Ringo. As such, it's nearly impossible to understand what is happening. (FWIW – the only film to make an attempt to explain the behind the scenes happenings is ""Tombstone"").This isn't the worst Wyatt Earp film. That honor goes to ""Hour of the Gun"". But it is a colossal waste of talent. The only memorable scene is at the very end of the film.",Wyatt Earp
37,gbheron,Too Long,6,7 March 1999,"The Kasdan/Costner retelling of the rich Wyatt Earp saga takes 190 minutes, covers the entire life of Wyatt Earp from adolescence to old age, and when it's over you feel you hardly understand any of the characters.  And worse yet, don't care to.Outside of Quaid's Doc Holliday, the motivations and driving impulses of the Earps are unstated or contradictory.  In trying to tell the entire story of Wyatt Earp, Kasdan in a sense tells us nothing.Rent Tombstone instead.",Wyatt Earp
38,TOMASBBloodhound,"Rich, ambitious, but just too long.",7,19 August 2007,"Sorry, folks. I just cannot refrain from comparing this film to Tombstone. The fact is they are both very good films, and anyone interested in Wyatt Earp should certainly see both. The films were made at the same time, and comparisons are just impossible to avoid. Wyatt Earp is a more ambitious film, and it clearly looks to pay more attention to real historical accounts, In the end however, it just isn't paced that well, and it lacks the action that Tombstone delivers consistently.Kevin Costner is quite good as Wyatt Earp. The Earp we see in this film is made out to be righteous as a younger man, then jaded and morally ambiguous once his first wife dies tragically. So much of Earp's life is attempted to be recreated by this film. Trouble is, there are not enough definitive historical accounts of some of these periods of Earp's life to substantiate some of what we see. The events told to us in Tombstone make up only about the third act of this film. Before these events, we see Earp work as a boxing referee, a stagecoach driver, a buffalo hunter, and a card dealer. Also, there is a stint in his early life when he attempts to earn a law degree. Unless you are a true Wyatt Earp historian, a lot of it won't seem all that necessary. As the years pass, we meet Earp's brothers, their wives, and other famous lawmen like Bat and Ed Masterson. The cast is uniformly excellent, and there is not a bad performance in the film. Dennis Quaid as Doc Holliday deserves special mention because the performance might well be Quaid's best. He reportedly lost nearly 40 lbs to portray the diseased gunfighter. As good as Kilmer was in Tombstone, Quaid just might be better in this film.Most of the film deals with what made Earp famous. That being his various turns as lawman in such towns as Wichita, Dodge City, and Tombstone. Earp is quick to bash a suspect over the head with his pistol, and he always seems to be on the winning end of a gunfight. Eventually, Earp meets Josephine, an actress with whom he will spend nearly fifty years of his life. Their relationship is handled tenderly and honestly. Other than his love for Josephine and his family, Earp is a morally ambiguous man. That is the idea within the script, anyway.Lawrence Kasdan does a very good job as director. The sets look authentic, and so do the actors. The movie bombed out badly in theaters, though. Perhaps word quickly got out about how long it was and that scared people off. Or maybe they all saw Tombstone first, and it quenched their thirst for a good western. Wyatt Earp, as well as being too long, is hurt by a terrible ending on a boat. Were they trying to channel Heaven's Gate with an inappropriate ending on a boat??? Fear not, this film is infinitely better than that one. However, Wyatt Earp is a reminder of what we learned with Heaven's Gate. A western is not a good genre of film for introspection or revision. Western audiences often expect more action than character development. The verdict: Give this film a chance, but pack you attention span. It's a long one! 7 of 10 stars.The Hound.",Wyatt Earp
39,tonypeacock-1,Overly long wasted opportunity,6,30 April 2020,"The exploits of Wyatt Earps' western history in the late nineteenth century are told in this biographical account of his life.The film is epic in length (over three hours) and production values. However it falls short of other modern Western movies such as Unforgiven released a year earlier that received much greater acclaim.It mainly stars Kevin Costner as Earp. Now I am going to be controversial here. Costner is a wooden actor and I longed for a vintage Clint Eastwood in the role. The movie's lengthy running time could been disected by at least forty minutes. I much preferred Unforgiven and if memory serves me correct the great performance by Gene Hackman in that film. So imagine my disappointment at seeing Hackman relegated to about twenty minutes of screen time.I had more viewing enjoyment watching Gunfight at the O.K. Corrall (1957) starring Burt Lancaster as Earp than this tedious version. Just when you think the film is nearing a conclusion as in the legendary gunfight it goes off at a tangent of revenge killings for another forty minutes! All is not a write off with this film. The production values are great as in production design, cinematography and locations. A wasted opportunity.",Wyatt Earp

Further, its likely to be inaccurate. Costner portrays Earp as a greedy vile man not much different from the villains of the day. The acting honours for me go to Dennis Quaids portrayal of Doc Halliday. This is far too long a film given that it is NOT entertainment but an attempt to put a historical portrayal together of 1 specific life story which isn't done in my view particularly well....PLEASE do not let your kids watch this, given it clearly contains brothels, prostitution, cold blooded murder, brutality with nothing held back. it isn't a film I would encourage anyone to watch twice or depending on age, once!",Wyatt Earp
41,jayraskin1,A Masterpiece that Deals One Plot Too Many,10,1 January 2010,"Wyatt Earp is a masterpiece for about 2 hours and 40 minutes. Unfortunately, the movie is around 3 hours and 10 minutes. There's about 1/2 hour that really needed to be cut. It really taxes the audience and doesn't add anything to the character.The first 2 hours and 30 minutes are brilliant and beautiful. The O.K. corral gunfight and the acquittal of the Earps should have been the climax of the movie. Unfortunately, the movie adds a new story about the killing of Earp's brother and Wyatt getting revenge for it. This half hour revenge story is ugly. There are at least ten killings, more than the rest of the movie and Wyatt just shows his mean and nasty side, which he has already done at several other points in the movie. This 30 minutes is unnecessary and it makes the audience forget the wonderful movie that came before and the beautiful epilogue that comes after.The last ten minutes in Alaska with a flashback of Wyatt standing up to a mob is also excellent. It was just the half hour between the acquittal and Alaska that needed to be taken out.Cinematography, acting, and music are excellent.",Wyatt Earp

44,SkullScreamerReturns,Epic life story of Wyatt Earp,7,16 October 2021,"I've read people comparing ""Tombstone"" and ""Wyatt Earp"" which were released around same time and tell about the same historical figure, so I decided to watch both movies and see which one is the best.While I liked ""Tombstone"" generally a bit better, this movie is not bad either. Its biggest problem is only that the other movie overshadows it a bit and partly they tell the same story.""Wyatt Earp"" paints a long and epic picture of the life story of the man of the same name. While ""Tombstone"" was about his latter days, here here we start from his childhood and move through different phases, up until to the Tombstone days.Kevin Costner is a bit wooden in the lead role, especially compared to Kurt Russell's version in the other movie. But not bad. When Earp starts drinking, Costner makes him look really miserable, but then later he gets back in the saddle and is a completely different man. Dennis Quaid makes a good Doc Holliday. Gene Hackman is another big name but he's only in the beginning playing Wyatt's father. Generally the cast is ok.The music I disliked a bit, especially in the beginning it was a bit too disney-ish or spielberg-ish ""adventure music"" that brings to my mind images of pirate islands and such, and not wild west. But when the movie progressed the musical styles had more variety and it didn't bother me later as much.Conclusion: for fans of westerns I recommend ""Tombstone"" more, it has more punch. But for those who want to learn about the whole life story of Wyatt Earp, this one has more to offer. Also anyone else who likes long epics and adventures this is a good choice to watch.",Wyatt Earp
45,MovieCriticOnline,Worth watching but does have flaws,7,17 January 2021,"I just rewatched this for the first time in a long time. I remember having fond feelings about it. You can definitely tell the difference between most movies made today and movies from 10 years or prior ago. Much more focus on story, characters and relationships than the present focus on action and special effects and PC wokeness culture.Here, they took the time to show who Wyatt was as a man. I know there has been criticism of the accuracy, which might be true but isn't germane to to my review because I think some of the basic facts are correct. Where he came from, who his family was, where he lived, what happened to him and who died etc.Yes, I agree with others it is a bit slow, but not slow enough to totally lose interest. What I did like is they showed him as a complicated person not as a folklore hero without flaws, but with many flaws that tore apart himself and his family in many ways.Dennis Quaid was great and almost unrecognizable and lifted up every scene he was in. Kostner was fine and for the most part the others too. There is so much bad acting i movies in general it makes it hard to watch, but this was good.For my criticism I would say the music stood out to me the most. It was too in your face and used to force emotions when none would have worked so much better. Take No Country For Old Men that had no music and worked fine. I also think it was too loud at times making it stand out too much. Music is supposed to blend in and be subtle most of the times unless there is a reason not to. I think it would have been better without any music and quicker cutting.The music added to the feeling of a TV movie, which is kinda felt like, especially with some of the drama which was pushed a bit too hard. It didn't feel as authentic as it could have. That comes down to the execution of the director.I also think the main villains were treated with less importance than they should have. We never really got to know them well. It was lowered to quick arguments over the city ordinance they didn't want to comply with but Wyatt Earp is known for his feud with them so they could have been more focused to raise the stakes. Think Darth Vader and Luke Skywalker. Both were treated equally in their respected stories so when they finally meet for battle there is much more emotional involvement at stake.Sure movies can work without getting to know the villain but even Gladiator we got to know Joaquin Phoenix's characters which made him more complicated and the story more complicated.Also I know it's based on a true story, but some of the characters introduced like Bat were left behind after a long introduction to never ben seen again. I think ti would have been better to do shorter intros, if at all, and just focused on the characters like his brothers more who eventually became much more of an integral part of the story, but we didn't get to know much. E.g. we got to to know Tom Sizemore more than Michael Madsen.In any event, it is refreshing to watch a movie that is more deliberate in the way it builds its characters etc.Worth watching for sure among the sea of subpar movies being made.",Wyatt Earp

Cosner is not the greatest actor in history, but he is likable enough to enjoy his movies. Here he is just plain stiff, wooden, emotionaless and boring. It is all about Kevin and his ego. He is in virtually in every scene and he is doing nothing at all. There is absolutely no chemistry between him and his leading ladies. Anyhow, if you like Kevin in the morning and Kevin in the evening and Kevin at suppertime, then you will like this film. If not, forget about it and watch Kurt Russell in Tombstone.",Wyatt Earp
47,bh_tafe3,Just turn it off after he leaves Dodge City and watch Tombstone,7,6 February 2016,"It's a well known cliché of Hollywood that they tend to release things in twos. Remember Deep Impact and Armageddon hitting at about the same time? How about Volcano and Dante's Peak? Red Planet and Mission to Mars (OK, no one remembers that one). Well in 1994 there were two films made looking at the life of famous lawman Wyatt Earp. The first, George P Cosmatos' Tombstone, looked only at Earp's time spent in the city of the title, focusing on the events leading up to and following the Showdown at the OK Corral. This film, a labour of love from Lawrence Kasdan, fashions Earp's life into an epic story of love and the binds of family in a lawless land.There is much to admire about the first half of the film, the part of me that is still a young boy who grew up watching John Wayne westerns with his father loves the shots of a herd of wild Buffalo, row after row of corn fields, cowboys riding on horseback through parched desert, and saloon shootouts all happening to a suitably grandiose soundtrack. This part of the film is pure western film making. It's nice to see Earp (Kevin Costner) interact with his father (Gene Hackman), see him go from a young law student who ""never killed anyone"" to a widower horse thief on the lam who bumps into the Masterson brothers, Ed (Bill Pullman) and Bat (Tom Sizemore) while hunting Buffalo. We see him work as a card dealer for his brother James (David Andrews) and then unwittingly become a lawman after taking down a gun toting drunk. It's kind of cool to meet his other brothers Morgan (Linden Ashby) and Virgil (Michael Madsen), but around now, we are starting to get weighed down by too many characters. I'm still on board as we see Earp get banished from Dodge City and becomes a bounty hunter, meeting Doc Holliday (Dennis Quaid-very good) and then returning to Dodge City with his brothers to clean it up after the Sheriff is killed.And this is really where you should turn it off and watch Cosmatos's film. In the second half, Kasdan gets bogged down trying to maneuver around far too many characters, which is further exacerbated by placing Earp into a love triangle that takes up far too much time and focus, just as the movie is headed towards the climactic showdown at the OK Corral. Following said showdown, things continue to go fairly slowly, we get yet more time donated to Earp's love life while there are far more interesting things going on. From there it's a slog to the finish line, where we get a great flashback scene of Earp talking down a lynch mob. These are the scenes we want to see, not a girl drinking herself to death because her common law husband is sleeping with a prettier woman. Cosmatos was able to convey this without using up as much screen time.It's a shame the film get bogged down in its second half because Costner, Quaid, Sizemore, Hackman, Cinematographer Owen Roizman, and Composer James Newton Howard are all up for this and in fine form. Ultimately though, the film suffers from having too many characters, too much of a bland ,love triangle and being in the shadow of the more action oriented Tombstone, which took a more economical look at the same events. For its first half however, Wyatt Earp is both gorgeous to look at and an entertaining origin story of one of the most heavily mythologized figures of the American Wild West. Costner gives us an Earp that, if not capturing what the actual man was like, captures what he should have been like, while Quaid is not as memorable as Kilmer, but still excellent as Holliday.Wyatt Earp is something of a missed opportunity due to a weak second half, but is far from worthless. Helpfully on the DVD release I own, the first disc ends right when Earp cleans up Dodge City. For viewers this is a pretty good time to take it out and watch Cosmatos' Tombstone instead of disc 2. As a matter of fact, I may do that right now...",Wyatt Earp
48,jcbutthead86,A Flawed But Beautifully Filmed And Well Acted Epic Western Biopic About The Legendary Lawman.,8,2 July 2013,"Wyatt Earp is a flawed but beautifully filmed and wonderfully acted Epic Western Biopic that has great direction,a fantastic cast,glorious cinematography and a powerful score that makes Wyatt Earp a good and almost great film that sadly falls short of being a Masterpiece.Wyatt Earp tells the epic story of legendary Lawman Wyatt Earp(Kevin Costner)from his days as a teenager to when he became a Marshal and participated in The Gunfight At The O.K Corell and it's aftermath and the the journey of Wyatt Earp who deals with the law,his family and love in his journey throughout the West.Released in 1994,Wyatt Earp was the second of two Wyatt Earp films this film being released six months after the classic Western Tombstone. While Tombstone was a critical and Box Office hit grossing 55 million dollars on a 25 million dollar budget,Wyatt Earp was a critical and Box Office failure grossing 25 million dollars on a 63 million dollar film budget and was considered the weakest of the two Wyatt Earp films. But Wyatt Earp isn't a bad film in my opinion it's a pretty good film that has some merits. What's good about this film is that Wyatt Earp tells the Wyatt Earp story that many viewers have never seen before telling us a story of how Wyatt Earp became Wyatt Earp that we know in the West and history books showing Wyatt in his early life when he was a wagon driver,a buffalo hunter and gambler and telling us in an epic scope. Wyatt Earp gives us a dark character study of a man who is flawed and has to deal with the good and bad times of what Wyatt Earp went through from when he was a teenager to when he was a grown up and shows how Wyatt goes from the happy optimistic young man to a cold hearted lawman he became in his later years. WE is an epic in the truest since of the word(with the length at 3 hours and 11 minutes)and you can feel the epic when your watching the film because WE is filled with beautiful shots of the Western land and everything in the film is bigger than life. Owen Roizman's beautiful Oscar nominated cinematography is just amazing and it gives WE an epic feel as well as dark and grim Film-Noir atmosphere especially during the night time scenes where we as the viewers see dark blue lighting that is wonderful to look at but very surreal and I think it adds to the film. While WE is wonderfully filmed the movie has a few if not many flaws. Despite being 3 hours plus WE feels uneven at times where some of the main characters come in and out with no explanation and none of the main characters with the exception of Wyatt Earp,Doc Holliday(Dennis Quaid) and Josie Marcus(Joanna Going) have depth. The friendship with Doc and relationship with Josephine are the only things in the film that are developed well and bring some life into the film. Also the relationship between Wyatt and his brothers Virgil Earp(Michael Madsen)and Morgan Earp(Linden Ashby) while good feels flat at times where you feel like that Wyatt Earp's brothers are not characters but cardboard cut outs that have no feeling or depth. I think one of the reasons Tombstone is a better film than WE is because it told a much better and clearer story and seems it knew what story it wanted to tell and in Tombstone the relationship between the Earp brothers is real and full of emotion and with WE you don't get that here. The famous Gunfight At The O.K Corell scene in WE while good feels like just regular and nothing special and when it happens it just ends where as the O.K Corell fight in Tombstone was more suspenseful and filled with tension and when you watch the gunfight in Tombstone you are on the edge of your seat and nervous when the guns start to go off. The ending of the film is good and epic and in someways adds to the Wyatt Earp legend and is a good cap off to this film.The whole cast does a great job. Kevin Costner does a wonderful job as Wyatt Earp,with Costner bringing optimism,sadness and grit to the role. Dennis Quaid gives a brilliant performance as Doc Holliday,with Quaid being gruff,aggressive and intense and has great scenes with Costner. The always great Gene Hackman is fantastic in his short role as Wyatt's Father Nicholas Earp and has a few wonderful scenes. Michael Madsen(Virgil Earp)and Linden Ashby(Morgan Earp)do fine jobs as Wyatt Earp's brothers. Bill Pullman and Tom Sizemore do wonderful jobs as lawmen Ed and Bat Masterson,friends of Wyatt Earp. Jeff Fahey(Ike Clanton)and Lewis Smith(Curly Bill Brocis)do great jobs as The Cowboys,the villains of the film. Joanna Going is amazing and beautiful as Josephine 'Josie' Marcus,Wyatt's love interest. Mark Harmon does a great job as Sheriff Behan,a corrupt sheriff and Josie's fiancé. Mare Winningham is just fantastic as Mattie Earp,Wyatt's wife. Also,lookout for small cast appearances from David Andrews(James Earp),Isabella Rossellini(Big Nose Kate),Catherine O'Hara(Allie Earp),JoBeth Williams(Bessie Earp),Rex Linn(Frank McLaury),Adam Baldwin(Tom McLaury),James Gammon(Mr Sutherland), Jim Caviezal(Warren Earp),Annabeth Gish(Urilla Sutherland),Tea Leoni(Sally),Mackenzie Astin(Francis O'Rourke)and Martin Kove(Ed Ross).The direction by Lawrence Kadsen is excellent,Kadsen always moving the camera and giving the film a big,epic feel giving a realistic look to the Western time period as well as a great visual style. Great direction by Kadsen.The score by James Newton Howard is just brilliant,epic,big and powerful and matches the epic,Western tone of the film. A beautiful score from Howard.In final word,if you love Westerns,The history of Wyatt Earp,Kevin Costner,Lawrence Kadsen or biopics,I recommend you see Wyatt Earp,a flawed,but wonderfully acted and beautifully filmed Western Epic that's not as good as Tombstone,but a good Western film in it's own right. Recommended. 8.5/10.",Wyatt Earp
49,rollernerd,The Enforcer,6,26 September 2021,"Welcome back to another edition of Adam's Reviews!! **queue in intro music**Today's movie review is he biographical western Wyatt Earp (1994) starring the ever-likeable Kevin Costner as the title character, a real-life figure rooted in American history. This epic movie is 3 hours long which follows Wyatt's life as a gambler, a husband, a thief, a buffalo hunter, an entrepreneur and a lawman. To me this should of being a mini or limited series, but I guess this approach wasn't popular in the 90s. Due to the length the film does feel uneven and sometimes confusing. At one stage I was getting ready for Wyatt and his loyal trustful friend Doc Holiday (played by Dennis Quaid) to track down ruthless outlaw Dave Rudabaugh. Not sure if this even happened. The production designs also felt uneven, as if I was in a movie theme park where you see clumsy fencing around the al fresco in a lunch scene. I have no clue about the history of the characters portrayed in this film, so not interested in factual event but little things like production sets do not match with the era or not designed on point does show out. The story portrays the title character both on a fictional level and as myth.The main actors who stand out are the main three cast, Costner, Quaid and Gene Hackman. Every Hackman dialogue was a quote on point, where you want to write it down and think it over. Quaid as Doc Holliday was superb, you can see him materialising into the role both as an actor and on a physical level by actually having a gaunt appearance due to the actual Doc Holliday was dying of tuberculosis. His personality brings life to the film and it's a shame he was underused. This is pretty much how the other actors in the entire film are treated - underused. I get it - it should be about Wyatt but it would have been nice to see more interactions with himself and the main cast. There some animosities between Wyatt and a few characters which I did not understand and felt there was more to the story between Wyatt and sheriff Behan and outlaw Ike. I get it - the western era was a tough time, full of grit and heaps around the prospecting which is show in Tombstone where we see a large number of men either drinking and brawling and occasionally shooting each other - but the film failed to tackle on issues in the past such as the harsh treatments on Chinese families, harsh realities around slavery and the flow on effects of Post-Civil War in America.Costner does well in getting your attention as Wyatt however his dialogue makes the performance too shut off and further flat. Which again brings me back to Quaid, the bloke literally is breathing fire and fury at the slightest hint of an insult before breathing more heavily into his handkerchief - that's a multi-dimensional performance. During the entirety of the film there are editing issues which again makes a few scenes questionable for instance the courtroom where the Earp's are not given any sentence. It is also a shame that the female leads did not have much greater purpose than to be seen clinging to their menfolk. Didn't the woman also have shooting skills in an era where there was always a need for self-defence? Overall. 6/10.",Wyatt Earp
50,jeremy3,Uneven but unapologetic biopic,6,21 September 2006,"There have been tons of westerns about the Wyatt Earp/Doc Holliday saga. The critics are right. The movie is long, and at times boring. Sometimes, I don't think that Kevin Costner is a great actor, but then in other scenes he's is surprisingly good. The movie is a patently machoistic movie about revenge. With these criticisms aside, I have to say the movie was more honest than most of the John Wayne westerns. Wyatt Earp and Doc Holliday were admirable, but not likable. Wyatt Earp was a mean man in many ways. His father was a down-to-Earth man (played by Gene Hackman), who brought Wyatt up with a strict sense of morality. The elder Earp taught his son that family is everything, that when you make up your mind about something you have to do it all the way, and that once you go down the road of the bottle and a life of crime the only way out is your death. Wyatt goes towards a life of crime after the death of his wife. His father rescues him and says go out West if you want to not be hanged. Wyatt goes out West, and becomes the famous lawman. He is not nice. He uses a prostitute for sex, but then cruelly discards her when he falls for another woman. He gets his deputies behind him, but they almost all die violent deaths. When a Clanton family gets in a feud with Wyatt, Wyatt goes ballistic when they kill his brother (one of his deputies). In his feuds, he becomes an outlaw by those who don't like his violent approach towards criminals. The West is becoming a land of laws. Ironically, Wyatt helped change the West into a place of laws. Dennis Quaid plays Doc Holliday. Doc Holliday was once a dentist. He only lived to Age 36. Quaid gives a great portrayal as a terminally ill, alcoholic man, who has great character and charm, but has no friends in the World left (due to his lifestyle). You see in Quaid's portrayal a man dying, but yet still being a brilliant gunfighter. In the end, the Clanton family is nearly wiped out. Instead of feeling good about it, you don't find anything to admire. I have to admit that this movie did show the Old West as a tough place. You are left with an anti-heroic impression of the lawmen. You don't like them that much, other than that they are the law. People were lucky to find work in those days. Many westerns don't focus at all on the ""boom"" and ""bust"" cycle of the West, and how people were looking for ways to earn a living (all the time). The life was hard and violent. The West was hardly romantic. In addition, you see the evolution of the West. The West didn't stay the same. It was changing throughout the movie. For that I say, while not a great movie, it was an honest, unique portrayal.",Wyatt Earp
51,SMLA11,Good enough movie,9,20 May 2002,"The movie was good enough on most of its parts.  First of all, the acting was very good and the script was very good.  The only problem I had with this movie is that it was a little bit boring.  Most of the movie and dialogue was top of the notch excellent but it got a tad bit boring.Overall this movie was very cool and I thought that it depicted Wyatt Earp's life well and Kevin Costner and Dennis Quaid are awesome.  Rating 9 out of 10.",Wyatt Earp
52,rhinocerosfive-1,Mediocrity as Grandiose as All Outdoors,3,4 August 2008,"This is a Lawrence Kasdan movie, only more so: more saccharine than ""Accidental Tourist,"" more on-the-nose than ""Mumford,"" more pretentious and overwrought than ""Grand Canyon,"" even more absurdly sentimental than ""Dreamcatcher"" and ""Big Chill"" combined, this picture aims at John Ford and hits Joel Schumacher. While making overtures to brutal realism, this film's most constant refrain is a cloy that would have choked Victor Fleming. However, it offers up some of my very favorite movie gunfights, most of them brief and ugly, several of which involve no shooting at all. Much of the violence is sudden and scary, the only convincing element of this muddled Capra-corn-meets-John Milius concoction. But even this attribute is occasionally discarded. ""Wyatt Earp"" is perhaps the only Western confused enough about its own intentions to present a gritty double homicide, in which gunplay is revealed as a cold and deadly business, back-to-back with a consequence-free getaway from inept bushwhackers, with dozens of bullets exchanged to a rollicking good-time score and nobody hurt but a bad guy's horse. Also in the grand Kasdan tradition, ""Wyatt Earp"" features a dream cast doing nightmarishly bad work. They are abetted by dialog straight out of Cliff's Notes. Sure, Gene Hackman has phoned in his share of roles, and Dennis Quaid proves time and again (""Dinner with Friends,"" ""Alamo"") that you had better keep him on a shorter leash than he is allowed in this uneven performance. But when was Michael Madsen ever this boring, or Tom Sizemore this limp? Kevin Costner trades the earnest Everyman of ""Dances with Wolves"" for this stilted, one-note simpleton - though, to be fair, he is much more comfortable as the older Wyatt than as the yokel kid. Some of the women buck the trend: Mare Winningham is appropriately tragic, and Joanna Going shows she deserved a better career, if this spunky, oddly nuanced performance is any indication. But Annabeth Gish embarrasses herself further than her limited screen time would seem to make possible, and Catherine O'Hara indicates that some types of genius are not a movable feast.Perhaps the movie's greatest handicap is its travelogue format, the hack director's traditional recourse when attempting an epic. Every third scene is a poorly disguised excuse for exposition. All the big moments feel small, because no flat, mishandled attempt at a glory-note can stand out among so much dull connective tissue. The whole thing feels like a hurry-up production: few of the actors make more than a shallow investigation of the gravity demanded by the melodrama. You can sense the grips hovering just off camera, ready to break into the next set-up. In an unnecessarily cruel note, all this nothing is accompanied by James Newton Howard, conjuring the pale shade of Randy Newman circa ""The Natural."" The corn is green indeed.Okay, okay. It's not all bad. Madsen and Quaid have their moments, and it would be a lie to say that the exteriors aren't photographed very nicely. Maybe, as touted, it is a more accurate history of this American icon than ""My Darling Clementine."" But, and I only bring it up because of the inevitable comparison, it is a far inferior piece of work in every way. I like Jeff Fahey, but he's no Walter Brennan. And I'll say it though it goes without saying: Howard Hawks, Kasdan ain't.Of course, this movie had the more immediate misfortune to be released almost concurrently with ""Tombstone,"" a film best remembered for Val Kilmer's outrageously entertaining turn as the guy who played Doc Holliday better than Dennis Quaid. Most of the rest of that George Cosmotos effort consists of me trying not to laugh at Kurt Russell's mustache. I think ""Tombstone"" will go down in history as a movie that succeeded because it was slightly less ridiculous than ""Wyatt Earp,"" which, except for the incongruous action sequences, deserves the cinematic Boot Hill where it has been interred. Now, if only Kasdan would follow it... metaphorically, of course.",Wyatt Earp
53,NanoFrog,"Boring, stiff meandering nonsense",3,26 October 2021,"Mistake Number One: Madson as Holiday. This is one of the most foolishly cast roles ever. He is unwatchable, drags down the entire film. Mistake Number Two, Dennis Quade. Equally unwatchable. And the errors pile up from there. The opening sequences are historical nonsense, boring nonsense that does nothing for the narrative. And it just goes downhill from there. Tedious. Slow-moving, contrived fake history. Costner can be great when he is just an actor: but when he becomes a producer and film maker he just makes nonsense. The cast is to big, the photography is to dry, the acting is stiff and contrived across the board. This film is a historic waste of talent, time and money. I have tried to watch it four times now, over the years, and I just cannot do it.",Wyatt Earp
54,skoyles,Overly long and far too short,8,19 June 2006,"When I saw ""Wyatt Earp"" in the theatre upon its release, I thought it a bit too long; having seen it again several times on video and DVD, most recently today, I find ""Wyatt Earp"" far too short. Each of the deleted scenes should have been included to preserve the artistic balance of the film, e.g the Arkansas jailing with the Tombstone jailing. Costner, I believe, captures the psychology of Wyatt Earp better than anyone before him. The writing is the first of which I know to set grief as the central motivation of Wyatt's life, leading to a life lived as a ""dry drunk"". Is this romanticism or good history? I do not believe I am alone in seeing Wyatt as irreparably scarred by Urilla's tragic death and found this film refreshing in this regard. Costner (hardly a favourite of mine) portrays the wounded Wyatt to sad perfection. Of course I prefer Kurt Russell's version, or Hugh O'Brien's, for they are more personable, enjoyable and attractive. Costner's hint of self-righteousness (while living in less than righteous ways) captures something of the real Wyatt Earp who was praised by a Presbyterian minister and charged with pimping. That Costner could successfully portray Wyatt Earp from youth to old age, and do so with such conviction, redounds to his praise as an actor. Quaid deserved an Oscar nomination; Madsen has never been better; Going glows. Story-telling makes for inaccuracies; this is not a documentary. Yet I do wish that some computer whiz could replace the clothing and holsters in this movie with the superbly perfectly accurate ones of ""Tombstone"".",Wyatt Earp
55,gws-2,A near miss,7,12 September 2005,"""Wyat Earp"" had the misfortune to be released not long after the classic ""Tombstone,"" which told the same story. Nevertheless, ""Wyat Earp"" is a laudable effort and well worth the time to sit through its three hours and fifteen minutes running time.The performances were uniformly good, with a skeletal Dennis Quade particularly fine as the doomed Doc Holliday. In fact, I thought that Quade's funny and moving performance as Doc Holliday was in the same class as Val Kilmer's portrayal of the same character in ""Tombstone."" The women playing the Earp wives, Catherine O'Hara, JoBeth Williams, Mare Winningham, and Betty Buckley, were also very effective. The beautiful Joanna Going was a pleasure to watch as Josie Marcus, the woman who Wyat Earp spent the last 47 years of his life with. Unfortunately, her acting skills did not match her beauty.The thing that makes the film rise above the mediocre to me is its stunning visual and aural beauty. Its 5.1 Dolby Digital soundtrack is world class, and its outdoor photography is evocative.Recommended, 7 out of 10.",Wyatt Earp
56,FilmSnobby,*Tombstone* is better.,3,18 September 2005,"I see the debate is lively here as to which was the better 1993 take on the Earp legend, Kasdan's *Wyatt Earp* or Cosmatos' *Tombstone*. If you prefer the former, fair enough, but I'm about to demonstrate why you're mistaken. But the main thrust of my proof is against those here who are petulantly declaring that the two movies shouldn't be compared.Ah, but if you're presuming to form a critical opinion about this movie, they SHOULD be compared, because the comparison lays bare the fundamental problem with Kasdan's approach to the material. Namely, the director -- who, by the way, I respect, believing him to be a more accomplished director than Cosmatos -- is trapped by an overlong, meandering script whose entire first half should have been redacted with red ink. Okay, here's the problem: after an anticipation-building introduction on the morning of the O.K. Corral gunfight, we're primed for action . . . or at least, we're primed for the build-up leading to the incipient gunfight. But, NO! -- we tumble back all the way to the Civil War era, in which a teenage Wyatt Earp tries to run away from his home to go join his older brothers in the fight. A forceful Gene Hackman as the patriarch nips this in the bud, and furnishes frontier-spun mottoes to the precocious youth that are supposed to explain Wyatt's conduct and personality later in the film. The movie meanders on. We see Wyatt as a young man driving stagecoaches. He travels all around the West, but is saving his heart for a genteel lady back in Missouri. We see him court the young lady. (For 10-15 minutes.) He marries the young lady. Who, by the way, we know from the get-go is going to drop dead. Finally she does, followed by Wyatt going on a tear as an alcoholic horse-thief. We await for someone to bail him out of jail (after all, how can be in Arizona 15 years later if he's going to get hung in Arkansas?); someone does. We're not done. A somewhat surlier Wyatt spends some time as a buffalo-hunter in Kansas, hiring the Masterson brothers as skinners. We sit watching all this numbly, waiting for him to finally get deputized in Dodge. Finally, he does. After which, Kevin Costner's mullet gets trimmed and petroleum jelly is applied atop his head. Uh, we're still not in Arizona, yet. We watch Wyatt keep the peace in Dodge for a while. He calls Bill Pullman's Ed Masterson ""affable"" several times (this is meant to be an insult). Wyatt's brothers, or some of them anyway, show up with their wives, who resent his high-handed manner and his insistence on moving them all to Tombstone, Arizona with the intention of striking it rich on mining claims. We MUST be getting close to the action, because the characters are talking about Tombstone, but . . . nope, we have to wait till Wyatt is fired by the Dodge City fathers for his head-bashing tactics, which impels him to work as a U.S. Marshall for awhile, the purpose of which is to enable him to meet Doc Holliday (a splendid, emaciated Dennis Quaid) for the first time. The latter, when speaking to Wyatt, ends each of his sentences with ""Wyatt Earp?"" -- as in, ""Do you believe in friendship, Wyatt Earp?"" or even ""How are your teeth, Wyatt Earp?"" This goes on for 5 minutes or so.Cut, cut. Take out the red pen and swiftly slash lines through all the preceding material. If you're going to tell the Tombstone episode of Wyatt Earp's life, then we don't CARE about any of that other stuff. We don't CARE why Wyatt is the way he is; we'll accept his legend at face value, for God's sake. Sheesh! If you want to tell a story about Young Wyatt Earp, Old Wyatt Earp, or some other aspect of Wyatt Earp, then tell that story. Compare how Cosmatos handled this material in his *Tombstone*: after introducing us to the principal villains, we see the Earp brothers step off the train in Tombstone. See? Simple! I mean, Kasdan tries to make the most out of all the unnecessary material -- that introduction scene, for example, between Costner and Quaid IS kind of funny -- but you just can't cram a mini-series into a 3-hour movie. If we're doing the Tombstone stuff, then get to the damn point, already. As it is now, the movie has wasted so much time with irrelevancies that there's little space left to show why the Earps and Clantons are heading for a showdown in the first place. Wyatt's girlfriend Josie pleads, ""Why? I don't understand it!"" Neither do we. The movie can only come to rickety halt with an unexciting final shootout in the desert, followed by a tacked-on denouement on a cruise ship.Finally, Kasdan is not helped any by Kevin Costner. As the young Wyatt, Costner unconvincingly portrays him as a slightly retarded rube. And once the petroleum jelly makes its appearance, Costner falls back onto his Surly Mode: grumpy, expressionless, tending toward psychosis. He's always saying things like, ""For two years I've been in a bad mood"", or ""I'm not in the mood"", or ""I don't care anymore"", or ""I'm Wyatt Earp -- it all ends now!"" Jeez, what a dour hero. Compare this with Kurt Russell's take on the man: a genial guy looking for a good time, tempered into toughness by the lawlessness of the Old West, but still able to smile. Costner's stern Puritan interpretation belies much of what we see Wyatt actually doing, such as dealing faro in saloons in which he owns a quarter-interest, or sharing his bed with former prostitutes and traveling showgirls. His performance is all wrong for such a man. I, for one, couldn't care less about this sourpuss.3 stars out of 10.",Wyatt Earp
57,basilisksamuk,TV mini-series pretending to be a proper movie,5,14 November 2012,"Not that I'm obsessive but I managed to watch 3 versions of the OK Corral story in the last week – Wyatt Earp, Tombstone and My Darling Clementine. Wyatt Earp is easily the least impressive of the three though it's not without its merits.One of the truly awful things about this movie is the music. Never a scene goes by which isn't accompanied by the most tacky overblown orchestration to ever not grace a movie. The music and some of the more tacky scenes in the film actually make the film look more as though it should have been a TV mini-series where it would have been more acceptable.As a movie it's too long. Everything leading up to the death of Earp's first wife is superfluous. Yes it's good to see Gene Hackman giving another great performance but it wasn't necessary. We just needed to know that she died and Earp didn't get over it to understand some of his motivations. The final section when Earp is older is also unnecessary and adds to the TV mini-series quality of the enterprise.In the middle we have something better. Costner isn't the best actor in the world but he isn't the worst either. He does a decent solid job of playing this part. All the supporting actors do a decent job too but neither Costner or any of the other players are as good and as believable as their counterparts in Tombstone. Dennis Quaid gives the best performance in the film though even he can't match Val Kilmer's Doc Holliday in Tombstone.So a decent enough film but never rises above the level of a TV movie.",Wyatt Earp
58,DeuceWild_77,Kasdan & Costner re-teaming in this underrated semibiographical western on the life of lawman Wyatt Earp !!,9,7 February 2018,"Released just 1 year after the similar ""Tombstone"", ""Wyatt Earp"" was the Kevin Costner's response to Kevin Jarre's script, focused more on the central character of Wyatt since his upbringing, instead of the side characters that bring nothing to the film.Teaming again with Lawrence Kasdan after ""The Big Chill"" ('83) and the way popular ""Silverado"" ('85), that helped to resurrect the western genre in modern times, Kevin Costner, this time also as a producer and taking the lead role of the intrepid Wyatt Earp, both deliver an insightful semibiographical western film about the life of the legendary lawman since he was a boy in his family farm in Missouri to his later days in the Gold Rush in Alaska.With ""Silverado"" and his personal tryumph, ""Dances with Wolves"" in his resume, Costner moves comfortably in the western genre and provides a good performance as the stubborn and ruthless Wyatt Earp, giving him the needed humanity as a man who lost the love of his life and became cold and emotionless, only believing in kinship and that the law should prevail in the wild west, until he mets Josie Marcus, a daring actress and falls in love again.The movie is overlong and in the first hour the pace moves like a snail, but like an old american epic it takes time to establish the character(s) for telling their story(ies), even if some scenes were cut out to shorten the movie for another half a hour, creating then some loose ends for certain subplots and side characters, but at least was less disjointed than ""Tombstone"" in that matter.The production values are all splendid invocating the Old West, especially the beautiful cinematography by Owen Roizman, nominated for an Academy Award and the orchestration by James Newton Howard which reminds a lot of Bruce Broughton's score in ""Silverado"".The cast is good, but not as great as the rival ""Tombstone"", featuring besides Costner, Dennis Quaid who stole the movie as the lunger Doc Holliday, Wyatt's best friend and right hand, the actor is almost unrecognizable skinny playing the character and provides a memorable haunting performance that deserved to be Oscar nominated (he was even better than the amazing Kilmer's rendition of Doc); Gene Hackman in an extended cameo as the patriarch Earp; Michael Madsen, David Andrews, Linden Ashby & Jim Caviezel (in an earlier role) playing respectively, Virgil, James, Morgan & Warren Earp with Catherine O'Hara, JoBeth Williams (re-teaming with Kasdan after ""The Big Chill"") & Alison Elliott playing their wives with Annabeth Gish, Mare Winningham & Joanna Going portraying the three wifes of the long life of Wyatt Earp.The villains are less showy here than ""Tombstone"" and barely got decent screentime with the exception of Jeff Fahey (re-teaming with Kasdan after ""Silverado"") as Ike Clanton and Lewis Smith as Curly Bill Brocius.
Strangely, the Johnny Ringo character way prominent in ""Tombstone"" as played greatly by Michael Biehn is only mentioned in the third act and was played by a stuntman.Mark Harmon as the sleazy Sheriff Johnny Behan; Tom Sizemore and Bill Pullman as the brothers Masterson, Wyatt's lawmen and Isabella Rossellini in the tiny role of Big Nose Kate, Doc Holliday's mistress complete the main cast.In short, ""Wyatt Earp"" flopped hard when it was released and was bashed by critics because of its length, slow pace and too much focus on Costner's character, with ""Tombstone"" being the critics and fans' favorite, but besides its all-star cast, fast pacing and shoot'em up / action oriented, the Cosmatos / Russell effort is inferior to this Kasdan / Costner re-teaming of ""Wyatt Earp"" that needs to be rediscovered by fans of an all american period piece epic film, produced and directed in the old style of the Western tradition...",Wyatt Earp
59,robert-259-28954,Good but overly long.,7,29 April 2012,"The timing of this version of the venerable saga was highly disadvantageous, its release being so very close to ""the other Wyatt Earp,"" Tombstone. That said, it's a completely different movie. While ""Tombstone"" relied on more dramatic license and cinematic bombast, this one was far more historically accurate, right down to the decidedly period dialog. However, it was far too long for most viewers, with a pace that left much to be desired, suffering more from its extended length than any other issue with the film itself. The acting was good, with Costner his typically unemotional self. However, his supporting cast was especially good, particularly in the case of the Earp Women. Dennis Quaid was excellent, in a stunning transformation over his usual roles. Once again, his version will be certainly be compared to the superb Val Kilmer, but once again, in terms of history, one would have to describe it as more accurate. Again, a drastic editing would have made this a far better overall film experience.",Wyatt Earp
60,stevetseitz,Highly under-rated and worthwhile western epic,10,14 April 2003,"As an owner of the Wyatt Earp extended Director's edition I can tell you that I thought the film was neither too long or too slow as some ""attention-span-deficient"" critics have labled it. Admittedly, I have seen shorter movies and movies with more wall to wall action, but I am patient enough to enjoy the slow enveloping experience of a Tarkovsky film. When this film came out, I couldn't convince anyone to see it with me, so I had to go alone. I was blown away by the cast, the performances, the writing and the movie. The cast was terrific. Even bit characters are well-known actors in this film. Gene Hackman was his superb self as Wyatt's stern but loving father. The film didn't skip over significant elements in Wyatt's life like most of the filmed versions do. His transformation from a young adventure-seeking farmer's son to a fearless and feared lawman is believable and compelling. The cinematography was fantastic and was deservedly written up in an issue of American Cinematographer magazine. On a side note, I think this film works well as an allegory to current events. The United States is represented by Wyatt and the ""Wild West"" is the world. Like the U.N., Ed Masterson tries to get Wyatt to become less strict and hard-nosed in the application of law. Ed gets killed because he is ""too affable"". Like France and Russia, the corrupt sheriff Johnny Behan (Mark Harmon) tries to get Wyatt to sell out, because there is ""enough money for everybody"" if he just looks the other way. Wyatt is too rigidly principled for either of these two men but retains his dignity and honor.",Wyatt Earp
61,JohnLeeT,A Masterful Tribute to An American Hero,10,2 August 2014,"Seldom in cinema does a film capture so majestically the Old West and the men who tamed it. Masterfully directed by Lawrence Kasdan and superbly acted by Kevin Costner, this is the finest biography of Wyatt Earp ever placed on celluloid. Many have tried and failed to convey the violent nature of the time period and the supreme challenges faced by those who swore to uphold the law. In this extraordinary motion picture, the era is brought to life so realistically and with such depth that one almost chokes on the trail dust. Costner delivers his most stunning performance and sets the screen ablaze with his portrayal of Earp. It is such powerful work that he dominates the screen and stands astride the landscape that is photographed so beautifully. Dennis Quaid gives a truly overwhelming performance as Doc Holliday and so successfully brings the character to life that he seems to literally becomes him in flesh and blood. As a Western, this is of tremendous scope yet intimate enough that we grow to know the characters as if we were one of them. There is action but also great truth in this story of Earp the Lawman, a complex and determined man of heroic stature. What we witness with this motion picture is true greatness, uncompromising magnificence, and incredible artistry. It is indeed the ultimate tribute to one of the great men in the history of this nation, a man focused on bringing peace and justice to an uncivilized, savage territory. Not only bullets came from the barrel of his Peacemaker. So did the ultimate meaning of Law. He did not only shed blood. He also spread the seeds of what would be a new society. Kasdan has created a lasting tribute to a heroic figure and Costner has given what may well be the performance of his lifetime in bringing Wyatt Earp to the screen in a way that surpasses all that has come before in cinema.",Wyatt Earp
62,jljacobi,Liked it---a lot!,8,22 May 2003,"Okay, okay... I can see why some people might not fall in love with this film. Kevin Costner can do that to you. But I enjoyed this movie and the lead actor tremendously. I liked the sweep of it, the lengthy exposition, as well as the action at the end. Admittedly, I'm a sucker for the subject matter--I enjoyed Tombstone and Kurt Russell as well.All that aside, Dennis Quaid should've won an Oscar for his portrayal of Doc Holliday. In my book, he was brilliant. Any time an actor that recognizable can fool me as to his identity for an entire movie he's done some serious acting.

Some filmmakers will never learn that the truth or a semblance of it can be just as interesting as their imagination. This movie is a historically inacurate tale purporting to be about Earp and is actually nothing more than a plotless, western soap opera with some shootings.

64,KingProjector93,How The West Snored,5,19 December 2014,"From SIlverado director Lawrence Kasdan, this epic western tells the life of the West's most iconic lawman, from naive farm boy, to bandido to marshal, all leading up to, and past, the fight at the O.K Corral.Despite some absolutely gorgeous cinematography, and a lush, sweeping score by James Newton Howard, Kasdan & Costner's biopic is slow and undercooked. With a thin story, which feels like a series of reconstructions strung together with a lack of development or focus, and characters, most of whom solely spew moral speeches, that never get to do much, it just wears on you. In fact, for a film that claims to be the truest telling of Earp's life, the film takes quite a few liberties, and just like other duds like 'Patch Adams', doesn't use them for any real purpose or reason. For the 3 hours+, all you get is characters either belittling Earp or just giving him some overwritten moral lecture, his father (for all the 10 minutes he's on screen) being just a glorified exposition machine, and no real sense of what Earp himself really feels or thinks about all these things. This is not helped by Costner's stone-faced performance, or flairless dialogue that sounds like it was ripped straight from history textbooks without much thought.A shame as some high quality actors (the likes of Quaid as the destructive Doc, Hackman as Earp's father, alongside Pullman and Sizemore among others) are in those roles, in addition to the aforementioned stunning production values, but this lifeless recreation misuses them all grossly. For those who found, say, the likes of 'Gandhi' or 'Kundun' a snooze, 'Wyatt Earp' will put you in a coma.",Wyatt Earp

I do, however, think that Costner was more what I have imagined Earp as than Russell was.  I've always imagined him as somewhat quiet, and less prone to outburst, but what do I know?The plot carried over very well and pulled at your emotions with real gut-wrenching scenes.  The tension between the Earps and the Clantons was very well depicted.  You got the whole picture of what went on in the life of the legendary MarshallKilmer vs. Quaid for Doc Holliday?  Both were effectively symptomatic of tuberculosis, which symptoms mean more to you?  Pale fever and a cold sweat (Kilmer), or just the rapid weight loss (Quaid)?  Also, I don't think anyone can't really determine what kind of demeanor was right for the Doc, so I can't say which of the two actors were more inline there.  Quaid was great and scored big in playing outside himself, but I have to go with Kilmer who managed the same, and consistently stole scenes with his ""cool cat"" portayal.As good an historical epic has ever been done!",Wyatt Earp
66,rcastl2335,Costner and Kasdan come together to make another bad Western,4,12 July 2013,"In the summer of 2013 Wyatt Earp has been showing up regularly on cable. I thought I'd view it again to see if it worked better in my living room than in a multiplex. It does, though just barely. Although this is not the silly, Baby Boomer mess that Silverado was, WE is final proof that Westerns are not in Lawrence Kasdan's area of competence. For Costner, it's another of the bloated vanity projects that crashed his career after multiple Oscars wins for the majestic Dances With Wolves. As I said, it does view better on the small screen; which is small comfort for the viewer. It's too long, it's humorless and it has that grungy, unshaved, unwashed look that hack film makers mistake for ""authenticity."" Costner, at this point in his career, didn't want to share the screen with equals. So he surrounds himself with mainly B-list co-stars, Gene Hackman being the sole exception. Some give good performances: Mark Harmon is a terrifically sleazy Johnny Behan, for example. And Dennis Quaid gives one of the very best portrayals of the legendary Doc Holiday. Unfortunately for him, the absolute best on screen Doc is Val Kilmer in the rival Wyatt Earp film, Tombstone. Still, it may be his finest performance on film. On the other end, the usually gifted Mare Winningham is lost as Earp's mistress, Mattie Blaylock. That Costner let his ego overwhelm the film is, finally, what dooms it. Dominating screen time while dispensing with the warmth, humor and sex appeal of his previous films, his Earp is relentlessly vicious and morbidly sullen throughout. In the end, the best way to watch the film is to wander the house doing chores while running to the TV room only when you hear on screen threats or gunfire.",Wyatt Earp

Maybe it is also because it has been so long since a good Western was on the big screen.Great cast. I know neither film is accurate but I was disappointed that the movie portrays Virgil & Morgan as shot in the same day. I think it was 3 months apart. I think they could have got that right.

It allows the viewer to really feel the times, and understand how the OK Corral deal could have really happened. Previous versions make the shootout seem like something from a dime novel, but knowing it's historically accurate has always kept it in the limelight.If you have the time, and have never rally grasped the atmosphere around the Earps, this version is certainly worth your time.Excellent acting, and directing.",Wyatt Earp
71,stu9003,Excellent - not your typical Western,9,24 January 2002,"I've never been a fan of the Western genre, but I found myself enjoying this one. This is not your typical Hollywood Western. It cuts out pretty much every romantic vision of the American west that Hollywood has ever portrayed and just presents a fascinating bare bones account of one of the frontier's greatest heroes. Rather than focusing totally on the OK Corral, there is an emphasis on the events prior to Tombstone that molded Wyatt Earp.This is one of the few Western movies I've seen where you get a feel for how it actually might have been to live in that time. Instead of the usual Hollywood fluff, you get something much different. There are still scenes with stagecoaches and saloons, but they don't seem as romanticized as in other Westerns. And you also get other non-Hollywood visions of the West, such as scenes with buffalo being slaughtered and skinned.Wyatt Earp himself is portrayed as a very powerful individual who, while fighting on the side of the law, could also be cold-hearted, cruel, and excessively violent at times. Attributes necessary for survival as a lawman.Costner is fantastic as Wyatt Earp, with one minor complaint. He's got the attitude, posture and look down pat. It's just that I think his voice is a bit too nasally to carry the power that Wyatt Earp must have had whenever he spoke. As for the other actors, they are all outstanding with Dennis Quaid in particular turning in a great performance as Doc Halladay.A lot of people have commented on this movie and Tombstone. Personally, I enjoyed both, but the difference is that when I watch Tombstone, I feel like I just watched an entertaining story, whereas when I watch Wyatt Earp I feel like I just saw a piece of history.

One can only guess. - Well, this movie dropped after Tombstone - which took the more entertaining, 'casual route' to the story; leaving this more 'serious tone' work to be ridiculously slow and boring, comparatively. Basically, it never stood a chance. Especially Quaid's Doc Holiday compared to Kilmer's.

Well... the very fact that they didn't get a younger actor in to play out the expository scenes should tell you all that you need to know.This is a Costner vehicle, but he really falls short in this one and the film just looks like showboating.Save yourself the time and watch Tombstone instead...

In Tombstone it tells the story of how the Earps acquired property in Tombstone, there is no mention of his Dodge City days or his employment as a buffalo skinner. There is no Bat Masterson in Tombstone at all In Wyatt Earp Gene Hackman adds considerable weight as Wyatts Father, unfortunately he disappears too soon. Tombstone was made a year before and it is possible that Lawrence Kasdan saw a copy of the script or early cut and decided to change his film to not duplicate Tombstone, why compare the two of them, they are made from the same material, but are from different angles Wyatt Earp in all honesty has more depth, where Tomstone is more stylish, and Wyatt Earp appeals to more low gray matter people, where Tombstone is more sophisticated.I guess if you are going to sit through a 3hr 36min film, that thinking too hard should be optional (***) Out Of (****)",Wyatt Earp

All that hot desert weather and they were in heat absorbing black.The scenes with wives and lovers were tedious and added little to the film.Frankly, any movie this long should be classified as epic, and this one certainly did not fall into that category.

78,johnno-17,the search for adventure - but not the adventure itself,3,20 January 2010,"Beyond contemporary newspaper reports and court testimony, there are two primary sources of information about the central moment of the Earp saga, at least as most people find it interesting, the gunfight at the OK Corral. The first book-length memoir of the event was by Deputy County Sheriff Billy Breckinridge, which painted a very bleak portrait of the Earps as thugs and criminals. This was answered by a book by Josie Marcus, Wyatt's common-law wife. Her book is by far the more credible, as she makes no effort to white-wash or hero-ize the Earps - they come across as complicated men with a complicated ethics. The film that came out shortly before this one, ""Tombstone,"" unabashedly adopts the version of the story Josie presented; there are few media presentations of the Breckrinridge version, the most notorious being the poorly received Stacy Keach film of the early '70s ""Doc."" The interesting thing about ""Wyatt Earp"" is that it tries to avoid either of these perspectives; that's a mistake, because the middle ground is already held by Josie thanks to her honesty; the legend of Earp-as-hero (e.g., ""My Darling Clementine"" or the old Wyatt Earp TV show) is actually derived from word-of mouth folk-tales and dime novels, not based on any experience or record, so if you're going to dispel the myth without accepting the Breckinridge propaganda as the basis of your story, you have to resort to Josie's version, and if then you reject that what you need is some theme to define your focus, otherwise you're just going to cram your story with incidental biographical details that never congeal into a dramatic whole - which is precisely what happens here.This film is a mess - it is literally all over the place. One loses track of all the minor characters we meet in locations all over the West. Incidents are framed as though they portend dramatic implications, which never at last come to light. The dialog also fails to make its impact. Costner's Wyatt certainly comes across as dour and enigmatic, but never as complicated or as ethically complex as he appears to have been in real life.Put bluntly: Wyatt Earp was a Puritan (i.e., Calvinistic) atheist, a precursor to the 20th Century existentialist, who committed himself to action (sometimes very violent) and adventures, not because he loved excitement or discovery, but because there was really nothing else to do that would make life meaningful. The 19th Century literary equivalent would be some sort of synthesis of the obsessed Ahab and the meandering Ishmael of Melville's ""Moby Dick."" Now such a personality could give us a helluva story, even if not completely realized - and while ""Tombstone"" is a fine portrayal of the basic narrative, there's no doubt that it is too 'Hollywood' to capture the real depth of the character in Russell's Performance.But while Kostner seems to understand how deep Earp's personality runs and in what direction, he seems to keep trying to figure him out, as if he could find the key to this enigma that would open the door to the core of Earp's personality. But Despite the greater superficiality of Russell's performance, Russell is actually closer to that key, which is defined as Earp's apparent determination that any such personality core simply doesn't exist and that the proper response to this discovery is to act rather than question.So think of the Kostner Wyatt Earp as an Ahab without a white whale to hunt, an Ishmael without a Pequod to sign onto. Thus the film ""Wyatt Earp"" just wanders around the 'wild West' equivalents of the whaling towns Melville describes in the opening of his novel looking for some thematic purpose to focus on. It never gets there.",Wyatt Earp

While it is interesting to review the early life of Wyatt, it doesn't contribute one thing to the picture that the average movie goer would care to spend time and money on.  The savior of this film is Dennis Quaid, who did a magnificent job as ""Doc"" Holliday.  I will give the film credit, too, for having the guts to reduce Johnny Ringo to the insignificant character that he actually was in real life.

This movie is inferior to Tombstone.We rented this on Blu-ray thinking it would be a masterful classic, one that we would love so much that we would eventually have go out and buy it.It was clear in the first five minutes that the movie was trying way too hard. For example, the score was maddening. Every single sequence (no matter how utterly insignificant) had dramatic orchestral background music over and over and over without a break. You know, a decent movie doesn't need an orchestra constantly playing to keep the viewers attention. This reminded me of the old silent movies where someone played a piano live in the theater throughout the film to help dramatize the silent events on the screen. It did not help this film, trust me.Secondly, you are constantly teased with the end of the movie, only to find out that you have to endure more and more face time with Costner. By the end of the movie you are more or less sick and tired of looking at him.I was sorely disappointed in the Doc Holiday and Kate characters. uninteresting, unlikable, contrived and again, the acting seemed noticeably forced.This movie felt extremely long-winded and more a statement of Costner's ego than an entertaining reproduction of historical importance. It was really hard to sit through this whole thing and all four of us kept laughing about how it should go ahead and end for God's sake.Tombstone, by comparison, was very tight, entertaining and generally interesting with much better acting and vastly more interesting characters.",Wyatt Earp

The sheer pace of this one leaves you breathless. These movies should be seen back to back and not compared as they tell two different stories occurring at the same time and place. Costner as Wyatt was more believable But Russell's Earp was more fun. Quaid was Doc Holiday but Kilmer had a holiday with the role.

83,thrillhouse678,"here's a tip, if your going to comment on this, research the topic",8,17 August 2001,"I just want to say that i will be the first person to step up and defend Kevin Costner. With movies like The Untouchables, Dances With Wolves, and Field of Dreams, this guy has proven himself several times over. Just because someone in Hollywood has the guts to do movies that HE wants to do, regardless of their potential at the box office, we shouldn't slanderize this guy every chance we get. People say Costner has taken a big turn for the worse lately, but i liked Waterworld and most recently, Thirteen Days. I would also like to say that i dont' see any of you people who criticize this guy so much makin movies. With that said i would also like to say that i love Tombstone, and bought it right after i saw it the first time. With two movies coming out about the same true story back to back, and with the first release (Tombstone) being such a big success, comparisons are inevitable. But these movies aren't really based on the exact same events. Tombstone is about, just that, Tombstone and what the Earps did there and immediatly after. Wyatt Earp isn't about the Earps, it's about WYATT EARP, hence the tittle. Aside from that, the movies are totaly different. First of all Tombstone, good as it was, is almost a work of fiction. I loved Kurt Russel and Val Kilmer as the movie's center pieces, Wyatt Earp and Doc Holliday respectively. The fact is however, Russel plays a very emotionally open person. Costner plays him as a quiet, almost cold person. Now, alot of people who have made comments about this movie have criticized Costner for that.(Big surprise.) But, you can't blame Costner for this because Wyatt Earp is not a fictional character, he was a flesh and blood human like you, and most importantly, Costner plays Earp much more realisticly. Then there is the much debated arguement over who plays a better Doc Holliday, Val Kilmer in Tombstone, or Dennis Quaid in Wyatt Earp. Well, here's the thing, if you mean who played Doc closer to reality....then the undisputed winner is Quaid. But if you mean who is more enjoyable, well that's a matter of opinion. But before i move on i got a bone to pick with somebody who said Tombstone was much better because Russel played the kind of Earp that ""we imagine"". Look lady, you can have whatever ridiculous ideas about the way past events took place all you want....but don't ever bring me into your childish little dream world by generalizing your opinions by saying what ""we imagine"". When it comes to this i don't imagine anything, i actually got the facts. Now i don't want to sound like a know-it-all, because i hate those people, but, as i said in my summary, if your going to comment on this movie, research the topic, or at least now the facts. Then this same man or woman who tells me what i imagine poeple as goes on to say she imagines Doc Holliday as a ""sly and witty sort of character the way Kilmer played him"" Well that is fabulous, but the fact is that Doc, who was a witty person was witty in the way Dennis Quaid portrays him. For example in a conflict a drunk Ike Clanton tells Holliday that Holliday's day is comin. Doc responds by saying, ""My mama always said never put off 'til tomorrow the people you can kill today."" Then also in the list of comments for this movie is some total moron who said Quaid is at his worst on this movie. Anybody care what that guy thinks? I didn't think so.

The story of the Wild West is a quintessential American story that exhibits the daring and power of the United States at that time. Pistols and shotguns don't seem like very out of the world to us now. However, back then, they were new and revolutionary inventions that rendered the old musket balls and smoothborn guns obsolete. This change is similar to the invention of jet engines or computers. There is no doubt that early American spirit is that of a settler and pioneer. This frontier life is similar to many other countries and other periods of history. However, the unique invention of portable and easy to use firearms shifts the focus of combat to a more psychological aspect than pure muscle (and muscle memory lol). This is why Doc Holiday, who is sick with turbucolosis can fight side by side with the Earps in the Wild West. Men become tougher, not necessarily in a physical way but particularly in a mental way. This test of nerves and courage is much more influential than the old Roman arena.

87,Mr_Vai,The Intelligent Earp movie,10,11 January 2005,"I grow so angry when I hear people claim that this film was inferior to the rather stupid ""Tombstone."" Costner actually takes the time and effort to make this film realistic and historic in nature. He surrounds himself with great talent and just makes a wonderful film. Being a historian, I was thrilled to see how much of recorded history was in this film. This film is, dare I say, educational. Which is why I guess it has taken a back seat to the Hollywood Kurt Russell film, which is Rambo goes to Arizona. Of course, people will say ""Wyatt Earp bombed, it must be bad."" Well, that is not true. Kevin Costner has made an entertaining and intelligent movie that seeks to tell people the real story about what happened in Tombstone.",Wyatt Earp
88,octagonproplex,"NOT the OTHER movie, but ANOTHER CLASSIC!",9,3 June 2017,"Director Lawrence Kasdan went mythic in scope and breadth with his majestic ode to the great lost American West for ""Wyatt Earp"". It's just full-on romantic sweep, hard-nosed stoicism, and pioneer spirit -- making for one of the most rousing pleasures in the entire genre. An initially overlooked classic, having had the misfortune to arrive under the still looming shadow casts just prior by the similar themed (and also great) ""Tombstone"". The two very different films share old west lawman Wyatt Earp as their main protagonist, but only overlap in depicting the episodes that culminated in the legendary Gunfight at the O.K. Corral -- which occurred in Tombstone's namesake; So naturally that film -- which focuses squarely on the particulars of those specific events -- wins, in rendering fuller aspect to its isolated circumstances.Whereas 1993's ""Tombstone"" was a cracking contained rollicking rampage of a buddy action western, 1994's ""Wyatt Earp"" acted as the saga of a man, a family, and a country -- a lavish production spanning the majority of its titular figure's lifetime.Kevin Costner is every bit as excellent in his own way here portraying Wyatt Earp as Kurt Russell was in his unique fashion for ""Tombstone"". But instead of being as hellbent and primal, Costner goes for quiet simmering dread. He's a peaceful realist haunted by violence, willing to warily adapt to triumph within those means. A harsh man with heart, convicted by the decency dispersed down to him by his disciplined and principled patriarch father, memorably played to perfection in just a few scenes by the always wonderful Gene Hackman. Doc Holiday is not the breakout star in this opus like he was in Val Kilmer's show stealing performance for ""Tombstone"", but rather he shows up maybe half way through and is played very believably and seriously by Dennis Quaid. More amusingly cantankerous in his witty retorts than Kilmer's swaggeringly deft provocateur. I imagine Quaid's less seductive Doc Holiday is honestly more realistic than Kilmer's, although Kilmer wins in entertainment value and greater sense of unpredictable danger. For the Tombstone set portion that occurs in ""Wyatt Earp"", it's really very well done, but admittedly it's mostly bettered in ""Tombstone"" simply because of that film's ability to flesh out just that story over the course of its entire running time. But also, I think the casting is slightly better, or at least flashier, there too -- I mean ""Tombstone"" has Bill Paxton, Sam Elliot, Powers Booth, Michael Biehn, and Stephen Lang just gnawing on the scenery and spitting it out! Although Michael Madson and Linden Ashby are no slouches as Earp bother's Virgil and Morgan, neither is Mark Harmon's local sheriff stooge Behan. One casting the two movies have in common that I find ""Wyatt Earp"" has a resounding superiority over ""Tombstone"" in though, is that of Wyatt's great lasting love Josie; In ""Tombstone"" she is played quite shrill and to my taste unappealing by Dana Delany, whereas Joanna Going here is so very graceful and lithely empowered that one easily imagines Wyatt's old weather-beaten heart's sudden exposure to the supple elements of such a fine specimen of femininity being quite enough to absolutely consume it. What I'm saying is Joanna Going is very pleasant in deed, which is especially good, because Josie plays a more integral role in ""Wyatt Earp"" as well. ""Wyatt Earp"" is so much more expansive than ""Tombstone"" however, and therefore has so many more fantastically casts roles throughout. Besides the aforementioned Gene Hackman, there's Bill Pullman and Tom Siezmore as Ed and Bat Masterson, plus young Ian Bohen is really good as the boyhood Wyatt. Veteran character actor, James Gammon makes a nice appearance. Even Jim Caviezel shows up briefly as the youngest Earp brother. And the Earp wives and women actually hint at some genuine human agency, nicely realized by Mare Winningham, Catherine O'Hara, JoBeth Williams, Alison Elliott, and Betty Buckley. So, an unequivocally great cast.The set design looks wonderful and appears proper in depicting the burgeoning West under construction. The costuming feels authentic, but ""Tombstone"" also felt appropriate and had the added benefit of cutting an indelibly iconic silhouette with Doc and the Earp brothers drapped all in black as near undertakers in those long duster coats and Wyatt's wide flat brimmed hat. Kurt Russell and Sam Elliot also clearly won the mustache war. Not that ""Tombstone"" wasn't a well photographed film in its own right, but oh-my, what wonders do dazzle brilliant in ""Wyatt Earp""! Owen Roizman provides some of the most exhilaratingly lush pastoral scope cinematography you're likely to ever lay your gaze upon, yet then counterpoints that with wonderfully moody chiaroscuro lighting evoking the very best in film noir. It really is about as good as it gets. Yet not to be outdone, composer James Newton Howard goes on ahead and throws his hat in the arena of the very best Western film scores ever. In fact, the differences between these two iconic cinematic Earp offerings can perhaps be best encapsulated in their music scores, with Bruce Broughton composing an equally perfect accompaniment to his picture's less lofty but more rugged ambitions. But ""Wyatt Earp"" is just working on a whole other level, as is its moving score compositions. Although ""Tombstone"" was the breakout box- office hit, both succeeded wonderfully true to their aim. A provocative pulp novella, and a sumptuous sprawling tome; ""Tombstone"" is one terrific juicy burger, and ""Wyatt Earp"" is one magnificent four- course-meal. And just as a delicious entree, movies and music are treats of taste meant to be consumed and enjoyed; they're not subject to monogamous fidelity, and won't become hurt or jealous of time spent or pleasure derived from another!",Wyatt Earp
89,astoryweaver,Never Too long,10,5 May 2003,The long version of Wyatt Earp is preferrable to the quick shoot em up of Tombstone.  We can understand more about Wyatt Earp from boy to man.

Kevin was supposed to do Tombstone but had already commited himself to the Wyatt Earp version.,Wyatt Earp

I'm not much of a Costner fan, but I do love this movie. He is the perfect choice as the stoic lawman who did things that a lot of people, including himself, didn't like, but that had to be done to earn respect from all the crazies in the wild, wild west. As Earp, he delivers two lines in this movie that sum it up.(As County Sheriff tries to arrest Wyatt after the OK Corral incident.)Sheriff: Wyatt! I want to see you. Earp: If you're not careful, you'll see me once too often.And later, when Wyatt is facing down a lynch mob that wants to string up a prisoner.Man in crowd: Who's going to stop us? You??Earp: You're right, I can't stop you. There's enough of you here tonight to overpower me. (Draws his guns) But I'm taking ten or twelve of you with me.

92,drdos43,Wyatt Earp - Quiet Burp,6,19 March 2005,"I just viewed this movie on the History Channel and the commercials were somewhat better than the movie. I couldn't wait for the breaks, but I kept on watching it anyway. That should tell you something. Perhaps I am a glutton for punishment.You cannot rate this film as great, but it is rather interesting and intriguing. Rather than calling it an historical adult western, I would attach to it the description of dark, drawn-out,""Dancing with Wolves"" type of Western. I will not say, as others have, that the film is boring. It can only be boring if you haven't had enough sleep. The film has much going for it, i.e., good acting (esp. Dennis Quaid as Doc Holiday), action, excellent photography, and philosophical dialog...probably too much of the latter.The one memorable moment, that I can recall, is when young Wyatt (with his companion riding ""shotgun"", is driving a wagon at break-neck speed, trying to outrun a band of outlaws. As in real life, it is almost impossible to shoot a man off a galloping horse from a moving wagon, unless you happen to be an Annie Oakley. Wyatt, shouts to his companion something to the effect, ""For crying out loud, shoot the lead horse. You can shoot a horse, can't you!"" He does shoot the horse, and the chase abruptly ends. Think of all those old movies where the wagon or stage coach goes over the cliff when all you had to do was shoot the outlaws' horses...easy targets.At any rate, all that was going through my mind during this entire movie was the the theme song from the 1950's Wyatt Earp TV series starring Hugh Obrien:Wyatt Earp, Wyatt Earp,Brave courageous and bold...Long live his name and long live his gloryAnd long may his story be told.Marvin Cohn",Wyatt Earp

Wyatt and his brothers are shown in the varying facets of their humanity, as are their women. Wyatt's early life is shown, which sets the inner core of his adult personality.

Costner's performance as the law man is superb.  Through the innocence of youth to a moody old man, he fits the role perfectly and proves he is better than Kurt Russell's Earp in 'Tombstone'. The shoot-outs are superb and there is fantastic support from Dennis Quaid as the ill Doc Holliday, as well as Michael Madsen, Tom Sizemore and Bill Pullman.

Good lord, I'm reading people saying there needed to be more detail, blah blah--you'd need to make a series on TV! It's already, what, three hours long? Some of the acting seemed a little stiff, what is it with Kostner that he always comes off like he's got his lines memorized, and he's trying to remember them? As for passing judgement on historical accuracy--folks, it's a movie, OK? Not a history course. Omission is not historical inaccuracy, it's expediency, as long as the continuity of the story is intact. I liked Tombstone too. Both entertaining movies, neither is Gone With the Wind.

97,wbg02,ambitious but not very good,6,28 July 2003,"I admire the fact that ""Wyatt Earp"" tries to give the viewer a more comprehensive look at the legendary lawman, however ""Wyatt Earp"" falls short as a movie.  It was worthwhile to show Earp's early brush with the law and his early career as a lawman in Dodge.  Unfortunately, most of the events were presented in such a slow, laid back style that rarely the story achieved dramatic tension.  This laconic style seems to have muted the vibrancy of the acting performances.  There are many good actors in this movie like Michael Madsen and Tom Sizemore yet only Dennis Quaid's Doc Holliday was memorable.  Long movies need to have a big payoff at the end. ""Wyatt Earp"" unfortunately just fizzled after the famous gunfight in Tombstone and the murder that causes Earp's ride for vengeance.  As a more complete picture of the legendary Old West figure, this is worth a viewing, but someone looking for a dramatic, entertaining movie see ""Tombstone"" instead.",Wyatt Earp
98,powersx2,Far Better Than Tombstone,9,3 December 2007,"I will say that I saw this film before I saw Tombstone but I have to say, upon further review, this is so far the superior film it's not even funny. It's been 14 years now since these were put out and the more I watch them, the wider the gap between the two films becomes. Quaid is a far superior Doc Holliday. Costner, a far superior Earp. The biggest difference though is in the writing. So many of the lines in Tombstone come across as corny and contrived. They are, for lack of a better term, ""goofy."" Wyatt Earp the film is the grandiose and much more realistic-seeming film. The characters are better developed and the writing is clearly more polished. I don't particularly like either of the Morgan Earp characters in either film, but Virgil Earp again is portrayed much better in Wyatt Earp than Tombstone's Sam Elliott, who basically does his usual and plays Sam Elliott rather than a character. At the end of the day, I've sat through Wyatt Earp about eight times. I've watched Tombstone twice and I've decided there won't be a third. It doesn't stand the test of time at all. Earp does.",Wyatt Earp
99,Rocking DH,Reassessing an underrated masterpiece.,10,19 February 2004,"I have to thank Kevin Costner for taking me West.  ""Wyatt Earp"" led me to pick up a copy of the early Earp bio by Stuart Lake while working in Canada, and I was surprised to find photos of the actual historical people tipped inside.  The resemblance of the actors to those they portrayed impressed me.
I continued to research.  I went to Tombstone and stayed at a nearby ranch. The town itself declined Costner's office to rebuild it with accuracy, preferring the leave things as they are (very touristy).  The gunfight was actually held in the street, etc.  My research matched at least striking physical/type casting for 17 characters, from major characters (the Earps and their wives/women) to the Cowboys, Beehan, Doc Holiday, his Kate, and Bat Masterson.  Linden Ashby is the most striking doppelganger; indeed, he seems to be a physical reincarnation of Morgan Earp. Dennis Quaid lost some 40 pounds or so for the role of Doc Holiday and his resemblance to the TB-plagued gambler from Valdosta, Georgia is eerie as well.
Costner caught a lot of flack for this film; in fact, few critics noted the historical sense that he achieved.  Granted, some cuts are made in time frame/continuity to speed plot along (i.e. timing of attacks on Morgan and Virgil), and the film is lengthy.  I learned that the Cowboy/Earp feud was not mere ill-will, but that the strife represented political differences and clashing economic interests, as well as the ""theft"" of a lover.  The old diaries and biographies are fascinating!  I learned that Morgan Earp told Allie Earp something like, ""I want to leave Tombstone and never come back"" moments before he was shot to death.Of note, Johnny Beehan's partner in the Dexter Corral in Tombstone was a man named ""John Dunbar"".  This was Costner's character's name in ""Dances with Wolves"".  Go figure. Read more about it!  Granted Lake embellished Earp's image, but the place, the times and the issues are fascinating.",Wyatt Earp
100,felicity_gr,One of the most boring movies I've ever seen; avoid at all costs,3,5 July 2017,"I'm writing here starting with a clean slate: I watched the film without knowing who Wyatt Earp was, or that there was another film (Tombstone) about the same guy, which everyone has been comparing Wyatt Earp to. So, I'm not prejudiced and I'm not gonna make comparisons. It was just a boring film, with a nonsensical script that dragged on and on unnecessarily, occasionally introduced new characters who didn't have any meaningful contribution to the plot, and little to no sense of adventure and excitement. But the most annoying thing in the movie, I have to admit, is Kevin Costner himself. It seems that Mr Costner has a knack for playing the same character in every movie he stars in: a brooding, smile-less, miserable, cold-outside- but-with-a-heart-of- gold tough macho guy. Well, not such a good guy here, in my opinion. Just a cold-hearted bastard, as one of the characters calls him. But I digress. So, if the film wasn't unbearable enough, Costner's performance makes it even worse. Towards the end I had to fast- forward; I didn't miss anything important, and you wouldn't either, believe you me.",Wyatt Earp

Dennis Quaid is exactly right for Doc Holliday. The way the movie takes its good old sweet time to tell about the man himself is what I like. I enjoy the long, leisurely version. I like knowing the details of Wyatt Earp's courtship with Urilla, her tragic dying while pregnant with their child, his troubles with the law, and his next encounter with the other women in his life. I love the soundtrack to this epic tale. It's catchy and you find yourself humming along with it. I think the cinematography in this picture is some of the best ever. Each real-life personality was perfectly cast. Lawrence Kasdan did an outstanding job along with all involved. I truly wish this had been a front runner in the Oscars. Had it been more appreciated, it would've took top honors, I'm sure. I think it's sad that this movie was so ignored by critics and viewers alike.

What marks this movie is that it is the most accurate depiction of what transpired in the life of Wyatt Earp. Lawrence Kasdan, the director, did an excellent job in making sure that the film was almost true to life. The cinematography of the movie was top-notch. The first half of the movie is pure Western magic, which had me in awe. The second half of the movie, however, while still highly accurate, was not all that interesting. Overall, the movie did an excellent job in portraying Wyatt Earp the man, not the legend. The acting was pretty good. Kevin Costner portrayed Wyatt Earp, and his display of Wyatt's transformation was effective, although I felt that he was a little too wooden in the second half of the movie. Dennis Quaid gave a lot for this movie; he lost 42 pounds to play the role of Doc Holliday. His portrayal of Doc will be drawing comparisons with Val Kilmer's portrayal in Tombstone for years to come. I recommend this movie, but I give a warning.

110,burn4580,More historically accurate than 'Tombstone',9,12 September 2017,"Having watched both movies again recently and reading other reviews, I felt compelled to write my own review. I enjoyed both movies, but having researched Wyatt Earp and the Tombstone era, it seems that 'Tombstone' is not as accurate as 'Wyatt Earp.' Yes, 'Wyatt Earp' is quite long, but it does give a lot more background about Earp. It's funny, people in reviews rant about the length of the movie, but then talk about things it left out. The real Wyatt Earp had such a complicated life, that no two or three our movie could possibly cover it all and have it make sense. First, while I like Kurt Russell in 'Tombstone', I thought that his portrayal was too soft, overall. The Earps had a reputation for bullying people, which I thought Kevin Costner played better in 'Wyatt Earp.' 'Tombstone' has Wyatt Earp resisting to be a lawman again until just before the infamous shootout, when, in fact, he was one form of lawman or another the entire time he was in Tombstone, which ""Wyatt Earp' covers better. 'Tombstone' makes no mention whatsoever about brothers James and Warren, when, in fact, James was in Tombstone at the time of the shootout, but didn't take part because of his useless arm, an injury from the war (which they covered by the way). Warren took part in the posse vendetta, which 'Tombstone' did not cover. 'Wyatt Earp' mentioned or showed actual places like the Cosmopoliton, where the Earps stayed after the shootout, Fly's Photography and Boarding House, the Oriental Saloon and Hatch's Pool Hall, where Morgan was killed. Yes, there are inaccuracies as well. Virgil and Morgan were not shot on the same night. Virgil was first and three months later, Morgan. 'Tombstone' did the same thing, only worse. They'd had you believe that Virgil was shot and Morgan became so enraged that he went to play pool, then got shot himself and that Wyatt wasn't there. 'Wyatt Earp' shows that Wyatt was in the pool hall with Morgan and a bullet hit the wall next to him, which is what really happened. The only problem I have with the shootout in 'Wyatt Earp' is that Doc Holliday didn't fire his shotgun until the end, when most accounts say he fired it first, killing Tom McClaury. Most accounts say that just before any shots, a double click was heard, which most attribute to Doc cocking the shotgun. 'Tombstone' doesn't show Doc as being shot, but he was, which is shown in 'Wyatt Earp.' Later, when Stilwell was found shot at the railroad terminal, he had numerous bullet wounds, including a shotgun blast, which 'Wyatt Earp' depicts. I like Dennis Quaid's portrayal of Doc Holliday better than Val Kilmer's, although both were good. I liked Quaid's Georgia accent much better. By the way, both movies say Doc died in a sanitarium, which is not true. He died in his bed in the Glenwood Hotel. However, 'Tombstone' does show what Doc supposedly said just before he died while looking at his feet, ""This is funny!"" However, they don't indicate what he meant which was, he'd always thought he'd die with his boots on, not in his bare feet. Wyatt Earp did not learn of Doc's death for several months and was not with him just before he died as portrayed in 'Tombstone.' To me, 'Tombstone' does more accurately depict the shootout with Curly Bill and his bunch than 'Wyatt Earp' does. Neither film covers the shooting of Marshall White accurately according to statements (even by Earp himself). Both movies treat the shooting as intentional, which, I guess it could have been, but the movies leave no room for doubt. To sum up, I believe 'Wyatt Earp' to be more factual than 'Tombstone.' However, both movies take the usual Hollywood liberties to make the movie more enjoyable and watchable. It you want a totally accurate account, I suggest you find a good documentary about Wyatt Earp or find a good history book. Not many movies about real people are ever true-to-form.",Wyatt Earp

115,dhayner,Much better than Critics Said,8,31 October 1999,"I really liked this film.  Kevin Costner and, for that matter, the whole cast was outstanding. Dennis Quaid was exceptional and surely deserved more recognition from the critics than he received. My objections to the film must be laid at the door of Kasdan...it could have been edited with a sharper hand. I under-stand the desire to expand the story to it's fullest but many minutes could have been cut during the manhunt at the railway station and the end scenes done in retrospect weren't necessary. More careful editing might have saved the day on a fine film.",Wyatt Earp
116,DES1988,Yet another Costner vision that leaves a lasting impression....,10,23 January 2020,"I could write a 10,000 word essay on this movie. I enjoyed every minute of this film and Costner always delivers in his Western's.I really enjoyed this movie as it wasn't meant to be a Hollywood drama with constant shootouts and drinking and carrying on. It is meant to be a character study on the entire life of Wyatt Earp. It fittingly starts when Wyatt was a young kid on his family farm. The film briefly touches on Wyatt's dad's influence on his life, more specifically on the importance of the law. His dad was constantly preaching to his children that after family, the law is about the only thing you can count on. As Wyatt reaches his young adult years, he goes through life lessons that will test him. After a few struggles he will eventually settle into a career that will make him one of the most respected and legendary lawmen the US has ever seen.If you are looking for a Tombstone style Western movie this is not it. I consider this film similar to Dances With Wolves in that it is a visionary movie that pays close attention to detail. Although the pace is slower, I consider that one of the greatest strengths of this film. The Western way of life isn't fast paced and I think Costner did an amazing job making you feel what life was really like in the late 1800's. He didn't embellish (for the most part) Wyatt's life. He didn't embellish the ""Wild West."" He didn't embellish the shootouts. Instead he gave us a stunning vision on Western life during this time.I highly recommend this move to anyone who appreciates character studies, visuals, cinematography and historical accuracy. Costner nailed this film and although some people prefer more shootouts and action, I think it is a breath of fresh air to see an accurate Western movie without the 6 shooters flying constantly.",Wyatt Earp
117,moewadle,Most historically accurate of all the films about Earp/Tombstone,8,24 January 2013,"I agree with the review by Senator__Noc I think it is who states it is the most historically accurate and that Costner plays Earp like Earp was. I agree with the first part of that, it is the most historically accurate because of my readings about Earp and Tombstone, Arizona. You may like the film TOMBSTONE better than the film, Wyatt Earp, but this one is the most accurate. However, why not just see both of them and enjoy them for what they are.Some examples of historic accuracy: How gunfight was shown...just before it you see Morgan Earp and DoC walking together and one says to the other, ""Let's get'em."" This is straight out of a history quoting an eyewitness who heard that remark. Also, Wyatt's relationships with women. He was married to Aurelia in Missouri and she died. He did have a relationship with Mattie Blaylock and he did meet Josephine Marcus and they hooked up in Tombstone after Josephine had a relationship with John Behan. And John flashing a partially nude photo of Josephine is something that is written about in one history. I could go further but that is enough considering all the other reviews.",Wyatt Earp

Then about a year later, I went to a second-run theater and practically fell asleep watching Kasdan's Wyatt Earp. Here it is 2013 and the film is almost 20 years old. Thank goodness I decided to give it another look. It had me from the first scene with Costner alone in the saloon smoking a cigar and sipping coffee before the OK coral fight. I recommend giving this film another look if you saw it on the heels of Tombstone back in 94. It is the far superior movie.

How could so many great actors (not Costner who is the consummate bad actor- the Ryan O'Neal of our time) deliver such putrid performances? Apparently members of the cast were vying to play characters who would get killed early on in the movie, just so by comparison, their lifeless bodies would give a better performance than those actors forced to play characters who were alive. And Costner as a teenage Earp? He sounded like Marty McFly's kid with that horrible forced squeak in his voice. Lawrence Kasdan- how could you allow your name on this POS? Don't even mention the film Tombstone in the same sentence. By comparison, Tombstone is Casablanca, Gone With the Wind and Citizen Kane rolled into one. Costner's Wyatt Earp is the George W.

I have to say though after viewing Wyatt Earp I believe it to be the best western film I have ever seen.The scenery and the people seem authentic and the acting is solid. Even the outlaws in the movie have a sense of humanity and rationality. I believe they portrayed the time and setting very effectively.The story is about love and life, opportunities and most of all family. A rewarding film to watch if you have the time. I had to pause it and go for lunch but while eating I was intrigued to know what was going to happen next. Costner really plays his part well and does not have to carry the film as other actors also pull their weight and characterize well.Well worth a watch people.",Wyatt Earp

Seeing the film has prompted me to explore some of the legends of the Wild West, legends which permeated my childhood growing up in a just post-war England. Far better than 'Tombstone', but I've yet to catch any of the earlier films based around the legendary gunfight at the OK Corral. Dennis Quaid was superb as 'Doc'Holliday - so good as to be almost unrecognisable. He must have lost a lot of weight to get the role, so what's the secret Dennis?

125,osiyo1954,Will the real Wyatt Earp please stand up?,10,16 September 2005,"This is an excellent movie with fine direction by Lawrence Kasdan and fine acting ,good score, and great visuals. I am somewhat of a history buff, so I usually look for some degree of accuracy in movies about historical figures. This film did not disappoint me in that regard.For those who would compare Tombstone to this film, I say they are two completely different stories, as is obvious from their titles! Tombstone is the story of the shootout in Tombstone, with most of the action and plot development centering around those few seconds in history. It is an enjoyable and entirely watchable movie, but is more about how good Kurt Russell,Val Kilmer, and Sam Elliot look in those long black coats and black pants.It is a Hollywood version, portraying Wyatt Earp as what we would like our heroes to be.Kevin Costner's Wyatt Earp on the other hand is a movie about exactly what it purports to be--the life and character of the man. It tells his whole story until 17 years after the events at the OK Corral. And I have to say it is a very good characterization. I really liked that besides being MUCH more historically correct than Tombstone, Costner's Earp was a flawed hero--if even a hero at all. The incidents in Earp's early life that were less than heroic, and in fact downright illegal were related without varnish. It was made clear to me in this film that Earp was a shady character and a rough customer in many ways--not a larger-than-life good guy.The film even portrayed the fact (well-documented in history) that his sister-in-law and others in the family thought Wyatt could be an arrogant, cold bastard sometimes! The genesis of the love affair between Josie Marcus and Wyatt Earp was told in a much more realistic and much less romantic light. They cheated--she on John Behan, he on the woman he had considered his wife. Even the possibility that the historical portrait of Earp's common-law wife Mattie as a pathetic dope-fiend arose after the fact, to let Earp and his lover off the hook, and to foster the good guy myth, is touched on in this version.I did not watch this movie in the theater, and might have found the length a little hard to bear in that setting, but on DVD, I had no problem remaining riveted to the story as it unfolded. It is an epic version of the important events in Earp's life that shaped the man, and should not be confused or compared with other movies (no matter how great!) that center on 15 seconds in history.Tombstone vs. Wyatt Earp---why not watch them both? Just don't simplistically expect the same things from them, as clearly stated by the titles, they are two different stories.",Wyatt Earp

There are always reenactments of the OK Corral going on but when it's a special occasion the best actors in town do the job. It was fantastic! In leaving that area, and after talking to a local historian, I bought Wyatt Earp on CD. I was recommended because of its historical accuracy. Contrary to other reviews, my opinion is that Costner, Quaid, Madson, and company couldn't have been better. I looked for nominations for any of them and found only Razzies.

""Wyatt Earp"" is superbly written and directed, a sweeping musical score, dynamic acting and character development.  Unlike Kurt Russell's version, ""Tombstone"", Costner's ""Wyatt Earp"" is an intimate tale of a family's tragedy on the American frontier.  Like the story of King Arthur, ""Wyatt Earp"" has that sense of ending from the very beginning of the film, a loss of innocence and the end of a utopian dream.""Tombstone"", the film most often compared with ""Wyatt Earp"", is, to me, a two-dimensional, almost comic book illustration of this man's life. Costner's film allows me to understand Earp and the people around him, to feel their frustrations, their victories, their losses, their humanity. Watching ""Wyatt Earp"", I feel as if I know these people.  And their story leaves me breathless.",Wyatt Earp
129,rrankin,As Close to the Truth as it Gets,10,4 October 2000,"The movie Tombstone, while very action packed, is nothing more than a ""cartoon"" depiction of the story of Wyatt Earp. The Costner/Kasdan movie is far more ambitious. This movie's focus was on the man Wyatt Earp and how he became a legend, and not about the legend of Wyatt Earp. Kasdan did a tremendous job of researching and understanding what made Wyatt tick and his efforts truly pay off in this film. As for Costner, you get the sense that he thoroughly understood what Kasdan was trying to portray and that he himself had a firm grasp of the life of Wyatt. No, he does not have the growl in his voice that Russell has...but that's a plus. Costner is able to get his point across with a simple statement and subtle look. Wyatt was a complex person, not a ""Rambo"" type ""character"". Costner portrays Wyatt with a style that shows emotion without having to say a word (i.e. See the scene where Morgan is shot and Wyatt is backing away from the pool table) as Wyatt was a man of few words. As for Dennis Quaid, his portrayal might be the biggest oversight in history!!! He definitely should have won an Oscar, and NO ONE should ever even mention Kilmer's Holliday again unless as a second fiddle to Quaid's. The rest of the cast was solid with no REAL standouts.As for historical accuracy, there has NEVER been an Earp movie that got it as close to the way it happened than this one! Look it up!!!

Now it's Winter, and I'm bored so I checked it out from my local library and decided to spend a snowy Sunday afternoon watching it. It was actually much better than I expected. Awfully long - I think the length could have been edited down. And to me it was a totally different perspective than Tombstone to the point that at times it was like two totally different stories. But I liked seeing the story of Wyatt and his first wife. I also liked seeing more about the relationships of the Earp brothers and their wives and their relationships with one another. I'm still not sure about going into so much detail about Josie and Wyatt - I kind of like the subtlety of how it is handled in Tombstone. I had difficulty keeping the bad guys straight - Tombstone delves deeper into each one of them. But I enjoyed watching it - a good way to spend an afternoon. I'd recommend taking a look!",Wyatt Earp

Russell was far too goodie goodie in this role while we actually see some character development in Costner's version. As far as Doc Holliday goes I enjoyed both preformances from Dennis Quaid and Val Kilmer (Tomestone).So It basically comes down to the details, If you want acurate details and a more rounded story see Wyatt Earp.If you want fun Hollywood fluff go see Tomestone.",Wyatt Earp

135,dac287,The Historical Wyatt Earp,10,11 January 2005,"There have been many Hollywood films on the shootout at the OK and the Frontier Marshall known as Wyatt Earp. This is one of the better ones. Yes, this one goes up with the other classics made on the subject, My Darling Clementine and Tombstone. What makes this movie so great is not the cheesy western ""clasciness"" of John Ford's early masterpiece, My Darling Clementine, nor the sweaty intensity of the bloody ""Shoot 'Em Up!"" entertainment that is Tombstone. This is the ""history version"" or as historical as Hollywood will ever get.This movie has been called ""boring,"" and it is due for a good 10-15 minute trim (with already a 3 hr. and 10 min. running time!) however this is an epic and not your typical action western. It is a dark biopic that explores the life of Wyatt Earp, and despite having a few slow patches this is a success. The last true epic western, this film details the life of how the west was settled through Wyatt Earp's eyes, as Kasdan tries to make his own take on ""How the West Was Won."" As we see the ever changing west, we see a young boy go from happy husband to widower, to horse thief, to buffalo hunter/skinner, to gambler and eventually lawman. Costner gives another great performance (his last in fact) as the cold Wyatt Earp. While not as flamboyant or ""showy"" as Kurt Russel, he was not trying to be. Instead Costner captures a repressed love and anger that he hides under a deep exterior that reminds one of Henry Fonda (another great Earp).Costner brings this legendary lawman to life and believe me, is fairly accurate (even if they desensitize him a little more for dramatic effect). Along the way on his life journey we meet a large and great array of characters and character actors, including Gene Hackman as Father Earp, Michael Madsaon as Virgil Earp, Linden Ashby as Morgan Earp, Tom Sizemore and Bill Pullman as the Masterson brothers, etc.However, the supporting character who steals the show is Dennis Quaid in a performance of a lifetime as Doc Holliday. Despite being about 15 minutes too long, you can't help but want more of Quaid's Holliday. AFter losing an astounding 43 pounds for the part, he accurately brings the dying and cynical gambler/drunkard/killer/good friend to life. Though once again not as flamboyant as Val Kilmer (a fan favorite) he was not supposed to be. He is instead a much more realistic (still every bit as sardonic and ironic) and much sicker looking Doc. Though not flashy he tells you insights into a deeper character that other films have done less with (even with more screen time for this character).And that sums up Wyatt Earp. It is a large biopic that is about 85% accurate on the life of an interesting man. He isn't the greatest man or hero and it isn't good vs evil (though there is good and evil in this movie) but the dark dramas that befall a man obsessed with family. With a stellar cast Lawerence Kasdan crafts a very good western epic (though flawed). Do not go in expecting the fun lighthearted action of the more ""entertaining"" Tombstone. This is a drama closer to John Ford or How the West Was Won than the Spegehtti westerns that inspired Tombstone. This is a good movie and if you go in expecting a violent and fascinating biography and drama about one man's life, I promise you'll like it.",Wyatt Earp

First, half of the characters are miscast, which leads to deadpan acting and terrible line dialogue and even worse oneliners. Second, the scenes feel sped up and choppy,with forced acting. Third, character development is awful. I understand this is a movie about Wyatt Earp, but the only development is Waytts character and some of Doc.

The film's competitor, Tombstone, on the other hand looks at the events between 1881 and 1884, in particular the events surrounding the gunfight at the O.K. Corral, and isn't that something we've seen in a western many times before? Wyatt Earp gives you much more, it is inevitable that the two would be compared, but people must realise that the emphasis of the two films is very different, this film feels much more contemporary than does Tombstone.

It's too bad this movie was not released BEFORE ""Tombstone"" as it would have set up the audience for ""Tombstone"". Randy Quaid is right-on as Doc, not overdoing the southern accent, and Gene Hackman is terrific as always. Costner is at his best which is great, reminiscent of Gary Cooper.

142,HistoricallyAccurate68,"Entertaining at times, but couldn't be more inaccurate",3,27 March 2011,"Like Tombstone and every other movie ever made about Wyatt Earp and the OK Corral shootout, this movie is basically made up fiction. I simply can't understand why someone doesn't just make a movie about this incident and this man's life based on what really happened. It's MUCH more exciting than this silly movie attempted to portray.First, there are too many historical/factual inaccuracies as well as geographical ones. I'm sure it's expensive to film a movie in the exact location or to move the sets around the country to accurately portray the locations. However, showing mountains in the background in Kansas, Illinois or Iowa is just silly. Either make the movie in the right place or make sure the camera isn't focusing on a mountain range behind a corn field where it couldn't possibly exist.The guns used at the beginning of the movie are not from the correct time period, nor are the holsters. How can simple things like that be overlooked? Why not just show them shooting Uzis or Glocks? Sheriff White was shown as an old man in Tombstone in 1881. In Tombstone, the actor (Harry Caray, Jr.) was even older. However, when Fred White was shot and killed by Curly Bill Brocius, he was only 31. These things can be found in the very available census records from 1880. There is simply no excuse to have people so incorrectly aged. Even Wyatt was only 32 in 1881. Kevin Costner could no more pass for 32 in that movie than having Sam Elliott play Virgil Earp in Tombstone, who was only 36 at the time! The shootout occurred on 10/26/1881. In the movie, Virgil and Morgan were shot on the same night and apparently right after the shootout. However, Virgil was actually shot (and in the left arm, not the right) in December of 1881. Morgan was shot and killed in March of 1882...almost five months after the OK Corral shootout and three months after Virgil. Why couldn't they show those simple things correctly? Just stupid! Josie was living with John Behan and even was taking care of his son. The story of her interaction between John Behan and Wyatt was disjointed and didn't make much sense. Instead of spending so much time on Wyatt's childhood, the movie (in my humble opinion) should have focused on his adulthood and taken the time to be at lease somewhat accurate.Why not show the Bat Masterson was in Tombstone too with the Earps and Holliday? Seems like that would have made sense.Anyway, this movie is only loosely based on reality and should be watched and enjoyed accordingly. To watch and think this is how it really happened is a joke. To read a good book about how things actually went, including the subsequent trial that is almost nonexistent in the movie, read ""Murder in Tombstone"" by Steven Lubet!",Wyatt Earp

During this time, his love life never stopped, and he also met his best friend. At last, he worked with his friend did the famous ""Duel at the farm"".This was such a long movie. It looks like a western movie, but I think it's a biography. In this movie the plot is complete, it's tell the whole story about Wyatt Earp. What's happened to him and why he become like that. It also talks about family, love, friend in this movie, but nothing can stop him becoming a hero. I think this is the feature of the movies about frontier. It's a typical movie about frontier culture. Wyatt Earp is the most important person in this movie. He has the typical characteristic of a hero. He can save people by himself. He always alone. He doesn't have a lot friends but the friend he has is the real friend. He never be selfish. Whatever family and love are not the things he cares about. My personal point, I really like the music in this movie, but for me the movie is too long to finish. Maybe it's a little boring for girls, but I believe that this movie must be the one of the most greatest western movie and it also could be the classic movie of western movie fans.",Wyatt Earp
144,JONATHAN-DRAKE,calm and thoughtful,8,16 January 2004,"A calm and thoughtful exercise... perhaps Costner's best performance as he evolves from a happy-go-lucky youth into a hardened and embittered man. Featuring solid supporting performances (including an excellent Dennis Quaid as Doc Holliday), this is a serious film with few hollywood style bells and whistles. The pacing is slow but steady - Kasden obviously spent more energy on tone and content than he did on thrills for the popcorn crowd. Those who find this one too slow should go rent Tombstone and not bother us anymore.",Wyatt Earp
145,Shadow14US,Insight to the Old West,10,19 March 2005,"Wyatt Earp, has to truly be one of the finest portrayal of a great western hero. I live in the Southwest and here you are closer to the things that took place not that long ago.Wyatt Earp brings to the screen, an insight to each of us just a small understanding of what took place not all that long ago. The west was the last frontier of man, a place where man lived and died by the gun, where law was ruled by the Colt 45.The Gunfight at the OK Corral is one of the last great events that took place in the Old West. The movie brings not only the story of the life and times of Wyatt Earp, but also in showing you the events that led up to the beginning of the end of the Wild West.Any Wild West history buff will enjoy watching and understanding how the puzzle of the Old West fits into becoming a building block of our great nation.This movie will remain as one of my best loved movies.",Wyatt Earp
146,more_tones,A very misunderstood and under-appreciated film,10,2 July 2004,"""Nothing counts more than blood... the rest are just strangers,"" speaks Wyatt's father at the beginning of the film--the most important line perhaps in the movie, with the exception of Wyatt's own at the end ""Some say it didn't happen that way,"" commenting upon a flashback recounting his brand of law and justice in the wild cattle town of Dodge City.I wholeheartedly admit the film is long--but so are many other great films. I also admit that it is not the shoot 'em up Tombstone is, but this film is a far greater one, a character study of a man whose innocence is laid to rest by the harsh wilderness of both the American West and human nature. By the end of this movie, Wyatt is a used up and bitter man, and I would argue that this film was never meant to be a heroic portrayal of an individual, only a dark and complicated one. It reminds me thus of the greatest of character portrayals, Raging Bull--though I'm sure the parallel isn't obvious. I probably am more forgiving of this film since I like Westerns, dark dramatic stories, and admittedly uneven plots, because the characters usually are so great in them. This one is no different, and was likely made for a viewer like me, and not the mainstream audience.It's very ambitious, and successful, I believe, on its artistic merits. Whether it's ""entertainment"" for the masses, well that's another story altogether, and that story's name is probably ""Tombstone.""",Wyatt Earp
147,mxmwc312,Should have had more Doc,6,14 July 2004,"I think that on the whole the movie was good; however, in my opinion Tombstone was better. Wyatt Earp rushed through a lot of seemingly important events, and REALLY dragged on some other parts. Wyatt's sudden lawlessness after the death of his first wife could have been looked into more, as well as his courtship and marriage of Urilla. Dennis Quaid's portrayal of Doc Holiday was great (I love Dennis Quaid and Doc Holiday's my hero) and I think that the movie didn't really do Doc justice. Kevin Costner's performance was mundane sometimes. I don't think that he really, and I know that this is excruciatingly cliché, ""brought the character to life"" the way that the other actors did.",Wyatt Earp
148,istrice01,Why compare Wyatt Earp to Tombstone?,10,28 May 2005,"First of all, I would like to know why so many people are comparing Wyatt Earp to Tombstone. Yes...both films were made within a year apart, but their objectives are completely different. The titles pretty much say it. Tombstone is about the events that transpired in Tombstone...Wyatt Earp is about the man Wyatt Earp. Therefore, they do not have the same goal in mind and are telling two very different stories. I enjoyed both films for different reasons and allow them to stand on their own merits. Tombstone was more entertaining and action-packed, however, the story was not as historically accurate and the characters were a little over the top. Whereas Wyatt Earp had more of a personal, in-depth examination of the life, but not the legend, of Wyatt Earp.Now, lets get to the intention of this film. Wyatt Earp is suppose to be a story about the lawman, with the convictions and tribulations that shape him as a young boy up to old age. Unlike, Tombstone, which focuses on an array of characters with the plot leading up to a single event, quite historically incorrect, I might add. Yes...Wyatt Earp is cold, unforgiving, bitter, reserved, etc. However, he was not always that way, as his early life traveling with his family to California and marriage to Urella Sutherland, a woman he deeply loved, demonstrates. The turning point in the story is when Wyatt's beloved wife dies along with their unborn child. Wyatt lashes out and loses all reason to live. He becomes extremely self-destructive and sets about roaming the West with no real purpose at all except to die. His father slaps some sense into him and tells him to move on with his life. Eventually, he becomes a lawman and that is when we meet the mysterious and quiet Wyatt Earp that nobody likes. So...okay...Wyatt becomes reserved, quiet, and cruel, but it is not as if we do not know why. He was a man trying to survive in a harsh, brutal land and being a lawman did not make it any easier because he was always a target. He was plagued by external demons as well as internal demons, such as the bottle and a strong yearning, undying love for his dead wife. He was very human and this movie manifests that. Tombstone is fine for those of you that do not care for Wyatt Earp beyond the infamous fight at the OK Carroll or the lawman legend. However, if you can stand a more accurate, in depth character exploration of Wyatt Earp, without any pretensions, than this is a movie worth seeing.",Wyatt Earp

150,waterlevel20032003,Not just about the OK Corrall,8,28 November 2005,"A lengthy biopic about Wyatt Earp, this splendid film tackles the problem of telling the story of an actual man's life, and does it well.People do not live like Hollywood films in that our lives have no plot. Wyatt Earp does have a plot, but it is not the glamorous rocket ride of an action film. We get to see Wyatt Earp not so much as a hero, but as a man. He had virtues. But he had flaws and shortcomings, and they led to pain for himself and others.Earp's life was not limited to his time in Tombstone and the movie reflects that. He was around for quite some time before and after that famous gunfight at the OK Corrall. The makers of this movie appreciate that. And though today we associate him most strongly with that event, it did not define him. Rather, he helped to define it. And his life kept right on trucking after that.Good performances all around, although I did not believe anyone gave the performance of their career.Often this movie is compared to another film, Tombstone. But Wyatt Earp is aptly titled, because it is not only about Tombstone. It covers decades and brings a sweeping sense of time to the picture. It is also quite lovely. Shot with a sense of honesty, sometimes the characters appear quite unfashionable. They appear real, nonetheless, and don't look like they just stepped out of a Vidal Sasson commercial.Overall, a good biography about a man of the times.",Wyatt Earp
