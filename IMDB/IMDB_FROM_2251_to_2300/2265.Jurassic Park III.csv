0,TheLittleSongbird,The worst of the franchise,1,19 February 2011,"I love the original Jurassic Park, it is such great fun and one of Spielberg's better movies. However, I dislike the third film and The Lost World intensely. This one is the worst of the series, as awful as The Lost World was(it is actually a contender for Spielberg's worst film) this movie's awfulness makes it look like a Oscar winner.Jurassic Park 3's only good points are the splendid scenery and the wonderful looking dinosaurs. Everything else falls down the plug just like that. I was very disappointed in the direction and the music, the sluggishness of Joe Johnston's direction and the banality of the score here makes me miss Steven Spielberg and John Williams even more.The script and story are also major problems. The script is very poor throughout and wastes anyone who has to utter any line from that script. The story is almost non-existent, with superfluous scenes and the odd plot hole. The action sequences also disappoint, instead of being suspenseful they are more mildly amusing but serve no purpose to the plot, while the ending has a that's it? feel to it. The acting is not very good either, and these people are actually very talented, and it doesn't help that none of the characters are very likable. And to top it all off, I thought the film was too short and too rushed as well.So overall, the worst of the franchise and like The Lost World a big disappointment. 1/10 Bethany Cox",Jurassic Park III
1,bkoganbing,Food for the carnivores,3,24 July 2016,"I remember when Jurassic Park II was announced Sam Neill said no way would he be part of a remake. I'm sure good money was offered for number III which changed his mind. That's always a nice cushion when one appears in a stinker.Just like in real life Neill says no way he's in a remake, his paleontologist character says no way he's going back on the island with those dinosaurs. He's seen enough of them up close and personal. But he gets first tricked and forced on the island with a couple who lie to him. William H. Macy and Tea Leoni lost a son who apparently crashed on the island.No way he should have survived. And no way should have they all survived all those prehistoric beasts. But the kid Trevor Morgan is alive. A whole lot of the help that Macy and Leoni bring wind up as food for the carnivores.As for Neill he outfits himself like Indiana Jones and does a bad imitation of Harrison Ford in his performance.But I'm sure the money was good.",Jurassic Park III
2,Leofwine_draca,"Not much story, at least the effects are good",6,8 August 2016,"I can't say my hopes were high about seeing this film - after all, actor William H. Macy publicly proclaimed that the script was ""made up as we went along"" and second sequels rarely work. But, being a sucker for monster fare, I wearily trudged along to the cinema and parted with my hard-earned cash seeking a good time. I got what I paid for with this enjoyable, if lame-brained, old-fashioned adventure yarn with plenty of action and minimal plot.Forget the stultifying first sequel, THE LOST WORLD, as JURASSIC PARK III kicks into high gear with lots of impressive special effects and plenty of dangerous situations for our characters to get themselves into. While not as classy or intelligent as the first film in the series, JURASSIC PARK III offers the audience lots of loud roaring, explosions, people being eaten, and chases which is all a good monster movie should really offer. There's plenty of adrenaline-pumping adventure as our movie ""heroes"" attempt to hide and escape from a whole plethora of dinosaurs, old and new, including the tried-and-trusted velociraptors (who can now talk), plus new creatures like pterodactyls and spinosaurus which keep things fresh and interesting.For a PG film, the movie has a slightly hard edge with a bit of blood and mayhem and a couple of guys getting chomped for good measure, although by now the clichéd formula is strictly aiming to be family fare. Sadly, there isn't any plot other than a contrived method to get all the people on the old island again, although on the plus side this means there isn't any dragging at the beginning - the action starts straight away and never lets up.Sam Neill thankfully returns to the series (he was sorely missed in the last instalment) and steals the show as the mild-mannered Alan Grant; once again putting in a totally honest and likable performance, a great old-fashioned hero character. William H. Macy - a strong character actor in the likes of FARGO - is however wasted as a parent searching for his son, as he has nothing to do other than act the wimp and bond slightly with his ex-wife in slightly nauseous sentimental scenes. Tea Leoni (DEEP IMPACT) plays his wife, and once again sickened me with her terrible performance of a totally stupid and obnoxious character who does insanely stupid things like shout for her son with a loudspeaker. Alessandro Nivola (the baddie's brother in FACE/OFF) is actually quite good and subtle though as Neill's assistant, although somewhat bland with it. Trevor Morgan is the child actor who isn't irritating, while the supporting cast of ""red coats"" (you know, the guys in STAR TREK who you just knew were there to get bumped off) are fairly unmemorable - and there's no character building in the movie. Laura Dern's return is a cheat, little more than a cameo appearance for name value only.Sadly the series shows strong signs of being dumbed down for a modern audience, with the scientific bits being explained carefully for the stupidest viewer. Similarly, scenes in which the actors search through excrement for a vital object or hear a mobile phone ring inside a dinosaur just seem to be silly. Aside from Neill, most of the characters do unfeasibly stupid stuff, like one guy stuffing a raptor egg into his backpack to make some cash. To make matters worse the stupid people are the ones to survive, whilst personally I would have liked to see Leoni and Nivola get torn in half by the spinosaurus.Dumb actions aside, JURASSIC PARK III offers up some most excellent CGI work which is definitely an improvement over the stuff used in THE LSOT WORLD, even if overly familiar now and the shock/wonder value of the original JURASSIC PARK has disappeared. Expect lots of over-the-top situations (the dino/crane fight in particular got me), stunts, cool violence, and action in a slim but satisfying package, and JURASSIC PARK III delivers in spades. For the undemanding thrill-seeking audience, expect no more than a constant stream of well-directed action.",Jurassic Park III
3,SnoopyStyle,Still has all its B-movie goodness,6,2 January 2014,"Dr. Alan Grant (Sam Neill) has gone back to digging and wants no part of the islands. The Kirbys (William H. Macy, Téa Leoni) comes along to offer unlimited funds for his digs if he joins them for a fly-by. Only when he gets there, they want to land and find something valuable.Sam Neill's return is tempered by a all too quick Laura Dern cameo. It's a disappointment that they aren't together. Quite frankly, her cameo serves no purpose other than as a reminder of better days. They are now manufacturing excuses to get these people onto the islands. It feels very fake. The lizard action remains the same. It still has all its B-movie goodness. Téa could do less screaming. Other than that, the action is still a lot of fun.",Jurassic Park III
4,Hitchcoc,Dino Doo Doo,4,19 September 2001,"One reviewer talks about what great special effects this movie has. Well, you know what, everything these days is about special effects. Unfortunately, computer generated images have become so much a part of us, that maybe some people are crying out for a story. When I sat down to see the first movie, my breath was taken away. The dinosaurs were the best I had ever seen put on film. When those brachiosaurs reach up to eat the leaves, I was phenomenal. The cool thing about this movie was that it was as much about what the scientists were doing as about the dinosaurs. The main point in this movie is to see how many people can be chomped down in an hour and a half. The motivations of the actors, the whole kidnapping thing, is so contrived as to be embarrassing. William Macy and Tia Lioni (Tia the frantic) are about as wooden as the trees housing the Pteranodons. Poor Sam Neill. He must have got a lot of money to do this clunker. I think the stupidest thing, however, is the betrayal of the young scientist. Granted, he was careless, but then to be berated, and then be idiotic enough to sacrifice himself to save face, is so manipulative as to be laughable. I won't throw a spoiler at the ending. Suffice it to say that the escape is dependent on one of the most incredible deus ex machinas in the history of filmdom. Somehow, I knew this movie wasn't going to be up to the others, but I had no idea it would be so bad.",Jurassic Park III
5,mark.waltz,There's a new bird in town...,6,4 February 2020,"It's back to the original now abandoned island for Sam Neill, having missed the situation in San Diego and not regretting it, but instantly regretting his agreement to go there thanks to the generous offer of William Macy. Neill thinks that they are just circling the island, but when they land, he's furious. There's something there now bigger than a T-Rex, and the fear on the face of the first victim displays great panic. That leads to their plane crashing and thus stranding them there. A rolling plane that's lost its front and back is merely like a rubber ball for a dinosaur nearly twice the size of a T-Rex, and the battles between it and other dinosaurs are fierce.It turns out that Macy and his ex-wife (Téa Leoni) are searching for their son (Trevor Morgan) who disappeared paragliding and used Neill to get to the island. It's a pretty lame set-up but the thrills are still quite potent. No sooner do they escape the raptors and the mega dino, they have to face a dinosaur that only made a cameo previously: a pterodactyl! The flying carnivore only wants to feed her babies so you can't blame her, but the chase sequence in the giant bird cage (not seen in the first film) is scary and silly with some special effects that are as unbelievable as those used in ""The Day After Tomorrow"" and ""2012"". It is obvious that there is somebody other than Steven Spielberg in the director's chair even though Spielberg was producing.Poor Michael Jeter gets the worst of it here, but I could have had his story over the dull family soap opera that dominates a lot of films like this. Macy is completely irritating, and Leoni's character is ridiculously stupid. Young Trevor Morgan comes off a lot better than his parents, maybe a metaphor for the fact that even the nasty man-eaters are better parents than humans. Alessandro Nivola does make a likable secondary hero even though he was the one who stole the raptor's eggs which could have lead to some chomping conclusions.Maybe one day we'll get a Jurassic Park that deals with the vegetarians that isn't as lame as the 1985 pre-""Jurassic Park"" film ""Baby"". This one culminates with a ringing cellphone pulled out of dino dung and Neill forced to talk on it. I can just hear the eew's coming from the theater with that visual, but fortunately, I can't describe the film as that unfortunate substance that they had to investigate. The ending is one of those where the audience exclaims ""Oh I can't believe they did that!"".",Jurassic Park III
6,classicsoncall,"""It's gonna be a walk in the park.""",7,6 February 2016,"Not being a big fan of movie sequels, I've watched the Jurassic Park films in totally random order with no sense of continuity from one to the next. As a stand alone film, this third movie in the franchise was generally OK, though with it's shorter length and emphasis on action it was rather apparent that the film makers were relying on the success of the first two pictures to make a go of it with this one. The dinosaurs make their presence felt almost immediately, and there's an array of creatures either seen or mentioned that I'd never heard of before, like a 'suchomimus', a 'baryonyx' and a 'spinosaurus aegypticus', so if they appeared on screen, I'm no one the wiser. Actually the 'spinosaurus' had a descriptive enough name, so the walking dinosaur with a large fan on it's back was probably that one. Let's face it, with a franchise like this, the series can probably go on forever if the writers can get creative enough with it. For my part, when I'm looking for a little diversion I can count on a few stand-byes, among them martial arts flicks, Japanese monsters and the occasional dinosaur movie. If I want to think, I go for something else.",Jurassic Park III
7,gavin6942,Munch Popcorn and Turn Off Your Brain For a While,5,27 August 2006,"A decidedly odd couple with ulterior motives convince Dr. Alan Grant to go to Isla Sorna (the second InGen dinosaur lab.), resulting in an unexpected landing...and unexpected new inhabitants on the island.This movie is not overly original since it is just more of the same running from dinosaurs. But, if you liked it the first two times you may well like it again. I will admit the scenery was better this time, the terrain covered much more exciting. And after watching the horrible CGI in ""Snakes on a Plane"", it is nice to see a film made by people who could make convincing digital creatures over ten years ago. Still not as good as the original dinosaurs, but the budget and a tighter schedule are likely to blame for that. Why are these people not working on all the other really bad films?I guess Jeff Goldblum had to pull out of this film because of a leg injury. That makes me sad, because Ian Malcolm is by far the best character in the series. Instead, there is a brief exchange between Sam Neill and a kid about Malcolm's books being ""preachy"". For shame. Preachy or not, Malcolm was the only one who really knew what was going on.This film gave me exactly what I expected: dinosaurs. Pretty much the same thing I expect from Jurassic Park 4: dinosaurs and Keira Knightley.",Jurassic Park III
8,jboothmillard,Jurassic Park III,6,2 November 2006,"The first film is the best of the series (but Jurassic World is fantastic as well), the second film is average, this third instalment is essentially a retread of the other two, but worthwhile, produced by original director Steven Spielberg, directed by Joe Johnston (Honey, I Shrunk the Kids, Jumanji, Captain America: The First Avenger). Basically tourists Ben Hildebrand (Mark Harelik) and Eric Kirby (Mean Creek's Trevor Morgan) are parasailing around the island of Isla Sorna, where the dinosaurs where engineered and nurtured for Jurassic Park, the boat pulling them is attacked by an unseen creature, killing the crew, and Ben is forced to uncouple the line before the boat crashes, he and Eric with him go sailing into the wilderness. Paleontologist Dr. Alan Grant (Sam Neill) has become famous as a result of writing a book about his experiences on Jurassic Park (Dr. Ian Malcolm also wrote a book which is mentioned later), while his friend Dr. Ellie Sattler (Laura Dern) is married to Mark Degler (Taylor Nichols) with two children. Alan discusses with Ellie how raptors are more intelligent than they previously believed, he also discusses his theories at an auditorium lecture, but the audience only want to ask him about Jurassic Park, or the incident in San Diego, but later at his dig site his assistant Billy Brennan (Alessandro Nivola) demonstrates a replicant of the larynx of a Velociraptor, made with 3D printer. Alan is next met by Paul Kirby (William H. Macy) who invites him to dinner with his ""wife"" Amanda (Téa Leoni), the offer him funding for his research if he will guide them on an aerial tour over Isla Sorna, to see the dinosaurs in their natural environment, he reluctantly agrees, joined by Billy, and the Kirbys' mercenary associates, Udesky (Michael Jeter), Cooper (John Diehl) and pilot M.B. Nash (Bruce A. Young). On the plane Alan hears the Kirbys' real intention to land on the island, his knocked out when opposing and wakes to Amanda using a bullhorn to call out to someone, this attracts a Spinosaurus to attack and kill Cooper and Nash and destroy the plane, the fleeing survivors briefly lose the dinosaur, only to encounter a Tyrannosaurus Rex, the Spinosaurus returns and the two carnivores fight, with the Spinosaurus killing the T. Rex, the group escape into the jungle. The Kirbys explain that they are on the island to find their missing son Erik and Amanda's boyfriend Ben, Paul and Amanda are divorced, exploring the island they find the parasail entangled in the trees, Ben's decomposed body is attached to it, they also come across a nest of raptor eggs, they take the parasail with them. The group next find an abandoned InGen compound, soon they encounter a Velociraptor, during the ambush it calls out to its pack, the group flee into a herd of Corythosaurus and Parasaurolophus, causing a stampede, Alan retrieves Billy's dropped satchel, while Udesky is wounded by the raptors, Amanda, Paul and Billy try to help him, but they realise the raptors had set a trap for them, one of them finally kills Udesky. Alan watching them suspects the Velociraptors are searching for something, they ambush and corner him, but is rescued by Eric, he has been surviving the eight weeks he has been missing in an overturned supply truck, the next day the two of them are reunited with Paul, Amanda and Billy. They survive another encounter with the Spinosaurus, then Alan discovers that Billy has stolen two raptor eggs, hidden in his satchel, this provoked the raptor attacks, Billy thought they would be worth a fortune to fund their research, Alan decides to keep them to ensure the group's survival. In the facility the enter they climb down the stairs into a foggy caged area, it is only when the fog clears they realise they are in an aviary, used to house Pteranodons, which attack the group, Eric is rescued by Billy using Ben's parasail, but he is attacked and apparently killed by the Pteranodons, the rest of the group escape the large bird cage, leaving the door unlocked in panic, in a small boat they make their way downriver, heading to the coast. At night, Alan tries to contact Ellie on the satellite phone, but the Spinosaurus attacks the boat, Alan is only able to say the words ""The River! Site B"" before being forced into the water, Alan and Paul scare it away setting leaked fuel on fire. The next day the group are close to the coast, but are ambushed by the pack of Velociraptors, Alan has Amanda hand back the eggs, while he uses the 3D-printed raptor larynx to confuse the pack, they run off with the eggs. In the end the group reach the coast where the the U.S. Navy and U.S. Marine Corps are waiting, called by Ellie, on a helicopter they discover Billy is seriously injured but alive, as they leave they see Pteranodons flying free, Alan guesses they are looking for new nesting grounds. Also starring Taylor Nichols as Mark Degler, Julio Oscar Mechoso as Enrique Cardoso, Blake Michael Bryan as Charlie, Sarah Danielle Goldberg as Cheryl Logan and Linda Park as Hannah. Neill is still likable as the intelligent guide, Leoni could have been on longer, and supporting stars Macy, Leoni, Nivola and Jeter do their parts fine, but as with the other two films before, the dinosaurs brought to life by the fantastic CGI special effects and models are the real stars, including newly evolved or whatever Spinosaurus Eegyptiacus which seems more dangerous and aggressive than the good old T. Rex, it may be same old same old most the way through, and the ending a little dashed off, but you can't help but get into the action, especially the pterodactyl attack scene, an entertaining science- fiction adventure. Good!",Jurassic Park III
9,ccthemovieman-1,Much Better Than Its Reputation; Short & Fun,8,15 May 2006,"First of all, this final episode in the Jurassic series did not deserve all the bad reviews it got when it was released. In fact, it was a lot more enjoyable than the stupid second JP. Did it equal the first? No, of course not. The original story was easily the best of the three, but I found this an enjoyable movie and far better than what I had been led to believe.The filmmakers were smart in making this a short film. People had seen plenty of the dinosaurs by now so let's no overdo it...and they didn't with an film just under an hour-and-a-half (not including the final credits.).That made this short-and-sweet. We saw some new reptiles, had a few scares, enjoyed the beautiful jungle scenery (filmed in Hawaii) and - bang - it's over. The characters were fine, nobody totally annoying as in the second film. The lulls featured a family getting back together and finding their missing teen. Nothing wrong with that.A good story unfairly maligned and nice, short evening of entertainment.",Jurassic Park III
10,rmax304823,Digital Dyspepsia.,2,28 February 2010,"Here's the definition of ""decadence"" from the Free Online Dictionary.1. Being in a state of decline or decay. 2. Marked by or providing unrestrained gratification; self-indulgent.Now you know all you need to know about ""Jurassic Park III."" This third installment has some fine performers in it -- Bill Macy, Sam Neill, Tea Leoni, Laura Dern -- but that's it for the good stuff. They must have received splendid checks.The original ""Jurassic Park"" had a lot of bang for the buck. Just for example, that leisurely sequence in which a cartoon character teaches us dummies about DNA and how to extract it from a mosquito and all that. It followed the classical structure of ""King Kong."" There might be a crisis followed by a temporary resolution. Then another crisis and resolution, but of greater importance. Then another, and so on, until you have King Kong wrecking half of New York City or dinosaurs running loose in the staff cafeteria. Or a shark sinking a fishing boat, to cite another example of the classic narrative structure.Nothing like that here. It's aimed, I suppose, at an audience that is impatient, unwilling to wait for the gradual build up, biting their tongues with the desire for immediate gratification during a suspenseful preamble.Nope. Here, an airplane crashes on an island full of man-eating dinosaurs in the first few minutes. The first human being is eaten after about fifteen minutes. Well -- actually, he's snapped up, chewed a little, then spit out into a mud puddle so he can try to crawl his way to freedom and be eaten again. A supersized meal.It's all noisy as hell, pounding music, screaming people, roaring monsters, crashing trees, smashing airplanes, horror galore, teeth the size of mastodon tusks, and none of the women disrobe.I'd call it a disappointment, only it's not. It's precisely what any sane devotee of the fast buck would produce -- a frantic ripoff of a modestly entertaining and financially successful earlier movie. It's practically an operational definition of decadence.Of course we've always had monster movies, before and after Universal's ""Frankenstein"" in 1931, but they usually had some kind of class. There weren't ALWAYS people getting ripped apart on the screen.I can't help wondering if this cheapening of an art, done at enormous expense, isn't resonating with public taste in some foul infinite loop. The more the kids see of this crap, the more simple-minded they want it to be. Hard-core pornography went through such a cycle. The original porn movies, like ""Deep Throat"", had stories, however banal they may have been. But the producers of those gems quickly figured out that the narrative structure was too complicated, took too long, required some indulgence on the part of the viewers, so compilation porn movies evolved. No stories at all, just a handful of dreary episodes slapped together.Well, how about it? Why have a story in which Neil is hired as a guide to help Macy and Leoni find their lost child on the island? Why bother? Why not just have a series of episodes in which people we don't know or care about get eaten alive with a Wilhelm scream while grotesque monsters ululate behind them, in line sort of, waiting for their turn? In other words, the movie raises a genuine aesthetic question. How decadent can a thing be? Just exactly how low can public taste sink? Are its depths plumbless?",Jurassic Park III
11,ma-cortes,Final chapter from trilogy that provides exciting and sweeping amusing and entertainment,7,7 January 2008,"This enjoyable third entry , plenty of spine-tingler thrills and emotion, deals about archaeologist Alan Grant(Sam Neill) and his pupil archaeologist(Alessandro Nivola). Grant is deceived by a marriage(William H Macy and Tea Leoni) and along with a mercenaries group(Michael Jeter, Bruce A.

The group is chased through lush jungle by fanged creatures from the cretaceous period and genetically engineered formerly.The Dinosaurs are ,once again, the authentic protagonists, they're again marvellous terrifyingly awesome and almost completely convincing, combining elements from previous films . Actors give vigorous physical performances dodging the Dinos, this time appear, an impressive Spinosurious fighting against Rex, a giant Dino-birds and , of course, the intimate Tyrannosaurious and Velocirraptor made by means of incredible combination of computer generator-ILM, Industrial Light Magic- and animatronics models- Stan Winston studio-. Simple dialogue and plain tale, the story is more exciting and inventive than second outing, Lost World, though inferior to first entry, Jurassik Park . The film packs a quite potent soundtrack by Don Davis, remaking the classic score by John Williams. Atmospheric and colorful cinematography reflecting the luxurious jungle by Shelly Johnson. The motion picture is professionally directed by Joe Johnston.

12,BA_Harrison,Dinosaur smack-downs and 'talking raptors'JP3 is dumb fun.,7,29 September 2007,"After making a total mess of The Lost World, Steven Spielberg handed the directorial reins for the third Jurassic Park film over to Joe Johnston. The result isn't as disappointing as Part 2, but it does have quite a few dumb moments which unfortunately mar what could have been a very enjoyable dinosaur romp.Jurassic Park III sees Dr. Grant (Sam Neill) returning to real live dinosaur territory after a couple (William H. Macy and Tea Leone) convince him to be their guide on a flyover of Isla Sorna. However, the sightseers have a hidden agenda: they are really on a mission to find their son, who was lost in the area a couple of months earlier, and they are determined to land on the island...This simple set up means that it doesn't take long before everyone is running for their lives, pursued by raptors, T-Rex, and new lizard-on-the-block, Spinosaurus.As you would expect from a Spielberg produced flick, this one features top-notch digital and animatronic effects, coupled with plenty of impressive action set-pieces. The film sure looks great, but one can't help but wish that as much attention had been paid to the script as to the visuals.Sometimes it's hard to keep a straight face: try not to roll your eyes in disbelief as Grant goes Dr. Dolittle on us and speaks 'raptor' using a 3D model of their 'voicebox'; attempt not to smirk when a ringing telephone swallowed by the Spinosaurus warns the survivors of the creature's impending appearance; and I guarantee you'll laugh when a boy is snatched away from hungry baby pteranodons in the nick of time... by a base-jumping paleontologist in a hastily packed parachute (which he found hanging from a tree!).Before you know it, the whole film is over, wrapped up with a silly rushed ending that seems plucked out of nowhere.However, because my expectations were much lower with Johnston behind the camera than with Spielberg, I actually didn't feel quite so let down by JP3 as I did with The Lost World. In fact, at times I was able to just switch off my brain and enjoy it for the above-average dumb monster packed spectacle that it is.6.5/10, rounded up to 7 for IMDb.",Jurassic Park III
13,Quinoa1984,Spinosaurus? How lame can they get,4,22 July 2001,"Maybe it's just me and maybe I don't have enough knowledge about dinosaurs, but what in the hell is a spinosaurus, and why are people making a big deal about it for the third installment to the Jurrasic Park series?  I have never heard of a dinosaur like this, and it certainly wasn't mentioned in the last movies.  But hey, considering most of this movie is unbelievable (I DON'T mean that as a compliment), I guess it's just park of the sac.Part 3 is one of the worst movies of the year.  An increasingly dumb and hollow action movie that has Niel returning to the island for what- oh a kid, I see.  If they make another Jurrasic Park (which I'm sure they will knowing Hollywood) I hope that they don't stick to this storyline.  Anyway, Niel and company, which includes William H. Macy, Tea Leoni, Michael Jeter and Alessandro Nivola, go on Isla Sona, or Isla Nublar, or whatever Isla, and look for a kid and oh what (is this a spoiler I wonder?) dinosaurs start the attack.  And not only is the spinosaurus present, but so are the infamous velocoraptors who not only plot out traps and can speak to each other, but can also cook Tex-Mex and gorganzola cheeze for no extra charge. AGGH!Sorry to go off like that, but this movie shouldn't have been made.  Sure as far as visual effects go the dinosaurs look good, but after Toy Story, Babe, Shrek, and even the recent Final Fantasy, doesn't having good looking dinosaurs have a similarity to being valedictorian at summer school?  Sure for 1993 and maybe even 1997 they looked great, but so what, it was really the movies themselves that were good, not the dinosaurs (actually, part 2 got a B- from me).  What started off in 1993 as a smashing action film that was skimming as a satire, is now a dumb and incredibly predictable series of movies.To sum up the movie and my sarcasm in this movie review, if you really want to know how bad this movie is, well, have you ever been watching a movie and since the heroes are unappealing and dumb so often that you start rooting for the villains (which in JS3 are the dinosaurs of course)?  Well, it happens here.  Grade: D-",Jurassic Park III
14,BandSAboutMovies,"Great dream sequence, bad film",4,22 June 2018,"The first film in the series to not be based on a Crichton book or directed by Spielberg, who saw the films as ""a big Advil headache.""I hate watched this movie, to be perfectly honest. Why would anyone go near this park? Why would anyone be dumb enough to parasail with pterodactyls? That's what we call thinning the herd. Come on, people.It all starts when Ben Hildebrand takes his girlfriend's kid, Eric Kirby, parasailing with the dinosaurs, as mentioned above. However, they are pulled toward Isla Sorna and Eric's parents, Paul and Amanda (William H. Macy and Tea Leoni) con Dr. Alan Grant into coming back to the island.We learn early on that Dr. Grant screwed things up with Dr. Sattler and that she's married to someone else. He's a man alone, back on digs with an assistant that barely listens to him, Billy Brennan.All the Kirbys say they want to do is fly over the island. However, the mercs on board knock out Grant and then it's time to find Eric, who is actually the most resourceful of everyone.Seriously, this movie felt like it went on forever, as they walked over the same ground trod upon by the other films. That said - the scene where Dr. Grant has the dream on the plane and the raptor talks to him? I could watch that over and over again.",Jurassic Park III
15,michaelRokeefe,Crash landing on the island of Jurassic creatures large and small.,6,27 July 2001,"Are you ready? This is a modest sequel to the original blockbuster dino thriller. This hackneyed story is an improvement over part two. The newest assortment of creatures are what fill the seats anyway. The special effects are tremendous. This is a beautiful movie to watch.An estranged couple from Oklahoma(William H. Macy and Tea Leoni) use false pretenses to persuade the noted Dr. Alan Grant(Sam Neil)to help search and find their young son(Trevor Morgan). My favorite scenes are the plane crash and watching Macy's character fumble for change to operate a candy machine in a deserted lab.Also in the cast are Michael Jeter, Laura Dern and Alessandro Nivola. Dinosaur fans will be greatly pleased. Macy is near perfection. Leoni is extra easy on the eyes.

This is also the first film that would not involve the original author Michael Crichton into the creative process since it is not based from any of the novels that he has written.The story is set on ""Site B"" of the fictional deserted island Isla Sorna located near Costa Rica at Central America.Wealthy couple Paul and Amanda Kirby has double-crossed scientist Dr.Alan Grant into having a fly-over on the said island.The purpose was a sightseeing tour of the cloned dinosaurs.After they all landed in the island,the Kirby couple try to locate their lost teen-age son after being involved in a paragliding accident.Trapped in the island,they try locate the missing son amidst the danger posed by the said dinosaurs particularly the Tyrannosaurus Rex,better known as the T-Rex, and the flying Pteranodons,which is said to provide more danger than the T-Rex.No question that the third film provides a darker and more thrilling scenes.We get to see more scary and violent scenes as compared to the previous films combined.Viewers are treated to more non-stop action and violent scenes with the cloned dinosaurs especially with the different characters involved.Just like the second film,it once again does not concentrate on the characters but more on the cloned dinosaurs that are ready to kill anytime.Nothing really happens in it as the primary purpose of the story is to locate the Kirby's son and to remain alive at the conclusion of the film.Overall, viewers wanting to see thrillers provided by dinosaurs will probably be pleased by it.",Jurassic Park III
17,hitchcockthelegend,Reverse Darwinism - survival of the most idiotic.,5,19 July 2009,"Eight years after the horrors of Jurassic Park, we find Dr. Alan Grant happy with his lot, nothing on Earth could coax him back on to one of the ""InGen Islands."" Trouble is, is that Paul and Amanda Kirby, in the search for their missing son, get him to Isla Sorna without his knowing anything about it, and sure enough, dinosaurs are set to rule their evolved world once more.Clocking in at just about 83 minutes in actuality, you sense that director Joe Johnston (Jumanji) knew he had to get in quickly, do his job, and get the hell out of Dodge ASAP. Sure enough, JP3 feels like (is) a quick coin in, the formula is straight up simple from the executive desks, dump a load of annoying characters on an island and see if they can survive being chomped on by dinosaurs. That the makers managed to get Sam Neil and William H. Macy on board with such a turgid script, is nothing short of amazing. Perhaps just as Neil's character is duped in the film, so shall it be in real life...Still, it's no abomination by any stretch of the imagination. Johnston, realising that the audience wants dino action, wastes no time in letting the critters loose on our motley crew. Which in spite of the child friendly nature of the piece (think more chase movie adventure than monster peril) is all rather spiffing and enjoyable. You may find yourself hoping the irritable Téa Leoni gets eaten, and you may find yourself laughing at some of Alessandro Nivola's scenes when you are not meant to (is that a Superman homage?), but at least it's fun enough to get away with the bad points. Thanks in the main to the creatures and the relatively short running time. 5/10",Jurassic Park III
18,Theo Robertson,Seen It All Before,6,21 April 2003,"Despite having a good opening hook I didn`t really hold out much hope for JP3 and I was right . It`s not the worst blockbuster film I`ve seen but it has committed the sin of becoming a franchise film . It does deserve some brownie points of having humourous scenes like the dream sequence of a talking dinosaur , but the plot of Dr Grant being coaxed back to Dinosaur Island where a group of humans attempt to survive against flesh eating prehistoric monsters is something I`ve seen perhaps a little too often . It is a mildly entertaining film but after seeing THE MATRIX and THE LORD OF THE RINGS audiences have rightly come to demand something a bit more from a Hollywood blockbuster",Jurassic Park III

He is approached by the couple Paul and Amanda Kirby (William H. Macy and Tea Leoni) to accompany them on their latest adventure. They *say* that they're a rich, affluent pair of thrill seekers who want Grant along for his expertise when they intend to go on a plane tour of Isla Sorna (the site of the second movie). As we can figure out, they're not playing it straight with him, and have another motive in mind. Predictably, the plane *does* land on the island. All Hell breaks loose as yet another gang of raptors and a particularly nightmarish menace called a spinosaur stalk our not too bright protagonists.""Jurassic Park III"" really isn't all that bad. Of course it's going to come up short when compared to the first movie, but the filmmakers have crafted a reasonable thrill ride with a very good pace. Unlike the other movies in this series, this runs a mere 93 minutes (84 or so without the end credits), which goes to show that this kind of entertainment doesn't need to go on for very long. One understandable complaint is that the dinosaurs here don't do a lot of people munching; only a few characters get gobbled up, and you can pretty much guess who they'll be. This does manage to be somewhat intense nevertheless. It's *not* without its sillier and more annoying moments (the nightmare sequence comes to mind), and Ms. Leoni is unfortunately obliged to play the kind of twit whom we all hope and pray becomes dinosaur chow.All things considered, this is still better than the average SyFy cheese fest, if only because of the substantial major studio budget and the very talented crew. The special effects this time are variable - sometimes the dinosaurs look great, and sometimes they don't. The entire night time segment on the river is a solid set piece, and things culminate in what is a hilariously over the top resolution.Another thing giving this an edge over a more typical B movie is a cast of pros. They play the material for all that it's worth, with Neill doing a good job. Trevor Morgan is appealing as the obligatory child character Eric, and a couple of truly excellent character actors - Michael Jeter, John Diehl, Bruce A. Young, and Julio Oscar Mechoso - fill out supporting roles. Laura Dern reprises her part of Ellie Sattler in what is basically an extended cameo.Written by Peter Buchman, Alexander Payne (the director whose works include ""Sideways"" and ""Election"") and Jim Taylor.Seven out of 10.",Jurassic Park III

21,poolandrews,"""We're in the worst place in the world & not even getting paid for it."" Decent sequel.",7,29 December 2006,"Jurassic Park III starts with Dr. Alan Grant (Sam Neill) as he is contacted by Paul (William H. Macy) & Amanda Kirby (Tea Leoni) who want him has a guide for when they fly over 'Site B', the island which is overrun by Dinosaurs & featured in The Lost World: Jurassic Park (1997). Paul offers Alan a load of cash which he can't turn down so along with his assistant Billy Brennan (Alessandro Nivola) for company & the Kirby's people they fly to the island but the Kirby's seems uninterested in the Dinosaurs below & actually land the plane against Alan's wishes. It turns out that the Kirby's are looking for their young son Eric (Trevor Morgan) who disappeared on the island while para-sailing nearby a few weeks ago, unfortunately they are attacked by a huge Spinosaurus who eats several people & wrecks the plane. The survivor's are trapped, without communication to the outside world, no way to reach safety & surrounded by various carnivorous Dinosaurs both small & large...Directed by Joe Johnston I thought Jurassic Park III was an OK time waster, you know it's one of those big budget Hollywood films which has no soul or real purpose other than entertain & dazzle with state-of-the-art special effects & it's extravagant set pieces. The script by Pete Buchman, Alexander Payne & Jim Taylor is something of a mystery as it was widely reported that the film was shooting before the script had been completed, in fact William Macy spoke to the press & criticised the film over this aspect. Maybe that's why the film turned out so shallow? Maybe that's why the character's are cardboard cutouts? Maybe that's why the dialogue is so simplistic? Maybe that's why some of the ideas here are never really followed through? Maybe that's why the whole Raptors being intelligent & even being able to 'talk' to each other comes across as just plain stupid? Oh, & why did the script have to include yet another annoying kid? Who knows? The film certainly moves along at a decent pace, it has the requisite number of action/special effects set pieces (some of which were apparently left over ideas from the scripts of the previous two Jurassic Park films which also says something in itself) & as a Hollywood spectacle it's perfectly reasonable. I don't know, it's watchable in a popcorn kind of way but ultimately it's shallow & lives or dies by it's special effects.Director Johnston does alright, there's a distinct lack of tension & there's not much in the way of scares either plus he ruins the Raptor's by making them intelligent. The new Dinosaur's are cool & as expected the special effects are top-notch, they're pretty much flawless. I particularly liked the flying Pterodactyl's & the scene when they attack Alan & co. is my favourite part of the film. There's not as much blood in this one & the whole tone seems lighter, only a couple of people get eaten on screen this time around.With a supposed budget of about $93,000,000 Jurassic Park III is as well made as the previous entries & definitely has that Hollywood polish about it although they didn't spend much of that on the music as it's the same John Williams theme that is used throughout the previous entries. The acting doesn't matter that much, everyone plays second fiddle to the Dinosaurs anyway. Interesting according to the IMDb Jeff Goldblum & his character Ian Malcolm were included but he injured his leg during the first few days of filming & dropped out, a shame as he is the best character in the Jurassic Park films.Jurassic Park III is good solid popcorn entertainment, the special effects are predictably impressive & if all you want are action set pieces & Dinosaurs then this is just about as good as most out there. Worth a watch. According to the IMDb the script for Jurassic Park IV (2008) is currently being developed...",Jurassic Park III
22,zardoz-13,"""Jurassic Park 3"" Is Hideous!",3,17 March 2009,"""Jurassic Park 3"" doesn't take itself seriously like its predecessors and neither should you. Director Steven Spielberg and best-selling author Michael Crichton, who collaborated on the superlative ""Jurassic Park"" (1993) and the knockout sequel ""The Lost World (1997), had something to say about scientists who play God and the dangers of cloning. Sadly, Spielberg and Crichton had nothing to do with this sequel. Former ""Star Wars"" art director Joe Johnston of ""October Sky"" (1999), ""The Rocketeer"" (1991), and ""Honey, I Shrunk the Kids"" (1989) replaced Spielberg. You'd think Johnston's experience on ""Jumanji"" (1995) where zoo animals stomped everything in sight, would have made him an ideal candidate. Unfortunately, it didn't. You can count the major differences between Johnston's ""Jurassic Park"" and Spielberg's ""Jurassic Parks"" in minutes. ""JP3"" clocks in at about 90 minutes, while both Spielberg epics exceeded two hours. Although it isn't as pretentious as the first two movies, ""JP3"" relies far more on humor than horror to its detriment. This lukewarm, less-than-savage installment in the cloned-dinosaurs-run-amok series makes references to its predecessors that only hardcore, nitpicking ""Jurassic Park"" fans could catch. The joke about Jack Horner was cute. The dinosaurs are just as menacing, even though bloodthirsty moviegoers may feel cheated. (Imagine what Italian gorefest cult director Lucio Fulci would have done with a ""Jurassic Park"" movie.) Missing this time around is 'chaos theoretician' Dr. Ian Malcolm (Jeff Goldblum of ""Independence Day""), who enlivened both the original and the follow-up with his sarcasm. Paleontologist Dr. Alan Grant (Sam Neill of ""Jurassic Park""), who skipped out on ""The Lost World,"" returns as the dullest of dull heroes, while Grant's former colleague Dr. Ellie Sattler (Laura Dern of ""October Sky"") reappears in a welcome cameo. Grant visits her in the opening scene and finds her happily married to a U.S. State Department official with a toddler son and baby daughter. Before she waves goodbye, Ellie reminds Grant to call her if he ever needs her help. Predictably, freshman scenarist Peter Buchman, along with writers Alexander Payne and Jim Taylor of ""Election"" and ""Citizen Ruth"" don't let her welsh on her promise. Film scriptwriting manuals classify this as 'foreshadowing,' setting up some future action so it doesn't appear to haphazardly pop up out of the blue.Basically, ""JP3"" follows the formula that ""Jurassic Park"" and ""The Lost World"" created with greater detail and daring. Reportedly, after Johnston perused the shooting script, he tore it up and ordered rushed rewrites. If this was the best they could contrive, no wonder ""JP3"" is so forgettable. Not only did ""The Lost World"" raise the stakes, but it also surpassed the original with its thrills and chills. Clearly, the third time wasn't the charm. ""Jurassic Park 3"" is as pedestrian as ""Jaws 3."" If you've seen the others, you know Laura Dern's cameo at the outset is standard ""Jurassic Park"" practice. In ""The Lost World,"" Malcolm reunited briefly with John Hammond (Richard Attenborough of ""The Great Escape"") and his grandchildren: Timothy 'Tim' Murphy (Joseph Mazzello) and Alexis 'Lex' Murphy (Ariana Richards) in an early scene. Children cannot die in the ""Jurassic Park"" franchise. Neither apparently can mother nor fathers. So much for suspense. Like ""Jurassic Park,"" ""Jurassic Park 3 has our desperate heroes plundering piles of dinosaur dung in search of a satellite phone that could serve as their salvation. That stinking satellite phone infuriated me initially when I heard it ring. I figured that some fool had left their cell phone ringer on in the theatre! Nevertheless, Sarah Harding owned a tattered camera bag she called her lucky bag, just as Belly Brennan sorts a similar camera bag. The scene where Tea Leoni hangs from a tree as ravenous raptors leap up at her alludes to the kitchen scene near the end of ""Jurassic Park."" Instead of being jostling about in small recreational vehicles, Dr. Grant finds himself slammed around in the wrecked fuselage of a plane by a dinosaur. This scene lacks the sheer terror of the T-Rex's introduction in ""Jurassic Park"" and doesn't generate the suspense of ""The Lost World"" cliffhanger scene. Billy steals raptor eggs, and the mothers pursue them across Isla Sorna in a variation on ""The Lost World"" heroes that freed an injured T-Rex baby with a broken leg and found its irate mother pushing their motor home over a cliff. ""The Lost World"" T-Rexes subjected the motor home to more hair-raising demolition than the ""JP3"" T-Rex does to the plane. This time around baby Pterodactyls attack a teenager, much as ""The Lost World"" lizards swarmed after a little rich girl. The major revelation here is the raptors can communicate with each other and might possibly have supplanted primates. Wait, didn't those same raptors communicate with each other back in ""Jurassic Park"" in the kitchen scene? ""Jurassic Park"" and ""The Lost World"" definitely weren't for the squeamish, but ""Jurassic Park 3"" should give nobody nightmares. As in the first two entries, the genetically engineered dinosaurs walk tough, howl vividly, and snap up hapless humans in their jaws. Indeed, the visual effects technology has improved exponentially; sadly, the art of scriptwriting has regressed just as much. Unlike Spielberg, Johnston takes neither the plot nor the stakes to a higher level. Moreover, nothing in ""Jurassic Park 3"" matches either the T-Rex gobbling up the lawyer, Donald Gennaro (Martin Ferrero of ""Get Shorty""), in the original or the scenes from ""The Lost World"" where two T-Rexes tore poor Eddie Carr (Richard Schiff) apart. Grant calls Ellie when a real dino tries to chomp and/or drown everybody. Hilariously, her young son delays taking her the phone so he can watch his favorite Barney the Purple Dinosaur episode! The out of place Barney scene deflates any suspense or tension that the Site B dinosaur causes as he rips away at a cage housing our heroes. Anybody who thrilled to the first two ""Jurassic Park"" creature features will probably roll their eyeballs in disbelief at the infantile idiocy of ""Jurassic Park 3.""",Jurassic Park III

It has all been done before how can they possibly come up with a new movie with a believable story. But the movie turned out to be actually pretty good.One of the reasons why this movie became successful for me was because of the different approach. ""Jurassic Park"" and ""The Lost World"" took itself very serious and tried to create a somewhat believable story, while Jurassic Park III had far more humor in it and it was obvious that the makers didn't tried to create a breathtaking movie with lot's of tension and a realistic story, but a fun entertaining non-sense movie instead.The story is also better then I expected, at least it's original and it has some nice moments in it. It's a big plus that finally those dinosaur-birds (sorry, don't remember their name) appear in the movie. The raptors are also cooler then ever. They're not as scary as in the first and second movie, but at least they look better in this one. And that goes for all the dinosaurs. There are some more nice new dinosaurs in this one but I won't mention them all.It's great to see Sam Neill return as Dr. Alan Grant and same goes for Laura Dern as Dr. Ellie Sattler (although here role is pretty small but yet important) Alessandro Nivola is a great addition to the cast as Billy Brennan. The other characters are more for the comedy elements which works pretty well.So my conclusion: An entertaining movie that is good for a few laughs and a good movie with some nice scene's and better then ever special effects for the dinosaurs.I'm actually looking forward to ""Jurassic Park IV""!7/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",Jurassic Park III

So, for the third time we get to watch an adventure involving people and prehistoric creatures, no matter how contrived the story was. A boy and his uncle (or some other adult) end up at Jurassic Park (go figure) and his parents con Dr. Alan Grant into taking them there to rescue their son. Nevermind that the boy should have been dead within his first few hours on death island, but for Alan Grant to get conned by two relatively dumb and lame parents was also absurd.Once past the unimaginative story to reunite Dr. Grant with the park, the movie goes well. Besides the regular dino menaces, there was a new addition. There was a big bad carnisaur, even bigger and badder than the T-Rex. It was definitely good they added another creature character, and they even had to battle Pteridactyls as well (which was cool). Of course, the special effects were good, as was the setting, scenery, and suspense. Albeit, this wasn't nearly as good as the first, but it was still good.",Jurassic Park III

Tea Leoni is beautiful, but live or die, I get to go home.  William H. Macy is ordinarily the guy that creates some interest, but his character falls just short. That leaves the returning Dr. Grant (Sam Neill).  He is believable in his role, but disappointing in his naivety.  Wouldn't you want certified funds? I will go see this movie again just to count the close-ups of Neill and his raised eye-brow.  Must be at least 7 in this short 85 minute flick.  Who does he think he is, Barbra Streisand?

He kindly declines but this only gets him knocked out and forced. They really needed his help in finding their son who had become stranded on the island. Soon enough nameless characters are attacked and devoured by carnivores because the studios view it as entertainment. This all ends on a pleasant note without any mention of those who were eaten. Director Joe Johnston of Jumanji fame does his best. Neill was appealing in the first film but here his role is mere cardboard. William H. Macy and Tea Leoni are embarrassing as the couple. Both are capable actors going way beneath their talent. Trevor Morgan plays their son who is about as bad as any kid who wanders away from their parents at the mall.

32,Wuchakk,Weak story and characters with great jungle action,5,16 December 2012,"""Jurassic Park III"" is a decent 2001 sequel, marginally better than 1997's ""The Lost World."" It has a been-there-seen-that feel and lacks the huge suspense build-up of the 1993 original. Whereas ""Jurassic Park"" took a whole hour to get to the dino-action, this second sequel jumps to it in the first 15 minutes with a huge fight between a spinosaurus and a t-rex. Of course the former beats the latter to show the audience who's the baddest mofo on the island. (Incidentally, one dinosaur expert pointed out that, although the spino is larger than the t-rex, its head and maw aren't. In fact, the more slender and crocodilian shape of its head would make it virtually impossible to do what it does to the t-rex. Besides, the spino was basically a fish-eater).In addition to the spinosaurus, we are treated to a good pteranodon scene and another velociraptor sequence (but nowhere near as good as the original), not to mention brief scenes with brachiosaures and anklyosaures.The best part of the story is the return of Sam Neill as Dr. Grant and Laura Dern looks great in a cameo part, but the rest of the characters are weak and forgettable. In fact, the story is merely a clothesline that links the many dinosaur attack scenes in the jungle.At only 1 hour and 24 minutes (or thereabouts) before the credits role this is not a deep story with fleshed-out characters – flesh-eaten, maybe, but not fleshed-out. If you thought the original film had a weak story and characters, double that here. But the dinosaurs look great and the action sequences are thrilling. These may be worth the price of admission for some but, at the end of the day, ""Jurassic Park III"" is just really forgettable.GRADE: C",Jurassic Park III

It's been a long while since I've seen a movie that made me clench my teeth, squint my eyes, and grasp on to the chair arms tightly. Since 1992, to be exact, when the first Jurassic Park came out. When the sequel came out several years later, I was in line. And I was swiftly and painfully disappointed. However, I did enjoy it as one of those so-bad-it's-funny sort of movies. Now comes JPIII, a film that, when I heard that it was in production, I scoffed and swore I'd never go. But, when many critics approved of it, I thought that it wouldn't hurt to go see a matinee.And that's exactly what it was worth. It's a Saturday matinee. It's a Saturday, and I did see the matinee show at 5:00 PM. And it was as fun as any movie I've seen in a long time. There were problems. The exposition was convoluted and difficult to fully understand (how did Mr. Kirby (Bill Macy) charter a flight anyways? Who were all those supporting characters who bought it so quickly? Why are Sam Neill and Laura Dern divorced? Why the heck are there dinosaurs we never saw in the second movie, and, better yet, why are they always running into them?). Suspense, however, is built very well. Maybe not as well as the first movie, but still quite well. The two new dinosaurs are the Spinosaurus Aegypticus (sounds made up to me) and the Pterodactyl. Both are awesome sights, especially the spinosaur. The scene where they find pterodactyls is the most exciting in the film. I'm glad to see Sam Neill back. Even more glad to see Jeff Goldblum gone (his career is so in the toilet it's not even funny; there's a great jab at his annoying character in this film). Glad to see that Laura Dern has a reduced role (kind of wish they had kept her out all together; her cameo, and the way she comes back later in the picture, felt incomplete and silly). Bill Macy and Tea Leoni are great supporting characters. Trevor Morgan is good as their son, even if it is unbelievable that he could have survived there for two months when the dinos are so darn intelligent (he kind of has a Newt (Aliens) thing going for him). The one really awful character/actor is Alessandro Nivola as Billy, a grad student who accompanies his teacher (Neill) on the expedition. He's nothing but a mimbo (cf. Seinfeld). He can't act and his character is annoying. I nearly clapped when I thought he was pterodactyl food, but his deus ex machina reappearance in the end dropped this film down a notch in my mind. If he returns in the sequel, I probably won't go. All in all, 7/10.",Jurassic Park III

Neither character had Goldblum's snappy lines and snarky sense of humor, Alan Grant is a welcome sight. If you're going to return to the island with a a group of dumb people, you'd be hard pressed to find someone more reliable.What's disappointing about the movie is that it's a good cast playing undeveloped characters.

'Jurassic Park III' Synopsis: A decidedly odd couple with ulterior motives convince Dr. Alan Grant to go to Isla Sorna (the second InGen dinosaur lab.), resulting in an unexpected landing...and unexpected new inhabitants on the island.'Jurassic Park III' isn't as amazing as compared to it's predecessors, but yet it packs in solid entertainment. Also, the film is quite short in terms of length, which also works on it's advantage. It never drags or lags. Peter Buchman, Alexander Payne & Jim Taylor's Screenplay is throughly entertaining & adventurous. Joe Johnston's Direction, is well-balanced. Cinematography is stunning. Editing is good. Graphics are brilliant. Performance-Wise: Sam Neill is good. William H. Macy is in form, as always. Téa Leoni is impressive. Alessandro Nivola leaves a mark. Trevor Morgan is first-rate. Others lend good support. On the whole, 'Jurassic Park III' is a complete entertainer. Go for this adventure!",Jurassic Park III
36,StevePulaski,When a powerhouse franchise crumbles,4,12 June 2015,"I mentioned in my review of The Lost World: Jurassic Park that it would be difficult to call a dinosaur film, at that time, at least, ""routine"" or cliché because of how rarely dinosaurs were put on film. With Jurassic Park III, however, we now have two very capable films to compare this one to, and this, on top of several issues this installment bears, work to not only derail a franchise that had fairly solid footing in the ground but managed to defy odds to become one of the few defining films in American history for its special effects.Jurassic Park III can't manage to conjure up the same kind of danger that the original film did, nor the moodiness and the energetic cast of misfits of the second film. It plays like a theme park ride, with little sense of danger and a heavy sense of perfunctory happenings that simply occur in without much added spark of ingenuity or creativity behind them. Where Steven Spielberg had a method to his madness, and a terrific sense of buildup in both of his films, director Joe Johnston and writers Peter Buchman, Alexander Payne (yes, Election and Sideways Alexander Payne), and Jim Taylor simply stumble when trying to find a route to take with Jurassic Park III that works and breeds new life into material that's beginning to show signs of wear.We refocus on Dr. Alan Grant (Sam Neill) of the first film, who is now refreshed with the events of Jurassic Park out of his mind. Despite saying he has no ambition to return to a life involving dinosaurs, Dr. Grant meets a man named Paul Kirby (William H. Macy) and his wife Amanda (Téa Leoni), who cut him a blank check to give them an aerial tour of the island of Isla Sorna. He reluctantly agrees until, while on the plane, realizes that the Kirby's want to land on and explore the island, resulting in a plane crash that leaves the three of them, plus Grant's son Billy (Alessandro Nivola) and a handful of Kirby's men, stranded in a playground filled with dinosaurs. Worst of all, many of the dinosaurs are Pterodactyls, soaring menaces that hunt for prey on the ground before scooping them up and taking off without a trace.The Pterodactyls steal the show in this film, for they are the ones who are unpredictable, quick-witted, and more entertaining to watch than the group of misplaced actors on display. The Lost World had the likes of Jeff Goldblum, Julianne Moore, and Vince Vaughn, all actors you wouldn't think would star in a Jurassic Park film, but somehow found their way onto the set and decided to make due with what they had. In turn, they turned into be a cast of likable character actors, making for one of the most surprisingly functional misfit casts I have yet to see.Jurassic Park III, on the other hand, is what happens when a series of actors find themselves working together and something feels off. It's not really an involvement thing, but there seems to be a general level of discomfort amongst the actors; actors like Macy and Leoni seem terribly out of place with a film like this, and no character, not even Grant, bears any likability throughout the course of the film. The original Jurassic Park had its share of empty characters, but at least devoted enough time to them to show that Spielberg and company were trying to provide audiences with an even balance of talking and action, whereas The Lost World found a way to more-or-less balance the dichotomy out to a rather effective level. Jurassic Park III can't seem to do either very convincingly; it's too busy trying to set up the next action sequence when it focuses on the characters and is too busy looking for an easy way out during the action sequences.Finally, there's the emotionally manipulative angle that comes up with this film too, particularly in the ending, which ties everything together with a very incredulous circumstance combined with cloying choral music to let us know that everybody involved is safe and sound. This kind of thing only works to soil the scope and power of the original film and the kind of dark, brooding atmosphere The Lost World bravely built. The special effects are still strong, only this time, merging CGI with animatronics leaves a bit of a hokiness to the dinosaurs, particularly the Velociraptor, which bears a feathery coat (while this may be more scientifically accurate, it looks messy and unbelievable on-screen). Where the other two films were creating a powerhouse franchise in film, Jurassic Park III is looking for a quick buck, and that part is evident from the cast choices, the writing, and the general feel, all of which feel significantly squandered and traded in for something convenient rather than daring.Starring: Sam Neill, William H. Macy, Téa Leoni, and Alessandro Nivola. Directed by: Joe Johnston.",Jurassic Park III
37,Smells_Like_Cheese,"Well, yeah, it was silly, but somewhat enjoyable",6,19 June 2006,"Jurrassic Park 3 is kind of a rip off of Jurrassic Park 1, it's just going back to the island for another adventure. I also thought the CGI effects were also more unrealistic than the first. Why is it that it seems that the older CGI films have better effects than today's CGI effects? :D But anyways, in some way I think I did enjoy this film. I thought the character development when well and the story made sense. It wasn't just like ""Let's get back on the island"", they had a purpose that made sense. So I would recommend this film, especially if you want to complete the series. It isn't a bad movie, this is probably the better sequel.6/10",Jurassic Park III
38,MovieAddict2016,"`Jurassic Park III' is every bit better than `The Lost World: Jurassic Park' and a step down from the original, which is where sequels should be.",10,12 March 2003,"Some SpoilersSequels are usually horrid things. Sometimes they come out okay, but most of the time they are a disgrace to the original. Well, ""Jurassic Park III"" might have been cashing in on ""Jurassic Park"" a bit, but it is still a solid action movie.Sam Neill reprises his role as Dr. Alan Grant from the first film. He has recently been trying to get funding for a new scientific process revolved around dinosaurs. His theory states that velociraptors used to ""Talk"" to each other by means of vocalization in the throat. High pitched screams, if you will. Unfortunately for Grant, no one really cares about this - they all want to hear about his experience at John Hammond's Jurassic Park. A tired Grant, exhausted from having to explain all the time, now ignores questions about the park, as we see in the beginning of the film when he says, ""Any questions?"" And everyone raises their hands. He then says, ""Any questions NOT regarding Jurassic Park?"" Everyone puts their hands down.Desperately seeking money for his funding, Grant reluctantly agrees to fly over Isla Sorna - site B of Jurassic Park (the island in the first sequel) - with rich explorers/couple William H. Macy and Tea ""Emma Thompson lookalike"" Leoni. But after their plane lands on the island, Grant realizes the truth behind the couple's story...and comes face-to-face with a new breed of dino.""Jurassic Park III""'s respect for the original comes in very handy. It is easy to see that the filmmakers were ready to try again after the awful ""Lost World"" sequel, and they pulled it off well.Steven Spielberg has since handed over the reigns to new-yet-old director Joe Johnston. `'Jurassic Park' is one of those turning points in movies,' Johnston states. `They put a living, breathing dinosaur on the screen. These are hard movies to make.' Well, if I do say so myself, `Jurassic Park III' is every bit better than `The Lost World: Jurassic Park' and a step down from the original, which is where sequels should be. Not that I don't like sequels to surpass the originals. I do like that. But sometimes sequels try too hard to overcome the original (`Lost World') and fail miserably. What Johnston and team did is great. They knew they couldn't beat the original, so they spiced it up in other areas. They didn't re-hash the original.For instance, there is more of a man-against-nature feel in this film. Dr. Grant and friends are trapped in this marsh land and are surrounded by dinosaurs. Unlike they could in the first film, the humans have nowhere indoors to go. It's man-against-nature, and it creates a very pleasant mix of paranoia and suspense for the audience, and some lush landscapes.At times I feel like I could reach out and grab the marsh they are in. Unlike some films (including the original, to a certain degree) the plants don't look fake. They have the same look as the first film (remember all those ferns?) without looking as cheesy. They don't look like plastic.And much is the same with the ever-improved dinosaurs. The detail on the dinos is amazing in this film. Their muscles move care-free, their skin has the coating of a lizard, and we feel like they are real. There is an excellent scene with a fighting t-rex and spinosaurus. You simply can't get your dino fix any better than that.If you read my original review on `Jurassic Park,' I state how much I hate it when CGI is not-so-seamlessly blended with puppets and plastic models. One scene the creatures are moving carefree when they are digitalized, in another they are puppets that move slow with no muscles. Well, that's what I enjoyed about the `Jurassic Park' trilogy. THE DINOSAURS LOOK REAL WHEN THEY ARE CGI AND PUPPET. You can't tell when it's CGI and when it's fake puppets. We can thank the best creature effects man out there: Stan Winston, whose work I have appreciated since `The Terminator' to `Predator' (extra koudos on that suit!) to `Terminator 2: Judgment Day.' Winston is the best, plain and simple.And the acting in this sequel is nothing to fuss about. Unlike the complete one-eighty Ian Malcolm (Jeff Goldblum) did in the first film-to-sequel - from annoying guy to brave, annoying guy who thinks he's smart - Grant is the same as always. He reminds me of Indiana Jones - and no, not because of the hat. It is because his personality is the same. He doesn't really enjoy what he's doing, but he does is anyway, because he is Grant, and that's his job.William H. Macy uses his acting ability to full advantage here - I still say he'd make great as Ned Flanders if they ever made a live-action `Simpsons' movie/show.I have read both `Jurassic Park' books by Michael Crichton. The first novel is one of the best books I have ever read, and I have read a few thousand. It easily blends everything you want in a novel. Something about the way Crichton writes gets me hooked even if the story stupid. I recently read `Rising Sun.' Most books I start to read nowadays I read one hundred pages into and drop. I've been guilty of this with John Grisham and Robert Ludlum novels. But I finished `Rising Sun' in a few busy days. What I'm trying to get at here, is that Michael Crichton is one of my favorite living authors, if not THE favorite. And I must say, his books have been done justice - well, at least the first one. I respect that one of my favorite books by one of my favorite authors was treated well. The third film wasn't based on a book, but it still does justice to the roots of the tale, and that is always good.`Jurassic Park III' is more than just a surprising sequel.4/5 stars",Jurassic Park III
39,KineticSeoul,Just forget this one ever happened,3,23 July 2015,"This installment doesn't have what it takes to carry on the ""Jurassic Park"" name. It's like this movie was just a quick cash in without any effort put into it. The plot just seemed lazy, a movie can be simple and yet good, but that doesn't apply to this movie. Watching this movie was like watching some sort of corny children's movie or a live action cartoon. The whole direction is not just corny, but it just doesn't make much sense. I mean watching this flick as a kid I thought it was ""Meh"" just okay. But watching it now, not just because of the lack of good cinematography or CGI. I think the only actually decent part about this movie was that it has the return of Sam Neill as Dr. Alan Grant. Even the last remaining survivors weren't even that likable, and some even detestable. Despite the film trying to make them into comic relief. Overall, this is a bland adventure movie. It's somewhat watchable, but really disappointing for a Jurassic Park movie.3.8/10",Jurassic Park III
40,OllieSuave-007,Just a lot of running around.,7,26 December 2004,"This movie is like an episode of a TV series, a very plain plot and has no real significance. Here, Dr. Alan Grant is summoned by two desperate parents to help them find their lost son on the dinosaur-inhabited island. This movie's two predecessors have significance, the first one being Dr. Hammond's ""mistake"" of creating dinosaurs and trying to exploit them, and the second one being Dr. Hammond's redemption on his past mistakes. This third entry is just lots of running around, a rescue mission. Lots of action and dinosaurs though, with some decent special effects, especially the execution of the pterandons, but not much of a story. Is also doesn't have the suspense as its two prequels. Some of the characters were pretty cheesy, but mostly watchable, and the movie does have some neat dinosaur fight scenes and cool visual effects. Overall, an OK and somewhat fun movie nonetheless to pass the time. Let's just hope that Jurassic Park IV is a winner.Grade B-",Jurassic Park III
41,thesar-2,Get Closer withThe Adventures of Jungle-Boy,1,23 January 2011,"Say what you want about Jurassic Park (JP1,) or the inferior follow-up, The Lost World: Jurassic Park (JP2,) you know you had a good thing when the name ""Steven Spielberg"" is written on the back of the director's chair.This (should've been) direct-to-video mess of a movie, unoriginally called Jurassic Park III (JP3)– I'm guessing only because they wanted to show claws for the I-I-I, failed on EVERY LEVEL. So much so, I don't know where to begin.Was the downfall the awful (and over-)acting? The terrible dialogue – including one of the most unintentionally hilarious scenes, when the raptor calls out Alan's name? The downsized special effects? The sheer mockery of using the classic original score to remind us of a better film? The idiotic reasons to get both Laura Dern back and Sam Neill as well as Sammy back on an island full of dinos? How about the Saving Private Ryan Spielberg tribute finale or was it Jungle-Boy? (More on that atrocity later.) Orwas it the insanely 568th zoom-in/close up of the both the actors, namely Mr. Initforthemoney Neill, and the dinosaurs?Mercifully, the movie's only attribute was its 92 minute length. After you get past that sigh of relief and the regret of wasting those precious 92 minutes knowing all well you shouldn't have returned to the island with Mr. Spiralingdowncareer Neill, you have silly people running around doing and saying silly things making you wonder why this wasn't rated G. Heck, it was basically animated with some of the dinosaurs. Some that even talk!And what's worse? A character that vows never to step into the land of the lost-scripts, but sells out with the deposit of a check or an actor that does the same? What's that old phrase: Fool me oncewell, Alan (Neill) did make this very same mistake in JP1 but you'll have to forgive him: though he was offered money, he was tricked onto the island of the dinos. Here, he, wellwas offered money and was tricked onto the island of the dinos. How does someone of such idiocy become a doctor?I digress, he isn't real and this just further proof of poor screenplay writing – and from three different men, one of which I WILL NOT forgive: Alexander Payne, author of excellent movies such as Election and Sideways.And speaking of poorly written Part IIIs, I'm sure it's already been stated this is the Jaws 3D of our generation with the coincidence of Spielberg directing both part ones of the series mentioned. Thankfully, in 2001, the 3D re-trend hadn't begun yet, so I can imagine this movie actually could've been worse with the use of 3D. Though they certainly tried towith all those damned close-ups.I have NOT seen so many close ups in my life. Back in 2001, when I saw this movie for the first (of now only two) time(s), I saw it with a buddy friend of mine. We laughed our asses off throughout – yeah, laughing at it, but one of the things that were hilarious, though annoying, were the zoom in creatures, including the actors. This occurs roughly every 2-3, maybe 5, minutes of screen time. The last straw towards the ending when my friend wanted to put his fist through a wall: in the fiftieth time they showed off their graphics of the dinos, the scene was set-up and was, once again another zoom in on one of the creatures. My buddy saw it coming and he warned me: if theyif they do it Of course, we always had the same response of whenever they did: we would say to each other ""Alan?"" as in the first of many horrid scenes towards the beginning when a raptor speaks Alan's name to himon an airplane.Anyways, I better seal off this review, though I am happy now that I've seen it, it's fresher in my mind to review it and now I never, ever have to see it again. The BASIC plot is idiot male takes Erik (Trevor Morgan, a.k.a. Jungle-Boy) on a ""Dino-Soar"" expedition of the restricted island of dinosaurs left vacant (of humans, supposedly) from JP2. Inevitably, they crash onto the island.In comes Mommy & Daddy, too inept to barely walk and chew at the same time yelling out idiot lines and gestures. They hire sell-out Alan to ""just fly"" over the island, but in reality, they're there to get back their son who's been gone for two months. Literally, after the AGAIN inevitable crash the movie turns to some odd-ball screw-ball comedy with all-but zero original ideas of how to now use the dinosaurs on screen.ThenJust when you thought it was safe towait, let me start overJust when you thought JP3 couldn't get any worse, in comes Jungle-Boy to the rescue. And let's give him some credit: he is one humble kid. After incredibly surviving eight weeks without training, adequate supplies, company, help or hope, his first concern when found: ""Golly gee wilikers, I hope mom and dad are getting along!""He swoops in (believe me, this had me and my buddy roaring in laughter in the theatre), saves Alan from the seventh near-death situation, who promptly has a very nice and calm conversation about Alan's books (again, see JP1), about how mommy & daddy are getting along while Alan unforgivingly eats the kid's precious final food scraps.At any rate, this leads to that, that leads to more of the same and the conclusion will have you, for the umpteenth time laughing out loud.Just skip the throw-away JP3. Unless you're a filmmaker and want examples of what not to do to ruin a highly successful franchise.",Jurassic Park III
42,bensonmum2,"""I rescued your hat.""",5,7 May 2020,"With the promise of badly needed funding for his research, Dr. Alan Grant agrees to act as a sightseeing guide in a fly over of Isla Sorna. But the couple who've hired Dr. Grant haven't told him the whole truth. Their plan involves more than just a bird's-eye view of the island. Before he realizes he's been tricked, Dr. Grant finds himself once again fighting for his life in a world where dinosaurs rule.As I think about the things I like and dislike about Jurassic Park III (JPIII for the rest of this), the dislike list is much easier to put together. There are so many things one could pick at in JPIII that I could probably write pages. The laundry list would go something like this: 1. The notion that young Billy could survive on the island alone for 8 weeks, yet we've seen trained mercenaries and survivalists that don't last an afternoon. 2. A talking raptor. 3. The idea that the supposedly intelligent, but vicious raptors would so easily fall for a simple trick and not just rip the heads off the humans. 4. That idiotic ringing satellite phone. 5. Set-pieces strung together without much connecting them. 6. Anyone who for a second would believe that Michael Jeter's character is what he claims to be. 7. Not enough Laura Dern. 8. All the insipid melodrama involving Billy's parents. 9. Cringe-inducing dialogue. 10. That way over-the-top and completely ridiculous ending.As I stated previously, there are things about JPIII that I like. Here's that list: 1. It's a big, dumb action movie with plenty of dinosaurs, including the new Pteredons. 2. Well . . . uh . . . that's about it.To be fair, though, any sequel to the original Jurassic Park was going to have a tough time in comparison. That film is near perfect. So, in the end, even though my list of what I dislike about JPIII is much longer than my list of what I like, I think the 5/10 rating is about right. Despite the many faults, there's still some degree of entertainment to be had..5/10",Jurassic Park III

'Jurassic Park III (2001)' isn't graced with the behind-the-scenes talent of its predecessors, though, and this omission really shows. It isn't necessarily the visual believability of its cretaceous creations that takes a hit, but rather the competence of the overall craft. The direction is decent but uninspired and often marred by odd choices such as obvious and distracting speed-ramping. The story takes a hit, too, because, while it is somewhat of an intriguing concept to set a rescue mission on a dinosaur-infested island and have it essentially be divorced from the events of the former films, the themes that make the picture's underlying concept inherently interesting are all but gone. Instead, they are replaced by vapid characters going through the motions of a standard 'survival' plot that might as well be set amongst regular jungle predators. It's in this entry that the suspense starts to seep out in favour of soulless spectacle. It's clear that the picture prefers to pit two dinosaurs against one another simply because that's 'cool'. Because of this, there's little exciting in the entire piece despite the fact that there's barely a moment to spare. The pacing doesn't feel taut, it feels rushed and the same can be said of every aspect. There didn't seem to be a reason for making this movie other than money and, as always, that's a sure-fire way to make the worst entry in your franchise thus far. 5/10",Jurassic Park III
45,dromasca,Exactly What You Expect,7,7 May 2003,"JP-III delivers exactly what you would expect. The third in the series does not invent anything new, neither in effects, not in the way reptiles and humans relate. Everything is in place - some humor, some family relations syrup, some new effects well done and not too scary. Predictability is the main quality and the main defect of the movie. It is however well made and never falls in the ridicule or bad taste - this may be the effect of the adult supervision of producer Spielberg. If you know that you go to a dinosaurs movie, and do not expect anything else, you may even enjoy it. 7/10 on my personal scale.",Jurassic Park III

This time around, Alan Grant heads to Isla Sorna. He was originally told by a family(Kirby) that they needed him as an expert. But when they land, Grant and his sidekick, Billy are told they were needed because the Kirby's son is lost. Now they must evade the new, evil dinosaurs to head to safety without being eaten by the dinosaurs. As I said before, the dinosaurs are better. I noticed that they all have the same red stripes on their body. I liked the dinosaur birds the most. The one thing that did bother me is the length. The time does not even surpass an hour and a half. That means the story was not explained well as it should've been. The music is better than the last film. More of William's original themes can be heard throughout the movie. Don Davis added more great music. Everything else regarding this movie is pretty darn good.

47,lesleyharris30,"An Improvement from Lost World, but still Nowhere near as Entertaining as the Original,",7,14 June 2015,"Jurassic Park III is a good movie with a well written storyline and a decent cast. It's probably an unpopular opinion, but i preferred this movie from the Lost World: Jurassic Park, Alan Grant was one of my favourite characters from the original movie and seeing him again was a huge bonus for me, I found myself caring more for these characters, and one of my biggest problems with Lost World was that a lot of the actors weren't believable, they didn't seem like they were witnessing a real dinosaur, I feel like they accomplished that here. I think Paul and Amanda Kirby's characters were poorly written, though I do like William H. Macy and Téa Leoni's performances, they were just very strange, it didn't feel necessary to make their personality so weird and it took is away from the main part of the movie, the dinosaurs, because of how mysterious they were, also the opening scene with their son was crudely executed. The problem with the Lost World is still very much evident here, and that's simply that they're trying too hard to be as good as the original Jurassic Park and not simply being its own movie, if it would stop making reference to the first and reminding us how much better that movie was, then the series would be going on the right track. It has many shortcomings and it may be another inadequate Jurassic Park sequel, but Jurassic Park III is very fun to watch, and I would recommend it you ever see it on television, Netflix, etc., and have some time to kill.

48,CuriosityKilledShawn,Should have been more than an underrated potboiler,6,7 August 2010,"Spielberg bailed. He was too busy bringing AI: Artificial Intelligence to the screen. Joe Johnston, a more than capable director himself, stepped in delivered a decent timewaster, but failed to give us anything new and didn't even bother to attempt an epic.Above and beyond all things, what cripples Jurassic Park 3 the most is the brief running time. The film fades out at the 84-minute mark, which is just unacceptable. The previous films were epics and both clocked in at over 2 hours. Why on earth did Universal take their biggest franchise at the time and cut it down to this? It beggars belief. The film feels like a TV pilot more than it does a cinematic event.Strange since the budget was $30 million higher than Jurassic Park in 1993. But the effects have improved drastically in that 8 year gap. I was never too keen or impressed with the CGI in the first film. The dinosaurs just didn't look right, but if you dared to criticize the film at the time you would have been shouted down.A lot of story concepts came and went before they, unimaginatively, settled on a ""same again"" scenario with yet another extended chase on Isla Sorna. Some of the scenes are even recycled unused sequences that never made the final script edit in the first two. At least they brought back Sam Neill as Alan Grant and had a small role for Laura Dern. William H. Macy provides great support too. It's good to see him do action for a change. And the kid in this one is far, far, far less aggravating than those annoying brats in the original film.John Williams didn't return, instead leaving the scoring chore Don Davis who made an adequate, if hardly memorable, attempt. All the good stuff is Williams' themes from the other movies. And since he made a few themes for this one I will assume that any noteworthy cues within were actually Williams' contributions, and not Davis', who I have never really liked.The action IS brilliantly done though, and the Spinosaurus, the new villain is quite scary. But just as it builds up to a big showdown,the film just...stops. What were they thinking? There's no payoff, no defining money shot. It just ends! That is my biggest problem with JP3. The familiar plot, and the lack of originality are forgivable, but rolling the credits at 84 minutes is a joke.I still recommend it for the action, sound design and effects alone.",Jurassic Park III

Here we are in the worst place in the world, and we're not even getting paid' quotes, Dr. Alan Grant (Sam Neill) in this movie. I feel your pain, Dr. Grant. I don't want to be, here, too. I really didn't like 'Jurassic Park III' that much. No amount of money, would force me to give this movie, a 'good' review. It was awful. Hold onto your butts. I will tell you, why! Directed by Joe Johnston, the film suffers from some of the same problems of 1997's 'Lost World: Jurassic Park' had. While, both sequels to 1993's 'Jurassic Park' have full of nonstop action, gore, and violence. Only one of them, try to do something new with the franchise, by introducing the unique idea of having the dinosaurs wrecking the main land. 'Jurassic Park III' chose to do nearly nothing new, with the concept, instead, choosing to laziness rely on highly generic clichés plot, in which, a bunch of idiotic tourists get stuck on a restricted island, while a rescue mission is set up. The only thing, I can praise them, about the story, is how they introduce new deadly dinosaurs to attack the group. However, the three writers, Peter Buchman, Alexander Payne & Jim Taylor, kinda screw that up, by offending fans, that their creatures were better than the ones, they saw in the original movie. Personally, I have no problem with that approach, but the misdirection was a disaster in marketing as fans weren't biting on the idea of having the iconic T-Rex replace by Spinosaurus. In my opinion, while the Spinosaurus, indeed, look menacing, I dislike how the creature, act less than an animal feeding on primitive survival instinct, but more like a serial killer with a grudge. It's the same problem, I had, against the new creature that they introduce in 2015's 'Jurassic World'. Carnivore creatures, living in the wild, normally don't track that way, as they would be, wasting too much, energy, attacking beings that doesn't have the protein & essential nutrients requirements for their metabolisms. More likely, they would had hunt and store the fats of bigger game. Plus, aren't the creatures not supplied with lysine. Shouldn't they slip into a comma and die with how small and weak, their bodies are. I guess, life indeed found a way. Yet, the CGI effects for the dinosaurs were a little weak. It didn't really look, like they were, really there. Nor, were they really that scary. Although, the action scenes with the dinosaurs was fine. It did leave some questions, like how does a giant creature be able to sneak, and how raptor can understand broken language from a raptor larynx. It was jarring. Despite that, I just couldn't get behind with most of the new characters in these action moments. They weren't that interesting. Don't get me wrong, Eric Kirby (Trevor Morgan) was probably the most unique, out of the bunch, but the other characters were just horrible. The new characters would often die from minimal damage, run ahead into danger, or step into other characters's line of fire. Otherwise act, too dumb to live. Trust me, characters like Paul (William H. Macy) & Amanda (Téa Leoni) will make you wish, they get eaten by a dinosaur, as soon as they're introduce in the film. Not only are they kinda ruin the film, by how much, Dr. Grant has to babysit them, but their artificial fakeness style of acting is below standards. I saw better work from them, in other action survival movies like 1997's 'Deep Impact' or 1996's 'Andersonville'. The acting, we got here, from both of them was pathetic. Thank God, Sam Neill was better, if even he wasn't giving this role, his all. Neill seem a bit tiresome. Still, his presence as Dr. Grant or this movie made the movie, watchable. However, I didn't like what they did to the character. Not seeing him, with Dr. Ellie Sattler (Laura Dern), really does under minded the positive message about family from the first movie. Personally my biggest complain about this movie, is the ending. Without spoiling it, too much, I really do hate it. What is with the whimsy music!? How are the ending with the flying pteranodons, good? After all, we seems the damage, a few of them has on boats in the beginning. So, why is it uplifting, to see a squadron of them, flying toward the main land, movie!? Also, why isn't the military, shooting them down?! In better note, why was the military sent in, now, and not before? You would think, a dangerous area, where dinosaurs rules, would had a military presences, beforehand, just in case, dumb tourists or worst, terrorists try to use them as a weapon! After all, the military follow the ship with the T-Rex in the last movie. So, where did they disappear to, and how do you appear, so quickly on a deserted beach? Also, why would they send a long man in a suit, first!? This movie makes no damn sense. As much, as director Steven Spielberg's follow up to his blockbuster hit, 1993's 'Jurassic Park' might be mediocre to some people. At least, 1997's 'The Lost World: Jurassic Park' was nowhere near as bad, as this movie. No wonder, why the sequel to this movie was stuck in development hell for 14 years. Overall: While, the movie has fast pacing, redeemable quotes and an alright soundtrack by composter, Don Davis. Like the movie said in the beginning. Everything about this was just a bad idea. Can't recommended. Just watch, 'Lost World: Jurassic Park' or 'Jurassic World', instead.",Jurassic Park III
52,The-Sarkologist,More Dino Porn,5,10 May 2020,"This is another one of those films that I sort of missed when it hit the shelves, but that probably has quite a lot to do with it basically being number three, and normally when you have a film appended with the number three, in most cases it is basically ignored. Then again, when it was released, I wasn't really going out watching movies anyway, though I doubt I would have made an effort to charge down to the cinemas for this one in any case.Yeah, it is pretty much like all of the other films in the franchise, and that is basically spending all of the time running away for nasty dinosaurs, while also making an effort to be amazed at the more placid ones, but that is basically only a small part of the movie because it is really the big and nasty dinosaurs that people come to see.However, this one is sort of a little different, though not much, namely because the plot is one of those plots that have been used many times in the past, though of course it probably wouldn't have worked as well if it was the first, or even the second, film, namely due to the back story that was required. So, this boy is out with his step Dad going for a dino cruise around one of the islands, when the boat that they are paragliding from crashes, and they cut the cords and go soaring into the island. So, their mother and father, rather deceitfully mind you, convince Dr Grant to take them to the island to get him back.Yeah, you can basically guess what happens from there - dinosaurs, and of course raptors. Mind you, the film opens with Grant giving a lecture about raptors, so you can expect that the stuff that he is talking about ends up happening in the film, namely that the raptors tend to be the most intelligent of the dinosaurs, and thus you sort of have them interacting with the characters, though not on the same scale that you tend to have them interacting in the other films.Look, I didn't think this one was particularly all that bad. It was enjoyable, but it certainly wasn't one of the best ones that I've seen. Then again, I haven't been a particularly big fan of the franchise, it is just that after some friends decided to have a movie night, where the first one was the movie being shown, that I would make an effort to watch the other ones in the franchise, especially since there isn't all that much else to do at the moment.",Jurassic Park III

But this one is scarier. This is one of the scariest movie made before 2015. Jurassic world is scarier. But still this is the scariest movie from the last decade. See all the Jurassic Park movies they are some of the best scenes fiction movies of all time. This movie has a great story line. It also has great acting. It also has great special effects.

54,paulclaassen,Kids might enjoy this...,2,16 August 2021,"Whatever besieged Sam Neill (or his agent) for agreeing to do 'Jurassic Park 3' is a mystery to me. The script alone should have prevented him from signing the contract...So, when did 'Jurassic Park' become a comedy? Oh, and apparently, this is not the same island... there was another island next to the original one.... When did this happen, and why was this never mentioned in the first film?Plot wise the film is about a kid, Eric, who goes on a parasailing adventure with a friend near the island, and then disappears. (No further mention about his friend who was with him when he disappeared is ever made. No one seems to cares about him). So, Eric's parents, Paul and Amanda Kirby, hire Dr Grant (Sam Neill) under false pretentions to escort them to the island. Off course, fate intervenes and no sooner had they arrived than they're stranded on the island. What follows is a comical telling of a handful of people trying to outrun and outwit dinosaurs.This film offers nothing new to the franchise. On the contrary, it suffers from poor storytelling, poor directing, silly dialogue, uninteresting characters and mediocre visuals. The dinosaurs look like children's toys photographed to make them look bigger. Nothing here looks or felt realistic. No thanks to all the humor and stocky dinosaurs, there's not an inch of suspense. This plays more like a spoof of 'Jurassic Park'. They even attempted to duplicate some of the scenes from the original 'Jurassic Park', but to little effect, and very poorly done. The magic is gone. 'Jurassic Park 3' will appeal to a young demographic, who likes dinosaurs. Yup, I believe this to be for kids...",Jurassic Park III
55,tomgillespie2002,Seems like a pointless exercise,4,29 October 2015,"It became apparent rather quickly during my first viewing of The Lost World: Jurassic Park in 1997 that even an old master like Steven Spielberg was lacking ideas for the follow-up to his 1993 smash. So it comes as no surprise that director Joe Johnston, whose most popular work back in 2001 consisted of mediocre fare like Honey, I Shrunk The Kids (1989) and Jumanji (1995), failed to squeeze any life out of the extinct prehistoric monsters on show. Even the writing talents of Oscar-winners Alexander Payne and Jim Taylor - who co-scripted with Peter Buchman - struggle to bring any dimension to the film's ensemble of disposable characters.When their son Eric (Trevor Morgan) goes missing while para-sailing near to the dino-infested island of Isla Sorna, his wealthy parents Paul (William H. Macy) and Amanda (Tea Leoni) look to launching their own rescue mission. As their guide, they approach Dr. Alan Grant (Sam Neill), one of the survivors from the events of Jurassic Park, to whom they offer a big pay-cheque and the promise that their plane will not touch ground. Paul and Amanda have some explaining to do when they inevitably land on the island and are soon running for their lives from a hungry spinosaurus. The velociraptors have also become more intelligent, learning to vocally communicate with each other, and do not respond nicely when Grant's assistant Billy (Alessandro Nivola) steals one of their eggs.It's no surprise that the franchise stagnated for 14 years following this third instalment. Little more than a re-hash of the first two movies - characters scream, run, get eaten, and make stupid decisions, while the true stars, the dinosaurs themselves, still impress. There's little pity to be had for the characters as we are urged to accept that Paul and Amanda would let their young son adventure near to an island now famously inhabited by ravenous monsters, and then ignore every piece of advice offered to them by the expert they employed. Even Sam Neill sleepwalks his lines and fails to bring any life to Dr. Grant. It all just seems like a pointless exercise, like everyone involved were simply seeking a nice pay day, and any ethical questions raised in the first two films are ignored in favour of somehow squeezing in yet another dinosaur attack.",Jurassic Park III

Bonus Video comment below!,10,11 August 2001,"When I was in the theater I was expecting to see Isla Sorna,the return of Dr.Grant,a cameo by Laura Dern,new and old Dinosaurs,Raptiors being more intelligent,lots of action,and The Spinosaur in action!I wasn't a bit disappointed.There were a lot of familiar dinos and there were new ones in the movie as well.There's to many to name but the Allosaurs finally makes his debut and the Terradons(the flying dinos)have a large part as well.The acting was good.Sam Neil is good as always, Tea Leoni acts her role just fine,and William H Macy is good,Alessandro Nivola is good,and Michael Jeter is good and Laura Dern is pretty good but the real star of Jurassic Park /// is the Spinosaur!Wow.This dinosaur is huge!He is bigger than the T.Rex believe it or not.He has bigger arms,a longer snout like a crocodile,a fin on his massive back and huge feet.His teeth must have been 10 inches! Watch out for the big fight between the a T.Rex and the Spinosaur!Talk about clash of the Titans! I just couldn't believe when I saw these two behemoths fight each other.I thought this huge fight was really neat.There hasn't been something like that in a movie in quite some time.You can tell the movie is directed by Joe Johnson and not Steven Spielberg but Johnson did a good job.The music is great.Its composed by Don Davis,the premier movie music composer.The JP themes composed by the legendary John Williams are there so everything is just right with the music.Many people complain since JP 1 & JP 2 were over four hours combined that JP 3 is only an hour and a half.To tell ya the truth it seemed a lot longer than that.The time factor is not a problem here.It was a bit different not seeing Richard Attenborough and Jeff Goldblum in this one.I guess there was a reason for them not being in it,I don't know but other than that Jurassic Park 3 is a very good,pleasing dinosaur movie.This is one of the best movies to come out this year and that I have seen so far.The others I recommend is The Mummy Returns and The Planet Of The Apes.I give JP /// **** out of ****!Notes: When they are in the bar,listen for Randy Newman's song,Big Hat,No Cattle play in the background,I just flipped when I heard it.Look for some variation on some raptors.Some has various colors and top notches on their heads.Another thing when you read about people talking about the raptors speaking.Their not,they are communicating with each other,not talking like we do,I'D thought just I'D clear that up.Movie Nuttball's NOTE:I won't tell ya what the ending is but it isn't bad.I don't know what it was but when I saw Jurassic Park 3 at a AMC Theatre,Everyone was coughing,it seemed like it was the pop corn.I don't know.Is all I know is that it was strange.Maybe its a sign that Jurassic Park IV is coming soon!Let's hope so,I can't wait:)I rented Jurassic Park /// and I watch three times and I enjoyed every minute of it and then bought it! I love this movie more than ever now!The Direction of the film is very good and the special effects are superb.It was excellent when I saw this in the theater.I respect this movie more now sinceI have seen it more than once.I love the parts where Cooper and Nash and going to blow up the air plane.Another great part is when cooper goes into the jungle and attack the awesome Spinosaurus and everything goes haywire.Ooohh and I love the Spinosarus' roar!This is arguably the best of the Jurassic Park trilogy.I don't know what the big problem is why people don't like this great movie.This is one of the three movies that should have ruled the box office in MY opinion.The other two are The Mummy Returns and The Planet Of The Apes.Make sure you get all of the great action figures of Jurassic Park /// by Hasbro.",Jurassic Park III
57,Thanos_Alfie,The third of Jurassic...,6,23 February 2014,"""Jurassic Park III"" is the third movie of Jurassic Park and in this one we have a couple which convince Dr. Alan Grant to go to the second island of Jurassic Park B but there he will understand that the reason was something else and the inhabitants of the island are not very friendly with them.I liked this movie but not as much as the previous two movies of Jurassic Park. In this movie the story continues and the connection between the previous two movies and this one are not as tight as the two previous movies were together. I also believe that the interpretation of Sam Neill who plays as Dr. Alan Grant was really good but not enough. Another good interpretations made by William H. Macy who plays as Paul Kirby and Trevor Morgan who played as Eric Kirby.Finally I have to tell you that ""Jurassic Park III"" is a really nice movie but not as good as the previous two. Although I recommend this movie and I believe that every fan of Jurassic Park will like this movie.",Jurassic Park III
58,zkonedog,Great Concept Carries Average Script,6,11 March 2017,"After the brainless, though very shiny and full of action, ""Lost World"", the caretakers of this series (including one Steven Spielberg) decided to ""end"" the franchise without having a T-Rex loose in a metropolitan area. Though not without a few hiccups, they by and large succeeded in righting the ship and creating a solid effort.For a basic plot summary, ""Jurassic Park III"" sees Dr. Alan Grant (Sam Neil) getting duped into landing on Isla Sorna (the experimental island from ""Lost World"") by a divorced couple (William H. Macy & Tea Leoni) looking for their lost son. Dinosauric action/adventure ensues.At face value, the plot and themes of this film are quite shallow and contrived. Yet, character and plot themes actually DO exist, giving it one leg up on its immediate predecessor. The Macy and Leoni characters are often annoying and don't really provide the emotional payoff you hope for in the end, while Dr. Grant's is quite a bit different than he portrayed in the original. Also, the plot itself isn't anything overly dramatic, and really does nothing to drive the film along.Here's the thing, though: A film like this only needed the basics of plot and character development, because those dinosaurs are just so doggone incredible! No matter how many times you see them, there is just something about dinos that stir the imagination. When the air goes silent, the ground begins to shake, or the grass begins to rustle, you can't help but break out in gooseflesh in anticipation of what might happen next. The epic John Williams score only helps matters.Thus, ""Jurassic Park III"", though not the magnificent achievement of the original by any means, is much more solid (if a little less flashy) than the second installment. Put it this way: If the rumors about a Jurassic Park IV finally being produce prove to be true in the near future, it is a movie that I will definitely be checking out.",Jurassic Park III
59,johnnyboyz,"Although refreshingly providing more of what was in the first and less of what was in the second, the film falls between the pair of them.",6,11 March 2012,"Jurassic Park III is the Jurassic Park movie as made by the director of Jumanji. In saying as such, we mean to point out that rather than enchanted monkeys on motorbikes popping up here and there to cause strife, Raptors capable of educated guesses are the ingredients; rather than late-19th Century Big Game hunter Van Pelt appearing here and there for the odd skirmish, an extraordinarily large dinosaur in the form of a Spinosaurus comes along at varying times to cause havoc and serious damage. The first one worked well as a pot boiling thriller, especially when all the electronics went off and we essentially saw mankind stripped bare of its modernity thus thrust back into a primitive state of existence wherein it was forced into confronting a very real, albeit prehistoric, threat of dinosaurs. Toss in an ample slice of characterisation involving its lead and his forced exposure to dealing with his pet hate, that of kids, as well as having to battle against a would-be romance between an apparent rival and the woman he's dating, and you had something which worked to a decent level on the array of strands it headed down.The second veered off and away from the beaten path too much and for too long to actually enjoy, with the third bringing it right back down to Earth in its providing a director, in Joe Johnston, whose ability to deal with causality driven monsters/beasties/threats/episodic chaos is proved, sees him do the business with a film set on a tropical dystopia following an array of people ill equipped to deal with what they're facing. There are no superfluous company-come-conglomerates takeover sub plots; there are no city-set Godzilla homages, nor indeed are there too many characters to get busy depicting.As was with the second film, we open with a child and their relative where they ought not be – enjoying themselves in the vicinity of a dinosaur infested island somewhere in Central America. Here is the, by now, obligatory sequence featuring the dinosaurs misbehaving at the bereft of a bystander; the film's first instance of it neatly syncing up with 1993's Jurassic Park in its refusing to show the beasts but getting across their threat via a young boy named Erik (Morgan) and his foster-father's illegal parasailing ride over restricted waters. The ride goes wrong, and both Erik and the guardian end up crash landing on the nearby island populated by the very dinosaurs they sought to catch a glimpse of whilst riding high in the skies. Cut to a number of weeks later, and Sam Neill's Alan Grant is still good friends with Laura Dern's character from the first film. Neill makes a welcome return as the film's lead; as its anchorman, his low tone and worn features pleasingly replacing that of Goldblum's sardonic put-downs; monosyllabic understatements and generally neurotic presence driving the last.Grant is the ""last of his dying breed"", and continues to dig for fossils as well as speak publicly on an array of issues linked to his practise, in spite of the fact events from the first two films dog his career reiterating a real resentment to what he was caught up in. With money to fund these digs and fossil extractions in short supply, enter William H. Macy's businessman Paul Kirby, with his wife Amanda (Leoni) in tow, and a proposition which would see Grant come out with a large cash sum if he were to take them close to where that Central American island from the first dinosaurs are.Things take a change for the worse from here on in, with ulterior motives possessed by the Kirby's and their mercenaries becoming clearer – one question we ask ourselves is as to why the Kirby's appear to take Grant out in the evening, with the proposition in mind, to a seedy looking pool hall/diner bar establishment when they're seemingly a lot richer. The party of around half a dozen, as well as Alessandro Nivola's character Billy - a good friend of Grant's, end up stranded on an island once upon a time more inclined to dinosaurs as a means of experimentation than entertainment; an array of new beasts and improved older ones propping up the means for conflict. Trueer intentions for being there rear up in the form of the reveal that Erik is the Kirby's son, Grant more interested in getting off the island and home than anything else but there is room for meagre characterisation in the form of the fact the Kirby's are actually estranged and here find time to get back together; Billy gets a shot at redemption after he makes some poor decisions of his own and there is pleasing room for Grant to revisit his child orientated prejudices from the first film when he gets to bond with Erik before anyone else and discovers what good company he actually is.The film is ultimately mere spectacle, something driven by an engine of episodic causality and often fun action. Much was once made of the Spinosaurus – I recall DVD extras going on and on at length about its design; the thing a huge dinosaur unlike any other and the chief foil to that of the characters getting away safely. There is a poignant early instance of the Spinosaurus coming face to face with and fighting the T-Rex, with the 2001 vintage eventually overcoming both the classes of '93 and'97; but is the film any better because of the Spinosaurus' presence? Would it be any better or worse had it just been the T-Rex popping up here and there like before? Irregardless, dressing up old models is the farthest one feels one can go in criticising it because it is a good, clean honest crack and is difficult to get as riled about as one did about The Lost World.",Jurassic Park III
60,filipemanuelneto,Far-fetched and ridiculous.,2,5 September 2015,"Its the third film of the ""Jurassic Park"" saga and tells the return of Alan Grant to Isla Sorna, of the second film, and that Alan never have thought to visit again in his life. He eventually returns, convinced by a couple who hides her true intent with that trip: to rescue a child who was lost on the island.Its the only film in this franchise that has not been directed by Steven Spielberg, one noted and notable absence throughout the film, which reveals itself, scene after scene, increasingly far-fetched and unbelievable, to the point of becoming absolutely ridiculous and we almost wish all end up devoured by dinosaurs. The director, Joe Johnston, proved that he only serves to direct comedies (is the director of ""Jumanji"" and ""Honey, I Shrunk the Kids""). The script is a shame and looks more like a parody of Spielberg's movies than something that we should take seriously. The characters are totally improbable, and who saw the first movies will never believe that a child can survive with such dangerous animals more than two or three days. The only positive note is the performance of Sam Neill, lending talent to a film that should have been lost in the bowels of the dinosaurs he portrays before coming to our homes.",Jurassic Park III
61,leplatypus,Hungry again (DVD),7,27 May 2011,"After the flop of ""lost world"", this franchise could have been dead all the more than dinos movies are limited by nature: as Malcom said, it's ending always with screaming and running.But here, things get straighten up from the lost movie. The cast is better: Grant and Ellie are back, Leoni and Macy are cool. the story is close to the main theme of the ""Lost world"" (a rescue mission) and for one time, the dinos are seen in plain daylight and not mere shadows in a rainy night. in addition, they aren't reduced to running stomachs as in the last movie but depicted as animals with behaviors! The jungle is beautiful, full of colors. Another good point is that the special effects are really over the top and kept improving after each movie.I first watched this movie in Bruxelles (2002) at a Sunday afternoon movies for kids and nearly ten years after, the pleasure is still there.

64,jzappa,A Compulsory and Artificial Cash-In,6,14 February 2011,"Michael Crichton's cautionary saga of humanity's unchecked biological trifling had by this time unashamedly entered the flat surface of bluntly revenue-chasing amusement, the same region that the Rocky, Nightmare on Elm Street, Friday the 13th and other trademark blockbusters came to fill as original casts and directors began their mass-migration to other ventures. Having accumulated some box-office cred on Jumanji, about a splintered family fleeing from feral animals, this one film in the series that's neither directed by Spielberg nor based on a book by Crichton indicates a sensible manufacture within the thin function of director Joe Johnston's specialty. The idea of human characters has been substituted practically by folding-carton patterns, each of which performs either of two functions: to escape from dinosaurs or to be consumed by them. When you think about it, that essentially means there's no need at all for human actors.The initial Jurassic Park was a tour de force of suspense and adventure sheathed in a thrilling present that employed vanguard visual effects and digital sound to totally convince us that dinosaurs could exist afresh. The Lost World, though disparaged by some, essentially streamlined the crisply paced action and adventure, just as Jaws 2 did for its Spielberg-helmed predecessor. But somewhat like that sequel's shameful cash-in descendants, this numbly entertaining film simply repeats the basic gimmick with far less technique and human interest. Here, there's no upsurge to the first emergence of the dinosaurs, they're abruptly there. Character interface is shoddier than obligatory, it's, to all intents and purposes, absent. Each action set-piece is presented in a standard way, leaving no scope for anxiety or dread, not to mention any that even comes close to the Jeep sequence in the first film, for instance. And the entire thing is over so quickly that it barely feels as if to have been experienced.The story, to the degree that there is one, has paleontologist Dr. Grant reluctantly voyaging to Isla Sorna as the salaried guide for William H. Macy and Téa Leoni, an alienated couple hunting for their son, who's disappeared there. Grant, along with his protégé, Alessandro Nivola, almost immediately find himself in the unchanged sort of life-and-death predicament as the last time he was here, being pursued by Raptors, Tyrannosaurus, and the new Spinosaurus. Also along for the jaunt are Michael Jeter and John Diehl, who virtually have ""Expendable Character Actor"" outlined on sandwich boards.It's poignant to find that the most skillful scene, a reunion between Grant and his past subordinate, Laura Dern in a cameo, involves no actual dinosaurs. All that happens on Isla Sorna is cyclical and mainly dull, barring the sporadic bald reference to classic Spielberg films, which is also rather sad. There are some fresh dinosaurs at the table, some airborne, though they work to the same effect as all the others. The raptors have been promoted to Ubermensch level: They now consult one another, though not in English; I was imagining subtitles. In the meantime our first love, the T-Rex, has but a fleeting, base cameo. The effects, while basically convincing, appear to have been done at a bargain price: Some of the dinosaurs, even some of the new ones, are visibly less refined and worse, transparently CGI.This children's slasher flick, this computer-game-and-action-figure promo, lacks a genuine high point. It more or less finishes with a cumbersome, economical lack of creativity where conflict is rapidly and gruffly worked out with the manufactured intervention of running time rations. This is in proportion to the film's largely mediocre arrangement. The movie unproductively fantasizes about reproducing the human interaction of the first movie: a modest romance and an adult-child friendship. In this case, though, it's compulsory and artificial.The filmmakers transparently trusted that reprising Sam Neill would contribute a flavor of authenticity to this production that it might not otherwise have had. And, to offer him scaffolding, they've contrived a troupe of first-rate character actors. Nevertheless, since the characters are so weakly written, no sum of ability or familiarity can matter. Considering the bits and pieces he has to ply, they can be pardoned. It was almost certainly silly to look forward to something fresh or innovative to emerge in Jurassic Park III anyway. On balance, the modus operandi has long been set up for this variety of cinema, though it shouldn't have been excessive to anticipate at least a fraction of excitement comparable at all to that of the prior two films.",Jurassic Park III
65,taylorkingston,Meh...,8,10 June 2015,"I can sum up my feelings about this movie in one word: Meh. While it's good at some points of the movie, overall it's very disappointing. I feel like they should've stopped making this trilogy before there was even a sequel, although The Lost World isn't too bad. I feel like this movie tried to hard. Now, eight years after the events of The Lost World, Dr. Grant is happy with his life far away from living, breathing dinosaurs. But when events lead him to have to go back and have an adventure that he didn't want to have, things get serious.Best part of the movie: Sadly, the credits, because you know it's over.Worst part of the movie: I can't pick, that's how ""meh"" it was.Overall, I give this movie a 4 out of 10, which in my ratings book is: Kinda sucks.",Jurassic Park III
66,FiendishDramaturgy,Inferior but not unenjoyable,7,30 September 2003,"Well, I don't know what I expected, but this was not it. One of the primary elements which made the first two movies so successful was the high level of suspense that Spielberg devoted to them. I did a little research on Joe Johnston, the director, and could have smacked myself for expecting more. Although I am a serious Robin Williams fan, I absolutely detested ""Jumanji"" and he directed that, too. Go figure.Although Dr. Allen Grant is brought back for this third installment, the other principal characters are portrayed by William H. Macy and Téa Leoni (as Paul and Amanda Kirby). I liked neither of their characters, and Téa Leoni was stiff and appeared to be a living stop-motion character. William H. Macy was adequate as a duplicitious man with ulterior motives.There were some good elements in this sequel; it was fun to watch and still held a sort of morbid fascination, but the story was of the mainstream popcorn variation and I found it lacking for that reason, principally. The Kirby's kidnap Alan Grant and take him to the second dinosaur-laden island in order to obtain his assistance in saving their son, Erik, who has become stranded on that island. I hated the mainstream addition of the kid. Why do that? They had 2 kids in the first movie, and brought in Malcolm's daughter in the second. Why keep dragging kids onto these islands? It does nothing to help the franchise. Ironically, Sam Neill and Trevor Morgan (as Erik Kirby) were the bright and shining stars in this installment. There is a new dinosaur, one larger than the T-Rex, whose addition to the second island was a complete and total mystery due to the fact that the second installment (The Lost World) supposedly took place on this same island, and this new dinosaur was not present. He was instead ... what? Off watching ""Friends?"" The CGI quality in this production was decent, though I detested the addition of feathers to the heads of the raptors. Let science hang! I liked the raptors as they WERE! But I did like the inclusion of pterodons. I have been expecting to see them since the first installment.The best line in the movie? ""I rescued your hat!"" delivered by Alessandro Nivola as Billy Brennan.It's sad to say, but the hat is the real star of Jurassic Park 3. I still found it mildly entertaining to watch. I don't have the slightest idea why, but it was still somehow...amusing even though it totally lacked the charm and edge of the first two.I look forward with great anticipation to Jurassic Park 4 (even considering the detested feather factor) and were it the Fiend's perfect world, Spielberg would be back to direct it.It gets a 7.3/10 from...the Fiend :.",Jurassic Park III
67,meeza,Mediocresorous!,7,1 August 2001,I `dino' know that there were releasing a third installment of Jurassic Park until early this year. So I thought two questions: 1) Why another feature on these gerontological creatures? 2) why didn't Steven Spielberg direct it? I guess I was being closed minded and was using my artificial intelligence as I asked myself those questions. The answers are clear-cut: answer to the first question would be- to make the same `millianrious' money that the first two installments made at the box office. Answer to the second question would be: because Sir Steven Spielberg was directing another film at the time -`A. I.' (Artificial Intelligence). Jurassic Park 3 bring back stars Sam Neil and Laura Dern from the first Jurassic Park. The plot is very much the same old story stuck with the same old creatures: scientists and civilians curious about these dinosaurs who then find themselves entrapped on an island later to discover that these humongous animals are not planning to get on a Jenny Craig diet in the near future. One aspect of the film that ate me up was the tremendous visual & sound effects; which is good enough for me to recommend to you to park your ass in a theatre seat and watch `Jurassic Park 3.' *** Average,Jurassic Park III
68,alindsay-al,A poor unnecessary film,2,23 May 2018,"I always had the fear with jurassic Park 3 that this concept wasn't going to be able to hold up for too much longer and unfortunately this film proves that theory correct. The premise of the film sees a couple convince Dr Alan Grant to travel to the island from The Lost World with them. As mentioned, Sam Neil is back as Dr Alan Grant and he is easily the best part of this film, he has most of his charm and charisma still intact and you care about his character. The supporting cast though is just poor, first of all is the couple he travels with the Kirbys. These characters were so bland and dull adding nothing to this film, the film tries to make you care about them but you just don't because of how poorly they are written and acted. There is a character called Ben that also goes on the trip and he is just boring, he is basically a worse version of Vince Vaughans character from the previous film. Also if you came here to see Laura Dern again she is just a glorified cameo. The story is just one big excuse to get Alan Grant on an island so they can have a jurassic Park film. You don't care about the emotional stakes in the film or the motivations of the characters. Also the film takes some directions at the start that takes away from the previous films and hurts them too. The script has a blend of cheesy humour and uninspiring drama to help in making you not care about anybody really in the film. The style of the film does have some entertaining and tense scenes in it, but they are few and far between. Also the Dinosaurs look so much worse in this film then previously which ruined some of the more tense scenes in the film. This film amazingly is only an hour and a half but feels much longer, which clearly shows that there were some issues of pacing in this film. Overall this film is one to avoid, even if you are a big fan of the is franchise it isn't one you should look for.",Jurassic Park III
69,Chris_Docker,More of the same - more expensive CGIs,4,30 July 2001,"I'm afraid this movie didn't keep me awake so I can only comment on the first two thirds of it. Basically, some humans are on an island inhabited by prehistoric monsters. To spice it up, the monsters are supposed to be super intelligent and able to talk to each other. Not clever enough to beat the humans unfortunately, who will live to make another monster movie probably. The special effects seem better than the first two efforts (JP and JPII) though the plot is so transparent it has to be enlivened with devices like a monster swallowing a mobile phone that then rings and can be heard from outside its body (duh!). The most familiar scene is some human(s) get wedged into a small space (eg car, hollow tree, whatever) and the monsters head is just slightly too big to get in and eat them, leaving them to play the scene again in a different corner. After seeing this numerous times I reckoned I'd got the idea and had a doze. Nice afternoon's big screen junk food - don't go and see it alone though - you'll need someone to talk to afterwards so you don't feel you've entirely wasted the evening.",Jurassic Park III

All meat, not potatoes or vegetables. While eating a quality piece of steak or ribs is still enjoyable, it isn't a complete meal. The quick excuse to get onto the island was a parasailing father and son get disconnected from the boat and crash onto the island. A rescue party is put together and dispatched. Upon landing on the island, dinosaurs immediately notice their new visitors. Will they find the boy and father alive and if so, can they extract them before being gobbled up? There were many genuine tense moments and some entertaining dinosaur fights so you get what you pay for. If they wrote a better script, this would have been much more satisfying.",Jurassic Park III

72,davispittman,"Not the best, but not what many claim it is",7,12 March 2017,"Jurassic Park III gets a lot of fiery hate from people. I mean a lot of people really HATE this film, but I've always enjoyed it for what it is. What it is is a Jurassic park sequel. I don't expect an Oscar winning, extremely well written movie, I expect close to two hours of good exciting fun. And that is exactly what I got from this third installment in the series. Tea Leoni is a pretty good fit for the role of the mother desperately looking for her son. And of course Sam Neill is good, he's basically the same thing here as in the original Jurassic Park. I really didn't care for William H. Macy as the role of the father of the missing teenage son, I don't know I just didn't buy his performance and I didn't like the way in which he portrayed his character. The visual effects are nicely done, especially when they pass by a field of grazing dinosaurs while on a boat and the infamous score begins to play. The movie does have its moments of characters doing things that aren't so wise given the situation they're in, like Tea Leoni yelling for her son in the megaphone, she must think that maybe that's not a good plan since there are life threatening creatures on the island. But really other than that one instance, there wasn't anything else in the film that I objected to. Sure, they could've done more with this movie, but I seriously don't understand why everyone just loves to dump on this film so much. 7/10.",Jurassic Park III
73,drystyx,Best of the Jurassic movies,9,12 December 2006,"If you've seen the first two Jurassic movies, rest assured this one is more like the first than the lame second one, but always remember in sequels, the odd numbered ones are always best and the even ones stinkers (remember Jaws?) In most respects this one was even better than the first. I won't spoil the movie by saying how many characters are centralized, but rest assured that all the characters are dealt with in some degree of dignity, unlike the others which had some real lame throwaway characters. Even the viler characters here have some dignity to them. The writers didn't just play God and say ""Its okay to justify killing certain people,"" which is what the first two movies did. There are a few twists, not too spectacular, but that makes it a little more endearing. This movie takes you through the lives of people much more than the other two did, and its very interesting that this movie strayed from the cliché of most modern movies in which all the heroes are married family men- in fact, even the father figure is a stepfather (and he's not even demonized-how did they dare do this?) A must for iconoclastic sorts, outsiders, and outcasts.",Jurassic Park III
74,slokes,Jurassic Light Not Quite Right,5,15 August 2003,"Sequels are a study in diminishing returns with few exceptions, and when it comes to tri-quels, it's an even starker situation. From ""Superman"" to ""Star Wars,"" the third time's no charm. More often, such films only manage to pad producers' wallets while diluting the memory of what came before.The first good thing about ""Jurassic Park III"" is diminishing what came before is beyond human capacity, because what came before was ""Jurassic Park II,"" the most monumental turkey ever to bear the name ""Steven Speilberg"" (and not just as producer, mind, but director as well.) At least in JP3, there's no obnoxious Greenpeace guy, no tacked-on San Diego sidebar, and a lower budget that tamps down on the plot sprawl.It's still not a good film. With only a handful of characters, there's not much suspense about who's going to get it, nor any big surprises in how that happens. A lower budget might lead to more thoughtful marshaling, but not as far as the characters are concerned. The actors playing Billy and Erik annoy tremendously, while the late Michael Jeter, playing the leader of a trio of dim mercenaries, does not stick around nearly long enough. In a film as sparsely populated as a Beckett play, such poor resource management is hard to overlook. We get plenty of CGI, but nothing we haven't seen, except a couple of new dinosaurs who roar and snap their teeth pro forma. Show me something new. Billy's fate feels like the result of a quick tack-on after a poor initial audience screening, and his out-of-the-blue paragliding exploits stretch the conventions of even this series (where 10,000-volt fences have been known to barely muss the overtended coiffures of young boys.)Though directed by Joe Johnston, this remains Steven Speilberg's baby, which means you can count on a few things. The woman will make it through alive, the hero will make witty asides while wearing a rain-soaked fedora, and the kid will show spunk and enterprise well beyond his years (seeing Erik suddenly show up in his shrubbery costume was the single biggest groan in a movie full of them. Of course the movie's for kids, but do they have to rub it in?) Amazingly, violating Speilberg's no-guns provision in which no character can accomplish anything positive with a loaded weapon not pointed at a German, one pistol does manage to come in handy. It's a flare gun, but a welcome change of pace still.I liked Sam Neill a lot, and found myself enjoying William H. Macy and Tea Leoni's portrayal of the unhappy couple despite myself. Leoni deserves a better career than she's had. I'm not sure whether the film is sending up their yuppie self-absorbtion or celebrating it (three or four dead people and a crashed plane is a hell of a bill for relationship counseling, wouldn't you say?) but I'll say the former and enjoy it for what it is. The action sequences are reportedly rejected storyboarding from the first movie, but work surprisingly well for second-hand cobblings, not thrilling so much as effective in moving the plot along quickly. JP3 is not a good film, it's not even fair, but there's intelligence and talent behind it all the same.Ultimately, the fault here is not one of a director's lack of vision, or writer's block. It's that the third time around the Park, the wonder of dinosaur-gazing seems gone, and much of the film has a tired, put-upon feeling, like ""We're here because you want us here, not because we want to be here."" They say we're due for Jurassic IV in 2005, but I for one would gladly vote them off the island if they gave me the chance.",Jurassic Park III
75,TOMNEL,Better than it's reputation.,7,31 December 2006,"I don't think people get it that when a movie comes out and it's a classic, excellent film, like Jurassic Park was, that they shouldn't make sequels because it will be really hard to top it. This movie didn't top the first film by any means, but it was much better than the Lost World. I don't know what it is about it, but it has a feel much closer to the originals, and it makes it quite enjoyable. In this Jurassic outing, Dr. Grant (Sam Neil) is back, and now is an author telling his tales from the park (his book is rivals with Ian Malcom's). He gets trapped on the island again when taking a couple (William H Macy and Tea Leoni) on an in flight tour, and the plane gets trapped in a tree. Where the first film focuses more on the T-Rex, this one focuses on the raptors and their intelligence. Watching this, it was actually a pretty good movie, all except the extremely abrupt ending. Where you expect to get another thirty minutes of Dino action, we get a tacked on and quite annoying ending, however the movie is still very good, for what it is. In the battle between protagonists being Sam Neil or Jeff Goldblum, I find Neil is much more tolerable and Goldblum is much better as a side character.My rating: *** out of ****. 85 mins. PG-13 for violence.",Jurassic Park III

Maybe its time to put the money they used to make this film and put it into another project. I also love the big inconsistency with the new `evil' dinosaur.

There are soooooo many plot-holes in this movie that if movies were houses this one would fall over due to structural damage. This movie is a streamlined version of the first ""Jurassic Park"", only with more, more, MORE! Because, as we know, more is always better in storytelling. Where the first ""Jurassic Park"" takes nigh forty-five minutes for the first large dinos to appear on screen (I know there are baby ones earlier), this film features the first dinosaur kill about twenty-three minutes in, and it's vicious; a man is gobbled up by a raging dino and his blood splashes across the windshield of a plane, streaking backwards across the glass in rivulets of red.

What's unforgivable is when a film lacks the courage to play the right plot development and opts instead to give the audience what it DOESN'T want. That's what happens here.  (At least, that's what happens unless I have an unrealistically high opinion of popular taste, which, admittedly, isn't hard.)  When the two adventurers reveal that the real reason they've kidnapped Dr. Grant and risked their damn fool necks is that they're looking for their missing son, whom they're SURE is still alive, even though any reasonable person would realise that (a) he must be dead by now, and (b) even if he isn't dead by now, the attempt to rescue him would almost certainly prove futile ... well, surely any audience with blood flowing through its veins will be longing for the parents to be proved wrong, for the rescue party to fail to find any evidence that the child is alive or to find irrefutable evidence that he is dead (either would do), and for the two selfish, idiotic violators of international law to return from the island sadder but wiser ... but, of course, we can sense that the narrative is being driven by autopilot from one cliché to the next, and that this won't happen.  And indeed it doesn't.  The boy is alive and he is rescued.  (Three men die in order to save the life of this one boy, but Amanda and Paul see no need to worry about that, because, hey, they're other people's sons.)I'm not sure that this miserably stupid film (rule of thumb: the intelligence of a Jurassic Park movie varies inversely with the depicted intelligence of its raptors) is any more ludicrous than its predecessor; its basic story is, if anything, better motivated.  But make no mistake: it's far worse.  In ""The Lost World"", Spielberg seemed to be going through the motions, shooting a script that bored him, and even so he brought the story to life in a way that Johnston could only dream of doing.  To see Jurassic II and then Jurassic III is to understand the difference between rubbish that works and rubbish that doesn't.Even the photography seems to have gone badly wrong.  This may have just been the particular print I saw - I suspect it was - but the fact remains: the colours were sludgy, the shadows were misty, the blacks not nearly black enough ... exactly as though the film had all been badly under-exposed.  Did anyone else notice this?  Did I see a dud print, or was the under-exposure deliberate, something which made it easier to insert the (not particularly impressive) digital effects?",Jurassic Park III

A welcome return also of Sam Neil and some rather nice flying reptiles.",Jurassic Park III
80,Matt_Layden,Evolve or Die.,5,14 August 2010,"Jurassic Park 3 is the one in the series that is not directed by Spielberg. It gets a lot of flack and deservedly so, the film is a poor excuse to get another film in the theatres to make money. Let's look at the reason they go back to the island. A couple trick the poor Dr. Grant into going back to the island. He thinks they are flying over it, when in reality they land on the island to look for their son who has disappeared on it. Start the dino attacks.This film is famous for two things, one is the Spinosaurus, the so called new king of the jungle. We are given a small useless fight scene between the Spinosaurus and the T-Rex to prove this point. Ram it down out throats, we get it a new dinosaur that is more dangerous. The second would be the Pterodons stuck in their bird cage. An exciting sequence yes, but something small that is stuck in a ridiculous film. Given that the point of this film is really useless, I like to look at it as a simple popcorn flick that serves no purpose other than to give the viewer a decent time at the theatre. The first two were at least based on books. The film does give decent chase sequences but we don't care for the characters other than Grant, from the first one. How the kid survived is a brain teaser. He'd be dead in reality, also how the boat they were parasailing on was destroyed and the crew killed is a plot hole to me. There are theories, but to me it's just lazy writing.Jurassic Park 3 is a short film too, they basically arrive on the island, find the kid, then leave. The sense of adventure is lessened in this one than the previous two. The stakes aren't as high and the new dinosaur is pretty much a yawn. This is the obvious weakest entry in the series which I guess makes me appreciate even the weaker Spielberg films even more.",Jurassic Park III
81,brando647,An Unnecessary Sequel,6,13 May 2008,"What happens when you remove Michael Crichton and Steven Spielberg from the Jurassic Park series? You get a mediocre ""adventure"" film like JP3. In my opinion, this movie didn't really need to be made. I feel it's existence actually taints the reputation of one of my favorite movie franchises; it's one of the most unnecessary sequels since 1989's ""The Fly II"". This movie finds Alan Grant (Sam Neill) convinced by a suspicious married couple into taking them on a guided tour over Isla Sorna but their true motivations soon lead to the group becoming stranded on the island.The movie has a good cast but it doesn't seem to do it any good. Sam Neill reprises his role as Alan Grant from the first film but his performance almost seems wasted here. William H. Macy and Tea Leoni play Paul and Amanda Kirby, the married couple who convince Grant to lead them. Seriously, why is Macy wasting his time in this movie? I've got more respect for him; I like him as an actor and he deserves better than a lame/pointless sequel. Leoni REALLY got on my nerves. From the start, I was hoping to see her become dinner for the raptors if it meant I wouldn't have to listen to her screeching any longer. Michael Jeter, another actor I enjoy, is wasted in a minor role as the organizer of the expedition. With so many good actors in this film, I should've enjoyed it a bit more...As usual with the JP series, the dinosaurs look fantastic for the most part. I did find it kind of odd that somewhere between the first two movies and this one, the dinosaurs all seemed to evolve with colorful party patterns on their skin. The movie continues to introduce more and more dinosaurs, which I don't understand. How can different dinosaurs appear on the island with each visit? Is it really possible that the gatherer team from the first trip to Isla Sorna wouldn't have seen an ankylosaur? Or the spinosaurus? I refuse to believe that Malcolm's team could've wandered through the island as much as they did and NOT found this raging dinosaur...especially since he appears to be EVERYWHERE. Although, I did enjoy the addition of the pteranodons to the mix.The movie never really explains the spinosaur's sudden appearance other than an offhand comment from Grant claiming that it was one of InGen's secrets. I hate the idea of the spinosaur, if only because I feel it was brought in because director Joe Johnston wanted to make his JP film bigger than the previous. So, to outdo the previous two films and make his movie more extreme, he mysteriously brings in this spinosaurus and even throws in a battle between the spinosaurus and a tyrannosaurus so he can show the audience, ""See! My dinosaurs BIGGER and SCARIER than your T-Rex!"". I was let down with the concept from the spinosaur's first appearance.JP3 isn't a BAD film, it's just menial. There is nothing special about it. The cast, while it has it's share of good actors, feels wasted on a lame story. There were more than a couple instances when I felt the story was weakened: the unexplained incident in the opening, the escape from the island, and the fate of Grant's assistant, Billy Brennan (Alessandro Nivola). It's a story with enough plot holes and frustration that I felt it single-handedly killed a franchise.",Jurassic Park III
82,Terryfan,Return to the island,7,11 June 2015,"History is crazy when you look back on things, in 2001 I remember being so pumped for another film in the Jurassic Park series I saw this one in theaters with my brother. The film had me on the edge of my seat during the scenes with the DinosaursBut looking back on it the film did hurt the series that we know and love. For one thing it is directed by Joe Johnson. He just didn't seem to fit the role of director. That's like replacing your best Quarterback for a second string QB just won't work. Plus the film took out the beloved Tyrannosaurus Rex with in seconds just to bring in a new dinosaur Spinosaurus? I mean all Jurassic Park fans know that The T-Rex is the flagship Dinosaur along with the Raptors and you can't have a film like this without the other.There is just so many wrongs it's hard to pick up the rights in this film but I will share my thoughts on the good.The plot of the film is center around Dr. Alan Grant (Sam Neill) along with his partner on the dig site he was working on Billy Brennan (Alessandro Nivola) were ask to their guide as they fly over Isla Sorna Site B with Paul Kirby (William H Macy) and his wife Amanda Kirby (Téa Leoni) however things are not what they appear to be as they also accomplish by three mercenaries Mr.Udesky (Michael Jeter) Cooper (John Diehl) and M.B.Nash (Bruce A.Young). The Kirbys have a real hidden agenda their real intentions was to have Dr.Grant help them find their son Eric (Trevor Morgan) who was lost on the island due to a accident. However two of the mercenaries are killed by the Spinosaurus as their only way of escaping their plane crashed as then destroyed by the Spinosaurus.To make matters worse they are also chase by Velociraptors. So pretty much most of the film is spend with the characters being chased and running away from the Dinosaurs like a game of cat and mouseWhat's another knock on the film is that the relationship between Dr.Grant and Dr.Ellie Sattler (Laura Dern) is no longer the same as it was in the first film that really show case one of the red flags for the film, I mean I would have love to see Ellie and Alan still together but no they just ruin that relationship for us.Another bone I have to pick about this film is that the effects for the Dinosaurs are just a let down the first two were far superior while there are a few effects for the Dinosaurs like the Pteranodon scene that has good effects. Also the film is only 90 minutes long making it the shortest film of the Jurassic Park movies which is another knock on the film.The good I like is that Sam's performance shows how he was meant to play Dr.Alan Grant only he could be that character no one else. Laura returning as Ellie was better than nothing. Also there are some tense movements in the film like I love the scene the Raptor was pretending to be inside the glass tube when he really was behind it I love how well that was build so that is one plus I can give for the film.Also the setting of the island looks more swamp. The music once again matches the story of the film as you can always count on Jurassic Park to make some of the best music in a motion pictureThe plot was interesting despite some knocks, Just wish Alan and Ellie were still together that is one thing that could have made the film better. Overall I will consider Jurassic Park 3 a mix bag I'm giving the rating I give because I love Jurassic Park it just this film could have been better if it wasn't being rush I give Jurassic Park 3 an 7 out of 10",Jurassic Park III

Macy) on a guided tour of the island, or so he thinks? The action is plentiful, and we see some new dinosaurs in this one, but unless great special effects, lots of chasing and running and plenty of action is all you're after, you may feel a little let down by the idiocy of the plot and the characters in it.

It's hard to decide where to even start with this extinction level disaster.Sam Neil, as JP1 veteran Dr. Grant, tries, but has no script to work with. William H. Macy, usually able to make the most out of any role, has a character that appears to have been written by a 5 year old. Tea Leoni is, well, Tea Leoni.Laura Dern, as Elly, is involved, but relegated to (literally) a phone-in role. No, I'm not making that up. Some bozo actually thought having Elly and Grant discuss things over cell phones would be more exciting than having Elly present on the island for the action. Well, this brilliant maneuver did set up a scintillating scene where a phone falls in the water. Wow, talk about suspense. Other vets from the first two films wisely said thanks, but no thanks to signing on.Spielberg is now gone, and it shows. The script for this junk would have been laughed at by him, probably. A couple of people hire Grant to assist them, as they fly into a dino-infested island (yeah, another one, folks). Bodies start piling up immediately, as smart raptors wander around croaking bad guys. Ugh. It reminded me of the later Godzilla comedies, when the big serpent started knowing which human were good, and which were bad. The raptors follow suit. No, really.Blood, guts, people running around, some getting killed in a forest. It all looks like one of those Sci-Fi channel low budget quickies. But forget about a coherent story. In one scene, Grant et al inspect a giant bird cage with giant bird droppings.

JURASSIC PARK III takes those decades of learning - and gives us Running and Screaming a lot.Totally lost the plot; the corporations and marketers and unevolved apes who call themselves filmmakers have forgotten what made dinosaurs such a wonder in the first place. It wasn't ""Running and Screaming From Them."" The majesty, the mystery, the alienness of dinosaurs to current fauna; the thought-provoking concept that all the dinosaurs we know of are actually more successful as a species than Man, having thrived for millions of years (while homo sapiens has been in recognizable form only 100,000 - some say even less after viewing Rob Schneider movies); the fact that at their reign, certain dinosaur species were the largest animals on Earth; the foods they ate, their herd habits; the fact they were NOT REPTILES but a sub-Group of Archosaurs; the fact they are more closely related to birds than reptiles or mammals - all these things make dinosaurs intriguing and wondrous.But JURASSIC PARK III has Running and Screaming.Sam Neill is once again Dr. Alan Grant (remember him? From JURASSIC PARK, 1993, sensibly sidestepping THE LOST WORLD, then insensibly stepping in it with this one) is tricked onto that OTHER island with the dinosaurs - Isla Sorna? Isla Nublar? - who cares? When does the Running and Screaming Express leave? Only two subplots are worth mentioning in this film - that of the velociraptors' communicative abilities (through noises made via an air chamber in their skulls); and the heartbreaking fallout between Grant and his student sidekick (young, muscular, blonde Allesandro Nivola, one-upping Jeff Goldblum as The Sexyboy).All the rest is Running and Screaming.William H. Macy is the same old worry-wart poindexter, surprisingly matched with a smoking' ex-wife, Tea Leoni - both looking for their son (Trevor Morgan) on the island. Don't even ask how the plot got him there - suffice to say, it was ridiculous wrapped in stupid and blow-dried by idiotic. Michael Jeter is the faux mercenary, quickly becoming the William H. Macy of B-Actors. Laura Dern makes an interesting cameo as Ellie Satler, Grant's gf from JURASSIC PARK. She is married to someone else. Bitch.Sam Neill has a great authoritative role, and his delivery is always fun: ""We haven't landed yet!"" ""Mr. Kirby, tell her to stop doing that."" ""If I lose you, it's just me and the tourists."" The feature saurian (meaning the One That Does The Most Chasing of the Running and Screaming People) is a Spinosaurus, bigger than a t-rex, with a sail like Dimetrodon (even more believable than those glued-on sails on 1950s iguanas) and with hands that actually work. Early on, we are treated to the Ali-Frasier of Dinosaur ringside - the Spino versus the Tyranno. There can be only one. Because the effects department complained.For effects adrenalin, for believability of the dinosaurs, this movie is unbeatable. That's why it still scores in high mediocre. I don't mind seeing all the dinosaurs - it's what the movie turns them into that vexes me. I'm terribly vexed. They are simply Things To Run From. The few seconds of wonder come in barely noticeable snatches (where John Williams's majestic theme would try and manipulate us into sharing the moment).When I was a kid watching all those stop-motion movies (JASON AND THE ARGONAUTS, BEAST FROM 20,000 FATHOMS, VALLEY OF GWANGI) and those stinkers with iguanas with glued-on sails (KING DINOSAUR, THE LOST WORLD 1960), I was always aching to snatch a glimpse of something prehistoric - invariably there would never be enough ""prehistoric"" stuff (and the cave women never slipped nipple out of their furs). And when we did see the feature creatures, it was disappointing at best, as they were on a rear projection or interacting very suspiciously unrealistically with the actors.So I'm envious of ""kids today"" who get served up movies like JP III; kids who are here for the same reason I was there back then - for the Running and Screaming! And see lots of prehistoric creatures in grand interaction with people.But back to the subplots: When Grant finds out that the entirely-likable Billy has stolen some raptor eggs (for the best research intentions and funding), he belittles him so thoroughly that we feel Billy's humiliation like a hot flush. And we understand why Billy would later sacrifice himself. We wish we could see Grant retract his scathing derogation, but we don't.The science of dinosaur communication, appearance and habits has grown exponentially concurrently with the JURASSIC PARK films. Subsequently, the velociraptors in the films have ""evolved"" from from being dull brown to sporting rudimentary feathers and various colors; in JURASSIC PARK they simply roared, now in JP III, they're honking and yipping all over the place like chicks at a slumber party - ""intelligence greater than primates. "" I say, old chap, that's all dashed interesting - but - shouldn't the original DNA have brought out those characteristics in the very first cloned dinosaurs (in JURASSIC PARK)? Just because WE'VE discovered it only now doesn't mean that they weren't always like that - their DNA should have reflected that! Yes, fans, I have indisputably proved that JURASSIC PARK is Only A Movie! I forgot to mention the Running and Screaming.Last scene shows pteranodons flying out over the ocean, the kid asking, ""Where do you think they're going?"" To JURASSIC PARK IV, of course.",Jurassic Park III
87,pyrocitor,Another walk in the park,6,5 January 2006,"Jurassic Park 3 The hardest part about continuing a franchise over an extended period of time is maintaining that every instalment seem familiar enough that it can still capitalise on the success of earlier films in the franchise, and yet still seem fresh and different enough for audiences to maintain interest. One way to change the focus a bit would be to hire a new director for a new creative outlook on the project, as was done by Spielberg-appointed Joe Johnston. The poor man must have had an enormous amount of pressure on him to not destroy the world Spielberg had so masterfully created in the first two films in the series. Johnston indeed doesn't tank the series here, but he is certainly no Steven Spielberg, and so the overall quality of the film falls, as would be expected. Johnston seems adept at picking up where Spielberg left off, and it is clear that effort is being shown to continually push the envelope in terms of special effects and constant thrills and tension. Indeed, not a minute has passed since the humans landing on it before they are already attacked and people start to die. This is one of the main flaws in Jurassic Park 3 - it continues the ""non-stop thrills"" theme the first two demonstrated, but seems a bit more blatant in doing so. The incessant action, while enjoyable seems a bit too unrealistic and staged to be entirely enjoyable. Even the huge action setpiece of T-Rex versus new enormous predatorial dinosaur Spinosaurus, which exhilarating and highly enjoyable seems ridiculously gratuitous, which subtracts from the fun somewhat. And I find it hard to understand how with such excellent dinosaur special effects, a destroyed plane after a crash can look so much like cardboard...All in all, it seems like all the best moments in Jurassic Park 3 are ones that we've already seen countless times before. It's still all fun, but not executed nearly as well as in the Spielberg films, so one feels as if one might as well be watching one of the earlier movies. The sequence in the tyrannodon ""bird-cage"" is the exception - thrilling, breathless, tense and wonderfully executed, it is easily the high point of the movie. However, there are still decent performances present in Jurassic Park 3: Sam Niel gives the film his all, reprising his gruff palaeontologist character Alan Grant from the first film, he is easily the highlight of this one. William H. Macy and Téa Léoni are believable as parents, frantic to find their lost son, and have excellent chemistry with each other, though both come off as annoying quite often during the movie, and it is of course nice to see a tiny appearance from Laura Dern, also reprising her character from the first Jurassic Park movie. She and Sam Niel still show superb chemistry, and it's a shame her part wasn't larger in this movie. So all in all, Jurassic Park 3 is an entertaining enough movie, but still falls short of echoing the quality of the first two films. All the best moments are ones we've already seen many times before in the earlier two movies, in which they were executed better. Still, JP3 seems a valiant attempt by all concerned, if fraught with too many cheesy moments and unbelievable situations to be entirely credible. Still an entertaining way to pas the time, but when in doubt, see either of the first two - they are much stronger and more entertaining films, and in the end, JP3 just seems like a weaker relapse of them.-6.5/10",Jurassic Park III
88,PatrynXX,"Not as good as the first two, but JP3 is easier to watch.",6,29 December 2001,"Spoilers???
I'm split.  For years I've been giving (since about 1995 was my first visit to imdb) stars on imdb.  For over 2 years I've been writing reviews on imdb. I've come to the opinion that I can still give a lower star rating and still love the movie.  My star ratings are mostly given on what stars I think it deserves.  Not how much I like the movie.  So hence I give it a 6/10.I found that this is definately not like the first two.  The first two made you utterly scared to replay the movie.  Simply because you felt that the lead characters were going to die.  But because of that edge, in the end you always came back.  Ten years from now, I'll probably still watch JP1.  But not JP2 or maybe JP3.  It's kinda like watching Braveheart verses Dr. Dolittle.  I loved the Dr., but I rarely play it anymore.  It got tons of play that I got tired of it.  But Braveheart I haven't watched alot.JP3 is too easy to watch.  There is no edge to it.  The scariest part perhaps is in the aviary and that's it.   The rumbles don't scare us anymore.  The frightful sounds that we should be scared of are often so faint that who the hell cares.  I had to turn up my volume to 50 just to figure out that the dad had heard his kid cry for him.I'd compare this like Firestarter verses Salems Lot.  Which is easier to watch?All I'm saying is JP3 will not make you pee in your pants.  If you want that, you'll leave disappointed.(DVD comments:  dvd isn't bad, but it's features are more complicated than they need to be.  )6/10Quality: 4/10 Entertainment: 8/10 Replayable: 9/10",Jurassic Park III
89,TheUnknown837-1,"""Listen...you hear that?"" The Jurassic Park series has finally started to run out of steam",6,22 November 2009,"If you can sum up the story of the third installment of the Jurassic Park series, it would be using two quotes that are heard continually throughout the course of the movie. ""Listenyou hear that?"" and then ""Run!"" And that will tell you the whole story. ""Jurassic Park III"" is nothing more than a creature feature. It's a high-tech creature feature like its predecessor ""The Lost World: Jurassic Park"", but unlike that film, which was energetic and fun and most certainly unlike the first movie, which was full of spectacle, ""Jurassic Park III"" is a bland creature feature. It's not a total disaster and it's not hard to sit through, but unlike the first two movies, it just does not have the zest and energy and this could be attributed to the departure of Steven Spielberg as the director.In the movie, Dr. Alan Grant (Sam Neill) is asked by a pair of wealthy entrepreneurs (William H. Macy and Téa Leoni) to be their aerial guide as they fly over Isla Sorna, the island where genetically-engineered dinosaurs run amok. After being offered a huge paycheck, Grant agrees, and sure enough, as you'd expect, the plane crashes and the survivors are immediately running from peril from the prehistoric monsters roaming the jungles.And all that follows this is nothing but setup, and then running from the dinosaurs. Now this formula was used extensively throughout the running time of ""The Lost World: Jurassic Park"", but it was done with such efficient timing and energy that it was riveting entertainment. And the first ""Jurassic Park"" had a lot of dinosaur attacks, but what made it so special and profound was the sense of awe and majesty and wonder that Spielberg instilled into his mechanical and computer-generated creatures. The first movie had our jaws hung in awe and admiration, the second had us on a roller coast thrill ride. ""Jurassic Park III"" tries to mix a little of both of these, more the latter than the former, but in the end, it's too cliché, a little tiresome, and impoverished of imagination.Nobody really expects interesting characters in a Jurassic Park film, although it would be nice to see some. So the cast is really two-dimensional in terms of personality. But we don't go to the theater to see them. We go to see the dinosaurs.So what about the big lizards of ""Jurassic Park III""? Well, again, they're the best thing in the movie, but even they are a little watered down. Visually, they are moderately impressive. The combination of life-sized animatronics and computer-generated imagery is well-done to generate the illusion. But what these dinosaurs lack is a sense of profound presence. We don't really feel any menace or majesty about them. Even when a dinosaur is tearing a person to shreds, there isn't much impact on the audience because the dinosaurs are losing interest as well. The new dinosaur antagonist, a spinosaurus, is convincing in appearance but very dull in terms of the way it's presented whereas say the tyrannosaurus and the velociraptors of the first two movies had a lot of screen presence. The t-rex has a cameo in this movie and the raptors are over-exaggerated to the point where they become unwieldy instead of realistically scary. And the other dinosaurs? The herbivores. Completely boring. Remember the magical moment in the brachiosaur scene of the first movie? It was spine-tingling and beautiful. There is none of that in the third movie. The only dinosaurs that are given any consideration are the meat-eating predators. Because the movie is more or less relying on them to save the day, expecting the audience to believe dinosaurs to be only scary monsters.Perhaps I'm being a little too rough on ""Jurassic Park III"". There were a few moments including a fun scene where the characters contend with a pack of pterodactyls in a giant birdcage that I really enjoyed and the movie did not overstay its welcome due to a very rapid running time. In the end, I didn't hate the movie, I just didn't think it was on the same level as its two predecessors and wasn't all that enjoyable of a movie. I hope that Universal continues to scrap plans for a fourth movie, because the Excessive Sequel Syndrome is coming into effect and the Jurassic Park series is starting to run out of steam.",Jurassic Park III
90,DunnDeeDaGreat,A good follow up to a dismal sequel,7,23 July 2001,I find Jurrasic Park 3 to be a good sequel to a great film. I think this should have been the sequel to the first film. Sure the diagoule was kind of written the way people talk but who cares just go in and have a good time. Can't wait for Jurraisc Park 4.,Jurassic Park III
91,blott2319-1,Don't understand the hate...,7,12 June 2020,"I never understood the hatred for Jurassic Park III, and I was glad to see when I returned to it this week, it was as enjoyable as I remembered. Considering the mess that was The Lost World, they needed to get the train back on the rails, and I think this movie accomplished that. Of course, none of the sequels are great, but that's because Jurassic Park isn't a movie that needed to be a franchise, so any sequelization is a stretch. However, if what you want from one of these films is some good dinosaur-vs-human action, then I think this movie delivers. Jurassic Park III gives good motivation for why these people are going to the island, and gets Sam Neill back into the franchise in a way that makes sense. I like that he never fully changed his ways and remains a bit of an odd individual whose devotion to his work has made it difficult to connect with people. The other characters are OK (in particular, William H. Macy who tried to do something interesting with what he was given,) but most of them are just there to scream, run for their lives, and maybe get eaten.I'm desperately waiting for the first Jurassic Park movie that doesn't feel the need to shove kids into it, because they are always the worst aspect of these films. This was the closest we come, because about half the film has no sign of a child. Sure enough, the movie does get a bit more ridiculous and stupid once the boy arrives, but he doesn't do as much to make it annoying as others have in this series (at least he does no gymnastics.) The weakest aspect of Jurassic Park III is probably the CGI and practical effects. They don't look quite right, and lack the authentic appearance that Spielberg pulled off in the first film. It seems that Joe Johnston also wanted to play around with color a bit more in this film, so there's a lot of variable skin colors on the dinosaurs this time, and it can make them look artificial and cartoon-like. I can also admit that there's not a lot of great plot in this movie. Once the action gets started, there's not much more to it than running. Even so, I enjoy Jurassic Park III for what it is, and I think it holds up well.",Jurassic Park III
92,gizmomogwai,Actually a worthy chapter in the trilogy,7,8 February 2008,"Jurassic Park III, when it came out, split the critics. Ebert thought this was the best that the genre could do and other critics hated it. Others said it didn't matter whether or not it was good because the first two were enough. Personally, I think it's a worthy addition to the trilogy. Jurassic Park III is simple- a simple plot, only 80 or 90 minutes long, but less is more. The dinosaurs aren't just more of the same. The rex is replaced by the Spinosaur, who's supposedly bigger but definitely leaner and meaner. The pterosaurs are seen battling humans for the first time- taking the man vs. nature struggle to the air. The struggle is also fought in the water for the first time as the Spinosaur can swim. On land, we have the raptors, but they're revised, and they're smarter than they were in The Lost World, which makes them more interesting.Sam Neill, who starred in the first one, stars in this one as well after being left out of The Lost World. (Perhaps in fairness, Jeff Goldblum starred in the second and was left out in the third). Neill is good here. One flaw of this movie, though, is the special effects. These are the least convincing in the trilogy, particularly on the small screen. Still, Jurassic Park III is good for a sequel of its kind. Recommended for fans of action movies.",Jurassic Park III

94,mattymatt4ever,Why even bother?,3,18 July 2001,"This is another one of those ""why bother?"" sequels.  Just like ""Jaws 3"" and all those other tired sequels.  I guess publicists felt they can make money on a film that simply has ""Jurassic Park"" in the title.  After all, the last two were hits.  I deeply enjoyed the original and personally, I didn't like the sequel as much, yet I enjoyed it to a degree and didn't hate it as much as lots of audiences did.  But this third outing is total crap!At the same time, I can't say I was disappointed.  That's one positive note. How many good Number Threes do you ever see in the movies?  I liked ""Rocky 3,"" I liked ""Die Hard 3,"" but more often that not we're faced with those ""Enough already!"" sequels like ""Back to the Future 3"" (I LOVED the original and can watch it over and over again).  It's bad enough that the initial sequels usually suck, but once they go for another try--they often fall flat on their faces.  And Positive Note # 2?:  It was short!  Sure, when you watch a good movie, you don't want it to end, but after sitting through the slow, 3-hour torture of ""Pearl Harbor"" I'm just grateful I got it over with in approximately 90 minutes.I felt the addition of William H. Macy (an actor I deeply admire) to the cast would at least make this sequel halfway decent.  Well, I was wrong. Macy tried his best, but his character is so embarrassing and one-dimensional.  Tea Leoni plays his ex-wife, and her job is pretty much to...annoy the hell out of the audience with high-pitch screams.  In every scary movie there's always that one female character who gets terrified and screams at everything that crosses her path--whether it's a false alarm or not.  Well, that sums up Leoni's character, and she hams it up to the fullest.  Sam Neill (about the only character reprised from the original) is the only one we really give a damn about.  And even the prestigious Australian actor seems subdued and bored in his performance.  Yet he's about the one who gives this lifeless actioner a little bit of fuel.
The action and terror scenes are totally cliched.  You'd have to be either under ten years old or the most timid being on Earth to receive a jolt from these cheap thrills.  The plot is very thin, and there is nothing you wouldn't expect.  Dinosaurs approach, people run away.  Minor characters get eaten.  The black man has to die first.  I guess without Spielberg in the director's chair we can feel free to inject all the cliches we want.  The lighting is dull and uninteresting.  There aren't any good scenic shots, like Spielberg gave us in the original.  The direction is completely formulaic.  About the only shot I admire is one where Leoni is hanging on a tree by her feet and a dinosaur jumps up and tries to snap at her.  That was, I think, the only attempt at true suspense.The characters (except for Neill) are so flat and unoriginal (and somewhat annoying) that you're cheering for the dinosaurs!!!  You want those monsters to devour these morons so this movie can finally be over and done with!!!If you're expecting another lame sequel--you guessed right!  Please save your money!  This is a walk in the park you shouldn't take.

95,vip_ebriega,"Worthy sequel, if quite unnecessary.",8,16 March 2007,"My Take: Serves little purpose as a sequel but packed with enough thrills to give you a bang for your buck. I am a great ""Dino-sized"" fan of the first to ""Jurassic Park"" films by Steven Spielberg. The first one was a classic masterpiece, one of the greatest films ever made. The second one was underrated. It was still a masterpiece for me. Both of them are so successful in the box-office, so plans for another sequel, not based on Crichton's novel, are well-prepared. Eventually, JP3 (the abbreviation for ""Jurassic Park III""), although not a tanker at the box-office, wasn't as successful as the first two, but nevertheless, it's still fine entertainment. The film brings back Sam Niell for another round as Dr. Alan Grant to escort a adventurous billionaire couple on an aerial tour at Isla Sorna, the Dinosaurs' breeding ground. What happens? Their plane crashes and they come face to face with another group of deadly Dinos.For something of a monster movie, it was kinda good. But it is highly unnecessary. It's just like a chance to put a group of unlucky individuals in a frightening situation, as in death. Throw back some of the original films' characters, and voilà! It's an official sequel.Nevertheless, as it is, JP3 so rightfully deserves a place in this JURASSIC PARK fan's heart. The fact that it delivers everything it promises is exactly what anyone who went out to see JURASSIC PARK III could possibly want. It's just another walk in the park, but that feels fine.

96,jhclues,They're Back...,8,28 July 2001,"The dinosaurs are back and they're bigger and better than ever, in this third installment that expands the series that began in 1993, and it still awe-inspiring in it's grandeur and size.  `Jurassic Park III,' directed by Joe Johnston, reunites Dr. Alan Grant (Sam Neill) with his old friends the raptors, when some contrived circumstances land him back on the island (actually, the second island this time around) and he has a chance-- however unwelcomed-- to discover even more about these magnificent beasts, including the intelligence level of the raptors that he always suspected but could never prove.  And before it's over, he'll know a lot more, but at a price he'd rather exchange for ignorance than pay if he had it to do over again.	As far as Grant is concerned, Jurassic Park is history and something he'd just as soon forget.  And he definitely had no intention of ever going near one of those islands again, but just as the funding for his archeologic dig is about to dry up, a man named Paul Kirby (William H. Macy) shows up with deep pockets and a willing checkbook.  It seems that Kirby and his wife, Amanda (Tea Leoni) are adventure seekers, and for their wedding anniversary they've received permission from the Costa Rican government for a low fly-by over Isla Sorna, where the products of InGen are still thriving and roaming about freely.  They want Grant along as a kind of tour guide, and though his instincts tell him not to do it, he reluctantly agrees for the sake of his dig.  And after all, it's just a simple fly-by and they won't really be getting close to the island at all.  But we all know better than that, don't we?  Soon Grant and the Kirbys, along with their pilot and two other gentlemen, are winging their way toward the land that Grant wishes Time would've forgot.	The plot is fairly simple and straightforward, the cast is great, the special effects are outstanding, and Johnston keeps it all on track and moving right along.  Most importantly, it's fun and exciting, with just enough tension to keep you going until the end.  It's a far cry from the original `Jurassic Park,' but that is to be expected; there's no way to recapture that special sense of wonder evoked by that very first glimpse of the island and those dinosaurs, and that's what really separates the original from the sequels.  You can only discover something once, and after that it becomes a matter of simply pursuing more of the same.  But it's kind of like discovering chocolate cake; that first time is great, even something special, but it doesn't mean you don't enjoy it just as much the next time around, especially if it's good cake.	Malcom is sorely missed in this one, but it's good to see Dr. Grant back, and Sam Neill slips comfortably back into the role as if he never left, picking right up where he left off without missing a beat.  And Macy can always be counted upon to deliver a solid performance, no matter what role he's playing; he's simply one of the best character actors in the business, and he does an excellent job of bringing Kirby to life here.  Tea Leoni is also a welcome addition to the `JP' family, and though this part is hardly a stretch for her as an actor, she makes her character believable, and she and Macy work very well together.	The supporting cast includes Michael Jeter (Udesky), Alessandro Nivola (Billy), Trevor Morgan (Eric), John Diehl (Cooper), Bruce A. Young (Nash) and Laura Dern (Dr. Ellie Sattler).  This isn't a film that purports to be insightful or anything more than what it is, which is good, solid entertainment.  But like space shuttles and Moon walks, `Jurassic Park III' is a big movie that is bound to be taken for granted to a certain extent, which is kind of a shame.  Because from Steven Spielberg, who started it all, right on down through all the rest of the cast, crew, technicians (or perhaps we should call them `magicians') and all of the rest who contributed to the monumental task of bringing this film to the screen, they did a flawless job and made it look easy.  This may be pure entertainment, but it's also art in it's purest form, and the filmmakers responsible should be acknowledged for their achievement.  Contrary to what many may think, those dinosaurs didn't put themselves up there on the screen.  And a film like this is nothing less than a tribute to talent, dedication and craftsmanship-- and without a doubt, it's what the magic of the movies is really all about.  I rate this one 8/10.",Jurassic Park III
97,SanteeFats,Very good,9,7 July 2013,"This is another very good movie in the series. Sam Neill is back as Doctor Grant.

He not only made it to the island but he has managed to survive from all the predators, big and small. Laura Dern has basically a cameo when there is a call to her home where she is not only married but has a young child. Doctor Grant manages to get a call through to her house.

98,Stampsfightclub,Adrenaline rush that redeems series,8,7 February 2010,"A worried mother and father recruit dinosaur expert Dr. Alan Grant (Neill) into helping finding their missing son who disappeared in Isla Sorna, a dinosaur inhabited island.The renowned success of Steven Spielberg's first Jurassic Park lives on today through its literal dynamic of action adventure and taking an ancient collection of creatures and encoding it into a modern society, which was brilliant. Sadly the Lost World diminished the respect of the first through conventional action sequences and atrocious array of protagonists and when this third number was scheduled for release in 2001 the word cash cow may have been uttered, and whilst this is true, there is redemption.The opening sequence sees a man and a young lad paragliding near to Isla Sorna and after a bizarre fog shot they must let go of their rope and are soon flying into the island. From there the plot brings back a few familiar faces in Sam Neill's excellent Alan Grant and some new protagonists which are quite flimsy. William H Macy is the unlikely hero, Alessandro Nivola is the aspiring learner whilst Tea Leoni is cringe worthy as an exasperated mother.Thankfully the different personalities match up in a blissfully tantalizing plot that introduces us to a Spinosaurus, pterodactyls and less compys. The problem with the second film was in fact the dinosaurs, too much action and trying to capitalise on the established usage of the first. Jurassic Park was brilliant because of their minimal screen time, less was most certainly more and that principal is close to being matched here.Perhaps the Spinosaurus is used too frequently but bar that the extensive plotting of the other action montages are great. The raptor trap was brilliantly staged and I challenge anyone to admit they weren't a little scared when we saw the raptor in the centre.Jumanji director Joe Johnston manages to effectively generate adrenaline through such well used shots during the dinosaur attacks but the tension is further mounted through the anticipation. He is very aware of the characters on the island and makes them isolated and with such dark lighting and negative protagonists this generates a fast moving plot that justifies its specified genre.The score has improved since the last film as has the dialogue and scripting in general. There is no terrible humour more sweet jibes at others whilst the romantic intention between Macy and Leoni is initially corny this fades into desperation to find their lost son.This is a fully packed adrenaline rush that is easy to watch and redeems the failure of the previous release and is a fine way to round off the series. Talks of a fourth release are still just talks and since author Michael Crichton passed away in late 2008 it is arguably best to leave the work on a high which captured his marvellous concept and generated some great big blockbusters that can be watched over and over again.",Jurassic Park III
99,CharltonBoy,Did they run out of video tape?,5,16 February 2002,I must admit the Jurassic Park films are not really my cup of tea which which will become obvious to anyone reading this review but what were they thinking about when they made this drivel? Obviously not a lot! They special affect are average in fact they are worse than the original film and the story is nothing short of pathetic. The question that first springs to mind is did Sam Neil and William H Macey actually read the script? I cant blame them for doing the film because it is extremly short and hardly involves any acting to speak of.Why not take the money and run? One thing is for sure if there is going to be a Jurassic park 4 I will be the one running a mile. Dont bother. 5 out of 10.,Jurassic Park III
100,Hollywood_Yoda,Terrible Direction,8,27 September 2018,"Spielberg should have come back for the third installment, enough said! Joe Johnston just can't hold a light to the direction that the original Jurassic Park and Lost World received. Jurassic Park III veered very sharply from the first two.However, the acting from Neill wasn't bad, as he was back as Alan Grant. And William H. May as Paul Kirby was good. Michael Jeter sadly would die, and this was one of his final films. The new dinosaurs were very life-like, more so than the first two films. The special effects department for this installment definitely didn't cut too many corners. The story was interesting, but too fast paced in places and slow in others. Partly due to the direction by Johnston.",Jurassic Park III
101,stamper,Jurassic Park III should have been The Lost World,7,13 August 2001,"SPOILERS ALERT I was really devastated after walking out of the theatre that this film was so good'. I mean I knew JP III could not be much worse than The Lost World (what the heck did Crichton think when he wrote that book??? Probably: If the first part was such a success and I would get that kind of money for a sequel I should come up with some more dino  crap!'). And that was what he did. But the screen writers here actually came up with a pretty good concept.
OK not all was good in this film. Michael Jeter (Udesky) was terribly cheesy (SPIOLERS AHEAD!!!) and I was terribly glad that my feeling he would die soon came true quickly. (SPOILERS END!!!) The rest of the cast was pretty OK with the exception of Laura Dern (Ellie) and Sam Neill (Dr. ALAN GRANT). Bringin those two back was a much better move than bringing Goldblum back, cause let's be honest Dern and Neill outplay Goldblum with their eyes closed and their hands behind their back. Those two are just great.
In addition to that there were a few surprises in this movie (at least for me). (SPOILERS AHEAD!!!) Like in the beginning with Ellie and Alan, when I thought they were married but they were not. Or when I thought the chord to which the the paraglide was connected would break, (the zooming in on the chord gave me that impression), but it did not! (SPOILERS END).
Another good thing about this movie were the effects. OK they were not as groundbreaking as in the original but they were good. The new dinosaurs all looked good. The fighting scenes were good (although not very bloody (TOO BAD)). I really like the Pteranodons (big dinosaur birds) they had in this film they were great. Just as the direction by Joe Johnston. I mean he created a good film with some really cool shots and even 2 scenes that reminded me of the original Jurassic Park. The ending scene and the scene with the boat and the herd of dinosaurs in the end. Those were really scenes that made this film surpass the stupid rip  off Lost World (I leave the Jurassic Park part out on purpose). Better actors in leading or supporting roles and more epic scenes. Though as complimenting as I might be now, there were bad things too. Like in the ending, the way everyone was rescued'. Way too fictional and overblown. But the ending shots made up for that.
After the huge success of Jurassic Park (over 900 Million dollars worldwide), The Lost World (over 600 Million dollars worldwide) and this one (which will probably pull about 410 Million Dollars Worldwide) there is no doubt there will be a fourth installment. I do not need it, but I will watch it (probably) if I like the Trailer, but only under one condition. Bring back Sam Neill and Laura Dern and please let them share more time together on  screen. THANKS (for NOTHING???)!!!! I HOPE NOT!

102,ivo-cobra8,Underrated pure fun popcorn Action film!,9,7 May 2016,"Jurassic Park III (2001) is a pure, fun, popcorn, Action Film and the third entry of the Jurassic Park trilogy. It is an awesome underrated Action flick a million ways better than the new movie Jurassic World (2015)!!!!!!!! The third entry of Jurassic park Trilogy is very underrated solid action flick. I will take third Jurassic Park III movie over Jurassic World! Just like a pure, fun, popcorn, Action Film, I will take this one. They brought Sam Neill back as Dr. Alan Grant back. The film was a rescue mission, it was fast paced and it was short than the second flick. I still love The Lost World: Jurassic Park equal as the first flick Jurassic Park, but this flick grow on me and I love it and I have changed my mind. I love this flick I love it to death. I will rather watch this flick than forgettable Jurassic World! I love this flick to death and it is my third favorite film in the Jurassic park trilogy. As the first time I saw this film, I wasn't fan about it, but I keep watching it and I liked it, this movie grow on me. The film was fast paced, it went really fast around, it was an action film, it wasn't an epic adventure like was the first movie Jurassic Park (1993) it was actually an action flick an a rescue mission. Plot: Adventure runs wild when renowned palentologist Dr. Alan Grant agrees to accompany a wealthy adventurer and his wife on an aerial tour of Isla Sorna, InGen's former breeding ground for prehistoric creatures. But when they're terrifyingly stranded, Dr. Grant discovers that his hosts are not what they seem, and the island's native inhabitants are smarter, faster, fiercer and more brutal than he ever imagined in this heart-stomping thriller.The film was directed by Joe Johnston who also directed The Rocketeer, I haven't seen that flick in ages yet, The Pagemaster, Jumanji and Captain America: The First Avenger that I am fan of that film. After the success of Spielberg's Jurassic Park, Joe Johnston expressed interest in directing a sequel. Spielberg instead gave Joe Johnston permission to direct the third film in the series, if there were to be one. I don't think the director did a terrible job, I think that this movie more lacked on a script writers, so is not Joe Johnston fault for directing this film for using more CGI in the film.I love Sam Neil as Dr. Alan Grant and I love that he goes on an Island Isla Sorna, where man is up against dangerous predators in the ultimate battle for survival. This movie takes no prisoners and pulls no punches. It takes the idea of the original, puts an interesting twist into the plot, injects it with good FX, good acting and a decent budget, and you have something far superior to the original.I like all- new dinosaurs and the special effects CGI, more practical effects are in there, they did not bothered me or that it was directed from someone else and not Steven Spielberg himself. I like the CGI in this film.A wealthy couple with Dr. Alan Grant (Sam Neil) land on a island Isla Sorna and all the mercenaries are killed off, I like that in the film that the mercenaries are killed off. This film is very quickly paced, is not boring film and it is not a dull movie, it does not drag a long, is very interesting to me and it is a good action film. Jurassic park III is MILES way better to me than Jurassic World, I will rather watch this film than the new one. The first time I reviewed this film I hated it, but now I loved it a lot.I am fine with the FX of the Spinosaurus, I like Spinosaurus, I thought it was pretty cool. Btw the kid in this movie wasn't annoying and I think he really did a good job, he was smart and recourses, he was useful in this movie, he survived that length of time by himself & saved Alan against Spinosaurus, so yea I like that and I like this film. I don't think it was terrible or forgettable at all. I really did not like that Laura Dern can't return with her character in a cameo scene, but still I liked that they made her a happy married woman with the kid and I still like that Alan and Ellie are still in contact together, that is decent in the film. Also Michael Jeter from Drop Zone (1994) as a mercenary is in here, John Diehl from Miami Vice is in it and Bruce A. Young from The Sentinel and Basic Instinct (1992) is in it, as a third mercenary. Overall: The ranting for this film I am giving is an 8.5/10 I love this film and In my opinion is the last good Jurassic film, a very hated and underrated. Jurassic Park III is a 2001 American adventure science fiction film. It is the third installment in the Jurassic Park film series. The film stars Sam Neill, William H. Macy, Téa Leoni, Alessandro Nivola, Trevor Morgan, and Michael Jeter. It is the first film in the series not to have been directed by Steven Spielberg, nor based on a book by Michael Crichton (though numerous scenes in the film were ultimately taken from Crichton's novels Jurassic Park and The Lost World).8.5/10 Grade: B+ Studio: Universal Pictures Starring: Sam Neill, William H.

103,petra_ste,A competent failure,5,24 September 2019,"As an action/adventure film, Jurassic Park III achieves basic competence, which is not surprising since it was directed by reliable veteran Joe Johnston. As a sequel of one of the best blockbusters of all time, the first Jurassic Park, it's depressingly mediocre. Gone are the awe and terror of the original; dinosaurs are just other movie monsters chasing the heroes - and this starts about a minute after they land on the island. So long for build-up.There are some small pleasures. The always charismatic Sam Neill is back as Alan Grant... although the movie immediately pulls an Alien 3 on him by revealing that he and Ellie split up and Alan is a miserable loner. I guess it does not *completely* undermine his character arc in Jurassic Park from aloof child-hater to caring protector (one can certainly grow as a person even if he ends up alone), but still.Choosing the Spinosaurus as the main threat was an interesting idea, as it's a cool creature and not as overused as the T-Rex and the Raptors have become. And I really like the moment with the Pterodactyl hobbling out of the fog: it's a striking, memorable image, which is rare for a Jurassic Park sequel.And that's it. Character interactions are perfunctory, most set-pieces nowhere close those of the previous films (I hated The Lost World but it did have a few great action scenes), the premise is stupid (with the little kid surviving on his own on a dinosaur-infested island for weeks) and the ending is a complete deus-ex-machina.(Incidentally, although there are several mentions of ""T-Rex urine"", dinosaurs didn't have urine like mammals do: they emitted it mixed with feces from a cloaca, like birds and reptiles. But that's the least of the film's problems).5,5/10",Jurassic Park III
104,fernandoschiavi,"Jurassic Park III does a more satisfying job than its predecessor in presenting us with more dinosaurs and dangers, but ends up being content compared to its potential",7,14 June 2020,"Jurassic Park was a worldwide phenomenon that captivated the audience by bringing a simple, fun and suspenseful plot, showing the dinosaurs like no other production had achieved before. Due to the resounding success of critics and audiences, it was not long before Michael Crichton - the author of the book on which the first film was based - wrote a sequel, which in turn would give rise to ""The Lost World"". This second, despite many merits, was no longer as fascinating as the previous production, because it is very dark and does not adequately bring the characters we fell in love with previously. While in the first there was a theory for the resurgence of dinosaurs, The Lost World: Jurassic Park (1997) was closer to the classic King Kong (1933), with gigantic monsters invading the great civilized metropolises. Due to the success of the second feature of the dinosaur franchise, it went very well at the box office and as in Hollywood no franchise is exempt from possible continuation, it didn't take long for a third part to be announced.Now in ""Jurassic Park III"", Steven Spielberg returns only as an executive producer and is based on Michael Crichton's literary works - ""The Dinosaur Park"" and ""The Lost World"" -, containing scenes and characters from these. Joe Johnston, known for his work on the excellent ""Darling, I Shrunk the Children (1989)"", ""Jumanji (1995)"" and ""The October Sky (1999)"", was cast as director. Before the definition of the script to be used in Jurassic Park III, two other scripts were discarded by the director. The first narrated the story of six teenagers lost on Ilha Sorna, while the second involved a family adventure and was discarded with only five weeks left to start filming.As the story was being created for Jurassic Park III, the producers wanted another dinosaur to replace the T-Rex from the previous two films and they went through many candidates in search of a replacement. Originally, Barionix was supposed to be the main antagonistic dinosaur in the film, but paleontologist Jack Horner suggested Spinosaurus to producers as a candidate to replace t-rex, since spinosaurus is bigger than barionix and T-Rex, according to Joey Oroscoum, the skull of a spinosaurus was discovered during the pre-production of the film, which inspired producers to use the spinosaurus that is a relative of the barionix. Joey Oroscoum described the discovery as being similar to the way the scientific description of a Utahraptor was released during the making of the first film in the franchise. Before being discarded, a storyboard and a version of the logo for the film were made with the barionix. In this respect, the choice for spinosaurus is correct. It's the kind of scene that a child dreams of seeing: a giant dinosaur taking down a small plane and kicking it back and forth as if it were a simple soccer ball. All done with wonderful practical effects, and which maintains a level of realism and execution that is very credible to this day. And what better way to introduce the new monster in the saga than by putting it to fight a tyrannosaurus, and breaking its neck in the process? The problem is that what should be a striking scene, putting the two monsters to face each other, is anti-climactic strangeness, a recurring problem throughout the film.
But of course, Johnston couldn't leave the velociraptors out. Here, we have a number of inspired situations involving predators, which now reveal their ability to communicate with each other through specific grunts, and also to set traps and surround the poor humans lost there. Johnston really enjoys himself during the scene where Amanda inspects the abandoned laboratory, finding pieces of skeletons, poorly developed fetuses and other traces of the company's genetic work, until he comes face to face with a seemingly frozen raptor head - until his pupil moves and jump scare catching us. The big news, however, comes with pterodonts. For the first time in the series we have flying dinosaurs, and the work of puppets - and CGI - on these sinister birds is impressive, as is the conduct of the scene that takes place inside a labyrinthine cage; and Shelly Johnson's photography is wise in using the heavy fog of the landscape to hide threats, yielding one of the most terrifying plans in the entire series, when we see one of the pterodonts slowly approaching the camera. Incidentally, the dinosaurs in animatronic are the most realistic of the whole franchise, no matter how much they say that the CGI is flawed, the robots do not leave anything to be desired, the texture, the sparkle in the eyes and each expression of the Velociraptores is as if they were animals they really are there on screen and in moments when puppets and CGI animation are mixed the mixture of the two on the same plane is fluid and not remarkable.It is a pity that we don't care much for any of the characters, and the script fails to try to build some conflict between Alan and Billy (the expressionless Alessandro Nivola), or to repair the marriage between Paul and Amanda, both narratives that mix with the persecutions of the dinosaurs. The Kirby couple's relationship is completely unlikely. As much as the film makes it clear that they did not get along so well and were divorced for some years, it is implied that during events on the island they rediscover that passion that they had and return to being a normal family with their son.... There is no sweeter story, luckily in the film it was only hinted at. Perhaps even more tragic, is to see Ellie (Laura Dern), one of the best characters in the series, relegated to a mere special appearance. Okay that even with little screen time, she is still responsible for the rescue of Grant and the Kirby family.The technical highlights even go to the photography of Shelly Johnson, who explores many daytime scenes, to get rid of the gloomy atmosphere of the second film for good and aim to give it more air and adventure, recovering the atmosphere of the original film. But that does not prevent us from having incredible scenes like the one where the characters visit the ""nursery"" of the dinosaurs, or else in the action scenes with rain and fog that yield excellent moments of tension. We still have the soundtrack by Don Davis (from the Matrix trilogy), who manage to pass the atmosphere of adventure and suspense in a very competent way, as well as use the themes immortalized by John Williams at appropriate times.As in the other films in the series, the visual effects are impressive, perfectly recreating details, animals that existed millions of years ago, and now with confrontational scenes with even greater impact, giving more place for violence and horror than the previous ones. . But the script remains obvious and full of clichés, with situations that border on the ridiculous. The boy, after falling on the island and his stepfather dying in the fall, manages to survive for two months alone in a completely wild and aggressive place, full of carnivorous dinosaurs. In real situations, for a small group of simple humans lost in a hostile dinosaur-infested environment, it would be literally impossible to survive for long. And to give the film the necessary atmosphere, they still successfully face several dinosaurs, among them, a huge rabid spinosaurus and a group of velociraptors, super agile and intelligent animals, as well as flying birds like pterodactyls.""Jurassic Park III"" seems to be completely uninterested in turning the dinosaurs into menacing creatures. Each confrontation is resolved in an absurd way that would not be totally out of place in an episode of Tom & Jerry. Whether Billy running away from pteranodons with a parachute or Alan ""talking"" to velociraptors using a 3D printed larynx, it's hard to think that this film is part of the same series. The larger budget of the trilogy did not prevent the action scenes from appearing simulated in a scenario. Random dinosaur attacks produce no apparent fear and are ineffective in the face of an irregular plot. The obligation to insert new species takes the characters to places not previously explored, as a crossing by the sea only as a pretext for the action scene with the flying dinosaur. Episodic scenes that try to impact the plot without emotion. The sensation of an unfinished work is even more evident when the plot ends briefly, without a third dramatic act. An anti-climax that seems to end the story in advance due to lack of time to develop a suitable script. Not even the final scene is unpublished, resembling the end of the first film, with the characters leaving the island, entitled to John Williams' original music as a reminder to the public that this plot was part of a trilogy.This third part does not have the grandeur, the spectacle of previous adventures. It is noted that it is a smaller scale film and seeks to resume the narrative of the original film, leaving aside the excess of characters in the second part. Jurassic Park III does a more satisfying job than its predecessor in presenting us with more dinosaurs and dangers, but ends up being content with very little compared to its potential. Several different concepts were experienced during the pre-production, leading to a narrative and script instability present even during filming, where certain scenes were written or finished on the spot. Peter Buchman, Jim Taylor and Alexander Payne worked together on the text, whose structural and narrative simplicity is so evident that it is difficult to imagine how it could have been difficult to execute and plan. In their short duration, the characters have the direct objective of finding the lost boy and escaping from the island, and although this simplicity and speed of events guarantees more shallow characters (although Sam Neill's charisma always pays off), it makes the experience lighter and even close to a matinee, since Johnston's only intention here is to entertain, something he does relatively well.",Jurassic Park III
105,Rogue-32,They could have called it SNORASSIC PARK!,4,18 July 2001,"Sam Neill is a wonderful actor and Stan Winston did an incredible job with the creatures, but this is one franchise that aint cuttin' it any longer. It's not boring, mind you, but it aint exactly edge-of-yer-seat, hold-on-to-yer-popcorn-bag neither. It just lopes along in a predictable, plodding way until it's over, and then you leave.

I think it's a great film to I believe ends the Jurassic Park trilogy unless Hollywood gets greedy and decides to crank out a fourth film. The special effects aren't as magical as they used to be, but the movie does enchant with homages to Land of the Lost, The Last Dinosaur, Peter Pan and Dinosaurus. Sam O'Neil repises his role from the first movie wonderfully and convincingly, and although Tea Leoni proves to become a great actress, I still don't think she's that attractive. William H. Macy rounds out the cast with his usual style and scope, but like everyone else, they are merely co-stars to the dinosaurs themselves.",Jurassic Park III
107,russem31,So-so,6,3 December 2005,"Just like the dismal Lost World, this one fails to recapture the classic spirit of the first Jurassic Park. It's in fact disappointingly short too - 90 minutes compared to the 120 minute length of the first two films. AGAIN, they go to the island and AGAIN fight dinosaurs (including a ridiculous new one). It's same old, same old. Also, the score by Don Davis is much too tame - he does try to recapture John Williams' music of the first and second films but just can't do as great a job (Don Davis FYI is a great composer though having done a wonderful job on the Matrix trilogy). I know there will be a Jurassic Park IV and I hope Steven Spielberg will have more of a hand in it than he did with this one (he didn't direct this one). 6 out of 10.",Jurassic Park III
108,Jack the Ripper1888,Far better than the second film. What summer audiences are dying to see! *spoilers*,10,29 July 2002,"JURASSIC PARK III was most likely the biggest summer blockbuster of 2001. I saw it three times at the theater, and each time, the theater was packed. The film is a non-stop action ride. I loved it!It has been yet another four years, and Dr. Alan Grant (Sam Neill) and his assistant, Billy (Alessandro Nivola) have just been tricked into escorting a wealthy couple (William H. Macy and Tea Leoni) to the place that Grant dreads the most. The island which is inhabited by the deadly dinosaurs. Escorted by Mr. Udesky (Michael Jeter) and his two mercenary assistants (John Deihl and Bruce A. Young) they must struggle to stay alive after a harrowing plane crash leaves them stranded.The remaining cast includes Trevor Morgan, Mark Harelik, Julio Oscar Mechoso and Laura Dern in a smaller role than the first film. Now, the action sequences are very intense and the action never seems to slow down. It holds on to you and doesn't let you go until it ends. Altogether, a vast improvement over THE LOST WORLD: JURASSIC PARK. Now, it is the summer of 2002. Exactly one year later and already films are out that try to compete with this film. REIGN OF FIRE and EIGHT LEGGED FREAKS are heavy competition for the title of ""Summer Blockbuster of the Year"". And of course, MINORITY REPORT is not far behind. But, during the summer of the year 2001, JURASSIC PARK III was the greatest action epic I had seen so far. JURASSIC PARK III gets 5/5.",Jurassic Park III
109,Atreyu_II,"Better than expected, but not as good as the first one",6,13 March 2011,"After the 2nd one having been such a disappointment, I wasn't expecting much from the 3rd. Surprisingly it is considerably better than the 2nd, even though it obviously doesn't match the greatness of the original. While not a great movie, it was at least okay. Its story was a little better, the scenario improved, Alan Grant is back (that also makes the difference) and so is his female co-worker. Alan Grant isn't as fun as he is in the original, but still his return did a lot for this movie.Cinematography is a great improvement over the 2nd one, but doesn't reach the level of the first one.This one also had too much characters, which were also too annoying and unnecessary. But still I liked Trevor Morgan's character and his performance. I knew I knew that kid from somewhere, but I didn't realize at the time it was him. Only after looking for the list of actors in this film, I found his name and realized he is one of the kids from 'The Sixth Sense'.Gone are characters such as Ian Malcolm, John Hammond, Lex and Tim, etc...At least in one thing both sequels are comparable to the original: the amazingness of the dinosaurs (how great and real they look and their awesome roars and impeccable animation). Also, both sequels bring back the fabulous score by John Williams, but there ain't any doubts that the sequels aren't the same thing as the original. There is no way they could be, even if Spielberg directed them (he actually directed the 2nd one but not this one).",Jurassic Park III

The film does not have much of a plot, and the characters themselves are pretty one-dimensional. Like the other films, it just plays on special effects and dinosaurs to kill off the characters - or to drive them mad. This film did try to have more of a plot, but it failed miserably. The whole aspect of the dinosaurs and communication was a little cheesy, and I don't think that the dinosaurs would let them out alive just because they managed to make the right sounds.

Then, we are supposed to believe that another group of people could go and the government would do nothing. We are just leaving the island of death open to the public? Yes, the f/x are good, but they are good in the original and it has a story to go with the visuals. This is a waste of the talents of Sam Neill, William H. Macy, and Laura Dern.

The second movie stunk up the place-- but this third movie version was insulting. Sam Neil, bless his heart, appeared so old, distracted, and tired in this movie. He was such a downer, I was rooting for some dinosaur to eat his bummer butt. William H. Macy is a champ. A brilliant actor, and by all accounts, a wonderful person as well. Tea Leoni is also a champ, and a treasure. And a babe. But despite their valiant efforts, even their glowing presence couldn't save this turkey. All of the supporting cast were completely inconsequential. As they died off, one could only wonder if their characters' deaths brought the movie any closer to ending. One good point, although not nearly enough to make this movie worth your time, is the quaint 1950's sci-fi vibe. Some of the linguistic talents and high intelligence ascribed to the ""monsters"" in this movie reminded me of ""Invasion of the Ant People,"" or some such. If I had been drunk, and sitting with a batch of drunken friends at a fraternity or dorm, we'd have been laughing and hooting our fannies off. As it was, I kept my yawns to myself, so as to not disturb the experience of the 5 and 6 year-olds in the audience. I have fond memories of the cheap, cheesey junk I saw at the local theater with my little brother and my friends when we were all very young. Great nostalgia for me as an adult.

These scenes include the pteranodon and river boat sequences.2014 the evidence that indicated that Spinosaurus was not a land animal. This was a creature adapted to life in the water, floating like a crocodile with paddle-like feet. On land, the Spinosaurus had walked on four legs. Therefore, if Spinosaurus would fight with other large predators, the battle look very different from the one in the movie. Paul Sereno said that when Spinosaurus emerged on land, it probably didn't brawl with other predators. ""Big predators would likely have stayed away from fighting each other"", Ibrahim says. ""Whichever one got in the first big bite would have probably won a fight."" In this movie, it is the Tyrannosaurus that got the first big bite and should have won the fight. Also, with a bite force of 3.5-23.5 metric tons, the T. Rex should have bitten the Spinosaur's head off. But, it's a fictional story, so anything is possible

In retaliation, the unlucky human desperately hides inside the plane part he or she has reached as the Spino begins rolling the plane's nose before using its head to push the plane part onto its tip. The sail-backed dinosaur then sticks its head inside the front of the plane where it finds the pilot and flings him or her up in the air where the human falls into the Spino's mouth. Furthermore, instead of the Spino losing the protagonists via getting its head stuck in-between two trees, Delgado's concept art shows that the Spino was to be trapped in a group of fallen trees apparently caused by a mudslide. During the filming of this scene, the Spino animatronic malfunctioned. When it was sticking its head inside the body of the plane, it instead began slamming into the plane ""like a jackhammer"" as Director Joe Johnston described the malfuction.
According to the Dino Protection Group website, InGen scientists travelled back to Isla Sorna in 1999 and illegally cloned 4 new species. These species are Ankylosaurus, Corythosaurus, Ceratosaurus and Spinosaurus, whom all made their debut in this film.

119,Movie-12,"Works on the basis that you don't expect something remotely as fascinating as the original, but still hunger for a shallow 90 minute thrill ride. *** (out of four)",7,12 August 2001,"JURASSIC PARK 3 / (2001) *** (out of four)By Blake French:	""Jurassic Park 3"" is not as good as the first but a whole lot better than the second. It's also the first film in the series that is not based on a novel by Michael Crichton. That's basically ""JP3"" in a nutshell. It's not necessarily a great movie, nor does it break any new grounds of adventure or take many risks, but it does take advantage of all the creative ideas. You will not hear anyone in the audience complain that the movie isn't inventive, because these writers, Peter Buchman, Alexander Payne, and Jim Taylor, really have an imagination. 	The story takes place eight years after the incident at Jurassic Park. Dr. Alan Grant (Sam Neill) still works as a paleontologist on dinosaur dig sites in Montana with his young assistant Billy (Alessandro Nivola). He's offered a good sum of money by a wealthy couple (William H. Macy and Tea Leoni) who want Grant to guild them on a flight over Isla Sorna-also owned by the dinosaur cooperation. Sam agrees, but once over the island, something goes wrong and he's once again stuck on the dinosaur infested territory fighting for his life.   	""Jurassic Park 3"" is complied with stunning brevity. The dialogue is concise and doesn't wonder. The character's relationships are instantly obvious. It's very clear that this film is shorter, cheaper, and more simple than its predecessors. That is not such a bad thing. The second Jurassic Park was terrible-an all star cast placed in situation and situation where they run from big monstrous creatures. Although ""Jurassic Park 3"" is more or less the same formula, it gets sassy and fresh. Eye-popping special effects involve everything from a bird-dinosaur attempting to feed a human to its babies to a massive battle between a Tyrannosaurus Rex and a new breed of lizard called Spinosaurus. Some of these scenes do not really work. Amazingly, many succeed. I have various complaints about the movie. There are not enough violent encounters to keep the audiences interested throughout. Unlike the first two films, the dinos in ""JP3"" only eat a handful of characters and they occur in the opening half hour. You can probably guess the characters who meet a graphic demise; anyone who is billed in the film's credits that you have heard of will probably live. I also think the movie needs more thrills. It seems as if the producers are more interested in proving to the audience that these dinosaurs are really smart rather than focusing on lean, clean terror.Regardless of the pictures many problems, during a summer movie season jam-packed with special effects extravaganzas that don't work (""The Mummy Returns,"" ""Pearl Harbor,"" ""Planet of the Apes,"" ""The Fast and he Furious,"" and ""Swordfirsh"" to name a few) finally comes one that does. I recommend ""Jurassic Park 3"" on the basis that you don't expect something remotely as fascinating as the original, but still hunger for a shallow 90 minute thrill ride.",Jurassic Park III
120,virek213,"Slightly lesser sequel, but it still works",7,30 July 2001,"JURASSIC PARK 3 brings back Sam Neill as Alan Grant (with Laura Dern in a cameo as Ellie Sattler) in this third dinosaur installment.  This time, Neill is virtually bribed by a divorced couple (Tea Leoni, William H. Macy) to go with them to Isla Sorna (Site 'B') to find their son, who was stranded there eight weeks before on a parasailing excursion.  Naturally, of course, this means setting foot amongst the dinosaurs once again--and this time, something new has been added: a spineosaurus!The special effects are still as good as ever (thanks to Stan Winston and ILM).  I wasn't as convinced by the actors this time around, however.  Leoni and Macy, although good, are not what Neill, Dern, and Jeff Goldblum had been in the first two movies.  The reason may be that the director here is Joe Johnston (JUMANJI) and not Steven Spielberg.  This isn't to say that Johnston isn't a good director, however (he was Spielberg's aerial sequence designer on ALWAYS).  It's just that his specialty is creatures more so than people.  Contrary to what some may think, Spielberg is as much a director of ACTORS as he is of THINGS (UFOs, dinosaurs, sharks, etc.).This is still, however, a very good film (and at 95 minutes unusually short), which is why I give it a 7.",Jurassic Park III
121,gigan-92,The Tragic Trilogy Factor,5,3 June 2010,"Grade C+ Ugh, the third film is a guaranteed tragedy when a new director is handed the legacy. This fact is a house-hold term factor for Hollywood by now. Joe Johnson pieces together the best story they could manage and it gets the job done I guess.Sam Neil is dragged into this mediocre 90-minute tale, along with William H. Macy and Tea' Leoni. The comedy is off-beat and doesn't fit the film but enough of the bad. On the positive side, are dinosaurs are looking better than ever. It seems the color scheme has drastically altered; every dinosaur now is as bright as a tropical bird. I'm disappointed the Spinosaurus vs. T-Rex battle is set up at right at the beginning. The ending to me is kind of weak. IF anything that should've been the climatic end scene with the T-Rex taking victory. Probably the thing that lacked the most in this film. Don Davis does a decent score, but John Williams can never be topped.The trilogy factor will haunt movies forever",Jurassic Park III
122,FlickJunkie-2,"Great visuals, weak screenplay",6,19 January 2002,"While this film contains technological advancements over the first two and presents the return of Sam Neill, the franchise seems to have run out of ideas and resorts to one big game of dodge the dinosaur.  I guess they figured that it is better to have no story than a stupid story (see JPII). Dr. Allen Grant (Neill) is tricked into returning to dinoland by a couple trying to find their son, who was lost on the island in an inane parasailing accident in the opening scene.  Once there, it is the movie version of `Survivor' where the creatures carnivorously vote the cast off the island. The chase begins very early in the film, pre-empting any hope of a meaningful storyline.
Director Joe Johnston started his career as an art director, doing visual effects for `Star Wars', so it is no surprise that this film emphasizes visual effects.  In this respect it is superlative.  The integration of computer generated images and animaltronics is state of the art and brings us a realism that could barely be surpassed by being amidst the dinosaurs in real life.  They have improved the look and movement of the dinosaurs and have integrated them more realistically with the actors.  Despite having a lower entertainment value from a screenplay perspective, this film is pure genius as regards visual effects and uses vanguard techniques that will surely become commonplace in sci-fi films of the future. There is not much to be said about the acting.  There isn't much meaningful dialogue.  All the actors are effective at looking terrified and then looking relieved only to be terrified again five minutes later. The only way I can rate this film is to average two components.  The story is a 2/10 and the technical component is a 10/10.  So I'd have to give it a 6/10.  It is worth seeing just for the visuals, but don't waste your time if a strong screenplay is your primary consideration in selecting a film.",Jurassic Park III

124,mfellipecampos,Very good,8,22 November 2019,"Jurassic Park III is a 2001 American sci-fi adventure movie directed by Joe Johnston, written by Michael Crichton, Alexander Payne, Jim Taylor and Peter Buchman and produced by Steven Spielberg, Kathleen Kennedy and Larry J. Franco, being the sequel to The Lost World: Jurassic Park, 1997. The feature film is part of the Jurassic Park franchise, being the third in the movie series and the direct sequel to The Lost World: Jurassic Park. It is the first of the saga without the direction of Steven Spielberg. The plot of the film revolves around Alan Grant's new visit to Jurassic Park dinosaurs. Despite being shaken by his last encounter with these dinosaurs, Grant continues to devote his life to studying them, and develops a theory about the development of intelligence of the Velociraptors. Desperate for funds to continue his research, he accepts the offer of Paul Kirby and Amanda Kirby, two would-be millionaires who want to take a tour of Sorna Island who want Grant's company on this tour. However, during the tour, Alan discovers the real intention of the Kirby, which is to go down to the island to look for his son Eric, who disappeared there on an expedition 8 weeks earlier. Despite Grant's opposition, they land on the island and end up being attacked by a new species of dinosaur, bigger and fiercer than Tyrannosaurus (the main antagonist of the first two films of the saga), Spinosaurus. The film would tell the story of six lost teenagers on Sorna Island, not a family adventure! Chose family adventure, if choosing from six lost teenagers on Sorna Island would be too bad, so chose family adventure and it worked out very well for me. My movie rating is 8.0.Movie watched on May 12, 2019",Jurassic Park III
125,meydiana-65242,First Ramadan in 2021 I watch this movie.,7,12 April 2021,"This time, it's not just a walk in the park. The third installment in everyone's favorite dinosaur blockbuster franchise. Paleontologist Alan Grant from the first film has ended his relationship with his former partner Ellie Sattler, though they are still good friends. Dr. Grant now works with his new assistant Billy Brennan, who have recently made a fascinating discovery on raptors. However, they are facing a problem: they are running out of money for their research. Luckily, Paul and Amanda Kirby, a wealthy couple willing to offer them enough money to continue their research, if they give them an aerial tour of Isla Sorna. Grant and Billy reluctantly agree, despite Grant mentioning earlier in the film that he would never visit Site B. They then head off on an airplane to the island. However, their plane shortly crash-lands in the jungle, leaving Grant and the survivors stranded there. The Kirbys then reveal the real reason they brought Grant here: they are a middle-class divorced couple searching for their lost son Eric who crashed on the island a few weeks earlier. Grant is furious about being tricked, but soon learns they have bigger problems. InGen has been creating deadlier and advanced breeds of dinosaurs. This results in another battle for survival between man and nature. Jurassic Park 3 is not an astounding sequel. It lacks the magic and charm of Spielberg's film. And that's not just because the film feels like a network drama episode. The main problem with this movie is dumb human characters. The only likeable characters that really stood out to me were Alan Grant (obviously) and the Kirby kid, Eric. The rest of them weren't very interesting. The film spends way too much time on its boring characters instead of the giant dinosaurs, whom I wished to see get eaten. Especially the Kirby couple who are stereotypical and constantly arguing over their marriage and lives. Amanda was more annoying as she kept putting everyone in danger, thanks to her foolishness. The film is also basically just a chase scene. On more positive notes, the film is much better than The Lost World: Jurassic Park (my dearest apologies to Mr. Spielberg) as it just gets straight to the point where dinosaurs start eating people. I would also like to point out Grant's dream sequence where a raptor ""speaks"" to him was quite amusing to watch, despite its stupidity. Don Davis's score is suspenseful and tense, with elements of John Williams' original theme. Joe Johnston is definitely no Spielberg, but proves he is capable of directing an effective thrill ride that will leave you hanging on the seat in suspense.",Jurassic Park III

Anyway...on with JP3...JP3 was a great movie!  First of all, the special effects are incredible!!!  There are some scenes that put my jaw on the floor because the dino looked sooo real.  As far as story goes, this film is nothing terribly complicated, but that is just fine with me.  I went into the movie to see some dinos, and I got just that.  I think I liked the story because it's simple, but feasible (given that Jurassic Park exists)!  Also, it doesn't throw in a bunch of useless, lame sub-plot points (like the girl in JP2 being a gymnast).  I would agree that the movie was a bit short, but that wasn't anything I couldn't deal with, it was a short and sweet movie. The acting was fine as far as I could tell, I didn't have any problems with it.  One thing you have to keep in mind is that these actors are acting with nothing in the shot, or if there is something to act against, it isn't anything mildly intimidating.  I give all the actors props for being able to make it believable.  I noticed that some people on this site said that they thought the ending was horrible, I disagree, I thought it was fine.All in all, I'd have to say that if you like both of the other JP films then it's probably safe to say you'll like this one.  But if you didn't like one or the other, you may be disappointed.  I'll leave you with this, don't go into the theater expecting a thought-provoking, deep movie, just sit back and be entertained.  Also, appreciate the dinosaurs, a lot of people put a lot of effort into making the dinos look that good, so give them some credit.  Thanks for reading,-Cortex",Jurassic Park III
128,OriginalMovieBuff21,A Bad Sequel,5,29 May 2004,"Jurassic Park III is the worst out of the Jurassic Park trilogy. It failed in making a great film. The spinosauros just disturbed me throughout the movie of how stupid and dull it was to be the main dinosaur of the movie. T-Rex has been my ultimate favorite dinosaur and Joe Johnston made the stupid spinosauros kill it. The T-Rex was amazing and even the scientists said it was the most fiercest dinosaur on the planet. Why did they make the spinosauros be the best. Paleontologists haven't even found all of the fossils of the spinosauros. Sorry, but that just makes me mad that they would put the spinosauros the fiercest when the T-Rex was. But, I did like the raptors in the movie. They were very neat and the raptors were the ones that were the mostly entertaining throughout the movie. I guess this was an entertaining despite the stupid spinosauros and the bad acting this could've been a good film.5/10",Jurassic Park III

Rather it's more a display in movie magic, what computers allow us to do. Because of this i have no real masterpiece-expectations on any of the sequels either. And this is somewhat entertaining, which might be enough.The main problem with this movie is the fact that the whole concept of rampaging dinosaurs is becoming a bit old. We have seen it in two movies before this one, and nothing indicated that this would be any different compared to the first two installments. And that was also the fact. More or less we are treated to 1,5 hours of people running and screaming with dinosaurs on their tail.I don't know if it's a good thing that Sam Neill is back. Granted, nobody can look as stunned as he does every time he sees something strange. But otherwise he doesn't feel very energetic about the whole thing. The one that really stands out in the cast is Tea Leoni though. She is abominable. She runs through the forest screaming at the top of her lungs. If i were in the movie i would crack her over the head and leave her for dead before the dinosaurs got a chance to...All in all i guess this is entertaining enough. But mostly it should appeal to the fans of the first two movies. It has little new to offer, mostly it's just a repetition of things we are already familiar with.

The aim I guess that the people behind the scenes were aiming for was a family movie with a bit of suspends and while there is a family movie to be had here, it also tries to be a Jurassic Park film and unfortunately it fails as both to a degree.It fails as a family movie cause the script is not strong enough to support the story. Despite the venom thrown at William H Macy and especially Tea Leoni, both are very appealing actors and they do work hard to make it all work but the script just handicap their efforts to make it possible. It fails as a Jurassic Park film cause it lacks the tension, suspense and the story points that made the first two films in the series ( Jurassic Park And The Lost World) so well made and memorable. Not to mention the fact that they felt like fully formed movies with a beginning, middle and end. Jurassic Park 3 just feels like a Saturday morning serial. Not bad but nothing like the other films in the series. There is one scene in the film that almost manages to bring a little tension which is the bird cage scene but even that ends up flat compared to any of the scenes in the other films of the series. The other major problem is the fact that While Sam Neill works his ass off to make this film watchable, the script does the most disservice to the character of Alan Grant, whose happy ending from the original Jurassic Park was not only ruined thanks to this movie but has his character dumb down in order to fall for the dumb stuff that happens in this film. Despite all of this, Sam Neill is working overtime to make you care.

Just because Steven Spielberg directed the previous two Jurassic Park adventures, this one being directed by Joe Johnston (October Sky 1999, Jumanji 1995, The Rocketeer 1991) raises the curiosity of how good/fun it can be. Under the 'simply wanted to see it' motivation, I found suspense, thrills, drama and action for teenagers, parents, faithful Jurassic Park followers (Sam Neill's back, and Laura Dern briefly appears), and just about for everyone who wants to be entertained and enjoys survival storylines. (We are reminded that Sam was not in ""The Lost World: JP2."")Welcome to Isla Sorna - JP3. It is one continuous adventurous ride, with no overlong drawn out action sequences. There are plenty of cliffhangers to keep your adrenaline going for an hour and 33 mins. Subliminally it felt longer - it was well edited, with not a moment wasted, providing just the right amount of 'breathing' segments along the way to let you pick up little details/clues in following the story. You may say it's a tidy script: there's not a line of dialog that was trivial. There are reasons why each key character is there and why something's said, and amidst all the adventurous urgencies with the effective menacing Stan Winston's dino-creatures, you'll click and realize it was no passing remark that was uttered earlier by Tea Leoni as Mom, William H. Macy as Dad, Trevor Morgan as Eric the son, or Alessandro Nivola's Billy, assistant to Sam Neill's Dr. Grant. Even the brief scene of the little boy (as the son of Laura Dern) pausing in front of a TV screen provided a 'close encounter' suspenseful moment. Hm.There are fleeting reminders of Hitchcock's The Birds, jungle aura of Tarzan flicks, a rescue moment from Gold Diggers: The Secret of Bear Mountain, and Rob Cohen's Dragonheart. The camera's everywhere: right on the water surface, high up in the air, close-up on faces, down amidst the jungle and trees, bringing us to previous Jurassic Park locales, going underwater, struggling along on a half-capsized boat during an eventful downpour The indispensable sound effects, and additional new music by Don Davis (along with reprise of John William's original JP theme) rounded off the excitement from this Universal Pictures and Amblin Entertainment adventure fare.",Jurassic Park III

He meets with an entrepreneur (William H.

135,harryplinkett14,Hunt for more money,1,28 December 2013,"The original Jurassic Park was exciting mainly because of the dinosaurs and the special effects, but the characters, the dialogue, and the overall plot were rather dull.By the third film the characters, the dialogue and the plot have all become much worse, and in addition to that the dinosaurs are no longer that interesting. The end result is a dull, unimaginative film filled with stupid characters, unrealistic plot twists, and not so impressive CGI creatures. This film wastes no time to introduce us to the characters, but it does not bother to develop them. Most of them die pretty quickly anyway. Of course, we are introduced to a child in the latter half of the film, and this character manages to be more irritating than all the rest combined. Apparently he has been living all alone for two months, evading giant meat-eaters and actually having fun. He almost seems sad that the show is over and shows no emotional reaction to the fact that he is not only being rescued, but that his parents are on the dino-infested island. It all ends with a deus ex machina that overshadows the one from the first film (of course, they could not use that one, because they used it early in the film, in a scene where they are saved from a dinosaur by having another dinosaur show up and start a fight with it, allowing the characters to escape in the confusion). Does anyone know how many islands inhabited by dinosaurs there are, and who is in charge? Who cares? There are people being chased by dinosaurs, and that's what you paid to see, right? So shut up and stop asking questions.This film was made for no other reason but to squeeze even more money from the franchise, and it exhibits no traces of genuine desire to create something artistic.

It is successful? Yes and No. Familiar characteristics are found in this movie, such as the return of Sam Neill and Laura Dern, as well as the theme and the dinosaurs. The visual effects are amazing as always, although they did seem a bit disappointing at certain points. The full scale animatronic models moved liked models a few times, and the CGI movement seemed a bit off, but nothing noticeable. The real problems i have with this film is the length and the finale. This film is just too short, compared to the previous two films, with the film seeming a bit similar to the original. A lot of the different turns in the films, such as deaths should have gone a different route. The ending was also disappointing and looked quite silly.

137,jhaggardjr,Surprisingly good second sequel,8,23 July 2001,"Here is the sequel that I've been dying to see all year. I'm a huge ""Jurassic Park"" fan. I loved the first two movies in the series, and now comes the third movie ""Jurassic Park III"". I wasn't sure that I would like this one as much as the first two films since Steven Spielberg decided not to return as director (he does return as executive producer). But to my astonishing surprise, I really did enjoy this second sequel to the big box-office smash from 1993. It's not quite as good as ""Jurassic Park"" and just a step down from ""The Lost World"". ""Jurassic Park III"" is a movie that is so much fun that I didn't particularly care if the story was weak (which it is). I would have to say the storyline of ""Jurassic Park III"" is weaker by comparison to the first two films. However, when I go to see a ""Jurassic Park"" movie I go to see it for two reasons: action scenes and special effects. And ""Jurassic Park III"" delivers on both accounts big time. Sam Neill returns as Dr. Alan Grant, the dinosaur expert from the first film who vows that nothing could persuade him to return to that island populated by genetically engineered dinosaurs. But one day an estranged couple (William H. Macy and Tea Leoni) ask him to be their guide in a plane trip over the dinosaur island Isla Sorna (where most of the events in ""The Lost World"" took place). Then things don't go exactly as planned. The plane crashes on the island, and now Grant, the couple, and a few others spent most of the time running from dinosaurs. The couple apparently hide a secret from Dr. Grant. The main reason why they're traveling to Isla Sorna is that their young son (Chicago native Trevor Morgan, who you might remember from the movies ""The Sixth Sense"" and ""The Patriot"") gets trapped on the island after his parasail crashes, and they're trying to rescue him. Sure this premise is ridiculous, and there is quite a bit of stupidity throughout. But hey, this is a summer B-movie that is entertaining from start to finish. The performances are nothing special, but it's fun to watch these actors running from dinosaurs. It's nice to see Neill back in what has got to be by now his most famous role, and also encoring from the first film is Laura Dern, who turns up in a cameo as Dr. Ellie Sattler. But obviously the real stars of the movie are the great special effects. These dinosaur effects are super, no doubt about it. The T-rexes and the raptors are back along with a couple of new dinosaurs, which  includes the huge Spinosaurus and the flying Pteranodons. They steal the movie, as they did in the first two outings. The director of this outing is Joe Johnston, who specializes in special effects pictures (""Honey, I Shrunk the Kids"", ""Jumanji"") and even though it may not be as good as Spielberg's two ""JP"" movies, he does an effective job nevertheless. The thing that surprised me the most about ""Jurassic Park III"" was it's short running time (92 minutes). The first two movies ran about 2 hours long. That didn't bother me at all. In fact, it was kind of nice to see a short movie for a change. So many movies nowadays run overlong and they don't need to be. Here is a film that's just good fun. And at least it's great to see that this ""Jurassic Park"" series hasn't disintegrated as badly as the ""Jaws"" movies did. *** (out of four)",Jurassic Park III
138,Al_The_Strange,"""On this island there is no such thing as safe.""",7,14 June 2015,"For a third time, dinosaurs terrorize people. This time, the people stumble across Site B (from the second movie), finding it a derelict place overrun by prehistoric wildlife, including bigger, badder, and smarter creatures.There are a few good thrills to be had with Jurassic Park III. At this point, the special effects have been refined to look sharper and move smoother, and there are still some huge animatronics being employed. Thus, you get a lot of good-looking dinosaurs running loose chasing people all over the island. This includes the epic Spinosaurous, which makes its introduction by fighting and defeating a T-Rex in mortal combat. There are also raptors everywhere, which use more cunning than before to hunt down their prey. On top of that, there's also some Pteranodons in a giant ""bird cage"" (from a scene that was in the original novel but never used before). The dinosaur action is modestly satisfying and pretty fun.Unfortunately, the story leaves much to be desired. It is great to see Dr. Grant returning as the protagonist (and Dr. Sattler in a smaller role), but he winds up being surrounded by a bunch of the dumbest dorks imaginable. The whole plot revolves around an estranged and dippy couple that lost their son; they go so far as tricking and manipulating Grant and his protégé to the island. Once they all finally get there, it's just one dumb move after another, followed by lots of running and screaming. The film becomes a bit more endearing with the chase scenes, and the characters' human sides become apparent, but there are still some dumb things that happen that ruin all creditability (including watching a smartphone travel through a dinosaur's digestive system and somehow work underwater to relay an unintelligible message that somehow prompts the military to show up in the end...yeah right). Of all the faults with this film, however, the one thing that's always bothered me the most is that there's nothing new involved; it's just another island adventure with little connection to previous events, and nowhere else to go. The movie doesn't advance the arc of the series at all (though I haven't seen Jurassic World just yet, I have a feeling you can skip this one no problem), so it comes off as a mere throwaway adventure.This film has good-looking photography, including some decent POV shots. Editing is solid. Sam Neill is as fun to watch as ever. Laura Dern is barely in the movie; what little screen time she has is fine and dandy. William H. Macey and Téa Leoni are excellent at playing the dippiest characters imaginable; Trevor Morgan does a fine job in his role; all the mercenary characters are fun to watch, and everybody else is just peachy. Writing is pretty weak, and there's hardly any dialogue that stands out. This production uses decent-looking sets, props, costumes, locales, and special effects. Music rehashes all the old themes.This film has its share of cool action, and it often tries to recapture the same sense of wonder and whimsey that made the first film endearing. However, the plot doesn't hold much water, the characters are frustrating, and the whole movie doesn't leave as much of a lasting impact as the last two.3/5 (Experience: Average | Story: Marginal | Film: Pretty Good)",Jurassic Park III
139,chrisbrown6453,"A long time in the making, should have been longer.",6,20 June 2002,"Six weeks before the start of principal photography, director Joe Johnston tossed out the Jurassic Park 3 script, opting to write a new one off the cuff, and conducting his production with often only a day long advance on the next two or three page installment. This is how Johnston, cast and crew made their way through a 100 million dollar motion picture. But I don't need to tell you any of this. Whether you've heard the news or not, it'll all become patently obvious if and when you cross paths with this action-smart, story-stupid sequel.Like the wrecked buildings and ravaged genetic laboratories that Dr. Alan Grant visits when he finds himself stranded on an island of dinosaurs, the third Jurassic effort stands as only a hollowed, corpse-like reminder of the original, raided of all back-plot and substance. Where there were once potent ethical implications, there is now: action. Where there was once social commentary, there is now: action. But who's to blame here? Where else could Johnston have gone with this relatively exhausted ongoing ""storyline""? The industry executive setup: We've got a huge market for an island full of dinosaurs, but no rational or convincing reason as to why any character would end up there. The industry executive solution: We don't need a reason. Lighten up. Have fun. If you're smiling, then we aren't technically ""stealing"" your money.But perhaps this is all overburdening the issue. Sam Neil does do a good job of re-hashing lines that read like water-doused kindling; ""We probably won't get off this island alive,"" ""This is playing God,"" you know the drill. Any issues his dramatic, monotone dialogue addresses were dually covered (and then some) in the original. Neil also does a good job of totting around his quick-tongued, dim-witted posse of fools, including William H. Macy and Tea Leoni, who play the divorced parents of a boy caught alone on the island after a parasailing accident leaves him stranded. Psssst: there's your plot.The fact of the matter is, Johnston knew he had no outs. With no capacity for further originality or expansion, Jurassic Park 3 could only solidly capitalize off of one thing. Give the people what they want, feed them their own tails when there is no tale to tell. And action is what you'll get. The fast paced, digitally perfected sequences rarely let up, growing in intensity and sheer aesthetic believability as the movie progresses. Jurassic hasn't gone CG like Star Wars. You won't find outlandish, graphically animated figures of The Mummy variety. These dinos look as real as they ever have, but show up throughout a lot more of this picture. With full-sized, animatronic models that weighed up to 5,000 lbs, moved limbs at speeds of 100 mph, and could pick up 5G's of force per movement, the dinos were more present than the actors in the majority of scenes. And this is only fitting.Perhaps Johnston would have made a bigger mistake had he actually tried to insert an innovative plot or theme or group of memorable characters into this feature. He cut a lot of the fatty sequel excess - protracted melodrama, bunk character bonding, and distended revelations - for a much more streamlined, action-stocked vehicle. Although the film's overall visual rendering is more drab and much darker than the former two, the (at times) humorous one-liners and on-going comedic bits (for instance, a ringing cell-phone in a Spinosaurus' belly) contrast well with the heavy effects, and give the movie the feel of a genuine, old-school popcorn flick.
Does this make scriptless direction, storyless action, and the abandonment of all formerly pertinent themes and social issues an acceptable solution? Jurassic Park 3 may have bite, but unlike the original, it gives you nothing to chew on.",Jurassic Park III
140,DavidSim240183,Not Dino-mite! But better than Part 2,8,1 January 2007,"For Jurassic Park 3, Steven Spielberg steps back, and assumes the mantle of Executive Producer. In the directors chair this time is Joe Johnston. Based on Johnston's CV, he was eminently qualified for the job. In fact I can't imagine a man more suited to the world of Jurassic Park than Joe Johnston. He tends to specialise in films that are action-packed thrill rides that intriguingly feature a jungle. Films like the superb Honey I Shrunk the Kids and the engaging Jumanji.And I'm pleased to say Johnston did a fine job with JP3. It's a better sequel than The Lost World. Granted its got an extremely sketchy plot, and takes place on Site B again, a place I despised in the last outing. But at least the action scenes are done with Johnston's consummate skill. And even at a slim 90 minutes, I had a much more fun time than I did with Part 2.JP3 heralds the welcome return of Sam Neill as Dr Alan Grant. And the early scenes with Grant's character are surprisingly poignant. Eight years ago, Grant was on top of the world. He was one of the world's foremost paleontologists, he was in a blossoming relationship with his beautiful girlfriend Dr Ellie Sattler (Laura Dern who makes a brief cameo here) and his work was acknowledged and respected.But time has not been kind to Dr Grant. Alan and Ellie are no longer together. They're still friends but she's happily married with children. Funds for Grant's research have dried up over the years, and many people have lost interest in his work. I felt real sadness for Grant here. Which made me realise how integral his character is to the success of the Jurassic Park series.Grant has been studying the intelligence of Velociraptors, and gets a chance to study them up close and personal when a couple, Paul and Amanda Kirby (William H Macy & Tea Leoni) want Grant to be their guide on Site B. Their son Eric was lost there during a paragliding accident, and with the authorities unwilling to help, Grant is their only hope.But no sooner have they arrived on Site B, our intrepid heroes face dangers and dinosaurs at every turn. JP3 may have the thinnest plot of the trilogy, but I enjoyed this film far more than the last one. The problem with TLW was although Spielberg staged some very exciting moments, there was nothing else to the film beyond that. They were just a loosely connected set of action scenes, with each one trying to outdo the other. But Joe Johnston has managed to incorporate some fascinating new dimensions.First off, the stars of the previous JP films were the T-Rex and the Velociraptors. In JP3, the T-Rex takes a back seat...to something much worse. If such a thing is possible.The badass dino this time around is actually a new kid on the block. The Spinosaurus. I've never actually heard of one, but apparently they did exist, and if JP3 is to be believed, its a much worse killing machine than the T-Rex. Makes you wonder why its so exalted.The Spinosaurus is one lean, mean eating machine. A huge snout. Razor sharp jaws. A deadly looking spine on its back. And its bigger than a T-Rex. It gets some marvellous moments too. Like the heartstopping sequence when it attacks their plane. And the wonderfully choreographed battle between the Spinosaurus and the T-Rex. It's a thrilling fight. And looks like something right out of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's Lost World.That's the great thing about JP3. The variations on tried and true methods. Spielberg didn't try anything different in Part 2, which is why the film suffered. But Joe Johnston has crammed tons of new ideas into this instalment. We get to see flying dinosaurs for the first time. And the swooping, soaring Pteranodons are a sight to see. They're not only a majestic view, but quite frightening too.And the Velociraptors, the scariest dinos in Part 1 have been given something else to do too. We've always known how intelligent they are. But here, they've developed to the point where they've acquired speech. Fortunately the film doesn't try anything cheesy as translating their grunts, but this added level of intelligence heightens their scare quotient.Johnston doesn't leave the actors out though. Neill is as impressive as ever, and its nice to see he's evolved over the years. He seems more comfortable around children now, and his scenes with Eric are great. As for the actor who plays Eric, Johnston does a great job fleshing out his character, making him a resourceful boy capable of fending for himself. He survives two months on his own on the island without any help. That's one thing I like about Joe Johnston's films. The children in his films can be capable, young adults without seeming precocious or obnoxious. I love Eric's comments on Jeff Goldblum's character: ""Too much chaos. Everything's chaos with this guy.""William H Macy is OK, but only puts in an adequate turn. Almost like he's doing a poor man's performance of Jerry Lundegaard from Fargo. Tea Leoni is relegated to the position of annoying screamer. But Allesandro Nivola's pretty good as Grant's protégé, who makes one questionable decision that plunges our heroes into a series of dire consequences.JP3 is a bit episodic. It's basically a series of disasters our heroes must overcome to survive. And the ending is surprisingly abrupt, not to mention disappointing with help handed to them on a silver platter. But I enjoyed it a hell of a lot more than Part 2. The final image of pteranodons flying off into the horizon clearly signifies developments for a further saga. Not sure what else they can do with the franchise, but with Joe Johnston back at the helm, it should be nothing less than bloody entertaining!",Jurassic Park III

This completely sums up Joe Johnston's movie which seems to take all the good work Spielberg did with the first movie and throw it straight down the can.JP3 is an absolute mess.
A movie that looks like it had more problems than a recently divorced person who'd just discovered that they'd lost their job and that their house had just burned down.
Why? Why is it so bad?
Well any magic that the first film had is completely smoked out of this one.
CGI has gone back twenty years. Surely a film made eight years after the original should look much better? Nope not this one.
The opening paragliding scene is laughably bad.
Talk about green screen?
I don't think they even used one of them!
Characters have no continuity and they make stupid decisions.
Dr Alan Grant actually volunteers to go back to the island with dinosaurs on it.
Ok he only agrees to fly over it but still?
After what he went through in the first movie if that was me you wouldn't get me anywhere near the place!
The character Billy is a tool!
Who in their right mind would steal eggs from one of the smartest most lethal predators to ever exist?
The whole premise of the movie is ludicrous.
A young boy with absolutely no Survival experience is trapped on the island of dinos all by himself.
Come on! The Mosquitoes, spiders, snakes and poisonous frogs would have probably killed him before old Rexy had chance to chomp on him.
Oh and what about when the Spinosaurous swallows the cell phone and it keeps ringing?
In 2001 you wouldn't be able to get a signal even if you crash landed into the phone mast!
Not to mention the only reason the characters in the movie noticed that the huge dino was standing behind them was because the bloody phone was ringing!
Really? What you couldn't hear a 23 ton dinosaur creep up on you?The silliness isn't the biggest offender in this movie.
It's the fact that the whole thing is uninspired.
A group of fanboys with a budget of fifteen dollars could have made a better movie. At least that movie would be made with love and affection.
Jurassic Park III is the movie that set the franchise back some fourteen years.
Both The Lost World and Fallen Kingdom were half a good movie. JP3 is all crap. Thankfully with a mere runtime of 1hr 32 mins.
But that's enough time to ruin a franchise.
Not until Jurassic World came along did Universal get their hot property back on track.
Well they did until they ruined it with the last half of Fallen Kingdom.",Jurassic Park III
145,johnnymacbest,The weakest of the first two films.,5,22 May 2008,"I LOVED the first Jurassic Park at the tender age of 10. It had everything you could want from a movie minus some underdeveloped character personalities but that film ROCKS even until this day and age. Part two was good though not as the original. The third installment: Terrible. Where was the adventure? Where was the excitement? Where was the suspense? Where was the danger? Drained of all the qualities of what made the first one so memorable. This could be blamed primarily on the director, Joe Johnston, who made that box-office bomb The Rocketeer nineteen years ago. What more can be said? At least the special effects were good; the fight between the T-Rex and Spinosaurus and the scene with the Pterodactyls but the plot was basically nonexistent and the acting was wooden and lifeless with no sense of conveying believability. And what's with the ""theory on raptor intelligence"" part? Were they assuming that raptors were smarter than birds and primates? One needs only to read various books on dinosaurs to find out. Seriously I don't expect movies to educate audiences but a little research wouldn't have hurt. I first saw this on opening day expecting more action, adventure, suspense, danger, and terror. Yet I got a lot less bang for the buck. A fine example on what happens when you switch directors mid franchise.Not even up to par with the original. Pure piece of crap. If they got the gall to make a fourth installment, better get Spielberg back on board or else this franchise will become ""extinct"" like the dinos.",Jurassic Park III

I also missed the original cast. I don't know why studios agreed to make a 3rd movie when it didn't have a proper story instead, it was just a rescue mission for a boy who went alone paragliding. Seriously?Overall, this is a bad movie and weakest in the franchise, which I think should not have been made as it effected the classiness of the franchise.",Jurassic Park III
147,theshadow908,Totally worthless sequel.,3,9 June 2006,"Jurassic Park III takes place 4 years after The Lost World. Dr. Alan Grant is still working on the fields. When a young boy goes missing over Site B, his parents track down Grant and tell him they want a fly over tour of the island. He reluctantly agrees for a large sum of money, but when they get there and land, he finds out that they're not rich at all, and they want him to lead them as they look for their son. Unfortunately, they don't know that there were two islands, and this is the one Alan Grant has never been to before. Jurassic Park III marks Steven Spielberg's departure from the series, and also the series' fall from grace. The acting, plot, and special effects are the worst here, and it makes you long for the crew of the first film.Steven Spielberg and Michael Crighton wanted to stick to dinosaur fact when they made the first two films, and they did a good job of that. In this movie, they try to make it look like the Velociraptors have evolved and they look more like birds now, complete with feathers sticking out of their head. They even hold intelligent conversation with each other, which makes the movie even more ridiculous. The main dinosaur of the movie switches from the T-Rex (which has only a small cameo in the film), and is now a Spinosaurus. This is another dinosaur ruined by the movie. The real Spinosaurus was 18-20 feet tall and far less vicious than the T-Rex. In this movie, it is closer to 50 feet and relentlessly stalks the people on the island. The Pterodactyl scene is so unbelievable that it makes me laugh. The whole plot of this movie is unbelievable and makes no sense. The style is different, and the dialogue is corny. This movie is a far cry from the first two films.The acting in this movie is astonishingly bad. Sam Neill was great as Alan Grant in the first film, but now he's just wooden with no emotion. William H. Macy and Tea Leoni are terrible as the parents of a missing boy. They don't show any real determination in finding him. All they do is walk around and call his name. The other actors in the film aren't even worth mentioning.The first two films were really awesome, and this movie just ruins it all by trying to be so much better that it ends up worse.

But unlike the second one, I actually consider Jurassic Park III a descent movie. Flawed yes, but it isn't really bad.The main problem is that it's just completely pointless. This was the only Jurassic Park Novel not based on a book, so was there any point in adabting it. It's also a little too kid friendly, almost like it was dumbed down a bit for a wider audience even though it's PG-13. Some of the CGI didn't age well at all, and Joe Johnson's direction isn't nearly as good as Steven Spielbergs. Pretty much every other problem is nitpicking.Now the fact that this isn't based on a book actually makes this better than The Lost World. That film didn't have anything to do with the book it was based on except for the basic plot of going to another island of dinosaurs. This film actually has a few elements from the second book that weren't in the last movie. The action scenes are pretty entertaining. I like the characters. Sam Niell is a better lead than Malcolm.

Why this island hasn't been bombed to smithereens when flying dinosaurs could wreck havoc on nearby civilization is absurd enough - but this is more like a monster island from a 1950's schlock movie where creatures attack from around any corner and sky. The threadbare plot involves an irritating divorced couple played by a very annoying Téa Leoni and William H Macy looking for their son who is lost on the island. They convinced Sam Neill's character to help, yet end up basically kidnapping the man, because he's the last thread connecting this stinker to the first Jurassic film - not that he's really the best man for the job.

159,mnpollio,"Derivative sequel, but better than The Lost World",6,10 June 2011,"There are a lot of directions for sequels of the mega-blockbuster Jurassic Park to go, so it becomes increasingly frustrating that its sequels do not take any of them and insist on rehashing the same tired storyline. That is not to say that there are not elements to enjoy in this third entry in the JP franchise. In fact, this entry is infinitely more painless than the Spielberg-directed atrocity The Lost World.Having realized that Jeff Goldblum's Ian Malcolm served better as a supporting character than a lead, this entry thankfully brings back the reliable Sam Neill as paleontologist Dr. Alan Grant. Grant is more than happy to have left the denizens of Jurassic Park behind and to return to the excavation of fossils. Unfortunately, he is plagued by funding woes and curiosity seekers. Fate seems to smile on him and his student assistant Alessandro Nivola in the guise of a wealthy married couple, William H. Macy and Tea Leoni, who claim to have gotten permission to fly over the island and want him to act as a tour guide for an exorbitant fee.Naturally Neill can hardly decline, and naturally the couple have misrepresented themselves. To cut to the chase, the ragtag group end up trapped on the island simultaneously looking for escape as well as any sign of Macy and Leoni's young son, Trevor Morgan, who was previously stranded there.Among the improvements from the last sequel are the return of Neill to the lead. It never did make any sense why a chaos theoretician with no knowledge of dinosaurs would lead an exploration a la The Lost World. It is also nice to see Laura Dern back albeit in a glorified cameo appearance. The visual effects continue to amaze and we get the introduction of some fascinating new creatures (the spinosaur and the pterodactyls). The film also develops the rapters in a rather intriguing direction, although it never completely fleshes it out. There is also a truly breathtaking moment aboard a boat on a river with a brachiosaur leaning forward. The film is refreshingly short and sweet, literally flying past.On the down side, the brevity does not allow much time for development. Director Joe Johnston moves things along at a healthy clip, but the tone he sets for the film is oddly light and sorely misses the tension that Spielberg brought to the original (although even Spielberg failed to bring that to the next installment). Additionally, while Johnston has a workmanlike grasp of action sequences, none of the subsequent set pieces seem as exciting as the initial plane crash and attack by the spinosaur. Another problem is that there are so few people on this adventure that it becomes fairly obvious early on who is not going to make it, and said characters are eliminated ridiculously early into the adventure.Another thing is that the new characters as a rule fail to bring much to the film. Macy and Leoni alternate between mild amusement and annoyance as the estranged couple searching for their son. I have yet to figure out why the series feels compelled to shoehorn a kid on each on these jaunts - it fit fine in the original, while not at all in its sequel. That said, Morgan is at least competent and not the embarrassment of Vanessa Lee Chester in the prior film. The late Michael Jeter seems almost laughably miscast as the mercenary leader. Nivola is the exception to the rule here. His character ostensibly has a reason to be included in the action and has as close to a character arc as the film allows. He is sexy, believable and always seems on the verge of breaking out into something stronger, but the film never truly allows it. On a side note, I have a sneaking suspicion that the fate of his character was altered to accommodate how well he connects in the role compared to some of his co-stars.In the end, this is an enjoyable, visually entertaining romp that is a marked improvement over the prior entry, but lacks the punch of the original. Hopefully, there is another sequel looming somewhere in the future that will allow the action to step completely away from the isolation of the islands and which does not feature Vince Vaughn.",Jurassic Park III

It turns out they have more on their minds than just a sightseeing trip; much to Grant's chagrin. Of course, the members of the team consisting of Grant, the Kirbys, a few mercenaries and a young paleontologist named Billy Brennan (Alessandro Nivola) get stuck on the island and have to fight for their lives to make it to the coast and call for help.At first it looks like Jurassic Park III could be a pretty decent movie: Dr. Ellie Sattler (Laura Dern) from the first movie is featured in a small role and there are no annoying kids squeaking all the time (at first, that is...). Unfortunately the movie soon becomes pretty much what I feared it would be: running and screaming in the dark with no sense of amazement or adventure. The story doesn't waste much time for character development or pondering the justification of gene technology and just jumps straight into action. Well, action can be very entertainment when done right, but here it is nothing that wasn't already done better in the first films of the series – the sense of adventure is missing. The dinosaur effects aren't as amazing as in the first Jurassic Park (or at least they don't feel like that anymore), although the addition of Pteranodons and communicating Velociraptors is a cool idea even if the scenes aren't ultimately as exciting as they sound like. Maybe the most effective moment in the film is the sudden appearance of a Spinosaurus after a cell phone ringtone is heard faintly in its direction – more such moments of astonishment would have been needed to make the film a good adventure.While there are enjoyable things to be found in Jurassic Park III, such as the majestic score music (even though the best musical themes are recycled from the first movie) and the charisma of Sam Neill in the lead role, they just aren't enough to make the movie a truly worthy sequel to the first JP. The Lost World wasn't great either but at least it had the fun finale on the streets of San Diego, and whereas JP3 lacks such a climax, it may entertain action-adventure fans who accept the fact that it can't be as good as the original. Watch it if you liked The Lost World; otherwise, don't get your hopes up.",Jurassic Park III
161,flicklover,"C'mon guys,you know it's FUN!!!",7,23 July 2001,"I enjoyed this movie more than I thought I would. Obviously, it is not better than the first installment, JP1 had a sense of awe and discovery going for it. But this new installment is DEFINITELY better than ""The Lost World"". The second installment was big,loud and boring, Steven Spielberg was on automatic pilot when he helmed that one. JP3 feels more like a monster movie than the others, a well made big budget B movie, on that level it succeeds admirably. I had read some reviews of this film before seeing it, my expectations were lowered by them. After seeing it I feel that some of the criticisms are ridiculous. One of them is that the movie is too short at 92 minutes. These days people seem to be equating length with quality, not so, the length for this movie is just fine, it is an action film, not an overblown epic. It is nice to see Sam Niell back as Dr. Grant, Laura Dern has a nice cameo as Dr. Satler. But in this series the stars are the dinosaurs! They are as fierce as ever, but again the awe element from the first one isnt here, the audience had seen most of the creatures before. The film is exciting and entertaing, to quibble about character development in this kind of movie is useless. Compared to ""Godzilla"" of a couple of years ago, JP3's script seems like ""Gone With The Wind""!!!! So just go sit back and have a good time!Grade: B",Jurassic Park III
162,rollernerd,Watch out for the birdcage,6,13 January 2021,"Welcome to another edition of Adam's Reviews!! **queue in intro music**Tonight's movie review is Jurassic Park III (2001), where we have Joe Johnston taking over directing duties with the dinosaur franchise. This time we have Dr Alan Grant played by Sam Neil, back into the picture as he helps a supposedly wealthy dude and his wife on an aerial tour of Isla Sorna, or as people may have known in the previous flick, Site B. Soon Dr. Grant discovers that his hosts are not what they seem and finds himself on a rescue mission packed full of prehistoric animals who are more cunning than the first 2 movies.This third flick is okay and has its moments including the scene of the suvivors walking into the Pterodactyl cage - that was cool as, especially around jumping over cliffs to avoid getting eating by baby birds and another character parachuting to help out - real badass. What lets this film down is how the filmmakers not developing the characters. The cast are great but are not given much to work with which is disappointing as all of the characters do have potential however in this film are nowhere as interesting as the previous films. Neil's return is great and does awesome work in each of his scenes given what little he had. But to me his character arc is ruined... after learning to love kids in the original movie you would expect he would go on and marry Ellie. But nooooo...Ellie is married to some government dude and has a kid with him. It was nonsense to undo all that development from the first flick.Now other than the Kirby couple been annoying as - the worst part to me was the lazy crap ending - rushed and anti-climactic!! It's as if the filmmakers were just over and done with the story. Such a waste. The second worst part was the Spinosaurus and T-Rex fight, its neat but breaking the neck of T-Rex is a no go! Another negativity of this film is how the dinosaurs did not look appealing - wayyyy too much CGI and not enough animatronics. The movie isn't bad nor did the director do a crap job - this movie just lacked creativity and was way too dependent on the CGI, overall, 6/10.",Jurassic Park III

164,ExpendableMan,The franchise enters B-movie territory,5,24 April 2006,"Remember when you first saw Jurassic Park? Remember that pulse-pounding opener that offered only the most minimal tease as to the carnage that would follow? Remember the long slow build up to the eventual unveiling of the Dinosaurs and sharing Dr Alan Grant's wonder at the first sighting? And the same adrenaline pumping thrill when the Rex first broke loose? Well I'm sorry to tell you that the same rapture is absent from the third instalment in the franchise, but on a second look this isn't so much of a hindrance as you might realise.The film makers this time around realise that offering us only the barest glimpses of Dinosaurs will not have the same effect anymore. We've already marvelled at the herds of Brachiosaurs marching before the sunset so now, we can get stuck right into the thick of the action without hesitation. As a consequence Jurassic Park 3 is considerably more light-hearted than it's predecessors (Sam Neil in particular seems to be having a blast playing Indiana Jones's reptile bothering cousin again) and if you approach it as such, it's a very enjoyable movie.There's no theme park backing or evil corporate agenda behind the plot as Dr Alan Grant is hired by the rather odd married couple the Kirbys (Tea Leoni and the ever watchable William H Macy) as a guide for a special Dinosaur spotting flight over Isla Sorna. And before you can say ""no secret hidden agenda here no sir"" the cast are once again running through jungle, screeching in fear for their lives as monstrous prehistoric beasts pursue them through the undergrowth. And here is where we're treated to the real stars of the show, the Dinosaurs themselves.T-Rex however plays a much smaller role passing the torch to the new king of the thunder lizards, the monstrous Spinosaurus. This may have rankled with some fans but the new addition to the menagerie makes for a remarkable creature: a 60 foot predator with a snout filled with teeth and the kind of temper that'd put a pro tennis player to shame. The early clash between this new apex creature and the former tyrant lizard is one gob-smacking (but painfully brief) highlight and not even the rather silly Peter Pan-style gag involving it swallowing a mobile phone can ruin it.That aside, there are also plenty of fast-paced set pieces to keep the pace at a constant high. The raptors return once again and there's also another fresh menace in the shape of the Pteranodons; colossal winged reptiles that weren't actually dinosaurs but a whole other species entirely. The scene where the cast gets stuck in their massive aviary is a riot and if you've ever found yourself being pecked at by seagulls on Brighton pier, just imagine it but a thousand times worse and you'll get the idea.Not the gob-smacking brilliance of the original by a long shot but with the refreshingly daft approach, it's certainly better than The Lost World (which was to all extents and purposes a remake of Aliens but with Dinosaurs instead of extra-terrestrials). It does suffer from the lack of Jeff Goldblum and the non-climax is a big let down but as popcorn munchers go, there are far worse ways to spend an evening.",Jurassic Park III

Remember witnessing the baby raptor hatching out of the egg? Remember watching the T-Rex thunder across the screen? Or the adult raptors stalking the kids in the kitchen? *SIGH* JURASSIC PARK. What started as a brilliant masterpiece has been turned into a downward-spiraling series. Much like Spielberg's similarly great shark film JAWS! By the time LOST WORLD came out, the dinosaurs became nothing more than standard-issue movie monsters that just stomped around and ate everybody who wasn't famous. By the time JURASSIC PARK III came about, the formula was already getting old and worn. Here's the story: An annoying kid goes paragliding and crash-lands onto the island of dinosaurs. The boy's annoying parents (played by William H. Macy and Tea Leoni) convince Alan Grant (Sam Neill, yay!) to accompany them to the island in a rescue attempt. Apart from some new dinosaurs (including the flying pterodactyls, finally) there's not much else to write home about with this one.

169,SMLA11,Good movie,9,26 May 2002,Jurassic Park 3 is a pretty interesting movie.  I mean same thing as other Jurassic Park movies.  Monster dinosaurs break loose and attack people horribly.  The acting is really good in this one.  A lot of big name stars and there characters are very good.  Tea Leoni and William H. Macy are perfect as the divorced parents who are looking for there son Trevor Morgan who is lost on the island for eight weeks.  He hardly gets a scratch on him for eight weeks but the other characters are badly cut up just in a few hours.  The other cast members are excellent and fill there parts well.Overall the entire movie was an edge of your seat thriller from beginning to end.  Rating 10 out of 10.,Jurassic Park III

171,basrutten,At least it didn't have Jeff Goldblum....,3,16 January 2002,"A lot of people have told me that a good story is not important in movies like this one, since they are obviously meant to entertain through constant action and humour. To a certain extent, I agree with them. However, there are two ""buts"": 1) if the action reallyisn't any good, then the story becomes important 2) some movies have such a ridiculously poor story, that it doesn't matter how good the action is.Unfortunately, JP 3 suffers from both phenomena. The action in this movie is identical to that in the first two JP movies: again we have chases by big nasty dinosaurs, and scenes in which the humans have to outsmart the oh-so-smart raptors. Nothing new here except for a short appearance by some (goofy-looking) flying dinosaurs.Then there's the total lack of story, internal logic or character interaction: after 15 minutes, all the main characters are already stranded on the island, and two ""extras"" have already been eaten. Not to mention the incredibly silly way in which Sam Neill ends up on the island again, even after he had vowed not to go to any dino-island again. After that, we are made to believe that an 8-year old kid can survive by himself on a dino-infested island for 8 weeks, that a character who is clearly heavily wounded by pterodactyls actually survives, that a cell phone can survive a trip through the intestines of a 20 foot dinosaur, and that Sam Neill is suddenly fluent at ""raptor language"".Redeeming qualities: some funny jokes, absence of Jeff Goldblum Bad points: repetitive action, poor story, huge lapses in logicRating: 1/2 out of ****",Jurassic Park III
172,jerekra,Not Enough Dinosaurs in this Short Film.,6,8 February 2009,"Jurassic Park 3 is the third in the Jurassic Park series and also the shortest at only about an hour and a half long.Grant is convinced by a married couple to be a tour guide for them on a trip to Isla Sorna. Soon it turns out that they really brought him along for a rescue mission to find their son. From there they must watch out for Velociraptors, Pteranadons, and the largest predatory dinosaur Spinosaurus.I liked and disliked the new dinosaurs that are in this movie.Spinosaurus was pretty cool. He gets to take down Tyrannosaurus and kills some people but Spinosaurus really is not in this film as much as he should be. I thought he was going to be the main antagonist throughout the film. Instead he attacks the group as they land and later appears briefly and breaks a cage and then does not show up again till the end.Pteranadons get a larger role in this film than in ""The Lost World."" Really I did not find the Pteranadons that cool or interesting and if you want to be technical they are not even a true dinosaur.The Velociraptors are also not in this film that much. One of the main complaints I have for this film is that it is too short and really should have been longer to include some more dinosaur parts.The story is bad in this film. How could Grant be tricked so easily by the Kirby family and not realize they were tricking him. Grant is supposed to be smart. Also they do a poor job explaining where the Spinosaurus came from.It is good to see Grant back but he is about the only interesting human character in this film. I really hated Mrs. Kirby played by Tea Leoni. SHe is just so boring and emotionless throughout the film. Also William H. Macy as Mr. Kirby seemed to be lacking intrigue as well and he really played the guy not used to being in the woods awfully.I must complain with how the Spinosaurus vs Tyrannosaurus fight went as well as give some insight. This should have taken place at the end of the film rather than at the beginning. I think they wanted to show how Spinosaurus is superior but the battle between those two dinosaurs was easily the best part of the film but it happened too soon and after nothing compared with it the rest of the way. Jack Horner was involved with this film and he has always criticized Tyrannosaurus and I think he just wanted to make Tyrannosaurus look bad in this film.The music is just as good as it was in the other two.I liked the Spinosaurs and Grant. However it should have been longer, had some bad acting, and some parts of the story were lame. Easily the worst of the series but worth watching a few times.",Jurassic Park III
173,swedzin,One gigantic slap in the face with dino turd to the original Jurassic Park fans all over the world.,3,25 May 2016,"I wasn't that excited for this film, after founding out that T Rex is not a star anymore. But, I watched it, just to see what a hell they did with it. I did not have any high expectations and after the film, it turns out to be a large disappointment. In my opinion, Jurassic Park (1993) is one of the best movies I have ever saw. The beautiful, stylish SF/adventure with great directing, cast and CGI. The sequel Lost World: Jurassic Park (1997) was not bad, but it did posses the beauty of the first one. But the third film is just a low, yet evil move. A really big slap in the face to the fans and audience. Usually, I don't find most of sequels, prequels, or remakes necessary, but for this one I decide to make an exception, but after finding out about some things, noted above on the beginning of the review. The film is directed by Joe Johnston who single handedly destroyed Jurassic Park trilogy. This guy is a bad director, just bad. It took 3 people to write a screenplay for this film no wonder they ruined the whole stuff too.We bring back Dr. Alan Grant and dr. Ellie Settler (although her character has only 2-3 minutes of screen time in total and she wasn't that interesting). Grant and his assistant Billy are tricked by fake rich man Kirby (played by William H. Macy) and his wife Amanda (Tea Leoni) to take them to the island Isla Nublar to act like a dinosaur guides. But, it turns out that Kirby and Amanda are looking for their son Eric. So they have to endure a rough jungle terrain filled with all kind of dinosaurs. The story is just ridiculous. Are you kidding me? People are so desperate to kidnap other people because they believe that they know about the island where their son is located? The premise just doesn't make sense. And you expect for the kid to survive on an island full of dinosaurs? Come on The actors (even the talented ones) were just ridiculous in their performances. The characters are predictable and dumb. Really dumb, unreasonable characters That slap in the face to the audience and fans that is a large spoiler. Watch the movie if you want to know what I'm talking about. The music score is not bad, composed by Don Davis, who just took from John Williams and change it a little bit. Sound effects were good, CGI could be better and I can appreciate the usage of practical effects and audio-animatronic effects. Other things just suck. There's also a subplot which is based upon new scientific findings (from that time) and they decided to put it in the film, OK some of that stuff is interesting, and some of that is just ridiculous. Some of the new changes is that velociraptors had a crest on their head and that the Spinosaur was the biggest carnivore who ever walked the earth. Overall, this is one huge dino turd and it deserves to be forgotten.",Jurassic Park III
174,carlos37andre,"Yep, now I understand what went wrong in the series",3,24 May 2020,"So, that's where It begins, the fall of the Jurassic Park franchise! Lol, just kidding, I'm re-watching the JP movies after not seen them in a while (since I was 5 or 6 years old, actually). And well, I thought JP1 is still really good, I had some issues with JP2, but overall, I thought it was fun, but man... besides seen Alan again, this movie has almost nothing else to offer.Oh yeah, and even Alan tho, they bring him and Ellie back, but they split them! I mean, c'mon! Why did you have to do that? She has KIDS! Wtf!Ok, focusing now. The movie is just... bad, we barely have dinosaurs in it, JP2 had a worst story than JP1, but it at least made up for it by having a whole lot of dinosaurs in it, this one is probably the one we see the least dinosaurs, and even though it is almost 10 years older than JP1, it has by far the worst animatronics, and worst CGI. Idk if it was the budget or something (I mean, it has like 90 minutes, with credits!). It truly just feels like an excuse to do another movie, and make some money out of it.The movie has no villain, besides Alan you don't care at all about any of the characters, and that, is mostly cause we know Alan from the first movie.Anyways, another thing, what's the deal with those ""new"" dinosaurs? Like, where did they come from...? There is even a red T-Rex with a horn...? What?The only good thing I can say about the film is that... the pterodactyls are... fine? Everything else is pretty much forgettable. It shows the impact of not having a guy like Steven Spielberg behind everything.At the end, JP3 is just a forgettable film, with new character you do not care about, almost nothing entertaining, 30 seconds of dinos fighting, every single one of the main characters survive (that's not necessarily bad, but you have already little action, and when you do, no one is really affected by) and a plot line about the raptors... talking? Anyways, is a bad film.Obs: I almost forgot, but man, what the hell was that nightmare scene with the raptor? Why? How? What?",Jurassic Park III
175,fung0,Easily Best of the Three,8,22 June 2015,"This is far and away my favourite of the original Jurassic trilogy. I'm not sure I can say exactly why, but given the low average rating, I'd like to try.1. No Spielberg. The original JP is one of Spielberg's most indulgent messes. It suffers especially from what I call 'The Spielberg Gape,' a mechanism he abuses in many of his films: having characters endlessly staring into space, in supposed Awe and Wonder. None of that in JP3.2. Likable characters. William H Macy is absolutely perfect dinosaur fodder. Only a few moments of Laura Dern's drippiness. And none at all of that idiotic 'chaotician' guy.3. Humor. Macy's line about the ""tricyclaplotz"" makes me laugh every time.4. Parachutes!5. Pure action, no detours for plot - or typical Spielbergian set-pieces.6. More dinosaurs. CG got cheaper, and we got more raptors.More than anything, though, I think it's the lack of pretensions. Unlike it's predecessors, JP3 is a B movie that knows its a B movie. There's a sense of fun that Spielberg's heavy-handed touch eliminates from the first two instalments. Not that they're bad movies, or anywhere near Spielberg's worst. But JP3 is just more entertaining.I recall a few reviewers saying all this at the time JP3 was released. I guess very few people listened. Anyway, if I had to watch one of the three Jurassic films 1,000 times, I'd pick JP3.",Jurassic Park III
176,Sonatine97,"Jurassic Park is now no more than an old fossil,",4,17 July 2001,"This film stinks of cheap Hollywood exploitation. It is a truly dreadful movie with a limp script, bored actors, hackneyed pacing and lack of any true content, surprise or interest. And this is what is so wrong with Hollywood these days. Rather than take a chance with something new & exciting, they stick to formula and squeeze a few more quid out of the movie-public.I can only imagine Sam Neil, Macey & Leone were really hardup for cash when they took on this load of rubbish, because it certainly hasn't done much for their acting abilities or street cred.There is nothing to commend in this movie, in fact it looks positively dated right from the outset. Movies like Shrek, Final Fantasy & Lord Of The Rings, are what people are (or will be) gunning for, as storylines & 4th generation cgi become more intelligent & subtle.JP3 lacks all these qualities and is now becoming an embarrassment. I get the impression its going to go the Jaws route, with a franchise of JP sequels  such as JP-3D, JP - This Time Its Personal, JP Bites Back!!!They should've killed the golden goose after JP1 and let the fans remember the original in a more redeeming light, rather than having it hauled down & smeared with its bastard off-spring.This film is pants!!*/*****",Jurassic Park III

Macy, Téa Leoni, Alessandro Nivola, Trevor Morgan, Michael Jeter, John Diehl, Bruce A. Young, Laura Dern, Taylor Nichols, Mark Harelik, Julio Oscar Mechoso, and Sarah Danielle Madison Directed By: Joe Johnston Review This time, it's not just a walk in the park! You know a lot of Jurassic Park fans hate this entire in the series for many reasons and most I do understand but here's the thing, the second film is much worse and I actually like this one. In need of funds for research, Dr. Alan Grant accepts a large sum of money to accompany Paul and Amanda Kirby on an aerial tour of the infamous Isla Sorna. It isn't long before all hell breaks loose and the stranded wayfarers must fight for survival as a host of new -- and even more deadly -- dinosaurs try to make snacks of them. The movie was trying to be a serviceable fun sequel that was more traditional the book titled The Lost World unlike the last film. It had the raptors being able to communicate with each other, the parachute scene so as to why people say this worst then the second is very insulting. The story is not Oscar worth, its not complex one either it's just a fun rescue mission. That's good it's plain and simple and makes for a fun film. The performances now, that's the bad part I mean most of the cast do fine I just didn't like the guy who played Billy( the guy in the parachute in the end I think that's what his name was) and the mother, she was really annoying. Joe Johnston has actually given me four movies I fairly enjoy and one that I love(Captain America: The First Avenger) the other films Honey I shrunk The Kids, Jumanji, and I do really like The Wolfman remake with Anthony Hopkins I think it's a very good and fun remake. He does a good job here as well. Considering how much people hate this film I guess I'll say I hate myself for liking this movie and so I'm giving Jurassic Park III a three out of five.",Jurassic Park III
178,robsta23,"Bad, But Not as Terrible as I Thought It Would Be",4,11 June 2015,"The aspect of Jurassic Park III that I liked is the fact that Dr. Alan Grant is restored as the protagonist in this installment, making for a more intriguing focus than when Goldblum was the protagonist of The Lost World. While there are a good amount of elements I disliked in this film, I thought I was going to enjoy it even less than I did. I set my expectations super low for a film I vaguely remember seeing around the time it was released, which means I haven't seen the film in roughly 14 years.Just like in The Lost World, I can't believe how idiotic some of the characters were in this film. In The Lost World it was the old man who was extremely dumb sending people into danger again after being responsible for the tragedy at Jurassic Park, and now Kirby is the idiot for tricking Dr. Grant and his sidekick Billy into helping him rescue his son on the second island on which InGen was creating dinosaurs. It is brave of him as a father, but all the arrangements he made were stupid - Dr. Grant is a dinosaur expert, not the head of a rescue squad, the ""mercenaries"" Kirby hired weren't really mercenaries, and of course everybody except Grant, Kirby and his family, and Billy, are killed.What doesn't make too much sense is that Kirby couldn't convince the U.S. embassy to help rescue his son, yet Ellie (Laura Dern) is able to convince the navy and marines to rescue Grant and everyone still alive on the island after one phone call from Grant.This movie reminds me of a shorter version of Saving Private Ryan in a way, but these people are risking their lives for one boy, not one soldier, which creates a different emotional connection than Saving Private Ryan.The quality of the film just doesn't seem to match up to the original 2 - the CGI is overused in this one and looks worse than the CGI of the first 2, and the robotic dinosaurs are utilized less, which kind of breaks the illusion of the movie. The writing is bad (by the way, what was Alexander Payne doing co-writing this movie? that was a strange credit to see) with dialogue about ""driving 5 miles under the speed limit"" intending to be meaningful (I'm not joking, it's that bad) and we lack dialogue as well as the theme of the ethics of recreating dinosaurs overall except for one instance when Grant says ""this is playing God,"" referring to what InGen was doing.The movie held my interest at times, but it was a fairly bad 3rd installment for this movie franchise.

This is a movie that every blue haired granny would be happy for their grand children to watch.As you would expect 'no expense is spared', as with the previous movies the locations are very good, Sam Neill does a solid job given the weak story. The director (Joe Johnston) likes his little tricks, the early scene with Sam Neill in the garden being a good example. The effects are better then JP1 but time and technology moves on and the impact is lessened, we do finally get to see a big dino fight.A big gripe with JP3 is that the horror aspects have been so diluted.

It's short, to the point, knows when to end. Some people have felt cheated by the sudden ending, but I felt it was fine. Better svelte, without the fat than dragging on and on to another chase sequence or something like that. Jurassic Park III takes place as the second JP movie does, whatever it's name is, not the one where the actual park was on. It is overrun with dinosaurs, new ones and old ones from the Jurassic Park franchise, and they look fantastic. When we look back at the original Jurassic Park when it came out in 1993, we marveled at the wonderful special effect dinosaurs, so by 2001 when Joe Johnson's JP3 came out, the dinosaurs were ho-hum, which is a shame, because they look fantastic. The setup to the plot is interesting, a young child is stranded on the dinosaur-infested island and his divorced parents (William H. Macy and Tea Leone) want to get him back. They enlist Dr. Allen Grant (Sam Neil), the scientist who battled the dinosaurs in Jurassic Park, to help guide them through the island. There are a few great looking chase scenes, very little actual plot advancement, and some hidden chuckles. I was surprised with how funny some of the scenes were, especially the one involving dino-pee. The movie is nothing more than popcorn entertainment, but it's pretty good and worth a look. The movie loses steam at the end, but by then, the movie's over, and Jurassic Park IV cannot be too far away.",Jurassic Park III

183,MF210,The Worst of the Three,5,26 October 2003,"My Rating:** out of ****. Jurassic Park III was the biggest disappointment of the summer of 2001. The trailer looked great but the movie is not. It is easily the worst of the three films. This movie lacks the excitement that the first two had. It doesn't really start moving till the end. The scene which it starts is the Pteranodon scene, which was very exciting. However, thats about the only standout action scene. The others are very poorly done. Well actually the first scene of the movie with the fog is kind of creepy.  The Special Effects are still impressive but they are losing their freshness. They were eye popping in the first two movies but there just good here. There is actually one scene where the effects look sort of fake.
These movies have never been actor movies, the dinosaurs mostly overshadow the actors. But the acting was still a little better than ok. Here, Sam Neill is flat. Laura Dern has barely any screentime. Tea Leoni is very out of place. William H. Macy has one funny scene but other than that his performance isn't much. Whats really disappointing about this movie is that dinosaurs are less interesting here. We have an oversized Crocodile and Raptors with shi* coming out of their head. The Pteranodons are the only ones that shine. There actually more evil. Yeah and what the hell??? The T-Rex, he was the star of the first two films. Why the fuc* would you kill him off. Where the hell are the other two? They could kill the Oversized Crocodile.
Overall, JP3 was a disappointment. Its hard to say if there should even be another sequel. It may be time for this franchise to go extinct.",Jurassic Park III

185,patrick_dunne,"Far from excellent, but far from horrible",7,20 October 2005,"Jurassic Park was a very good movie. But, of course, like JAWS, it must have a sequel if it did well in the box office, in Speilburg standards. I'm not sure if this is good or bad, but this film isn't done by Speilburg. This may be a good thing, because his sequels were never done well. JAWS 2, for example was directed towards teens, which may of ruined the movie. Then again, Steven Speilburg is a great director, the best of them all- except Alfred Hitchcock.Jurassic Park III doesn't have as much story as the original. There is a lack of ""quiet moments"" for the story to build. The upside to this is that it makes the film easier to pay attention to, and you don't have to get bored to death by the boring beginning of the first one. The storyline is decent, but mostly replaced by stylish action.This film is a disappointment to the original, which was highly likely because it is a sequel, but it isn't too bad, in my opinion. It isn't a remarkable or excellent film, but it does have its high points.7/10Feel free to send me a Private Message regarding this comment.",Jurassic Park III
186,TuckMN,"Well, I liked the opening credits...",7,24 July 2001,"Even with a run-time of not quite an hour-and-a-half there are parts of this new film in the Speilberg/Crichton dinosaur franchise that drag.  Since a director can only crowd so many special effects into a film  and this is wholly a special effects film  the reason for the dullness is obvious.There is a story; but it is predictable and not as 'in-your-face scary' as the first two Jurassic Park films.  Maybe not so surprisingly, the scariest moments were when the audience was anticipating what might (or might not) happen instead of when it did (or did not) transpire.  The reason being is that we can create more terrifying images in our heads than all of the computer generated monsters that can be produced on the screen.Sam Neill reprises his role as Dr. Allen Grant and Laura Dern makes an all-too-brief appearance as her character of Dr. Ellie Sattler. 
Mr. Neill seems to be doing a pale imitation of an Indiana Jones type character  without the strengths and charm of Indiana  which seems like more of a script problem than an actor problem.Tea Leoni and William H. Macy are both very capable and able actors and they do what they can with the script they were presented with.  They deserve better material.The score was only thematically influenced by the master of film orchestration, John Williams  but it was not written by him so it lacks that special something that he is able to impart in all the music he writes.The location photography was up to the standards set by the previous two Jurassic Park films and made up in many ways for the other missing elements of this film.I think I was more surprised by who did not die, or was not eaten, or otherwise deposed than by who survived.Immediately after the film was over I turned to my film-going companion and said, `I smell a sequel.'  It is probably already in the works.",Jurassic Park III
187,mgruebel,Sequel of a sequel is a pile of dinosaur ...,4,25 December 2013,"Jurassic Park 1 was an eye-opener in CGI for its time. Its first sequel is nothing to write home about. The sequel of the sequel even less so.Somewhere in the middle of the movie, someone digs into a steaming pile of dinosaur poop, and that is pretty much how the moviegoer must feel watching this film. The characters to be rescued are for the most part so idiotic you hope they get eaten. Caprona had a better pterodactyl scene than JP III. In fact, if you haven't seen that Doug McClure vehicle from the 70s, rent it instead of JP III. Caprona is far more amusing, and its primitive special effects (yes - they decorated a glider plane to look like a pterodactyl and scoop up a Neanderthal in 1,000,000 BC fashion!) at least have a palpable physical reality.JP III is a muddled mess of robotic acting, implausible character motivations, boredom at yet more dinosaurs eating stupid people. Of course, THE STEVE was no longer at the reins here, but Joe Johnston has directed some pretty decent movies, like ""Honey, I Shrunk the Kids"" and ""Rocketeer,"" so what went wrong? The real blame goes to the script writers. Sam Neill and Johnston should have just 'said no' when they saw the steaming pile of you-know-what that is the script for this film. In fact, a simple piece of advice: any movie that credits 3 or more script writers, be as cautious as a movie directed by ""Alan Smithee"" before investing your time. Or you will lose two hours of your life, as I did.The film still has professional production values, and the actors attempt to act, so it gets 4 stars because I reserve 0-3 for even worse.",Jurassic Park III
188,BrickNash,A high quality ending to a great trilogy!,8,27 January 2014,"I am shocked to see how many people didn't enjoy this film but that's purists for you. Let's be clear, there are absolutely NO bad films in the Jurassic Park trilogy. I had it in my head at least one of them was terrible but I think it's just expectations vs. reality.JP3 is a great piece of popcorn adventure cinema. The plot by now is complete formula and lacks the absolute magic of the original film but then again so did The Lost World so it's hard to blame it for that. I actually think the film overall is better than the Lost World although TLW tops it on suspense moments. The film rips along with plenty of visual action and new dinosaurs as well as our old friends the raptors. Joe Johnstone is an experienced director at these sort of films and he delivers 100% on this movie plus it's great to see the return of Sam Neil and a brief appearance by Laura Dern too.I don't know what more to say. It'll never have the same impact as the first film but the pacing is great, it's entertaining and it kept my attention throughout and I think it's a fine conclusion to a great series.",Jurassic Park III
189,oshram-3,A worthier sequel than JP2,7,18 July 2001,"From the start, returning Alan Grant to the story makes the movie farbetter. Briefly mentioning the second film, JP3 is really more of asequel to the first film, and retains the spirit of that film a lot moreclosely. Not only is the story much tighter, but JP3 takes itself andits subjectmatter seriously, sparing us the embarrassment of the wholeSan Diego episode in the second film. Director Joe Johnston wrings somenice moments with mostly new dinosaurs; there's a sense that they wantedthis one to be different, and they succeeded.

191,caseynicholson,"A Nice Recovery from ""The Lost World""",6,23 July 2015,"I finally got around to watching ""Jurassic Park III"", the third installment of the franchise which I had never seen until this summer. I watched the first two a couple of months ago in preparation for ""Jurassic World"", but got side railed before getting to this movie.The upside of this third chapter in the franchise is that it is a huge improvement over ""The Lost World"", which I found to be hackneyed and grotesque, not to mention the final thirty minutes of that film being just very strange.JP3 on the other hand sticks to the formula that made the original a hit. The entire tale revolves around an ill-gotten trip to the island of the first film, where dinosaurs now roam free. The script has its good moments, and Sam Neil's reprisal of the lead role from the first film is a plus.That said, the problem with these movies is that once you've seen the first one, you've kind of seen them all. The basic plot is that there's a terrible problem where a group of people are being chased by dinosaurs. Some people get eaten. Some don't. Role the credits.And so, I've given this film 6/10 stars, midway in between my rating for its two predecessors. It's not a bad movie--it's just a bit overdone.",Jurassic Park III

193,twanurit,"Better than the second, as good as the first",9,14 August 2001,"Yes, that's right. This is a rousing, suspenseful dinosaur tale that moves quickly and whose shorter running time (92 minutes) works to its advantage. The first two were overlong (at 2 Hours) for this kind of picture. The second one was disappointing, cluttered with big-name hunters and a tacked-on, badly directed San Diego finale. The first was good, a little corny in spots, yet there are some dinosaur scenes (not enough of them) that are phony: the reclined animiatronic Triceratops, and the Brachisaurs in a night scene. ""Jurassic Park lll"" retains the best actors from the first, Sam Neill, seasoned, earnest and looking fine, as well as, in a smaller role, Laura Dern, whose character is refreshingly NOT married to Neill's. Shanghaied into returning to the second island by a concerned couple (Tea Leoni and William Macy), they are once again chased by bizarre creatures. There are many brilliantly executed set-pieces, photographed in realistic CGI to a pulsating score and with only a few cornball conversations; the direction is great.  In between the mayhem are scenes of great visual beauty as we view some gigantic, spreckled Diplodicuses and other beautifully rendered creatures - no phony-looking ones here. Even the opening credits are very imaginative. The ending opens it up for a fourth in the series - hope it happens!",Jurassic Park III

The entire film is little more than an excuse to put a bunch of people on a dino-infested island.That being said, it's actually a more entertaining movie than ""The Lost World."" It's professionally made, with some good action/chase sequences. Plus, it has the good sense not to overstay its welcome--it's only an hour and a half long, atypical in today's mega-blockbuster market. The ending is rushed and more than a bit convenient.

195,TheMovieDoctorful,"An Insult, A Disgrace, An Absolute Betrayal To The Jurassic Park Franchise",1,17 December 2018,"I like Joe Johnston. The Wolfman is an underrated masterpiece, Captain America: The First Avenger is probably the best MCU film and The Rocketeer is one of the better 90s superhero movies. So how, God almighty, how, did he create something as irredeemably and unforgivably awful as this? Jurassic Park III is a spit to the face to everything that made me love this franchise, disrespectful to its legacy at best and an insulting betrayal to everything it stands for at worst. I hate Johnston's Jurassic Park III almost as much as I love his Wolfman remake.The way this film ruins Alan Grant's character really doesn't get mentioned enough. Grant here is a self centered, miserable, greedy, unnuanced, cranky dickhead. Remember that scene in the original Jurassic Park where he's explaining to Lex how the carnivorous dinosaurs of the island aren't necessarily bad, just an aggressive part of a natural ecosystem? (""The other kind aren't bad, they just...Do what they do."") Well you can forget all about that here, a film where he speaks on a pulpit like a fire-and-brimstone preacher about how they're ""genetically engineered theme park monsters"" who need to be destroyed, later whining about how they deserve it because they tried to eat him. He has to be tricked and bribed into saving a child for Pete's sake!The other characters aren't that much better. Most of them are just shallow and empty archetypes with zero characterization (The workaholic parent, the badass kid, the reckless pupil, e.t.c) that are hardly worth remembering, let alone liking. Then there's Tea Leoni's Amanda Kirby, who is almost as unlikable as this film's version of Grant. Her only characterization here appears to be screaming unconvincingly and being as loud and obnoxious as possible because this film thinks that's funny. It's hard to believe watching this how this was once a franchise lauded for its relatively feminist depiction of women in a very male-dominated genre of Sci-Fi (It's telling how this and the original Jurassic World are both the worst franchise installments, as well as the least female empowering ones.) The only form of development any of these characters get is the stock ""workaholic parents are finally there for their family"" that we've seen in God knows how many bad family movies.Speaking of Tea Leoni, nobody gives a good performance in this. Yes, that includes Sam Neil, who is clearly sleep walking his way through a paycheck role that he seems to have active contempt for. He underacts as much as Leoni overacts, not that the screenplay gives him anything to work with in terms of its flaccid, pathetically weak dialogue. William H. Macy's performance is similarly phoned in; show up, be quirky in a very William H. Macy way, collect the check and leave. Nobody in this cast had any passion, nobody cared.This film talks a big game with lines about how InGen ""play(s) God"" and how certain characters are ""no better than the people who built this place"" but it all goes nowhere. It's mentioned and never expanded upon so that the movie can feel more mature and adult than it actually is. Jurassic Park III is a film that goes absolutely nowhere thematically and literally talks about nothing. It wants to feel epic without actually being epic. Without actually earning that title. It's like a High School student who lazily slaps together a school paper on Romeo & Juliet in 20 minutes and then expects to get an A+. It'a anti-ambition and it's infuriating.For a series so traditionally dependent on visual storytelling, the film lacks any kind of awe and wonder. It's a hollow Horror show, a great, big shock-fest to see which hollow caricatures can die first and how. Sure, Jurassic Park has always had an element of terror, but it also had a deep element of (For lack of a better term) humanity to it. The best of these films were about the power of nature, both to horrify as well to shock and enchant. There is nothing to be enchanted by here. None of the dinosaurs here have any personality beyond being mindless, vicious killing machines that stalk our main characters like Jason Voorhees, even when they're reasonably full and fed. Don't even get me started on the Spinosaurus, a dinosaur with a boring design whose sole personality trait is to be a ""cooler"" and ""edgier"" T-Rex for a new generation of wide-eyed youths. Even as a kid, I hated this pretender to the role of franchise icon and his killing of the iconic T-Rex felt like a massive piss over everyone who grew to care for this franchise. The film only has one moment where it so much as attempts a moment of genuine heart with these creatures, but it's so unearned and out of left field with such a poor CGI render that it's just laughable. If these are truly what the dinosaurs of Jurassic Park have become, maybe Grant's terrible, misguided, out of character like about ""genetically engineered theme park monsters"" isn't so inaccurate.Jurassic Park III also has no idea what tone it's going for at all. It'll showcase extremely dark imagery at times with its graphic death scenes, and its musical score definitely takes on the darkest tone of any Jurassic Park film to date, but then engages in weird comedic gags like talking raptors and jokes about T-Rex pee. Nothing meshes here. It's a mashup of ideas that aren't coherent and don't blend with each other at all.Jurassic Park III is an absolute travesty, the kind of disastrous sequel that should be mentioned with the likes of Aliens vs. Predator: Requiem and Book of Shadows: Blair Witch 2. Even thinking about it gets me somewhat angry at how much this missed the mark to anything resembling a quality film. How people sit back and tell me this is a better film than The Lost World is beyond me.",Jurassic Park III

If it's going to be as much fun as this one, I wouldn't mind a few more sequels. The Jurassic Park concept is a fresh source for many exciting stories if you just find the right spin. JP3 found it.   The movie makes sense and the plot works quite well. The relationships between the characters are quite cliche, especially the divorced couple who joins forces to rescue their child and by doing so they rekindle their love. But it works. The cast is superb and you really care for those character (in fact, it's not hard to figure out quite early on in the movie who's cannon fodder and who's going to survive).    The dinosaurs are great looking as usual, but the thrills are also exciting and original. We are even treated to a brief fight between two big dinosaurs and some new dinosaurs species that were featured in the original book, but were absent from the first two movies.   I only think that the climax could have slightly more... Er... Climatic, and considering how frightening the evil dinosaurs are, it's a bit of a shame that the movie is not really scary or gorey.

198,jaredpahl,Amusing Dino Adventure Without The Sophistication or Craftsmanship of Spielberg's Originals,7,5 October 2015,"I must admit, straight away, that Jurassic Park is one of my favorite movie franchises of all-time. I have a special place in my heart for Steven Spielberg's one-two punch of Jurassic Park and The Lost World. Both films represent, to me, the absolute zenith of blockbuster filmmaking. More than just the game-changing special effects, it was smart writing, endearing characters, and a savory buffet of craftsmanship that made those films stand out from the crowd. For the third Jurassic Park movie, the directorial torch was passed to Joe Johnston, and predictably, the result is a film that seems like it comes from another universe. Jurassic Park 3 is nowhere near the level of the first two Jurassic Park movies, and I suppose for those less enthusiastic about the series, that may be a dealbreaker. For me? Well, I was able to get past it. The clear step down in quality may take some getting used to (maybe even a couple of viewings), but I found that once I made peace with the fact that JP3 isn't an A-caliber blockbuster, what I was left with was a good B-caliber blockbuster; A breezy little summertime thrill ride with some fun dinosaur action. And come on, who doesn't love dinosaurs?Was Jurassic Park 3 really a necessary sequel? Was there some story waiting to be told? Some unanswered questions or themes to explore? Of course not. You can smell the studio's fingerprints all over Jurassic Park 3's script. The story is best described as a question, ""How do we get Alan Grant back to a dinosaur-infested island?"" The writers, Peter Buchman, Alexander Payne, and Jim Taylor, answer this question, but after that, they've got nothing. After Grant is duped by a divorced couple into visiting Site B in order to find their missing son, the film is just a chase picture, or maybe you could call it a wander picture, because there really is no urgency to the group's plan. Just get off the island, is about the extent of it. Tea Leoni and William H. Macy play the divorced couple, and they are good as typical Midwestern, suburban parents. Sam Neil's return as paleontologist Alan Grant is one of the few welcome sights in the character department. Neil does some classy work, and it is nice to see him back after he sat The Lost World out. The other characters, with the exception of the kid, are basically dino food from the beginning, and I do mean the beginning. Jurassic Park 3 wastes little time getting to what we all paid to see, dinosaurs eating, chasing, and just downright harassing humans. From the very start of the film, with a cartoony title card that shows a raptor claw slashing ""///"" through the Jurassic Park logo, it's apparent that this Jurassic Park does not take itself near as seriously as the first two do. There is not much effort given to building tension, which was at least half the appeal of Spielberg's movies. No time spent preparing us for the eventual running... and screaming. No, it's just all-out action from the very moment Grant arrives on the island. The dinosaurs themselves have taken the leap from lifelike animals to movie monsters. They chase and eat and roar. Why? Because they're dinosaurs, that's why. You won't hear any talk of maternal instincts here. Jurassic Park 3 aims for the basic visceral thrills of the series, and Johnston hits that target. Watching people run from dinosaurs is a lot of fun, no matter the context, but Johnston and company do construct some truly rousing set-pieces. The Spinosaurus vs T-Rex fight is a neat little 'Why Not?' moment, and the trip into the Pterodactyl cage is bigger in scale than anything from the previous two films. You don't get much in the way of tension in JP 3's action scenes, but they move along nicely, and they're well mounted for sure. The special effects, while not quite on the same level as its predecessor's (despite coming out four years after), are still effective. When it comes to realizing extinct creatures in three dimensions, ILM and Stan Winston are still a quantum leap in front of everybody else.Jurassic Park 3 is a textbook definition of 'disappointment'. It's a sequel that lacks the passion, spark, and creative talent of its predecessors. I hated it the first time I saw it, but as time goes by, I find it harder and harder to dislike. It works like a thrill ride at Disney World or Universal Studios. A quick pre-ride set up, and then it's time to strap in for non-stop dinosaur action. Jurassic Park 3 doesn't claim to offer more than those basic thrill ride pleasures, but those pleasures are enough for me. For summer matinée fare, you could do much worse.72/100",Jurassic Park III
199,domtaylor,The lack of Spielberg is evident.,5,10 July 2018,"Director Joe Johnston took the reigns from Spielberg for this third entry into the 'Jurassic' franchise, and that meant that 'Jurassic Park III' became the worst entry in it. Although this film is more enjoyable than 'The Lost World', in its own self-aware 'B-movie' way, it isn't technically as good due to the lack of the franchise's main ingredient: Spielberg. Where 'The Lost World' surpasses this one is in Spielberg's execution of that film's action scenes. The story for this entry and the previous are about as silly as each other's and, while Johnston clearly embraced that better than Spielberg, he didn't know how to create tension or suspense in any of the action segments. Instead, they feel rather bland and, in some cases, actually rather funny, which makes this feel like a joke entry in the franchise. Even Sam Neill and Laura Dern aren't great and seem out of character, which is probably due to the screenplay and change of director rather than them. Overall, 'Jurassic Park III' is pretty bad, but at least it feels as if it knows that fact and, because of that, the audience can embrace the goofiness of it all and garner some sort of mild entertainment out of it. 5/10.",Jurassic Park III

We know what they looked like, we know where they lived, and everything else is guess work. This movie gives dinasours an intelligence level that is not justified.

204,moviemattb,My least favorite of the series,6,14 June 2015,"If I had to admit, this was the first ""Jurassic Park"" movie that I saw in a theater. Not the first, and certainly not the second. Just this one that I am reviewing. This came first just before I saw the first one being brought back in 2013 in 3D. With that said, the movie is about Alan Grant who is a survivor from the first one as he is still studying dinosaurs as he has been offered by a couple to be their tour guide as he brings Billy along, and things turned out to be a set up. They pretty much kidnapped him for his help to find their lost son, Eric who has been missing for eight weeks. So they go out to find their son, and try to get back home. This whole premise as you are reading really does play out like a B movie as you may have seen in any other movies that carries the same scenario. I first once did like this movie, but as time goes by it doesn't hold up really well. I don't hate it, but I don't consider this to be the absolute worst. I say it is the weakest, but not the worst of the worst. What is good and bad about this movie? The good is that it is really nice to have Sam Neill come back as he does give a good performance, and pretty much the best character in the movie. The other cast all did fine, but there was nothing much to root for. I can like two or three characters, but the others were just there. The music by Don Davis is very well scored as it does have some of that ""Jurassic Park"" feeling. The special effects are again like the second film, where they are parts that look slightly dated but for the most part they are really good. It has some neat actions, but nothing much to say about. The bad is that I don't think Joe Johnston does a good on making the movie. He did okay, but he just keeps missing on the boat. Also, the pacing is only an hour and a half long. When I first saw this movie, I was like ""Really? That's it?"" It just leaves me to wanting more, because it needed more action and excitements. The story is what it is, and never I find it original. In spite of some of the issues that I had, I can still watch it as a time waster and I can't hate it because I grew up with it. Overall, the movie was okay. I know many people can like this one over the second, but I can take the second one over this because there is so much to like while this one may have its moments but its just not that good. You can decide whether you want a ""Jurassic Park"" movie that is directed by Steven Spielberg or just go by at a quicker pace; it is all up to you. To me, I just want a good movie. So, in conclusion, ""Jurassic Park III"" is by far my least favorite, but it is indeed watchable. I give it a 6 out of 10.",Jurassic Park III
205,gattonero975,Billy's Backpack,7,27 September 2020,"All in all Jurassic Park part 3 was not bad.Sam Neill and Laura Dern came back for this one! Sam Neill was now the main star of the film while Laura Dern was regulated to a small and brief cameo role. I like when we first see Sam and Laura I was under the impression that they were now married and had kids but it was in-joke as Sam's character was just visiting Laura who is now married to some other guy and is out of the dinosaur business per se William H Macy and Tea Leoni first appear as a married couple but in reality they were a divorced couple who got together because of their son's disappearance as he was on vacation with his new stepdad Mark Harelik. Mark had a very brief role in the beginning of the film and then he was never seen again I remember him right away as Milos from a Seinfeld episode back in the day lol Bill Macy was good but Leoni's annoying character started to get on my nerves. Bill did the best he could but he and T had no chemistry whatsoever so it was kind of hard to swallow that they were once married and had a kid together but that's Hollywood . Alessandro nivola as Sams Young Apprentice was well cast. The three mercenary Musketeers played by Michael Jeter, John Diehl and Bruce A Young had very brief roles?! They killed off fairly quickly!But like I said Joe Johnston's film is basically a homage to Ray harryhausen go Motion dinosaurs and I appreciate that. I even like Sam Neill Grant character emplifying Indiana Jones! there are quite a few scenes where is Sam where's the same type of hat / fedora that Indie uses! At one point when Sam is in the plane taking a nap he takes off his hat and puts it in his face just like Indie did and his films! Plus Sam Neill has always had that devilish eyebrow is I like Jack Nicholson so makes me wonder how Sam Neill could have played Indiana Jones or he could have played like Indiana Jones brother that would have been amazing,
last but not least there was a Jurassic Park 3 reunions of sorts , even though they did not share any scenes in this movie ,the actor who played the very brief role of the ill-fated captain of the boat in the intro of the film Julio Oscar Mechoso, would 16 years later guest star with on Tea Leoni's TV series Madam Secretary ,season 3 episode 14 ,""Labor of Love"" as the character Mateo.
Unfortunately this would be Julio Oscar last screen appearance as he passed away, at the age of 62, of a heart attack shortly after that guest appearance.",Jurassic Park III

But not great like Jurassic Park,8,31 July 2017,"Jurassic Park III (2001) is an adventure science fiction film directed by Joe Johnston The film is the summer release of July 21, 2001 in the united states and is the third sequel to the Jurassic Park Franchise beginning in 1993. Tells of a lost child on the island of Isla Sorna, for weeks his parents can not find him, he invites survivors of the tragedy in Isla Nublar. They went to Isla Sorna. But the danger of destroying them all, seeing the ancient life, chased by carnivorous dinosaurs, survived on the island .. And found the boy ..

207,japamo,"Pure, Unadulterated, Efficient, Confident, Fun Dinosaur Adventure",8,26 June 2012,"Jurassic Park III (hereafter JPIII) is essentially JPI or JPII without the excessive environmental, industrial, and genetic ethical moralizing. JPIII is simply content to pit humans vs. dinosaurs as the humans seek to escape the dinosaur domain alive, and does so, as I said in the title, efficiently, confidently, and entertainingly. Unlike the first sequel, which gave us the brave but bemused and not dinosaur-savvy Ian Malcolm (Jeff Goldblum) JPIII has the good sense to reintroduce rugged, resourceful, Indiana-Jones-like paleontologist Dr. Alan Grant in a latest attempt to save someone from dinosaur-infested Isla Sorna. That someone is resourceful, plucky 12-year old survivalist Eric Kirby (Trevor Morgan), stranded by a parasailing mishap. Eric is certainly a refreshing improvement upon the first sequel's whiny, peevish Kelly (Vanessa Chester). A third plus, at least initially, is Dr. Grant's able, young, handsome graduate student assistant Billy Brennan (Alessandro Nivola), who comes along for the rescue attempt.Somewhat unfortunately, JPIII counterbalances these competent characters with Eric's nondescript parents: Paul Kirby (William H. Macy) who poses as a wealthy businessman willing to subsidize Dr. Grant's research in exchange for his son's rescue, and Amanda Kirby (Téa Leoni), Paul's tenderfoot ex-wife. Both participate in the rescue, even after Paul reveals he is merely a hardware store owner, and Dr. Grant exasperatedly punches him for the hoax.Off the quartet goes to Isla Sorna, where they are, naturally, stranded when a gigantic carnivorous Spinosaurus dismantles their aircraft and slays the mercenaries accompanying the group for protection. Despite their encounters with the Spinosaurus and T-rex, the latter which is killed in a vicious knockdown battle, the quartet becomes a quintet when they find Eric quite alive and quite well near an enormous aviary. The Spinosaurus was the first new angle in JPIII, the second is the eventual discovery of towering winged Pteranodons nesting within the aviary. The Pteranodons chase them as well. The group's progress is impeded by Eric's out-of-their-element parents, and, surprisingly, by Billy's appropriation of velociraptor eggs in a misguided attempt to fund Dr. Grant's research. Dr. Grant discovers the theft and severely chides Billy as no better than an avaricious corporate suit. Billy redeems himself by using a parasail to save Eric from a pteranodon's clutches and disappearing into a stream. The remaining group drive off the attacking Spinosaur with a crane and a boat fire, escape a surrounding pack of velociraptors by communicating with a shell that simulates their cries and giving back their eggs, and manage to contact Dr. Ellie Satler (Laura Dern) with an elusive cell phone for help in getting off the island. They get off the island, find Billy injured but safe, and see the freed pteranodons fly off the island for a possible third sequel.I liked JPIII because it is a stripped-down, just-long-enough, straightforward dinosaur adventure. Furthermore, we learn more about more dinosaurs (carnivores and herbivores) and realize they are far more than villains that chase and eat people. Also, the characters, even Eric's stereotypically clueless parents, test their mettle and will for survival and eventually earn our respect. Finally, the CGI beasties are as awe-inspiring as ever and advance in our estimation because of Dr. Grant's scholarly admiration of them. One can find lapses in JPIII, such as the T-Rex's willingness to leave the carcass it's feeding on to chase little humans, and a 40-pound pteranodon's questionable ability to pick up an 80-pound kid (besides pteranodons are fish-eaters). Nevertheless, JPIII is a thrilling, suspenseful ride (especially the sequence when Dr. Grant desperately calls Ellie on the slippery cell phone, gets her 3-year old son instead, and tries to get the Barney-distracted child to get mommy on the line). And yes, it's much better and more intelligent than The Lost World, and on a par with the first Jurassic Park.P.S.: After three ""Jurassic Park"" movies, what's left for the putative third sequel to cover? Okay, we have the escaped pteranodons. But is that enough? All I can think of is that unscrupulous InGen scientists somehow obtain the dinosaur zygotes from the first movie, perform some cross-breeding on the mainland, and create new dinosaur hybrids, including humanoid dinosaurs (from the velociraptor embryos).",Jurassic Park III
208,kyle_c,* 1/2 out of ****,4,15 September 2002,"Pointless sequel has few redeeming values.  The acting is little more than mediocre, despite a very strong cast.  The script is able to build no tension whatsoever and offers little in the way of an interesting storyline, not to mention its horribly cliched and ridiculous attempts at character development.  Basically, the series is starting to get a little bit too familiar and this entry has very little to offer, even to fans of this type of film.",Jurassic Park III
209,mitchell5954,Dumb But Entertaining,5,11 January 2019,"Jurassic Park 3 is considered the low point in the franchise. It's certainly the worst film in terms of quality and it is, by far, the lowest grossing film of the bunch. Most people hate this movie and I can see why. I can't defend it as a good movie. The Lost World I will defend as being underrated, but this one I can't. However, I still enjoy it as a fun timewaster. It's a guilty pleasure for sure. Perhaps it's because of fond nostalgia? This was the first Jurassic park movie I saw in the theatre. I bought the toys to this. Back then I remember this being my favorite Jurassic Park movie. Of course, at that time all I cared about was dinosaur action.The plot is super simple. A kid named Eric goes parasailing with a friend near Site B from The Lost World which is still inhabited by dinosaurs. They end up getting stranded there and Eric's parents Paul (William H. Macy) and Amanda (Tea Leoni), gather a rescue team to find him. Among the rescue team unknowingly are Dr. Grant (Sam Neil) and his partner Billy. They themselves get stranded and now must find Eric and get off the island while running from dinosaurs who want to eat them.The main reason I enjoy this film is because Sam Neil returns as Dr. Grant who is my favorite character of the franchise. Sam Neil I find to be one of the most underrated actors at least in American cinema. It's a shame he doesn't get more work as he's one of my favorite actors.The rest of the cast is pretty subpar. This film probably sports the weakest cast of all the movies though Jurassic World comes at a close second. The best character, by far, is Dr. Grant but he can't save the cast. The only other notable characters here are Billy and Eric. William H. Macy does a good job with what he has. His character is really nothing but he has some entertaining bits.The film looks good. The effects are below the first two given that they got a different effects team, but they're still pretty good for the most part. Though, some effects do look pretty dated like some of the animatronic effects for the Spinosaurus. Besides that the setting and sets still look great and builds atmosphere.Unlike all the other films, Jurassic Park 3 is the only one without a human antagonist, which I am honestly fine with. I'm sick to death of the two dimensional money-grubbing villains in this franchise. Been there done that.Above all I found the film entertaining. If you want a more philosophical film that the first two films had with the message of man tampering with nature then you won't find it here. They through all that out in favor of just having a straightforward and entertaining survival flick. For me it was fun despite some annoying characters, dumb plot threads, and a laundry list of things that make zero sense.Overall, I can see why so many hate this film. I know it isn't good. However, I enjoy it as a fun monster b-movie. If you just want an entertaining monster movie to watch then you can give this look. If you want something like the first two films than you will be disappointed.",Jurassic Park III

211,TheSeaLion,A dinosaur attack film that brings nothing new,3,16 August 2013,"""Jurassic Park III"" is a perfect example of a film that finally brings down the entire series. ""Jurassic Park"" and ""The Lost World"" excelled at the premise of dinosaurs on an island and then along comes ""Jurassic Park III"" to cause the film, let alone the entire franchise, to go down the drain. Within this film are fatal mistakes that destroys the movie as a whole.The film is just a dinosaur attack film. Yes, ""The Lost World"" is like that too, but ""Jurassic Park III"" can not even do what its predecessor did to make it work on some note. ""The Lost World"" had the herbivores also be dangerous. ""Jurassic Park III"" made it so the carnivores are dangerous and the herbivores are friendly to humans. With that in place, the humans go running through herds of dinosaurs that are actually just as dangerous as the raptors that are chasing them. To add to the annoyance of the dinosaur attack film, the first thing that happens when the group settles down is that plane is attacked and two people are eaten by the Spinosaurus.Nothing new is added to the film. The entire reason there is a film is because someone got stuck on the island and the group goes to rescue them. If I recall correctly, that is the same reason there was a plot in ""The Lost World"". Even minor moments are stolen from the other films like Billy has a lucky bag, same as Sarah. The plane crashes because of the main dinosaur, the trailers are destroyed by the main dinosaur. And so on. Actually, the nothing new thing is a lie. They had new dinosaurs and new dinosaurs attack. They redid the raptors, replaced the T-Rex with the Spinosaurus, and added Pteranodons as another dinosaur to attack. The writers spent little time working on an original story that was not done in the previous movie and instead spent time adding and changing the dinosaurs.The film is poorly written, complete with comical and one dimensional characters, dinosaurs that bring nothing interesting, and has no tension because there are no twists on who will make it or what the dinosaurs or the characters are going to do. All in all, ""Jurassic Park III"" is the worst film of the ""Jurassic Park"" franchise and a bad movie altogether.",Jurassic Park III
212,Keyser Soze-12,"WOW! Think Dino Crisis: The Movie. A few Spoilers, BUT NOTHING MAJOR. This is pure entertainment!",7,22 July 2001,"Man, I really wasn't expecting this.  Like most sane people, I loved the first Jurassic Park.  And, also like most sane people, I didn't care for the second. It was a real shame they screwed that up because the book was so good.  Eh, I'll save that rant for another review.  But, when I was going into Jurassic Park 3, I wasn't expecting much.  I knew the story would be about as flat as paper and the characters would suck.  Well, I was right.Ask yourself, what was wrong with JP2?  I'll tell you.  The movie had too many characters with too many motives and had a plot with a hundred pointless turns.  The thing that made Jurassic Park work so well was the situation.  A bunch of people in a theme park attacked by the attractions. The added plus was the attractions were dinosaurs.  The second movie has a bunch of people going to another island for no real reason.  Okay, there was reason, but it was still stupid.This is where JP3 comes in.  Grant does not want to go to the island.  In fact, he's kidnapped (which is the only good plot twist in this movie). Once the movies gets to the island, a giant chase sequence begins.  I heavily enjoyed this movie because it showed us more dinosaurs with less plot.  The Lost World tried to camouflage the stupid situation with a complex plot.  But Jurassic Park III never tries that.  It knows how stupid it is.  Basically here's the movie: People get on the island, dinosaurs chase people, people get off the island.  Oh come on, you know there is a happy ending.  I won't tell you who lives and dies though.The fun of this movie is not the plot; it's the TERRIFIC dinosaur action. This movie takes a more realistic look at the dinosaurs and a scarier one too.  The special effects are amazing.  One of the greatest scenes in the movie happens in the beginning when a T-Rex (everyone's favorite carnivore) gets into a fight with a Spinosaur (a much bigger dinosaur I have never heard of).  The camera moves around the fighting beasts in a handheld shot, panning 360 degrees.  I must say, I was worried about ILM with the Mummy Returns's crappy special effects, but they have REALLY redeemed themselves now.  The Pterodactyl sequences are equally amazing.So, in conclusion, this is not a movie for you ""Film Scholar"" people who think Brazil and Dark City are the greatest movies ever made.  This isn't for you hip writers who think David Mamet is God.  This is for the average Joe who wants to see some Dinosaurs eat some people.  I am a huge action movie fan, and let me tell you, this movie has some of the most breathtaking action sequences I have ever seen.  I have two sides to me: the film side and the movie side.  The film side is the guy who likes Mamet, David Fincher, and other artistic stuff.  The movie guy loves good popcorn movies.  Believe it or not, they were both impressed with JP3.  The film guy was amazed at the camera work and special effects work while the movie guy was just impressed by the cool dinos. Sure the beginning and ending suck.  Sure it has an unbelievable plot twist (it involves the kid, but I'm not telling you what it is).  Sure the dialog is horrible and the characters (other than Grant) are stupid.  But the whole movie isn't made for these things.  It is made to impress you with cool dino action.  I was also impressed how the movie manages to make fun of itself and it's predecessors.  Several satirical jokes are made that I found rather amusing.  So, in final conclusion, if you don't like this movie, well, you're no fun. 
Oh, PS: this isn't a kids movie, folks.  I know JP and JP2 were family friendly, but this one isn't.  The dinosaurs are extremely realistic, so just think about that.  Real dinosaurs aren't like Barney; they're monsters and I can guarantee your kid (5 yr to 10 yr) will be scarred for life if you take him into this.  This is more of a horror movie than an adventure movie. There were several small girls in my theater when I saw this, and boy-howdie did they cry and moan, ""Are the dinos coming back!?  Don't let them come back mommy!"".  Oh, and don't take them to AI either.",Jurassic Park III
213,stevetseitz,"Ignore ""Lost World"" this is a worthy sequel",8,20 July 2001,"This movie was a well crafted piece of action-entertainment. It's not ""Lawrence of Arabia"" but if you went to the movie with expectations that high you need to have your head examined. The dinosaurs were seamless and the picture moved along at just the right pace, it told it's story without turning into a theme-park ride. I particularly liked the battle between the Tyrannosaurus Rex and the Spinosaurus (I'm not sure that is the correct spelling) it reminded me of ""King Kong"" where Kong battles the T-Rex.",Jurassic Park III
214,smashattack,Reminder of the original Jurassic Park.,5,7 December 2001,"This movie has excellent graphics and good, deep characters.  It is almost a remake of the original Jurassic Park, and that's why it's so much better than The Lost World.  This one tends to value life a little more than The Lost World, and I think these are the two reasons this movie is so underrated. The movie gets a lot more in-depth with the characters, instead of The Lost World's attempt at making new characters who were just there to be killed and give the main characters something to worry about. The movie introduces a new gargantuan dinosaur:  the Spinosaurus.  Man, this thing is awesome.  It is as big as a T-Rex and is tougher (seeing a fight between the two is a very special treat). Once again, the special effects and even the music (which is now done by Ron Davis) makes this movie a true Jurassic Park movie.  Michael Crichton even contributed by writing for the characters. This is a movie not to miss, especially if you like the Jurassic Park Saga.",Jurassic Park III
215,smashattack,"Actually, it is a walk in the park...",5,16 November 2002,"I already wrote my comments about this film, but they were inadequate for what I really feel about this movie.  So here I go again.Jurassic Park was most definitely one of the greatest movies ever made.  It combined the enthralling special effects of Steven Spielberg, the creative genius of Stan Winston, the writing of the talented Michael Crichton, and the excellent themes of John Williams.  In other words, it was very near perfection.The Lost World was a flop.  And Jurassic Park III is obviously an attempt to get the series back into gear.When I first started watching the movie, I didn't feel the same excitement that the first one brought.  Quite possibly because of the new director.  Or maybe Don Davis' disgusting themes.  Or perhaps it was just because it tried to hard to look like the first one.  But somehow I felt that Jurassic Park III was separated from the other two, that Alan Grant was totally different. We didn't even get to see Mr. Hammond.The special effects aren't as great as its predecessors.  The T-Rex is barely believable; something just looks wrong with it.  The spinosaurus is nothing compared to the sheer magnificence of the T-Rex in the first movie. It just doesn't have the power to drop your jaw, most likely because it has a lame entrance and is not much different from the T-Rex anyway.The actors do really well, I think.  Sam Neill remains one of my favorites, and Alan Grant has also been a favorite character of mine for a long time.The concept of going back to Isla Sorna and finding something new (the spinosaurus) is kind of weird.  It doesn't even seem like the same island as it was on The Lost World.  The compound is not the same, and the raptors look different.  One thing I do like, however, is that this movie is a little brighter.  In The Lost World, it was almost always night, making it a very dark movie.  This one wasn't so nasty.  But the first one had the perfect balance, combining both day and night.  This one is too bright.The plot is obviously not one of Crichton's.  Unfortunately, this movie is not based on one of his books.  However, that may be a good thing, considering how badly The Lost World was ripped apart in the conversion from writing to screen.  But it's easily discerned as not Crichton's work.Don Davis' music is simply awful.  He attempts to re-use the main themes in the exact same spots they were used in Jurassic Park, which didn't fly well with me.  They needed John Williams in there.  I have never liked Don Davis since his performance in the Matrix, and he certainly didn't do well here. His music is kind of screechy, lacking any themes other than Williams' originals.But Jurassic Park III is a little more like the first one, which makes it better than The Lost World.  I enjoyed the thrill ride (although extremely predictable) and expect to see better things when Jurassic Park IV is released.Despite my hard opinion of this movie, I actually enjoyed it and would recommend it to any thrill lover, especially those who are fond of the Jurassic Park series.",Jurassic Park III
216,pumpkinhead_lance,A Fun Return to Isla Sorna! ***1/2 out of 5,10,10 July 2005,"Jurassic Park III is the first one to be directed by someone other than Spielberg. Joe Johnston does a really good job though. It's obviously going to have a different approach to the material because of this, but ultimately it works quite well.Admittedly, it's a significantly different kind of film. It's extremely fast paced and by this I mean you have the cast already on the island and being pursued by the main dinosaur on the JP3 logo within the first 15 minutes! There are some things that seem unanswered in the film but overall I feel these things can be looked over. Also the sprinkled attempts at humor had me laughing but at the same time had me raising my eyebrows because it felt slightly out of place in the world of Jurassic Park.The film is a lot shorter. It's about an hour an a half as opposed to the other films being over two hours long. So overall as you can see, it's quite a bit different from the other two. But this is a Joe Johnston film, not a Steven Spielberg film and I feel the director shouldn't try to totally duplicate what was done before him and that he needs to make his own movie. Just so long as he doesn't change things around so drastically that it is no longer the same. Thankfully Johnston still captures that old adventurous Jurassic Park feeling and provides highly memorable and breathtaking action sequences. Sam Neill, who is one of my favorite actors, is back and reprises his role as Dr. Grant and it's really great to see him back in the hat! While the plot may be very simplistic the film does enrich the world of Jurassic Park. Obviously Ingen is still up to no good and creating dinosaurs that weren't originally 'on the list' as was stated. Here we have the addition of the Spinosaurus, Ankylosaurus, and various other dinos.The music by Don Davis is superb. He integrates the memorable themes by John Williams and uses them superbly in his own original music.The special effects by ILM are terrific as ever. Some of my favorite big moments being the confrontation between the T-Rex and Spinosaurus, The Bird Cage sequence (especially the build up to where the Pterondon is walking on the bridge) and the Brachiosaurus greeting the boat. It's a fantastic quick journey back to the island of dinosaurs and I must say it's a fun and highly memorable one!",Jurassic Park III
217,mrskywalker,Intense and Good flick,10,19 July 2001,This Jurassic Park was actually my favorite.  It had an old fashioned plot with the most modern effects.  The dinosaur action was the crispest of the 3 films.  There were some truly edge if your seat moments and we actually cared if someone survived or not.  No doubt this was a tough audience with criticism long before the movie began.There was a scene with a cell phone that actually symbolically told the hecklers where the director thinks they belong.  I believe he anticipated this.  You will have to see it to understand.If you are looking for a film that has social statements this is not it. This is good old fashioned action with the finest in sound and visual effects.  It is also interesting.  I rank it only behind Mummy Returns this Summer.,Jurassic Park III

223,dalton2,What's this...?,5,27 July 2001,"I can't believe that Jurassic Park 3 has the same name of the original Spielberg's film. This is nothing but a series of CGI effects (not the best ones you will see these days by the way) and several actors doing what they told them to do but with no spirit at all. The feeling is the same as the one you would get if they had had troubles during filming and had had to finish the film because they were paid to do so. And what about the script...? It's simply a collection of nonsense. Almost every scene is a carbon copy of Jurassic Park's. I couldn't give credit to my eyes when Alan accepted (again) to go to the island for money. Incredible but true. The music is like they had the Jurassic Park sountrack CD and used it. There's nothing new, just the same themes for each scene. And what's the relationship between Alan Grant and Ellie Satler? Are they married? Are the kids his sons? It seems like they aren't married, but, where is her husband? They don't say a single word about that in the whole film. It seems like they don't know what will be best in Jurassic Park 4. Yes, that's something really evident in many scenes. And it's also evident that Jeff Goldblum didn't accept to do this horrible film (or perhaps asked for a lot of money) and thus he wasn't here. That explains that scene where Eric Kirby tells Alan Grant that he also read Ian Malcolm's book, and that he thinks he's too clever by half. That line (those aren't the exact words anyway) doesn't make sense at all with what we saw in JP and JP2, and it sounds like a sentence for Goldblum's future in JP4.My only hope is not to see more Jurassic Parks... at least in this horrible line. But I'm afraid my expectations will be in vain. ""Jurassic"" + ""Park"" are a couple of words which are as attractive as, let's say, ""Coca"" + ""Cola"", and they don't need a good film anymore, just those two words in the title.Please don't go to see this film, don't give them more money to do such horrible things. It's the only way to make them understand.4-5 out of 10.",Jurassic Park III
224,drawlife,"It's dumb fun, but nothing more.",5,4 December 2014,"This Jurassic Park is just for pure spectacle. At this point, who cares about what happens and how they end up in the island, all we care about are the dinosaurs, and that is what we get. The cool thing about this film is the return of Dr. Alan Grant. Sam Niell effortlessly slides back into the role quite well, and should provide comfort food for Jurassic Park fans like myself and others. If anything in this film, aside from the dinosaurs are worthy of your time and attention, it's Dr. Grant. We also have a nice cameo from Laura Dern who returns as Ellie Sattler. The new cast are kind of expendable. I did in particular liked Alessandro Nivola's character Billy, but I didn't care for the rest of the mercenaries or the couple who are looking for their missing son portrayed by Tea Leoni and William H. Macy. Trevor Morgan plays their son Erik in the film, but like the previous installments that always involved children, it has a very been there and done that feel. This time around I didn't buy into the reason why everyone was forced to go back to that island once more. I thought overall, the film was thinly written, sloppy dialog, and just kind of shoehorned in. I mean after the events of the first two films, it's well known and publicized that dinosaurs exist once more so why in the world would anyone attempt to go near that island. Also, going into spoiler territory here, but if Ellie is able to rescue Grant and the others, by calling the US navy and the marines, why didn't the Kirby's(Macy and Leoni) do that to rescue their son? I also found that Malcolm's excuse to go back to that island was kinda lame in the second film, but he was forced into it because of his girlfriend, but for Dr. Grant, even if he was bribed by the Kirby's, he's smarter than that. But I guess money can change people's mind. Despite the characters repeating the same mistakes and getting into same situations again, the pacing is brisk and the dinosaurs are as cool as ever with some impressive visuals. We now see the Pteranodons in full action and they're just as deadly. The Velociraptors never fail to be threatening and vicious and this third entry displays their intelligence even more which was quite intriguing to watch. The Spinosaurus is introduced, and new dinosaur villain and single-handedly destroys the T-Rex. One thing I can always commend for the Jurassic Park franchise is their smart use of blending animatronics and cgi together. To simply put it, despite it's flaws, its fun and a good time to kill 90 minutes. 5.6/10",Jurassic Park III
225,Jonah14,30 minutes too short,5,18 July 2001,"There were so many red herrings introduced (T-Rex urine, huge guns, etc), but none of them were employed in the movie. Morever, there didn't seem to be a third act or even a climax. This movie felt like it ended 30 minutes too soon - and at 90 minutes, it seems definitely way too short.Nice to see a cameo by Laura Dern, though. Great action, but were was the final battle with the Spineosaurus? And what a lame ending concerning the velociraptors. If I were the screenwriter, I'd have the raptors, after taking the eggs, become vicious again. The group takes out the T-Rex urine, and splashes it all over the raptors. The raptors become confused, when suddenly the Spineosaurus, smelling the urine, comes and battles the raptors. The group makes a dash for the sea, where the Spineosaurus races after them. The army then battles the giant creature.THAT'S an ending!",Jurassic Park III
226,shaid,A waste of money and time,3,16 August 2001,"*SPOILERS*  *SPOILERS*  *SPOILERS*Before I will say something about Jurassic Park III, I would like to say few things about the first 2 movies. Jurassic Park from 1993 was not a very good movie. It was very predictable and you could see in advance who was going to die and who was going to stay alive.In short it was a little boring,(and the book was even worse). And yet it wasn't a total disaster. There is at least one scene that became a classic which everyone copies ever since and it has some idea's which if they were more developed the film would be better. The Lost World: Jurassic Park was a much more entertaining film, largely thanks to the decision to take the T-Rex to the big city. It was done in such a fun and I saw it as a parody to than upcoming Godzilla(and when Godzilla was finally out,it proved to be the worse of the 2 films).So now we reach our current film and there is no good words about it. It is simply a bad movie. I have a theory about JP3. Spielberg didn't want to make it. He didn't think he have anything new to say and he was busy with 2 other,more important, projects(A.I. and Minority Report). Universal studios wanted a third sequel so eventually Spielberg agreed making the film but retain the title of executive producer(which meant that he get some percentage of the profits, but has nothing to say on the film).To show you how bad the film is, here some guiding points for watching it:1. If a child disappears in the first act of the film he will show up later on the film, managing, miraculously, to survive a place where adults are having hard time to survive.2.If the parents of the child are divorced, by the end of the film, they will get back together. The father will prove himself to be worthy of the woman love and admiration. (This is suppose to be and action movie and we get a film which reinforce the value of the American family.Yack!!!).3. If one of the good guys do something bad, that he shouldn't have done he will redeem himself and will get the chance to be only badly wounded instead of getting killed.Beside the written above, the film is a re-hearse of idea's from the first 2 movies. The idea that the dinosaurs are intelligent creatures was use in the first film. The idea that they are very paternal was use in the second one. The second idea is put against the human angel. The dinosaurs are portrait as more caring for their offspring(even the unborn), than the human ones.Joe Johnston, the director, can't handle an action film. He has made all the wrong decisions in directing the film(and it should be mentioned here that Jumanji,one of his previous work,suffered from the same problems)and it looked like he tried to copy someone else instead of trying to be original. The ending of the film, beside been a re-shot of the first film, show a lack of judgment from all people involved. If the flying dinosaurs(and I can't pronounce their name) are so dangerous why even let them leave the island? Only the screenwriters and the producers know.The only 2 good things in the movie, which helped the movie get a 3 out of 10 from me instead the 1 out of 10 it deserved, were the special effects, which should not be surprise and Sam Neill whose dry tone was on the verge of been cynic. A tone which said: ""Yes, I've been there and yes it's a repeat, but I get so much money so why the hell not to do it.""In short. This is film to be avoided. It is waste time and a waste of money. Both should be spent somewhere else.",Jurassic Park III
227,paulo20,Just barely worth watching...but only once ***spoiler warning***,5,23 July 2001,"***spoiler warning***This film, though ridiculous, manages to be entertaining.  The trick is to check your brain at the door and not expect anything but to be entertained. The film just barely manages to do this, so it might be worth your time.Having said that, I still feel compelled to spew my thoughts about this movie and what bothered me about it...Will there never be a good CGI dinosaur movie?  The 1st JP was solid and stands the test of time.  And the characters aren't nearly as annoying as in its sequels; in some respects, they're even likeable. Still, it's not particularly great.  JPII was execrable (although the dinosaurs were still amazing.  Disney's DINOSAUR was similarly awful, with its awful, cloying, talking dinosaurs.  And then there's JPIII...JPIII is better than TLW: JPII, but still displays the same annoying character-types, though III does the audience a favor and gives us less of them, so it gets points there.  The body count is also surprisingly slight at 3, so there's none of the excessive carnage of II.  But anyway, on to the thing that bothers me about this film: basically, it's the fact of all these aggressive dinosaurs.  I can understand the raptors pursuing the humans; they're just the right size and easy to run down.  But what about the Spinosaurus, the upstart to T-Rex (in the franchise, anyway; I don't know where it stands on the evolutionary timeline)?  This thing is absolutely hell-bent on devouring these tiny tidbits that would barely serve as an appetizer.  At one point, it smashes through a thick iron and concrete fence to pursue them.  Either it really, really, hates humans, for some reason, or really likes how they taste, but no creature would expend such a tremendous amount of energy for any good-sized prey animal, let alone such a paltry payoff as a couple of humans (no matter how good they taste).  Especially not when there are large herds of large, meaty, herbivorous dinosaurs everywhere.  They certainly wouldn't risk injury by smashing through a fortified gate.Then there are the Pterodactyls.  These also are tremendously aggressive, viciously attacking the humans as if they're their normal prey.  Not only do these things strike me as being far too vicious, they also seem way too big (and the mechanical models used for close-ups of their faces don't look all that real).If it looks like I'm over-analzying this film, I'm sorry.  I know how that annoys some people.  But if one can't express one's opinion, however trivial, on a forum like this, what can one do?  I also know that this film is geared for nothing but entertainment; a big, loud, comic-book thrill ride.  But is that all this genre is going to be?  Big, loud, toothsome dinosaurs chasing loud, stupid, uninteresting humans?  If so, I'll have to say this is the last ""ride"" for me.By the way, I left one CGI dino movie off the list above and that's the 3-D IMAX film T-Rex: Back to the Cretaceous.  The T-Rex scenes are awesome in that movie but also, unfortunately, very scant, which I'm assuming is because of budget constraints.  Most of the movie deals with a paleontologist and his daughter.  Still, it doesn't have to do with dinos doggedly pursuing people and it's worth watching for the amazing 3-D effect.",Jurassic Park III
228,paulo20,Some more trivial carping,5,23 July 2001,"***WARNING: contains spoilers, over-analysis of film and various geeky dino details***I already commented on this movie, but, having left some things uncommented on, I couldn't resist depositing another 2¢.The Players.  There've been a lot of comments about how much of a thrill ride this movie is, but I'm not so sure...  Isn't it only a thrill if you care at all about any of the characters?  Tea Leoni does what I'd thought impossible: upstage Julianne Moore in the category of Annoying Character.The Plot.  Not much to report there.  It's more like an excuse to get the action going. (I think the ""plot"" is familiar by now to anyone reading up on this movie, so I'll proceed with that in mind) Again, why should we care about anybody stupid enough to send their kid parasailing off the coast of an island teeming with aggressive dinos?  Or mindless enough to shout at full volume right after being attacked by a dino said to be larger than T-Rex (actually just longer).  More dumbness: the man who accompanies the kid onto the island (and saves his life) is reduced to a skeleton and never mentioned again.  Tea Leoni gets entangled with this skeleton and after screaming her fool head off and running off into the jungle still screaming (again, with several carnivorous dinosaurs lurking about) but is otherwise remarkable unbroken up about it, considering it was her boyfriend.  Anyway, the skeleton is nearly picked clean, but the boy's parents are somehow absolutely certain he's alive.  Of course he is, but the fact that he does puts a severe strain on the suspension of disbelief.  How clever and resourceful would he be without leftover supplies such as gas grenades? When asked how he collected a beaker full of T-Rex pee (to scare off other dinosaurs), the boy replies ""You don't want to know.""  Um, actually, I kind of would, but dumb as this movie is, I don't expect an answer.  You're just expected to believe this kid could survive for 8 weeks on a hostile jungle island on nothing more than candy bars.  Right.  Sure.The Spinosaurus.  One reviewer commented about how much cooler it would have been if the Spino fought the T-Rex at the end of the film.  I couldn't agree more.   Actually, I was kind of upset that the T-Rex's neck got snapped I was expecting a rematch between the two and maybe have the Rex save the day (sort of like in the first movie).  Perhaps they could have the Spino chase away the raptors and the T-Rex confront the Spino.  But no.  The ball was dropped and all we got was the the frigging army showing up at the island to save the day (BOOOOOO!  HISSSSS).  Probably the most anti-climactic ending ever seen.  Anyway, this Spino creature is described on the JPIII's very website as being primarily a fish-eater and that its teeth were conical, whereas the T-Rex's teeth had cutting edges. Really, which do you think would win in a fight?  Frankly, I think the T-Rex would reduce the Spino to mincemeat.  T-Rex is still king.",Jurassic Park III
229,Elivx,Underrated Gem!,8,8 October 2020,"After being hugely dissatisfied with The Lost World, I was wishing for the 3rd part to fix the problems of that film. Eventually, it didn't, but it did enough for me to enjoy it. Otherwise, It has stupid characters, a short runtime, hilarious moments and a cheap-look. It became the worst performed film at the franchise box-office.Over 14 years of hate towards the film, it has since started to gain positivity among the franchise fans and critics. Let me address why:1. It returns the charm to the series, since I didn't feel any charm in part 2.2. Part 2 focused more on talking than action. This film features action a lot.3. Sam Neill's return as Alan Grant was a great comeback since his absence in part 2.4. Dinosaurs look cool as ever with the best-looking raptors and Spinosaurus too.5. It had many ways to be a better film, since with the good deleted scenes, which would've made it better.To this day, it has stayed as my 2nd favorite film of the franchise and it definitely deserve some more love over the-boring-ass part 2.",Jurassic Park III

231,clay-8,***1/2 out of ****,8,29 July 2001,"""Jurassic Park 3"" could have been more.  It raises more questions than it has answers for, such as: why did InGen create certain dinosaurs but not document them; or why doesn't the American Embassy help the Kirby's find their son; or how do the characters get so close to the island without getting in trouble with the Costa Rican government?  The answer is simple - If they were answered, there would be no movie.  This picture is as simple as they come, and considering it's so much fun, it makes up for its shortcomings.JP3 is much more visually imaginative than ""The Lost World: Jurassic Park"". Its action scenes are more involving and pleasing.  I'm not going to say the special effects are improved, because, in my opinion, they're on the exact same level as the first two, including one scene (special effect) straight out of 1998's ""Godzilla, but the movie does make better use of them, including a fantastic scene of a pteranodon carrying a boy across canyons. I still can't tell if the boy was CG or the real actor in front of a green screen.  Also, another imaginative scene involves the boy jumping from one rocky pillar to another.  I imagined this stuff while reading the first ""Jurassic Park"", but never saw anything close to it until now.  ""JP3"" is what ""JP2"" - and in some respects, ""JP1"" - should have been.I also have to comment on the fantastic cinematography.  It's the best in the series.  If only it had elaborated on the many questions it asked itself, such as InGen's experiments with the dinos.  I mean, why bring it up anyhow?

232,Ralpho,Worth watching,8,2 August 2020,"I first saw this film in the theater when it came out, in part to get into an air-conditioned space for a couple hours, and enjoyed it immensely (to my surprise).There are plenty of thrilling encounters with dinosaurs, and the film is just 90 minutes long, so you won't be bored by the conversations between dino attacks.Tea Leoni is among my favorite actors, and she does a great job here as a mother looking for her son. Bill Macy is her ex-husband, and he was perfect for the part of a man who pretends to be way more than he is.I only noticed this on the fourth viewing, but when Dr. Grant meets the Kirbys in a restaurant the Randy Newman song ""Big Hat No Cattle"" plays in the background, telegraphing the phoniness of Mr. Kirby.The ""making of"" feature on the DVD is worth watching, too, as it goes into detail about how the dinosaurs were created. To my surprise many of them were real life models controlled remotely. You will also see that much of the jungle island was created on a sound stage. Maybe others can tell the difference, but it seemed real enough to me to be surprised to hear it was a set.So forget the people who hated the film and give it a try.

235,emfern13,Awful,3,7 December 2001,JP3 stinks terribly. It does not compare at all to the first two. Steven Spielberg had the edge to make two brilliant movies about dinosaurs. This guy has made two successful movies and thats it. Steven Spielberg has made more than ten blockbusters. I dont like E.T. but it is a really successful movie.The first Jurassic Park was an excellent movie. Sure parts of it were boring and could have been five minutes shorter but Jp3 could have been half an hour longer. Out of all three the Lost World is one of my all time favorite movies. The action is so much better than the other two. The Trexes are the best in this movie. Sure there is not many Raptor scenes in the movie but the ones that are in it are awesome. Jurassic Park and Lost World are on my top 100 list. JP3 is far from that list. Jp3 has a great beginning. Its exciting and a little creepy but not that scary. I heard that this movie was supposed to be a huge Thriller. I wasn't thrilled by one second of the movie. I think most of the scenes with the spinosaurus were stupid. I did like that boat scene but it was not my favorite. The raptors were stupid in that movie. No scenes with them were good. The pteranodon scenes were awesome. The best in the movie. But just when it starts to get interesting it ends. Leaving it open for a sequel. Which if it is not directed by Steven spielberg i will not be going.,Jurassic Park III

241,tml_pohlak_13,"It's not a movie, it's a travesty!",1,12 March 2009,"Jurassic Park III is the perfect example of how over-zealousness, over-ambition, and a studio's thirst for profit can affect a movie. The trailer made it look like a good, fun movie to watch, when it is, in reality, nothing short of terrible. I'm going to go against my own rules in this review, and mercilessly spoil the movie, because, to be perfectly honest, you'll only waste your time watching it.Hearing that neither Steven Spielberg nor John Williams were returning, an alarm went off in my head. This alarm, however, was quickly stifled when I learned Sam Neill and Laura Dern were reprising their roles as Alan Grant and Ellie Sattler. I should've known better.The plot is flimsy, constructed around one or two memorable scenes from Michael Crichton's novel Jurassic Park that had to be omitted from the original movie (due to budget or time constraint, etc.). All the same, these scenes are (pitifully) the movie's only highlights (but rather poor ones at that). Also, the movie is littered with inaccuracies and plot holes. In the original JP, dinosaur embryos had to be kept at a low temperature (-10°C, according to Crichton's book). JP2 took place four years later; JP3 takes place four years after JP2. So how is it that the dinosaur embryos were perfectly preserved (emphasized in a sweeping shot that is an altogether too-obvious set-up for a Velociraptor attack) despite being stored at far over -10°C for eight years? And that's just the tip of the iceberg.The highlights of the first two movies were the dinosaurs. But all of a sudden, I couldn't care less about the advanced special effects. It doesn't matter how much damage a Spinosaurus can do; if it looks as ridiculously fake as it does here (they went overboard with the special effects), I'm not interested. In addition, the Velociraptor looks like some completely new dinosaur, changing drastically (in just four years? Evolution moves fast!) from its look in the previous two films.I addressed a flimsy plot before. Let me point out that the great big, even more dangerous ""challenge"" that faces the heroes in JPIII is wow. The Velociraptors can communicate. Let me take out my ""watch paint dry"" kit.Whereas the first two films were ingeniously crafted thrillers, JPIII is obviously crafted for quick profits resulting from the franchise's popularity. Apparently, Joe Johnston wanted to do JP2! I'm glad he didn't: I hate his direction style. Scenes that are supposed to thrill or scare are so boring and dumb. As soon as the characters enter a facility where embryos were once kept, I knew they were going to be attacked by a Velociraptor. That's how bad this is.It amuses me to read Roger Ebert's review for the original Jurassic Park, and apply arguments that were inaccurate from his review to JPIII. ""The human characters are a ragtag bunch of half-realized, sketched-in personalities, who exist primarily to scream, utter dire warnings, and outwit the monsters,"" he said about Jurassic Park. Nonsense, I say! Mr. Ebert merely had a vision of what Jurassic Park III was going to be like! Because, really, what do we learn about the characters by the end of JPIII? The ""mercenaries"" all died right away, and all we learned was that one of them filled in for someone who got sick. (How lame!) We learn that some young kid managed to survive on the island for EIGHT WEEKS when the adult who was with him didn't even get the chance to get down from his parachute before dying. And how did he survive? He hid in an abandoned truck With two gas grenades he never used And he was safe in the back of it, too, despite the fact that the Velociraptors now know how to open doors His parents were going through a divorce, but got together because of his disappearance. Yay. We learn mom is a bad driver and dad has a hardware store (who, by the way, can somehow afford to buy four cars in three years; one was an SUV and another was a Buick). And yeah, the main thing they all do is screaming. (If anyone wants, I can still find that paint!) The only word of praise I have is for Sam Neill, who flawlessly reprised his role as Alan Grant. But he couldn't save this movie.Finally, the stupidest move the makers of JPIII did was replacing the T-Rex. We see it in ONE scene, where it is killed by the Spinosaurus. And then it's gone! Apparently, a dinosaur that was non-existent four years ago has magically become king of the dinosaurs. (Another plot hole!) The T-Rex always was and will be the star of Jurassic Park some lame, swimming dinosaur (who apparently swam far enough from the island to kill the crew of a boat that was rather far from shore LAME!) with a sail on its back will never replace Mr. T-Rex.

This is the (very simple and stupid) story of a young boy doing some kind of parachute with a friend of his parents over Isla Sorna (the island where the story of The Lost World happened).  But with some amazing coincidences and unpredictable events (do you feel the sarcasm?), they crash on the island. Then, 8 weeks later (that's a long time to survive, on a near island) the parents pay Alan Grant to come with them save their son on the island. Don't you think the story is stupid? Don't you think this is gratuitous reason to go on an island and get eaten by dinosaurs...This is stupid to the extreme...seriously.  But, not only they have a crap-head scenario, but they also have special effects that are really not as good as the first two's.  I couldn't recognize the raptors, because teh dinosaur models are different and cheaper, and also, the dinosaurs are so fake sometimes, it's evident...the illusion isn't really there.  There are new species of dinosaurs, but the only T-Rex you see lasts only one minute.  But the most stupid point of the film, making it a possible winner at the Razzies fest, is the NEW intelligence of the dinosaurs...they communicate like humans (they don't speak, but it almost sounds like that sometimes), they look at each other, they trap humans...this is awfully stupid...and especially in the dinosaur fight, one of them kills the other by holding his head and breaking his neck...and why don't they eat the humans they kill?  The acting isn't so good, William H Macy is real bad and fake, like Tea Leoni...some awful one-liners, too predictable to be true...really.  The action is so brief, you can't enter into it, there is no stress, no suspense...and the movie has a running time of 85 minutes...plain bad. Overall, stupid story, bad acting, sucky scenario, lame action, no plot, no suspense, just a sell-out under the Jurassic Park title. 2/10",Jurassic Park III
245,RolloTomasi,"Okay, who made the mess?",6,23 July 2001,"It's a week before the premiere of ""Jurassic Park III"" and executives at Universal just watched the finished film. The sentiment is nearly unanimous: 'we brought the film in on time and it looks great! It's a crowd-pleasing hit!' But waaaay in back of the screening room some over-eager intern has her hand raised. ""Excuse me...but like, who is the main character?"" The producer's quick answer would of course be, who cares? We brought the film in ON TIME AND IT LOOKS GREAT. Oh and who are you? Oh who cares, you're fired. This ill-fated intern has a valid concern. Who the heck is the main character in this thing? The closest thing it has to one is Alan Grant (Sam Neill), touted as the only returning character from either of the first two films, even though Laura Dern does make a cameo. But his character is still very under-written. He doesn't drive the plot the way he did the first film. So it's not Grant. Who then? Nobody. Hmmmm, a true ensemble. Well, ""Traffic"" this ain't. Even an action/adventure movie needs a main character and ""JP3"" has none. Having no true protagonist, you wouldn't need an antagonist either. ""JP3"" has several to choose from, but none of them is any more a villain to Dr. Grant and company than the Storm of 1900 was to Galveston. Spinosaurus is hungry and very protective of its territory, likewise with the teradactyls, and the raptors just want their eggs back. I wanted to give Dr. Grant and those mercenaries some advice: The next time you take money to fly to an island full of carnivorous dinosaurs, at least wait for the check to clear! Anyone that money-hungry and naive deserves to die (but not by dinosaur, which would be almost an honorable death). There are probably five people in the world this stupid, but not possibly in the same place.If there were an Academy Award for 'Use of Fog in a Motion Picture', director Joe Johnston would surely win. He uses it magnificently on more than one occasion here. There is no doubt he was tapped by Spielberg to direct this because of his reputation in the field of CG and special effects, which goes back to ""Star Wars."" That's one area ""JP3"" most definitely delivers on. The creators of these dinosaur movies know that's what people are coming to see. In this third film, the effects aren't necessarily better, there's just a whole lot more of them. I still think the dinosaurs looked better in the first two. Spielberg's name is on ""3"", but his touch is most definitely gone. Johnston is more than just an effects guy, he proved that with ""October Sky,"" but he'll need more practice before he has a handle on horror. His own style has its merits and it works for its purposes here, but it's just much different. In a way, these films are thinking persons' horror films, new age monster movies. Spielberg took horror to a new level with ""Jaws,"" then employed some of the same tricks on the original ""Jurassic Park."" The series has changed quite a bit over the years, even changing genres: The original was a horror/sci-fi/adventure story, whereas ""JP3"" is pure action/adventure. There's nothing really profound about it other than residual ethical questions from the first two films. What's really missing is the element of horror that the original, especially, had. Spielberg took a long time with his set-up. The park, the storm, Dennis Nedry, the grandchildren: he twists the rope tighter and tighter--textbook horror--then, when we first get a look at that T-Rex, he releases it. No one was disappointed. Then: the raptors! The whole thing was executed with surgical precision and there will never be anything like it. JP3 can't boast of anything like that kind of structure. Like the original, it hits you with new species in waves, only to revisit them over and over. The script doesn't know exactly what it wants to say, nor is it sure what story it's telling (nor who's). The story is troubled in many areas, the result of this being a combination of the best parts of at least three writers' script drafts. A film like this goes through so many changes during production, the script disappears. You just look at the footage you have and do the best you can. I'm guessing JP3 was really written in the editing room. Holes in the script? That would be easy to say if there actually were one. How do you point the finger at the writer when one person didn't write it? I feel sorry for the WGA people who had to decide who would end up getting credit for it (but more sorry for the writers themselves, whos work is only evident in pieces strewn here and there in the film). Blame the editor? Well, no, Robert Dalva (the guy credited with the editing) did the best he could.The actors? They too are just doing their jobs. So now everyone's head is turned to Mr. Johnston. Well, like Billy, Alessandro Nivola's character, he had only the best intentions at heart (and look at what happened to Billy). ""JP3"" ended up being this big, beautiful mess of a movie with no one to point the finger of blame at for its defects, and no one to really take credit for its merits. To give it a grade, I fall back on the one true barometer there is for a film like this: did I have a good time at it or not? Yes, I did. But who do I thank?Grade: C+",Jurassic Park III
246,Mario64,Better than a lot this summer.,6,8 August 2001,"This movie is better than a lot that I have seen this summer. That isn't to say a lot with dissapointments like Tomb Raider, Pearl Harbor and the Fast and the Furious. This movie certainly isn't up to the potential of the orgional Jurassic Park but it certainly is more fun and exciting that the Lost World. I liked the flow of this movie, it was short but it moved well dedicating different times for different dinosaurs. The Spinosaurus and the Raptors were effective but my favorite were the Terenadons (flying dinosaurs). The minuses in this movie can be described in one word, stupidity. Yeah the dinosaurs are smarter now, apparently even smarter than the humans, at least in this movie. I probably won't watch this movie again but it works at an alright level as a fun summer movie. I give it a 6 out of 10.",Jurassic Park III
247,Sic Coyote,Exciting horror film!,7,16 July 2001,"How did this film get by with a PG rating?! It's really gruesome in some points, there is even more action and scares than before! It's quite like a slasher film in the way it's made up but instead of a knife wielding maniac after you it's all sorts of creatures! See this film for yourselves it's great! I thought it was going to be totally pants because where could they go with it? Well I think it goes just in the right direction. It's a tour-de-force of action with the small bits in between to help with the story development. It had me curling up inside with tension! The beginning I accept was a little slow but then so was The Lost World when it was setting up the actual going to the island but as soon as they are there the action is full on! Sure it may not be totally intellectually stimulating but who cares!? It's a horror movie that some how has a kids rating and I'm sure will give many prepubescent nightmares for years to come. Good one! 8/10",Jurassic Park III
248,jiangliqings,"In a summer of sequels, this was probably the best.",6,13 May 2002,"*** out of ****As you can probably guess on your own, a third film in a series about big dinosaurs chasing after measly, little humans is probably going to wear itself thin in terms of plot, and let's face it, Jurassic Park III doesn't have much story.  But let's be honest, do we really care?  All I ask for my hard-earned money is a competently made thrill ride that features big dinosaurs chasing after measly, little humans.  And on that level, JPIII is a pretty damn good success.  Certainly, this series is turning out better than the Jaws franchise.In this third-go-round, Sam Neill returns as Dr. Alan Grant, the now-world famous paleontologist who's having trouble coming up with grant money thanks to the fact that everybody in the world knows real dinosaurs exist.  Thus, Grant is a bit easily goaded when a couple (William H. Macy and Tea Leoni) offer to pay big bucks for him to give them a little tour guide of the dino island.  Reluctantly agreeing, Grant brings along his protege, Billy (Alessandro Nivola), and they all head off to Isla Sorna.Not all goes according to plan, once Grant finds out the couple is really searching for their son, who was stranded six weeks ago.  Then there's that slight complication when this really big dinosaur called the Spinosaurus rips apart the airplane the group arrived in.  Afterward, there are only five survivors, and they set out to look for the missing boy and a way off the island.Plot-wise, it would probably be easier to simply state that a bunch of people get stuck on an island with man-eating dinosaurs.  After all, thrills would be the only reason anybody would watch this kind of movie in the first place, yet I find it funny I keep hearing complaints about bad story-telling and little characterization.  Really, the general movie-going public has got to re-evaulate their expectations a little more if they don't know what to expect out of a movie called Jurassic Park III.  Things such as story-telling and character development mean little to a movie about dinosaurs, much less a third film about said dinosaurs in a series, but those elements are adequate enough for the thrill-ride experience to work.Directed by Joe Johnston, this movie still often has the look and feel of a Spielberg film.  There's a bit of sentimentality here and there (as opposed to almost zero in the The Lost World), particularly in the beginning, with the scenes between Neill and Laura Dern (these moments work quite well), and later on in the film, between the estranged couple, played by Macy and a very annoying Leoni, and their son (these moments don't work so well). It's these scenes that lead me to question how so many people can proclaim this one superior to the original because of no sentimentality when it clearly has some.  Really, what I learned from such statements is that some people out there are just desperate to come up with something to bad mouth Spielberg.Johnston is not quite as good an action director as Spielberg.  By that, I mean there's not as much build-up to the attack scenes, nor is there really that much suspense, especially when compared to the nail-biting finale in the original and the trailer park scene in the The Lost World.  Johnston gets to the action quickly, almost as if though he were afraid he'd lose our attention otherwise.  It feels a little sloppy at times, but at least it eventually builds into that thrill-ride experience.The excitement delivered in spades, thanks to moments such as a nice little drag-down knockout fight between the Spinosaurus and the T-Rex.  The guy I was rooting for didn't win, but it was still a damn good fight.  The raptors are sorely underused here, and there were a lot of possibilities Johnston could have come up with, especially set inside that village.  But, unfortunately, he abandons the enclosed setting (which really could have led to a lot of great thrills) and sticks to the jungle.Mind you, the jungle is still set up for quite a bit of fun.  The Spinosaurus makes several more appearances, one of them telegraphed by an amusing riff off Jaws and Peter Pan.  The pteranadons are put to good use here, with a sequence set inside a cage that's fairly exciting.  Sure, that ""evil stare"" that one pteranadon gives is pretty unintentionally hilarious, but stuff like that is appreciated in a B-movie.Speaking of B-movie, this one's a little more obvious of its roots than its predecessors, which is a plus.  JPIII has a pretty good sense of humor, as shown during a laugh-out loud dream scene that mocks the series itself. William H. Macy also gets in quite a few good laughs, a lot of them at the expense of the character himself!Special effects are what we would expect, meaning they're mostly excellent, with the only real complaint being that some of the dinos seem a little too CGI and the Spinosaurus' animatronic origins are far too obvious.  Mild complaints, though, considering the effects are really very impressive.Acting's also decent, with Neill, Macy, and Nivola registering positively. Michael Jeter's actually pretty likeable as a ""mercenary"" and Trevor Morgan is a kid who doesn't save the day or act as comic relief, thank God. However, Tea Leoni's just annoying, as she just about always is.  I can't quite put my finger on what it is about her that irritates me so; perhaps it's her speech pattern, or maybe just her general lack of acting ability.Don Davis' score is noticeably John Williams-ish.  The jungle drums from The Lost World are replaced by a more traditional action/adventure theme, which is effective enough if nothing spectacular.  The original movie's main theme is present, too, though for some odd reason, it felt oddly inappropriate to me.  I guess I was just hoping for more of the dark tone and atmosphere the second film gave us, and that musical theme from Williams (which is great, I'm not trying to knock it) sounds way too bright in tone and awe-inspiring to punch that feeling home.Where Jurassic Park III really stumbles is the ending, which is incredibly abrupt and lacking a bit in basic logic.  I'd go a little further, but I might spoil things somewhat, suffice to say that judging from what I saw, raptors don't really have very good auditory perception and we'll just leave it at that.Given that this is a third movie in a series known primarily for its action/special effects, I'd say Jurassic Park III rates quite highly as an entertaining action/horror excursion.  Perhaps not quite as intense as its predecessors, it still works considerably well, and it's story doesn't quite have as many idiocies as The Lost World, as it is known infamously for. JPIII was also probably the best sequel in a summer chock full of them. The Mummy Returns was a colossal disappointment, Rush Hour 2 pretty much repeated most of the same mistakes of Rush Hour, and American Pie 2 is...the sequel to the already dreaded American Pie.  Anyway, JPIII's good fun, and I guess it says something positive when I actually don't mind the prospect of another sequel.",Jurassic Park III
249,Eamonn_green,The worst Jurassic Park but that is not a bad thing,8,12 February 2002,"CONTAINS SPOILERS This is the worse Jurassic Park film. That definitely not mean it's a bad film. If you were hoping for this to be the best Jurassic Park well you hoped for too much.Others thought it was brilliant! Come on! It is a sequel but not a ""follow up"". That is a bad thing about the storyline. The lost world is my favourite film because it continued on from Jurassic Park, this film has nothing to do with The lost world!Where did the Spinosaurus (the dino with thing on its back) turn up from? Did just magically appear? How come we didn't see it in other films?Oh and when that T-rex was killed by the Spinosaurus, would the mate of the T-rex not have killed the Spinosaurus? In the lost world the T-rex went after Sarah and Nick for taking the baby T-rex.I should stop bad mouthing the best film of 2001. Any LOTR fans wanna argue? This was the best film this year!The special effects were good at parts and terrible at others. One of the good parts was when the Pteranadons (flying reptiles) attacked Billy. They looked real! The Spinosaurus well, you could make something more real looking in Paint!Oh and it never explained what happened to Billy between getting attacked and ending up at the coast!This is a good film and the action was great but a different predator for JP 4. Please!!!!! The Spinosaurus was crap, how about a Giganothosaurus(biggest carnivorous dino) or T-rex?Another thing how could the Spinosaurus break down a fence but not 2 smaller doors?This is the greatest film of 2001 and I'm hoping Joe Johnston doesn't make 4 but another by Speilberg would be welcomed by me. 8 out of 10",Jurassic Park III
250,Denver53,It's short. It has dinosaurs. What did you expect?,6,23 July 2001,"JPIII is, well, more dinosaur chomping. The people are cardboard cutouts and the story is shallow. Even the chomping is mostly the dinosaur-leaps-out-from-the-side type, vs. the dinosaurs-are-stalking-humans technique (the latter I find more suspenseful).But hey, you want to see what real, live dinosaurs might have looked like and moved like? JPIII is your ticket. And thankfully, it does NOT do the stupidest thing JP:The Lost World did by bring a dinosaur to ""civilization.""This movie could have been improved if it had used more of the kid in the jungle story. It might have been better, too, if there were more new dinos (OK, the petrodactyls were interesting, but the spinosaurus was more of the same). I think it blew a chance to really give a sense of awe to the audience in a scene where giant aptosaurs come to a river where humans are on a boat and peer down. Just when you get to the point where the sheer size of the dinos would have been stunning, the scene cuts away (because, after all, these are herbivors, and don't eat people). And is it just me, or did the feared 'raptors get smaller?Anyway, we gave JPIII a 6. I'm sure there will be a JP:IV.

252,Funky A,"That's it, no more cheap sequels please!!!",3,12 August 2001,"I don't know which of the two sequels to the very good Jurassic Park is the weakest, but they are both bad in their own special way... While the second one was incredibly long, stupid and even had the guts to end the movie on an terribly cheesy ""dino in the city"" sequence, this third movie in the franchise is a completely illogical and very boring movie. The good part of it is it is so short, you don't suffer as long as during the second one. And no dinosaur ends up in a city this time. But this movie is the kind of sequel which, to make any sense to a human being, requires the viewer to have such a bad memory that he doesn't ask why, oh why some dinosaurs have changed so much since the first two movies. I am of course talking about the stupid raptors which, while they had been terrifying in the first one, have becomes ridiculous. Why are some raptors growing mohawks? Is there a punk trend on this island? Since when do these animals communicate so well between each other? And most important of all (SPOILER WARNING, although spoiling something so stupid isn't exactly spoiling, isn't it)why do these fierce and violent creature now seem pretty nice in their own prehistoric way, since they now forgive people who steal their eggs?(END OF SPOILER, although you must agree that there wasn't much to spoil since it is stupid anyway...). Apart from that, what could I say. I always preffered Jeff Goldblum's Ian Malcolm to to Sam Neill's Doctor Grant, so that makes a few points to add to the weak score The Lost World has... Still, since there is no dinosaur in the city, Jurassic Park 3 gains a few points on that. Anyway, both movies are awful so let's make this a tie match in this clash of the bad movies.

253,badoli,This is a stupid movie.,3,11 April 2010,"As it neither can count on the innovation-factor of the first title nor the success-couple Spielberg/Crichton, it has to prove as a passable action movie. And fails.The characters behave hilariously and laughable throughout this movie. People run around screaming and shouting (sometimes even with a megaphone) through a supposedly Dino-filled island, yet the Dino's only once in a while seem to be willing listen. My guess is they were scared by the terrible characterizations and the bad acting.But then again, the actual heroes of the movie are the dinosaurs. Yes, we see more of them, at least more variation. Finally the biggest land-living carnivore makes his appearance. So what? He doesn't even manage to snack a handful people, which is embarrassing in connection with the ludicrous actions of the humans. And taken that the main plot is about a boy living for several weeks under those creatures, i salute to the director/writers for making the Dino's look this stupid (beside the obvious aliens-ripoff-idea).The movie simply jumps around between stereotypical ""oh it's so close i don't think they'll make it""-action-scenes, ""oh my god, this is an abomination of nature""-Sam Neil and long and boring character scenes without ever making anything look interesting.

255,Mike Astill,Great fun,7,2 August 2001,"There were two things I want from Jurassic Park sequels. The first is to see the dinos stomping through a city, and although this did happen in The Lost World, it felt tacked-on and cheesy. The other thing I wanted to see was a knock-down, stand-up fight between two really BIG dinos, like you used to see in the old classic Ray Harryhausen films. Well, I'm still waiting for the dinos to invade the big city, but the T-Rex vs Spinosaurus face-off near the beginning of Jurassic Park 3 made me a happy man. Just a shame there was no grudge rematch at the end to close things off a bit better, because as it stands this third film seems to do little except line up a fourth.Not that you'll hear me complaining too hard about that. With each film the effects get better, the dinosaurs more realistic (and more prolific), and  bizarrely  the humans get dumber. Sure, the plots of the two sequels both stink, but that's the nature of sequels and, provided we're fed some great action and FX, that suits me fine. That's what these films are about, after all. if you want a treatise on the dangers of genetic tampering, read the books instead. At least with this second sequel, the plot' has been kept deliberately threadbare, letting the film flow from one action scene to another, unlike the ponderous pace of The Lost World.I couldn't hear most of the exposition at the beginning of the film due to all the kids chattering in the theatre. They just wanted to see the dinos, and so did I. Thankfully, character development is kept to a minimum, and we're thrust back onto Site B in no time. In a throwback to the original book, we get Pteranodons this time round (the technology and budget obviously stretches to flying dinos now), and this section of the film is inventive and exciting, and well-handled. There's less blood and gore this time round, and quite a bit more sly humour, and the welcome return of Sam Neil, reprising his role as palaeontologist Alan Grant. It's a shame Laura Dern was present only as a cameo. All told, this is a fun way to pass an hour and a half, and anyone not too jaded after seeing the first two should lap it up.",Jurassic Park III
256,KillerLord,Repetitive and Monotonic!,6,8 October 2008,"The first movie in the Jurassic Park series was very special because it was the first one. The second movie was shallow in the sense that there was no plot and story or anything special to look for. But the second movie still had a Spielberg magic to it and it was possible for us to overcome the monotone that sets in the second movie. Even though the story line and the progression of the movie was predictable in the second series, it still was a very well handled movie. But the third part fails miserably to do anything good. The third installment had nothing new to offer. A typical case of the same story with a different setting! This time Sam Neill's character has been tricked into going onto the dreaded island. From the very start the whole idea of losing a son on the forbidden island and then tricking a scientist into helping them is absurd on the face of it. We are given a dysfunctional couple and a very weird idea they use in order to get them a guided tour of the island. There is not such a great breakthrough in the graphics. They remain decent though they seem cartoon like on certain occasions. New types of dinosaurs have been introduced and there origin has been explained away in a rather unbelievable manner. We have all of a sudden coordination skills and intelligence being bestowed upon the dinosaurs. They have been raised to status of being almost like humans! There is a point where Sam Neill surrenders the stolen egg to the dinosaurs and they go away with satisfaction and assurance. They clearly are shown to communicate, coordinate and camouflage. One wonders how such intelligence arises. As such, the story line is very poor and the overall direction is not so great. But that still does not mean that the movie is completely worthless. The movie still can be considered as a good watch. But it lacks the magic of the first movie and it definitely lacks the Spielberg touch of both first and second movies.",Jurassic Park III
257,Tyson14,A disgrace to the Jurassic park franchise,1,13 June 2015,"What happens when you put a group of second-rate filmmakers together on an island, give them an enormous budget, and provide them with one of the most valuable film franchises of all time? You realise just how brilliant Steven Spielberg is.""Jurassic Park III"" is simply a pointless movie that never should have been made. The film simply reeks of a cheap sequel. The basic plot tells of a couple who tricks Dr. Alan Grant to take them into Jurassic Park after their son is lost on the island while parasailing. Predictably, all hell breaks loose as the dinosaurs continue to wreak havoc. Unfortunately, in all of this havoc there is not a single moment of decent dialogue, acting, directing, or special effects. The filmmakers seem to have interpreted the original ""Jurassic Park"" as a horror film, and treat this movie as such. Characters die in a timely and organised fashion, characters attempt to separate in order to be ""more effective,"" and so forth. The original ""Jurassic Park"" was not a horror film, and this movie should not have been treated as such.I doubt that many people had high expectations for ""Jurassic Park III"" as a good film. Most probably thought the movie would simply be an enjoyable escape for an hour and a half with great special effects and a few memorable scenes. Yet somehow, even with a budget of approximately ninety million dollars, the movie's special effects were terrible. In the opening scene, I heard a kid behind me who couldn't have been older than eight turn to his mom and say ""Mommy, that looks so fake."" If the special effects couldn't even make a child believe, how are they supposed to convince the rest of the public? Another huge weakness in this movie is the timing. One thing that made the original ""Jurassic Park"" great was the memorable scenes. I can instantly recall great scenes from the movie, such as the T-Rex chasing the Jeep at night, the young boy climbing the electric fence and getting electrocuted, and so forth. ""Jurassic Park III"" doesn't have any sense of timing, and as a result the film just feels like a bunch of scenes that bleed into each other without any rhyme or reason. A few moments in the movie could have actually been memorable scenes had they been timed correctly, but instead they are easily discarded and thought of as a joke. The lack of special effects and memorable scenes kills the possibility of ""Jurassic Park III"" even being an enjoyable excursion.Yet through all the bad acting, poor writing, and mindless directing, the biggest weakness in the film is not as obvious. The filmmakers failed to realise what the original ""Jurassic Park"" was about. It was not simply a horror or action film in which the protagonists ran away from scary beasts. The film was an examination of man's role in nature and of how we view ourselves as the mighty rulers of the universe. While there were exciting chase scenes and great special effects, those were not the theme of the film. ""Jurassic Park III"" forgets all of this, and even occasionally mocks these themes in the original. If you took these themes away from the original film, all you would have had left would be a hollow horror film with great special effects. ""Jurassic Park III"" is simply a hollow horror film with mediocre special effects. ""Jurassic Park"" is a story about man; ""Jurassic Park III"" is a story about dinosaurs. That is the primary difference between the two films.One would have thought that with the budget and the resources the filmmakers had, they could have produced a better movie than ""Jurassic Park III."" Instead, the movie is a reminder of ""Jaws,"" another amazing Spielberg film that had sequels made by different directors that were subsequently mindless waste. While ""Jurassic Park II"" was not a great film by any means, it at least understood the original and tried to carry on it's themes. ""Jurassic Park III"" does none of that, and as a result is simply rubbish that should definitely be avoided.",Jurassic Park III
258,Phillemos,Wow! Spinosaurus!!!,5,3 September 2006,"I had no idea Spinosaurus was such a bad-a** until I saw this movie. In fact, this movie puts Spinosaurus on the map. Until ""Jurassic Park III"" Spinosaurus was just one of those run-of-the-mill big meat-eating dinosaurs, who happened to have some funky-looking spines on his back but otherwise wasn't too impressive. Now fast-forward to the beginning of ""JP-III,"" where he shreds some poor pilot guy who was lost in the forest, then bundles a Tyrannosaurus rex who challenges him over some table scraps (ultimately killing the T-rex). I'd like to see a best-of-seven playoff series between these two predators, because I still think T-rex would have held his own more often than not, what with his bigger, more massive jaws and all. If fact, that's what this movie really should be about. Unfortunately, the rest of this movie is a little too contrived, far-fetched and boring. Some little kid gets lost on the island and Sam Neill is roped into going back on the island to save him. Personally, I couldn't care less about the kid. Tea Leoni was fun to look at, so when the movie got boring I prayed for more Tea Leoni shots. Clearly this is the worst of the trilogy (I've heard a fourth installment is due in 2008, which would certainly pique my interest). However, I give it a 5 because it's still pretty lively and I feel like it has to receive a better score than the third movie of the ""Carnosaur"" trilogy just on principle.",Jurassic Park III

I don't buy it--the main character, Dr. Grant (Sam Elliott) is portrayed as anti-park.  He loves his dinosaurs the old-fashioned way--digging them out of stone.Now, mind you, he's seen the past come alive in a previous encounter where he was thrashed by a T-rex and ravaged by raptors.  Nevertheless, he got a closer look at the beasties than anyone else.But now, with dino activity rumored on a nearby island, we are to believe that the old fossil hound doesn't want to get a peek at the real thing. Especially in light of his raptor theory--they could have become the dominant species on Earth if not for that pesky asteroid that brought the curtain down on the dino era 65 million years ago.Here's the revised version for JPIII:  Grant's in a funk, bolting out of dino dreams, getting all hot and sweaty about it.  He realizes his worst fear: he has to go back--to test his theories, to see what makes a pterasaur sore.So he recruits some old friends(like Laura Dern who could have phoned in her part this time around) and gets dropped on the island.  Bad things happen right away and he gets that old feeling again--that while dinosaurs may be cool, they aren't very nice.But this time, old Grantie has to rescue Laura who's been snagged by a band of female-loving raptors--that aspect is touched on towards the end of JP3 with the main raptor giving a nudge to Tea Leoni(rather than taking her head off).Now this would have used the same basic components of III--dino effects, cell phone in the crap scene, etc.  But no kids, no dumb husband-and-wife stuff, no preaching.As for the actual movie--some good scenes but you're never really transported to the island to shake in terror as these computer-enhanced monsters.",Jurassic Park III
260,MadReviewer,One Simple Word: Horrible,3,23 July 2001,"`Jurassic Park III' is bad.  Very bad.  So bad, in fact, that there's little, if anything, that can be salvaged out of this rancid film that could remotely be considered good.  Sure, it'll make its money . . . in fact, it'll probably make enough to ensure a `JP4' (shudder) . . . but if you're considering going to see this movie, I'd strongly advise you not to go.  In fact, I'll beg you not to go.  Please.  This is easily one of the worst films released in 2001.  The ill-advised plot of `JP3' is as follows:  Doctor Alan Grant (Sam Neill), desperate for funding on a dinosaur dig, accepts a strange offer from a wealthy couple, Paul and Amanda Kirby (William H. Macy and Tea Leoni) - take them on an aerial tour of the original Jurassic Park island, and receive unlimited funding for his research efforts.  Since he only expects to have to fly over the island, he's abruptly surprised when his plane actually lands on the island.  It turns out that the couple's fourteen-year old son Eric (Trevor Morgan) is lost somewhere on the island, and they need to find and rescue their precious child.  Of course, the plane gets wasted by dinosaurs shortly after touchdown, so now Dr. Grant, the Kirbys, and the rest of the plane's crew must fight for survival as they find themselves being hunted by the ravenous dinosaurs, who, according to Dr. Grant, may be smarter than most scientists ever thought possible . ..On paper, this might have seemed like a good idea, but on screen, it's utterly preposterous and stupid.  The story is so thin, it's almost embarrassing.  Every line uttered in this film is essential to moving along the main plot.  It sounds like the actors were given Cliff's Notes instead of a script.  While there's something to be said for economy in dialogue, `JP3' pushed it to the point of being ridiculous.  (The line `Did you hear something?' - which must have been uttered at least five times during this film - is apparently code for `A dinosaur will be jumping out of the shadows in the next ten seconds.')  There's no real reason given to care about anyone in this film; the fact that they're trapped with vicious dinosaurs is apparently supposed to be reason enough.  Since the characters are stupid enough to bring most of their miseries upon themselves, though, it's difficult to feel sorry for them.The behavior of the characters is ludicrous.  `Jurassic Park Island' is apparently infamous for being filled with vicious, man-eating dinosaurs - so, what does Amanda (Tea Leoni) do the instant the plane lands on the island?  She goes stomping into the wilderness - away from the rest of the group - armed with ONLY A BULLHORN, SCREAMING HER SON'S NAME AND SIGNALLING EVERY DINOSAUR ON THE ISLAND THAT A HUMAN SNACK HAS ARRIVED!!! There's at least two dozen other examples of this scattered throughout the film, examples of pure, abject stupidity on the part of the characters.  Dr. Grant keeps muttering at various points during the movie (just in case the audience missed it the first six thousand times it gets mentioned) that the dinosaurs must be smart . . . well, yes and no, Dr Grant.  The dinosaurs in this film are indeed relatively smart in comparison to the humans in this film, but only because the humans are such thick-skulled dimwits. Brain-damaged field mice would be considered smart in comparison to the humans in this film.Even in terms of just being a fun, dumb movie, `JP3' fails appallingly . . . all thanks to director Joe Johnston.  It's hard to imagine that somebody with a big budget and ILM-created dinosaurs could possibly make a boring movie . . . but Joe Johnston does just that.  Flat, dull, and unimaginative describe the action scenes involving the dinosaurs in `JP3'.  (And the scenes without the dinosaurs are pure Sominex.)  Dinosaurs pretty much just waltz into the appropriate scenes and start attacking people - there's virtually no attempt to build tension or to try to deliver maximum tension or impact with the creatures.  It's as though the audience is supposed to just sit back and marvel at how impressive-looking the dinosaurs are, and that should be exciting enough . . . here's a newsflash, Mr. Johnston.  It's not.   For a big budget, special effects-laden film, this is possibly one of the least visually impressive movies ever made.I genuinely feel sorry for Sam Neill and William H. Macy - on screen, they almost look apologetic for the terrible lines they have to deliver.  They try to put in some good performances, and they must be given credit for trying . . . but considering the garbage they're working with, it's no surprise that they can't pull it off.  As for Tea Leoni . . . good gravy, who told her she could act?  Every line she utters is pure crap - hammy, unbelievable, and delivered with such uncertainty, I became convinced she was reading off of a badly shaking TelePrompter.  I've seen worse performances . . . but they're usually in `direct to video' releases.  Did nobody else audition for this part?  Horrendous.`Jurassic Park' and `The Lost World' weren't exactly great films, but they were fun and entertaining, and possessed a certain sense of wonder and fear that made them worth watching.  `JP3' possesses none of the above positive criteria.  It does, however, possess the ability to inspire loathing and nausea from its abysmal direction and pitifully sparse, rotten screenplay. To put it mildly, `JP3' stinks like an overflowing port-o-john.  The movie's a bad, bad joke. Grade: D-",Jurassic Park III
261,Blazehgehg,Not bad; but ultimately pointless,6,18 August 2005,"The first time I saw Jurassic Park 3, I honestly thought it was fine. It wasn't an outstanding movie, but it wasn't terrible. After how weird and clumsy the second Jurassic Park movie could be, Jurassic Park 3 was... acceptable. An average excuse to revisit the world of a theme park full of dinosaurs.As the years wore on, and I'd catch bits and pieces of Jurassic Park 3 on TV, every time I'd see it, the movie seemed to get worse. Dumber, actually. The more I thought about its premise, its characters, the less I began to like it.At its core, this movie is Jurassic Park: The Template. You bring back characters from the first movie, send them back to Jurassic Park, open with a sense of wonderment that then devolves in to the horror of coexisting with these fearsome, extinct animals in a bid to escape with your life. The problem is, Jurassic Park 3 has absolutely no reverence for any of this. Parts of this movie have a really depressing ""yeah, whatever, dinosaurs I guess"" tone to it. It feels bored with itself, sometimes.Characterization is weird. This movie is full of ""don't do that!"" horror movie logic, where people defy common sense for the sake of giving our characters something to do and a reason to run from the monsters. The weird thing is, this is presented as a charming character trait -- something meant to endear us to these idiots in their quest to rescue their son from a vacation gone awry.These people aren't just stupid, but they're malicious about it, too. They kidnap Alan Grant and force him to go back, hoping to use his expertise in the matter in the hunt for their son. A number of the rescue party die because of this, but once again, Jurassic Park 3 goes out of its way to portray this kid's parents as cute, innocent middle-Americans who are just trying to ""do the right thing."" The blood of multiple lost lives is on their hands, and whereas other Jurassic Park movies usually dwell on the cost of human life, JP3 shrugs its shoulders as if to say, ""You knew these people were going to die anyway, so it's okay if nobody cares when they're gone.""There are really only two things JP3 is interested in:One, introducing a Newer, Bigger, Cooler Dinosaur that summarily kills a Tyrannosaurus Rex in the first act so you know how much Bigger and Cooler it is. This is a somewhat transparent bid so kids would buy merchandise of the new dinosaur. Within the story, there is functionally no difference between a T-Rex and the new Spinosaurus. Nothing is really revealed about their personality, abilities, intelligence, or anything to make them stand out. The difference is purely visual. Open your wallets.Two, JP3 pays more lip service to Velociraptors being the only other notable dinosaur in this franchise. When our characters aren't running from Spinosaurus, they're running from Raptors. There's at least a little more depth here -- we're shown that Raptors are even smarter than we might have given them credit for, and we're told if it wasn't for the extinction-level event that wiped out their kind, they may have evolved to become the dominant species on this planet. It can be more than a little ham-fisted, and things get even more schlocky later on when the movie dares show us more of the inner-workings of the Velociraptor social structure. Definitely embarrassing at times, but still not quite as bad as the gymnastics goof from the second Jurassic Park.The one small mercy provided by this movie is that it's not very long. At just barely 90 minutes, it gets in, shows you some dinosaurs, and gets out. But don't count on it leaving very many positive or lasting memories.",Jurassic Park III
262,nathanjamesemerson,Welcome back to Jur... I mean Isla Sorna,8,24 September 2018,"I will admit that I am in the minority who enjoyed this film more then the first sequel The Lost World.The movie goes by at a quick pace and there is not much time for things to slow down. Which is good for a movie. The storyline could have been much better, and some characters less annoying. Tea Leoni's character was incredibly annoying as was the child actor. But everyone ever played there roles perfectly. Especially Sam Neil and Laura Dern (who made a cameo).The movie was fun from start to finish. You just have to ignore some of the plot holes. Such as the Spinosaurus being on the island. The previous movie was set on the same island and there was no sign of the Spinosaurus. Granted the third movie was not written at that time. But there is not really any explanation why the Spinosaurus is there in this film. Just as there is no explanation as to why you don't see any of the same locations from the second film. The island is big yes, but it's not that big.Putting all that aside, the movie is fun and exciting. It is not as long as the rest of the movies in the series but it is still an amazing ride featuring some amazing special effects and dinosaur action",Jurassic Park III
263,thehardyboyz2043,The problems continue,3,19 July 2001,"(A possible minor spoiler) The first ""Jurassic Park"" was an effective, but silly film that did it's job and was actually pretty good. The sequel ""The Lost World"" had a few decent moments, but those were ruined by the lame end portion of the film which had a T-Rex running amok in San Diego.   Now in ""Jurassic Park III,"" what little story there was in the first one and the sequel, has been thrown out the window and replaced by a mere 90 minutes of basically non-stop action, which would have worked had the film not been so poorly done.Sam Neill is back as Dr. Grant, who is given a proposition by a couple (William H. Macy & Tea Leoni) to come with them to an island to help them find their son, who's been lost for over 2 months. But of course this island just happens to be populated by dinosaurs and of course the plane the are on just happens to crash leaving them stranded with a bunch of dinos after them.This one was obviously intended as a thrill ride, with no real story whatsoever, but even on that level the movie doesn't deliver. Director Joe Johnston (""Jumanji"") somehow managed to take what little magic was left in the ""Jurassic"" movies and squeeze the life right out of it. The dinos look okay, though by now they're just standard fair and not very scary. The bottom line is it's not a very good film, even as a thrill ride. * out of 4 stars.",Jurassic Park III
264,roystephen-81252,"Fun, as it should be",8,12 February 2016,"After the slightly (or not so slightly) disappointing first sequel (Lost World), I thoroughly enjoyed this Jurassic flick. Its greatest virtue is that it does not want to bite more than it can chew. It's just another monster chase movie, 'running and screaming' with goofy jokes and lots of teeth, but if you're up for that, it is one hell of a ride.The cast is great (minus Téa Leoni who often gets somewhat irritating here), the story, however simple, makes sense (OK, 15 years ago it wasn't such a rarity as nowadays), and the visuals are of top quality, as expected. We get new monsters, and exciting, well-choreographed, memorable action scenes. (T.Rex vs. Spinosaurus. Flying dinosaurs. Even smarter Velociraptors. What's not to like?)The movie is short and sweet. 90 minutes, that's all. 90 minutes of relentless, uninterrupted fun. Just like a good, escapist, endlessly rewatchable Sunday flick should be.And you'll never forget that ring-tone.",Jurassic Park III
265,Jsimpson5,An unneeded sequel,4,5 May 2008,"A good number of films have sequels. Most of the time the sequels are not as good as the first film. There are a few exceptions to this rule as well. Films sequels in my opinion fall into at least one of the following three groups, sequels that are not good, sequels that are good, and sequels that should not have been made. This film falls into both the first and three groups.The basic gist of the film is that some people want to go Site ""B"" and see the dinosaurs. They get there and things go from dumb to worse.I didn't like this film that much at all. The characters just don't seem like real people, they were not 2-d characters, and they are not 3-d characters, but sorta 2.5-d characters. They change some, but not much to seem like they should.I also wasn't impressed with the CGI effects. The effects didn't seem realistic at times. The other problem I had with the film was the length of the film. The whole film seemed rushed and there was not much character development at all, which is important for any films, especially the Jurassic Park films.This film is sorta like the many Friday the 13th films. Not good and not needed. If you enjoyed the first two Jurassic Park films then ignore this one, it's not worth it.",Jurassic Park III
266,Rhino Rover,Not quite the same.,7,14 August 2001,"You know I was a bit surprised that Steven Spielberg didn't direct this installment of Jurassic Park. I thought that this series was his little pet project (no pun intended) and that he would have liked to have been heavily involved in the making and direction of all of them. Having said that I wasn't disappointed with what I saw but it definitely lacked the `Spielberg' feel. I guess in a way making sequels becomes infinitely harder to do as the surprise element is gone and it's especially true of the Jurassic Park series. Prior to the first movie, no had ever seen a dinosaur on screen so realistically portrayed and that element created a buzz. The subsequent movies had that `been there, done that' feel so where do you go from there? In this case (and Lost World) it means more dinosaurs, more gruesome scenes and more running, which isn't bad as long as you're not expecting anything more. This installment brings back Alan Grant (Sam Neil) with a bit of a cameo from Laura Dern. Other than that, the rest of the cast is basically new. The movie revolves around Grant being persuaded (promise of huge funding for his digs) by a couple to be their `dinosaur expert' on an alleged vacation fly-by of Isla Sorna (the island from the Lost World). Reluctantly Grant complies, mostly for monetary reasons, and he goes on this supposed fly-by with his research aid. Little does he know, the couple (played by Tea Leoni and William H. Macy) have plans of rescuing their young son who about a 2 weeks prior crash-landed while parasailing near the island and hasn't been heard from since. Grant soon discovers that he's been duped into something he has absolutely no interest in doing and basically does what he can to get off the island as quickly as he can. His morals kick in and he does the right thing but reluctantly. The storyline is there and was basically well told. Sam Neill has always been a superb actor and he does a very good job here but for some reason or other I felt it wasn't quite up to his level in the first movie. It might have something to do that he's really nothing more than a baby sitter to a bunch of ignorant city folk and if I were in his shoes would have left these people to fend for themselves if they displayed the level of ignorance they did. William H. Macy has always been a good actor and there really isn't a lot you can say negative about his performance, however, I've never been a big fan of Tea Leoni and she really doesn't do anything here for me. She portrays the distraught mother in search of her lost child but comes across dumber than a stick. Who in their right mind, knowing that they're on an island full of vicious prehistoric animals the size of large buildings, goes crashing through the forest aimlessly yelling?? Any sane person would never do that, no matter how distraught they were. Self-preservation would be the first instinct to kick in, especially after surviving a crash landing and a beating from a large vicious dinosaur. While I wasn't real fond of some of the human actors, the dinosaurs were pretty darn good. The special effects were quite well done and they didn't rely completely on CGI. The mechanic dinosaurs held their own and in a lot of ways made the scenes more real as the actors had something to work off of. I particularly liked the one scene where the mighty T-Rex fought the Spinosaur; something we really haven't seen in the other two movies and it gives us a bit of a possible look at what living back then would really be like. Overall, I liked it and would recommend it as a matinee but like I said in the beginning, it doesn't have that `Spielberg' feel to it even though he produced it.",Jurassic Park III
267,d-shilling-1,Quick review,5,29 June 2021,"Not the best movie. Spent pretty much most of it saying "" stop shouting """,Jurassic Park III
268,Rooster99,"Had some good moments, but the worst of the 3.",5,12 January 2005,"As usual, the dinosaurs are impressive, making the film worth seeing. However, this movie is more like ""The 3 Stooges Meets Jurassic Park"". I couldn't stand Tea Leoni's character and kept hoping she would get eaten by a dinosaur. Unfortunately, my hope was in vain as this film followed the Disney-style adventure to an absolute T. There was no way the child was going to come to harm, nor his parents. It was very much like The Lost World in that you knew Spielberg would never allow harm to come to children. It really detracted from the suspense element. As soon as you saw who was in the plane on the way to the island, you could easily predict who would get eaten and who would make it off the island.Back to Tea Leoni. What was she thinking??? Or perhaps I should say, what was the director thinking? What a lame female lead! At least with Julianne Moore and Laura Dern, the women showed an ounce of competence! Teo Leoni acts not like she is on a dinosaur island, but more like she has just come across Scooby Doo. Terrible, just terrible. I fully appreciate comedic moments in suspenseful films to relieve some of the tension, however this movie had very few actual suspenseful moments and the comedic moments were more worth of an Ernest movie.Why does Spielberg insist on having children as the action heroes? Jurassic Park was a very exciting movie, but then he had to go and introduce the Wonder Twins in The Lost World. Killing a raptor by a parallel bars routine?????? It's the same rubbish in this movie, a 12-year old survives for 8 weeks on the island whilst mercenaries don't last 5 minutes. It's the same reason The Temple of Doom was the worst of the Indiana Jones and Phantom Menace was the worst of the Star Wars movies. Just leave the kids at home!! There is no reason to make them all into super-heroes, it just detracts from the adventure and the suspense.Sam Neill, as usual, was excellent. Other than the dinosaurs, he is the one holding this picture together. I just can't help feeling disappointed for what could have been a great movie. The dinosaurs were incredibly well done, and there were a lot of them. It's just the acting, plot, and general story which were lacking. And what was the editor thinking including those terribly unrealistic para-sailing shots at the beginning???? There are some good distance shots, but then the close-ups are so obviously shot on a set that I cannot believe they let that pass. Sloppy, just sloppy. To think they could bring dinosaurs to life in a realistic manner but then leave in shots that look like they come from a 1970's TV adventure is just ludicrous.5/10",Jurassic Park III
269,Old Crow-2,"Hey guys, it´s just entertainment!!!!!!",7,12 August 2002,"What were you expecting, Gone With The Wind? JP3 is meant to be nothing but entertainment. It´s a huge summer blockbuster with a thin plot, thin characters and fantastic special effects. When I went to see this movie in a theater I wanted to see such a movie and that´s exactly what I got.I actually prefer JP3 to the Lost World. The original Jurassic Park is naturally an unbeatable classic that started the whole Dinosaur hysteria. I enjoyed JP2 too, but the final of that movie was a real letdown. Actors in these kind of movies could be total nobodies, but JP3 gives us Tea Leoni (an actress I like very much... She was very good in Family Man and Deep Impact), William H. Macy and Sam Neill who do as much as they can with their characters. Once again the real stars are the gorgeous dinosaurs created by ILM. This time the top billing should go to Spinosaurus which looks a lot scarier than the good old T-Rex. Spinosaurus really knows how to kick some butt! Those new Velociraptors are cool too, but how did they learn to communicate that way? They didn´t talk to each other in the first two parts... Movies are rarely too short, but JP3 is such a film. I wouldn´t have minded if the film had run for another 10 or 20 minutes. But at least the movie doesn´t run out of steam because of its running time.In my opinion JP3 delivers the goods though I hope that it´ll be the final episode of the series. It could´ve been a lot better with a really good, imaginative script. On DVD you can see some early promo posters that indicate a somewhat ""deeper"" movie than the JP3 we were given. Oh well...

Next, the story of the movie and it's plot is a little bit too...silly. A boy who get lost in the island of dinosaurs because he wanted to make some risky sports. OK, so bring Dr Grant, who knows nothing about this island! Ha ha ha! I can't stop laughing at that. The whole movie is a non-stop escaping from the CGI dinosaurs, very well made by the way, difficult to make them difference from the Animatronics. That's a good point. Another good point is to see the Rex smashing the Spino before this one knocks and breaks his neck! We see Pterosaurs, yeah that's more than cool, we were waiting a long time to see them, and not disappointed, very happy with them. The bad things we have here? The music made by Don Davis. He did a great job in Matrix, but when they told him: Tension, he heard: Annoyance, so every time that there is an action sequence, the music gets very high volume, and with lots of shrikes from the instruments like they were torturing ten cats at the same time. If we include Tea Leoni's over-acted performance, then we have the following.

271,CatTales,Eat the rich! or they saved the best(version) for last,8,24 July 2001,"Just when you thought it was safe to visit exclusive resort islands for the very rich (can you imagine the fear rich kids are growing up with now?)...Either I'm just a sucker for good comedy (from subtle to very absurd) or the first 2 JP's had bottomed out my expectations for a decent script, but JP3 comes out on top. There are none of the ""make my day"" swaggering jokes or toilet-seat killings; more like ""Jaws"" (""we're gonna get a bigger boat, right?""). It avoids the nauseating extremes of focusing on kids(JP1) or gore(JP2) though it still clarion blasts the FAMILY UNIT (human or dino)(which doesn't make these family films - would you take a kid to ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre""?). However, at least the idea has some practical benefit (as shown by Laura Dern's rescue which speaks volumes of her unrequited love, and echoes an earlier joke that ""people aren't whom they seem"" - her government Public Relations husband obviously is more than that).The film is more traditionally paced, and even manages to build suspense before the chase scenes, simply by NOT showing things. There's beautiful island photography, and some beautifully intergrated F/X scenes (the stampede, the Ptero's). There's a nice bit of speculative science about raptor intelligence which is, of course, immediately validated (though they're certainly not smarter than dogs/wolves when they fall for the oldest decoy trick in the book); also some continuity with the second movie when Dr Grant ranks on Dr Malcolm 's book. Some obvious flaws: the editing makes it seems unlikely they could outrun the predatory/stampeding dinos. Dr Grant seems glad dinos escape the island. And after all the deaths little Eric still thinks ""it's all worth while."" He's a leatherface waiting to happen. But the acting, or reacting, is up to snuff. Like the Indiana Jones movies, the third one is the best. PREDICTION: Just as plot themes crossbreed with the ALIEN series, JP4 (like Aliens4) will have Laura Dern cloned with a brontosaurus which will fail as a TV pilot for an ""Attack of the 50 ft. woman"" series.",Jurassic Park III

274,KingBrian1,A Sequel That Works,8,7 June 2014,"Alan Grant once again returns to the Island of the Dinosaurs. This time after being tricked by a family who lost their adventurous son. This movie is yet another Grand Jurassic Park tale. This time we see Pterodactyl's & Stegosaurus's and the massive Spinosaurus. This movie is a treat for Dinosaur lovers and enthusiasts not to mention Palaeontologists.As with any Hollywood story combining facts with interesting stories is very hard. Making Wall Street was difficult because it made finance & Banking which is boring very entertaining. War movies have the opposite effect because action and violence will naturally gravitate people towards seeing these movies. Now to create not only a movie about Dinosaurs but to follow on with two more sequels with quality is quite an achievement.Take the Star Wars trilogy. Yes those movies were great and indeed it even made the politics interesting but fast forward to the prequel movies and here you had movies that could write themselves with action, adventure & a myriad of subplots. Despite all that the movies were not successful. Jurassic Park III does not try to beat the first movie but instead tries to be an enjoyable watch.I thought the movie was very good. It had a small cast and most of the energy of the film emanated from the Dinosaurs. It was better than the second movie which had a much more in depth story involving Ingen and a T-Rex running around town. This movie was slow and careful. We get a moreintimate experience of the Island similar to the First movie. It lacksthe grandness of the original. The visuals are more important in this movie.Sequels should emulate or have this movie in mind when thinking of doing a sequel to other great films.",Jurassic Park III
275,Nigel St. Buggering,Joe Johnston rescues the franchise,7,25 July 2001,"""Jurassic Park III"" is successful largely because the filmmakers realize the limitations of the kind of film they're making.  This is a film in which the plot exists only as a thinly-veiled device to set up scenes of dinosaurs attempting to consume people.  Spielberg's mistake with ""The Lost World"" was that he seemed to think he was doing something bigger and more glamorous, and he fell short.This is a movie out to have a good time; it's a Saturday matinee Ray Harryhausen monster spectacular, and it has it all.  The effects, as expected, are incredible.  The dinosaurs are more real than ever before, including a few choice cosmetic touches such as more interesting skin colorations, and little dorsal spikes.  The raptors benefit the most from this, since we have earlier comparisons, but the work is excellent all around.Does it make a lot of sense?  Not particularly.  Would a predator really single-mindedly pursue a meal across the island when it could just as easily return to its own territory?  Would a pteradon pick up a human being without spearing him with its talons, then present it to its young still alive and kicking?  Clearly, the answers to these and many other questions is no, but does it really matter?  This is a monster movie, not a Discovery channel special.The biggest problem is with the appearance yet again of the velociraptors. This is their third bow as the villains, and they're getting a bit old. With some two hundred species catalogued, was it really necessary to keep going back to the well on these?  Fortunately, the new species that are featured are well-used, particularly the pteradons, whom I personally have been waiting for all along.It also touches (briefly) on the effect that an island of living dinosaurs would have on the world.  How interested would paleantologists be in digging up fossils if they could just fly out to Isla Sorna and watch live specimens?  Would rich, risk-taking tourists buzz the island looking for thrills?This is a solid adventure/monster film in the tradition of the 60's and 70's classics.

It might belong to the lost world, and even that one's a good movie. Flaws? Names. Spinosaurus? Come on... it should sound a little more threatening. Next: Length. This is probably the shortest non-animated movie I've ever seen. The plot was good, not terrible. The dinosaurs seem smarter, stronger and faster than ever before. The space between each of the the movies has usually been 4 years (JP in '93, TLW in '97, JPIII in '01). But JP4 is set to come out (last time I heard) December 31, 2006. Quite a while from now. Either way, I'm looking forward to it. Go out and rent this. You won't be disappointed.",Jurassic Park III
277,MinorityReporter,"A little less conversation, a little more action!",6,24 November 2005,"The third Jurassic Park film is a decent film but it lacks certain elements to make it a very good film. The most crucial thing is Spielberg's directorial touch. Joe Johnston is not nearly as skilled a film maker as Spielberg and it is clearly felt. Johnston has a pretty good flair for the action scenes but the emotional, human based scenes are severely lacking. Luckily Spielberg is still a producer on the film allowing him to have some influence on the final product.Acting wise the film has taken a step down from the two previous films. Spielberg put a lot of effort into making all characters seem well rounded in both of the previous films in the series but this approach seems to have been abandoned somewhat for the third film. Sam Neill is a welcome return and even though his character is nowhere near as developed in the first film he still produces the best performance by far in the film. William H. Macy is decent but not the best I've seen from him. He is, however, adequate. Téa Leoni is more stiff in her acting. Even though I usually like her, her performance in this film seems somewhat forced and not completely believable. Where the film truly suffers is with the characters of Billy and Eric (played by Alessandro Nivola and Trevor Morgan). Neither of the characters are believable. Especially not Eric who apparently has survived for 8 weeks on an island inhabited by hungry dinosaurs. This is preposterous to say the least as Trevor Morgan comes off as being a spoiled brat rather than a Rambo-like survivor. The fact that he survived for 8 weeks is casually explained with him being hard to ground when he was younger(!). I mean, how ridiculous can you get.The film isn't bad, however, and has many entertaining sequences. The effects have naturally improved and the dinosaurs look more realistic than ever before. New concepts have been added to some of the species. Like, for instance, a row of feathers on top of the male raptors heads. As with the previous films an incredible attention has been paid to the details and this provides for a high level of credibility that these creatures might actually exist. Some scenes really had my blood pumping like in the previous films and this is where Johnston proves his worth. The best scene is undoubtedly a battle between a tyrannosaurus and the new addition the spinosaurus which is even larger than the tyrannosaurus. This scene I can watch again and again. Even though I prefer the tyrannosaurus as a symbol for the films I think it is appropriate that a new, fresh dinosaur was used.The moral aspect is not as clear in this film as it was in the previous film and is only ever mentioned in one particular scene and it seems clear that the film was just made to prove how far the level of effects had progressed and the film proved that they have progressed pretty far. Conclusionary Jurassic Park III is not as good as neither of the previous in the series but it is entertaining and worth a look if only for the effects sake.6/10",Jurassic Park III
278,anchoreddown,"Underrated and extremely overlooked,.......",8,31 January 2018,"This may be the lowest point in box office for the Jurassic Park franchise, however, in light of both reading up on the spinosaurus and watching several YouTube videos on the franchise, I'm coming to appreciate the work that went into the third Jurassic movie.
First off, as most people have noted, this is not like the other three films. Yes, it may not have much of a scare tactic, but it all boils down to how well you know your dinosaurs. 
Go back to 2001. Research for undiscovered dinosaurs, like the spinosaurus was quite new and different. This animal was chosen for it's distinctive size, power and energy. The production team was looking for something larger than the T-Rex and the reason this dinosaur was chosen was for it's crocodile like snout, which makes it stand out next to it's cousins in the relative chain. Upono closer inspection, if you actually know something of the animal, it was more of an aquatic animal, and the research, as eluded to in the trivia section had the dinosaur standing on four to two legs, depending on your source material. Therefore, with this kind of information, you can get an idea of what's really going on behind the scenes for the storyline when it comes to actually breeding the animals. It's an obvious hybrid, even through it isn't stated in the film. 
I honestly don't think it was the studios intention to create a hybrid dinosaur. What we got is actually quite brilliant, it's a monster movie, but with a Jurassic Park twist. The fact that they chose to do it this way and leave the audience w questions until the next movie furthers the idea that the spinosaurus is a hybrid. Most people are probably looking at the animal and wishing it was a T-Rex, because that is the star of the franchise. 
Mot people probably didn't like it for several obvious reasons, but it's the dinosaurs that shine the most in this episode of the Jurassic Park franchise. Two thumbs up for doing something completely different!!",Jurassic Park III

The dinosaurs didn't look real at all. So this horrible writer/director/producer took away all the magic from the first one. Its really dumb and it should've never been made. Why did they have to make sequels to Jurassic park?! I haven't seen Lost world, but this movie proves its bad. I hope Jurassic world is better than this. The trailer for it looks good. But seriously, this was toxic. It should be lowered from a 5.9/10 to a 1.5/10 just like Justin Bieber: Never say never.As of 2/26/15 this movie has 7564 10/10s and 3383 1/10s.

With III we get what we should have had with the second one.  No, there is no real character development (but do you need that in every movie?) as there is no real reason to in this movie.  This is a true movie about survival in a world of dinosaurs.  When you are trying to survive you are going to have a lot of action.  III gives you all of the action you want and more.

The acting is not spectacular (except for a few scenes) the dialogs are also not spectacular and sometimes even abominable.The plot is just an excuse to see people being attacked by dinosaurs.But, I must say, the majority of the action scenes are quite good and sometimes the film is very exciting.If you like dinosaurs, and if you don't mind a stupid script, you will enjoy it.",Jurassic Park III
283,tripper0,over budgeted Godzilla movie......,2,24 July 2001,"I went to see this movie with a fairly open mind.  I didn't expect much of a plot or story.  All I expected was semi-decent dialogue to move the story(or lack there of)ahead to the next sequence of action.Instead what I got was eighty boring, and at times laugh aloud funny, minutes.  The dialogue was just so horrible.  This had B movie written all over it.  I have a place in my heart for B movies, but not this one.  This was Godzilla with a budget, and without the heart. William H. Macy was here, and I can't figure out why.  After great movies such a Pleasantville and Fargo, I am ashamed for him for showing up in this pile of trash. The ending, well, I won't spoil anything for any of you who are anxious to go out and see this, but lets just say its disappointing, and really against everything Jurassic park has been.  What was once a series of suspensful movies has given way to the Hollywood money machine. The first movie, a classic, and this one is a far cry from that day.  We've seen it all before, and its been better before.  More dinosaurs and more volume doesn't make it scarier, it just gives you more of a head ache.  At least at eighty five minutes or so, they put you out of your misery as quickly as possible.  But it wasn't fast enough for me.  Plus, it has my vote for one of the worst ending scenes in movie history.  Two out of ten, but one of them is a charity point.",Jurassic Park III
284,The Spectacular Spider-Man,Doesn't even attempt to suggest a hint of a plot,5,30 November 2005,"The original JP at least had the plot of capitalists abusing mother nature and the resultant chaos teaching a Frankenstein message. It had a theme park out of control, Alan Grant learning to be a father-figure (you should put that in all your films, Steven - oh, you already have), greedy traitor Dennis Nedry attempting to cash-in on the park's secrets, and Malcolm's whole chaos theory stuff.....The Lost World was much darker, bitter Spielberg, about how evil capitalism is. The now very-sober, brooding Malcolm's ominous gaze is very much Spielberg's own when regarding the merciless strip mining of nature itself. Technically, it had twice as much story as JP3 - it had people running from dinosaurs, but it also had the fight against the poachers that ended up Godzilla style in NY.What's the plot of JP3? Kid gets lost on island. People go to rescue him. Dinosaurs on island are smarter than previously thought. That's it.Only weeks before JP3 went into production, the script was changed, and the producers were all praising the new version, saying they'd gone for a stronger story at the last minute.I shudder to think at what the previous script must have contained. Is it possible to have less story than JP3? JP3's story is just an explanation as to why everyone is on Isla Sorna, and then into the mayhem.

The scares aren't nearly as well done. I was very disappointed by it. It does have some good scares but not nearly as good as the first two. It may be that the movie makers of this aren't as talented or that they just couldn't think of as good ideas. Some of the special effects don't seem as good as in the first two.

I wasnt expecting much at all but to be honest it was quite refreshing and many parts made me jump which is what I like when it's meant to be a scary movie. The effects are as per usual great but 'The Lost World' is seriously lacking in storyline and the manner in which Jeff Goldblum and the other survivors escape is totally unrealistic.I think Sam Neill is a good actor, but there is nothing worse than an actor in a sequel who you can tell is simply in it for the money. Thankfully, Neill's performance does not suggest this as he is great in his reprisal of his role as jurassic expert Dr. Grant. This sequel just pips 'The Lost World' basically because of the storyline and it's realism. Don't get me wrong, Jeff Goldblum I think although he has never changed in all of his acting since he played the Brundle fly is hilarious in the second film, but a good film is not just about the actors who are in it, it needs to have substancially more than that.

""Let's just keep going, keep makin' 'em"" was the philosophy; purely a money-making adventure for the production company, no desire for quality. The movie is so bad that it took another 14 years for them to try to make another one. That says a lot.The script is incompetent and the characters are irritating. We just keep wishing one of the main characters would get eaten alive like the minor characters do. There's nothing redeeming about them - nothing redeeming about Sam Neill either. Close-up shots of him looking at things in his character's annoying way gets really annoying. We get it, come on. The milking of CGI dino fights is egregious. Yes, sequels usually resort to ""overdoing"" the original (for example, Alien/Aliens), but this was just ridiculous. Relying on CGI as the primary plot vehicle will never work, and it reveals the cheap, gimmicky nature of the movie.

292,mbworm,"Exciting, but it's gotten tired",6,18 March 2008,"""Jurassic Park"" was an original and scary thrill ride that introduced the stunning effects of Stan Winston; it was the debut of bloodthirsty cloned dinosaurs that managed to escape and prey on humans. Steven Spielberg kept the plot tight and the action spectacular, but the drama was sparse. Ah well, nobody went to see a tearjerker, they wanted to get that chill in their bones when the T-Rex was introduced and the raptors came out of the shadows.Then came ""The Lost World"", where Spielberg lost himself in a long but successful combo of drama and more terrifying dinosaur effects. It was no ""Jurassic Park"" but it was still a cut above the rest, a great thrill ride that was entertaining and scary.And now comes ""Jurassic Park III"", and it works so well because it's so damn shameless. This one finds a rich couple coaxing Alan Grant (Sam Neill reprising his role from the first film) into being their tour guide on a flight over Isla Sorna, ""Site B"" where there are still dinosaurs living naturally in their own habitat. The area is not only restricted but the couple (William H. Macy and Tea Leoni) actually land on the island with intentions unknown to Grant- to find their missing son who disappeared when parasailing on the coast of the island.About ten minutes into the film the plane has crashed and left the group, (which also includes a nerdy pilot and Grant's ambitious paleontologist protégé Billy), hopelessly stranded. Not to mention at the hands of a new, bigger and badder carnivorous monster, the Spinosaurus, who sports a gigantic sail and boasts a huge mouth full of razor sharp teeth. He puts the T-Rex to shame (but where the hell was he in ""The Lost World"", where another group of people was also on Isla Sorna?). As soon as the eccentric couple's intentions are clear to Grant, they have to stick together and survive the brutal, never-ending attacks from various dinosaurs while they search for their teenage son (Trevor Morgan.) The movie really is literally shameless, moving at a lighting fast pace and throwing in every action movie cliché into the mix possible, at the same time introducing tons of new species of dinosaurs into the story that weren't apparent before. There are plenty of satisfying chills and the movie keeps you entertained for its short running time of 90 minutes, but it lacks the Spielberg charm, style and brains that made the first two movies so much more original and fun.",Jurassic Park III

But then, they kept making more trailers that showed key scenes and quite frankly guys, making a dozen trailers for a 90 minute movie takes any hint of suspense away when you finally see the film! I could literally edit all the trailers together and condensed the entire film into 2 minutes!

Guys, why did you even bother? Your complaints all state the obvious: No Spielberg, too short, no story, bad dialogue...which we all agree with. So how about ""awesome CGI, great action, fast pacing"" and the like? Heck, it is summer, it is a mindless Hollywood venture, so loosen up! Even the soundtrack sans John Williams is still great!

When their only way out has been terminated by the newest, biggest dinosaur, they are thrown into an uncontrolled environment with uncontrolled creatures, with only skeletal-digger Alan Grant to help them, who hasn't even been to that particular island, and is already fighting to stay alive amongst the nightmarish creatures that he so much once loved and was so fascinated.This was not quite as great as the original, (but what sequel ever is?), but it was far better than the ""Lost World"".

The second and third in the series took a little too much for granted, too inclined to lean on the proved, successful moments of the first and so not innovative in any way. Yet, there are more high points than low points, and they are each excellent examples of the film-maker's craft. They all carry you away to a whole different plane, professionally and enjoyably, and apart from Avatar and a few other exceptions like LOTR,early Harry Potters, perhaps a couple I haven't named, few other movie series have been as well constructed.

It it was a real shame that Laura Dern's character wasn't given more to do instead (like actually accompany the expedition, rather than just sit at home in the States with her kid and answer the phone). But that aside, the other characters were fine - I even thought that the ""brat"" kid Erik was quite likable - and of course the dinosaurs were magnificently brought to life yet again. It was also nice to see some new dinosaurs like the spinosaurus, the ankylosaurus and (best of all) the flying pteranodons - focussing just on T-Rex and the raptors for a third time would have been ""too much of a good thing"". The story was a bit predictable I guess, but that said, it wasn't supposed to be a documentary or tax the brain too much. It's pure entertainment and in that respect it delivers.As someone else pointed out, the ending was perhaps a bit weak - a skirmish between the U.S. Marines and the raptors would have made for an exciting climax to the film - but all in all I'd give this one 7 out of 10.

Based on two premises, (1) that velociraptors can communicate with each other on a high level, and (2) that a recently separated couple's 12-year-old kid goes missing on a dinosaur island off Costa Rica, you can probably figure out where the film's going to go if you've yet to see it, given twenty seconds thinking time.

The only reason this movie made the amount of money that it did is the fact that the title has the two words ""Jurassic Park"" in it. people were paying for nothing more than a brand name but they didn't realize at the time, they thought since Spielberg had created such a huge legacy with the first two films they were going to see more of that amazing legacy by going to see JP3. Sorry guys, each and every one of you were wrong... I was wrong also, because I was 11 years old and I knew no better....Sam Neill retains his iconic role as Paleontologist Alan Grant, and he's the only redeeming character of this movie who has any kind of development, he knows how dangerous dinosaurs are and there's no such thing as safety on an island where they are running amok.... he's made out to be a lot more leather tongued in this movie than the first one, but that's where the character development falls completely dead. none of the other characters you care about and it ends up following the same traditional recipe of whoever gets the least amount of screen time and the least amount of dialogue dies first...The entire concept of the Spinosaurus is the most ridiculous idea this movie could have tried to incorporate. This movie is set on Isla Sorna (the same island The Lost World takes place on), and there's zero mention of this dinosaur in either the movie or the original novel, but oh no let's have a dinosaur that's even larger than the T-Rex constantly chasing a group of 5 or 6 people when in the lost world there was a huge ingen expedition of well over 100 people vehicles and everything and this enormous beast never shows up once in that film??? You mean to tell me there were at least Two T-Rex's on isla sorna (3 if you include the infant), and neither of the adult Rex's once ran into the Spinosaurus??? I would say that's downright impossible considering the entire island is only made out to be 7 or 8 miles long...... Not to mention this spino can somehow move around with silent footsteps (again we're talking about an animal that's larger than the T-Rex). all in all GIVE ME A GOD DAMN BREAK!!!!!Paul and Amanda (William H. Macy and Tea Leoni), are the most annoying on screen parents i've ever seen in a movie. it didn't bother me when I was 11 but it drives me up the wall big time now. They're continuous bickering attracts no dinosaurs as they're trekking right through the middle of the jungle, she basically screams down the walls of a fortress when she has her encounter with Bens dead body that also somehow attracts no dinosaurs even though she's screaming at the top of her lungs right near where the Raptors nests are....And then to slop the icing on top of the cake we have Eric, the kid who we find out has somehow managed to survive 8 weeks all by himself on this island.... This is just the film makers insulting their audience at this point.... Not to mention how terrible the CGI is at times and the lack of plot in general really makes this movie boil down to just one giant chase scene, only they switch the dinosaurs up every so often in a last ditch effort to keep things fresh, first its the spino, then the raptors, then the spino again, then the pteranodons, then the spino again, then the raptors again rinse and repeat until the end credits roll.....Enjoyed this movie when I was 11, but people DO change, I know I have changed, I rated this 3 starts because I enjoyed it 19 years ago.

But when compared with the fierce, heart pounding awe we felt when the original Jurassic Park roared into theaters eight years ago, the latest incarnation is pretty flat. The director of the first two installments, Steven Spielberg, relinquishes the reins this time (he stays on as Executive Producer). His seemingly logical fill-in is Joe Johnston, a man who's studied under Spielberg and who's spent his career making Spielberg-esque family adventure films like Jumanji and Honey, I Shrunk the Kids. But as hard as he tries, Johnston is no Spielberg. The action sequences are fine, but they lack the tension and sly choreography that only the master can supply. Spielberg can create more dread with two rattling cups of water (remember those ominous ripples from the first film?) than Johnston can with a whole species of ILM-created dinos. The new guy also has trouble giving the dinosaurs quite as much personality as the ones in the previous films. He's not helped by the effects department, which seems to be slipping. The new Big Man on Campus, Spinosaurus -- think T-Rex, only with a big fin on his back -- is a little too rubbery to be believed. That said, Johnston is to be applauded considering the thankless task he had presented to him -- make yet another fun summer blockbuster about dinosaurs run amok on a tropical island. We haven't just seen this before -- we've seen it twice before. The results are all the more impressive considering the script was reportedly thrown completely out the window just prior to shooting (the final screenplay is partially credited to Jim Taylor and Alexander Payne, the duo who wrote the ingenious comedy, Election). The lack of a complete script may explain why this installment is the shortest (barely more than 90 minutes) and has the simplest plot.Two of the movie's key action sequences (a river encounter with a big dino and a terrifying journey through a giant ""bird cage"" housing pterodactyls) are wisely lifted from passages of Michael Crichton's original novel that never made it into the first film. Not surprisingly, this is when the movie is at its best. The sequel also advances the evolution of the raptors -- in this film, the raptors have gained the ability to ""talk"" to each other. They're also getting smarter -- they're now able to set traps for their human prey. It's a nice new twist, but if this film series wants to avoid extinction, it needs to get off the island once and for all. The last 20 minutes of ""The Lost World"" teased us with the intriguing premise of a T-Rex romping through suburbia. Why not a whole movie of that? (Suggested title: It Came From Jurassic Park!) There's room for this franchise to grow if the writers have enough imagination. In this film, the dinosaurs seem to be evolving at an accelerated pace. What if they continue to get smarter and smarter as they reach land? By the time Jurassic Park VII rolls around, they should be smarter than humans. They would start to take over the world and by the end of the series, people would be the ones becoming extinct. I can't think of a more fitting ending for a sci-fi saga that is essentially a cautionary tale about the foolishness of mankind messing with nature.",Jurassic Park III

But then no one would need to see the film. In this sequel, a rag-tag group pays a visit to the island of dinosaurs to rescue the teenage victim of a hang-gliding accident.ACCESS HOLLYWOOD reports JP3 began filming without a completed script. That explains why the film seems to have little or no purpose other than to demonstrate state-of-the-art special effects. Sure, there are a few clever scenes and some moderately funny bits, but no meaningful plot line to tie them together. The dinosaur puppets and animation in JP3 are very good to excellent, and more numerous than ever. But the overall film experience can not hold a candle to the original JURASSIC PARK or even JP2.JP3 is a mercifully short 90 minutes -- the last 10 minutes of which is credits. Even at that, I found myself frequently checking my wristwatch. The audience I saw it with left the theater in silence.A better bet:  see the movie LEGALLY BLONDE.

304,Daviteo,After another watching,6,25 April 2017,"This review contains spoilers.Just watched Jurassic Park III again because it was on Netflix and I was binge-watching the series, and I think I have a solid understanding as to why this is my least favorite of the series:From a purely technical perspective the live-action dinosaurs, particularly the Spinosaurus, are, of course, magnificent. Cinematography is good. The music, while mostly a rehash of old themes and chase music, is acceptable. Mechanical effects, particularly the large sinking-boat night river scene at the end of the film, are again superb. All this is par for the course in a Jurassic Park sequel, and they do a great job with those elements here. In fact, it's nice to be back in an actual tropical location, unlike the redwoods of Lost World they used to substitute for Isla Sorna. The one exception is the terrible opening green-screen wind-sailing sequence at the beginning, but I'll let that slide.But everything regarding story, pacing, and plot is a complete disaster, and this is what keeps Jurassic Park III hovering just slightly above a ""made for DVD"" release. If it weren't for the masterful technical elements stated above, this would absolutely feel like a bargain-bin DVD release.A solid story could have been hashed out by the writers even for the 90 minutes of the film's runtime, but instead we get some cobbled-together hackneyed story about a kid who gets lost and survives for eight weeks in Dino Central, something that even survivalist adults would have a hard time doing, and the crew that rescues him. Also, Alan Grant is shoehorned into the film because reasons.The first half of the film is a pacing train wreck, with no suspense or deliberation paid to bringing the audience into the story. Instead, the director seems to say ""you want some dinosaurs, okay, here are some I guess. And some more. Here's an action sequence in a wrecked jet that's in-your-face, why not."" There's no artistry to the lead-up, there's no anticipation or excitement that the film's predecessors had (in particular Jurassic Park). Instead we get technically astounding dinosaurs in what could have been a high-schooler's script that was rushed into production (in fact, apparently the script wasn't done when they started filming).So we end up with a direct-to-DVD sequel that happens to have big-budget special effects, and that makes for a poor third entry into this series. If I had to be really precise, I'd give it a 5.5 or 5.75, but I rounded up to be nice.",Jurassic Park III

When Jurassic Park 3 was in the cinema, i begged my parents to see it on the first day, at the time it was amazing but now i think about it my opinions changed...Compared to the first Jurassic Park this films very plan and lacking a good storyline. As Dr.Allen Grant is hired to tour a divorced couple around the island, he is unknowingly being tricked into finding the couples lost son Eric.Its good to see some of the cast returning but there was no well-known actors for such a famous series.

Grant needs money bad to fund his diggings, so he reluctantly accepts the offer. But when they arrive at the island, it turns out the Kirbys had other motives. They have a son who is all alone on the island, and they want to save him at any cost. Grant has to face his worst nightmare once again. Oh, and their plane crashes.""The Lost World"" was a huge disappointment to me, it was too silly, with irritating characters and it had a stinker of an ending. But fortunately, Jurassic Park 3 is everything the sequel should have been. It has bigger and meaner dinosaurs, and more suggestive environments and exciting scenes. The Spinosaur is great to look at (although he was a bit too scary for me), but my favorite dinosaur this time around was definitely the Pteranodon, the ""bird-dinosaurs"". That scene was more exciting than anything that ""The Lost World"" had to offer during its whole running-time. Joe Johnston is certainly a good choice if you want action.The effects have not been modified that much since last time, but they are still spectacular. Of course you can see when it´s CGI-effects and when it´s Stan Winston´s mechanic dinosaurs, but still. My only complaint about the dinosaurs is that the classical T.Rex wasn´t showcased that much. And for the sequel (yes, JP4 is already on its way) it would be cool to see some water-based creatures. It was a relief to see Sam Neill again, oh have I waited for his return! He makes a solid performance as Alan Grant, and the supporting actors (William H Macy, Tea Leoni, Alessandro Nivola, Michael Jeter), do fine jobs as well. Trevor Morgan was a bit too much of a mix of ""Young Indiana Jones"" and ""MacGyver"" for me to appreciate, but he wasn´t all bad.
Everything was great with JP3, untill that ending I mean, what was that? Did they run out of money, or ideas perhaps? Yes, it is actually worse than the ending of ""The Lost World"" (!), which means it´s really, really bad. It ruins the overall impact, sadly.Still a great roller-coaster for the whole family, and 90 minutes of running time is perfect. Now I´m looking forward to seeing the dinos for a fourth time.* * * ½",Jurassic Park III
308,miroslavhradel,Nowhere near as exciting and convincing as its predecessors,4,11 May 2020,"Watching the third and final part of the original Jurassic Park trilogy was a pretty disappointing experience. Although the movie features many of the same plot elements as the previous two installments, its story never truly becomes gripping. As far as the visual effects are concerned, it fails to achieve the same level of quality and authenticity as seen in its two predecessors.The film's nucleus consists of numerous foot chases on Isla Sorna, which is the same island that was the main setting of the second part of the trilogy, The Lost World. In the third installment, however, these foot chases repeatedly appear to be more comical than exciting. Furthermore, they are preceded by a relatively uneventful opening twenty minutes and end in an utterly uninspired and hardly believable manner. Equally unconvincing was the idea of someone being able to survive on this type of island for eight weeks by mainly using items found inside a facility that appeared to have been abandoned several years ago. At the end of the day, there were too many moments in the movie when it appeared to be struggling in order to avoid becoming ridiculous and ultimately unwatchable, especially when taking into account the fact that it is barely an hour and a half long.The visual effects were nowhere near as convincing as in the first two parts of the trilogy. It started at the film's very beginning, with the close-up shots of the two parasailers appearing to be mismatched with the scenery in the background at all times. It continued with the dinosaurs not being as realistically represented as in the previous two movies. The performances were relatively good, although William H. Macy and Téa Leoni were not always at their best as a stereotypical divorced couple that has to work together to solve a problem, with Leoni overacting way too often.",Jurassic Park III
309,andras-ocskay,Lamepark,1,3 August 2018,"After 10 min the music is too cheese I cant take it
At speech its too obvious what will be happen in the movie. They overexplain everything for the audiance (as normal in hollywood movies).The joke on plain is clamsy when a raptor appears on dream scene.
Could be more realistic, maybe the dino grab his arm when start talk to him, than He should wake up.
Spilberg has no sence for this at all.Than again horrible cheesy music is constant.Plain crash when try to depart, good drama. But soon after that clasmy again. After high speed crash nobody got whiplash, nobody throw up, or hit their head, not even a pulled muscle. So lame.
At least the pilot is sweating.The plain crushed half, so lame.
Than roll on the floor. 
Please note NOBODY feel pain, not even a pulled muscle.The dino is tired or stupid? 
Hunts so quick but when there is a chance to grab them just miss the targets. Instead of bite or silent hunting constantly making idiot dino noises, and with wide open mouth roaring without aim.
Anybody in Hollywood have they ever seen a hunting animal? 
Why they make noise? Why they just try to scare them but not eat them? Ehy all monsters in Hollywood open mouth roaring when upclose to somebody instead of eating them?Oh and they run away from that monster. So lameThan trex came in scene with stupid sond effects again, and they fight.
Bad actions, dino fall on floor, unbreakable humans just run away in last second. LameThe gruoup shout around 'Eric' but no animals find but they find that parachute. How is this possible?
Tha the dramaturg thought it will be an evidence if they see in accidentely left camera on what happened. Yes its a good idea, but again Spilberg has no sence for it.
Camera should dropped on floor and record how they landed and walked away, than hours empty (of course record the jungle, maybe some animals walk up-down)
But not. Spliberg has to make them say ""oh, the camera is still on""
And the guy still holds the camera in his hand?? 
In dangerous situation that would be the first what he throw away, not holding tgru falling, and records exacly in the right angle the buy was alive when unhooked him.
Its bad dramaturg so bad.
Tha stupid conclusion: ""they alive""
Why? They just landed alive. That not mean they still alive so many weeks afterAnd they find the guys sceleton rotten till bones. 
How is it possible not any animal find him on the tree??
They try to act it smells but I think they should put someting there what is really smells. Acting is so bad.Runnin around and shouting in the empty(?) jungle. Some bird chriping only. Even an european forest more loud of animals than this ""wild"" jungle.Oh they hide the parachute to not get more attraction. Why? Just loosing time to mess with correctly folded canvas. Why they do that??
Could be sence if they WANT attraction for later rescue, or they say""could be useful"" but they just folding it with no real reason.Wending machine scene could be some real. Started funny but ended so lame. The guy did not find the way to get anything out when kicked the machine the walks away linping.
Why? He survived a plain crash and falling from tree and so on, but that gay kick was hutt so he is limp?
Spliberg you messed this also.Than a so intelligent raptor shows up. Hunting alone, but they not hunt alone. They run quick but this one is slow amd clumsy.
At least that dine could have a wound and limp, to see thats why so slow. But this is healthy and ahould be smarter.
4 human cant hold the door when raptor push it. But on JP1 a small kid pushed the dino back by himself, next time his sister helpes him. Third time 2 adult beeded to push the door. Now in JP3 even 4 adult is not enough.
So lameAll of them run away, but Alan stops for tooooo long and say for stupid audience ""he/she is call for help""
That was so obvious why on earth he stopped? Raptors communicate with sound what humans cant hear? But we hear. And they making so lame sounds and hunan gestures again.Alan surrounded by 4 raptors and nothing is happening!!
Than from nowhere a lot of tear gas rolls out.
Eric the kid seems smarter than anybody on this group. He is covered and know a safe place.Hurray a smart person at least. But not laso long, he leave his bunker wide open when they leave. Birds cant hurt they in water when they poking themBirs fall in water why cant fly?Water monster miss all the targetsGasoline burns on water too much, but at least the boat did not exploded. Thanks
Monster not runs away, stand in the fire and look clamsy.
Than walk away?In the end nobody injured! Fall in sallow river but not hurt. Fire around, monsters poke them and gram with claws but no blood no wounds.Than the navy save them? So lame. So hollywood. So cheesy as the music.
Why not say in the end ""joint the US army NOW""? This movie is so bad",Jurassic Park III

A plane crashes on Isla Sorna, and these people have to avoid getting eaten by the dinos, I think. That is one of the stupidest plots I've ever heard. Other than that, I don't know what the plot is because it's all a convoluted mess. Let's try to follow the story here. A kid and his dad are stranded on the island (whom we never refer to again), and we see this film's main star, Sam Neill, once again playing Dr. Grant. He has a kid, I think. And he goes on this plane and soon crash for reasons they don't explain. Let's say the plane crashed when pterodactyls attacked it. The story is just all over the place! Terrible story, terrible dialogue and a forgettable cast and characters. And I tried to follow the story, I really did. And the lighting in this film is horrendous. Everything in this movie looks like a dingy, dirty and filthy blanket with mud stains and weird gunk all over it. Although I do like the design for some of the dinos.

The acting in this movie, other than Sam Neil, is crap. And that is what lowers this movie's score.

Here, Neill gets to do more as Dr. Grant, interact with the dinos of Isla Sorna and come outwith more appreciation for the genetically engineered dinos than he had after part 1.Story wise--its pretty standard bubblegum fare--though they tried to give it a few twists.

They were shown defending themselves, fighting off pesky humans with cameras, drinking water, slipping on the ground, scratching themselves, creeping over shyly with the encouragement of a parent to give the villian his comeuppance--much more in keeping with the spirit of a Ray Harryhausen or Willis O'Brien film. JP3 returns us to the monster depiction for the carnosaurs(exception for the velociraptors, who for a change arent quite the one dimensional baddies they were in the other two films).There are a couple of good scenes, namely the Spinosaurus and the Aviary sequences.

There's lots of action and plenty of dinosaur attacks to keep you interested. The pteradactyl scenes are especially strong.Now the negatives. Some of the characters are pretty annoying which isn't always bad in a monster movie. It makes it all the more enjoyable seeing those characters get munched. Unfortunately, (SPOILER ALERT) some of the characters who should have been eaten, specifically William Macy and Tea Leoni, somehow survive. (END OF SPOILER ALERT) All that said, the ending was one of the worst I have ever seen. Other than the fact that it was totally far-fateched and sudden, it also had the misfortune of being unintentionally hilarious.

316,TexMetal4JC,Much better...,7,11 August 2001,"It seemed during this movie that the makers of JP3 were trying to expunge all memory of JP2 from the audience's collective memory. Aside from a brief mention at the beginning, the San Diego T-Rex fiasco was avoided, and instead JP3 focuses where it should: A jungle-island with lots of big dinosaurs chasing little people. And it sure is fun!No analyzation of the directing, because it's not really anything to be noted (which is good, don't distract from the dinos). No analyzation of the acting, because with Neill, Leoni and Macy, you know you're gonna get good performances in roles that don't require much else. No analyzation of the plot, because it simply doesn't exist.JP3 holds true more to the originals' flare of just sitting back and enjoying the dinosaurs. Granted, the original truly is a horror/thriller classic, with great acting/directing/plot, some truly memorable scenes, and an idea that had never been done in such a way before. But the novelty is gone, and Spielberg and Co. realized that inventing new places for dinos to roam just didn't work. So back to the basics. Jurasic Park III isn't a classic movie of course. It certainly isn't as good as the original. But it is much better than the second one (Much like the Scream trilogy: the 3d is done in a self-parody type of style that makes it much more enjoyable to watch). So give it a watch, but don't analyze it, please, because it just isn't that kind of flick (although I must say the end is just so incredibly tacked-on and off the wall).

My next greatest disappointment was that this movie left me wanting more.  There just wasn't enough time to fully develop the full potential of this storyline.  The more I think about the good parts made me feel that there could, nay should, have been more.The best part of the movie was the return of Dr. Alan Grant.  I was disappointed with the second instalment because only Ian Malcolm returned (don't get me wrong, I did enjoy Jeff Goldblum's performance, but he just wasn't the chaotician he was in the first instalment).  Kudos to Sam Neill for a bang-up performance.The special effects were awesome, and the new look for the raptors was cool. The brief but impressive battle between the big dinosaur and the T-Rex was cool; I only wished that it lasted longer with greater detail.The only thing is that this movie should have been longer.  In that extra span of time, they (Grant and Billy) should have been briefly discussing why the appearances of the raptors changed and about how this new dinosaur came to be, one that was not included on Ingen's list.  Mutant aberrations?  Too much in-breeding?  Something to do with amphibian DNA?  It would have been nice to hear their take on it, but if they need to cut costs, why not cut out scientific discussions.Although its only been my first viewing of the movie, it seemed as though Grant and Billy were unable to catalogue the dinosaur with the spines. There were a few guesses, but Grant dismissed them.This movie left me asking the question, ""Why?""I do not claim to be a dinosaur expert, but I have to ask:  with so many large herbivores (which may not be quite right to begin with considering the number of carnivores in such a small area), how is it that everything is so lush and green?  According to the informational documentary ""Walking with Dinosaurs,"" such herbivores take many years to grow (providing that they survive), and they eat continuously throughout the day, and even knock over the trees to the ground if they have to.Another question (although they did not dwell on it much in the movie) would be (and I hate to do this, but)...***SPOILER ALERT***  ***SPOILER ALERT***  ***SPOILER ALERT*** ...how is it that a kid at the age of 15 could survive in a land infested with carnivores for eight weeks?  Not only that, but he was hiding at the Site B compound, right smack in the middle of, if memory serves me, raptor territory.  Reading Grant's two books and Malcolm's book would not prepare anyone for the vigours of surviving a prehistoric world.  They just referred to the kid as being resourceful.  Great.  That explains everything.  He should have been a dino treat within a few days.I have other such (or similar) questions, but I will no longer bore you.  I just have a (bad) habit of over-analysing movies I really like.  In a few days, it will all be a distant memory.Despite how I feel about the negative aspects of the movie, the action and suspense were enough to cancel them out and more.

318,forrestwrs,Jurassic Park 3... getting close to the same category as Jaws 3...,4,31 May 2007,"While still no where near as bad as Jaws 3, I'd have to say that if they're not careful, the producers are going to have the Jurassic Park series go into B movie territory. This movie was a huge disappointment. I was only ten when I first saw this film, and even then I saw the major flaws in the movie.Firstly, WHY did the Spinosaurus kill the all-time classic character, the Tyranosaurus Rex? From that point on, I knew that this movie wasn't going to be anywhere near as good as the previous two movies. Then, I saw how hollow the plot was. Compared to Jurassic Park or even The Lost World, this movie seemed to have virtually nothing to it but surviving the dinosaurs. Couldn't they have gotten even a LITTLE creative? When I saw the film, I was expecting at least a little more blood shed. There were how many deaths? Five? And four of them were right in the beginning of the film! After that, there was nothing left to see except for to wait for Udesky to get killed. And did anyone else notice that having Billy actually survive the end of the film seemed very familiarly close to the ending of that all-time dud of a film Jaws the Revenge? There were several good points to the movie, though. Bringing the family closer and all that good stuff was okay, and doing more with the intelligence of the Velociraptors was a good idea.I said in my comments for both of the other Jurassic Park movies that CGI characters these days are nowhere near as good as they were for the original Jurassic Park and its first sequel, and here is a good example of what I meant. During the fight with the T-Rex, you can especially see the poor computer graphics in this movie.I am glad that these writers brought in the Pteranodons in the series at last. They had been in the original book, but you only got a glimpse of them in The Lost World.To be honest, this film still wasn't God-awful, but I have a feeling that Jurassic Park IV won't be much worth watching.",Jurassic Park III
319,eternalsea,The weakest of the saga,4,12 March 2006,"Jurassic Park 3 is simply by definition a big dumb fun monster movie. Whilst the previous installments had an air of intelligence around them this one is brainless but thats what you get when you choose the guy who directed Jumanji. The guy in question is Joe Johnston and in all fairness he makes a better movie than Jumanji this time round. Sam Neills character is returned to the Island by a bunch of parents who trick him into it, as they have lost there son over the Island in a para gliding accident. Grant the group then parade around the Island looking for the boy and dodging big nasty beasties. I loved the first film and enjoyed the second very much and while I had fun with Jurassic Park 3 I could not but help feel slightly disappointed. The acting is only ever adequate and the effects unsurprisingly don't seem as brilliant now due to the fact they are the same every blockbuster every week. Personally during the summer of 2001 I preferred Lara Croft Tomb Raider and whilst it has no more in the way of brain power it does have more exciting moments. Enjoy Jurassic Park 3 while you watch it but I doubt you will remember it for very long afterword.",Jurassic Park III
320,Lursa,No Surprises Here,5,23 July 2001,"Okay, I confess. I was rooting for the dinosaurs. I wanted Tea Leoni's character to get eaten so badly that...well, never mind.  There is nothing surprising or terrifying about the movie. The people who are destined to be dino fodder practically have a neon ""T"" (for TOAST!) emblazoned on their chests. The whole movie stretches the bounds of plausibility past the snapping point.  Okay, I'll buy an island full of chompy, growly dinosaurs...I'll even buy that someone would be so stupid as to let their son parasail around it, after all there are some REALLY stupid people in the world. But I don't buy that a man who barely escaped dinos once would go back for any amount of money. He KNOWS there are flying dinos, right? Oh, wait...maybe he didn't...maybe all that talk about bird behavior in the first Jurassic Park was just him blowing smoke. Ya think?Go see this movie is you don't mind a few ""B"" movie thrills and chills.",Jurassic Park III
321,Theshapeshifter,"Extinction should be, in this film's case, forever...",1,2 October 2005,"I have watched this film before and I can honestly say that when I had gone to see the film, I had high hopes of a great action plethora, and many plot twists, but my hopes were, in an instant, dashed to pieces. The film had a poor plot, with a weak set of characters.Alas, my hopes were crushed, as were a fair few people who had seen this film as well. This film revolves around dear Dr. Grant from the first film, who has taken on an assisting new student. They have been promised funding by a couple who wish to travel to the island. But all goes awry when some of the travelers interact with the fauna and make their way into troublesome matters, involving the 'raptors as usual, and some new (and substantially bothersome) predator, who performs an unforgivable act for Jurassic Park fans...With less action involving scientific theory, as was the original intent with the first films, and more action involving blind terror and chaos, as well as gaudy family moments which choked viewers with cheesy false sentiment, the film leaves little to the imagination. All in all, this film was very poor and very clearly the worst of the series.",Jurassic Park III
322,SnowLeopardMaster,Underappreciated movie,9,9 May 2018,"This movie got so much hate when it came out. And I understand why. The inclusion of the Spinosaurus replacing the T-Rex, and the overall premise.I do agree that the plot is kind of weak. Alan Grant was swayed into going on the island way to easily, and I can't think of a reason why. However, every other dumb thing about this movie has a cannon explanation of some form. The first thing that people seem to hate about this movie was the Spinosaurus. It was supposedly way to overpowered, and many fans hated this movie from the moment the Spinosaurus killed the T-Rex. But there is an explanation. Actually, two. The scientific one is that back in 2001, that was an accurate design of a Spinosaurus, as the only remains of it that they had back then showed that it was in fact a super powerful killing machine. The cannon explanation was that the Spinosaurus was not a real Spinosaurus, rather an experimental hybrid with Spinosaurus DNA. That explains all the overpowered stuff that it did.And an element of the movie that typically gets forgotten is the raptors. They were perfected in this movie, and their design was amazing. They looked awesome, and were really smart, with their one flaw being that they didn't open doors. This was also the movie that introduced non-dinosaurs to the franchise, with the pterandon aviary scene. That was one of the best scenes in the movie, and really suspenseful.The deaths weren't as great as in the past two. Only a handful of people died, and all of them in roughly the first half. None of the deaths were as spectacular or creative as in the lost world, with the possible exception of Udesky, but they were still enjoyable. All in all, a great but underrated movie.",Jurassic Park III
323,scotty-38,Oh no!!,3,27 July 2001,"Ok i enjoyed the first two Jurassic Park films very much, but when this one came to town i fell over dead. The effects are terrible. The acting is poor. The action sequences aren't nearly as exciting or as clever made as in the first two films. And the idea of convincing Grant (Sam Neill) to go back to the island for money is pitiful! What a dumb idea. I definitely suggest to avoid this movie and focus on Jurassic Park and The Lost World: Jurassic Park II. Avoid this one for sure.",Jurassic Park III

I mean, i'll admit that the second film was a bit of a different look into the Jurassic Park senario, but honestly this film was much worse!! For one thing, it's the shortest film i've ever sat through! You would think that since the first two films were quite long, that this film would be just as long. The whole idea about giving the raptors their eggs was pathetic! The REAL idea of going to the island at all was really dumb. And also... this movie is not directed by Spielberg! The first two films were! I really expected the third time to be a charm! Obviously it wasn't! What a disappointment! Please avoid this one!",Jurassic Park III
325,pulikd,Visiting the 2nd island for the 2nd time,5,26 July 2021,"As far as carnivore dinosaurs go, this ""Jurassic Park"" movie has a couple of significant additions. Only they can raise questions. A lot of attention is, once again, paid to raptors and for the third time in a row does this franchise use pouring rain at night. Herbivore dinosaurs are nearly ignored in the movie, and when they are on screen, they look significantly worse than the main carnivores. In general, this movie loses to the previous two in the visual effects arena. And as for the plot, it has never been this simple in the franchise. The first one has a story about a failed attempt to open a dinosaur theme park which results in a desperate fight for survival. The second one has a story about a failed attempt to transport dinosaurs to our world which results in a desperate fight for survival. This one has nothing but a fight for survival. And the detailed circumstances are better left without discussion because they are highly questionable.There is a kid here, and of all the kids in the franchise yet, this one is easily the best. He is smart and resourceful, and not in the slightest bit annoying. Some of the adults may be, though. The music reuses what the first movie came up with, and pretty much nothing new, nothing memorable. And the island itself, by the way, is supposed to be the one from the second movie, only the landscape and, especially, the vegetation, are way different.In conclusion, the third ""Jurassic Park"" fails to outshine either of the two before it, and does not even reach their level because the plot is much simpler, and not as rich in events, because the visual effects are weaker, and because it simply is a smaller movie. It is only an hour and a half long.",Jurassic Park III
326,OldRose,"""Sometimes the worst things happen based on the best intentions...!""",5,5 September 2001,"The tag-line (above) serves as theme: I was appalled to the point of disgust over just how AWFUL this film's story line really was. And herewith we'd been promised, finally, something of a 'human element', a story, something on which to grab as regards the people in this film. And quite simply, we were robbed.Instead, we find ourselves with even less of a feasible story line than in either I or II. We find some absolutely AWFUL miscasting in some of the key roles, and our heroes come down to the good professor once more (Sam Neill) without whom this series would have never survived, and only a brief appearance by his former working partner (Laura Dern), now moved on to other matters. Trevor Morgan and Alessandro Nivola provide some good supporting moments for Sam Neill, without which the film collapses entirely -- like just another flimsy protective barrier supposed to confine our dinosaurs in all three films.Macy and Leoni could NOT have found themselves more out of place than a pair of vampires on a Spring Break outing to Miami Beach. Both were misfits throughout the film, and provided reverse entertainment in that the audience was kept betting on how soon they'd be squashed by a careless roaming Dino on a Sunday stroll...Story line was non-existent. Plot development missing. Indeed, such could have been assembled over coffee and croissants by amateur university film students with far better results. The only thing missing was shaking cameras, as in the original BLAIR WITCH PROJECT (which was far more original). From opening premise to closing escape we are left wishing Hollywood could ""wake-up and smell the coffee"": not all films need a target market of ages 8-14, and that's about where this film falls.
Sacrificed is quality time viewing the marvellous animation effects of the creatures themselves, a primary reason for viewing these films given the gross departure from the Michael Crichton novel. Films I and II would manage 3 stars each (on five), but this third endeavour garners only 2 stars on pure generosity alone. Do NOT pay money to see this; cable will get it soon enough.",Jurassic Park III
327,NEFARlOUS,Not as awful as the second half of II,10,26 July 2001,"This film succeeds at being what it intends to be, an exciting, well-filmed yarn without the usual sort of filler that was present in the first two.Don't get me wrong - Sam Neil's American accent is still irritating, the plot is rather silly and many of the dinosaurs portrayed are completely and deliberately wrong. (more on this later)The good bits? - There's only one kid in this, and he is less annoying then either of the two from the first film. There is a greater attempt to portray the Dinosaurs as the stars, which is how it should be - If you want to watch Sam act, watch something like ""a death in Brunswick"" or ""The Piano"".The set pieces were done very well, particularly the carnosaur-carnosaur fight and the way in which the Velociraptors were not simply shown as cartoon villains worthy of moustaches, but rather behaving like intelligent predators.On to the aforementioned deliberate mistakes with the dinosaurs:1) The Spinosaurus Egypticus - Roughly the size of a T-rex, NOT noticably bigger, the sail indicated a cold-blooded animal, as such the idea that it could despatch a similarly sized and protected hot-blooded animal (theT-rex) when the T-rex had more advanced teeth (serrated, larger sockets in the jawline for more muscle power/bite) and would be able to move and react a lot quicker is a tad laughable.2) A full-grown Velociraptor stood a decidedly less-impressive three feet high weighing at most 15kgs. Rather different than portrayed in the entire trilogy. What they did get right is the large brain/body-size ratio making the Dromaeosaurid family (to which it belongs) up to three times smarter than the smartest T-rex. What they should have done from the outset is show Deinonychus, the Velociraptor's bigger cousin standing over five feet tall and weighing 80 kilos. This dinosaur was so advanced that some paleontologists believe it may have had primitive feathers. The biggest dinosaur in this species was the Utahraptor (no prizes for guessing where it came from) at around Twelve feet high and weighing close to a ton.3) Pteradons (the flying creatures represented) weighed about 35 pounds, could not have even lifted the kid in the picture, were far more lightly built and a full grown man could easily have crushed the neck of one. Incidentally, all Pterodactyloids were reptiles, not dinosaurs!Food for thought - Glad that the series has generated so much interest in the subject!",Jurassic Park III
328,cartman_1337,Pure entertainment!,6,14 August 2001,"It's got dinosaurs, it's got action, it's got nerve, what more do you need? On top of that, it's got some pretty good acting (and some *not* quite so good - shit happens) and some great music in the style of the original music. Deduct a couple of points for a terrible ending for what is otherwise a quite good and effective story, and you end up with a purely entertaining movie, worthy of my vote for 7/10.

330,robh,Plot holes but watchable,7,13 February 2002,"I'll come to the plot holes in a moment, but the biggest problem with this film is the ending. It's a huge anti-climax which arrives abruptly, leaving you thinking, is that it ?, did they run out of special effects money or something ?.Talking of money, I guess it must be much cheaper to do CGI in the dark than in well lit daytime scenes. Far too many monster and horror films end up in near darkness.So to the plot holes (well some of them), and inevitably there will be SPOILERS!.The flying dinosaurs (terradactyls ?) are meant to be ""new"" to this film, and in the DVD extras one of the filmmakers even describes them as hidden up until now. They're supposed to be trapped in a huge ""birdcage"", yet we've already seen them at the end of JP2.How big is that island ?. The new super-predator is a T-Rex killer that we're told is attracted to T-Rex scent.  You'd think he'd have wiped out all the T-Rexes in all the years they've been there.Despite all the negatives, if you can put your brain into neutral the film can be exciting and fun, just don't expect much of a finish.",Jurassic Park III

Jurassic Park II was just a monster movie while this one actually had dinosaurs doing neat things and had more of the original sense of wonder with it.  The story wasn't great and had some plot holes but still stood up pretty well.  The action, the dinos were just brilliant.  I loved looking at the intelligent raptors and the pterosaurs were the best!One thing though - I wish they had less cheesy human parts (particularly at the end) and more dinos!!!",Jurassic Park III
332,Incendid,Not horrible but way below average.,4,1 November 2013,"Bob the film Guy: I am just going to get out of the way what I think is good about this movie. The developments with Grant's character is really good, the CGI occasionally looked impressive, one or two of the animatronics looked good, the action sequence with the flying pteranodons is great, maybe one or two jokes work... and that is it. To be completely honest this is a movie that I grew up with but now I almost completely hate it. It's lazy, it doesn't take much risks (with the story/characters) and the risks that are taken are insulting, nothing really Happens, yet there is a lot to talk about. It's a rehashed story with uninteresting characters. It can be described as a perfect train-wreck. My first main issue is that the story and characters are lazily written. The basic story is a rescue mission that runs for 90 minutes. It's a bad sign when a movie has such a sickeningly simple story, underdeveloped characters and 3 writers. It could have worked as it's own individual movie but not as a Jurassic Park movie. It took the B-movie route like the Jaws series and didn't care about continuing the story thus making the film feel like a dumb special effect cash cow. The rest of the characters are forgettable, expendable, annoying and pointless. There is even an attempt to make you feel sorry for one character after he supposedly dies. This doesn't work because we aren't given much detail about the character or what his personality is like. Suddenly, he is brought back from the dead... what was the point? A lot of people who do like this movie compare it the first two saying, ""The other two took themselves too seriously and this was some good B-movie fun!"" The first two were so good because of their themes and creative ideas and this one just doesn't care and goes for goofy rental action movie. It borrows so much imagery and plot devices from the first two and it's painful. It isn't horrible as a movie, I just can't enjoy it. 4/10Ciaran's Review: Jurassic Park 3 almost ruined the entire Jurassic Park series for me. How? Well the movie was just cheap, with a pathetic excuse for a story and a wide range of 'new' dinosaurs to lure audiences in. I believe that after about 30 minutes or so the movie knew the story was fading and so multiple references are made referring back to the original film. The CGI is decent but not brilliant, Grant's character development is good and some jokes are funny- but the movie is ruined by dumb action scenes. Whenever i ask someone how they would rate all the Jurassic Park movies usually JP3 comes in with the second highest rating- this always disgusts me. Many people say JP3 is better because it contains more dinosaurs and has better action scenes... People like Spinosaurus over T-Rex rampaging through San Diego...Ladies and Gentlemen the world has gone mad. As i said before i despise this movie as it almost ruined the previous two Jurassic Park films. Jurassic Park 3 in my opinion is a sin on the dinosaur movie community.

334,robo8,An excuse to milk CGI:nasours,4,10 January 2007,"I read that this movie contained a lot of left over ideas from the previous ones. That's really what it feels like. The story really is nothing but an excuse for the characters to walk through a string of dinosaur action scenes.In a few scenes it flirts a little with the imagination teasing imagery-ride you were brought on in the first ""instalment"". But that is all that's left of the legacy, flirts with what was. This is a monster flick; people get into a situation (whether it be dinosaurs or zombies) and then spend the rest of the movie being chased through action sequences 'til the end. And of course they had to invent an even bigger and badder baddie than the previous T-rex.The only thing teasing your imagination in this one is whether there's gonna be something remotely original (the answer unfortunately is no). They make the same mistake as so many other movies in the genre, focus is on the ""monsters"" and on action shots. Characters remain shallow and story oh so thin. This just doesn't make you buy into the emotions along the ride. Another mistake is killing of to many of the side characters in the start of the movie (the mercenaries). They could have added an interesting dimension.So, this turns out as a rather flat movie. The upsides are that Sam Neill and William H Macy has some charisma (however untapped in this one). Also the amazing score, composed by John Williams for the first one, lifts a couple of the few non-action scenes.",Jurassic Park III
335,ShannonAmidala,Extremely disappointing **possible spoilers**,4,23 July 2001,"After witnessing the brilliant creativity, action-packed first movie, the considerably worse second movie, and now this movie, I now realize why everyone despises sequels and their follow-ups. The third volume of the dinosaur thriller really is quite disappointing. Even though I wasn't expecting much out of it, as I've heard the second and third movies are usually really bad compared to their predecessor, I still came out saying, ""That doesn't deserve to be a movie.""One factor which I think played a part for why I didn't like it as much as the first two was the switch in direction. Steven Spielburg gave the reins to his production cohort, Joe Johnston. Now, while Johnston did a fairly good job for someone who was taking over a large movie franchise empire, there was too much riding on this movie that even Spielburg could fix to make ""perfect"". But, I think the final outcome would have been considerably better than Johnston's version. No offense to Joe Johnston.Another fact was the lack of plot. Not only was there no creative genius theory as there was in the first one, this movie had no real plot. Unless you call two divorced people looking for their son on Isla Sorna and getting involved with dinosaurs a plot. The movie was just non-stop action. Which is ok if you like that kind of stuff. But for me, I need a ""method behind the madness"" type of influence. I can't just see lots of running around, lots of dinosaur chases, and lots of worried faces and expect to walk out of the theater with a satisfied grin. Perfect example: The Matrix. There is a lot of heavy metal warfare, lots of chase scenes and action, but the movie really has great theoretical support from Andy and Larry (Wachowski), who came up with the mind behind it. I think they could have expanded upon the fact that the dinosaurs can talk to each other, thus drawing out the creative genius portion of the movie.I was very disappointed with this movie. Minimal action, practically no deaths, and a thin plot line. Hopefully Jurassic Park IV will be better. <rolleyes>",Jurassic Park III
336,adam_uk09,It has just about enough meat!,7,26 July 2007,"The 3rd instalment of Steven Spielberg's lucrative franchise has not been as awaited as the 2nd, partly due to the failings of that first sequel. Unsurprisingly, Spielberg has ditched the franchise and passed the leash of it onto Joe Johnston who directed the uninspiring 'Jumanji.' Was this a good decision? Let's find out.OK so we haven't got off to the best start, a director who doesn't exactly have excellent film history really doesn't help things, however, in comparison to some of this years blockbusters, it is just about average. Jurassic Park 3 throws up a few surprises which is its saving grace.A nice touch is the return of Laura Dern as Ellie Sattler, being a supremely popular character in the first film, it was practically inevitable for her return, though her character is a little scarce on the ground for our liking. Sam Neill as Dr. Alan Grant makes a predictable reappearance.The story is adequate to keep audiences sustained through an exceptionally short running time of just 83 minutes. The words too short spring to mind even before watching the film, and this is even more evident at the finale.A short, but well shot introduction gives us an insight into the separate characters lives as well as providing the basis for the whole film itself. This is a clear-cut no nonsense action movie, all well and good but it means the movie lacks the witty, humorous dialogue that made the previous two films so different and enjoyable, that's not to say Jurassic Park 3 doesn't have it moments, but they are scarce.William H Macy and Tea Leoni star beside Sam Neill and Alessandro Nivola along with an array of other forgettable characters that one by one are picked off by the dinos. The acting is adequate rather than inspired but all the characters give likable performances, especially Nivola who plays his character with a much needed cautious approach and provides us with some of the movies most hair-raising and enjoyable moments.Casting is one of the fundamental flaws in this film, Leoni is simply not right for this type of movie and her clumsy character only makes the films serious feel deteriorate as it progresses, she struggles to keep up pace with the other actors. It is a shame she is not picked off as lunch. Sam Neill provides us with a very watered down Alan Grant and his performance is severely lacking for a lead role.When people think of Jurassic Park, they think of excellent special effects; this is true to an extent, the CGI remains unrivalled but the animatronics feel very much like leftovers and lack the realistic movements of their predecessors. Jurassic Park fans are going to be disappointed.From the director of 'Jumanji', a childish storyline is expected, so this is not such a concern, but even so, some of the decisions the adults make are ridiculous, leaving us most definitely; rooting for the dinosaurs. Jurassic Park 3 does have some excellent and very memorable scenes however, the giant bird cage is exceptionally entertaining and brings back the Jurassic Park feel to the film. The finale is good, but a little short, though this is just a minor consideration that doesn't need to be taken into account.The saving grace of this film is the story's unpredictability, keeping the audience guessing right until the very end. It may be a little thin on the ground, but it is unpredictable nevertheless. Jurassic Park 3 is a good way to pass the time, but not a strong film on any basis. It lacks the story and in depth characters of the previous two films and will also leave audiences feeling short changed. One can only wonder how great this film could've been if Steven Spielberg had returned to the helm of this franchise. An efficient but soulless film.It just has about enough meat to get your teeth stuck into and enough to keep the franchise going a little longer. JP 4? Yes please, but only if Steven Spielberg is directing.",Jurassic Park III
337,epsilon3,Worth a watch,5,8 March 2002,"Jurassic Park 3 isn't a bad film - it's just tired. We've seen it all before - the cool special effects, the nasty dinosaurs that have a malign intelligence, the contrived plot (oh look - I swore I'd never return to a dinosaur infested island, but I'm here again facing almost certain death. Silly me!)Yes, all the bad things about sequels are here. This is a 100% cash-in.Despite that, if you like popcorn movies, it's actually quite good. It doesn't matter that the characters run around aimlessly from action set-piece to action set-piece. Don't trouble yourself with the fact that if there really was an island infested with man eating dinosaurs, government scientists and the military would have the whole thing secured for research.

As an aside, these men are described as professional mercenaries.

Or like their son were they selfish, spoiled people who want what they want right now without ever considering the consequences ?One can clearly see that the root cause of the entire project was a fat paycheck.

Instead of suspense mixed with humor, we get a cheap monster chase flick with a (very annoying) divorced couple looking for their kid thrown in.The plot is very thin and the 'story' is only there to get everyone to the dinosaur island as quickly as possible. The real gem is professor Grant who declares early in the movie he would not go back to the islands 'for anything in the world'. Moments later he gets offered hard cash from Mr. Kirby (the male part of the couple) and decides instantly to join them on the plain to go back..? So anything in the world did not include cash? On the island everything goes wrong quickly and there are some good action scenes but they are very short and they get interrupted by 'family stuff' of the divorced couple. There is one good dinosaur scene when the group is attacked by flying Terradon's but the characters are so shallow and underdeveloped that you don't care for them at that point.So this is just bad and has almost nothing in common with the very good first film, except for Sam Neill who did a descent job.

340,mlong-5,Fun mindless flick,8,12 January 2002,This movie does not have much of a plot. It's just an excuse to get people back on an island full of dinosaurs and have them being terrorized by them. THis isn't as good as the first two movies but it's still alot of fun to watch. The dinosaurs seem a bit cheesy this time around and sometimes they look awesome. I dont know how they got a decorated actor like William H. Macy to be in this dumb flick but he's very good in it. The action is cool in this movie and alot of it is exciting. The movie is based on a dinosaur theory which makes it better because at least the writers tried to put some educational stuff in the film.

341,SanderStrijbos,"Big, fun popcorn thrill-ride (SPOILERS)",8,2 August 2001,"I saw the movie last night and it was better then one should expect from a third part of sequel. It has its thrills and fun and is probably one of the best examples this year of mindless fun.Jurassic Park 3 starts of with a young boy who's paragliding near Isla Sorna (Site B from JP2: The Lost World). He crashes down and his parents start looking for him. They hire Alan Grant who knows the dino's best to guide them through the island. Billy, Alan's protegé, and three mercenaries come along with them. Of course, the plane crashes and we're back in the good old world of 'Oh and ah, but soon it'll be running and screaming.'What can I say? I liked the film very much. Of course there werre flaws, but I'll get to them soon.What was great? The actors were fantastic in their roles. Sam Neill and Laura Dern act like they never and the new people (William H. Macy, Téa Leoni, Alessandro Nivola) are perfect added in the JP-franchise. The script was good enough, not pretending to be more than it is: a big popcorn flick. The dino's... The dino's were (as always) awesome!!! The Spinosaurus who kills the T-Rex in the first half hour, the raptors with their 'new' intelligence and the pterodactycles (is this written right?) are just breath-taking CGI. The pacing of the film was perfect. Johnston introduces us to the characters in the first 20 minutes and then... WHAM! We're in the middle of the action and we never get out until the end credits. Joe Johnston is a perfect replacement for Spielberg (who disappointed us all with JP2: The Lost World a bit). Another cool thing was bringing in the birdcage, which also featured in the original Jurassic Park-novel by Michael Crichton. Remember they did the same thing with the waterfall in The Lost World.Now then: what was not so great? First of all: the length of the film: 88 minutes. All those screenwriters (most of them uncredited) couldn't come up with something more? One big final battle? Which leads us directly to the ending, which is too quick. Another thing: the three mercenaries die too quickly. If they lived a little longer, we could know them better and decide to care or not care if they died, but now they die so quickly that we don't.Then there were three things I liked to see in the movie, but which weren't in it: - Paul and Amanda Kirby visiting Ian Malcolm who refuses to go back with them (since he was the one who actually was on Isla Nublar, Alan wasn't) - The film should've take place on Isla Sorna, the original Island. It would make it more believable that they actually hired Grant for the mission and it could provide some cool scenes with Alan revisiting some good old places like the Tyrannosaur-paddock. - The ending. When Alan calls Ellie, it would've been cool if Ellie called John Hammond immediately. He has far more influence than she has and it would make it even more believable when all those marines show up.Despite these flaws, I really enjoyed the movie and rate it a 8/10.",Jurassic Park III
342,jdoan-4,Raptors with walkie-talkies,4,8 April 2006,"A film can be fun and purely entertaining without being serious. This is not that film. There are many good special effects, though nothing that we haven't seen before. The plot is very predictable and silly by any standards. It is all pretty standard, and that means it is absurd. The filmmakers don't have the guts to go completely over the top, i.e. ""Tremors"", and what we get is pretty ridiculous. Sometimes it is funny accidentally, but not often. I would have been happy with even a few more incidental laughs. The acting is sub par. With all the good actors, you would think they could do something with the plot, but they don't. Not even a genius could sculpt a David out of a pile of crap. I don't expect JPIV to be much different.",Jurassic Park III

Have the other (negative) contributors to this site ever seen the second sequel of a movie before?  What on Earth where they expecting?  How can you watch a second sequel without possessing the lowest entertainment threshold imagineable; especially after the mess that was The Lost World - gripping first half/ludicrous second!JP3 is a total load of old hokum!  And there is no point in the movie where it suggests it is anything else: For God's sake - it even introduces a made up dinosaur!  So what JP3 sets out to do is cram as many moments of giant reptilian action as it can into the longest allowable time (90 mins is probably spot on) and over the kind of cliched, unobtrusive plot that won't get in the way.  And anyone who even possesses the temerity to question plot or narrative flaws really should seek out counselling:  IT'S A FILM ABOUT DINOSAUR'S SUNBATHING IN COSTA RICA!!!!  And it's a very enjoyable film. It's not as overblown as Johnston's Jumanji and it has the added bonus of the marvellous William H Macy.  If you want to see a profound, literate movie - AVOID THIS.

It is by no means a real sequel - there is not the same characterisation or plot depth as the two originals - but it is an enjoyable experience in its own right.Sam Neill returns as Dr Grant, promising never to return to the islands inhabited by dinosaurs, but lured back by William H. Macy and Tia Leone as a couple seeking a guide on a fly-over.  All is not as it seems however, and, of course, things start to go wrong and people start to get eaten soon thereafter.There are some genuine comic moments, including a few references back to the first two films, and some reasonably scary moments.The problems - in typical mainstream style you know who's going to get gobbled and who's going to make it, and, although the effects are good, the 'magic' of the first film is gone in that we've seen it all before.

And now, we are on to thisIf you haven't seen my other Jurassic Park reviews, I like the first, I find the second hilarious and I find the third one....WHAT THE HECK HAPPENED!! How, HOW was this even made!. This is one of those movies that is impressively bad. And its not even funny bad, its just a horrible experience to have to sit through. So now I will explain this experience to you now.First lets start off with the characters, all of the characters from the previous movies are now just bland and generic hero characters, and the new characters are just unbearable at times with how idiotic they are. Oh, and the acting is also terrible.The effects were actually good at first but then later on they also messed that up by making the dinosaurs seem like stretchy rubber action figures. I do appreciate that they did use practical effects a number of times. It doesn't make up for the terrible characters but its a plus.Some of the events and scenarios don't even make sense. Like when one of the dinosaurs ate one of the characters phones (don't ask) and when the dinosaur comes back when they don't notice him (even though he is a dinosaur, which means when he steps he creates vibrations and they didn't even notice tha- I MEAN SERIOUSLY!!) and they finally notice him because the phone starts ringing in his stomach.. There are many other nonsensical moments in the movie I could make fun of but if we did that we would be here for days.Just.Just stay far away from this movie. And I have to unfortunately have since I bought the Jurassic Park trilogy not knowing about 2 and 3, which means I get to have the really good movie along with the other two massive train-wrecks. Yay.Final Score: 3/10",Jurassic Park III

349,sumankumarganguly-454-264875,"Triple the Terror, Triple the Excitement!",8,21 May 2013,"(Reviewed on the basis of watching on video 12 years after release)Plot: Allan Grant accompanies a rescue team onto Isla Sorna to look for a lost kid. But soon after they land on the island, their plane gets destroyed in an accident. Will they find the boy; and more importantly will they be able to safely get off this dangerous island?Review: After directing the first two blockbusters of this money- spinning franchise, Steven Spielberg decided to hand over the reigns to his protégé Joe Johnston for the third installment. Neither was Michael Crichton commissioned to write another novel to form the basic premise of this film. Although his unforgettable themes are still present, but even the maestro John Williams also vacated his place. So, does the magic diminish? Certainly not!'Jurassic Park III' is clearly intended to be just a terror experience; which could be the reason for Spielberg opting out, who generally specializes in life-altering cinematic creations. Yet, considering 'The Lost World' had failed to meet his towering standards; JPIII with less expectation doesn't do badly at all. The scenario here is grimmer; the arrivers fewer and less resourceful and the time spent on the island the maximum. All this contributes into building a sense of heightened danger making it the most terrifying film of this franchise.JPIII has a running time of just 90 minutes; unlike its prequels which were nearly 130 minutes long. Although that severely cuts down on the fun; it's still better than TLW where not much happened despite a longer duration. At least to compensate for it, the real 'fun' (struggle for survival) begins much earlier than the previous two. Due to its length the story never gets the scope to expand and clearly the script isn't the strength of this flick; unlike the prequels. That's the difference between adapting a literary work and manufacturing a screenplay.Although the script borrows some of the many unused sequences from Crichton's previous novels, why couldn't the run-time be extended by incorporating more such scenes is beyond me. There are a couple of doubts in the plot; but those aren't gaping loopholes like in TLW.One interesting aspect of this franchise has been the discussions among the central characters which are often as engaging as the thrills. JPIII doesn't disappoint on this front either, as there are quite a few engrossing conversations among the leads often laced with the characteristic humor. Ironically,one of the main points of interest in this film was the intelligence of Raptors. But disappointingly the Raptors hardly inject the same amount of terror this time. With the T- Rex only making a cameo appearance, two of the most feared dinosaurs of the franchise hardly create an impression here.But impression is certainly created by the newcomers and previous side- players. The Spinosaurus replaces the T-Rex as the chief-terrorist of this film. Not only does it vanquish a T-Rex to assert its superiority; it swoops down on its prey to crash the visitors flight and then literally crushes it into a piece of log, it breaks through a wooden fence and even swims underwater to wreck the survivors' boat. Needless to say all these sequences are nerve-wracking! But special mention has to be made of the Pteranodon which till now only featured in the concluding scene of the two prequels. Even here it repeats its act by soaring into the clouds to create the most beautiful ending of this franchise. But it also finally gets the opportunity to show its 'talent' in the terrific bird-cage sequence. It's easily the highlight of this film.But more than the dinosaurs, the heart & soul of JPIII is the one & only Sam Neill as Allan Grant, who was sorely missed in TLW. Returning eight years after he stole our hearts in Jurassic Park; he looks a bit aged but still retaining the same old charm and aura of dependability. Wearing his trade-mark hat he delivers some of the funniest lines with a straight face; and with the same expression he stands composed in the face of extreme danger. With his large eyes which speak volumes, he scans not only the hidden dangers present in the surroundings but also the hidden truths in the human minds. He once again becomes the epitome of dependence, the lone hope for the survivors to escape these creatures. This was exactly what Jeff Goldblum, as Ian Malcolm lacked in TLW. Neill single-handedly raises the bar a few notches for this film; as without him there are doubts if this film would have worked at all. Trevor Morgan as Eric, who reminds of a certain Daniel Radcliff, impresses by putting in a performance more matured than his age.JPIII would always remain special to me, as despite being the last film of the franchise till date, it was the first film of the trilogy which I had the fortune to witness. Watching captivated in a theatre, I still remember the sequences which had captured my imagination some 12 years back. Ironically, the dream sequence in the plane was my first introduction with a dinosaur sending a momentary chill down my spine! But the sight of 'real' dinosaurs scurrying in herds beneath the plane generated a gasp of 'dinosaurs!' from my wide-opened mouth. Similarly, the scene of the Spinosaurus staring from the woods, with the ring-tone of a satellite phone in the backdrop; made for a really eerie feeling. Last but not the least, the spectacle of the herds of Brachiosaurus staring down from the skies, remains my favorite scene from the film; just like the similar classic sequence from JP.'Jurassic Park III' as a cinematic experience doesn't come anywhere near 'Jurassic Park'. But as a terror movie it certainly fulfills its objectives better than 'The Lost World'. Only one request to the makers of 'Jurassic Park 4'; please get Sam Neill back, even if he is 66 at that time!",Jurassic Park III

I obviously wasn't going to be, especially after the atrociously horrible second one (to which I gave 1/10, for reference).Why would anyone say that this is worst than the second one? Did they actually see the movies? Watch them back to back - I dare you - watch them back to back, and when watching this one, I bet you will feel a surge of relief that this one is actually decent, whilst the second one makes you want to... well, makes you want to turn it off as fast as possible. If you can sit through the whole of the second one, I'm willing to bet you that, as with me, you will feel a great deal of pain.Ok, so in this one there is a certain amount of non-science (as in the first one - velociraptors are actually quite small, and covered in feathers). Ok, so there are a few things that make you go ""hunh?"" - they are nothing compared to the major gaping plot holes that exist in the second one. No, it's not a masterpiece, no it's not the first one, but you know what? It's fun, it's got good action, decent acting, the script actually holds together (unlike the second one). I don't know why some people rant saying that it doesn't - dear god, and the second one does? And let's admit that even in the first one, having a single, sketchy fat guy who complains about not being paid enough as the only person working with security systems, debugging, etc. is not InGen's finest idea, and could be seen as weakness in the plot.I'll stop ranting, and I'll stop comparing it to the other ones. Let's just put it this way ; this film is an adventurous, action packed, basic Hollywood movie, with some good humour, decently well made, and if you expect more from it (the third in a series that grossed millions, of which the second was a fiasco), then don't watch it. But if you want a movie that's simply fun, easy to follow, and brings you back into the universe of Jurassic Park, this film does it quite well.",Jurassic Park III

The plot was simply this. A kid got lost on Site B and he has been missing for 8 weeks. SPOILERS!

It could have been so much more. It was entertaining, this cannot be doubted, if a little predictable. I had heard it was a little more gory than the original (let's forget the sequel) but I have to say that I must have missed it. The velociraptors were back, this time talking to one another no less. Sam Neill tries valiantly to make this more than an obvious cashing in exercise but fails nonetheless. The arrival of pterodactyls was welcome and were strangely absent from the first episode. Little to make you jump or smile or cry or frown. Looks pretty but you get the feeling that maybe this cash cow should finally be put out to pasture after a lifetime of dedicated service. It boils down to being just some more dinosaurs in a plethora of movies depicting much the same thing. The original was so successful because of it's FX and originality, at the height of public interest in all things genetic.

Having said that it contains virtually no plot or decent acting and yet is still one of the most enjoyable action sci fi films out there. That is of course assuming you are a dinosaur nut otherwise why else would you be reading this? I don't really follow the plots in these films but even to me the severe lack of any decent narrative stuck out like a Spinosaurus sail. It makes up for it in spades with some memorable set pieces such as the huge T Rex and Spinosaurus fight. The Rex looses which in the JP world could be described as a huge twist. Then there is the creepiness of the bird cage. The decision to make the raptors in to some sort of ultra brainy super villain didn't sit well with me. I didn't like the ""conversation"" bit right at the end one bit. There is sci fi, and then there is taking sci fi into the realms of the ridiculous. I've never really liked the focus on the raptors though. The T Rex was always the star of the show as far as I was concerned.On the point of the ending. WTF? They walk out on the beach and BANG!

360,raptor_2,"Good and fun, though less acurate, entry in the great Dino Series.",7,8 August 2001,"*Warning: Contains Spoilers*Here we are at entry number three in the fun, and often critically maligned, Jurassic Park series.  And though this may be the least scientifically accurate one, it is still a great, short blast of fun.Following the legendary Jurassic Park and the critically panned The Lost World: Jurasssic Park (my personal favorite in the series), Joe Johnston directs this short, quickly paced, and very fun dinosaur movie.  With an okay premise, simple and understandable characters, and the always excellent presence of Sam Neil and William H. Macy, Johnston directs the movie like a good old fashioned Ray Harryhausen film.The story takes place after Isla Sorna (Site B) has been made public, and the world knows dinosaurs are now alive and well.  And of course, like anything interesting and extremely dangerous, stupid tourists want to see them!  Such is the case when the son (Trevor Morgan) of a divorced couple (Macy and Tea Leoni) goes sailing around Isla Nublar with his mom's new boyfriend.  Naturally, as is the case of anyone going near dinosaurs or trying to videotape Godzilla, they end up getting stranded on the island. Talk about bang for your buck.Enter Alan Grant.  Still digging in the hot Bad Lands for fossils, he's strapped for grant money.  So Macy and Leoni ask him to be a ""tour guide"" while they fly over Site B, never mentioning their true intentions of landing and looking for their son.So, despite the best of common sense from Grant, the plane lands, is attacked, and you've got a few really unlucky people on ""the worst place in the world"".The film moves quickly, and is about 20-30 minutes shorter than the previous two.  I preffered the more dramatic aspects of the series, but I loved the atmosphere of quick adventure and fun this movie brings.  It works in a Ray Harryhausen kind of way.As a dinosaur enthusiast, I'm also glad to see more dinosaurs (though I still love T-Rex more than anything but Allosaurus).  We get Pteranodons (NOT pterodactyls!), a quick cameo of what I'm pretty sure is a Ceratasaurus, and the well hyped Spinosaurus.The scenes with these dinosaurs are excellent (even though the Ceratosaurus bit is really just a joke).  The Pteranodons attack, the Spinosaurus's introduction and finale, all are very tense and executed well on screen.However, there are, naturally, some setbacks.  And if any of you say plot holes and characterization, go watch American Beauty.  This is a dinosaur action movie damnit, not a serious drama!The main problem for me is that the suspense is somewhat killed when a 40 foot long dinosaur can't catch up to a group of mindlessly scrabbling humans.  That's what, among other things, I loved about the Lost World: lots more dinosaur food.  They manage to stay far ahead of the Spinosaurus (except on water), and it loses its thrill.  Luckily, this doesn't happen in any scene with the pteranodons and the velociraptors.Which, however, is another problem.  Although the T-Rex is traded in for the Spinosaurus, the velociraptors are abundent, which is the problem.  We've seen plenty of the velociraptors in the previous two, and trying to make them more intelligent and altering their looks for this outing just doesn't cut it.  I would suggest more of the aforemention ceratosaurus.But my big complaints is really just nit-picking scientific details, so its nothing big.  The fact is that this movie is really quite less acurate to common theories on dinosaurs than the previous two.  For one thing, i doubt a Pteranodon would go after something so large as a human when its mouth is designed to catch fish, or feed an healthy teenager to its young.
And for the hyped up Spino vs. T-Rex fight, the Rex would've one easily. While the Spino is bigger than the Rex, its only by about 4 feet in length. And while the Spino did have a longer head and bigger hands, it was much more lightly built than a Rex or even an allosaurus.  Its teeth weren't designed for taking down large, struggling prey, its jaws were weakers, and the Spinosaurus's trademark spine is a giant weakness.  It would have been easily damaged during a fight with any large prey.  The Rex was more muscular, had teeth and a jaw designed to crush bone, binocular vision, excellent sense of smell, and a brain twice the size of the Spinosaurs, Acrocanthosaurus, or Giganotasaurus.  Spino was just there because it looked cool.Still, the fight was cool, but not up to anything Ray Harryhausen has done.
Overall, this is a well, but not excellently, made diosaur action movie. And just the words ""Dinosaur Movie"" make me want to see it again.  I'd give it 3 1/2 out of 5 stars.",Jurassic Park III

363,chets808,It's Dino-mite !!!,7,26 July 2001,"No spoilers. Why ? Because we love you....Well, it may not be the next Star Wars but I was reminded of a certain early 80s adventure movie with Harry Ford. JP3 is a great summer thrill ride, with no real turn-offs both in acting and wrting. Joe Johnstone and the Dinos do a splendid job keeping the pace and keeping you interested, in fact, I'd say Sam Niel was better in 3 than he was in 1.Maybe it was the fact that their is only one child in this movie, but he acts like an adult so there is no real this-is-a-kiddie-movie backlash.
There was also a lack of the hokey-ness that plagued the previous two movies, more so on #2 than on #1. All in all, I'd say this was a very well done summer action flick, perfect for a little escapism. If I had any qualms about JP3, I'd say it was probably a little short, and others have agreed. You don't hear that said about many movies these days with the trend towards overblown affairs (Pearl Harbore). It could be construed as a compliment.The ending of the movie definitely leaves it open for sequels just as the previous versions have done, and can you blame Universal ? They know a good money maker when they see it. With technology progressing the way it does so rapidly, by the time JP4 comes out, we'll all be able to render a T-Rex on our Dell powerbooks !",Jurassic Park III
364,votesmall,Why the hate? WAY better than The Lost World,10,16 November 2011,"The original Jurassic Park paved the way for CGI and anamatronics, also bringing several actors to light. The story, acting, writing, and special effects are all superb. An edge of your seat adventure film with amazing twists and character development. The sequel, eh, not so much. David Koepp did a terrible job writing the screenplay. I couldn't care less about the dialogue, it was all boring and stupid, poorly misconstructed ""facts"". Second of all, the characters couldn't be more unlikeable. The characters are all annoying, especially the know-it-all Sarah Harding, and the only ones that aren't are Dr. Ian Malcom, his daughter, Eddie Carr, and Roland Tembo. Everyone else is hopelessly boring and annoying. Not to mention that the main characters (partictularly Sarah Harding and Nick Van Owen) are responsible for nearly every death in the movie. They steal bullets from the people who saved their lives to protect the dinosaurs that tried to kill them multiple times. And they also unleash vicious dinosaurs on their camp, killing who knows how many people, but that's okay, they just wanted to make sure the dinosaurs weren't put in a zoo! Who cares how many people die! And also, Sarah and Nick are always saying that you can't ""disrupt their environment"", and proceed to steal a young t-rex and mend its leg. Rightfully so, they are pushed off a cliff. But the effects and most of the acting is still pretty awesome, and to its effect, the movie is still pretty good. But enough about that one, now let's get to JPIII. I honestly can't understand why people hated this movie so much. This film is a very fun thrill ride, that I loved. How can people love the first sequel more than this one? Just because Spielberg directed? In this one, Spielberg isn't in it, but people automatically shun it or blame the film's flaws on the director because of that. And that isn't fair. Sure, this movie has flaws, but it isn't as bad as I thought it was going to be. For example, chief amounts of criticism are drawn towards the fact that the t-rex is killed off by a much scarier and stronger dinosaur. Because the t-rex was the big guy in the last two installments, people have shut their minds so they will accept no less than the t-rex, when there are thousands of other potential candidates. Why are people so close-minded? Okay, the Spinosaurus is faster, stronger, more agile, bigger, and stronger than the t-rex. Not to mention the fact that it has a larger bite radius and arms that it can actually use. In reality, the Spinosaurus is just a better dinosaur and killer, but people feel the need to pick at every last detail, when, in reality, this is an awesome movie and one of the biggest blockbusters of all time. Also, there was one reviewer who stated that it was ""predictable"" when they were attacked in the InGen lab. Well, DUH! It was foreshadowed! It actually showed a raptor running into the building! Besides, it isn't the director's fault that the movie was predictable! Again, because he isn't Spielberg, it won't do. I do have a few problems with this though, but only two major ones. * The raptors can TALK to each other. Okay, as much as I love the raptors, thinking that they have developed a language is absurd. Although it is original, the idea makes absolutely NO sense and therefore bugs me more than anything. * The Pteranodons fly away from the island at the end because (The 'burbs reference here, ""Someone left the gate open"".) Although these prehistoric reptilian clones tried to kill them all savagely, and when they reach civilization, will most likely create a nesting ground and will kill more innocent people, do these people care? No. And do they tell the military who is with them? No. Um, why??? All in all, this film DOES have its flaws, but it is still an improvement over its predecessor and it is very fun to watch. Not to mention other ""threequels"" (thought it up myself) like Jaws 3, Amityville 3, Superman III, Spiderman III, etc, are MUCH worse than this awesome, suspenseful, well written film. 8/10 stars. :)",Jurassic Park III
365,lamps,Very poor ending,6,19 June 2004,"I saw this originally at the cinema. I've just seen it again on TV and my first impression is unchanged.A decent B movie adventure yarn with a very poor ending.JPIII must rate as one of the most toe curlingly best/worst at using the cheap technique of story development based entirely on people doing the wrong thing all the time. Come to think of it, the other two JP's were much the same. Having said that, I was reasonably entertained until suddenly, the entire US fleet turned up along with hundreds of marines. End of film! ""Is that it?"" I asked myself again.The special effects were as good as ever. Story writers seem incabable of doing justice to the extraordinary talents of these special effects technicians and rely too much on them to cover their own inadequacies.Given that the film is only 92 minutes long, I can only conclude that it must have run short of either money or ideas. I suspect the latter.I also suspect we won't be seeing those pterodactyls again.",Jurassic Park III

JP lll is going to get a 9 or better from me just because I love the series. Actually, it deserves it. A few minutes into the film and it's non-stop action. If you have a date prepare to have your hand crushed from fear if they scare easily! Bringing Sam back for JP lll had me hooked. He's a stud actor and carried the film. Dern makes a small appearance. Open for a JP lV! But how??? Positives: The Spinosaurus is awesome and powerful. Who else could kick a T-Rex's butt??? The Kirbys all acted well. The animation of the birds was great! New dinosaurs..cool!  Hang-gliding over the island and fog..oh ya! Sam....period! Dern's curly hair looked great on her. Great non-stop action. Raptors were great as usual. Mystery. A bird cage! Negatives: Too short! Way too short! 92 minutes for $15.00!! Actually less on my watch! C'mon!! Expensive date! This could've gone 2+hrs easily. Why rush it? Dern's marriage to a mystery man? Weak, rapid, stupid ending! T-rex pee..c'mon, do something with that at least! Billy surviving..please! He was bird food! A little blurry on the big screen in my opinion. Unless you have a date and want to be close, see the matinee and save a few bucks, just because it's short...still worth the cash no matter how you dice it! FLAMIO",Jurassic Park III
367,Gorgorgorgoroth,Anyone who likes this movie is an idiot,3,11 July 2016,"When Eric was parasailing with Ben, their boat entered a fog and the guys who were on the boat got killed by an unknown species. The movie never shows what exactly killed off those guys on the boat. How could a creature kill a couple of guys on moving boat?When Alan Grant was giving out a presentation to a bunch of people, he said he would never go on an island that contains a bunch of dinosaurs no matter what yet a several minutes later, Alan agreed to go on Isla Sorna for money. Way to go on contradicting yourself.When Alan was on a plane, he had a dream where no one was on the plane except for him and a Raptor that said his name which was pretty awkward and pointless since it brought almost no suspense at all.After people landed on the island, they decided to go back to the plane because they heard the Spinosaurus roaring. As soon as the plane was in the air, the Spinosaurus showed up and it hit the plane. The plane lost control and crashed in trees. Great mechanics and nice piloting.The Spinosaurus attacked again and knew exactly where the plane was in the trees. It decided to rip the plane in pieces and when the plane fell to the ground, everyone ran out of the plane and it took the Spinosaurus a few seconds to realize everyone just escaped on foot. That scene really showed the Spinosaurus' intelligence.Alan then found out he was paid to be on the island to help the Kirby couple to find their missing who had been missing for 8 weeks. They found a parachute and a camera. Amanda said the camera's batteries died, so the bald guy decided to use batteries from a fvcking flashlight for the camera. WTF?! As they were watching videos on the camera, the camera showed the Kirby family on a beach and Amanda said that was taken in the morning when Eric left. Umm wait, earlier Amanda said she and Paul had a divorce a year ago, so why was Paul in the video with Amanda 8 weeks ago on a beach? That doesn't sound like what a divorced couple would do.Ben was found on the parachute completely in skeletons. So let me get this straight, a person's corpse will be nothing but bones in just 8 weeks or less? WHAT?! The people found this facility where dinosaurs were being created and Amanda saw a Raptor's head that was just awkwardly standing there still and then it proceeded to attack them. Why didn't the Raptor attack those people earlier? Why was that Raptor standing there awkwardly still?Alan and Eric heard a phone ring from MILES away and they started running. Paul and Amanda heard Eric yelling from MILES away. They reunited at a fence and when they turned around, the Spinosaurus was awkwardly standing there staring at them. Why was it just staring at them?! Why didn't the Spinosaurus just attack the people as soon as it saw them? And how the actual FVCK could those people hear the phone ringing when it was inside the Spinosaurus' stomach, especially when they were miles away from it? Why the fvck was the phone still working when it was inside the Spinosaurus' stomach?! The people ran away from the Spinosaurus and hid inside this building. So let me get this straight, a Spinosaurus can break through a steel fence in a second, but it can't break through a steel door? Eric saw a Pteranodon walking right towards him on the bridge, caught him and flew away. Everyone else decided to run on the bridge. Seemed like the whole ""one person at a time"" idea was pointless.After the people escaped from the birdcage, one of the doors opened trying to build up more suspense yet we don't get to see Pteranodons attack again in the film so what was the point of that door opening?The people were on a boat and they heard a phone ringing and it turned out the phone was inside the Spinosaurus' feces. Why was that phone still working?! The next day, the people were running toward an ocean and they happened to bump into Raptors and it turned out the Raptors were after them the whole time because Billy took two of their eggs and the Raptors wanted their eggs back. WHAT?! It would make more sense if the Raptors were after them because the Raptors wanted to eat them, but no, the Raptors wanted their eggs back. Once they got their eggs back, the Raptors left. That idea was so retarded. Seriously, who wrote this? And somehow, Amanda was the special snowflake because the Raptor specifically wanted HER to give back the eggs. As Amanda was giving back the eggs, Alan thought it would be fun to try out Billy's Raptor whistle which made no difference to the situation at all so what was the point in that? And as Alan was blowing on the whistle, Paul the retard said ""call for help."" WTF?! How could Alan call for help with a whistle? If Alan tried to call for help by making a Raptor's sound, it would only attract more Raptors.At the end of the film, it turned out Billy was alive the whole time. HOW?! He was getting his ass kicked by the Pteranodons a bunch of times while his body was in moving water yet you're telling me the military found him and Billy was OK.",Jurassic Park III

You've seen it all before, many many times, so every shot and every scene is predictable to absurdity. Maybe if the makers of this movie were not such control freaks who tried to control your every emotion, it would have some innocence to it, some spirit of adventure.

369,Kuntos_the_Destroyer,The summer of 2001 continues....,4,3 August 2001,"I first saw Jurassic Park at the local cinema when I was 12 years old. Needless to say, I loved it at the time. And even when I saw it again recently it worked for me. Jurassic Park may not be up there with Raiders of the Lost Ark or Aliens, it's still reasonably solid entertainment. I thought The Lost World was a complete dud. One of the reasons I wasn't really that interested in a third instalment of the series. When Spielberg hired Joe Johnston (I hated Jumanji) to fill the director's chair my interest almost much died completely. Almost, because I did decide to go see it.And for the umpteenth time this summer I was disappointed. The first twenty minutes are character exposition (read: cardboard exposition) scenes. A lot has been made of the film's short running time. The strange thing is, it doesn't feel that short. Those first scenes are so badly written (I doubt if there's a single worthwhile line of dialogue throughout, actually) you'll think you've been sitting in the theatre for an entire hour. After that I thought the movie would pick up, but after five good minutes the pace dropped again and it becomes one of those tedious 'wait-for-the-action' type films. Worst of all is what the screenwriters have chosen to fill the action gaps with: dull character interplay, rather unbelievable (and completely unnecessary) revelations about the raptors and even the introduction of the obligatory kid (a device which has been over- and misused after Aliens). On top of that there doesn't seem to be any effort on Johnston's part to keep the tension sustained between attacks.Now, you could just chalk a lot of the un-amazingness up to over-exposure to CG dinosaurs, with the BBC's Walking With Dinosaurs and Disney's Dinosaur (a project which really should have been made silent and by Paul Verhoeven) having been released since The Lost World. But that's not it. The set-pieces here play more like traditional action sequences without requiring the audience to go 'ooh' and 'aah' at the latest in virtual vermin (although there still are a couple of those shots slotted in). So lack of wonder isn't the problem. What is? Try rushed editing, shocks that don't shock and no suspense whatsoever. I can take bad dialogue, a downright stupid storyline and cardboard characters in a summer blockbuster, but I do expect the set-pieces to be either ultracool or nerve-wrecking. Here only two, maybe three scenes approach some form of excitement.And it's with two of these (a crash/ Spinosaurus attack and a dinosaur fight) that the movie, 20 minutes in, seems to be breaking stride. If only Joe Johnston managed to keep it up for the rest of the time. Any other points left to discus? Well, the ending sucks, I hate the way the climactic attack is intercut, you'll see who the victims and survivors are within seconds, the humour mostly misses the mark and at times the CG dinosaurs are below par. Then there's the acting; seldom was a cast this uncharismatic. You can actually read the dollar signs in Sam Neill's and William H. Macy's eyes (otherwise fine actors) and Tea Leoni is so terrible you'll want her to be eaten as soon as possible.In short: An extremely formulaic, very badly written sequel. In fact, the short running time is the only thing that makes it reasonable watchable. Now THAT'S praise!Rating: 4/10",Jurassic Park III
370,Lt Wolf Maker,"A very unintelligent movie. [Grant, first you wait for the check to clear...]",2,9 August 2001,"Steven Spielberg was executive producer.  What's the point?  There were no opening credits.Saving grace - the puppetmaster God himself, Stan Winston.  His talent is unsurpassed and undeniable: incredible dinosaurs from start to finish.  But this is also the man who brought us the imagery of Jurassic Park 1, Jurassic Park 2, The Terminator, Terminator 2, Aliens as well as  Predator (so how can we expect anything-less-than-fascinating creature effects to a point past realism, creeping toward nightmare inducing).  Mr Winston, you are an asset to the industry and I thank you for your contribution to cinema and my imagination.Now back to our regularly scheduled movie review.  Which movie, you ask? The one suffering from massive ""coincidental"" syndrome?  Yeah, that's the one.Mystery Science Yourassic Park 3,000 --- pure crap.  Not provoking.  Not thoughtful.  Dense fun from a rather ignorant writer, but I won't mention his name.  The fable is pathetic and stupid.  A low-level quality story lacking an absorbing resurrection usually desirable in sequels.   JP means fun masochism, not shovelful-ed ingredients of ""look"" ""dinosaur"" ""run"" ""escape"" ""relax"" (repeat cycle).Come on, what am I stupid?  Dinosaurs in embryonic, liquid-filled chambers and kids surviving weeks alone in lonely, violent environments (can you say Newt from Aliens?).  Idiotic conceptions with probability.  [Everything is laid out so smooooothly, and always on schedule.  How boring.]It's not funny.  At least not humor for an intelligent person.  Overall, this movie was not written by an intelligent person and isn't geared to entertain an intelligent person.  It's just dumb at this point.  The Jurassic Park franchise is alive and well due to clever pioneers, but in the wrong hands it's an ugly nothing.  The not-as-glamorous, not-as-interesting, paler, thinner, extracted little brother of the original.The setting is murky, misty, green and stinky.  HORRIBLE sense of location. You just don't know where the characters are or where they're coming from. No internal philosophy with the haunting unpredictability when the dinosaurs emerge from the great unseen of the lush forest.  The  all-Caucasian cast are in this hazardous, venomous environment but don't realize the potential of their horror.  They are out in the open and not panicking because there is no dino-scene scheduled at this time - and they know it.  In a good movie, nobody EVER knows.  It's in the fear of the mystery that we become enveloped; it's then when our imaginations create the uncreatable and we get our delicious terror.  Fear of the unknown, fear of what's out there --- THAT is good cinema.  But not now.  Not here.  Not in JP3.  Nothing new. Nothing fun.  Only a dissolved concept in a dead movie not even a ghost of the first.  Not even worth remembering.  I wish I never saw it.  My idea of what JP3 was going to be before going was more interesting than any of the regurgitated impetuosity that the movie actually was.  It sucked.Jurassic Park 3, you are extinct.  2 stillborn raptors out of 10.",Jurassic Park III
371,Adam-95,"Superior to ""Lost World"" in every way. Great fun.",7,18 July 2001,"Lean, fast and fun seems to be the objective of Jurassic Park III and it succeeds without ever hitting a dull spot.  It wastes no time in getting to the island and once it does it just doesn't let up.

372,MrBook,Fairly entertaining summer movie. A lot better than part 2.,7,23 July 2001,"***Warning: Possible Spoilers*** This movie seems they took some of the actions sequences from the first book that didn't make it into the first movie, and they put it in Jurrassic Park 3. While the plot isn't too good, the movie is pretty entertaining. I heard that the movie was the darkest and most violent in the series, but after seeing it, I hardly agree. I think the first is the most violent (and darkest for what the series is). I expected to just see dinosaurs chasing, fighting eachother, and eating people... but it almost seemed like they didn't have enough of that. Well... there was a lot of chasing, but in terms of eating people or anything else, the movie was a letdown. The hyped up Spinosaurus vs. T-Rex fight was a disappointment, and was about 15 seconds long. I expected the Spinosaurus to be truly frightening... to dwarf the T-Rex in comparison of being scary and mean... and although he did cause some suspense, he didn't gather up nearly enough to compare to the first JP. I don't know... maybe the effect has worn off after 2 movies. Or maybe it was the cell phone thing that killed the element of suprise. There also wasn't enough extras to be eaten. While the Spinosaurus, Raptors, and Pterodactyles were good FX, everything else seemed to need work.I actually liked all the characters with the exception of Tea Leoni, who was extremely annoying. I was at a point where I wanted to see her get chomped. I blame it mostly on the writers.Despite all the negative aspects I've mentioned, the movie is entertaining in being more of a tv pilot than an epic summer action. It was like ""this week on JP: the series, we find out that the raptors can talk to eachother"".
I still give it a 6.5, or 7 out of 10.",Jurassic Park III
373,ruanstb,Quite enjoyable!,6,14 October 2006,"I was definitely excited for some more Jurassic Park so my anticipation for the second sequel was pleasant. It is exactly what I expected  less plot and more dinosaur action! There is nothing great or spectacular about JP3 but it is a credible improvement on 'The Lost World: JP2'. It is jam packed with action, fast paced chases and features some new Dino's having a go at man meat. It remains interesting by presenting humor all the way through, and the writers produced some nail-biting situations that kept me on the edge of my seat. It doesn't take itself seriously and there is also no lack in the technical department- quality special effects, good editing and a short runtime which is fitting. It made me laugh, it made me jump. 'Jurassic Park III' is modest & undemanding entertainment that I found a lot of fun to watch.

More raptors incoming, including a talking one in the beginning as part of Alan's dream ( hence my title for the review), but alot of cool raptor stuff happens like Alan learning how smart they are, also a a really great Pterodactyl scene, which was really cool as well.

But the mission is poorlyplanned and things go wrong almost immediately, stranding theKirbys and their rescue team on the island as well. Thoughunprepared for the dangers ahead of them, they must somehowfind Eric and get off Isla Sorna alive.          If you can believe for a moment that a 12-year-old mightcould survive on a dinosaur infested island for 8 weeks (that's howmuch time lapses between his accident and the rescue mission),the set-up for Jurassic Park III is pretty good. Unfortunately, thestory deteriorates rapidly after that, jumping from one mediocredinosaur scene to another. At a mere 85 minutes in length,director Joe Johnston rushes us through interesting plot devices(a replicated raptor vocal bone, for one), focusing instead on theeasy and obvious (like a satellite phone). And, of course, there'sthe ""family"" story, which manages to resolve itself without any effortwhatsoever.           For the most part, the characters are as flat as the paper theywere written on (the Raptors have more personality!). Fineperformances by William H. Macy (Paul Kirby) and Michael Jeter(Udesky) do bring a little life to the screen, but given the material,it's not enough to help this movie. In fact, every bit of depth theyprovide is destroyed by Sam Neill (reprising his role as Dr. AlanGrant), Téa Leoni (Amanda Kirby) and Alessandro Nivola (Billy),who largely perform as if reading straight off the script.          Jurassic Park III isn't a complete failure, but it's definitelybland and unsatisfying. After a solid first act, the chopped up actionsequences and rather abrupt ending that follow make it feelunbalanced and unfinished. Sure, the dinosaurs are cool to lookat, but that's about all this movie has to offer.",Jurassic Park III
377,sam_nas,One of my all-time favourite movies!,10,26 December 2001,"What an incredible movie!  I bought the dvd and I have already seen it about 5 times, and the special features are also amazing.  One of the times that I saw it was with my family, and all 4 of us agreed that it's better then The Lost World and that it's as good as the first Jurassic Park.  We all loved it.For the people here who are complaining about the movie and who are basically searching for intense deep conversation, extremely complicated storylines, sophistication, to learn something extraordinary about life etc., YOU ARE NOT WATCHING THE RIGHT MOVIE!  This is an action movie!  And to me, it's probably the BEST action movie ever made.  It delivers in every way.The settings are incredible.  The whole movie is filmed in nature and it's such a pleasure to watch it.  Your eyes will be satisfied, the settings are amazing.  As for the dinosaurs, I have never seen anything like it!  They are incredible and I doubt it's possible to make them look more realistic then this.The movie is full of action, just like many people have said, it's a THRILL RIDE.  You never get bored, it's non stop action.  Another good thing is that there's also humor at the right places.  In my opinion, all the actors played their roles perfectly.  The action sequences are incredible and very realistic.  In other words, the dinosaurs react and move just like they would probably have if they were alive, they are  based on real scientific research.Also each action sequence is basically a story on its own.  It's not literally dinosaurs chasing humans the whole time, the action sequences are much more sophisticated and very different from each others.  IMO, this new director has done an incredible job.  I also enjoyed seeing the flying dinosaurs (I forget their name) and of course Spinosaurus, T-Rex, Raptors among many others.This is what a dinosaur movie should be like, they are in THEIR surroundings & territory (meaning the forest) which is incredible to see.  It's probably my favourite Jurassic Park movie and I suggest to everyone to go see it and judge for yourself.  If you don't, then it's your loss.  I recommend it to anyone who loves dinosaurs/nature or action movies in general.  I can't wait for the 4th movie and I plan to buy the 2 other dvds very soon because it's been a while that I haven't seen them!  This movie has turned me into a Jurassic Park fan!

378,forehead1,What a load of,3,24 July 2001,"(May contain Spoilers)I consider myself a rarity - an adult who actually enjoyed both previous Jurassic Park movies.  However, I cannot condone this farce of a film and pray that people will be able to read this before wasting their hard-earned money on such tripe.Let's get the pro's out of the way first: the effects were impressive (even more improvement on the first two films) and the sounds were good.  Sorry, but that's about it.I won't waste time talking about the wafer-thin plot or the sporadic action sequences as I'm sure somebody who hated this film more than me will love to list the many faults in these areas.  I will say this however: if any part of you thought either of the first two were just dino-chasing farces then DO NOT go see this film.  The scriptwriters who worked on this almost non-existent storyline should be shot.  The film was so unoriginal too; most of the scenes and ideas were pulled straight from other successes - look out for Indiana Jones and Alien 3 in particular.I won't even start on the end.  The least you expect from a film like this is an impressive action-sequence to finish it off.  I simply couldn't believe it when the credits started rolling.  ""What?  That's it?!""I'll leave anyone who's had the misfortune to watch this astronomic disappointment with a couple of questions: The camp on the island would have been around 10 years max.  How come then is it decaying and falling to pieces like old balser wood?

This sucks Tyranosaurus balls.Even William H Macy (who was brilliant in Fargo) can't save this, as the writer has him spouting unintelligable dialogue and unfunny, inappropriate jokes.Tea Leoni is awful - her emotions are so contrived you couldn't really care less about her son. Mind you - you wouldn't anyway the story is so ridiculous.Amazingly the dinosaurs look far, far less convincing than they did in the original Jurassic Park. I suspect this is due to an over reliance on CGI, as opposed to the physical effects used in the first film.So, with an awful story, hideous dialogue, painful jokes and suspect dinosaur animation, Jurassic Park 3 is a soul-less cash-in on the original.If you really want to be insulted for 90 minutes, do yourself a favour and invite some friends round to do it for you.

The group finds the parachute and suddenly a dead body drops from the tree and it's still attached to the parachute ¿why is he dead? ¿why the boy isn't? May be a pteranodon o something like it, killed him before he got out of the parachute...¡¡¡please!!!The raptors are worse with all that stupidity of ""they were smarter than primates... They could talk to each other"". OK, If they are so smart how is it that they couldn´t killed that boy? And the last scene, I can't understand why they put that scene: Just imagine: the greatest effects of all time by ILM,the animatronics from Stan W., at least they could`ve had a big action sequence to bring the movie a decent and  ending.But noooooo...They have to put a very boring,non-exciting scene with the raptors trying to get their eggs.How is it possible that an action movie could end like that? I don't know.It sound like i hate the movie but i don`t: -It has its moments: like the pteranodon sequence, the battle of the T-REX AND THE SPINOSAURUS, and the plane crash.Other good things about this movie (and i mean it) are the outstanding special effects by ILM (I COULDN'T POSSIBLY FORGET THE BATTLE BETWEEN T-REX AND SPIN..) and the sound effects...beyond that, it is really boring and nothing special.I hope that they took more seriously JP4, and bring the story a worth seeing ending with a great story and more ACTION¡¡¡ because JP3 doesn't have the action I was expecting.i give it an 8, and i`m being very considerate.",Jurassic Park III

He took the third option and never decided. This movie lacked excitement and consistancy.  The beasts looked great and that was fun, but nothing else worked for me. Action scenes took you to a point that would have been fun, but then they remembered it was also a kids movie so they stopped the scene before it could get hot.SPOILER WARNING!!!!The movie got so bad, that toward the end, I turned to the guy next to me, woke him up and said ""10 bucks says they 'cut a deal' with the dinosaurs"".

384,LessThanPaddy,Is it THAT bad?,5,31 March 2017,"There is no need to draw comparisons with the original, it is the best hands down so I won't even entertain the dimension of comparing JP and JP3. That being said, I think it's worth drawing some comparisons with TLW. Seemingly, fans don't give too much praise to TLW, but seem to be in agreement that it's poles apart from JP3... is it though? After watching the original trilogy recently I can't seem to get why TLW is pardoned and JP3 lauded, the former in my opinion is the weakest of the series.Don't get me wrong, JP3 is far from perfect. My point is that I don't see why it gets negativity where TLW doesn't. Personally I think that JP3 holds up better. Yes, the film is shorter and the CGI is horrible, but I think it has many strengths over TLW. Primarily the cast, I genuinely think JP3 has a much stronger cast/characters, it's great to have Sam Neill back and partnered this time with William H Macy (Admittedly Tea Leoni is irritating in this film)... Goldblum just doesn't work as an protagonist in TLW. The story holds up better too, TLW made little sense to me and ends with a T-Rex being released in San Diego... Whereas, JP3 is essentially a survivalist film, perhaps a bit cliché but not that dull, especially given that the movie re installs our fear for the raptors and introduces the Spinosaurus. JP3, is not THAT bad, and I don't mean to bash TLW unfairly, I don't think it's THAT bad either I just don't see why it's viewed as better than JP3 when it has a much more duller plot with uninteresting characters. Admittedly, I enjoyed JP3 much more as a kid, now that I'm older I can see it's flaws, I just don't buy into the massive hate it gets. Surely any JP movie featuring Sam Neill is worth consideration?",Jurassic Park III
385,Gordon-38,"The Dictionary Definition of ""Unnecessary Sequel""",5,2 August 2001,"I suppose ""Jurassic Park III"" is useful for one thing: it demonstrates that Steven Spielberg phoning it in is still better than Joe Johnston giving it his all.  Even the mediocre-at-best ""The Lost World"" is better than this thing.Sure, the dinosaurs look great - one might go so far as to say that they look better than ever.  And some of the action set pieces are pretty fun, though none of them come even close to the first T-Rex attack or the climactic Raptor chase in the original ""Jurassic Park.""But the film cannot overcome its own flaws.  I'll be the first to tell you that the Spinosaurus is a wicked-cool dinosaur.  But there's not even the slightest attempt to explain why this beast, apparently bigger and badder than T-Rex, pops up in the third installment without having appeared or even so much as having been mentioned in either of the first two.That sort of sums up the fatal flaw of the entire film: it's pointless. Nothing is ever adequately explained.  None of the characters, even the venerable Dr. Grant, is given anything interesting to say or do.A note for the writers and director Johnston: Pay attention, as you seem to have missed some important lessons in drama class.  A standard story structure for a film such as this would be: Rising action, climax, falling action, roll end credits.  The path you've chosen instead: rising action, roll end credits.  Additionally (MINOR MAYBE SPOILER UPCOMING), well...let's just say that the deus ex machina plot resolution is weak at best.  I'd really like to learn more about the digestive system of a spinosaurus, though, since apparently a sattelite phone can pass through it unharmed. (END SPOILER, THANKS)So...my reccomendation?  Dust off your VHS or DVD of the original ""Jurassic Park"" to get a dinosaur fix.  If you're headed to the the theater, go for ""Planet of the Apes"" instead.",Jurassic Park III
386,PJ-52,A Lack of Directing Style,5,31 August 2001,"The overall feel of the third Jurassic Park movie is relatively low-grade, without Spielberg directing. Spielberg has the ability to create ""blockbuster"" action sequences like in ""Jurassic Park 1 & 2"" or ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" or ""Saving Private Ryan"". This movie lacked that style. Most of all this movie lacked coherency because of shoddy post-production editing (probably because they went over-budget). I could give numerous examples of this throughout the entire film's running time.The story lacked suspense, and became quite improbable at times. The characters apart from Dr. Grant were very uninteresting.My rating: Spinosaurus 10/10 the rest eaten by editing 0/10.",Jurassic Park III
387,gstiger,Jurassic Park 3 was a pleasant surprise.,5,21 July 2001,"After the large disappointment that was The Lost World: Jurassic Park, I wasn't expecting too much from this film; I was, however, pleasantly surprised. While this film does not invoke the sense of awe and sheer power of the first film, it's still one heck of a thrill ride.Director Joe Johnston does a fine job at filling Steven Spielberg's rather large shoes. His style of direction is quite reminiscent of the previous two films. The cast is fairly good, especially for a summer blockbuster. Sam Neill reprises his role from the first film and does a good job at doing so. William H. Macy is a welcome addition to the cast. Téa Leoni does come off as being somewhat annoying, though.The story is, by no means, groundbreaking. The screenwriters borrow many elements from the first two films but add some of their own ideas. A new cast and new dinosaurs also help in making the film appear to be more original and fresh.While Don Davis's musical score isn't as majestic and powerful as John Williams's score for the previous films, it does serve its purpose of heightening the action.The special effects are very good but not quite up to par with those of the first film. The CGI dinosaurs have a `computer tint' to them. The animatronic dinosaurs are quite effective, however.In fact, I only have two real complaints with this film. Where the first film was perhaps too slow in its pacing, this one feels very rushed; some scenes fly by and don't give you an opportunity to catch your breath. With a running time of only 90 minutes, one would think the film could have been lengthened to draw the story out. The finale is also a little too `audience friendly.' I doubt we'll see many summer blockbusters, this year, that will be better than this.",Jurassic Park III
388,meet_the_feebles,Jurassic Park (3),4,25 July 2001,"It seems to me that the masters of this film only needed the name. This movie was a waste of time and life. When I go to see something called part 3, I expect it to live within the same realms of part 1 and part 2 (no matter how bad part 2 maybe). Jurassic Park 3 is a nasty movie that treats it's dinosaurs like Jason, Michael Meyers, or Freddy Kruger, not like animals. These dinosaurs wouldn't just want to kill people just to kill them. The raptors also talk. They talk. What? The movie was a subtitle away from making me vomit. This was worse than 1997's Godzilla (the one the Americans made), and I hated hated hated hated that Godzilla movie.I thought Jurassic Park 3 was 2 hours like the other two, it felt like it, but when I left I found out it was 93 minutes. How did a movie turn 93 minutes into 120 minutes. Also, this movie has the world's loudest cell phone, and world's dumbest cameo. I hated Jurassic Park 3, no matter how big the dinos were (of course we only got close-ups of the Dinosaurs so we rarely got to see their height next to a human). Please, please do all of humanity a favor and don't let this movie gross any huge amount of money, because they're only going to make a Part 4, and it's going to have something to do with Pterodactyls lose in the city. *1/2 (2)",Jurassic Park III
389,cdipatri,"Definitely Edges Out ""The Lost World""",8,24 July 2001,"I went to see the latest installment twice.  It is much, much more enjoyable and much, much better than ""The Lost World"".  I would have liked to see it a little longer, possibly developing Billy and the 2 mercenaries some more, but overall, it was good enough to make me spend the admission cost twice. I definitely wanted more of Laura Dern, but such is life.The Spinosaurus was done in an excellent mix of fearsomeness, intelligence and comedy. The part when they hear the sat phone ringing and turn to see the Spinosaurus (who ate the person who had it last) just standing there looking at them got me hysterical.  Also, many of you along with myself, have seen Pteradactlys in so many movies about prehistoric worlds, but it was so cool being this up close and personal to them.  The digital effects geniuses did a great job with them.As far as I'm concerned, the acting, the story and all the effects make for an enjoyable experience that should happen in the theater at least once. Now I'll have to sit and wait for the DVD.  Oh, by the way, one of the highlights of seeing this film, and hopefully one that you'll experience when you see it, is seeing the teaser for ""Spiderman"" due out next May.

Few films in the history of cinema have relied more on idiotic coincidence than JP3 does, the surest sign of braindead, lazy scripting.  Two-dimensional characters, walkthrough performances, and an entire plot that can be described in 10 words.  What a mess, by any standard of filmmaking.  Beautiful dinosaurs though and that's why people will see this film, why I saw it.

393,pmoney13,Enjoyable B-movie,7,23 July 2001,"I  walked out of the theater to JP3 last week and got exactly what I wanted: entertainment. There are many reviews out there criticizing this film for its lack of plot and character development, but that's nitpicking. The simple fact is that Jurassic Park 3 is a fun film. It's no work of art, just a good, thrilling 90-minute ride that delivers all the goods.The second sequel has Dr. Grant going along with a divorced couple to find their son, who has disappeared somewhere in Isla Sorna, an island populated by dinosaurs. They crash land their plane and the inevitable dinosaur carnage ensues, with all of the minor supporting characters getting eaten very quickly. The surviving group soon has to battle vicious raptors (who can now communicate with each other, in order to set up elaborate traps for the human victims) and battle with the gigantic Spinosaur, who is even more deadly than the T-Rex. As you could probably tell from the summary, the film doesn't waste too much time with plot. It goes full bore into the action and doesn't let up. The most exciting sequence in the film is when the group stumbles into a giant birdcage for pteranodons. This part of the film is very intense, and the flying dinosaurs are truly menacing. Another highlight of the film was the Spinosaur, a huge and frightening dino that provides for some tense scenes. Sam Neill returning as Alan Grant helped, and they don't turn his character into a soppy mess as they did with Ian Malcolm in The Lost World. One other thing I appreciated was that the kid didn't turn out to be some obnoxious plot device, like the girl in Lost World. You actually like the kid.Let us now compare two movies: JP3 and Tomb Raider. Both films have the same apparent distaste for plotting and story, and both films have several plot holes and confusing moments. The only difference is that Tomb Raider was boring as all hell, and Jurassic Park 3 was exciting. This is the way to make a summer movie. I could harp on and on about the inconsistencies in the script or the flaws in the plot, but I don't need to because the action scenes pay off, and I was entertained. And that's all that matters.",Jurassic Park III

After sitting a few hours after the movie, I could think of things that were a bit ridiculous, but to me it did not detract from the movie.Of the 3 films, this movie seemed to be more action/scare oriented, and I like horror/scary movies so I guess it appealed to me.All 3 films had ridiculous parts, so I'm not sure how this one ranks.  Lets say the ending could have been a little longer and a bit different, and I think I would have rated the movie a little higher.  I give it a 6 out of 10.  The new dinosaur Spinosaurus is very scary.  It's interesting how each new movie introduces a dinosaur I've never heard of before.  Of course wondering on the accuracy I checked it out.  I always thought T-Rex was the largest predator.  It seems I have found that Spinosaurus was indeed larger. However, in the site I looked up, it stated Spinosaurus was indeed LONGER, but not the biggest as T-Rex was most likely Bigger as Spinosaurus was more lightly built.In either case, I thought the scene with the two dinosaurs was great.I would recommend it as a matinee, or on video as a rental.",Jurassic Park III

So I am not getting into it.Really, when I went to see Jarassic Park 3, all I wanted to see was a film that was better than JP 2. That is what I got. In the end though, it just feels empty. You don't care about any of the characters except for Dr. Green, because they are so stupid. Not sure what else to say... many of the summer movies are lacking like this one.

405,hydrocilator,Pleasantly surprised,6,19 July 2001,"Overall I was pleasantly surprised with this movie.  It accomplishes what it sets out to do; It puts the viewer on the dinosaur infested island for a thrilling roller coaster ride of adventure.If you go into this movie with the mentality of a critic, you will find flaws. Some of the scenes were like watching the old TV show 'fantasy island'.  For example, the opening scene is has the two actors in parasailing near Isla Sorna.  Besides the idea being a little rediculous, the background in the close-ups was obviously fake.  It really felt like I was watching a TV show.Some of the acting was a little awkward but I'm not sure if that was the actor's fault or the writer's.  For example, most of the scenes between the mother and father of the boy, Eric.When you boil down the story, it's really just an excuse to put us on the island again.  Once you're on the island, we follow the same pattern as the first Jurassic Park: HOW DO I GET OFF?!?!I recommend just looking past all of these things and enjoy the thrilling scenes with the dinosaurs.  Nearly all scenes with Dr. Grant (Sam Neill) are good.  It is also a nice surprise to see Dr. Sattler (Laura Dern) although I wish she would have had a more significant role in the film.There some memorable moments in the movie like when we first meet the sail-back 'super' predator and when he/she fights the T-Rex.
This movie is not as good as the first JP but it is waaaay better than the second one.My rating:    6.6I thought of a fun fantasy variant of this movie... A mix between Aliens and Jurassic Park.  Arnold Schwarzenegger leads an elite force of seals to Isla Sorna to extract a team of scientists who have become stranded there. OOoooooh yah!

406,dltdvd,Good popcorn movie that pretends to be nothing more.,7,26 February 2002,"I enjoy popcorn movies for the most part, I just don't understand why the director has to go out and make it seem more than it really is. Fortunately, for Jurassic Park III, director Joe Johnston could make a popcorn movie and have it be exactly that. Johnston has always been good with that. There is almost no film by Johnston that wasn't entertaining. However, I disagree that JP3 was actually darker and more involved than the previous two movies, like previews and articles depicted. I wasn't expecting Jurassic Park III to surpass the wonder of the first one, and I wasn't expecting it to be as disappointing (the Lost World was still pretty good) as the second one.As a fan of all of the Jurassic Park movies, I could say that this had the nicest and yet quickest pacing. It also had the best special effects of the three. One thing I've noticed is that the first two took place mostly in the dark, especially when there are special effects. Now, you actually get to see the texture of the dinosaurs. The dinosaurs in JP3 tend to have more color, thanks to Industrial Light & Magic and visual effects supervisor Jim Mitchell.One thing that the third installment lacks are likable characters, with the exception of Sam Neill as Alan Grant. New characters aren't as humorous, but this could be because of the abscence of director Steven Spielberg. And even Joe Johnston has the potential to put humor in his characters to make them a little bit more likable.Overall, JP3 was a good addition to the Jurassic Park franchise. I can guarantee that there will be more movies. Hopefully Steven Spielberg will return as producer, because if he doesn't, then Jurassic Park will end up like Batman when Tim Burton left.",Jurassic Park III

408,nathanhmcdonald,Doesn't quite live up to the legend that is Jurassic Park.,6,10 October 2011,"Once again Dr. Alan Grant (Sam Neill) finds himself on an remote island running for his life from rabid dinosaurs.First off let talk about what irks me about this movie...There is a lot of plot holes...I'm just going to leave that one at that. This whole, lets bring a new dinosaur in and replace the old ''king of the jungle'' dinosaur with it idea didn't work to well. The new dinosaur is the Spinosaures which early in the movie gets into an altercation with the old Jurassic Park sponsor ''T-Rex'' and after a brief fight the Spinosaures snaps the neck of the T-Rex and is the new king of the jungle. But even that can be forgiven had it not been for heartwarming loving family scenes in the movie. They just come off cheesy.Example...Eric meets up with his parents ''whom tricked Dr. Grant and his assistant into bringing them to the island''. Anyway when Eric first meets up with his parents they play this overly gushy orchestrated music, the whole scene just comes off as cheesy and embarrassing. And again we are confronted with more family oriented cheese when later that night Eric and his mother and father are sitting in a tree, His father ''Paul Kirby - William H. Macy'' precedes to tell us a story about a fishing trip go awry in which the tow truck driver who had to tow Paul's car and boat out of the boat launch gets angry when his tow truck is pulled in as well and ''threatens to punch his lights out''...It wasn't funny and it totally takes away from what Jurassic Park is supposed to be IMO.Another annoyance of mine is the character Billy...Billy serves as Dr. Grant's trainee basically. A young ambitious paleontologist. Billy does something really stupid halfway through the movie ''Steals Raptor Eggs'' which in turn leads the ever lethal Raptors to pursue them across the island. Dr. Grant doesn't learn of this until later. After a brief confrontation with the Teredactycals in the aviary scene Billy uses a ripped parachute to save Eric from certain death, After which the Teredactycals turn their hostility to Billy, he is last seen being pecked to death as he floats down the river. Billy SHOULD have died in this scene, if anything for dramatic effect. But instead he shows up alive and well at the end of the movie...Well battered from his encounter...But alive none the less.What else...Let's see...I love Sam Neill, the name is a great actor and I really loved him as Dr. Grant in JP1. But in JP3 he was given some...Goofy dialog. Example...During one scene they are being attacked by Raptors...Grant and his gang get the upper hand on one of the Raptors and get it stuck behind a huge iron door that encloses a cage...The Raptor shrills and makes these weird chirping noises...Grant responds to this with...''My god! He's calling for help!''...How do you know that? I mean I know that paleontologist generally know more about dinosaur behavior than anyone else...But come on...And another scene, when one of the Raptors circles their group in the jungle, Grant advises that everyone get down because he's challenging us.Jurassic Park III provides some entertainment...But it just doesn't live up to what it could have been.6/10 stars.",Jurassic Park III

410,stakes,time to put an end to the franchise,4,5 May 2002,"The Jurassic Park series, which started off with an original, imaginative, fun romp of a movie, has bottomed out rather quickly with this third installment to the series.The dinosaurs are impressive as always, but the day in age in which fantastic CGI could make a movie on it's own are gone.  Such flicks are a dime a dozen now, and to stand out from the pack, movies have to rely on more classic aspects of film-making.  Like the story, for example.And there in lies the problem with Jurassic Park 3.  Filled with plot holes, this movie simply re-hashes the first two films: humans are stupid enough to get trapped on island with dinosaurs, humans make the dinosaurs mad, humans get chased around by dinosaurs.  It's pretty sad that, even though it took 4 years to make the follow-up to Jurrasic Park: The Lost World, they couldn't come up with an original idea.  It's also a very telling fact that this movie is only 90 minutes long.  Where almost all movies of this blockbuster, action-packed nature usually check in at 2+ hours, the people behind JP3 obviously could not come up with enough original thoughts to stretch this movie out.  It's probably just as well, anyways.",Jurassic Park III
411,strangelexicon,A few good moments and a nice setting,6,4 August 2006,"One really can't understand what the writers and directors were thinking when they planned JP-3? Were they really aiming for a semi-serious or I dare say, comedy, with the talking Raptors and the CGI Spinosaur and all? One should not go expecting anything as massive on the lines of Jurassic Park or the Lost world and the third part really does not compare to either of them. The effort itself has been one on a much smaller scale. The movie is completely devoid of story. As you expect, Sam Neil and a few others crash on the island and they have to escape. So they try and they do. Nothing unusual happens and there's no twist in the story. The ending is quite pathetic.

While the first one will remain a classic, The lost world, in my opinion, could have been much better.  But, the series picks it self up and shows that there can still be great dinosaur flicks made. Director Joe Johnston makes a great effort, and comes away with greatness.  Almost everything that the last two were missing is in this movie.  Dino Fighting, perandons, and lots of raptors. Bringing back Grant was great too.  An already established charecter means no jacking around with the human charecter development and getting right to the Dinos.  Also, moving away from the t-rex as the main big dino and getting the Spinosaur in there was a great choice too.  The Spinosaur is one freakin bad ass.  Although the film is awkwardly paced in some parts, as theres action, action, action, then stops to talk about something for ten minutes kinda throws you off in this movie.  My only main complaint besides the awkward pacing is the time and ending. While i'm not going to tell you the ending, it just seems to come in too abrupt. And the run time, just an hour and a half, it's just too short for a movie of this kind.  It needs to be longer, more dino action.

413,raop74,Jurassic bites!,2,2 September 2001,"Abysmally awful sequel to the original Jurassic Park.  Both Michael Crighton and Stephen Spielberg must be furious at the deterioration of the series, based on the poor quality of this sequel...just go back and watch the brilliance of the first JP. Even JP II was better than this, and that's not saying much. If not for Sam Neill's involvement this time around, I'd have dismissed this one entirely.  He's the only character I had any sympathy and admiration for, every other major character in the movie added nothing to the film.  I especially kept praying that Tea Leoni's character would get eaten messily by the Spinosaurus throughout the film.  Her constant screaming and whining was just annoying. Whatever happened to the smart and CAPABLE female character? Tea's character could take a lesson from Julianne Moore's character in JP II, now there was a tough lady.  William Macy's character was too one dimensional and I couldn't understand why he still loved Tea's character.  She's a shrew! The son was pretty self reliant, but a little too smart alecky.  It was nice to see Laura Dern turn up in this movie, but her role is miniscule and is an utter waste of her talent.
It is obvious right from the beginning of the movie that the script was being worked out as it was being filming, which may be okay for other movies, but is inexucusable for this one. There are so many plot holes and inconsistencies, it's pitiful.  I found the climax to be a bit hard to swallow, and a tremendous let down (like most of the film itself). Too ""deux ex machina"" for me. *WARNING: SPOILERS AHEAD!!*
My real problem with the end of the movie is that it contradicts everything the previous JP films have set up. There's simply no way that the raptors would let the group go just because Sam emits a cry for help on that dinosaur artifact. Tea's character stole the raptors' eggs (why?), the raptors know this, and the raptors have not shown to be merciful in either of the previous films. Based upon their previous behavioral patterns, the raptors would have attacked the humans and at least killed and eaten a few of them (let them start with Tea's character).The raptors' behavior in the climax makes them look stupid, which forever tarnishes their reputation as fearsome and intelligent creatures.  You could actually say that for most of the dinosaurs in the movie, from T-Rex to Spinosarus to the Pterodactyls.  Apparently the Pterodactyls are just like modern birds, since the ones in this movie fly right beside the rescue helicopters at the end, presumably towards the mainlands (why don't they attack the humans in the helicopters?).And how did Laura Dern's character know where the hell the group was to be able to alert what appears to be the entire US Armed Forces to rescue them? Sam's character doesn't mention anything to her about locations in his desperate, too brief, and half inaudible distress call, there are tons of islands in the area, and the rescue parties get there faster than Speedy Gonzales. Finally, why couldn't the stupid parents do the same thing in the beginning after their son's disappearance and avoid this catastrophe of a movie from ever happening?!!?",Jurassic Park III
414,PhilipJames1980,"As a fan of the series, I wasn't disappointed.",7,15 July 2003,"Jurassic Park 3 (JP3) is part of a welcome trend among recent popcorn movies that they are not one minute longer than they absolutely have to be.  In 2002, neither The Scorpion King nor Men in Black II ran longer than 90 minutes, so the tendency is becoming particularly prevalent among sequels.The compact running time of JP3 contributes to its strength, because as the third movie in a series about people struggling to survive close encounters with man-eating dinosaurs, it doesn't have anything new to say, and the filmmakers were honest enough to avoid pretending that they had more than 90 minutes' worth of ideas for it.In such a short movie, there's obviously not much time for character development, but even so I like the early scenes that show how Neill's Grant character has changed since the first JP movie: the scene in which he tells Dern (as Sattler) ""I'm the last of my breed"" is strangely touching, and one of the movie's biggest laughs comes when he prepares to answer questions after his lecture and causes most of the raised hands to disappear by saying ""Does anyone have a question that is NOT related to Jurassic Park?""I'm especially glad that Neill was able to reprise his Grant character from JP because his subsequent career has been disappointing, ranging from mediocre movies (In the Mouth of Madness) to unforgettably awful ones (Event Horizon).  He's in fine form in JP3, giving a performance perfectly suited to the material: I love his deranged yet tongue-in-cheek smile when he says ""Either way, we probably won't get off this island alive,"" as well as the priceless look of fear on his face when he realizes at one point that he's surrounded by velociraptor eggs.William H. Macy and the late Michael Jeter are the other two cast members whose performances are so entertaining that they make the movie worth seeing despite its indefensibly ridiculous story.  Macy's character is reminiscent of his career-making role in Fargo, and there's even a hilarious scene in JP3 in which the other characters realize that he's been lying to them, and when he grasps the situation he awkwardly tries to talk his way out of it in the same manner that his Fargo character might have done.Jeter's character does little besides wisecrack, but he does it flawlessly: he was a solid supporting actor and we will miss him.As I mentioned, the story is noticeably weak, but even so I don't fully understand all the negative comments for JP3 because when I first saw it in the theater the flaws in the script hardly mattered.  The dinosaur sequences really deliver the expected thrills: when I first saw the spinosaurus attack on the airplane, I was a little amazed by how intense, well-directed and superbly edited it is.  In fact, I'm impressed by it no matter how many times I see it.Obviously, people have a right to dislike this movie, but some comments dislike it for reasons that I simply don't understand.  Some have complained about the acting, which I don't understand because as I said Neill, Macy and Jeter are all solid and appear to have had a good time making this movie.Joe Johnston was the ideal candidate to direct this movie in lieu of Spielberg because he tends toward movies which consist largely of characters running from special effects, such as Honey, I Shrunk the Kids and Jumanji. I believe he did as good a job directing this movie as any other director could have done (even Spielberg himself), so I don't agree with people who say that the movie is badly directed.This movie really pleases the kid inside me, because in many respects it's a deliberate throwback to the B-level dinosaur movies of the pre-JP era: indeed, JP3 is closer in spirit to the original King Kong and virtually every B-movie dinosaur-adventure made before the era of blockbusters and CG effects, than it is to Jurassic Park.  None of the earlier movies necessarily had the same plot (desperate parents trying to rescue their kid from a dinosaur-infested island), but any of them COULD have had the exact same plot as JP3, and many of them were similar anyway.So JP3 is a worthy sequel because it brings the series full-circle in a very interesting way: in the first JP, Spielberg was consciously trying to make a new kind of dinosaur movie that depicted dinosaurs as animals rather than monsters, and depicted a plausible scenario whereby they could exist in the modern age.  After the tongue-in-cheek transition of JP2, JP3 is a complete regression to the dinosaur movies of the 1950s, with a ridiculous scenario and the dinosaurs serving merely as larger-than-life movie monsters.
This doesn't mean that JP3 is great cinema, exactly, but when a movie is as fun as this one the regression should be cause for appreciation rather than contempt.Several people have complained about the contrived ending, but I like it for a couple of reasons.  First, it's similar to the actual ending of Crichton's JP novel (more so than the first JP movie), especially because it provides the setup for yet another sequel!Second, JP3 doesn't occur in what I call the Real World: it's a fantasy-adventure.  Even if movies are still bound by certain rules, I'm occasionally amused by one that cheerfully tosses credibility aside at the end.  Because of plot devices like the one in JP3, the phrase deus ex machina (hopefully everyone knows what that is) still has relevance.So JP3 isn't exceptional, but it works as an old-fashioned B-movie adventure and a guilty pleasure, so the flaws in the script hardly matter.  In fact, I'll go see a fourth JP movie on the big screen if it's ever made, even if the same director and writers who made JP3 are credited for it.  What can I say?  I'm a fan.Rating: 7 (It's lots of fun, worth at least one viewing.)",Jurassic Park III

Although it doesn't have much of a story, it has some ok acting,an ok score, and very good visual effects. In the third instalment to the Jurasic Park trilogy Docter Allen Grant (Sam Neil) is tricked into going to the island that was visited in The Lost World Jurassic Park, by a couple looking for their son who was lost on it.  My favorite sequence is the fight between the spinosauress and the t-rex.  This is the second best JP film and the most intense.  I really didn't think it was a total loss.  Worth renting (if for nothing else than the visual effects). I give Jurassic Park 3 6/10",Jurassic Park III

I thought this sequel might be good because JP2 was good but I was wrong! I have picked some notes while watching this movie. Usually Jurassic Park films are 2 hours long, this one is some 40 minutes less! and does not quite contain the same fun and horror it did on previous jp's. DR. Grant returns which is a suprise. It didn't have it's entertaining parts though i must admit. JP3 had amazing special effects, most probably the best out of the three. I have heard that Jurassic Park 4 will be released in 2004.

There was still some in it, but there was way more action than in the first, too. I wouldn't go to see a forth installment, because I think in this one they they already copied themselves and except for new dinosaurs there isn't much they haven't done yet!!

419,kida_fish,"SHORT, SWEET, AND ACTION-PACKED",7,21 July 2003,"JURASSIC PARK  1, was larger than life; larger than anything else that had came out of Hollywood, larger than anything that Spielberg had done before. The concept was fresh, the dinosaurs were scary, the backdrop was unimaginably awesome, and the direction, impeccable. Justifiably, it turned out to be one of the best movies ever, with a huge cult following. It was only natural that it had to be followed up by a sequel, which turned out to be a great disappointment, alas! With the high expectations raised by the first part, in an attempt to live upto the high expectations, in THE LOST WORLD, Spielberg, it seems, tried a bit too hard, making a mess of the movie altogether, making it much too long, much too boring.However, JURASSIC PARK  3, is surprisingly much better than THE LOST WORLD, especially, since, it isn't directed by Spielberg.  OK, so it has the same dinosaurs, and has them chasing around and killing the humans, who repeatedly happen to drop themselves by amongst the dinosaurs, for some strange reason or the other. Well, if THE LOST WORLD was solely about dinosaurs chasing around humans, with a very sorry ending giving out the message `don't mess with nature', this one however, has dinosaurs chasing around humans, but with the feel of a fast-paced action movie! In JURASSIC PARK  3, the director doesn't try to complicate things by trying to bring the dinosaurs to the city and try to make a GODZILLA and a JURASSIC PARK at the same time, but concentrates wholly on the action taking place within the island itself. The movie is incredibly short, and is action-packed, with dinosaurs popping out from every corner of the screen, without a moment of respite; and before you know, the movie ends.Unlike THE LOST WORLD, the straightforwardness of JURASSIC PARK  3 is what makes it a highly viewable movie. There are however, certain things, which this movie could have carried on from THE LOST WORLD, like JEFF GOLDBLUM, and his sarcasms, reeking with pessimism.  The movie is packed with action from the first scene to the last, without trying too hard to be intelligent. Since it doesn't try to achieve much, but only try to entertain, it is short, and makes the viewer want for more.Rating: 7/10",Jurassic Park III
420,radiopal,BETTER THAN LOST WORLD... MUCH BETTER!!!,7,21 December 2003,"When I first saw Jurassic Park, I was disappointed because I just finished reading the book the morning that it opened.  But after the years, I realized that the movie was good... why?  Well, if anyone reads my posts, you'll know that I believe that if a movie is going to be based on a book... it should at least follow the book.   And for the most part it did.  Though I did miss not seeing the Ptarydactals... but hey, that's me.Then a couple of years... I saw Jurassic Park: THE LOST WORLD... I specifically waited to read the book until after seeing the movie.  Guess what?  I thought that the LOST WORLD was okay until... SPOILER!!! SPOILER!!! SPOILER!!! A T-Rex ends up in San Diego.  At that point, I lost it.  I can't watch it.  The departure from the novel started relatively early in the script... and with each passing page, the divergence grew.  I have the movie in my collection... and why?  Don't know.  Anybody interested in a seldom viewed copy of LOST WORLD?  Years later, I finally decided to READ Crighton's fantastic novel and asked myself... why didn't they make this (the book) into a movie.  It would have been cheaper and more entertaining. Crighton was probably spinning in his chair about how rotten LOST WORLD turned out to be.  Now, I first saw the trailers of JURASSIC PARK 3 and thought, hmmm, should I even give the movie a chance?  But it did have ""Tea Leoni"" and ""William Macy"", plus the return of ""Sam Niell"" as Doctor Grant.  I was totally entertained and walked out of the theater thinking how much better this JURASSIC PARK was over the second movie.  Yeah, it does pale in comparrison with the original movie, but it kept the fun of the original as well, and also I think that Michael Crighton probably enjoyed this movie as well.Only watch JURASSIC PARK and JURASSIC PARK 3.",Jurassic Park III
421,VG2000,"Dinos look amazing, but too much of a been there done that feeling.",7,22 July 2001,"I admit that the dinosaurs looked cool. But does the dino franchise have to do the same thing over and over. Bunch of people came to rescue someone, instead they get stranded on the island. But i gladly say this was better than the second one. The Spinosaurus vs T-Rex fight is alone to pay for the movie. Lots of thrills, but the raptors looks horrible, make them look a bit realistic, where are these feathers coming from?. But this is better than some of the other summer offerings. There is no character development, but who cares, it's supposed to be a popcorn movie, if you decide to make a 4th one, make it something new, dinos try and invade Earth or something, don't create another island. The acting department is saved by Sam Neil and William H. Macy, although i think they both were wasted in this movie and Tea Leoni is horribly annoying, you find yourself rooting for the dinos to eat her. But if you just want to go see an action packed movie, filled with amazing dinosaurs check this one out. I give this movie 7/10.",Jurassic Park III

423,jhendricks97,Like going on vacation to the same place 3 times,6,23 July 2001,"`Jurassic Park 3' is pretty much what you would expect from what the rapidly expanding franchise, more of the same.  The movie has more Dinosaurs, and more characters running for their lives.  But no matter how fast the producer's have them run, they can't escape the fact that `Jurassic Park 3' has nothing new to offer us.  The storyline is just as pre-historic as the dinosaurs are.Now this isn't to say that the film has absolutely nothing to offer.  It is a `Jurassic Park' movie after all.  It is still a thrill to see Dinosaurs come alive on the big screen.  More importantly, director Joe Johnson wisely keeps the action coming at a frantic pace.  And even if we're not sitting on the edge's of our seats -- we're still entertained.  Just not as much as the first time around.  3 stars out of 5.",Jurassic Park III
424,matpinckney,Quite good...,7,29 December 2002,"In a lot of cases like the Jurassic Park series, the films deteriorate as the franchise continues. However, the case with the Jurassic Park series is slightly different. The best film came first, followed by the worst (Lost World), and then the quite good.Although not as good as the original film, Jurassic Park III was better than I expected. Following the disaster that was Lost World, I anticipated this film as something to tide me by for a few hours, featuring dinosaurs, and people getting eaten by them while screaming loudly. And of course, these two things were featured. But there actually was quite a good plot, and acting. I was pleased to see Sam Neil return to the series (a factor which instantly made the film more pleasing). The cinematography created a dark atmosphere, and the story moved along at a fair pace.Overall, an good addition to the series.7/10",Jurassic Park III
425,firedude440,If you can survive the boredom you can survive anything,4,26 July 2001,"All right, lets get one thing straight. Joe Johnston wrecked a perfectly good series. It was not thrilling, exciting, or entertaining. They should have waited for Speilberg to get the time to direct it because he would have done an outstanding job. Although he did executive produce it, but he couldn't get the time off from directing Artificial Intellagence, and executive produce Evolution and Shrek. You can't blame him though for trying. But you sure can blame Johnston for everything that happened wrong. Which was all ninety minutes of the film. I heard somewhere that William H. Macy didn't even like his role and he just did it for the money. Well good thing Jeff Goldblum didn't bother with this mess. (Well just think of all the messes he has gone through his life. This wouldn't be any surprise if he had done it.) And another thing is that the graphics are not very good in this one. And there is two new dinosaurs in this one. One of them is bigger than the tyranasaures and you don't get to find out his name. Plus all he is is a tyranasaures with a fin on the back. And you only see him in one scene which stinks and you don't even see the tyranasaures in the film. Plus the scene with tyranasaurus with a fim only lasts for about a minute and that is all for him. The second dinasaor to jump in this junk is the tarydactol. Now he has a longer scene than the tyranasaures with the fin. And it is also a better scene. They have to cross this bridge and on the other side the tarydactol comes and takes the boy to the nest and the bid goes back and forth getting people. Well they soon get out of that mess minus one person. Anyways you know when the movies over when they play that music and there on a plane ride home. Just like the first one. Remember in the first one Allan looks out his window and there is a bird. Well in this one there is a group of tarydactols flying by. Anyways I give this movie a four out of ten. Not for the stupidity but for the graphics which weren't much. So this is a pretty good mark. And the graphics are even better in the second film. Well if you want to see a really bad movie to top off the night. This hunk of junk fits perfectly.",Jurassic Park III
426,nilshenry,First half beautiful. Second half pathetic.,6,3 August 2001,"I will begin by mentioning the good thing about the movie: The opening is the most spectacular thing I have EVER seen in a movie. Honest to God, I felt tears coming to my eyes seeing (and hearing) it. This opening is enough of a reason for watching the film in the movie-theater instead of waiting for it to come out on video. It was great!The first half of the movie has a very interesting plot showing how Alan Grant has figured out more about the Raptors' way of communicating. At the same time he is scared to death only thinking about returning to the island in order to find out more about the dinosaurs, until a rich couple pays him to be their guide in an airplane guide over Isla Sorna. Of course the plane crashes.The director has added one creepy nightmare scene and some great action scenes throughout the film. The music and sound is loud and clear, and especially in the first half you get everything you expect from a good action-movie. However, when the plane crashes, everything changes.To show what Alan Grant meant about how the Raptors communicated, they have made the Raptors sort of Disney-like in their way of responding. In stead of being scary, they look cute. In addition, the entire rest of the movie is actually about how the dinosaurs can be very scary, but at the same time very fascinating. Hollywood can't leave a film without morals either, so the parents of the boy the crew is looking for are divorced, but I'll leave it to the reader to figure out for himself how the ending turns out. There's plenty of family values to «learn» from in JP3.However, what disappointed me the most, was the music. John Williams, the master composer of almost all the Stephen Spielberg films, made the music to JP1 and JP2, but this time they hired someone called Don Davis who made a wreck out of the whole Jurassic Park score, and almost made no original music of his own. There might have been some good arrangements of the beautiful John Williams theme, but they were not many.But, as I said in the beginning, I recommend that you see the movie, because it's one hell of an intro!",Jurassic Park III

Even if we already saw them, the same applies to the Pteranodons, that they were called into action this time. What I lack is the happening right at the beginning. We didn't experience what actually happened to the crew of the boat, therefore we eventually don't know what the very reason is for Eric's disappearance, why he was stranded on Isla Sorna.",Jurassic Park III

For me this fits into the shallow blockbuster group, where it could have been so much more.  How about a change of atmosphere for JP IV guys?

431,johnprestonevans,Godzilla Park,4,24 July 2001,"Joe Johnston took over the Jurassic franchise from Steven Spielberg with this third installment.  The beasties this time around have learned to talk. Sam Neil returns as Dr. Alan Grant - the paleontologist expert who discovers that those cunning raptors are the second smartest species on the planet.  Although you would not know it from the script, humans are still the most intelligent.  As with The Lost World, the first sequel, this movie revolves around another rescue mission.  This time William H. Macy and Tea Leoni play bickering parents carelessly drawn to the Costa Rican island where the dinosaurs still live (for some reason) to find their son who crash landed there.  The island is supposedly quarantined, but the boy hand glides over it, before loosing control and getting stranded.  Macy and Leoni are terrible in this film.  How they managed to convince Sam Neil's character to return to the island after his ordeal is ridiculous.  The effects are very good.  The dinosaurs give great performances, but the power of CGI creatures is loosing its luster.  Joe Johnston and team concox a new ""Spinosaurus"" carnivore, even more powerful than the blood thirsty T-Rex.  This new monster is like something out of Godzilla.  The filmmakers seem to believe that a bigger dinosaur with sharper teeth will bring new thrills to the audience, but there are very few thrills at all.  Flying Pteranodons attack the group in countless scenes of near death escapes.  There  is no character development, except for Macy and Leoni, who somehow find time to reconcile their dysfunctional marriage on the romantic Jurassic island (yes that is sarcasm).  The ""climax"" is so unbelievably ridiculous, that you will roll your eyes.  All I have to say is that no cell phone would work after traveling through the stomach acids of a dinosaur and coming out the other end.  Final rating = 4.0/10",Jurassic Park III

This film is taught, reasonably acted and written, and most importantly well paced. The first seemed to peak to me at the introduction of the T-Rex and then nothing really measured up after that. The second was fine as long as we were on the island but then we went to San Diego and well... This film stayed on track, built quickly and the action was non-stop. The story was believable (assuming that we have all suspended our disbelieve to accept the terms of the entire trilogy) and the cameo of Laura Dern was nice. The giant bird cage was very well handled and made the movie different enough from anything that we have seen in the other two. I also think that this opens things up for part IV and the potential of introducing underwater dinosaurs (think JAWS meets Loch Ness). Definitely the best of the three.",Jurassic Park III

The makers of the movie made very good dinosaurs! My favourite dinosaur in the movie was the Spinosaurus (I think). The Spinosaurus was very well represented,very powerful and PERHAPS better than the T-Rex that dominated the two first parts of the film! It was enjoyable, really, although I didn't find it VERY GOOD. But it is OK.The Spinosaurus acted very well in the film and it is the best dino movie that I have ever seen in Jurassic Park.I also realized that the Raptors changed a little bit of colour. It must have been done on purpose.But really, I can't believe that they can make such good animals.WARNING: it contains some blood!I thing you could be allowed to see it, at the moment that it doesn't scare you. They made such a huge spino and when you see it you must be like AMAZED!The Spino was the key to my happiness of enjoying the film.My favourite part of the movie was when the T-Rex had a battle against the Spino and it was very well done too.It is the best scene!I really wonder if there will be a Jurassic Park 4. It is still mystery.Anyway there is the actor Sam Neill who plays Dr.Grant again.I wonder why he was playing in the first one and the second time in the third one. Why wasn't he playing in the next part for example? There must be a reason. But anyway Jurassic ParkIII is still a succese for me!!! I really recommend it for the ones who love dino movies.

435,Dutch90,Misses Spielberg.,7,6 September 2005,"Now, I don't think JPIII is a bad movie, but it's certainly not a good one either, unlike its predecessors (many will disagree with me on The Lost World).The CG dinosaurs looked good, very good actually, but for some reason were a slight step down from the previous incarnations. The animatronics were also a little less than the ones in the predecessors. I didn't really like the revamped designs either. Sure, it's nice to keep your dinosaurs up-to-date to new scientific discoveries, but not when it contradicts the previous movies! The plot wasn't really as interesting either, overall the movie felt too small-scaled in comparison to its predecessors. I felt that the running time was too short, too.Now, there are also plenty of good things about JPIII. I liked to see Grant and Ellie again. The Spinosaurus, though unnecessary- they mistakenly thought the audience had grown tired of the good ol' T.rex- was an interesting and refreshing new addition, and the Spino/T.rex battle was nice. It wasn't overdone or stylized, which was good. Although in the end it was a bit unrealistic that the Rex's bone-crushing bite didn't kill the Spino. The aviary scene was definitely the height-point of the movie, it was well-directed and exciting.Aside from a not-so-great script, I think some of the bad things can be attributed to Steven Spielberg not directing. I know he doesn't always make good movies (never really cared for Hook), but I think JPIII would have been better than it is with Stevie in the director's chair rather than the producer's. Not that Joe Johnson is bad, though. I loved Jumanji.I liked JPIII enough to *buy* it on video, so I don't dislike it or consider it to be trash, but it could- and should- have been better. I'm still looking forward to IV, though.",Jurassic Park III

Let's face it, when people go to a dinosaur movie, what do they want to see?  Dinosaurs fighting people & eachother.  The first one seemed to have little of that element compared to the second, which incidently had the worst story of all.Simply put, Jurassic Park III is a dinosaur movie.  Lots of action, lots of dinosaurs, special effects which are top of the line, and just plain fun to watch.  In fact, Jurassic Park III only had enough story to put the people on the island.  This is to its credit.  I give Jurassic Park III, 9 out of 10 stars.  What can I say, I just had a darn good time while I was watching it.",Jurassic Park III
437,Bschorr,Too many toys...,7,29 July 2001,"After seeing A.I. and JP3 I'm starting to wonder if Steven Spielberg (only on-board as executive producer this time) hasn't gotten so enamored of the toys of movie-making that he's forgetting to make movies.  A.I. was visually spectacular, but none of the characters were very likeable or interesting. JP3 is one cool effects sequence after another -- the characters just marching from set-up to setup.Other than Sam Neill and maybe the kid none of the other characters in this movie really brought much to the screen.  William H. Macy is a terrific actor but he seems sadly out of place.  Tea Leoni is a good actress and a lovely lady, but she manages to be as asexual as possible in the role and the script didn't really give her much depth.That said, the movie is entertaining and aptly short -- it only runs about 90 minutes.  The directors thankfully resisted the temptation Spielberg gave into with A.I.; the temptation to keep going and going until the Special Effects guys got tired.  There are a few new dinos in this movie, the pterodactyl sequence is especially well done.The credits, ironically, state that the movie is based upon characters created by Michael Crighton -- but that's not true.  Clearly the movie is based upon characters created by evolution.  The humans in the movie are merely chum for the real stars to chase and eat.",Jurassic Park III

(Contains a few spoilers, if you haven't seen the movie, I wouldn't recommend reading this)",5,25 July 2001,"This movie starts out with, what i think, is a stupid plot for a ""Jurassic Park"" movie. A kid gets stranded on the island and his parents ""trick"" Dr. Alan Grant to help them look for their son. As the movie rolls on, new dinosaurs are discovered which makes no sense at all. Ingen had a certain ""list"" which Dr. Grant mentions, and certain dinosaurs which they see are not on this list. I expected this to be explained, how these dinosaurs came to be. Eventually the movie ends and nothing is explained. I was very surprised considering that this is a Jurassic Park movie. How could they not take time to explain anything? Another problem with this movie is the fact that it is only about an hour and 21-22 minutes, extremely short, don't you think so? The other 2 movies were each about 2 hours and 5 minutes. Another big thing, this is a Jurassic Park movie lets not forget, and the creators go and invent a dinosaur called the Spinosaurus. How can they invent a dinosaur for a Jurassic Park movie? Another stupid thing. I must say though that this dinosaur was incredible. 10 times more intelligent than the T Rex. I was dumbfounded when the T Rex went down in the fight between the Spinosaurus and the T Rex. One last thing, in the end of The Lost World, they show a few flying dinosaurs flying freely, then in this one, they show a giant bird cage which is never mentioned in the either of the previous movies, and wasnt site B just a place to nurture the baby dinosaurs? Why would they have built a whole bird cage for baby dinosaurs? And then not build the same thing on the original island. The writer of this movie should have thought this through more and most of all, Michael Crichton should have written a book for it, or it should not have been made, and they should have stuck with David Koepp as the screenplay writer. I think the movie would have been much better had he written it. But i must say there were some great scenes in this movie, but all in all, id say it was pretty bad.",Jurassic Park III
439,AdderCowley,Disgrace,5,6 March 2007,"How can a franchise fall so easily from grace? How can a film so completely turn its back on the premise of the franchise (and more importantly the books which structured it)? How can you screw up such a basic but entertaining idea? Well, Jurassic Park III does a pretty good job of the above.Starting off with this film butchering of the themes of the series. The whole idea of Jurassic park (the novel and subsequent films) was that it depicted the dinosaurs,for the first time, as normal animals not monsters. I mean Sam Neill in JP even explicitly stated this. The idea of life finding a way was draped all over the first film and The Lost World continued that on, however JP III does not follow this idea in a variety of ways: The Raptor's can communicate? The Spinosauraus has no incentive to attack the actors but it just does. The raptors are intelligent enough to let the main characters go free at the end but savagely kill anybody else who they believe have their eggs?Another instance of the slaughter of Jurassic Park is the look of the Dinosaurs themselves. Many are new or have been given a makeover and most look and act more aggressively than the previous films. (I mean the Brachiorsauraus went from a typical mottled green look to a red and green monster with sharp teeth?). On the DVD extras the people who worked on this film boast about how real the animals looked but I honestly didn't see that in the film. Apart from the fact that they jiggle and are fatter than before there is little inspiration. Come to think of it all the new dinosaurs appeared to be either red or green or a bit of both...However what really annoyed me (and it seems many others) was the killing of T-Rex and the emergence of Spinosauraus. They have a sort of Kenobi-Vader Showdown where T-Rex (the master who hunts only for the need for food) is killed by Spino (the learner who seems to rather enjoy chasing the people around and kill other dinosaurs for no reason. It is explained why they are chased by Spino but the reason is so pitiful its an obvious after thought. But getting back to the point, Killing off T-Rex? Big mistake. It has sparked quite a debate about who would actually win. From what I've heard Spino was bigger but T-Rex was designed to tackle large prey while Spino was more equipped for fish. No matter what some people may say about Spino being bigger that doesn't necessary mean it would be a better fighter...I mean a basketball player is bigger than a boxer but who would you pick in a fight? Although obviously for the makers of JPIII Bigger=Better. On a side note I wonder which T-Rex it was from TLW?As stated before little plot was involved in the film and being only 90 minutes long that is unsurprising. 90 minutes? Where did the suspense go from the previous two films? The reason for this? It's a non-stop action film, it is claimed. Fine if we're talking about a video-game movie but not for Jurassic Park. I look at it this way, on a pure entertainment level at least The Lost World has 30 minutes more value than JP III. The makers completely lost the focus of the franchise in this film.The makers to their cried did try to put in a little continuity i.e. the smashed windows of the car in the compound for example, as the film was based on the same island as TLW but it seemed poorly done. Why is the island so different from before? From wide open grassy plains and coniferous forests to tight claustrophobic jungles? A lot is left unexplained...And the raptors? That deserves an article on its own...Another stupid point was again the idea of kid being able to survive a situation where full grown adults with guns cannot. 8 weeks? When experienced mercenaries barely survive for 5 minutes? Especially when this kid is all arrogant and chuffed about his exploits on the island and would probably get eaten because his big fat head would get wedged in the tankers trap door:Boy: ""Oh look at meeeee I collected T-Rex urine. Aren't I the greatest?""Grant: ""How'd you get it?""Boy: ""Errr. (thinking fast), You don't want to know...""The final nail though was the death of Alan Grant. Not the man per say but the likability of the character. He was involved, he is now dead, a redundant entity in the franchise. One of the best characters in the series snuffed out in the blink of an eye, tainted by association to this atrocity. And speaking generally about characters, who actually liked the Kirby family or Billy?So in summary, no plot, no good characters, tired, bored acting, an annoying kid, killing T-REX? Disgrace.... I mean it just didn't feel like the survival orientated first two films, more a cheap monster film. The only positive is they continued to use moving models which is an almost forgotten method in cinema. But apart from that avoid like the plague.",Jurassic Park III
440,bornyesterdayandtomorrow,Not so bad after all.,6,25 February 2006,"I've watched Jurassic Park and Lost World more times than I can count, so I decided to watch this one. I was told that it really sucked, but I beg to differ. It doesn't suck, although it's not the best--it's good in parts.Paul and Amanda Kirby (Macy and Leoni) are a seemingly rich couple who hire Alan Grant (Neill) to give them a tour of the island. Little does he know, though, that they really want him to help find their son, that they're not as rich as they say, and that their son is on the island he never went to. Danger lurks on the island, ready to leap out at them and have them for dinnerincluding the mighty new creature that wasn't on the other island: a spinosaurus.(Funny line from Grant about not getting paidmade me think of the first movie, and the amount Hammond paid him.) Grant brings along Billy (Alessandro Nivola) because the whole ""coming along"" thing was his idea to begin with. They never showed this part, but that didn't bother me. I was just glad that Billy gets to go. Without him, the movie would've been less exciting.Two or three others go with them, which are eaten one by one. The surprising thing is that Ellie is on this one a bit, too, and she's married with kidsand not to Grant. Disappointing. I did know that they never married, though, because I read the books.Anyway, the ""main bad guy"" is a spinosaurus. Keep in mind that scientists aren't sure if they were quadruped or biped, due to uncertainty about the weight of the sail. They could've been that way. As for the raptorsdon't get me started on those. On all three, the raptor is portrayed as being big--which they aren't. Deinonychus is.Anyway, this movie isn't as bad as anyone says. It definitely has its parts, some of which are funny. Go watch it.",Jurassic Park III
441,pikespeak,GREAT FLICK! I WANTED MORE!!,9,23 July 2001,"The movie was wonderful.  I enjoyed the fact that the movie was too drawn out...it had a different look and feel, yet it was very good.  At the end of the film...it didn't leave you hanging...it left you wanting more of the film.  That is practically the only flaw in the film...it should have been 15-20 minutes longer.  This is probably why it got such good reviews...it didn't overstay its welcome.With talks of a 4th installment...I can't wait.Jurassic Park III has a good story, interesting characters, and a few good scares.  A nice treat for the summer for fans.

The first is my favorite movie of all time.  I mean it was a fantastic movie.  I felt the second was also good, but a lot of people didn't like it.  The third was awesome.  I still liked the first better, but I felt it was good.  I liked it about as much as the second.  Almost equal.  What can I say I gave all 3 of Jurassic Park movies 10 out of 10.  The are ultimately my favorite trilogy movies along with Star Wars.  If you want to see a good movie you should definitely see this one.",Jurassic Park III
443,grrrr97,Killing the Rex kills Jurassic Park,1,6 February 2005,"For me the T-Rex is Jurassic Park, Everything brilliant and groundbreaking about the First film revolves around the Rex. Jurassic Park was perhaps a critical flop, but it's importance regarding the incredible C.G.I must never be forgotten. Orginanly the dinosaurs where going to be brought to life using animated models(like Wallace and Gromit) for example only a tad more realistic obviously and full size anamatronic models, used in the T-Rex close ups. But Spielberg wasn't satisfied with the quality of the animation, despite Phil Tippert using the motion blur to make the movement of the models less static and more fluid. Then Tippet suggesting trials with C.G.I which was used for the first time by I.L.M in 85 on Young Sherlock Holmes, the rest as they say is history. The results in my opinion are awesome I am a great fan of stop motion animation particularly Ray Harryhausens, But the the first time I saw the Tyrannosaur rip down the fence I could'not breath. I'm work in the industry now and it was that scene more perhaps than any other film that made me want to work in film. The T-Rex is the star of Jurassic Park, the ending is probably one of my favourites of any movie, With the Rex saving the day at the last minute, Ripping apart the annoying Raptors. The spinosaurs is a joke, it's not only a incredibly stupid idea to introduce a dinosaur that wasn't even mentioned in the first two films or the books on a island no larger than 8 miles long, I would have thought we would have noticed it useless it was a incredibly shy 12 tons killing machine. But its not only the fact the appearance of the Spinosaurs is laughable, but it also breaks wind in the face of all the amazing work that was done on the first film. For me the T-REX is an Icon of groundbreaking visual affects, in the same way the original King Kong was at the time and later 2001 and star wars could be considered as landmark films effects wise also. The Rex is the Star of Jurassic park and is still probably the most popular dinosaur ever just ask your kids what their favourite is! So killing it off in the first half hour of what was a terrible, terrible film for me is nothing less than proof that Hollywood is slowly losing it's soul. Ignoring what films should be about Artistic expression and intelligent entertainment and instead it seems from an Englishmans point of view that the Art of film making is being destroyed my big company's who's sole motivation is earning money. And the constant stream of insulting re-makes and lame brain sequels flying out of Hollywood only gives weight to my argument.",Jurassic Park III
444,johnnybravo19852000,Dinosaur ca ca 1/2* out of 4,1,24 July 2004,"There is an old saying that a sucker is born every minute and after wasting $5.00 on this garbage proves me a statistic.Our only returning character from the first is Dr. Alan Grant (Sam Neil)who hasn't returned to the island and has no immediate plans to. He and Dr. Ellie Sattler (Laura Dern, who blink and you'll miss her) have broken up for reasons unexplained. As an attempt to structure some kind of story, a couple meets up with Grant to ask for help in rescuing their son who apparently disappeared on the island and in return they promise a big reward. Now lets think about this for a minute. You've stumbled on to someone you've never met before in your life and you have no idea of their finances. Since Grant agrees to risk his life, wouldn't it be wise to collect some of the money upfront as an insurance policy? But with a plot that gets dumber along the way, why bother.Now the obvious happens. The plane crashes on the island leaving the dumb folks stranded and virtually no way to call for help. A dinosaur attacks them and normally this would be exciting but hey, we already saw this in 1 & 2. Now for the real fun. The missing boys mom, (Tea Leoni) barely escapes death from a dinosaur but soon after wards is screaming her sons name out at the top of her lungs giving the invite for every dino alive to come and have her for lunch. But there is still 45 minutes left of this slop so of course, nothing happens.Eventually, Grant finds their son Erik who is really the only interesting character in the movie. He's fairly bright and considering how stupid his parents are, you figure he must have been adopted.One (and I mean only one) exciting scene are the flying lizards that the group encounters. This sequence works well until one guy is grabbed by a lizard causing him to plunge into the river but only to survive with only a minor bruise. (Some may feel I'm giving something away, but in a movie where everything is so utterly predictable, I doubt I've spoiled it for everyone)One of the many reasons that the 1st Jurassic Park worked so well is that it was like nothing we had seen before. Wonder kind Steven Spielberg didn't rely on cartoon animation to give us the eye popping effects. Every character was interesting and virtually all the situations were believable. Although the second was missing some of the thrills of discovery, Spielberg made it work.At only 85 minutes long, Jurassic Park 3 follows the many sequels that shouldn't have been made but it did what it was intended to do; grab a worldwide gross of $365 million and offer nothing in return.Note: Famous movie critic Roger Ebert gave the horrendous Jaws 4 a no star rating but gave Jurassic Park 3 a thumbs up. I think his other thumb was where the sun doesn't shine when he reviewed it.",Jurassic Park III
445,Buskieboy,Scarier than Jurrasic Park!,9,10 April 2006,"OK, so everybody is complaining about quality, plot etc. I agree, it seems far fetched and all that, but pound for pound this movie is MUCH scarier than JP. It has that giant Alasour (spelling?) and the T-Rex, etc. all in a very spooky rain forest kind of setting. I read ""Jurrasic Park"" about 6 times, and found the book much more intense, more scary and creepier than Steven Spielberg's movie version. They made a lot of significant changes from the book in that movie, not fatal but enough to notice if you read the book. They switched ages the kids, Lex and Tim, from the book. Also in the book the lawyer doesn't get killed, Dr. Wo is also on the island and gets eatten alive by the raptors. Hammond dies after falling down a large hill into the jungle and gets bitten to death by the compys (little chicken dinos, seen in movie #2, but not in #1). They cut out the whole section with the Terodactyl enclosure. This was one of the trials that faced Grant and the kids in the first movie, but they put it into this movie. It works fantastically! Now, not only do you have to watch out for raptors, T-Rex, Allasour, smaller RED t-rex's, but now the sky has 'em too! Not bad at all!",Jurassic Park III
446,Rapturous_Rich,"One minute you're marvelling at the advancements in technology, the next you're frowning at how shoddy it is",3,21 July 2008,"This film is so dire that I found myself writing this review before I'd even reached the halfway point, I was reminded of just how bad it is. There is one thing this film suffers from more than any other of its drawbacks, and that is a disease amongst the film industry known simply as Badfilmmakingitis. What, pray tell, could have caused this? And what are its symptoms? They differ from film to film.Symptom # 1: A clear knowledge that this island holds no real danger towards our heroes. Symptom # 2: The broken family which pulls together for the happy ending. Symptom # 3: Continuity errors regarding its predecessors. Symptom # 4: One word: overkill. Symptom # 5: That God-awful and down right ridiculous idea to have the satellite phone ringing from inside the Spinosaurus-a-gypsy-curse. Symptom # 6: Deciding to cast All Out Action in favour of Tension. Symptom # 7: The family friendly rating and content. If there's actually just one good thing to take away from this film it is this: the creatures themselves. Ingen's bad doings have been giving us resurrected dinosaurs since 1993 and with each outing they've looked better and better. They have been created quite beautifully in a mix of practical props and CGI fabrications. Their movements are undeniably majestic, even at their most hectic. But it is not enough to recover from the hour and half you'll undoubtedly feel somewhat insulted after. The raptors have lost that aura of pure menace they once had (who can forget ANY of their scenes in 1 and 2?!) and when they're not being chased by the punkosaurs, our band of 'heroes' are up against the new 'big boy on the block' ol' Spiney-back. These dinosaurs seem they're more from the ASBO generation of harassment than 65 million years ago, causing such provocative hassle for our cast within just ninety minutes.There is too much wrong with this film and although a few of the DVD special features provide some 'excuses' concerning the drastic change, it doesn't redeem the fact that it has detracted from the mysterious magic and awe of its forerunners. You can't help cheer at that agreeable punch Neill delivers to Macy after he realises he's been fooled, like us, into going onto that island again.Read the full review and more at www.wrawreviews.co.uk",Jurassic Park III
447,Gavin59,so many questions....,4,23 September 2008,"I gave this movie 4 stars only because I love the dinosaurs and the first two movies. I have tried to view JP3 as entertainment and not be cynical, but I have had a hard time because there are so many questions. 1.)If this is the same island as ""The Lost World"", where did the landing strip come from? 2.)Um, was the Spinosaurus hibernating in ""The Lost World""?If he was, that may make sense, but why has he not interacted with the Trex before? 3.)After 8 weeks, A teenage boy can defeat raptors AND save Dr. Grant who has survived an island of dinosaurs already? How did the boy get his food? If no one was on that island for 4 years, then the food in that trailer would be old and unedible....even beans. 4.)Why didn't Dr. Grant wait for the check to be cleared before he agreed to go to the Island? 5.) I would havebeen satisfied in the end if the families of the three men sue THAT IRRITATING COUPLE for causing the men to lose their lives, even though they agreed to go.

448,09322,A Trip Back to Isla Sorna,8,21 July 2001,"As in The Lost World, this movie takes place at the Isla Sorna.   Instead of Goldblum, JP3 brings back Sam Neill as the slightly grizzled Dr. Alan Grant who seems happy to put his terrifying up-close dino experiences behind him. But running out of funding and an offer of ""What would it take to get you to be our guide"", has him heading back to monster island.  The plot is a little thin, how 14 year old Eric Kirby (Trevor Morgan's first stint with dinosaurs was Barney's Great Adventure), could survive 2 months alone on an island of man eaters is a mystery , but the dinosaurs are phenomenal.  I didn't think anything could defeat a T-Rex.  The computer generated or mechanical creatures are so life-like,(although one of the dino fight scenes looks like a remake of something out of One Million, B.C.), you can almost buy into the illusion that they are real.

449,O.N.,"""Compact"" Fun",7,18 June 2002,"If I had to describe ""Jurassic Park 3"" in one word, I think ""compact"" would be the most appropriate word. With a run time of barely 90 minutes, the tiniest of plots and an almost smaller cast group, I could hardly think of a more appropriate description.In all honesty though, taking a ""compact"" approach to this film was probably a better idea rather than producing another overblown, over-long effort like ""The Lost World"".Let's face it, these films are never going to be oscar winners (except maybe for technical awards). They are just meant to provide sheer thrills and cheap, unchallenging entertainment. Without any meatier content, the best way to provide this is to keep it short and sweet and get us out of the cinema before the monotony of rampaging dinosaurs sets in.""Jurassic Park 3"", in a nutshell kicks off with Sam Neill's character from the first film heading back onto another dinosaur island with assistant Alesandro Nivola and ex-couple Tea Leoni and William H. Macy. The latter grouping's young son has been stranded on the island for 8 weeks after a hang-gliding accident and for some reason they believe he can survive this long against mobs of man-eaters. With a bit of ""coaxing"", our resident dino-duo end up joining them.This is where plotting ends. It doesn't take long for everything to go sour and before you know it everyone is alone in the jungle with more lurking predators than Arnie would ever be likely to face. From here on there are more loud shocks and close calls than you could imagine, with a large array of old faves and new dinos slicing and dicing from every direction.These setups are always what make the ""Jurassic Park"" films, and because this one keeps it so ""compact"", these moments aren't spoilt by unnecessary plotting, grandiose speeches or techno babble. All we are left with is the sweet dessert minus the distraction of the main course.In terms of cast, the four above-mentioned big names aren't really necessary, although they do have a pile of fun running around screaming and doing their best to attract dinosaurs. Everyone else is (unsurprisingly) dinosaur fodder and usually disposed of in inventive manners. What more could you ask for??On the down side, there is some sensationally dismal dialogue (""you're just as bad as the people who made these dinosaurs"") and the effects, although not terrible, don't have the same awe-inspiring quality as the same film.Still, as far as blockbusters go, ""Jurassic Park 3,"" thanks to its ""compact"" production style, generally hits the spot in entertainment value. The conclusion seems to hint that more is to come too. I guess the producers don't believe that the ""compact"" idea that  worked so well here applies to the rest of the series. Time will tell I guess.7/10",Jurassic Park III
450,Teewurstmann,what took them 4 years for this one?,3,16 July 2001,"I was very disappointed by JP3. The special effects were great, but the movie didn't have a plot, didn't have a story to it. Ok, the boy is lost on the island, but they find him after the first couple of minutes. So, what is left? The thrilling, very creative and interesting task of.... reaching the coast. They meet a couple of dinosaurs on the way and hardly anyone gets killed. No background story. They tried to make it interesting by the fact that the raptors can talk to each other, but they never really used it. The raptors just looked at each other, screamed a little, and ran off. The movie had hardly any suspense. And it ended too quickly. There was no highpoint or anything. They reached the coast and the movie was over.I was very disappointed and so was my wife.If they make a JP4 they should give a really interesting plot, like set it 100 years in the future and there's a Jurassic Park in every major city, or Dinosaurs are used as working-animals and revolt or something. There are so many possibilities, but JP3 didn't use any of them.The only thing I liked was the ""ringing"" Dinosaur. That was funny.",Jurassic Park III

Predictably, the plane crashes, and they have to get off. The plot is a bit more complex than that, but not much.

This is yet another example of that phenomenon. JURASSIC PARK III is a good movie. I don't think it is a good as the first but it is certainly better than the second and the dinosaur footage might well be considered the best yet. This is a straight adventure/rescue story. Sam Neil is hoodwinked into returning to the isle of dinosaurs to act as a ""tour guide"". He is only supposed to narrate what is seen from a plane that will never land. As it turns out, the plane does land and the purpose of landing is to search for a lost boy. The good doctor was shanghaied because the parents of the boy wanted someone with experience running from large carnivores. By the end of the film, everyone has plenty of experience. If I had one real complaint about this one it is the suspiciously good timing of the marines who turn up to save the day. That didn't destroy the story, though. By the time that happens, everything is pretty much over. As with the second in the series, there are plenty of new dinosaurs at which to marvel.

But anyway Sam Neill was good and that guy Billy was cute.Tea Leoni's character was really annoying and not that I'm a feminazi or anything but I kinda thought that was sexist.Oh yeah I forgot the dinosaurs were amazing! They are the best part, very good. I liked the way they put Barney in there to show the comparison in that one scene.",Jurassic Park III

460,pylgrym,Spoiled ROTTEN!,9,6 August 2005,"Just watched this movie again for the umpteenth time, as I get psyched up for Peter Jackson's ""KING KONG"" this December. In ""JPIII"" I get to pretend that I am like Ray Harryhausen at 13 in 1933, at Graumann's Chinese Theater in Hollywood, mesmerized by Max Steiner, awed by O'Brien, delighted by Delgado - filled with that childhood-verging-on adolescent sense of wonder - like I don't want my childhood ever to end. In ""JPII"" I get to do that as often as I like. And I like. I like to pretend now and then, even at the tender age of 55. I pretending to be 13; I like watching grown men in rubber suits running around on a miniature jungle or city set pretending to be dinosaurs as much as I like the idea of grown men hiding behind the fake scenery, running a one thousand horsepower hydraulic Spinosaur. I like the idea of a lone effects genius spending half of his professional career moving a puppet or two painstakingly, thoughtfully, irrevocably - for one frame of film at a time in a small studio on a tabletop in front of a projection screen, so that millions of people can have their childhoods preserved.... Sure: any thirteen year old knows how it's done. Any thirteen year old in 2005 knows fantasy from reality, and most kids are creating their own stories in Playstation and XBox or on their own thousand-dollar personal computers every day. I've done it myself on a great interstellar planetoid called HALO. But how many of us can pretend? Pretend to have our youth back, even for 92 minutes? But that's the whole point. We are SPOILED ROTTEN! ""JPIII"" did ninth best in America in 2001 in domestic box office grosses. In the year of ""Harry Potter"", ""The Fellowship of the Ring"", ""Shrek"", ""Monsters, Inc."", ""Rush Hour 2"", ""The Mummy Returns"", ""Pearl Harbor"" and ""Ocean's 11"", it's a wonder the third installment beat the Burton blockbuster remake of ""Planet of the Apes""! There was so much up there on the screen that year that it was clearly a case of sensory overload and limited funds. In fifty years, the ""JP"" franchise will still be holding its own up there with the best of 'em; there will always be those like me willing to suspend our disbelief for a few precious moments and allow ourselves to be transported, spoiled rotten, into lost worlds.",Jurassic Park III
461,marcferrantejr,Jurassic park III Review,3,24 December 2015,"I'm a huge fan of the Jurassic Park franchise. I loved the original and The Lost World, I did think Jurassic World was a bit disappointing but it was still a good movie. Jurassic Park III on the other hand is an embarrassment to this franchise. When I watch a movie I review it based on the acting, directing, cast, camera angles and the budget. If it weren't for this movie having the name Jurassic Park in it, I think Jurassic Park III would be considered one of the worst movies ever made. It isn't directed by Steven Spielberg it's directed by Joe Johnston who only has made one good movie which was October Sky. The main problem with this movie is that it seemed rushed and unfinished. The thing I loved about The Lost World is that Steven Spielberg tried to make it different than Jurassic Park, the problem with Jurassic Park III is that it's just trying to get Sam Neill back on the island and feels like a cheap version of the original. There are just so many moments where your thinking to yourself ""they actually put that in the movie"" or ""They thought that was a good idea?"". The animatronics in this movie are bad too! It's crazy to me that a movie that came out in 1993 has better CGI and animatronics than the one that came out in 2001. Besides Sam Neill's character Alan Grant everybody in this movie is flat and boring and has no emotion whatsoever. It's 30 minutes shorter than Jurassic Park and The Lost World and there isn't even a main antagonist in this movie. A spinosaurus is on the poster of this movie so you would assume that they are being stalked by a spino right? No that thing appears like 3 times and just chases them into an area where they can hide from it. Alan Grant is also going crazy because he is obsessed with raptors or something, I don't know it's very unclear. There's a dream sequence on a plane where Alan sees a raptor sitting next to him and it says his name. That was one of those wtf moments in this film. Here is a quick fun fact before we wrap up, they started filming this movie before the script was finished. That explains a lot. This movie is truly terrible and if your thinking of buying the Jurassic Park trilogy on Blu Ray or something don't waste your money. Just buy Jurassic Park and The Lost World separately. This thing is one of the worst sequels ever made and one of the worst movies ever made. The final grade for Jurassic Park III is an F.",Jurassic Park III
462,mbloyd,Lightning doesn't strike thrice,5,29 August 2016,"The minds behind this installment of the franchise didn't mess with the formula, so there's nothing fresh or surprising. If the formula is what you want, this big spectacular doesn't disappoint. Neither Steven Spielberg nor Michael Crichton showed up, but the movie could've written and directed itself. The bad news: Despite the contributions of Alexander Payne, the characters and script are strictly by-the-numbers and the sentimental goo that justifies the mayhem is poured on thick. Anyone who isn't bitten in half by a dinosaur grows as a person, and a broken family is reassembled amid the running and screaming. The good news is the dinos: Rather than rely solely on CGI, the movie features full-scale animatronic props constructed by Stan Winston.",Jurassic Park III
463,jamiepaton-33876,One of the worst movie sequels...ever,2,10 August 2018,"To put it simply, I hate Jurrassic park III. The plot is mind numbingly boring. The acting is god awful and the cgi, even for 2001 standards, is atrocious.Lets start with the plot...Why is it so boring and dumb? The whole premise is, this couples son got stuck on an island in a parachuting incident and they want to go on a dinosaur infested Island to get him back. They promise to give Alan Grant (The only good thin about this movie) a load of money to help et the boy of the island. One thing that's always bothered me is how come he wasn't eaten. The first thing that happens when his parents and Alan Grant come on the island is them getting attacked. How come this boy who has been there for quite some time has not been eaten? It makes no sense and the plot just gets worse and worseThe acting in this movie, with the exception of Sam Neil, is some of the worst ever. Téa Leoni plays Amanda Kirby and it is honestly torture to watch. Constantly over acting and screaming constantly. William H. Macy is okay but if they would've bothered to at least try and get some decent people to work on this film instead of making it for money's sake we wouldn'tall have to sit through this atrocity.I loved Jurrassic Park and I really liked The Lost World. This movie just goes to show that bringing back the main character from the first movie doesn't make the movie good. I actually prefer Kingdom of the Crystal Skull over this. No wonder Steven Spielberg didn't come back to direct this one.The writing in this movie can actually be okay at times. But for the most part it's not different it's what we have seen 100 times before. The first 20-30 minutes before they even get to the Island is more entertaining than the rest of the movie.I really wanted to love JP III but in the end I really hate it.",Jurassic Park III

I saw a fully imagined world with seamless (for that time) computer-generated dinosaurs.By the second movie much of the magic was gone to be replaced with Saturday-afternoon-matinee action. And by the third, I simply couldn't get involved with any of the characters.CGI can enhance a movie if there's a story. But if you can't identify with the story you can't identify with the CGI, except to notice its professionalism. The actors for the most part did a good, professional job. But they couldn't act past the limitations of the script or the limitations of the story.Unfortunately, JP III is one of the movies where I kept glancing at my watch and waiting for 90 minutes to pass. I suspect it might be better suited to video than to a theater, since part of the theater experience is audience participation, and audience participation was painfully lacking during this movie.",Jurassic Park III

Well I was way wrong about that in the fact that it is by far better then 2 but still not as good as the first one but then very few movies are as good as the first.  The acting in this movie was far more belivable then 2 and the Special effects were awsome  If you like Dino movies then this is deffenitly for you and if you say I don't want to watch it because 2 sucked then go watch it and you will be supprised it's very good could be a little longer though.

468,ekwillow,Almost as good as the original,8,19 July 2001,"All I have to say is I'm proud to be a big fan of the Jurassic Park movies. I was so afriad that I wouldn't like this movie because the second sequel never is good in a lot of series but I loved this one!!  It really blew me away with all the non-stop action.  it seemed like chase after chase after chase and it really kept you on the edge.  Even though a lot of people say that it was more the same and they didn't develop the characters good enough.  WHO CARES about the characters!!!  They developed them good enough here without using too much detail.  What you expect in a Jurassic Park movie is scary and suspenseful moments and thats exactly what you get in this one.  All the actors on the island were great.  I even think WIlliam H. Macy almost stole the show with his humor.  And Sam Neil, as always, did great as Dr. Grant.  I loved Jurassic Park!!  Lost World wasn't bad at all! But Jurassic Park 3 was awesome!!  But I don't think no sequel can be as better as the original. I also like to add that I was very impressed with Joe Johnston's direction to the movie.  It made me kept thinking that Spielberg was still directing this.  That's how good he did.  I  really recommend to this sequel to the Jurassic Park fans who expect a lot of action and humor.  If you don't then I don't think you will like this one!!!!  Now I read that they want to make a Jurassic 4.  Now even though I don't think thats a good idea I'm still gonna see it because  it might surprise me like Jurassic Park 3 did to me.",Jurassic Park III

The film allows for the passage of time, the current robust research (some of which can be attributed to the JP phenomenon), and the unfolding knowledge gained in real time since JPI.Undoubtedly, some of the film's harsher critics have not seen this film; they place characters in the wrong plot line or location, and they completely overlook a few fine satiric comments on pop culture and modern conveniences.

471,jaredmartin-464-711711,Jurassic Park 3 is as Inventive as it's title.,6,1 July 2015,"Jurassic Park 3 was released four years after the Luke warm reception of Spielberg's (underrated) The Lost World. Spielberg opted to not return to helm another Jurassic film, and directing duties were passed over to Joe Johnston. Jurassic Park 3 see's the return of Sam Neill as Dr. Alan Grant, from Jurassic Park. Laura Dern also returns as Ellie Sattler, but sadly in a less prominent role. The story for JP3 is quite simple, Grant is lured by ""adventurous"" couple Paul, & Amanda Kirby, played by William H. Macy & Tea Leoni, to fly over Isla Sorna, with Grant acting as their guide, for money. However the Kirby's are not rich, and lied to Grant so he could help them find their missing son Eric, who wen't missing weeks ago in a parasailing accident near the island. Of course things go wrong, the plane crashes leaving the Kirby's, Grant, his colleague Billy, and a few others stranded on the island. JP3 can only be enjoyed as a trilling dinosaur spectacle, but there isn't much of anything new, or interesting.There are some positives aspects in this film, Sam Neill is a fine actor, and he brings credibility to the film, and is still believable as the Grant character. While the rest of the characters aren't all that fleshed out, the film is well acted, with William H. Macy, and Sam Neill being the standouts. There's a few new dinosaurs, Spinosaurus being the main one. Spinosaurus is a neat dinosaur, and the roar for Spinosaurus is also well executed, and is distinctly different sounding from the now famous T- Rex roar. The animatronic dinosaurs/CGI are once again well executed by Stan Winston's team, and Industrial Light & Magic (ILM). JP3 is the first film in the series to combine CGI dinosaurs along with practical ones in the same shot, and the blending between the two is well done. The Spinosaurus attack on the river is a thrilling scene, taking place in water, which hadn't been done. There is also a thrilling Pteranodon sequence, offering a ariel attack which hasn't been seen yet in the franchise. The scene is dimly lit, with fog, and creates the best sense of suspense in the movie. The music in the scene is probably my favorite bit of new music in the film. John Williams didn't score JP3, instead composer Don Davis best known for his work in The Matrix films, provides the music, and does a good job, creating new music that still fits stylistically within the franchise.Though there are positives in JP3 there are many negatives as well. One of the biggest ones I had was the screenwriters not having Grant, and Ellie as a couple. Instead they have a friendship type relationship, and Ellie has a child (with some random guy) who call's Grant ""the dinosaur man"". It just seems stupid to not have Grant be with Ellie after the events of the first film. Grant's character arch of not wanting children changes after he saves Lex, and Tim, and is seemingly ready to settle down with Ellie, which now seems wasted. The dumbest thing about it is it adds nothing to the characters, or the overall film, and was a stupid decision on the writers part. Grant has a dream on the plane nearing the island, and turns to see a raptor that says ""Alan"". The scene is very cheesy, and really is just plain silly, right up there with the gymnast scene in TLW. The Spinosaurus T-Rex fight is neat, but having the T-Rex (a fan favorite) lose, and die, just didn't sit right with many fans, myself included. The characters (while well acted), aren't all that interesting, or all that likable, the Kirby's put peoples lives in danger to find their son, and Billy, decides it would be a good idea to steal raptor eggs to help fund their research back home. There are also many continuity issues in the film, like why the island doesn't look the way it did in TLW, or why the raptors look radically different (some have feather-like quills on their head) from how they did in the pervious films. Where the Spinosaurus was during the events of TLW is suspicious too, the only clue given in the film is when Grant says that Spinosaurus wasn't on Ingen's list. Perhaps the worst part of JP3 is it's ending, which feels insanely rushed, and anti-climantic, almost as if the filmmakers said ""This is going on too long, lets wrap it up"", but with a runtime just over 90 minutes, the abrupt conclusion seems strange, with the previous films being over two hours long. Jurassic Park 3 despite is faults, and there are multiple ones, is still an enjoyable flick for what it is, but it's a huge step down in terms of story, and character, and is just an unnecessary edition to the franchise. The story isn't very interesting, or inspired, and the only thing new in the film are the look of the raptors, and a few new dinosaurs. It's explained during a dinner scene with Grant, and Ellie that the raptors were far more intelligent than imagined, and could talk to each other, but much of this could be assumed in the previous films. Spinosaurus makes for a cool looking successor to T-Rex, but seems more like a movie monster than an animal, compared to T-Rex who while running around chasing/eating people, had moments in both Jurassic Park, and The Lost World that showed a naturalistic side of them, like caring for the infant T-Rex. The only real advances in Jurassic Park 3 are technical ones, but effects aren't what makes a film great, it's the story, and characters that drive a film, and that wasn't strong enough in this entry of the Jurassic Park series.",Jurassic Park III

It looked promising but i was sad it wasn't Speilberg.The trailer made me even more excited.  The movie looked action packed.  The movie was mediocre and like the second one it had its good points.  But two things upset me.  First of all the movie was way to short.  I believe it was around 90 min. and it went by really fast.  Near the end of the movie my brothers friend leaned over and said, ""their is only 20 min. left"" and the movie seemed like it just started.  Another problem with the movie were the trailers and t.v. spots.  They ruined the whole movie.  They gave away every scene, there was nothing i wasn't expecting.

Perfect spot for being in the middle of the fight scene between the TRex and the Spinosaurus (was there actually ever such a beast?). The pterodactyl flying scenes were pretty good that close up, too. I went with the kids - maybe dragged by the kids - with low expectations. After the disappointing 'Lost World', I was expecting the series to end; put out of its misery. But I was surprised. I thought the 'human contingent' performed adequately for what is intended to be a cloned dinosaur action movie... I mean the computer graphics are really what this series is about. Let's not kid ourselves with high expectations in the character development dept. It was good to have Dr. Grant back, as well as Dr. Sattler (albeit briefly). I enjoyed William Macy's character. If folks were looking for some comic relief, he offered some; maybe no guffaws, but some warm-hearted moments. And okay, maybe the plotline was thin, but after the cloning aspect is played out in the first movie, what do you do? Get some people onto the island(s) and have them cavort with the dinosaurs, big and small, meat-eating and herbivores. There's not a lot you can do with the set-up to begin with.

However, out of the three, it is this third film that remains my favorite.The plot is simple. Sam Neill's Dr. Grant character is lured back to the island by a couple who's kid is stranded there. The film is fast, the dialogue stays on course, there is just enough room to segue into side plots without overdoing it, and everyone seems to be rolling along. William H. Macy and Tea Leoni are fine as the couple looking for their kid, and Alessandro Nivoli is also good as Billy, Dr. Grant's protégé here.The film doesn't ask you to think, but manages to keep your attention.

Personally I enjoyed this movie for all the reasons most other people seem to despise. The direction, story, and risks. The raptors are advertised intelligent in the this film, making it a large point to note they're ability to communicate. And evidence supports in favor that deinonychus, which has to be what the Jurassic Park movies are portraying as velociraptors, were capable of this. Furthermore I believe it's the first time one of the dinosaurs were actually a main character. An argument could be made about that but personally I believe a true main character has to show intelligence and emotion. The iconic T-Rex in the previous films was just an animal, a supporting character at best, which is okay and it was entertaining. Speaking of, dispatching Tyrannosaurus was bold, daring, and took on a lot of criticism but I think it paid off, making room for a real predator. Acting was decent and the plot was fine, despite taking major fire from a lot of people. All and all a good film, don't let poor ratings shy you away, this film is definitely fun. My theory, just because it wasn't exactly the same thing people wanted to burn its reputation and found reason not to like it that just aren't there.

You're either to enjoy it for it's action and fun factor or you're going to compare it to the 1993 classic and dislike it for it's lack of originality. The plot is rather simple, so I'll give it to you in one sentence. Four years after TLW Alan Grant is coaxed into flying over Isla Sorna by two parents searching for their lost son. Joe Jonston did a good job with what he had. The script was ok, but it was written at the last minute. Some of the acting is good, but some isn't. Sam Neill is always great. He gave Grant, the perfect cynical nature as he was the only one who been through this before. Macy was pretty good, but some of his lines fell flat. Leoni was ok, but she seemes a little out of place as did Michael jeter. The supprting cast was good, but some were not even given enough time to prove themselves. The plot is paper thin and 84 minutes(without credits) is short for A jurassic Park. But it is the perfect summer popcorn movie. Action, adventure, and a little darkness help the movie. Now, when compared to the first one, it certainly doesn's measure up, against TLW, it possibly lacks, but it qualifies as a big B movie. If you like one and two, give it a shot, you'll either love it or hate it. Recently Spielberg has been talking of Jurassic IV having an incredible base story.

481,Hugo_diaz,"At Last!, This is the real and expected Jurassic Park 2. contains spoilers )",7,29 August 2001,"When I saw Jurassic Park, back in 1993, I thought: ""Oh my God, What a movie"". It was unbelievable, not an Oscar competitor, but it was ok. Then I was hoping for the sequel. 4 years later I could see The Lost World: Jurassic Park. And then I cried. I couldn't understand how My dearest filmmaker ever had passed from great creativity and first level suspense and real Science fiction (I mean Real Science fiction) to a pseudo ecological stupid tale. I just couldn't stand it. A great disappointment. Then, in 1999, Mr. Lucas did the same with The Phantom Menace, and I realized it was a sort of Hollywood disease. In those days I thought Jurassic Park' franchise is dead. Then appears JP3 and... ¡Surprise!, It was like to be looking back 1993. It was a thrill. What a pity Jurassic Park III is so underestimated. It's not going to be as box-office-success as The Lost World. I was pleased this sequel was 30 minutes shorter, though. It kept all simple. It has no villains, dinosaurs were leading characters again. It was not ambitious at all. In fact, my favorite scenes were those in which characters were not even in the island: 1)When Dr. Grant asks for money for his research, and the audience just want to know about Jurassic Park and the San Diego's incident. 2)When talks about his theories with Lovely Dr. Sattler. 3) That wonderful sequence comparing a huge dinosaur and that stupid purple one named Barney. (That was hilarious!). I think It was amazing to watch also Alan Grant's dream sequence. It was unexpected and dared. JP3 it has value of its own, and I agree with all who said that this is the real sequel and that The Lost World should not have been made. This is one of the greatest Third part sequel ever.

But at the end of the day it's not THAT bad as some of the other reviews may claim, and is still quite fun and jumpy in places (though maybe less screaming by the woman would have been nice!) The film did have great parts to it that maybe could have been used in the first and second to give us a longer feature for those instead (and stay away from mainland cities too!) Overall, it's got dinosaurs. It's a bit of fun, and it'll pass the time on a rainy day. It's also a good starting point for kids and dino films as it's the mildest of them all.",Jurassic Park III
484,catheter1st,The Most Logical Result When You Add Jurassic Park 1 and 2 Together,8,11 June 2007,"Is Jurassic Park 3. In short, Jurassic Park 1 was a masterpiece, perfectly executed, and likely never to be topped by any sequel. Jurassic Park 2 was an attempt to recreate the same dramatic awe and inspiration that was generated in audiences with the first Jurassic Park. It was poorly executed and easily topped by the following sequel, Jurassic Park 3.Why is this? Because the logical step, after the studio had created a cinematic masterpiece about dinosaurs, should have been to get right down to the nitty-gritty about dinosaurs living in the 20th-21st centuries, which would be 'They Effing Eat People!' That is the big difference between JP 3 and the predecessors. It skips the whole dramatic, scientific tedium, and gets right into the larger-than-life Spinosaurus eating human flesh, dominating the T-Rex, and creating an atmosphere of chaos. This is what dinosaur movies should be like now that JP1 has taken care of all of the dramatic awe and wonder parts of this. Lets see the dinosaurs draw people into their habitat, and consume them! After 90 minutes I have had enough anyhow.The makers are never going to get another Oscar for making dinosaur movies(most likely). So give the people what they want! My only regret is they continue to leave the violence in the pg-13 limbo. I want R-rated fountains of blood! Seriously though, this is a great popcorn movie with lots of action and thrills, which doesn't have a long meandering plot to drain you and your child's brains. This deserves a higher rating in my opinion.",Jurassic Park III

The flying scenes with the parachute hand glider was really beneath what one would expect from a top notch special effects movie.  It didn't look real at all.

God bless him for that.The dialogue is neither brilliant nor teeth-clenchingly stupid; it's merely adequate to move the simple plot along.  Don't expect to be enriched intellectually after leaving, but damn if I didn't have a good time!

But, the movie was everything it promised to be:  A superbly crafted, action-packed, rocket of a movie.  It was fast paced, and the action hardly lets up, maybe for just a few minutes for you to catch your breath, and then you're hit right slam in the face with another dynamic action scene.  The movie is only 95 minutes long, and about 75 of those minutes are nothing but thrills and scares.  Yes, the movie is too short, but it's hardly a problem. It leaves you wanting more and that is a sure sign of a great movie.  Just don't get your hopes up, thinking this is going to be as good as the first, because it isn't.

When Speilberg tried the sequel (which was mediocre at best) 'The Lost World' was simply a ridiculous insult to the fans of 'Jurassic Park'.  Thankfully- that wrong has now been corrected.Jurassic Park III is not a Speilberg movie, it is not a Michael Chrichton story.  It is pure Hollywood, and for once, Hollywood did something right. Hollywood remembered that what made the first JP movie wasn't the real-ness of the dinosaurs- it was that the movie was scary!  Part III has some of the scariest moments of the trilogy.  It's a scary movie, and the writers brought the story back to the basics.  It's a resuce mission.  It's got scary dinosaurs, unlike it's predessessor 'the lost world' with the ridiculous T.Rex in San Diego.The new dinosaur of course is king of the movie.  The ""Spinosaurus"" scenes will genuinely scare you!  If you've read the Chrichton books, you will recognize that the writers of JP3 stole and adapted some scenes from both books for the film.

The only thing i didn't like about it is there was not enough of the t-rex one scene that really stinks.But the flying dinosaurs make up for it they are cool too. The kid trevor morgan does a pretty good job for a child, cause you rarely see a child do good in a movie (proving it STAR WARS episode one.) I am so glad it wasn't that gruesome except the blood on the plane windows, but still it is a lot less blood than the first two. And another bad thing is the raptors are too smart, in this movie it makes the raptors look smarter than the humans, no offense to those humans. Overall this is a great movie 9/10 which is very good.

A 9 is excellent and a 10 is excellent and a classic. There are only a couple of movies I give 10's to so consider my rating in that sense.From the start I liked the way the movie was filled with suspense and stomach wrenching scenes.  It had a good balance of highly volatile scenes and some calming, slow your heart down scenes.  The balance is set for an action movie so there are a lot more suspenseful scenes than slower ones.It's not easy finding a good plot that will bring us back to the island where the dinosaurs were created.  There had to be a real reason to go back and something different to see when we got there.  Jurassic III filled the bill.The special effects were terrific!  I watched ""The Making of Jurassic Park III"" after seeing the movie and found myself admiring it even more.  The work that went into it was astounding in order to give us, the audience, the feeling that what we were watching was real.  Make sure you watch the bonus material if you get the DVD.This could be my favorite of the three Jurassic Park movies.  I know I can watch if more than a couple of times without getting sick of it.

495,tanis_38,Great fun but had potential to be more......,7,20 July 2001,"I was expecting the worst going into Jurassic Park III.  After the abomination that was The Lost World, all my expectations for any sequels were pretty low.  Being a huge fan of the first one, I was already prepared to have the series plummet into mediocrity, destroying the integrity of the first film.  Despite my low expectations, or maybe because of them, I thoroughly enjoyed this movie.  As the movie opened, and I heard the familiar JP theme music, I knew it was already a step in the right direction, seeing as The Lost World was practically void of  the great compositions John Williams established in the first movie, this was a refreshing surprise.  Of course as is the case with many summer `blockbusters', anyone looking for a deep story and complex characters need not apply.  This movie solely relies on it CG dinos to deliver the goods; and that they do.  It cuts right to the chase and gets the human prey...uh, I mean characters, straight to the island without delay.  And that's when the fun starts.  While the first movie set up it's action sequences with building suspense and tension, this movie mostly just throws them at you in large quantities.  The sequences are fast and exciting, with some truly amazing special effects and sound assaulting on you senses.  While the action is great, a lot of about the movie is a little hard to swallow.  A little more realism would have been much appreciated and would have been a nice change of pace from the usual predictable Hollywood formula.  I'm sick of the `separated couple get thrown together under extreme circumstances and rekindle their love' angle.  It's been done to death.  Speaking of death, there should have been a lot more of it.  Ok, so the movie is PG-13, but I don't mean it had to be a blood bath, but I have to figure that if you get all these humans stranded on an island overrun with dinosaurs, they have no weapons or shelter and are supposed to be facing these `super intelligent' velociraptors, you'd think at least half of them would become dino-food right?  And I don't buy the kid surviving on the island by himself for 8 weeks.  The ending also leaves much to be desired.  It seemed very anti-climactic and leaves you expecting more, some sort of grand finale that never comes.  Ok, so far it seems like I didn't enjoy myself at all watching this movie, which isn't true, I actually had a great time.  But being such a huge fan of the first one, after watching this movie it made me realize that this movie had the potential to be so much more.  It seems like the studio has become complacent and isn't trying very hard.  The ending also hints that a sequel might be in store for us in the future.  I'm not too sure if one should be made.  While part of me can't get enough of seeing these CG dinos battle it out on screen, unless this series takes a drastic turn in the right direction, it might end up being nothing more than another Friday the 13th.  I really hope that doesn't happen. This movie is sort of a catch 22 for me; I had a great time watching it, but since I actually enjoyed myself as much as I did,  made me wonder how much better it could have been if it's flaws were fixed.  After all is said and done, the next day at work I recommended it to everyone I spoke to.  So while nowhere near the caliber of the first movie, it runs circles around the second.

When the first movie came out i was barely hitting puberty, but ever since, i could rely on the movie for an escape to the fantasy world that Spielberg took our imaginations a step further, into the mysteries of the land of the dinosaur.  Despite some far fetched factual fallacies, overall Jurassic Park III, was a fun filled film.  (i'm kinda tired right now so bear with me)  I thought the humor was cute, and although the plotline and scenes of dramatic irony were simple, the movie did its job: to entertain.

Then came it's sequal, and it was down-right horrible. It was Slow, Corney and stupid. But than came Jurassic Park 3! It was so much better than both of them. The Special effects were just about the best ever (once again), But this time they also put in a plot. Well, I can't say the others were mindless, but they didn't have the twists and turns that this one does! The action sequences were superb! Most notibly in the ""bird cage"". Just breath taking. And while just about every aspect of this movie is so impossible it's corney (like surviving the plane crash and Raptors being able to communicate like they did), this is a FICTION movie. People don't seem to realize that. Just swallow hard and accept it rather than complaining about it. It is deffinatly a highlight of this year as far as movies go, and just barley out of reach of my top 10. It is VERY funny, Exciting, filled with awesome special effects and Breathtaking sceneary and even a little dramatic love interest, which doesn't flood it, but just enough to keep things interesting.

499,kinetsmac,This Dino Franchise Has Lost Most Of It's Bite,5,27 September 2007,"There comes a point in any franchise life where the sequels cease to be about good storytelling and become primarily about making money. This tradition goes back as far as Edgar Rice Burroughs Tarzan novels (Mr. Burroughs also wrote the original ""Lost World,"" interestingly), can be seen in more recent series like ""Jaws,"" and makes it's presence known in the modern day with the seemingly endless ""Saw"" movies.Jurassic Park III does not break from this tired and true money making ideal, but in it's defense it does aim a little higher than many of its fellow putrid ""III"" movies. Sam Neilson returning to his role as Alan Grant is definitely a treat, and most of the other actors in the film do a fair job at their respective rolls as well. As is expected from the franchise, the dinosaur CGI looks fantastic (though it still lacks that certain edge that T-Rex scene in the first movie had. Fellow fans will know what I'm talking about,) and there are plentiful scares to be had from the dinosaur islands more voracious inhabitants. Unfortunately however, this is where the good of the movie ends, and the bad starts to begin.The film opens with a man and a young boy going para sailing (at least I think that's what it's called. It involves a boat, a rope, and a glider, so forgive me if I called it wrong) over a beautiful sea with a tropical island in the backdrop. Can you guess where this is going? Yep, that island is none other than Isla Sorna, Site B itself. What this guy is doing taking his son para sailing next to one of the most dangerous islands on earth is beyond me, and it's one of the weak points in the plot. Which is bad, considering its the frigging OPENING of the plot. As you might expect, something goes wrong, the father and son crash on the island, and the game is afoot.To sum up the following events for you, the boys mother and divorced former father hire Alan Grant, under the fake pretext that they're owners of a major corporation just wanting to go on a tour of Dinoland, to be their guide of the islands habitat (so they can find their lost son.) Alan takes his ""ward"" with him, I don't even remember his name (you won't either) and before long the whole bunch is on a flight into the bowels of hell itself. Needless to say, things go the way of a T-Rex turd pretty much after the plane lands on the islands moss covered runway, with half the ""professional"" mercenaries hired with them dead in ten minutes and everyone is running for their lives. Major Spoilers!: While the things mentioned above aren't exactly terrible (if not uncreative), than heres a quick list of the things that ARE:The kid is found alive, after being alone on the island for weeks, without even a sign of psychological damage no less (I know I'd start to go a bit batty if I was alone in a jungle full of murderous reptiles.) Way to be realistic there, Mr. Spielberg. On top of that, the ordeal of fearing for their sons life brings the divorced parents back together (cheese. Alans ""ward"" is carried away by a murderous tyranodon and is found alive with only a few cuts at the end of the film (super cheese). And to top it off, the marines and half the navy come in just to save the little group right at the end (uber cheese.) The murderous nature that made the velociraptors movie staples in the last two films is pretty has the edge filed down in this film, all in a almost-corny effort to make them seem ""smart."" Like ""Lost World,"" which tried to promote the idea of dinosaurs being caring parents at the films expense, this film tries to push the idea that raptors were geniuses in dinosaur terms (they weren't, by the way. Most raptors weren't much smarter than a wolf.) The end result is just an unfair robbing of what made the raptors scary in the first place. That cold, merciless nature of theirs.JPIII is a competent film, and you can see there were a few good ideas thrown in, but in the end, without any inspiration from one of Crichton's actual novels, the story falls flat. It's nice to see some flying Dino's and the Spinosaur is a competent ""villain"" (though not nearly as scary as Rex,) but other than that, I really wouldn't recommend this film as a must see. If your a major dinosaur fan, go ahead. For anyone else, rent, don't buy.",Jurassic Park III
500,pmicocci,Dumber by installment,1,16 August 2004,"If the first of this seemingly interminable series was rather far-fetched, at least it didn't push to the extremes of absurdity (well, maybe not more than a few times); Jurassic Park III does practically from the start. Dinosaurs and pterosaurs are constantly depicted exhibiting traits that might be believable in primates, dog packs or even domesticated animals but would be ridiculous to attribute to reptiles; the writers go so far as to mention the ""alpha male"" of a pack of large herbivores - I guess that makes it sound more ""authentic""... Even in the original movie such behavior strained credibility past the breaking point on a few occasions, such as having a dinosaur burst through solid walls as if it recognized what a wall is and anticipated what would be on the other side - was that a tyrannosaurus or Godzilla? How many wild animals has anyone ever seen demonstrate such behavior? With each movie the 'raptors become more and more fiendishly clever; by the time V or VI rolls out (probably on direct-to-video), you might almost expect to hear one of them say, ""I am your father!""",Jurassic Park III

I can remember back to my younger years as a student when I played this dinosaur game on the computer. It pretty much showed you every dinosaur there ever was. It had real videotaped footage of the dino's in action. There was an Allosaurus chase among many others. In this movie there are more dinosaurs than some people had thought before. They dinosaurs eat a few people and some dinosaurs are nicer than other dinosaurs. The real thriller here is that Sam Neil somehow has a black daughter. By black I mean African-American and not like Gothic. I could understand if he had a Gothic daughter. Always telling her he's going to ""study dinosaurs."" I'd be Gothic too if my parent told me he was studying ""live dinosaurs."" Anyway she is black through some way or the other and he is not black; however, he occasionally has black in his wardrobe. A focal point of this movie is that they kidnap a baby t-rex and in maniacal crazy killer t-rex fashion they try to eat the people that took the baby. The baby soon learns to speak English and translates to the parents who are still not impressed with the whole situation. The black daughter is also a gymnast and manages to woo the t-rex's with back flips and toe touches. Harelik plays a nice role as someone I can't remember.

There are new accents: the raptors are not shown as monsters but as intelligent beings, and in general, the animals appear more like real animals rather than dinosaurs. There are even quiet moments with a Tyrannosaurus. What you get, is a short, compact film with elements from horror and nature documentary.

Why does Costa Rica monitor the air-restricted space over Isla Sorna? And just how did Eric collect that dino-urine?Now, if this were the first Jurassic Park movie seen by the public, the audience would have been ecstatic!  The special effects are top-notch, and the sound is superb.  But this movie has to deliver the goods since the first movie was an absolute theatrical triumph.  The goods were almost delivered.  But left you thirsty for more.  There were too many events I was waiting for that didn't take place.  I thought for sure the dino-urine was going to be used as a survival tactic.  And having us believe a young boy could survive for 8 weeks sent my eyes rolling just like the female gymnast kicking the dinosaur in the head in JP2.  And why didn't Eric's stepfather cut himself down from the tree?  And wouldn't you think that if a little boy lost his beloved step-father, you'd think he would have been a little emotional over his loss.  But there's no reference to him at all.But the movie was impaling from the opening scene.  And your eyes never leave the screen, as you feel engrossed in the spectacular feel of realism. The use of the cell phone was creative and very clever.  And you'll find yourself constantly looking behind the characters just in case they missed a dinosaur following them.  There's a sense of urgency throughout the movie. I, too, wanted off the island.  And then, when that moment finally arrived, I was disappointed.  I wanted to stay and try to survive a little longer. And that's the only downfall of this movie.  A military attack on the dinosaurs would have been interesting... Prehistoric monsters versus modern-day machinery!

Sure, they have to get on the island (once again) and sure they have to find some way out-that incredulous stuff aside, the thing that bugged me was that none of the stuff in between was very interesting either.  For one, you never got the impression that they were on a real island.  Drawn out moments of aimless dialogue were punctuated by noisy chase sequences which just came on arbitrarily simply on account of there being enough time elapsed since the last one.  Even with the chase sequences, they seemed to be done (even fictionally) 'in the lab' because as our human characters are being chased through the forest, very little wildlife is seen to scamper about-the cast quite conveniently (from an animators' point of view) only encounter one monster at a time.

You wouldn't think the 3rd movie would improve on the realistic look of the dinosaurs, but overall, they just didn't mix in well with the live action. The plastic looking flesh is accompanied by an overuse of colors. They simply don't look like reptiles.The movie did have it's moments. The short, but massive fight between the short lived T-Rex and the new reptile in town was an awesome scene. Sam Neil saved the acting department and it was good to see him reprise his role as the palentoligist.I think screen writers are running out of ideas, as Jurassic Park 3's storyline is certainly lacking.

509,dukestwinpack,Worth the price of admission,10,11 December 2001,"After reading Michael Sibley's review (21 Nov 2001), I just had to comment on the film.After being disappointed with Pearl Harbor, Planet of the Apes and the rest of the summer fare, I was hoping JP3 would save my summer. It did.This movie series has never really been about the actors-just the dinosaurs - and the third installment brings a darker, edgier, Aliens-style moodiness to it. There's the ridiculous excuse to get Dr. Grant (Sam Neill) back on the island and immediately we're rewarded with the site of dinosaurs running amouk and eating hapless humans.Whereas Sibley gushes ""Leoni continues to charm audiences with her presence and beauty"" all I've got to say is that she did OK. Not great and not horrible. Ditto with William H. Macy, Sam Neill and the rest. Like I said, it doesn't matter if they can't act well. They just need to know how to scream and run on cue.If you really liked JP1 and were a bit disappointed in the blahness of JP2, you'll enjoy JP3. I recommend.",Jurassic Park III
510,wedaniel-2,A Great Sequel to add to the Trilogy,10,12 January 2002,I recently watched this film on DVD.  I did not see it in the theatre but the film was a lot of fun.  It's very hard to make sequels to great hits. Those voting seem to not appreciate the time and effort that goes into film making.  Especially ones with so many special effects.  I think Spielberg captured the adventure/suspense of the other Jurassic Parks as well as adding new elements.If you like action and adventure then this film is a must.,Jurassic Park III
511,c007ty,GREAT FILM!,10,11 August 2001,"Let me say that this is a film that you either like, or dislike. The thing is I think most people like it. There might be more negative reviews, but even some of the critics are liking it! Some people are having problems with it's story, it's acting, it's character development, even it's CGI!STORY: What else could you have done for it. What clever idea can you do to get dinosaurs chasing and eating people. Well there isn't. So I really wouldn't dis the story line. I thought it was better, by far! Better than TLW's! ACTING: We were introduced to really good actors. Sam Neill, who is certainly my fav. actor, is excellent in this film. He makes everything around him seem very believable! William H. Macy, a great actor who is really known from his great film ""Fargo"", plays his character very well. Tea Leoni, she really hot in ""Family Man"", plays her charater well, but has an anoying scream. But, please, is that what why we say the movie is bad? Trevor Morgon, yes he's a kid, he did well and found himself not anoying like TLW's ""KELLY"". Not high wire gymnastic stunts! Alessandro Nivola, this guy plays in ""Face Off"" which I really don't remember seeing him in, does a great job! He made me care about his character. Micheal Jeter, Del in ""Green Miles; always liked him, does good too. Funniest lines are from him!CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT: Ok, everybody on here seems to have a problem with it, when there really isn't. Every scene had character development up till the moment of the spinosaur. All of them had motives, and that was good. Maybe I really didn't quite get to know NASH or COOPER well enough, but they made great snack food for SPINY!CGI: I hoped no one had a problem with it, cause I sure didn't! None of the dinosaurs seemed fake. Unlike in TLW, REX had some fake problems with his feet! Watch it and pause and see for your self! The rex vs. spino battle was something no ther movie ever had in history. Making it look real I mean!A problem that one of the commenters had was this: ""Not only did Grant's wife know that they were at Isla Sorna, but sent all these troops to rescue them."" Clearly he did not listen or watch anything that was said or seen in the movie. Ellie is not Grant's wife, and she is not his girlfriend. Her husband works for International relations, so he has connections! And Grant clearly said to her on the phone, ""SITE B"", which is Isla Sorna! Other problems people are talking about is the action. How can the action suck? It was has more than any other movie. Mindless action? What's mindless about it? Basically this meets the first Jurassic Park's level or surpasses it. That was one thing ""Jurassic Park"" had missing, was not enough action. And the series was really not meant to be a Masterpiece only a thrill ride and awing movie! Nothing more, and nothing less. And I guess TLW missed something too. It missed freshness, which is what JP3 gave. TLW was just a rehash. So I give JP3 10/10!",Jurassic Park III
512,c007ty,You know you enjoyed it!,10,20 December 2001,"One of the best movies of the year. Forget Harry Potter and rent this movie that'll make you sit on the edge of your seat. A breathless roller coaster popcorn ride.Forget all bad comments. And to the people who diss the movie so much. I guess there is nothing to please you all. For goodness sakes it was better than The Lost World. The only reason you like to put TLW:JP above JP3 simply because it was directed by Spielberg. Yes Spielberg can direct good movies, but he not perfect. He failed at The Lost World and your just gonna have to admit it.JP3 is everything The Lost World should have been. Acting is what it should be.As I heard from one of the commenters ""we don't want purple t-rexes around here"". First of all there weren't any purple Rexes. Not even close to the color purple. Which makes me wonder if you even saw the movie. Next I heard someone say the effects wasn't as good as the first. The effects have improved dramatically from the first looking even more real than ever. If you noticed that the dinosaurs actually had their muscles jiggle when ever they were supposed to under the skin like real animals. The skin was made with more detail and they basically up the anty a lot bigger than ever.Don't listen to me, don't listen to the people who hate this movie. Just go and see for yourself and make your own opinion.",Jurassic Park III
513,rmssw,Summer action at its best...,8,20 July 2001,"Jurassic Park was great.  The Lost World was mediocre.  Jurassic Park III is a surprisingly enjoyable blend of its two predecessors.  It combines everything that made the first film great with everything that made the second film stupidly entertaining.  You get amazing atmosphere and subtle, eerie effects, while at the same time, being blown away by very blunt and in-your-face shock-horror.  They mix to make for a very suspensful and scary summer thrill ride.I think the best thing about it is the variety is offers.  Unlike The Lost World, whose action was practically identical to the original film, it offers new and exciting hazards for the cast to overcome.  In the first two films, there were only two main threats, the Tyrannasaurus Rex and the Velociraptors.  However, in JP3, the T-Rex is almost completely absent (he makes a pleasing cameo early in the movie), and a great twist is added to the Raptors.  Also, two new dinosaurs are thrown into the characters' faces, the Spinosaurus (who even the T-Rex fears) and the Pteradon, a flying dinosaur.However, like all films, JP3 has its flaws.  These flaws include an almost entirely unbelievable ending, which in my opinion, came too soon, the movie ended before things had a chance to wrap up.  It probably won't win the Oscar for best picture, but when you get down to it, good acting, great special effects, a pretty good script, and amazing action make this one of the best summer popcorn movies in years.",Jurassic Park III
514,sinkerhawk,It Really Is Not Just a Walk in the Park!!!,10,18 July 2001,"I must first say that I went to this movie with anticipation, but also was a bit of restraint.  I had heard from early reviews that the story line was simplistic and too far fetched to amount to anything.  What I got from the movie blew me away!  The script is simple, but hardly without plot twists and surprises.  The action is crisp and clear with hardly any of those momemts when the camera is so close to the action you can't tell what's happening.  It's as if they took the best elements from the first two films and just layered them on in this one.  After a few minutes I totally forgot about trying to see which dinosaurs were real and which were CGI and just lost myself.The acting was excellent, including Sam Neill's reprisal of Dr. Alan Grant. He added the familiar link that was needed to really bring you back to the first storyline.  Trevor Morgan, the young actor who plays Eric Kerby, really shines in his role.  Michael Jeter and William H. Macy are good in every role they play, no surprise there.  Kudos to the entire cast and crew. Great work!At one and a half hours, they concluded the film perfectly and left me wanting more, but very satisfied.  If you liked the first movie and the second, you will squeal like a raptor for this third installment.  Don't walk, RUN to this movie.If Gone With the Wind is your favorite movie, rent the Whales of August sit down in a comfy rocking chair, and get a nice, small glass of tea to sip. Jurassic Park III is not your...ahm...cup of tea.",Jurassic Park III
515,mrtobrien,Rented this recently,2,14 June 2002,"And I want a refund.  The first one was good, the second was not, this one I don't know what I was expecting, but it wasn't much.  And that's exactly what I got.  Gee... the kid was still alive after 2 months alone on an island filled with giant predators.  Gee... his stepdad was dead 10 minutes after they landed there.  I don't know why they continue to insist on the raptors as a focal point for the movie, or why they continue to make them 4 times as big as they should be(large dog size ~50-60 pounds).  Now they've even made them smart, to the point of full fledged emotion.  Though, if they were really that smart, they simply would have slaughtered the people the first time they saw them, and gotten their eggs back.  I also don't get how all these people can consistently outrun things that are going 30-40 mph. over uneven ground.  Don't waste your money on this, it's not good, and it's not bad enough that you can laugh at it enough for it to be good.",Jurassic Park III
516,fcurry,"IGNORE NEGATIVE REVIEWS, THIS IS PRETTY GOOD!",8,10 August 2001,"Unlike Planet of the Apes (2001), JP3 is actually not bad compared to other Spielberg tri-parts like Jaws III, Poltergeist III, and Last Crusade. This film is somewhat a menagerie of One Million Years BC, those Godzilla movies of the 70s, and those 'hidden prehistoric island' comics but the material is still fresh unlike the extra characters' current state. Sam Neil is excellent as his performance as Grant (again) and the dinosaurs as majestic as in the first. Lost World was more of 'Jurassic Park as Carnosaur 4' with little to emphasize on the dinosaurs (particularly the raptors that merely popped up in long grass and eat baddies, why Spielberg made it I don't know). There were also more 'beauty' scenes in this one (eg Brachiosaurs exiting the lake in the original) which is a bonus. I heavily recommend this to anyone with kids age 10-15. Anything else will either be too cheesy or too scary. My only complaint: not enough Tyrannosaurus screen time.",Jurassic Park III
517,JMan-5,Very disappointing,3,9 January 2002,"Reading like a diary instead of a story, this third movie of man versus maneaters has a lot of interesting events, but no real plot. With it moving as quickly as it does, by the end we are still waiting for something to happen. Sure several unimportant people get eaten in various ways, and we get to see Tea Leoni dig into a pile of dino dung, but nothing original happens and the big beasts are getting a little boring. What could have made this film better? Trashing the idea before any money was spent.*1/2 out of ****",Jurassic Park III
518,the_shadow_guard,Better than The Lost World,10,23 December 2003,"This movie did not try as hard to be good; it went more for some suspense, visuals, and more dinosaurs. It didn't pretend that certain people, such as Tea Leoni's character, were supposed to be geniuses even though they weren't. And it worked. It ended up being better than Jurassic Park 2 in terms of the story and the characters. Not that huge of a plot, mind you, but it gave some things to think about without parading its great ideas too much (for example, the idea of the boy having found surviving on the island somewhat easier than surviving his family problems). If you want to see some suspense, Tea Leoni flipping out, and a flying dinosaur walking on its wings, this is it.",Jurassic Park III
519,marioarp1995,Not JP1 but certainly NOT bad at all,7,29 July 2011,"Jurassic Park 3 has been hugely criticized for being more gore than heart. Does that matter in any sense? The main reason half the people that watch the first movie was for well.... THE DINOSAURS! And hay you get'em in this movie as well, it's just they were depicted a little more monstrous and brain dead than usual. The only part of this movie I didn't like was that they made the Spinosarous the main antagonist and had it killed everyones favorite a very superior dinosaur the T-Rex. Don't get me wrong, I thought the Spinosarous was a great Addition to the franchise but still, I think the T-Rex should of killed the Spinosarous, JUST SAYIN! So yeah this movie is no where near as bad as people say, and if your a die-hard JP fan, like me, you'll enjoy this movie just as much as the others!",Jurassic Park III

I have been overly obsessed with Jurassic Park my entire life and first was a masterpiece that can't be topped, but both sequels are a great excuse to watch things escalate quickly with some great actors and DINOSAURS. This is a high budget movie with great visual effects that brings you into one of the absolute coolest environments that we can only imagine otherwise. It's not perfect, but it sure isn't quite so devastating as many of these Yelp-esque critics would lead you to believe.",Jurassic Park III
521,Samtheshrikker,"A shame, but not a disaster...",6,3 August 2014,"Despite Sam Neill's return as Alan Grant, other members of the cast and the overall structure prevent this third installment from capturing the magic of the first two films.Sam Neill delivers a stellar performance as Alan Grant, rivalling the attention to detail he contributed in the 1993 original. Tea Leoni and William H. Macy pull off a decent job too, although Alessandro Nivola (playing Billy) seems a little out of his depth at times. While Trevor Morgan gives ""Eric"" his all, fans of realism may baulk at how headstrong and unfazed he seems through it all, given his character's age of 12 and his long term stranding on the island. Unlike the first two films, director Joe Johnston adopts a much shorter running time of 93 minutes, bracing viewers for an all action experience. In some ways this works, as there are some truly breathtaking scenes involving the dinosaurs themselves. However, it prevents any sort of character progression, which was a very obvious and well-liked feature of the first two films. Similarly, stalwart fans of the original Jurassic Park won't appreciate Johnston's refusal to incorporate any sort of climax; instead, the action starts early and pretty much stays at the same pace, which may annoy viewers who like to be surprised and teased. That said, the effects involving the dinosaurs remain outstanding, and some of the many action scenes strongly rival the tension found in the first two films. The musical score is still strong, and the script, while nowhere near the strength of its predecessors, still convinces enough to hold its own.Jurassic Park 3 is by no means a BAD film. If you're a dino fan, or just want to see Sam Neill don the famous hat one last time, then go for it. It's just that in making the picture an all-action roller coaster, a lot of the depth found in the originals seems absent, and without that, the subtle touches that made them so magical also vanishes. It's arguably this that prevents Jurassic Park III from being as truly great as its bigger brothers were.",Jurassic Park III
522,ets2000,"Once again, not just a walk through the park, but still fun",8,25 July 2001,"This is not ""Gone With the Wind"", ""Citizen Kane"" nor ""Birth of a Nation""; however, what ""Jurassic Park III"" lacks in story, it more than survives with fun, frightening special effects.  By the second sequel, most series of films have lost either their inventive nature or their ability to remain interesting.  ""J-III"" falls victim to the former following a simple overused plot:  kid gets lost, separated parents join together to find son, they all encounter dangerous situation and bond in a newfound family in their attempt to survive.  Of course, in this film, the dinosaurs provide the catalyst for the danger.  These creatures are fun to watch and give us a delightful fright every few minutes. They are certainly worth the price of admission. Sam Neill, William H. Macy and Tea Leoni give adequate performances as the scientist and parental duo;  although, all three have been much stronger in previous films.  Only Trevor Morgan as the young, lost son excels in an emotional portrayal equal to his role in ""The Patriot"". Bottom line:  if you want a creative and innovative science fiction trilogy, stick with ""Back to the Future"".  However, if you want all the fun and don't care about intellectual storylines to work the brain, ""Jurassic Park III"" will certainly suffice.  Watch it with your pet lizard;  he'll like it too.",Jurassic Park III

524,Antiknown,Entertaining? Yes. Satisfying? Well...Almost.,8,21 July 2001,"Definitely better than The Lost World, this attempt was pretty sharp, although lacking in minor ways. I think if the studios keep the writing good and break into new and different territory each time (like this one did), they can probably guarantee themselves two more successful (and possibly entertaining) movies. The dinosaurs looked excellent as ever, a great variety of different species making an appearance here and there. Wonderful directing by Joe Johnston who captures the suspense and the realism of the dinosaurs flawlessly. William H. Macy and Tea Leoni's characters are also a pleasant addition to this film as well (even if you want to see them munched on for disregarding sound advice). With all those things aside, the plot was pretty simple and acceptable, leaving the dinosaurs plenty of screen time.I felt the film maintained a comparative realism throughout also. Although, for such a hostile environment, the characters that should have suffered a grisly fate of the dinosaurs seem to always survive extravagantly. The survival should have been more chaotic and less predictable, with one supporting character living through with a story to tell, or maybe even no one surviving the uneventful jaunt to the island. That's my only gripe against the film.Expect no surprises like that though, just your standard summer thrill ride (within it's limitations). I'm sure the studios wouldnt want to plaster an apocalyptic ending on a big Summer Blockbuster anyways, or gore their big named Hollywood stars halfway through the film. They did their job though and got me to pay the admission and enjoy most of the ride. Its worth seeing, at least the first time around. I give it an 8 out of 10.",Jurassic Park III
525,Andrew Devonshire,Pass the oxygen cylinder I need air.,7,19 July 2001,"I just got back from seeing this movie ten minutes ago and I'm still needing to catch my breathe.  This film is almost non-stop action from start to finish.Having seen the last two films this one is able to hold its head tall amongst them.  I liked the first one, but at times found it too talky and more character based, using action only at short intervals.  The second film on the other hand didn't even stop for biscuits.  It was two hours of action.The third film I liked because it was more like the third film in that respect.  It moved from one edge of the seat scene to the next, but also balanced with enough time to get to know and like the characters, the second film's biggest failing.This film, unlike the last two, also scared the Cornflakes out of me (I'm glad I don't get enough fibre or the theatre would have smelt like left overs at a bull fight).  The fast pace made any dinosaur appearance a popcorn spilling scare, and the will they/won't they escape scenario made the entire thing all the more tense.Bottom Line - If you want a heart warming oscar winning drama (apart from get a life) look elsewhere, but if you want an all out action flick that won't let up for a second this is your movie and role on part four. 8/10",Jurassic Park III

The films main two flaws are that its far more cheesy than the other two and that theres hardly any suspense. New dinosaurs just suddenly appear with no celebration or anything. Its an all out running film, which is probably why the film is so short. Only about 90 minutes. The story is pretty much the same as The Lost World, with a team being assembled to go to Site B to rescue someone, but ending up being chased by all sorts of dino's, on land, sea and air. On a positive note, Sam Neill returns as Dr.Grant, which helps move on the trilogy. The effects are brilliant, much better than The Lost World (which I thought were actually worse than JP's),and you can really see where all the moneys gone. But all the special effects in the world can't really make up for the cheesy and un-original script, average directing and a predictable plot. The climax is also a huge let down.

It's a real shame that such little effort was put into a film which could have been great, and could have appealed to people from every walk of life.As a screenwriter, I understand that what most people are in the market for come summer is a mindless, popcorn-munching flick to simply take them away from life's monotony.  That's fine and it's something that writers should be cognizant of...

531,Numero Uno,Please no more...no more!,6,1 October 2001,"Dear, dear me.  What does Spielberg think he is doing?  First this then AI. Jurassic Park 3 is no where as good as the original and it is even worse then number 2.  The plot is weak as anything, despite the fact that the Jurassic Parks are not exactly well known for their riveting plots. However there are several unrealistic points disregarding the fact that the entire movie is about really angry dinosaurs trying to kill some really stupid people.  Along with this are some irritating bits.First of all Sam Neill's character at first seems hell bent, dead set straight about not returning to the dinosaur island then changes his mind in a couple of ticks after a pair of complete strangers claiming to be multi-millionaires offer him a blank cheque.  Oh no, it's not as if you are going to dis-trust a couple of weirdos offering you a hundred million bucks. Like this guy has a moustache and that girl is hot so I can trust them.When the group predictably and inevitably land on the island Tea Leoni goes screaming her head off for her son like a headless chicken despite Neill's fruitless attempts at shutting her gob.  Don't worry its okay I think the man-eating dinosaurs will love my screaming voice.  The fact that the audience wanted to bash the supporting actress's head in right from the start did not help.Then come the dinosaurs.  Why the hell are they so angry?!  The dinosaurs are seriously pumped up about something or other.  They are incredibly mean and aggressive.  Okay I understand, these are scary dinosaurs but they are just too aggressive to the point of fakeness - if that's even a word.Now comes the creme de la creme.  This ten year old kid or whatever he is manages to stay alive for some 2 months on this island while two commando ex US marines armed with grenade launchers and SAS assualt rifles are picked off within 10 minutes of arriving on the island.  This kid jumps out of no where like jungle boy and saves Neill's life with some tear gas.  Like tear gas is not dangerous or anything it just temporarily vapourises your retina. Sure a 10 year old could use that.  I m sure his muscular 10 year old baby arms were good at battling the 500,000 tonne spinosaurus with attitude. These dinosaurs really had attitude!  Can you believe it - attitude!? This part just made me laugh and the rest of the movie was farcical I just could not take it seriously.  The movie lost the atmosphere, it lost its fear factor, it was no longer a movie just a heap of special effects.The film is fairly short too.  It just came and went.  I think it just took a couple of months to shoot using old dino models and the rest was done in front of a computer screen.I watched this in the cinema and the nincompoop of an attendant forgot to turn on the surround sound, which did not help either.  I struggled to hear what the characters were saying...this in a so-called state of the art cinnemax theatre.  Oh the humanity!

532,DarrylEvans2,A masterpiece of imagination!,10,11 December 2001,"(Warning of spoilers in this review)Jurassic Park /// is a thrill ride with never a dull moment. It is jam-packed full of incredible special effects, great actors, imagination, humor, suspense - everything you could possibly ask for in a movie!The film did indeed have a plot ( which many people said there wasn't). There was a beginning, middle and an end. Jurassic Park /// portrayed how a group of people REALLY would survive on the island. We had heard all the science in the first two movies. Now is was on to the action.First of all, the dinosaurs. Industrial Light & Magic did a phenomenal job on the special effects. The scene where a Pteranodon grabs Billy in the water was simply perfect, just like the rest of the movie. It was nice to see the dinosaurs reacting more with their environment this time around. E.g. moving bushes, eating grass, splashing water. Stan Winston also excelled himself. The mixture of CGI and live action was nothing short of perfect. It was nice to see the dinosaurs portrayed as animals rather than pure killing machines like in The Lost World. The Spinosaurus was a nice change from the T-Rex. After all. T-Rex had been the main star of every dinosaur movie since movies began. Not very 21st Century is it?The actors. Sam Neill really made his presence felt in this movie. He was his same old loving self from the first Jurassic Park. That was needed in this movie. Tea Leoni did a fine job acting Amanda - a much better improvement than Julianne Moore (Sarah Harding in The Lost World) who did not stop talking throughout the entire movie. The way Tea acted when coming face-to-face with a Velociraptor was spine-tingling. She was so scared. William H. Macy also acted his role well, as did Alessandro Nivola and Trevor Morgan. Laura Dern also made a very nice appearance.
The script. Even though it was written as they filmed the movie, the script proved to be a success and had many memorable quotes. Alan's speech about Astronomers & Astronauts was by far the best piece of writing I have seen in a film in a long time.The ending was short but nevertheless good. The Pteranodons flying in the clouds was a perfect way to end a perfect movie. At last we saw something believable, unlike the San Diego scene in The Lost World. The main Jurassic Park theme was enchanting and enough to bring a tear to the eye. The original feeling of the original Jurassic Park came flowing back. Joe Johnson captured the Jurassic mood with his brilliant directing as did Don Davis with the score.As a conclusion, this movie does not deserve the bad comments it gets.  It is a true Jurassic Park.

All the earlier films in these franchises were genuine classics.POSSIBLE SPOILERS The original Jurassic Park was a stunning, groundbreaking feat in film-making by the legend that is Steven Spielberg.

It has to be with Spinosaurus. Spinosaurus! What is that all about? It eats a mobile phone and kills the star of the first two, the T-Rex. Rapters having a conversation with each other! What will they do in the 4th? Strut around with mobiles and pagers, and give each other a call when they spot potential prey! Spino already has one.The pterodactils (the ones with the wings for non-specialists) section was a worthy addition and should have been given more attention before this when these films had an ounce of respect.Oh just a couple more things. If a dinosaur has swallowed a phone it would digest in its stomach. You would not hear it ringing from inside a dinosaur's belly. Why don't the rapters just eat them at the end, after they successfully negotiate the return of their eggs? They just leave them to escape with the navy who, without being noticed,  magically turn up in boats and helicopters on the other side of a few trees .As you have probably grasped by now this film frustrated me somewhat and is just as frustrating now as it was when it came out. Shambolic.",Jurassic Park III
534,tfantina,Not as good as the first two,5,30 September 2004,"I enjoyed this film enough to buy a copy of the DVD, but I did not find it as enjoyable as the first two. I think Spielberg should have directed it instead of Joe Johnston, I'm not saying that Johnston is not a good director I am just saying that when a series is directed by the same person it is usually better than when there are two or more directors.PLOT (some spoilers!) A divorced couple (William H. Macy Te¢a Leoni), trick Dr. Allan Grant (Sam Neal) into helping them look for their son, who was lost on the island in a parasailing accident. There plane crashes and it gets worse from there.Not as good as the first Two 7/10",Jurassic Park III
535,kazekiw,Not good but also not as long as the Lost World,5,17 June 2015,"I am easily torn on which movie I don't like more, The Lost World or this one. This movie isn't anything special it just hits the points it needs to, to be a Jurassic Park film. It isn't good but at the same time I feel like the film makers knew it was just a cash in for marketing and toys and stuff like that so they really didn't try as to make it big and long like the last movie prior. It is about Alan Grant from the first film who goes to Site B with some people to find their lost son who accidentally landed on the island. The acting is pretty annoying from Tea Leoni and William H Macy. The only character I actually somewhat like is Sam Neil's ""Alan Grant"" just because I liked him so much from the original. Thank goodness there wasn't Ian Malcolm again or I would've ran away screaming.So still I am torn on which one I dislike more so I'll leave it up to you. Both are bad and have annoying stupid characters. I guess a couple of the chase scenes are entertaining but each of them kind of has an element of stupidity, however sometimes that makes it more fun to watch. It's not terrible but overall not good",Jurassic Park III

Terribly written, badly acted (Tea Leoni had one line: ""ERIC!"" -- and I learned to hate Laura Dern's work in JP1), and absolutely unengaging on any level. The visual effects were a minor redemption, but don't float this sinking rock of a film. There are two scenes in the film that make me think this film was written for young boys:  the fight between a T-Rex and the ""superpredator"" called ""Spineosaurus"" -- and the appearance, and sudden disappearance or ""compys"" that did nothing but hop around for a second before the scene ended.

537,Jeremy Farrance,"Possible To Not Like, But Hard Not To Enjoy!",6,16 June 2002,"I don't understand why they made this movie with such a week script and story. I find it hard to believe that this looked good on paper as a whole. But that is too harsh of course, this really is an enjoyable movie. The movie is made up of a string of really great scenes, most are as good a ride as the best of the first two movies. But it was frustrating to see them so uninventively strung together.I knew going in that Spielberg didn't direct. I also knew that the music was not by John Williams. But I adjusted my expectations for that and so should you if you feel you have a sense for such things. I also managed to watch Jurassic Park and The Lost World the day before seeing JP3. All that did was make the difference in the music stand out (to me).I would not mind another installment in this franchise, but I hope they wait for a really good story before doing so. Lethal Weapon 4 was a great example of a good 4th installment after a bad 3rd movie. Though it doesn't need to be Spielberg, the director of JP4 needs to be a good actor's director; someone capable of really bringing the characters out of the actors (e.g. Bryan Singer or Stephen Frears).I read a few other reviews before seeing JP3 and I can't help agreeing that this movie was a great ride, but only a 'good' movie.",Jurassic Park III
538,jono19,Hollywood Filth,1,27 July 2001,"It's hard to find a good movie these days. I mean a really good movie; one you can leave the theater thinking your money was well spent.  I haven't felt that way in a long long time.  Hollywood lately is simply spewing out movies as fast as possible.  Plots, who cares, as long as it makes them money.  They're going for quantity and not quality.  After watching the movie Jurassic Park 3 (all 1 hour and 20 minutes of it), I was extremely mad.  80 minutes!!!! I didn't know that was even possible. I mean we know the dinos are fake by now, so how can it be scary.  I know add Tea Leoni screaming and running around like her head is cut off for half the movie. What were these people thinking oh yeah the $$.  That's all Hollywood cares about anymore.  All these sequels that we don't need, Pitch Black 2, Batman 4, The Mummy Returns, James Bond where Pierce Brosnan sleeps with every woman he comes into contact with.  It's disgusting what the world is coming to.  I admit there are good movies out there, but they're sparse.  I don't understand how critics could give movies that are clearly garbage, good ratings.  I mean if a movie is done by Spielberg, or Lucas, it automatically adds an extra couple of points to the score. Believe me that if John Carpenter had done A.I. it would have been seen as one of the biggest rip offs.  Pinocchio, the movie D.A.R.Y.L., this was practically the same story with somewhat of a twist and lots of special effects.  Which brings me to another point. It seems that moviemakers are so caught up in the ""effects"" of movies they'll use them to an extent, which is extremely overdone. If anyone has seen the preview for Spiderman yet, you'll know, the man looks like a shiny piece of metal.  This may be pushing it but the dino's in JP3 looked too real, I mean the spikes on top of their heads were metallic and almost multicolored.  Now I know not everybody agrees with me, but I also know that there are a lot of people who do.  Frankly we are fed up with going to the movies and seeing crap, and we're not going to take it anymore",Jurassic Park III
539,Comm Major,"Once again, a letdown....",5,8 August 2001,"It truly crushed me once the end credits rolled at Jurassic Park III's conclusion.  I was almost befuddled as to what my eyes had just witnessed. Were the dinosaurs good?  Yes, of course, it's expected nowadays in film, but after Star Wars: Episode I TPM, I refused to agree with the rest of the population is thinking: modern film relies and most times consists solely of big time CGI, special FX, and what-not.  I refused to conform to society's view on the modern film-- action/adventure film that is.  But, damn, when the credits rolled, I looked to my wife, her cousin, and her husband and we all kind of said in unison, ""What was that?""  Pathetic.  I've never gone to the movies and left the theater with a feeling of confusion, like an everyday sucker.  I feel like my wallet was stolen and had just received news that my two dogs had died.  What the hell is that!?  You don't feel that way after a film.  That spinosaur"" or whatever it's called was great, mean, nasty actually, and ruthless... a true villian.  Allen Grant, what's his name? Sam Neill, right?  He's great, too... except for the end.... Jesus, how cheezy can you be!  Of course I won't ruin it for those who have not witnessed the 2 hour and some minute MASSACRE, but ... my goodness, you can make a film like that, but by all means, please wipe it up with toilet paper and let it sail down the toilet.  Jurassic Park III is pathetic. SFX? Great, but who cares, people want to see a plot, feel for the characters, and enjoy the adventure along the way.   Don't go see it, you'll hate yourself afterwards.PS  I gave it a 5.  Jeez, I don't know why, maybe just for the dinosaurs. Gosh, how pathetic....",Jurassic Park III

Me and my cousins made fun of it from beginning to end.I though it should've been longer.Both scenes where Sam Neill escapes (or gets rescued from Tarzan) from the raptors were incredibly stupid. I think the flaw of this movie was that the makers made the raptors a little too smart.But other than that it was worth cheap night.,Jurassic Park III
541,wtomrice,Give us some credit!!,5,19 July 2001,"Without the wonderful special effects of this film, I would have rated it a 2!  A silly plot with annoying people, I was almost hoping more of the cast would become dinosaur fodder, so that less time would be spent on badly written dialogue and more time would be spent on dinosaurs!The ending leaves much to be desired, and many parts of the movie treat the audience as having very little intelligence.  The ending was way too ""neat"", and it seemed as if the movie had run out of funds, and had to make an abrupt ending in order to stay on budget.  As much as I loved the original Jurassic Park (JP III makes many references to this movie), I didn't connect with any characters in this movie save Dr. Grant.  Sam Neill was good in JP III, but he was unfortunately the only human bright spot.

JP3 lacked character development, lacked a number of characters (to die), and lacked special effects.  The panoramic scenes that had dinosaurs were out of focus, without detail.  We never saw a good closeup.  I came here to see dinosaurs!  JP1 and JP2 had much better CG footage.  On the brighter side, there were several scenes with chuckles.

543,Sandro-LN,As good as the original,8,3 February 2002,"Although many sequels fall short of excitement of the movies that spawned them, Jurassic Park III is as thrilling as the original.At first glance the Kirbys (Téa Leoni and William Macy) seem to play the requisite Stupid Couple whose adventurous spirit is responsible for the plight of the entire plane, which is stranded on Isla Sorna - the second dinosaur island.  It turns out that they are really no longer married, but desperate to find their son Eric and the man he was with, Ben Hildebrand, Mrs. Kirby's new love interest.  In the opening scene Ben and Eric are taking an illegal parasailing tour of the island, when the pilots of the boat disappear in the fog.  Ben and Eric, of course, get stranded on the island and require rescuing.JP3 brings back some of the cast from the original movie, and I was glad to see returning performances from Sam Neill (Alan Grant) and Laura Dern, (Ellie Degler) although ""Ellie's"" role is little more than a bit part.  The sardonically humorous Jeff Goldblum (as Ian Malcolm) is missing, as is Richard Attenborough (as the park's conceptionist John Hammond) but they were included in JP2.These performances combine to tell the tale of a family and its guides who must constantly evade a large, unexpected predator as well as a persistent pack of raptors which seem unusually bent on catching the party.  The third group of dinosaur enemies comes from the air, as for the first time the reptiles take wing in Jurassic Park.Overall this isn't a film that I'd expect to sweep the Oscars, but it is worth viewing a few times.  I rated it 8 of 10.",Jurassic Park III

545,Onlyindreams17,You know they gave up on this one...,3,4 October 2001,"I was appalled by the lack of effort on the part of the filmmakers to at least challenge themselves a bit. Instead, what you get with Jurassic Park 3 is a pointless trick played on the unsuspecting movie goers (even though you should have seen it coming) by the greedy executives who wanted to milk the last drops of the Jurassic Park franchise. First of all, it's not even a Spielberg film anymore (he had the right idea not to get involved creatively), which would explain the lack of good imagery and a sense of adventure, as was apparent in the original Jurassic Park and even upheld quite a bit in The Lost World. But here we just get a pathetic hour and a half of senseless action with very little imagery. You would think that the advances in digital technology could make the visual effects better, but they somehow look less believable than the original, which suggests that very little attention was paid to the quality of the movie.And then there was the plot, or the lack of one. We all know that Jurassic Park is a big title for modern audiences, but there is a lot more to a movie than just selling the name. It almost seems as though the movie was bad on purpose, just because the producers knew that they could get away with it and still make money. That is how sad the film industry has become. Don't you as an audience member want something more than just a quick put together of random effects? Don't you want to be really entertained instead of just being fooled into it? I mean, why did it take three writers to write this story? What did they do, take turns writing a half hour each?Even the blockbuster films from just a few years before seem like quality movies now when compared to today's garbage. Movies like the original Jurassic Park and Independence Day can at least be remembered as difinitive blockbusters. But what we've had recently with Jurassic Park 3 and The Mummy Returns is just annoying garbage that no one will even remember by the end of this year.Then there are those who would argue that this is suppose to be a ""popcorn summer blockbuster"" and can stand behind the excuse of not having to be an actual quality movie. But let me tell you, in its respective genre, a summer blockbuster can still be a good summer blockbuster or a bad summer blockbuster. Just because it will undoubtedly make money doesn't mean that it can't be good. Wouldn't you rather have a good-entertaining movie as a opposed to a forgettable-entertaining movie? Or else we're all going to look back on this someday and say, ""Damn, I can't remember any movies that I liked that year."" Because even if you liked Jurassic Park 3 now (which means that you are in dire need of a good film), I guarantee that you would choose not to sit through it again years from now.My solution to this headache, or my suggestion to those who disagree with me, is to go back and watch the original Jurassic Park. That is what a real action-adventure blockbuster should be. Made by a director with the capabilities of capturing daring images that will enhance the viewing experience, instead of assuming that the half-ass digital effects will do the job. Or better yet, see something like Star Wars or Indiana Jones again, and then you'll realize what an actual disgrace Jurassic Park 3 is to the blockbuster genre. Probably the only thing worse than this movie is knowing that it is part of a franchise that was once respectable and cool. But as far as I'm concerned, I will never consider Jurassic Park 3 as part of my Jurassic Park collection.",Jurassic Park III

The aim I guess that the people behind the scenes were aiming for was a family movie with a bit of suspends and while there is a family movie to be had here, it also tries to be a Jurassic Park film and unfortunately it fails as both to a degree.It fails as a family movie cause the script is not strong enough to support the story. Despite the venom thrown at William H Macy and especially Tea Leoni, both are very appealing actors and they do work hard to make it all work but the script just handicap their efforts to make it possible. It fails as a Jurassic Park film cause it lacks the tension, suspense and the story points that made the first two films in the series ( Jurassic Park And The Lost World) so well made and memorable. Not to mention the fact that they felt like fully formed movies with a beginning, middle and end. Jurassic Park 3 just feels like a Saturday morning serial. Not bad but nothing like the other films in the series. There is one scene in the film that almost manages to bring a little tension which is the bird cage scene but even that ends up flat compared to any of the scenes in the other films of the series. The other major problem is the fact that While Sam Neill works his ass off to make this film watchable, the script does the most disservice to the character of Alan Grant, whose happy ending from the original Jurassic Park was not only ruined thanks to this movie but has his character dumb down in order to fall for the dumb stuff that happens in this film.

Unfortunately, it didn't try to do much of anything else, leaving us with yet another big, dumb, summer action flick... hardly the caliber of the previous films.Basically, the story goes like this: a rich kid is taken to Costa Rica by his parents to do some para-sailing... and, for some reason, he decides that an island famed for its man-eating dinosaurs would be the best place to do it. Surprise, surprise: Something Goes Wrong, and the kid is stranded on the island. Who do his parents go to for help? Dr. Grant, the paleontologist who happened to get himself involved with dinosaurs before. Rather than telling him the truth upfront, they con him into coming by giving him a big fake check and swearing that they will not touch down on the island. Dr. Grant agrees hesitantly to this condition. But when they get to the island, they touch down anyway, making their plane a prime target for a dinosaur attack. Something Goes Wrong again, and this time, Grant and the kid's parents are stuck as well.The plot pretty much ends right there, and that's only the first thirty minutes of the movie. The rest of the movie involves people running from and/or getting eaten by dinosaurs. Like I said, it's a big, dumb, action flick. If you're looking for something that even remotely has an air of the old Michael Crichton magic, look to the first two films.

Obviously they had to find a way of placing some people on one of the dinosaur islands and i think the way this happens is quite good.

The acting is pretty good throughout the whole film and especially Sam Neill and Duchovny wife Tea Leonie come up with a fine performance. Only Mr. Kurby seems to be in the wrong film. I liked his role in Boogie Nights, but since that film i have to laugh every time i see him. I just can´t take him seriously anymore :-)Another thing many people dislike is that the T-Rex isn´t part of the cast anymore. Well that´s not too bad a thing.

And i do think that he was replaced by some dinosaurs who were worth watching as well.There is plenty of action and the movie is defintely not too long.( 1 h 25 min. )But i have to admit that there are facts which separate J.P.III from very good movies. The dialogues are really bad and after the first 30 minutes the characters are basically running away all the time. I think they were running even more than good ol´ arnie and his friends in ""Running Man"" did.The story starts off alright, but isn´t developed during ther movie. And the end is absolutely horrible!!! I had a good laugh at that. Since i compose music myself i was disappointed by the score. Mr. Williams created such a great score for the first movie. Now some other guy is doing a ""remix"" of it. you do get to hear the theme from time to time, but it is always a bit different then the original one. That is a shame.So all in all i give   7/10.",Jurassic Park III
561,kaelnin-1,What the...?,7,18 July 2001,"Let me start off by saying that I am a huge fan of the Jurassic Park series, and I anxiously await the sequel to this movie. That being said, let me give you my views on what may also be the last film in this series.First, let me touch on the plot, or the lack thereof. I would like to know what Joe Johnston and Steven Speilberg were thinking when they made this movie. Obviously it was not ""Let's come up with a shooting script before we start filming"". The pitch must have been something along the line of ""Let's get Sam Neill to reprise his role of Dr. Alan Grant and have HIM go to Isla Sorna. We can come up with the rest as we go."" And its evident. Nothing memorable at all as far as dialog. At least Lost World, which in my eyes was the best of the three movies, had stupid cliched one-liners that were quotable. This film's biggest line is ""Look out!"" They should have used that as the tag line, and saved some people some money.The acting, while bad, was no where near as bad as most cheap b-movies I have seen in the past. Once again, some of the best acting is done by the digital dinosaurs, but I will give credit where credit is due. Sam Neill did a great job with what he had, and the reason for them to be on the island in the first place, Trevor Morgan (who plays the boy, Eric), was much better than any of the previous kids. One of the reason I did not enjoy the first movie was the lousy performance by the children, not that Malcolm's daughter in the second movie was much better. Both mercenaries could have been played by anyone on a street corner, and William H. Macy was entertaining, but I can't stand Tea' Leoni to begin with, and she wasn't very good here.The effects were what you expect from a Jurassic Park movie. With television quickly catching up to what you see in feature films (the recent ""Walking with Dinosaurs"" being an example), they might need to up the ante a bit with the next film, but they did a fine job here. The new big boy on the block, the Spinosaurus, was well animated and effectively creepy, as were the cool pterodons, but my hat's off to the team that worked on the raptors. Superb work, guys. I really, really liked what you did with them by making them individualistic and extremely graceful and fluid in their movements. I hope your successors keep up the good work.Now on to my final point and my biggest complaint about the movie, the ending. So abrupt was the ending that I considered sticking around through the credits just to see if there was more. There is no closure here, and it raises a whole new level of questions. Things were brought up in the film that I expected an explanation for an we never get it. In one scene, it is mentioned that the Spinosaurus was ""not on the list"" of In Gen bred animals and the discussion brought up the question as to what else was on the island that did not make ""the list"". I am still waiting for an answer. And how did the pteredons get out of the ""birdcage""? I understand that Tea' Leoni left the outside door open, but she clearly ran through two seperate set of doors to get out with Trevor Morgan. What the heck?!? And why didn't the smaller carnivore (which I am assuming is a Centaurasaurus(sp?)) not attack them when they bump into it in the movie?Maybe the DVD will answer these questions, and as I stated in the beginning maybe the possible (and likely) sequel will answer some of them. Until then I am left wandering...",Jurassic Park III

564,salnkent,"Proof that less is, indeed, more...",7,27 July 2001,"To be honest, I'm not an overwhelming fan of any of the three Jurassic Park movies.  Don't get me wrong; they're all at least decent movies of their sort, and the effects in all are very good, indeed. Still, if I were to pick one of the three as being the most ""together,"" I'd pick this third installment.  It's around 90 minutes long, and this has two positive (and one negative)effects.  First, I'd classify JP movies as ""adventure,"" rather than horror movies or even sci-fi. As such, good adventure movies benefit from a fast pace.  Let's face it; the plot holes inherent in such a genre are more easily swallowed when the movie comes at you at breakneck speed (case in point; just about ANY Nick Cage action movie!) Second, the movie has less time to get bogged down in romance or 'revealing character features,' and again --- in action movies, this is a good thing. Action movie characters, by their very nature, need to be archetypal (that is: basic.)  Too much characterization is actually a bad thing!  But there is one problem with JPIII that is length-related; the ending is truncated. It's in keeping with the rest of the movie, but it did leave me somewhat dissatisfied. Still, this movie was a fun romp; a great movie to chow down on popcorn and take an emotional roller-coaster ride.  Oh, and while there's plenty of suspense, there's little gore, so if the six- to eight-year-olds can handle the suspense, at least they won't be having nightmares, most likely.  Enjoy!",Jurassic Park III
565,magic_rich,"Brilliant, imaginative sequel..",7,24 September 2001,"When I first heard about this movie, I thought 'what new things can they do this time?'. But I was wrong. They have added whole new scenes including Pterodactyls (at least I think they were). While some parts of the film are a little unrealistic (mainly the ending) it is very good but some classic scenes have been included again from the previous movies. It is definitely better than the 2nd, but not as good as the first one. What I like is that it went back the the general location of the first movie and included some dinosaurs.Very imaginative, but if they make another one, I wish them very good luck, as they will need it to come up with a better ending.",Jurassic Park III

Actually they get chased by really big cgi dinos, and it's real fun to watch.Overall, one big, fun chase 9/10",Jurassic Park III
567,Dyonus,A disgrace to Michael Crichton's work.,5,27 January 2003,"I am a big Crichton fan and I did NOT appreciate this movie. For starters, there was no novel for them to base it off of (even though they wouldn't have followed the novel very well.) Second, the writer obviously knew very little about the subject he wrote about seeing as the paleontologists talk in layman terms throughout the entire film, not giving it the scientific facts that add to its predecesor. Thirdly, and this one isn't all THAT big of deal, but the graphics and robot interaction was terrible. When they changed from one to the other, it wasn't very gradual or subtle. The skin looked way too plastic on the robot. This film should've been made by the original creators, then maybe it would've been better.",Jurassic Park III

569,seppo-sihvo,"Dreadful as hell, unless you're one of those audiences..",4,21 May 2005,"For a common dinosaur fan, JP/// is brilliant entertainment. The sad thing is that to the ones who respect the concept that made JP unique originally can be real badly disappointed with this after TLW's let-down climax. Yes, Jurassic Park is part of the ""monsters eating people"" genre but the very reason it was successful in the beginning is also the reason why it has lost all of it's true content to be replaced by plain ""dinosaurs eating people"". You see, the one thing that ever made this ""concept"" unique was lost right after the first movie. Jurassic Park was about three things in major: 1: Dinosaurs being brought back to life with complex genetic engineering which poses an issue far greater than the mere capability of being able to do so.2: Dinosaurs evading public awareness with their mysteriousness when almost every other monster film of similar shape has made it's creatures well known for people, something The Lost World's ending completely evaporated.3: Characters you can actually be surprised by.So what remains is what we've seen before, dinosaurs posing dynamically in front of cameras and press while dangling screaming victims from their mouths in imitation of King Kong. Why is this? Because the majority of ""fans"" spending cash to the trilogy don't care about anything else in their movie night. They are the common dinosaur fans, not fans of Jurassic Park as a unique concept. So the one single thing that made the first movie a success has ever since drowned and faded away to be replaced by ""cheap canary tricks"" to quote Spielberg himself. The first film was a one-time wonder thanks to it and, now that the fandom of JP's true concept shrunk badly from the 90s, it is clear why this film forgot so much of what the first tried to imply and has condemned itself to be just like any other dinosaur film with no true relevancy whatsoever outside ""I'm bored so I'm watching this"" entertainment. And that eats away the experience of "" being at Jurassic Park above other prehistoric imitations"" like acid. So, for a fan loyal to the concept such as me, this movie is irrelevant at best as it's only true magnetic pulling force lies in the dinosaur effects when the story is obviously a cheap gimmick to make it happen when it could have been more. And that's kinda weak. 4.5/10.",Jurassic Park III
570,callum-mccolgan,"Shallow, but effortlessly entertaining",7,26 January 2018,"This film gets a lot of stick from series fans, perhaps not all of it undeserved - Jurassic Park 3 is largely devoid of meaningful depth, originality and strong storytelling. But despite all that, I can't help but also find it effortlessly entertaining.When I re-watched all the previous films in the run-up to Jurassic World, I was taken aback on how much I enjoyed Jurassic Park 3. It's not exactly deep to be sure, but it's also pacy and packed with entertaining action sequences, never feeling as bloated and stodgy as The Lost World even if it never matches up to the original.And these action scenes are genuinely well-made. Maybe the abundance of chaotic close-ups and shaky cam in modern blockbusters has actually helped JP3 age pretty well - the action is coherently staged, the locations imaginatively utilized and the dinosaurs rendered with the same awesome might as you'd expect from the previous films (despite the dated CG, which could be applied to both of its predecessors).Although there isn't an individual scene here that I feel can match the original's paddock breakout, nor even the second's long grass scene, they're still delivered at a steady pace that ensures there's little feeling of drag during it's short runtime. Even so, the crash and aviary scenes are especially memorable for their taut tension.Much has been said of the weak story, and it's not a completely unfair observation. There's nothing special about the plot: people get dropped on a tropical island for contrived reasons, dinos attack, extras are eaten, then the rest of the film follows a series of progressively bigger set pieces until it ends (though I will say it seems to lack an obligatory finale sequence, which makes sense given one was planned before being cut). There's a fairy forgettable plot thread of a family coming back together, which at least doesn't feel intrusive enough to bloat the runtime as The Lost World's muddled themes were want to do. Despite the redundant storyline, there are some fairy snappy moments of dialogue to be found here and there (""What if they can us with them"" : ""What if they catch us *without* them?""), and the cast turns up a solid set of performances - well, with one exception...Jurassic Park 3 is about as far removed as you can get from the abstract science and bloody grime of Crichton's original novel. It's a big-budget B-movie with no other purpose than to deliver a few solid thrills and then bowl out before overstaying its welcome.In short, it's 90 minutes of solid dino action, nothing more and nothing less, and I still enjoy it immensely for that reason.",Jurassic Park III
571,amullen34,Easily the worst one in the series,1,18 December 2017,"I LOVE Jurassic Park. I love dinosaurs. I loved the cast of these movies. The first movie is my favorite movie of all time. The second one had its good moments, but it was generally below average. The reboot, Jurassic World, was a good time, but didn't stick with you. However, this one is just plain AWFUL.Sam Neill reprises his role as Alan Grant, but without any of the fun or character of Alan Grant. He has no personality in this movie, and makes stupid decisions frequently that Alan Grant should not be making. I don't even remember the names of the starring couple because they were so forgettable. They bickered constantly. but in a development everyone expected, they end up getting back together at the end after their divorce. However, they were so annoying towards each other, and made the dumbest decisions that no one would ever make, such as shouting through a megaphone in a forest of dinosaurs, that I was actively rooting for them to get eaten by a pack of Raptors. And I'm sure that there were others in the group with those three, but again, I don't remember their names or appearances due to their sheer lack of character and interest. If horrible characters weren't enough to drag down this mess of a movie, the plot makes no sense, and is filled with countless holes. Overall, there is absolutely no reason to watch this movie, no matter how much you love the series or dinosaurs, like me.",Jurassic Park III

The film is about a boy and his brother wave boarding, one day, on the outskirts of a deserted island. Unfortunately, the boat crashes, and the boy is forced to fend for himself. However, it seems that the island that the boy is stranded on is actually another Jurassic Park that was secretly under development a few years ago. It's now up to the paleontoligist from the original film to go to this island and save this young man before it's too late. The movie fails to offer anything original to the series except for a few new dinosaurs.

Watching this film was a bit like a roller coaster ride from hell. The script is lame; it simultaneously asks and then leaves too many questions unanswered. Also, we don't really get to appreciate the humans in the film for all they're worth. For example, William H. Macy is too great a talent to have to compete with dino-thugs for our attention. And Laura Dern was especially sympathetic in JP1; in this film, she's barely a blip on the radar screen.The whole JP3 experience was t o o     m u c h. Too much noise, too many surprises, too many characters dying off, too much predictable, gratuitous violence.  Word to the wise: vote yourself off this island.(I rated it a 3 for special effects; I took off the other 7 points for having absolutely no originality.)",Jurassic Park III
574,Zang-2,"A good thrill, but completely useless plots",7,24 July 2001,"***[CONTAINS EXTREME SPOILERS]***There were several problems with ""Jurassic Park III"", but there were also several good things. They did not balance out.First, it tried to have characters. The divorced couple were very obviously brought together by the experience and the love for their son. They get along now.The famous paleontologist, Grey, now appreciates the young, naïve Billy for who he is. ""Some people want to be astronomers, and some people want to be astronauts,"" preaches Grey. ""The astronomers get to study and love beautiful things from safety--"" ""But they never get to touch them,"" says Eric, the lost son. ""Right, Sonnie. And astronomers get right up there to mess around with things, but they don't really appreciate them. Billy wasan astronaut. You know what the last thing I said to him was--""Sorry, Grey, but I have to cut you short here. On to the second thing; it tried to have a plot. ""What? It did?"" you say. Yeah, the raptors. In the beginning, Grey gave a speech about raptor intelligence, saying they could communicate. Then Billy made a raptor larynx and blew on it to make raptor speech noises. Then they were in the old base on the island and a they trapped a raptor and heard it make a noise. Close up to Grey's face. ""He's calling for help."" And finally Grey talks to the raptors himself to save his life. It's a strong plot because people didn't believe him when he lectured.However, this plot is lame, and it seems like a good plot when I say it, but in the movie it's not obvious at all. It's poorly dealt with, as is the character development. You would totally miss it if you just came for thrills and dynonici plunging their claws into people's backs. Of course, if you came for that, you'd have left happy and wouldn't have been complaining.So, I liked it because it WAS thrilling, and when they wanted you to be grossed out, you were grossed out, and when they wanted you to be scared, you were scared, and when they wanted you to be happy, you were happy. It had funny moments, like Grey's dream of turning and seeing Billy as a raptor who says ""Alan..."". That was outrageous. I thought it was hilarious when Eric was being pecked and prodded by the baby pteredactyls. That was HILARIOUS.But the main reason it was absurd was because the whole reason Jurassic Park I and even II were worthy of any attention was because of the neat-o, brand spanking new, collosal, amazing animatronic life-size dinosaurs that were built and operated. Now it's just a computer. You know, computers, like in Tomb Raider, The Mummy I & II, Final Fantasy, Cats and Dogs, Paulie, Toy Story, Atlantis, 75% of kid's television, 100% of all D*sney movies in the last five years, &c &c &c. Wow. Computers. Maybe it was a big deal in Money For Nothing, but computer dinosaurs have been done, are old, and, besides still being adorable, do not do it like animatronic dinosaurs.Of course, animatronic dinosaurs probably could not have done it either. You need something new. So instead of writing a script we could do without just to spend years animating dinosaurs biting people's heads off, come up with new, interesting dinosaurs to grab our attention.Despite how negative this all may have seemed, I think you should go see the movie. If you don't, you will have to be tortured by guilt. See it. I mean it. It's a laugh, it's a thrill, but it's no Money For Nothing. I spent five dollars for it, but I also spent five dollars on an Arlo Guthrie record. It was well worth the five bucks I spent on it, though ""Alice's Restaurant"" was much more worth it.",Jurassic Park III

A bit of love, a familiar face, all that you'd expect.There's also a mighty number of inaccuracies in the movie. Dinosaurs slam their way trough four inch steel bars, designed to withstand them, without any problem, but are then avoided by running into a small, half-collapsed building, which resists the dinosaurs' attempts to enter.But even if you put your brain on standby, and just watch the pretty pictures, you'll notice they aren't particulary pretty. In fact they're no better than the first Jurassic Park. That one was good in it's time, but nowadays computer animation is a lot better usually. Seems Amblin isn't quite capable of keeping up. The close up dinos aren't so bad, but it seems there have been some mighty budget cuts on scenes with many dinos. The big herds move awkwardly, and seems to stand in front of the landscape rather than in it.Altogether you get an utterly predictable movie, without even the occasional moment of tension the first film provided, and without any great images worth mentioning.

The raptors didnt look all the same as they did in the other 2 films but this time they are like Michael Crichton described them in the books.

There's a lot of revisitation of the past two movies which made the franchise so famous and rich.  Definately got the old characters back and old dinosaurs stomping their familiar trademark.  Nothing to disappoint, nothing revolutionary.  But who wants complication or complexity, I mean it IS the summer, isn't it??

589,Moviemasterh80,"A Step up from ""II"",but nothing major",7,2 October 2001,"Jurassic Park III is a step up from ""II"",but(take my word for it)nothing major. In my opinion it's better than ""The Lost World: Jurassic Park II. However, not better than the first. The second was, plain and simply, silly and seemed to be proud of it. ""JPIII"" is the perfect summer movie. Unlike ""II"", which was too long for me, this movie goes by quickly and pleasantly.
GOOD QUALITIES: Dr. Alan Grant is back, eight years older but not wiser! The special effects(CGI)are as magnificent thanks to thousands of special effects wizards.(The dinosaurs move and run as realistic as ever) The animatronic effects are great too thanks to Stan Winston and his team. The action is packed in a tight little 95 minute package which is good! (Never a dull moment) The comedy is good, which I think the series needs as of this point. They've got a new dinosaur loose in the series, the spinosaurus, which is very cool.BAD QUALITIES: It has imagination but lacks originality.(It's the same old same old but ten times better) Some of the dialogue is so retarded that at times it's unbearable! Tea Leoni's character, Amanda Kirby, is very annoying.(I was kind of hoping for her to die) The script is bad(the biggest drawback)and it took four people to write it. You can tell that David Koepp,the writer of the first two, didn't write this. Steven Speilberg isn't back to direct and it shows, but Joe Johnston did a good job.So ""Jurassic Park III"" gets a7/10, 84% from a 100%, B from an A+, Good!",Jurassic Park III
590,mentorrus,Disgraceful,1,25 November 2002,"Bad can't really describe this abomination of the Jurassic Park series other than who ever even made this film really rip off the fans. No script, no story, bad bad acting, and an ending that really says it all makes this one of the worst movie ever made. Who ever even says that this movie is ether better than the first or the second or to put bluntly any good at all is ether working for the studio or is on very heavy medication. 
Keep away, it's as bad as people have been saying.",Jurassic Park III
591,therevue8,This movie is Steven Spielberg's way of giving his middle finger to his fans.,1,29 December 2002,"Tedious and pointless follow up to Jurassic Park and The Lost World leaves behind the sense of wonder and fun of it's predecessors, and instead becomes a by the numbers B monster movie that really does not even make a serious attempt to be any good at all. The acting is horrible, as well as the special effects and there is really no feasible plot line to go by.  This movie was only made to capitalize on two much better films, and judging by the lack of class this production seems to have had, It shows that Spielberg really did not care what so ever if this movie was any good or not. It seems to me that the only thing he did care for was a quick pay check, and not the quality that made the first two movies so great.What a shame, and the sad part about it is that Spielberg is seriously considering making Jurassic Park 4.Avoid at all cost.",Jurassic Park III
592,dumb2ugly,Sometimes the bad word of mouth is justified.,1,5 June 2003,"I heard reviews raging from bad to horrific concerning this film, and I still wanted to see it regardless of the extreme bad word of mouth. The word of mouth had kept me away from it for so long because I'm such a fan of the first two films, and I didn't want to ruin the experience of those films by watching this movie but I gave in out of sheer weakness. Now I know why the movie received all the bad feedback.The movie is a complete mess from start to finish. The plot absolutely makes no sense what so ever, even going as far as to contradict itself in certain points of the film. The acting is tepid at best, with Sam Neil giving the best performance out of the group, which is not a big feat considering the fact that he's sleep walking through out the entire movie. Jeff Goldblum is not in this film, and it's painfully obvious because he at least brought an intelligent sense of reality and danger to the first two movies, and top of that he was interesting character to follow. The cast of characters in this film are so unbearable to watch that you as the viewer will want to be transported into the movie in order to kill each of them in a slasher movie kind of way.  Interesting enough, The movie itself feels more like a slasher film that a Jurassic Park Flick because the dinosaurs look and act like murderous monsters that actual animals.Speaking of Dinosaurs mind you, the big creatures are more like live action puppets than the real dinosaurs we saw in the first two movies. I don't know what happen but these dinosaurs can't be from Stan Winston, because he of all people should know how to make a monster but hey, he like every one involve with this cinematic piece of trash probably took the easy way out thinking that people were stupid enough not to notice. In reality, who were they kidding? Themselves actually, because the movie itself is now being touted as one of the worse films ever made, and it deserves that reputation.It's a give that a sequel will never live up to the original, but The Lost World at the very least a worthy effort to The original.  This film does not even deserve to ride on those movie's reputations which it shamefully does.",Jurassic Park III
593,arky-saw,Shame to the Jurassic Park franchise,5,22 October 2013,"The film takes place on Isla Sorna, the island from the second film, after a divorced couple tricks Dr. Alan Grant into helping them find their son. It is the only film in the series that was neither directed by Steven Spielberg nor based on a book by Michael Crichton, though numerous scenes in the film were ultimately taken from Crichton's novels.The characters in this film are hard to sympathize with. They are highly annoying and as cruel as it sounds I wished they all got ate. The special effects are inconsistent, especially in the T-Rex versus Spinosaur scene. Blood reappears, disappears, etc. and there are many scientific inaccuracies and even some scenes that are literally impossible like a cell phone being able to be heard from MANY yards away in a spinosaur's stomach. This is among hundreds of problems that the movie has that I won't list here due to not having enough space.I do not recommend this film and I can only hope that JP4 is better.",Jurassic Park III
594,migz0621,"Step aside T-Rex, Spino's here!",6,19 October 2012,"When I was a little kid, about 6 when this movie was released, I ABSOLUTELY LOVED IT! especially the tumbling plane fuselage action.and it's totally brilliant, going with a new carnivore instead of with the same old T-rex, the fight scene between the Spinosaurus and T-Rex was like ""Move over Rex, you've had enough screen time!"" it is very symbolic on how the (JPIII's) director & Writers managed to introduce a new Anti- Hero well, So I give them two thumbs up. Also, it's short compared to the first two, since you have a small set of characters, I also wanna comment on the Pteradon action, in which makes them the tertiary Anti- hero.(The Velociraptors are the secondary)but one really odd thing on the Spinosaurus, why does he/she keep stalking the group? I mean, The Velociraptors have their reason because of their eggs, but why you chase them Spino?overall, i highly recommend this movie, it does not deserve it's 300 million box office, it deserves more!",Jurassic Park III
595,holburns,Unexpectedly good!,7,12 February 2012,"I never expect any 'Part 3' to a movie to be good, as a sequel just about makes it in most cases. But Jurassic Park III was surprisingly good and packed with action! Really good movie from the start to the end as the beginning gets the audience hooked immediately. I expected the scenes to be a bit weak but some good ideas are thrown into the mix, plenty of suspense and excitement. The characters are well cast. What I liked about this movie is; that it gets straight into the action, straight into the storyline engaging interest from start to finish. The first Jurassic Park movies were great and you always expect some ideas to be copied in some way or another but this was a great original addition. The direction of some of the chase scenes are very well done and does leave that butterfly feeling in your stomach just like the other two movies did.",Jurassic Park III
596,okcomputer69,Jurassic Porn,4,26 July 2005,"This movie reminded me a lot like a basic porn movie. It was short when compared to the first two Jurassic Park movies; only 90 minutes long like most sex flicks. There was basically no plot, no character development, and no Jeff Goldblum. It really reminded me of a porno, because the characters would talk alittle bit, and then get chased by dinosaurs for a long extended period of time. Now, if you just replace the aspect of getting chased by dinosaurs with some hot guy/girl, girl/girl, guy/guy, guy/gerbil, or dino/dino sex action; then you basically have the same movie. This movie is terrible compared to the first JP, and bad when measured up to the sequel. Now JP2 was no masterpiece either, but I will take very cheesy T-Rex smashing through San Diego any day, before hearing that damn cell phone go off again. Am so glad that JP4 is currently titled ""The Extinction"", because after this installment this franchise needs a nice big fat Hailey's comet to smash right into it leaving every dinosaur/character dead expect Jeff Goldblum. Goldblum is the man!!!! Anyway, you will get some entertainment value from the dinosaurs, but don't except much. Just turn off your brain, and enjoy a semi fun ride which includes getting chase by dinosaurs, getting chased by flying dinosaurs, getting chased by more dinosaurs, and yea thats about it. I should have probably have given this movie at least a five, for its effort; but the ending was so stupid and abrupt that I had to dock it a point. Its worth one viewing, and one viewing only.",Jurassic Park III
597,supa_fun-1,People are coming down on this way too much.,10,20 August 2004,"I mean, really? What's the big deal. Dinosaurs chasing people on an island is what Jurassic Park is all about.I loved Jurassic Park 3. The dinosaurs were incredible. The RAptors were smarter, faster, and had feathers! They actually appeared as villains in this film rather than monsters. Sure Spinosaurus took T-Rex's place, but who can look at a twenty five foot tall, fifty foot long monster, running around eating people, as a bad thing in the Jurassic Park franchise? I missed the T-Rex, and hope that it gets more screen time in Jurassic Park 4. However, the Rex/Spino fight was incredible. Also, I loved the Pteranodons. I for one have been wanting to see them in each film since I left the theater in 1993, having just seen Jurassic Park.Sure, the actors could have been a bit better, and the storyline could have used some work. But hey, it's hard to come up with ways of getting people on the island. I personally would have rather seen Spielberg directing the movie though.That's my thoughts.",Jurassic Park III
598,oscar-stainton,A True Disappointment,5,20 August 2013,"As problematic as 'The Lost World' may have been, it did expand the horizons of the Jurassic Park universe, 'Jurassic Park III' was a huge step backwards. The characters are sub-standard, the story is lazy and shamefully contrived, and the effects aren't as good as either of the previous movies, almost seeming to be a parody of a Jurassic Park film.The plot, as thin as it is, centres around the rescue of a boy named Eric who ended up stranded on the now restricted Isla Sorna, and the survival of the rescue team led by Alan Grant. Alan is lured to Isla Sorna by seemingly rich businessman Paul Kirby on the promise of cash to fund his dig. The plane lands and Amanda Kirby, Paul's wife, attracts the attention of Spinosaurus which causes the plane to crash and devour members of the crew. The rest of the movie is a series of chase scenes involving the Spinosaurus and the Velociraptors, interrupted by cloying domestic drama between the Kirbys reuniting with Eric and coming back together. The climax itself is unsatisfying, requiring a military deus ex machina that just feels tacked on.In all fairness, Sam Neill does a good job at bringing a jaded Alan Grant to the screen, working with what little he had. But his character is ruined by undoing his arc in the first film about learning to love kids and marrying Ellie, here Ellie is married to another man with two children. The writers could have prepared something special involving Alan and Ellie's relationship and their place in the world with live dinosaurs on the planet; it was insulting to undo all that development. His scenes in the prologue had potential, showing Alan's struggle to keep palaeontology alive and rekindle his love of dinosaurs. But it all amounts to nothing.The film has only a few worthwhile action scenes, specifically the Raptor attacks and the group's encounter with a colony of Pteranodons in a giant aviary, a memorable scene conveyed with an eerie and mysterious atmosphere. Some of the musical cues are melodic and charming, but I yearn for John Williams's talent. At times, the visual effects for the Raptors are actually quite good, but the rest are incredibly rushed and don't allow the audience to soak it in like in the first film. Due to the weak writing and wasted characters there are the many stupid moments throughout the movie. Barely twenty minutes into the film, Alan has a dream about a talking raptor on the flight to Sorna, it's intended to be scary and foreshadow the Raptors' capability of speech but it comes off as childish and goofy. (Real life raptors weren't even capable of human-level speech patterns). The ever annoying Amanda Kirby seems to exist only to scream, bicker and run away, never contributing anything but maudlin or moronic moments. William H. Macy is completely wasted. The rest of the characters are bland and forgettable. Some outright stupid moments include a satellite phone being heard from the belly of a Spinosaurus, said Spinosaur is shown as being able to break a fence designed to contain dinosaurs yet cannot break down a rusty metal door, a ridiculous cameo of Barney (I wish I was joking!!), and a cheap regurgitation of the dino dung scene from the first film.Even the dinosaurs themselves have been ruined; the CGI herbivores are pushed to the background with little screen time, and the carnivores don't behave like real animals, like in the previous films. The animatronics are clunky and the CGI is too obvious. The movie tries to recreate the sense of awe and wonder from the first film, but it feels forced and artificial.The most obnoxious change is the addition of the Spinosaurus. While I accept that it was larger than T-Rex, Spinosaurus was not a rampaging movie monster that hunted human-sized morsels like a serial killer. This leads into the infamous duel between the Rex and the Spinosaur, and it's a problem because the T-Rex was an integral part of the previous films and a childhood favourite. The fight itself was overly brief and anticlimactic. The T-Rex was set up as a predator with both ferocity and nobility, having it dispatched in such a way feels like a cheap shot. It was just a botched attempt to showcase a dinosaur that hadn't earned it's stardom like the Raptors.What frustrates me the most about 'Jurassic Park III' is that there was potential to make up for some or more of the shortcomings of 'The Lost World'. Instead it's the shallowest and the least adventurous film of the entire trilogy, there's too much focus on the domestic drama. While the first two films dealt with themes of science, technology, playing god, and man vs. nature, 'Jurassic Park III' took the franchise away from exploring such themes, choosing to be safe and marketable and lacking in substance.",Jurassic Park III
599,david-basford3,A great idea but leads to problems,7,23 July 2016,"I spent most of this film rooting FOR the dinosaurs - just ANY dinosaur (or even a cliff plunge death) upon Paul and Amanda Kirkby. I thought the film NEEDED the death of one early on - particularly Amanda. Not that the actress was bad (Tea Leoni was awesome in the role) - but the role ripped the viewer of ANY sympathy of her as a mother. I sat there thinking - please kill them off so we're not having to suffer this ""silly action despite what you are told scream-fest"" But it IS part of the plan of the film - you are supposed to want them to be gone so the film can show your another side and win them round - typical of Spielberg sentimentality. Be warned Blu-ray viewers there are some scenes that are not hi-res or are filmed in such low light that they are grainy. One sad example is when Sam and Eric are just about to leave an old truck they slept in - one scene really grainy - before and after not... Also, a detractor for me was the 'smart guy being dumb' thread from previous films. Those were my negatives - some positives... the suspended threat in the aviary was well done (now clichéd but in 1990s less so). But the illogical solid stairs collapse (i.e. the simple route) but flimsy walkways can still be used is a bit cliché.The film picks up but still couldn't help but think that the parents dying (or at least the mother) would have been better for the film (though perhaps not for the target audience)",Jurassic Park III
600,elprofessional,Jurassic park 3........ sucks!!!!!!!!!11,7,13 April 2006,"First off, this movie is one of the worst ever made. They should'v stopped making Jurassic park movies right after the second movie. The effects in this one are terrible, The raptors look so stupid, the actors suck except for Sam Niel, The new dinos suck, stupid Spinosaurs! Worst dino ever, The action was lame also. I saw this in the theaters with excitement. 30 minutes into the movie; I dropped my popcorn and left! Bad! Was this movie Bad? Yes! The worst movie of 2001. If the scary movies were making fun of a movie, I hope they pick this one!! What a bad movie!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I just hope they make Jurassic park 4.If they did, It won't make any money at all, they have the worst director of all time. Joe Johnston? What other stupid has he made? I don't know because his movies barely make it!",Jurassic Park III
601,vincesitter,Actually underrated sequel,7,14 November 2018,"Everyone seems to hate this film but it really isn't that bad. Sure, nothing compares to Steven Spielberg's classic but look at it from the filmmaker's perspective: You know this film is about dinosaurs chasing people, most of the cast is returning meaning they don't need to chart the backstory or waste time with character development. And this is what JP3 is- a taunt 90 odd minute thrill ride. The Dinos look great, the lush locations always impress and the pacing of the film is so good you'd be hard pressed to find where the time went. This is a good film and if you like the JP series or just love Dinosaurs you should watch Jurassic Park 3.",Jurassic Park III
602,JP-20,Great Dino-Time!,10,16 July 2001,"Reading earlier comments made by some people who have seen this film, I have to wonder if they actually saw the film at all.  Anyone who saw this film and posted a negative review obviously missed the point entirely of this picture.This is a great movie, and a worthy successor in the famous (and successful) Jurassic Park franchise.  Spielberg was not in the director's chair for this third installment (he had promised the late Stanley Kubrick that he would do A.I.) but his protege Joe Johnston (who also directed rampaging CGI animals in ""Jumanji"") did a marvelous job and brought his own touches and techniques onto the scene, giving the series a fresh new look and feel.Despite complaints that this movie is ""only 90 minutes long,"" a lot of action is packed into that time.  The movie never felt too short, and the 92-minute time is just right.  You think it would be better to have an extra half-hour of pointless talk or meaningless action just to say that this movie is 120 minutes?  We already know the background story, so that kind of thing, present in the first two JP movies, is not needed here, and is graciously absent.If you know your dinosaur facts, then you know that the raptors are not ""laughable"", but are actually as accurate as they have ever been, as new discoveries prove that they really did in fact have feathers and were able to communicate.  Also, accept the fact that the tyrannosaurus was not the largest carnivore.  Just because we give an animal a name that means ""tyrant lizard king"" doesn't mean it really was one, and we know that the spinosaurus seen in JP3 (which WAS a real dinosaur) was indeed larger and stronger than T-rex, as were several other carnivorous dinosaurs that aren't seen in this film.This, like JP1 and Lost World, is not a kid's movie. Don't be fooled by last year's ""Dinosaur"" that all dinosaur things are kids stuff.  JP3 is scary, violent, and intense (even moreso than the first two), and it is meant for teens and adults.  Shame on the parents who bring their preschoolers to see this movie, only to have them scream and cry throughout a few of the movie's more panicking sequences.  Send the kiddies off to see ""Shrek"" and leave this one for the age 10+ crowd.Sam Neill is back as Dr. Grant (thankfully... no offence to Jeff Goldblum's character) and Laura Dern makes a couple of (sometimes humurous) cameos. The cast of humans are all great, and the human element - character development, etc. - is stronger than it was in the previous installments. But the real stars are the dinosaurs.  In 1993, everyone said ""Wow, those movie dinosaurs look real.""  With this movie, you will be saying ""These aren't movie dinosaurs, they ARE real.""JP3 has a terrific story line and plot.  In one sentence, I would say that this is one big wonderful entertaining thrill-fest.  Not all movies have to be complicated pieces of artsy-fartsy junk filled with symbolism and iconography and complex plot twists.  Sometimes you just want to relax and be entertained by a big popcorn thriller without having to think 40 steps ahead in the action.  Jurassic Park III fills the bill perfectly, and then some.",Jurassic Park III

It just isn't as good as the original, although it was slightly better than The Lost World (JP2). While watching JP3 I was praying: please please, no T-Rex in the City .... that was simply too awful and tacky. Thank god they stuck the whole piece of action to Isla Sorna. We see new dinosaurs for the first time, such as the Spinosaurus, while revisiting familiar ones like the T-Rex and Velociraptors.A bit of spoiler: T-Rex ain't the king here anymore.The overall mood of the film wasn't as dark as I thought it would be, and there were certain comic relief moments. No gymnastics though, thankfully (that was TACKY), but no exciting ""hold on to your edges"" chases either.At least they tied JP3 to some of the original characters in JP: Alan Grant and Ellie, with a brief mention of John Hammond.Overall it was OK ... maybe cuz we're all jaded by raptors and t-rexes.",Jurassic Park III

Not the tired ones already shown in the previous two.  Sure it featured a Rex and Raptors, but they werent the prominant ones.  The story kinda slowed alittle in the middle but kept me interested.The only problem I had was, that the dinosaurs seemed too computer generated.  Personally, the dinosaurs from the first film looked more real than in this installment.  It seemed that they were striving to make these dinos too real.

The only complaint was the sudden ending and faint surprise at the lack of the now traditional false ending. I don't know why they did this but I could have happily sat through another 20 mins.I'm relieved to be able to leave the cinema without the empty feeling so many of this year's crop of blockbusters left me with. It's not a great film but it is decent enough. Certainly better than The Mummy Returns, Tomb Raider, et al. (I have watched some trash this year)",Jurassic Park III

I missed it in the first movie, but thought this was a great presentation of the dire circumstances in which Grant finds himself.  Top notch acting in this one with a great cast.  Yes it was on the short side, but the story was set well, progressed within reason, and then took us for a ride.  Good product and much more enjoyable than Mummy or Tomb Raider. Now, for JP 4, they've got to incorporate the ""invisible"" dinasaurs from the second book!

William H Macy simply recreated his fargo persona to play the tile salesman and as for the rest of the cast? well, It´s nice to be nice so I won´t comment on their atrocious performances.

I found ""The Lost World"" was stupid and boring, so I didn´t expect a lot for this third episode. But I was wrong... Jurassic Park III has more action, more thrills and more surprises than TLW by far! I really like the flying dinosaurs scene and it´s always a pleasure to see the Velociraptors in action.And, of course, bringing back Sam Neill and Laura Dern to the serie was a really good decision... There characters are more interesting than Jeff Golblung´s Malcolm, and Sam Neill is an excelent actor! In contrast, I found Tea Leoni and William H. Macy -specially Leoni- deserve to end eaten by the dinosaurs. And I think Alessandro Nivola is a real discovery. I really like his acting, and I hope to see his character, Billy, in Jurassic Park IV!!! Alongside Neill and Dern, of course.People say the movie is short... Well, I think it has the right length for this kind of fun-film... In these days, many films have the problem of being TOO long. They say the ending is bad. It´s no good, I agree. But the end of ""Jurassic Park"" was not better (Remember? The T-REX appears suddenly, eats the Velociraptor and allows humans to run to the helicopter and... that´s it). They say there are holes in the plot... I don´t agree: The script is simple but very effective. Some things are predictable or unbelievable?

Just as hokey as the first two.One thing I saw in the movie theater was a family with a young child, maybe three or four.  I think this film is WAY too intense for a child that age. I predict a few nightmares for the tyke, because the dinos are BIG, they are MEAN, and they are LOUD.

I don't understand anyone that would see this film expecting some intricate plot or deep message, they already did that in the first one.  This film is just an excuse to get Sam Neill back on the island getting chased by dinos, and what's wrong with that?  I feel sorry for all the people that didn't enjoy it, they seem to have lost their flair for movies that are just fun to watch, not to analyze.  Usually it's the critics that do this, but this film's actually gotten pretty strong reviews, because they recognize that it accomplishes what it's trying to do.  What kind of criticism is it to say that it's not realistic??!!!  It's called science-FICTION for a reason. Why you would see a dinosaur picture expecting realism is beyond me.  Sure, Dr, Grant is too easily persuaded to go back by the island, but did you really want them to waste 30-45 minutes of the movie coming up with an elaborate way to get him back there that would probably not be any more believable anyway?  No, we all know he's gonna end up back there, so just get him there, and that's what they do.  Sure it has no character development and they're all one-dimensional, sure the plot is predictable, sure it left the door open for yet another sequel, but so what?

Some say the dinosaurs looked like plastic and others say that it was just stupid. Perhaps - but this is entertainment for kids. It is just fun. It does not need to make sense. The Marx Bros never made any sense, but they were fun to watch. While watching my wife was screaming, ""Watch out - OH NO !!!!!!""

There's also so many holes in the plot of the whole jurassic park world and they don't try to do anything with them.

618,soundfreq,Parent Trap - Jurassic Park Style (SPOILERS),2,8 April 2002,"Let's just review the plot here:A separated couple is reunited on dinosaur island at the gory expense of some extras.  An 11 yearold boy survives for 8 weeks in a hostile environment which a large well-funded corporation could not.  Disbelief is greatly suspended as a supporting actor survives an attack from 4 or 5 hungry pterodactyls, and Dr Grant makes peace with the Raptors by communicating with them. Oh yeah - Laura Dern has a cameo.Wa-f***ing-hooApparently Spielberg and Joe Johnston were out to flex their SFX muscles and show some new dinosaurs (especially one that could kick a T-Rex's ass) that they didn't in the first two, as well as to lead the way for some sequel involving political relations with a newly formed raptor democracy.  I imagine some Raptors take humans hostage in their Washington DC embassy, and a team of specialists are inserted to rescue the hostages without killing any raptors (who have just developed nuclear weapons).  Of course Dr Grant would be the reluctant leader/translator along with Ellie Degler (who's young son was on a tour of the embassy with his kindergarten class) and a large team of extras to be devoured in new and unusual ways.  Of course Dr Grant's nonspecific pessimism regarding politicians' dinosaur red tape will be played up, and some new mutated form of raptor will astound and terrify the team.  Ultimately, all important characters will live as will only one of the extras (most likely the one with the most lines).  Peace will be reached with the raptors just before their embassy turns into a spaceship and blasts off.  The movie will end with a Dr Grant telling a notso funny joke about raptors and humans and everyone (despite the gruesome memories of their numerous acquaintances dying horrible deaths in the previous 2 hours) laughs heartily. The END.Hopefully for release directly to TV (preferably to USA Up all Night)",Jurassic Park III
619,perhapsitwasutah,JPI was a masterpiece compared to this...,1,21 July 2001,"I went into this movie expecting absolutely nothing in the area of characters and plot. I got just that- a short, meaningless plot with lifeless, cardboard characters running about. Contains spoilers I did, however, expect to get some decent dinosaur effects. I did not get even that. Instead of the harsh, animalistic dinos we got in JPI, we get stupid looking, obnoxiously colored, clearly animatronic dinosaur puppets (for some odd reason, the raptors are blue and red, with MOHAWKS!!).Now lets talk about plot...there is not one. The plot seems to have been invented by my five year old cousin. It consists of Sam Neil and company running and....running...oh, yes...and running- away from dinosaurs. That is the plot.The film is so full of inconsistencies that I felt ill by the time the credits rolled (even though only about an hour and 20 minutes had passed).How exactly did this mysterious ""finned, T-Rex killing"" dinosaur get on the island?How did a 12 yr old boy manage to survive 8 weeks on an island that trained mercenaries lasted 3 minutes on?How did the Raptors turn blue and red, and get those fantastically stupid mohawks on their heads?How did Dr. Eli Satler understand that Dr. Grant was trapped on Isla Sorna, simply from a mysterious phone call in which he says ""help me!""Where exactly did Dr. Grant learn how to speak Raptorese?Why is this franchise being continued?So many un-answered questions that I could care less if they have an answer to.There is no time taken to develop characters in this movie, so we (the audience) care nothing for the characters in the film. I could care less whether they died or not. As soon as the film begins, the pointless action starts, and it doesn't end until their predictable escape from the island.This film is not worth debating, and certainly not worth seeing. When I spent $8.50 on a short, pointless, irritatingly illogical film such as this, I was angered severely.Anyone who likes this film obviously cares nothing for integrity and quality in movies. This film sets an all-time low for motion pictures. If a movie gets any lower than this, than it is made by a 12 yr old with a video camera in his garage.Pointless plot. Cardboard actors. Bad director. Truly horrible film. For your own sake, SEE SOMETHING ELSE!!",Jurassic Park III
620,brandon82284,A slap on the hands!,6,1 August 2001,"The problem with sequels today is they don't get the job done.  Take the Jurassic Park series for example.  The first was a memorable experience, no questions asked.  Number two was slightly below the first, but still farther and greater than most sequels.  And then a third comes.  And here is where my review comes into place.The summer of 2001 has greatly dissapointed me, there has been not one decent movie that has captured audiences everywhere and broken Box Office records.  It seems to me JP3 was a huge dissapointment.
I will start with the upper end of the movie.  The graphics, the sound, good thrills, and new monsters make this movie an average sequel.  It was good to have Sam Neil back in the driver seat.  He is great in this role, and in my opinion is what really kept me from hating this movie.
Now the black part.  For one I really don't know why the twelve people that wrote this movie couldn't put together a better script.  The beginning was okay, the body of the film was slightly below average, and the ending of the movie, made me darn right angry.The beginning sets off good in reuniting the characters, and telling why they need to go back.The body was below what I expected in the fact that 3 or 4 people died right when they got there and the worse part of that, was I didn't even see who died or when and where!  That whole scene with the airplane left me dazed and confused at who was even alive and how they died.  Too many people died at the beginning and you knew who was going to live and who would die before you land on the island its too simplistic.  The script had no imagination at all in the chase scenes and no new approach to the way the dinosaurs were. In fact the whole movie seems more cartoon fiction than science-fiction adventure.The ending was such a joke because of what made the first and second movies so great, the raptors and the thrill of them hunting the characters.  You will be as stunned as me when you see how they survive when surrounded by a herd of raptors.I think this movie had potential, but was greatly deminished by the lack of effort by the writters, and the director.  I think Speilberg is the only man who can man handle JP series, and better be in for the next one or the whole Jurassic Park name will be greatly ruined.  They better not end on this note or it will be a real shame.More than likely you'll walk away felling very dissapointed.5 of 10",Jurassic Park III
621,earthprime,"Good, but not going to knock your socks off",8,30 July 2001,"The dinosaurs were awesome.  They looked so real you could really believe it was happening.  Of course, the concept is no longer new, and there's no Jeff Goldblum and Samuel L. Jackson, and only a cameo by Laura Dern, so it lacked the punch of JP1, which was a great movie.  JP3 is so much better than the Lost World, which was a total turkey.  All in all, a good movie, worth going just to see the dinosaurs, but not going to knock your socks off.",Jurassic Park III
622,movieking2029,Disappointing Sequel,6,18 July 2001,"I just watched the first show of JP3 on the first day of its release. I was expecting a better show than what I watched. Now I understand why Steven Speilberg didn't direct this movie. I am a huge fan of Lost World: Jurassic Park and I also liked the original. This film lacks the good acting, nice story lines and crisp direction of the first two movies. I remember from Lost World, it was thrilling right from start when the little girl discovers the velociraptors on island beach. The new movie does not thrill at any moment. A movie such as this can usually overcome bad story by providing thrilling action sequences, spectacular sceneries and good special effects and it could have done that only if more work had been done. Lost World had twice as many dinosaurs than this movie and I have seen better quality dinosaur effects in Disney's Dinosaur than here. Also, there were no nice daylight shots of the greenery or beach side of island. This movie feels like a cheap follow up to two of the biggest blockbusters on the movie history. This installment in the series is an insult to the name Jurassic Park.",Jurassic Park III
623,BatmanTheGreat,Great fast-paced action,6,24 July 2001,"Although this may not be the best of the Jurassic Park series, it is still a very respectful flick, and considering it lasts for only 90 minutes it manages to pack more dino action than a Velociraptor could shake it's claw at. The tense moments are timed to perfection and it is great to see a host of interesting characters. However the film does have its sour moments, the storyline is quite poor compared to the others and the humour just doesn't fit in that well, yet it still gets a thumbs up from me, I would recommend you seeing this if you liked the first two a lot, but if you thought the Lost World was bad, then you probably wouldn't want to see this.",Jurassic Park III
624,SirAndyL,insulting,1,25 January 2002,"Let's talk, for a moment, about the first one, and what made it work. Mostly, it was because it created a kind of ""dream world"" for anyone who was fascinated by dinosaurs. It did something that had never been done before; to show a realistic depiction of what a prehistoric world might have been like. However, this more recent edition to the ""JP collection"" was more like a monster movie than one about dinosaurs. Aside from the bad acting and extremely lame story, it simply failed to capture my imagination the way the first one did. It came across as just another horror flick, yet never scared me once (I was usually laughing during the ""scary"" parts). One thing I should mention is that today, with all that can be done with computers, special effect are no longer special like they used to be. Anyone can make a creature like a dinosaur look real. So it almost becomes a joke when someone makes a big summer film like this, and it has already been done several times before. Let's face it, we will never be surprise by seeing a dinosaur in a movie again, but film makers still seek to cash in on good movies like the first Jurassic Park by making unimaginative sequels. So, in short, I felt that Jurassic Park 3 was just another boring, unoriginal, cash in flick with possibly the worst ending in cinema history.",Jurassic Park III
625,Libs,"This time, well this time, it's not just a very bad movie, it's even worse",2,13 August 2001,"People, people, you owe it to yourself to avoid this movie.It's a stinker, as much as the pile of dino-dung used once again to make a rip-off joke from JP:I.In fact, JP:III feels like a parody of JP and to a lesser extent, one from The Lost World. Nothing makes sense in that doomed excuse for a script. Nothing. They killed the T-Rex, they blew sky-high the whole raptors concept and they just made Grant a Dino Chow Indiana Jones.Okay, let's see what's in this waste of time...ACTINGThe acting is atrocious. Dont get me wrong, I like Sam Neil as much as the next guy and I honestly think he is one example of and underrated actor who should get a lot more credit for his work. Neil just tries his best at using his ""Wide open eyes (TM)"" as soon as he sees a dino but it's pretty much it. Macy and Leoni are plain bad, like they dont care. Scream here, run over there, scream again, include corny dialogue, END. Woah, and you get paid for this??? Only decent part is from Alessandro Nivola (Billy), but as soon as he gets too emotional toward the end of the movie, it all goes downhill.I never thought I'd miss Jeff Goldblum that much..SCRIPTPretty darn simple, you could have come up with something better. Throw in action scenes : humans vs Bid Bad Nameless Dino, humans vs Flying Dinos, humans vs Talking Dinos and stitch everything together with the lamest trick to include a kid in a movie and Voila! You have a 90 minutes ""story"". Come on.Oh, I forgot : stomp over every inventive idea of the first movie. Who needs intelligence, it's an action movie isnt it?Question : Why is the Bid Bad Dino chasing after humans when it can have a T-Rex for breakfast??? If the raptors are so intelligent, why dont they build a cruise boat or order an internet connection??The only good idea was the Pteranodons. Kudos for something that was left off the first two movies. Flying dinos with an attitude, scary.Except for the very nervous guy sitting next to me, nobody in the audience seemed really moved by some of the ""surprise"" moments. You can see them coming from miles away and it all comes down to a point where you want to laugh, not cringe in your seat.FXNot even close. In JP, we were amazed at the technical feats the FX guys put up. Now we're just plain fed up. And what is it with the winamp skins? Why are the dinos looking like they bought new sets of scales?? They evolved to the point of fashion victims? Even the raptors looked different. Smaller, leaner, greener.That new Bid Bad Dino is just a download from the Godzilla movie (remember how that movie was bad? well, JP:III is not even a notch higher).
The scenery is amazing, what a beautiful island, but that's not the point.In JP, Grant was completely overwhelmed by dinos, like we did. We all were amazed. But now, he just feels fed up (yeah, much like us. See my point?).If you want to see a parody movie, go see Scary Movie 2. If you want to laugh, go see Evolution. And for your dinos cravings, well go visit a museum for God's sake.",Jurassic Park III
626,Platypus82,Another franchise being killed by awful sequels...,3,6 September 2001,"***SPOILERS***   ***SPOILERS*** I'm sorry, I can't put it any other way, but- this movie is RIDICULOUS. The only reason I gave it three points in my vote rather than only one is a) the dinosaurs, they're really great, especially the fight scene between [dinosaur] and [dinosaur] (no spoilers here...) and b) I've had a really great time watching it, making fun of it, laughing at it, and tearing it apart with my best friend. I mean, I laughed more in that movie than I did in Germany's comedy production of the year. The plot is non-existent, the dialogue defies description (what would you talk about in life-threatening situations? Yep, losing weight and the weather) and they could not have done a worse job fitting the action scenes together to form a movie. In addition, the ever-so-popular American ""family values"" are emphasized to the point of absurdity (""My son! I love you! Oh, big carnivorous beast standing in the background- no matter! My SON!!"")The predictability of this movie starts with the opening credits where my friend and I just sat grinning at each other, anticipating the claw that would make the ""III"". I loved Jurassic Park and boykotted The Lost World because I was convinced any sequels would ruin the first one. I watched this third one for fun (I swear, whenever I wasn't clawing at the seat or looking away because the ""eating scenes"" seem to be getting progressively gorier to make up for progressively bad plot, I was laughing my head off). Now I finally did watch Lost World, and while it was not as good as the first one, compared to this third one it's a cinematic masterpiece. And finally, before I go on to individual scenes, I have to say everything in this movie seems to be recycled from the prequels. Their flight over the island (even the music is the same!), their entering the building, overgrown with vines, the river raft scene is from JP1's novel, as is the pterodactyl scene, and so on and so on...they even stole something from ""Lord of the Flies"". And I hear that after JP3's success, JP4 is already a sure thing. I don't know whether to laugh or cry about this one...-SPOILER WARNING-
Some of my favorites from JP3: Tea Leoni's getting out of the plane on an island that's known to be dinosaur-infested, whipping out a MEGAPHONE, and starting to yell around. I'm paraphrasing a little here: ""Dr. Grant doesn't think that's a good idea."" ""WHAT?"" ""SHUT UP!!"" ""WHAAT? AM I TOO LOUD?!?!?!"" Ooops, a dinosaur! Now where did he come from? The raptor scene has already been commented by another user- it's just plain ridiculous. Raptors ""bargaining"" with the humans- if you give us back our eggs, we won't eat you. Either they're supposed to be too intelligent or too stupid. Grant's scaring them away by ""calling for help"" doesn't help. And while we're at it, they barely escape the hungry raptor, run for their lives, and Grant- stops, gapes at it for sheer eternity and comments, ""Oh my God! It's calling for help!!"" Oh, great realism. I'm not sure whether I should view the ""cellphone scene"" as further evidence of the incredible stupidity of this movie or see it as one of the few ironic hints that this movie takes itself just about as seriously as we do. (the other one would be Grant hearing a raptor talk to him in his dream, which is genuinely funny). After seeing him hunt and eat dozens of people in TLW, I find it hard to believe that T-Rex is suddenly being displayed as a scavenger (which he probably was) in this one. Furthermore, why should he fight with the spinosaur then? If one's a hunter and the other's a scavenger, they're not rivaling species. There are many other examples abound- I hate to break it to you, but everything about this movie except the dinosaur special effects is garbage.",Jurassic Park III

I grew up with a fascination for dinosaurs, and 'Jurassic Park' came out when I was young and it blew me away. 'The Lost World' has had some bad reception with the critics... but I thought it was great (Some of the best action on film!). Now JPIII has arrived, and I was sceptical at first, but this movie is also amazing. Director, Joe Johnston, has taken Spielberg's franchise and taken it into a fresh area. With a cool cast, and with the best SFX this year (the dinosaurs are soooooo realistic), and a welcome dose of quirky humour - this has to be the best movie of the summer! (I personally hated 'Planet Of The Apes' and 'Pearl Habour')Then again this might be one of the best this year... with tough competition from 'Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon' and 'The Lord of the Rings : The Fellowship of the Ring'. This movie was 90 mins of pure fun.

630,MetalHead13,Terrible!,1,14 February 2002,"In this third installment of the Jurassic Park series, Sam Neil reprises his role as Alan Grant.  (The paleantologist from the original)  First of all, I think Joe Johnston ruined the Jurassic Park feeling. In the two previous films, you care about the characters.  You actually want them to escape the hostile island.  In this film, I felt no sympathy for any of the characters besides Neil. Also, the story was terrible.  Why would Grant go back to a dangerous island, only for money.  And how could a boy survive on an island, for what was it?  Two weeks?  And when Grants ""buddies"" land, two of the special forces men get killed almost immediately.  Another thing, why would you get rid of the T-rex?  He was the main dinosaur in the two previous films, and he barely gets five minutes before he gets killed by the spinosaurus. Johnston also did poorly by making every dinosaur evil.  In the previous two, the brachiosaurus were kind.  In this movie, they have evil eyes and sharp teeth.  And where did the spinosaurus come from?  He wasn't in any of the other films, so was he hiding before?  And why were the velociraptors so smart?  Does that mean that millions of years ago, velociraptors learned to talk, then evolved into stupider animals?  The hole movie was terrible, except the affects. ( 1/10 )",Jurassic Park III

At the end Tea Leoni and William Macy come running out of the woods yelling, ""that's a very bad idea"". Shut up and get off the screen.

There is really no plot to speak off what so ever in this lousy follow up but another excuse to bring people back in contact with the dinosaurs.  The dinosaurs themselves look more like C.G.I cartoons than real animals, and when you have acting as bad as the special effects themselves, you know that the movie is in trouble.

""Too long.""Jurassic Park 3 may suffer from a few shortcomings, but gratuitous length is not one of them.Where it succeeds: The narrative is engaging and plausible. A boy gets stuck on Isla Sorna (site B, where Dinosaurs were bred), which has since been abandoned by the InGen corporation, and where Dinosaurs run rampant. The plot takes shape in the form of a basic rescue-mission, with some delicious twists added.The action wastes no time in getting kicked into high gear, remaining immune to any sort of extended sub-plots or scientific filler.There are a few new dinosaurs added to the mix, and some truly graphic deaths that will make your skin crawl with prehistoric anxiety. The acting is competent, and does not detract from the high-octane story. There are some memorable discussions and one-liners, including Dr. Grant taking a well-deserved shot at Dr. Malcolm's personality. Where it fails: Some of the CG looks highly dated in 2016, and the opening scene, where the boy is paragliding, looks like something that a guest would be able to make at a poorly executed green screen attraction at Universal Studios.In the end, it didn't further the narrative the previous two movies built. So if the positives outweigh the negatives, why did it receive such a poisonous reaction in 2001?

If any of the creators of this movie can say that it wasn't about the money with a straight face, I'd be shocked.

After what seems like an accident on the boat, the boy and his stepfather cut loose their parachute of sorts and steer towards the nearest island. This island happens to be Isla Sorna...SITE B.

After accepting, Grant and his student (billy) get more than they bargain for as the couple (the Kirby's) land the plain on the island against Grants wishes. No need to tell you that when the plain lands, it wont be taking off again without a bit of mayhem first. Something tells me there's more to this couple than they are letting on..! First things first. Jurassic park III is NOT a bad film, despite other IMDb comments you may have come across. As a film fan, and a Jurassic Park/Spielberg nut, my only MAIN sticking point with the film is that the sense of awe and suspense has gone from what the first and indeed the second had. Maybe this has something to do with Spielberg giving up the directors chair to Jumanji director Joe Johnstone. Remember the suspense of the T-Rex jeep attack in the first film or the Raptor attack in the kitchen. It left you with a sense of awe, a sort of chill as you see just how vicious some of these animals were. This is not on the agenda in JP3, the agenda it seems is thrills thrills thrills.These Thrills are very good though, with the best section of the film having to be the 'Bird-Cage- scene. A scenario that would have shone in even the original JP. The Raptors are as fearsome as ever, but the story follows an 'increased intelligence - subtle- approach with the raptors which only distances further that suspense. The 'new' dinosaur on the block is Spiny (spinosaurus) and while being a good addition to the roster, involved in a couple of good sequences, doesn't quite live up to the boots he's trying to fill...Mr T-Rex. In a greatly directed scene the Spino kills a Rex. Very impressive to watch but in all honesty, the director chose the wrong winner. It seems for every good scene that makes you sit up and take note, there is another to make you slouch again. Without giving anything away, Grants 'dream' on the plain,the 'jungle-kid' Saviour scene and the 'ringtone' scene are those that make you slouch, and for a lot of people, maybe even cringe.Sam Neil (Grant) is excellent at his role again, and bringing in William H. Macy and Tea Leoni as the Kibys adds to the impressive acting cast, helping boost the credibility of the film. The directing is very good and Stan Winstons animatronics improve all the time. It doesn't seem like anyone has made any errors with Jurassic Park III apart from totally misjudging what exactly it is that the viewer wants to see with this continuing saga.Jurassic Park III is well made and entertaining throughout. It isn't overly clichéd or delving into the deep and meaningful. Its a blockbuster. a very well made one. Its only fault was to be a sequel to a classic and fantastic film that it could never ever outdo.",Jurassic Park III

However, this movie is entertaining in its own way, and I do recommend it.",Jurassic Park III

Ideas are few, and yes, its the third Jurassic Park. Unfortunately, though many would say otherwise, I think this film ain't as cool as the original or the second film either. Its a 90 minute spesh FX sesh with booming sound, with...whats that? LESS screaming and LESS blood and guts than the original. heck, I don't even think there was any blood in JP3...or very little. Must look again. Throwing in a few new species of dinosaur and coming up with a poor and short battle scene to kill of T-Rex doesn't amuse or impress me, and perhaps many out there for that matter. Right. Thats the bad news. On the good side, there are some nice dino chases, and those ferocious little Compys are back! (Bad news again for a second: I thought the Raptors looked retarded with their dumbass new look, and were too smart. Talk about 50'000 years of evolution in eight years. Whatever.) The spesh FX are absolutely outstanding and the sound (especially the dino roars and such) are spot on. A nice sit-down-watch-and-put-away movie, and forgettable not to mention.

644,FbxCycler,An Excellent Third Film of the Jurassic Park Trilogy,10,14 June 2007,"This film is an excellent third film of the trilogy and is in many respects the best film of the three Jurassic Park movies.This film takes us back to the second island Isla Sorna, the place called Site B in the second film, where InGen first hatched and raised the dinosaurs before taking them over to the main island for the tourists (at least that was the plan) to look at.Dr. Alan Grant (Sam Niell) is lured back to Jurassic Park under the ruse of an aerial tour of the island for a mysterious wealthy businessman and his wife, (William H. Macy and Tea Leoni) as their anniversary gift to each other.It turns out that he's not what he seems and in short course, they end up trapped on the island, with some very large, very dangerous, and very hungry predators (and a few velociraptors that are using vocalizations to communicate) who want to make lunch out of them.It's an exciting, fast-paced movie, once it gets going and it doesn't let up until the very last frame.Because of the advances in computer-generated imagery since the first movie, this film easily looks and feels more ""real"" than the other two movies and the director shows what he can do with the technology available to him.This film would also be an excellent point to end the Jurassic Park series, in my view.",Jurassic Park III
645,Moligo,I can't believe they still make movies this bad!,5,19 July 2001,"I would like to start off by saying how much I loved and enjoyed the first two movies. They were wonderfully fun and extremely excellent. This one, however, was worse than almost anything I have ever seen, especially in comparison. Nearly every aspect suffered from some severe disorder: poor direction, bad acting, awful script, yada yada yada. it was however, enjoyable. In fact, I laughed and giggled and chuckled my way through out the picture. It put me in a good mood, which is a wonderful thing..only it sucked something awful. It's really a shame, because it just had so much going for it..so many possibilities. There's no valid reason for the crap this film showcased. It's a mystery, really.

646,SilentBob-1,"Better than the Second, But Doesn't Exceed The First",8,6 August 2001,"First off, I'd Like to say that I've had amazingly high expectations for this movie ever since The Lost World came out. I'm greatful to say that I wasn't disappointed. Unlike Lost World, this movie isn't just a 'more is better' version of Jurassic Park; it features whole new perils and whole new species of dinosaurs. Even the raptors, which may not be a new species, look different from the last movies.This movie is as simple as a sci fi movie can get: People get stuck on island of dinosaurs and run to get off island of dinosaurs. Somehow this formula works, but is also the movies downfall. Halfway through the film, it is mentioned that the dinosaurs had been engineered with and that ""someone has been playing God"". There's nothing wrong with this statement, except of course, that it is NEVER EXPLAINED WITHIN THE MOVIE. A whole subplot could have been added to explain this, and the movie's running time (which is a meager 88 mins.) would have been filled out. This angered me greatly by the time the ending came. And when the ending did come, I was so amazed how unsubtle and out of place it was I couldn't help but laugh.Fortunately those are the only problems I have with this film. It's different from the original, and is overall a good ""popcorn"" movie. Definately worth seeing in theatres. 8/10",Jurassic Park III
647,phobias,"JP -> ""I love it"" TLW -> ""I like it"" JPIII -> ""I LOVE IT""",9,19 July 2001,"This movie is great and impressive. Everything is great, but not their character.  This movie hasn't really focus on each character in this movie. The movie ends with weak characters.  But it didn't really bother me at all.
The story line seems interesting and simple.  This time the movie seems to focus on humans not dinosaurs. In JP - humans got the control over the dinosaurs. In TLW  humans chase the dinosaurs. Now in JPIII  humans look for a human. OF COURSE those three movies got the dinosaurs chasing the humans.  I think it's cool and also I'm very impressive with this story since I heard that the script wasn't actually done during making this movie.
The common opinions from the audience are `TOO SHORT' This movie only lasted for 102 minutes.  To be honest the story did squeeze into 102 min.  Fast paced and lots of things happening to keep your heart thumping. The action begins after 10 minutes from the beginning. This movie also have new dinosaurs, it also got the audience's attentions. The dinosaurs' evolution showed very clearly.  I love it.  This movie show more dinosaurs' intelligent. WOW!! If they're still on this god's green planet. Humans will become extinct!!!

If ever a film has simply followed the basic Hollywood equation for how to make money without really trying it's this.  From characters inserted simply to have a body count, a totally out of context explosion, to bringing someone back from the dead.  At no point was the movie ahead of the audience, well written, or innovative.  No one questions the technical expertise displayed here, but it's beginning to seem as if we've reached a point where screenplay and actors are used simply to construct a venue for the newest special effects.

Okay, I disagree with everyone who says this is better than The Lost World.  I am not saying that The Lost World was good, but it had its moments.  When the trailer was hanging off the cliff and the girl was pressed against the breaking glass, that was a tense and exciting moment.  During this third installment, i was never tense nor excited.  I was never on the edge of my seat.  SMALL SPOILER:  They never kill anyone you know anything about, let alone care about.  The reason Deep Blue Sea was so good is because Samuel L. Jackson as well as almost everyone else gets gobbled up.  A reason Jurassic Park III was so bad is because of all the people who died, I can't remember what any of them look like.
Also, at one point I thought i saw a black rope going down to Sam Neill's waist, and I thought, ""Is he about to fall?""  Right then, the step broke and he slipped and started to fall but was able to hang on. Unbelievable.",Jurassic Park III

Some positive moments were the pterodactyls,and the good up close face shot of the Brachiosaurus.  Acting was fair to say the least,but Sam Neil does a fine job,and Laura Dern (in a cameo role)looking better than ever,made me ask ""Why exactly did Billy Bob dump her for Anjelina Jolie?""

The writer has made the correct choice by not making it a necessity to those new to the JP world to have experienced parts I & II before hand and despite the usual Hollywood charm of yet another happy ending I would thoroughly recommend the film to others if only to fill a spare 90 minutes in their lives.It's a popcorn factor movie, nothing more and nothing less. However I would have personally preferred to have watched a flick that I could have got my teeth into. ...and as for a JP IV, don't count your dinosaur eggs just yet.",Jurassic Park III
654,Arctica,Makes The Lost World look good,3,23 July 2001,"This is the film in which we learn that velociraptors are ""smarter than primates"".  Please!!  The raptors as portrayed in the first film possessed intelligence far beyond their cranial capacity, but I suspended my disbelief and simply enjoyed a fine piece of movie-making.  I failed to do that in Part III.  The silly plot of this film was a very flimsy excuse to get Sam Neill et al. back amongst the dinosaurs, which this time around were rather more unconvincing than they had been in the original Jurassic Park.  The Spinosaurus and the raptors were no longer animals - they were movie monsters.  And this film showed as much respect for realism as the majority of monster movies.  Spinosaurus, an animal about which scientists know very little, was given a fish-eater's skull but with bone-crushing T-rex-like teeth.  Worse than that, it lacked the spark of life that Spielberg's dinosaurs seemed to possess.  And that, I think was the crux of the problem - Spielberg's deft touch was absent.  Okay, so The Lost World was a pretty poor offering ... but it did have its moments, and compared to Part III it suddenly doesn't seem so bad.The saving grace of this film was, in my opinion, the pteranodons.  They were new and different, and unlike the Spinosaurus they were very convincing.  Their first appearance was genuinely scary, and for me was the highlight of the film.The cast was okay.  Sam Neill is always value for money, and William H Macy is, I am convinced, incapable of giving a bad performance.  But they all suffered from having to recite uninspired dialogue and do the very stupid things that the 'plot' demanded of them.  Apparently they threw out the original script at the start of the shoot and made it up (practically) as they went along.  It's hard to imagine how the original story could have been worse than the final product.Still, it was high energy entertainment, and at under 90 minutes did not outstay its welcome.

Yes the plot is a bit silly and the acting isnt super but this film is a excellent summer movie.Starring Sam Niel (jurassic park), Tea Leoni (The Family Man), William H. Macy (Fargo, Mystery Men), Michael Jeter (The Green Mile) and Alesandro Nivola (Face Off)the third in the series introduces a new director (to the series) Joe Jonston who worked on the special effects for the star wars films and directed Jumanji who adds a fresh new look at the trilogy.The plot is pretty basic Dr. Alan Grant who's work is suffering is desperete for funds for his research on raptor intelligence, so when he  comes across Paul & Amanda Kirby  who offers him a LOT of money to go towards his research if in return give's him an aeriel tour of Isla Sorner. But when they crash on the island Grant finds out it's actually a rescue mission there there for as there son is stuck on the island.This film definitely makes up for the rubbish The Lost World provided us with.

I mean come on, the raptor said ""Allen"" and I laughed. This movie was a romance and a comedy, it wasn't scary. The dinosaurs are hardly in the movie either. If you liked the first and second JP, you will be disappointed. When the dinos are in the movie, they don't look that good. One exception, the pteridactlys look awesome, that is the only good scene in the movie. You get tired of the woman in it and begin to root for her to die. The plot is pointless and is just another opportunity for dinos to eat humans. I can see why steven speilberg was just a ""producer"". He wanted to stay away from it. In the first one, Allen Grant knew the raptors communicated to each other and in this one, he made a big deal of it. To end I just wanted to say that I was glad I spent my free ticket from the ultimate dvd pack so I don't have to see this movie again.

There weren't enough 'jump' scenes, and the best one was shown in the TV spots, which really ruined it in the theater.  This movie as well as the second Jurassic Park movie proves that a sequel is almost never as good as the original.

Steven Spielberg movies are never as good when someone else directs them (anyone remember Jaws 2, 3 and 4?).",Jurassic Park III

I always figured that Dr. Grant (Sam Neil) and Ellie (Laura Dern) would have been married, especially after the emotional bond after the first movie.  The new dinosaurs were a great addition to the Jurassic Park movies. The Pterydactyls, were very cool along with the Spinosaurus.  The T-Rex and Spino fight was cool but the T-Rex shoulda won.  When the group was digging in the Spino's dino-crap to find the phone, their unpleasant smell helped to fend off another dinosaur.  The raptors were great as usual. There was alot of comic relief.  Since the movie was 90 minutes, there were no boring parts...dinos all the time.  They coulda explained what happened to InGen and Ellie could have gone to the island to rescue them with a crew of people..not send the entire Marines and Navy after them.  Well, they did leave alot open in the story line, they could do JP-4 :)... they have enough to make another great movie...they need to get another movie so Jeff Goldblum and Sam Neil can get together again and do something with the dinosaurs.

The dinosaurs were more verocios and are much faster. the dino's look more real than ever. I prefer the T-Rex but the Spinosaurus is a good substitute. The movie was a tad short and the ending could have been better but hey this is a summer release and is well worth seeing. Sam Neil made this movie happen and Tea and Macy made the jokes in this film. Great casting but Laura Dern should have had a much bigger role than she did. She was the hero in this film.

663,DervishFinkelblatt,A fantastic followup to a mediocre followup to a fantastic movie,10,24 July 2001,"After the seemingly muted ""blah"" that was The Lost World Jurassic Park, my expectations for this third film should probably not have been too high. Spielberg had left the project (except for his role as producer), and the film was reportedly a mere 90 minutes long, but for some reason, I still held high hopes for this Joe Johnston-directed dino-flick.  Fortunately, the dissapointment of the second film was immidiately washed away by the high-octane thrill ride that is the third installment of this once-again-great franchise.  People have complained of a weak story and cheesy dialogue, but honestly, what do these people expect?  For a movie of its kind, the dialogue is actually both intelligent and humurous, and the story, though by no means original, is still exciting and attention-keeping. The performances are all decent to great, with talentless Tea Leoni giving probably her best (though still mediocre) performance of her career.  Macy and Niell both shine in there roles, each one utilizing a subdued and natural style that works well with the loose and exciting pace of the film. The new major new dino-the Spinosaurus egypticus is a great replacement for the T-rex, and it provides some of the films scariest and most thrilling moments.  The pteranadons, which are thankfully not referred to a dinosaurs, are also a great new addition, as the scene with them is probably the most tense and terrifying of the film.  Overall, a great followup after the dissapointing second film, which makes me happy to once again think of this franchise as on of the greatest ever.  Bring on #4!",Jurassic Park III
664,Brock256,Works well in its intended role; an overall good time,8,24 July 2001,"Jurassic Park III, viewed as it was intended (an action/thriller movie), is really not so bad as to deserve the harsh criticism many have heaped upon it.  Granted, it's not a likely contender for the position of most philosophical film of the year, however it was never presented as being so. The dialogue may be strained at times, but neither is it the focal point of this film; it does work well in supporting and advancing the storyline (almost to the point of being utilitarian).  The action sequences, although lacking the suspense of, say, the shockwave/water glass sequence of the first movie, do not disappoint in terms of pure, visceral excitement.  The characters, although not presented in great depth, are (Mrs. Kirby's annoying bullhorn stupidity aside) above all else *believable* - it is in this that Neill's true genius as an actor lies, and it is for this reason that I personally would like to see him cast more in movies with more developed scripts.  The dinosaurs in this movie take on much more distinct personalities than in either of the two previous entries, to the benefit of the overall feel of the film.  The greater variety of them in this movie was a pleasant surprise (the ankylosaurs were worth the price of admission for me), most particularly the very well done addition of the Pteradons.  I particularly enjoyed seeing the further development of raptor intelligence (making them all the more terrifying, while removing some of their ""monster"" taint).  I also got a kick out of various throwbacks to the first two movies, such as the Grant vs. technology bit, the ""deja vu all over again"" open-checkbook advances of Mr. Kirby, the kid's references to Grant's and Malcolm's books, the T-Rex as an occasionally heroic figure, and the closing fade-to-credits parallel of the first movie's flock of birds.Aside from the disturbingly abrupt and overscaled ending, this movie was an enjoyable thrill-packed theatergoing experience; I give it a 7 out of 10.

If you remember  Showgirls, you know that it was one sorry excuse of a movie. Jurassic park 3 is just as bad, and maybe a little worse. It's disgraces the other great films in the Jurassic Park series with ease with it's extremely brainless plot that really makes no sense what so ever once you start to think about it. The Acting is flat out awful, and the score is a bland rip off of the other two movies. On top of that, it really does not even follow the same storyline from the other two movies. At least Showgirls had some senseless T and A, and some camp humors to help you coup with what you were seeing. Jurassic Park 3 is not even funny in a bad sort of way.

672,DinosaurEmbryo,An educated critique on Jurassic Park 3,1,5 June 2002,"This contains **SPOILERS**
As it was said before by the critics, Jurassic Park 3 offers no standard to character interaction, time, feeling, story line, or believability whatsoever. The movie only relies on loud sound effects, special effects, music, and only the money from the box office. Everything else is just garbage. Whats worse is that there were four screenwriters who couldn't come near the talent of screenwriter David Keop(Screen writer for Jurassic Park and The Lost World) and who couldn't finish the final production of the script when Jurassic Park 3 started filming. And to sum it all, there was the kid's film director Joe Johnston who thought in his foolish ways to make Jurassic Park 3 light, and to settle this as a kid's movie ruining everything great and imaginable from Steven Speilberg.The plot?  Two divorced parents rent a plane for a low flying tour over the dinosaur Island and invite Dr Alan Grant as their guide. Thats all there is to the plot. They go to the Island and a couple minutes later, people start running and getting eaten. Sorry to say, but thats all there is. Couldn't those four screenwriters come up with anything better? Come on, thats more like the idea from an 8 year old.Joe Johnston doesn't want to put any thought or time whatsoever in the movie development. Instead, he ignores the standards that Steven Speilberg has set up in the first Jurassic Park movies and does things his way. He ignores how Speilberg has done the action. Joe Johnston takes the action his way making the action quick, lacking build of suspense, and having the action last only up to 2 minutes. Spielberg on the other hand does the action right making it last more than 6 minutes and adding suspense.Johnston also enforces the new ""super"" dinosaur. Its a Spinosaurus to be exact. He can take out a plane in seconds, kill off a couple merchants, and take out a T.rex. He can't scare the audience. Johnston next enforces the new ""talking"" and ""smart"" raptors. Instead of frightening the audience as Johnston wants them to do, the raptors make the audience laugh out loud.There is also stupidity. Amanda Kirby calls for her son through a loud speaker phone during a desperate situation. Paul Kirby tries to get snacks from a broken down vending machine. Billy steals raptor eggs for funding. A satellite phone survives in a dinosaur digestive system and rings. There is just more stupidity I can list on and on.Everything is so predictable. Who didn't know what was going to happen next when Amanda gazed too long at the raptor head in the lab? Who didn't know who would live and who would die in the movie? Everything is so darn predictable. This movie had to have been set out for the weak minded audience.The only better acting is from Sam Neil and William Macy. Tea Leoni's acting was horrible. Jeter's and Nivola's parts were wasted. Morgan was just randomly chosen. And the other two were just there for dinosaur food. Thats all there is to the acting.And theres more. Not only have the four screenwriters come up with corny dialogue such as ""Into the herd"", ""Into the trees"", ""Your no better than the people who built this place"", ""What was that?"", and the Barney joke, they also got away with RIPPING off from the well thought of lines in the movie Aliens. This has been noticed by other critics so I thought of mentioning it to others here. They stole ""We must leave! We must leave now!"", ""He's alive. I know he's alive and we're gonna find him"", ""No matter what turns out...it wasn't your fault"", ""It makes me wonder what else they were up to"", ""You're alive...And thats the important thing"", and ""I am so sorry you have to be here"".The film running time is only 83 minutes. That is short enough for a kid's film. It also makes the film entirely weak for just relying on quick action and sound effects without a complete story line or development.The ending was just plain weak and stupid. We later find that JP3 is also a Dr Dolittle RIP-OFF where Dr Grant magically talks to the raptors. How absurd. The raptors soon leave without killing anyone. Next, the marines randomly appear and pick up the survivors. No new action in the end happened or was climatic as Johnston promised. Billy appears after having been thought to have died. The characters are horrible in the end. They don't care at all where the Pteranadons fly off to leaving room for another HORRIBLE Jurassic Park sequel.And thats about it. Jurassic Park 3 makes William Macy, Sam Neil, and Steven Spielberg look bad. Jurassic Park 3 only craves for quick action. It was put there only for the money. It messed up the entire JP series.",Jurassic Park III

Not one part, not a single part, of Jurassic Park 3 made any sense. First off, was there a plot? I don't remember...Was it something like these parents lost their son on an island inhabited by dinosaurs, and told these archeologist that they would pay them a lot to rescue them. But wait...those parents weren't really rich at all! They faked it! Man, like that couldn't have gotten any worse. And the whole thing with the Spinosaur snapping the T Rex's neck, what's up with that? The T Rex was one of the coolest things from the first one, I mean, c'mon!

Sharknado looked like a A grade movie compared to this, that's how shoddy this film looks.First off, it's not even a sequel to the other films in the series. It's more of a remake, and a bad one to boot. The whole story makes no sense, and the acting is flat out laughable. To sum up this movie in one word is even too much to bear. Crap is one word, and trash is another. The sad part about all of this is the fact that some people (Either very sensitive small kids or extremely mentality challenge adults) think that it's better than the second film film (The Lost World). Granted The Lost World was no where near as good as the original but at least it keeps its sense of wonder and thrills. But compared to this piece of cinematic disaster, it's a masterpiece.

He's responsible for some of the worse movies ever made, and judging by the way this film was shot and performed, I would not be surprise if Joe Johnson was a devoted fan.  A good way to describe this film is to compare it to a train wreck, you feel mournful after seeing it. The story is a boring mess, and it has no coherence what so ever, and the acting is especially dreadful.  All the actors involve phone in their performances with a laziness that can only be contributed with the fact that none of them really wanted to be there.  The Special Effects are not so special, and in certain point of the film, you can see a lot of mistakes in the way the dinosaurs look and move. The direction is even a bigger joke because it lacks style, and conviction. In the first two films of the series, you felt for the characters and you felt the suspends building up. With this one, you fell nothing but the sense of being hounded by a used car salesmen trying to shove a lemon down your throat.  If you are a fan of this series, stick with the first two (Jurassic Park, and the Lost World.) Jurassic Park 3 is just a real bad cash in that merits no respect at all.",Jurassic Park III
676,the_one_only_original_me,Great special effects and nostalgia can only carry a film so lackluster so far...,5,10 May 2009,"The original Jurassic Park was a film held together by good pacing, good cinematography, convincing actors, and of course the unfair advantage of being one of the first films to showcase photo realistic CGI effects. The film was hardly a masterpiece (the story and some of the characters were fairly unrealistic, many easy-to-notice and major bloopers), but the films finer points over powered the weaknesses.Jurassic Park was basically a special effects demonstration, but a well crafted one. With that said, Jurassic Park III has more in common with its predecessor than many would give it credit for. However, JP III lacks the fore mentioned finer points that made the original work. The acting is flat, quite flat. Even Jurassic Park veteran Sam Neil, who gave a solid performance as the charter Alan Grant in the first film, is stiff in his acting this time around. The other issue is the film's pace. Jurassic Park had suspenseful timing. It would build up tension and then release it at well chosen moments. Jurassic Park III tries to just throw dinosaur themed action at you as fast as it can, without effectively building up the moment. As for the story, well it is actually pretty lame. It is a sad excuse for a sequel plot.The cinematography in Jurassic Park III isn't poorly done, but it can't compare to the cleverness of Jurassic Park's constantly iconic and dramatically chosen points of view. Not all in this movie is bad. The dinosaurs themselves don't disappoint. If anyone in Jurassic Park III should be nominated for best actor, it should be one of its CGI or animatronic cast members who are actually more convincing than the flesh and blood human cast. There are moments when it is a real challenge to tell apart the late Stan Winston's practical dinosaurs from Industrail Light and Magic's CGI ones. It is a pure delight to watch the roaring, hissing, winged, and clawed creatures interact with the scenery, fight, and destroy on the screen.

Unfortunately Poor Sam does not have the flare and coolness of the Character he played in the original Jurassic Park, nor does he have a script to work with. The rest of the cast in general is as disposable as paper and the special effects were done better before with the other movies in the series. The movie is more and less a rip off of the Lost World, and a very bad one to boot because at least The Lost World was entertaining enough to be considered a worthy follow up to the original Jurassic Park, and had a lead ` Jeff Goulblum' who held his own with the special effects with his great performance.  Poor Sam Neill though not only gets lost with the sub par effects in this film but actually looks like he does not want any part of what is really happening in this movie.

But to tell you the truth, after sitting down, thinking about the REAL plot and after reading the books, it's no wonder Michael Crichton hasn't seen this movie (no lie).This idiot step-dad and his kid go para-sailing next to dino infested island and get stranded after the guy on the boat gets eaten mysteriously off the boat. So the real dad and mom drag Dr, Grant on a 'tour' get stranded (go figure) and spend two hours running for their lives after they find their sun eating 20 year old nestle crunch bars in an old truck for 8 weeks. That just didn't really do well on my list. And then Grant tries to desperately call Saddler off the island and she can't hear anything because Grant is being attacked by the spin, and yet by telepathy or maybe Spielberg called her afterward, she sends the navy air-force or army, but it was ridiculous.So the plot stunk but the scenery was off too.

Steven Spielberg refused to direct, rumors of on-set strife and rewrites, and the inherent risks of being the third part of a series all weighed on its pre-release life.I am happy to say that none of this mattered. Jurassic Park III is an all-out action movie with stellar setpieces, high tempo pacing, and taut direction. It is a 90 minute dino-fest, which is all that I expected from this third installment. It wasn't quite time to move the dinosaurs off the island, and it didn't need the scientific preaching of the earlier two. What it needed were dinosaurs and more dinosaurs.Is the plot standard strand and rescue fare? Yes. We know who will live and who will die from the first time we all the characters. But, the design of the film is amazing. None of the dinosaur sequences are too drawn out, nor do they end too abruptly (like the raptor escape in TLW).The animals are phenomenal. ILM and the rest of the technicians have brought out dinosaurs more real than ever before, and they are a pleasure to watch in and of themselves. The Spinosaurus and the Pteranodon (which is NOT a fake animal) are tremendously well-realized, and the sequences involving them are well worth the price of admission.Overall, the plot is generic, but it is great fun. Was anyone expecting an Oscar caliber movie? No. Was it meant to be an entertaining, loud, bigger, and meaner actioner?

Any longer and the movie would've outgrown what it is, a thrill ride from start to finish. Joe Johnston, who did great work with Jumanji, really takes the movie and runs with it, and one really has to admire the filmmaking. In a world of movie cliches (which the end thankfully doesn't cave into) and drawn out action films trying to be something they aren't, Johnston has trimmed the fat, making JP3 a action-packed machine of a summer popcorn movie, and a movie that leaves you begging for more.

Obviously, when you throw together dinosaurs and humans interacting with each other and chasing each other, you tend to find big audiences young and old. JP3 is no different in its deliverance of non-stop action and is a step in the right direction of the franchise. In the latest installment, we find Téa Leoni and William H. Macy as rich parents looking for their son who wound up on Isla Sorna because of a parasailing accident. Both actors are so much better than the overrated Vince Vaughn and Julianne Moore from ""The Lost World."" The special effects are spectacular, although the story line is a bit rushed at times (the film clocks in at about 90 minutes). Director Joe Johnston has a knack for good popcorn movies. He did wonders with `Honey, I Shrunk the Kids,' `The Rocketeer,' and `Jumanji.' Yet, he does much better with true-life human dramas as he did with `October Sky.'  JP3 has a lot of action, chase sequences and such, but you can't help but feel like it's the popcorn that's filling you up, and not the movie. The editing is a bit choppy in places as it was hard to follow some of the darker chase sequences such as when the Spinosaurus attacks the group on the riverboat. Still, I left the theater feeling much more satisfied than when I saw JP2.

I also saw some other dinos that shouldn't be there! When I first heard of the movie, everyone was saying it was a whole new island with new dinosaurs on it! And I don't get the raptors either. The reason they put the spinosaurus in there is because everyone was getting tired of the T-Rex. But what about the raptors? I think everyone is getting tired of them too! Why couldn't they be replaced with something like Deinonychus. And what is with the makeover they got? Wierd! The first and second movie both focused on herbivores as well as carnivores. Though the carnivores were in there more dinos such as Brachiosaurus, Triceratops, Gallimimus, Stegosaurus, Compsognathus, Parasaurolophus, and pachycephalosaurus got their deserved attention. In the third all you see of herbivores is just them running, and grazing. Yes I know they don't eat meat, but herbivores are still fascinating. And no names are mentioned of them. Okay maybe the Brachiosaurus and Triceratops get a tiny mention in the beginning but apart from that... All in all it was okay, but hopefully the 4th will be a spielsburg creation because a good series is going to waste without hiM! I give this move a 7.

Jurassic Park 3, directed by Joe Johnston, takes the audience a few steps into a new direction. First of all, the third film gives of somewhat of a vibe that reminds us of the first. Two of our favorite characters, Alan Grant and Ellie Sattler, are thrown back into the mix of prehistoric terror. The director does a good job of showing what happened to these people's lives after the events on Isla Nublar. Second, the film returns the original idea of the everyman being hunted by dinosaurs. (As apposed to The Lost World being bombarded by scientists and different experts in the feild.) The third and probably the most powerful factor in the movie is the new dinos in introduces. The new king of the jungle, the Spinosaurus, a dinosaur that barely anyone had heard of until this movie, is the major catalist to much of the adventure. The Pteranodons also offer what I think is one of the greatest adventure moments in one of these movies. A nice touch is also added by expanding on the theory of Raptor intelligce, for once showing the creatures as smart problem solvers, not monsters. To sum up, I give this movie a 8 out of 10 stars. It's better than The Lost World, but nothing could ever live up to the original Jurassic Park. It offers adventure to the max and will leave you satisfied in the end!",Jurassic Park III
696,Chamby_X,Best of the series so far,10,19 August 2001,"Let me say, I love this movie. I think it's the best of the three JP movies. I've read both books, and while the first movie did an ok job of adapting the source material the second didn't even try. The movies went in their own directions, and were fine, but it always bothered me a bit that they strayed from the books in a number of ways. Well, this third movie pretty much takes all the missing pieces from the two books and slaps them together in one amazing dino fest. There aren't any drawn out lectures on why the dinos are and were a bad idea, or anything on extinction. What there are are imaginings of sequences from the books that were not in the last two movies. The pteranadon attack and the raft ride from the first book are adapted, fantastically. The new carnivore, Spinosaurus, is amazing to watch, and you forget that his sudden presence on Isla Sorna isn't explained at all. Personally in movies like that I let those things slide. The characters are as good as they need to be in a movie like this, and the end, which some people think is too abrupt, is fine as far as I'm concerned.

JP3 gets a big thumbs up from me.",Jurassic Park III
698,xshakawtwf,"JPIII is fluffy, but it opens the door for JPIV",8,21 July 2001,"While entertaining, the third installment is, in the end, fluffier than either of the first two. The original is a classic; the second has debatable value, but I personally enjoyed it quite a bit; the third combines elements of the first two with a rather thin plot to create a lighter, somehow comical version of the first film. Yes, they get stuck on the island. Again. Yes, Dinosaurs eat people. In fact, they attack almost at once. The new baddie, Spinosaurus, chomps T-Rex some fifteen or twenty minutes in just so you know the new guy is tough. Then it's run to coast, call for help, fight a few raptors, get attacked by Spinosaurus a few times, play with Pteranodons, etc. Is it enjoyable? Yes, yes it is. Is it entertaining? Yup. Is it intelligent? Well, unlike the first film, this one has no debates over the morality of what was going on, no discussions about what should and shouldn't be done, and no real moral center. So, no, it isn't particularly intelligent. The ending is pretty satisfying, though, and leaves things open for part four, which has potential to be as solid as the first one IF it's done right. There are lines in this film and in the others and in both books that, if used correctly, could build into a well-though-out plot. Let me give you an example: there's a conversation in JPIII that runs something like this: `Spinosaurus? I don't remember that being in InGen's catalogue.' `It wasn't, which makes me wonder what else they were up to.' In the Raptor Room, they find small tanks with baby raptors in them. Long dead, but with wires and electrodes attached to them, as if some strange experiments were being done. So what does this bode for part four? We've got smart raptors, free Pteranodons, odd InGen experiments, and an international incident because the dinos aren't all on the island any more. Plus, Spinosaurus can swim, and I'd say raptors probably could, too. And then, of course, there's Biosyn and Isla Nublar, both ripe with possibilities. There's room for more, BUT please, don't get them stuck on the island again! It's getting old!",Jurassic Park III
699,sweatm,Good sequel with great FX (mild spoilers),6,19 July 2001,"I know that everyone is going to say that this film is not on par with the first film, to which I would quickly agree.  The original JP was a modern film classic, like Jaws, that was not written with the intent of a sequel. So, any attempt at a sequel will appear to fall short.  However, when you look at this film on its own, it is a very enjoyable action film, with plenty of cool dinosaurs to keep audiences wowed.Like the previous two films, this films puts a group of people in the midst of a dinosaur infested island.  However, this installment comes across less preachy than JP2, owing to the fact that Jeff Goldblum (Ian Malcom) is absent from the cast.  Instead, this film focuses more on the dinosaur's social behavior (specifically the raptors).The way the dinosaurs were handled in this film, specifically the raptors, will make dinosaur fans happy.  After the dumbed-down dinos in JP2, it was nice to see intelligent raptors again.The plot of this film is somewhat linear, and predictable in places. This does not interfere with the enjoyment, since the action sequences are incredible, and there is a good amount of comedy worked in.JP3 follows the pattern of previous JP movies when it comes to which dinos to show.  Give the audience some glimpses of the herbivores, but put primarily carnivores on screen.  The aforementioned raptors play a large roll, as does a new JP dino, the spinosaurus.Bottom line: this is a formula movie.  If you are wanting plot twists and a deep message, this movie won't be for you.  But, if you are just wanting a fun summer movie, watch JP3.",Jurassic Park III

Neither was scared, or scarred, to a great extent (my 4 year old had a hand over his face for 2 seconds) and neither came out telling rude jokes (ie...Dr Doolittle).  There was a minimal amount of thoughtfulness, just pure action and thrills geared for younger folk.  This is not a put-down...this is what summer is about.And I can't see the PG-13 rating.  What was the deciding factor?  No vulgar language, the briefest gore, and youngsters only on the edge of their little seats.If you have kids who love adventure and dinosaurs (and they almost all love the latter) see this.

The story is old, the special effects so-so, and incredibly predictable. While the acting is very good, with Sam Niel and William H. Macy giving great performances and Tea Leoni giving a not half-bad one, it does little to make up for the poor storyline and cheesy dialogue.It does have a few good points, such as the new dinosaurs and a few funny scenes and lines.

705,goldfinger59,What the...????,1,29 January 2002,"Just got finished watching it and I have a lot to say.  This movie was downright awful!!!!!  It's like they had in one hand good choices and in the other hand bad choices, like a taste test, and they always picked bad choices.  I'm convinced that this movie was a joke to all who participated in it.  I mean, did the cast READ the script????!!!!  What were there salaries again????!!!  Must have been a lot to make such great actors seem so less-than.First off, the cinematography - what cinematography???  How the heck do you light a movie so badly.  I saw so many chances to make things look, I don't know...SCARY or great or at least interesting that were just passed up with overlighting from unidentified and unmotivated sources that frankly didn't make any sense whatsoever.  Even simple setups like lighting from the SUN was messed up - how hard is that.The script????  Perhaps if they'd spent just a little of the money used in special effects to develop a proper script, I might have been able to stomach the sludge that was pouring from that screen.  Character arcs? Who needs them?  Convincing dialogue that maybe, even vaguely resembles basic human speech and not that random stuff you get when you try to get your computer to say sentences?  How about some storyline, maybe some filler to back up all the plot holes?  And I know it says in the guidelines to refrain from revealing plot elements, but...well you don't have to worry about that here.  I can't reveal what's not there.And I've figured out what they did in editing.  They were charitable and hired this guy who was down on his luck who'd never edited a film before and said, ""here, you put this together"" and they stuck him in a room without even metronome to keep up the pacing with.Some movies are made in sound effects.  This was not.  Cartoonish at best, yes.  This is unforgivable.Anyway, I think I'll keep this movie on my shelf and just relabel it, you know?

Aside from the action the excitement and everything it also introduced the world to the theory that birds were descended from dinosuars. The Lost world introduced nothing except how to cock up a good movie. What a stupid idea to have a dinosuar roaming around a city. Its too godzilla. Jurassic park three however is awesome. it sticks to the tried and tested method of having these creatures on an island and taking the foolish humans to them. The film itself would have got itself a 7 out of 10. the reason that i have given it a ten is because it shows that the T-Rex was a scavenger rather than a predator which is a theory that i agree with totally.,Jurassic Park III

When you go to see a JP movie, you are going to experience excitement both visceral and visual...and this third installment delivers these very well. In fact, it betters the first two installments in that it a) gets right into the story without a lot of ""character-developing"" preamble, b) gives some of its dino characters more intriguing motivation than ""we're REALLY hungry"" and c) dispenses with some of the dry, textbook-like dialogue on unrelated chaos theory and ""they shouldn't'a done this"" debate. Yes, the storyline veers, unstreamlined from one danger to the next, and yes, science is pushed again to the side in favor of bigger dinos who can do more dino-damage and pterosaurs who can fly off with humans who in reality would be twice their own weight.

713,demon2k7,Classic Park III,8,21 July 2001,"Well what is there to say about the next edition of the massive Jurassic Park franchise, well its one of the finest movies to be released this year for a start.Some said that The Lost World (jurassic park II) was Speilberg's worst film, and was not a patch on the first and best film.When Jurassic Park III was announced, fans grew weary of another movie, but hype grew over time and as more and more information came out of the works...the fans became more acquainted with this next instalment.So here we are...the movie has been released but is it good?Answer: VERY!In fact Jurassic Park III is possibly the finest movie released thus far in 2001, finally fans can rejoice in glory as the Park is back...and 10 times bigger and better than ever before.If you are after the most superb and well rendered visuals, or a deep and involving story or maybe an element of romance involved then JP3 is your answer to an almost perfect summer blockbuster.High budget movies these days are often considered to be of lower quality than a lower budget movie...the reason? Well higher budget movies especially summer efforts are consisted of expensive special effects...which is no bad element but offers movie goers a fast action adrenaline pumping movie.There are however one or two movies per summer, with a high budget that will get the must see value...Jurassic Park III is one of them.So what about those special effects then? Well only one word can fully illustrate them and that word is AMAZING.ILM and Digital Domain deliver some of and if not the finest special effects since Buena Vista's Pearl Harbor, who's visuals were also provided by ILM.Speilberg's absence from the directors chair for JP3 was a huge disappointment to fans of the series...however Joe Johnston has done more than a fine job, but rather a near perfect job.He, like Speilberg recognises a unique style and structure that make the whole film flow from danger to happiness to laughter and to fear.If Johnston is not at least nominated for best director at the next Academy Awards then there is something seriously wrong.The musical score for Jurassic Park back in 1993 was one of the finest score ever heard...by John Williams of course.John Williams was reasonably missing from the crew line-up for JP3, he did provide the main theme tunes and extra themes but the new musical composers have done a more than average effort.I would go as far to even say that the music for JP3 is amazing and tremendously satisfying than the first and original movie.The cast line-up for JP3 is also perfect, and the return of Sam Neill and Lara Dern was the missing element from The Lost World.As they say 'the originals are always the best' and the cast for JP3 is the perfect suit for a movie so satisfying and groundbreaking as this.To sum up, Jurassic Park III will definitely go down in the history books in one way or another, it will also be nominated for more than one Academy Award.Putting it bluntly The Lost World is blown away and fans of the original 1993 movie will take to JP3 like no other.The big question that fans are asking is: ""is it better than the first""? My answer to this in all fields is: YES.Go see it now, as it is best viewed on the big screen.",Jurassic Park III
714,benjohnt,Disappointing Monster Movie,6,22 August 2001,"My expectations of this movie were optimistic, since it had, like it's two fore-runners, great production values, and a seemingly competent director. Ten minutes into the movie and an awkwardly scripted scene raised some doubts about the latter point. I could sense we were already being rushed into the dinosaur effects ridden action by the bluntness of the conversation, during which Sam Neill explains to Laura Dern that the dinosaurs are more intelligent than they had previously thought. What a coincidence that this is relevant to the events that happen later. So a boring, inadequate excuse to get Neill to an island full of dinosaurs later, and the action begins.It seemed to me that the main point of this movie is to show some footage of dinosaurs attacking people. There is little reflection on the people affected, as in the first two Jurassic Park films. All we learn about Sam Neill's character (Alan Grant) here is that he would rather study fossils than be chased around an island full of living dinosaurs. Hardly a profound statement about human nature. The only underlying theme here is to address the moral questions and dangers involved in tampering with nature's processes of creating life. Unfortunately, the manner in which it is explored is rather unimaginative (and inconclusive). For example, there are some freakish looking baby dinosaurs in test tubes, who have apparently had some rather unsavoury experiments performed on them. Sound familiar to any other sci-fi fans out there?While a film does not, of course, need to be realistic to be entertaining, this movie is, at times, so unbelievable it seems ridiculous. In particular, the fate of the child lost on the island. And three mercenaries, each armed with rocket launchers, feeling the need to run from two dinosaurs. Half of the plot seems to be based around many of the central characters being incredibly stupid. Stupid enough not to adequately prepare for the eventuality that upon visiting an island full of dinosaurs they might be attacked by some. The effects on the dinosaurs are virtually flawless, as previously in the series. Several new types of dinosaur have been introduced, most noticeably the Pterandons and the Spinosaurus, which is basically a bigger, scarier super predator in the vein of the T-Rex. While these are impressive to watch, there is very little of the suspense that made the previous films in the series so entertaining. The focus here seems to be on providing fast paced, adrenaline-charged action.Unfortunately, none of it really ends conclusively, which left me feeling dissatisfied. There are also some rather misplaced light-hearted moments, that only serve to loosen the tension yet further. Although the mobile phone ring-tone joke is funny.Jurassic Park III feels like an old monster movie, with the Spinosaurus looming throughout the film, the characters being as stupid as they are, and the plot being as scrappy it is. I didn't hate the movie, but after being thoroughly entertained by the older films in the series, I was extremely disappointed by it. 6/10",Jurassic Park III
715,PS Cryer,Plot??? What Plot (spoilers),7,19 July 2001,"If you expect anything intelligent out of this film forget it. The first Jurassic Park was fantastic, good plot, good characters and great dinos, the second film at least had a believable plot even though the ending was terrible but this film has virtually no plot. Basically they get them on the island and have 60mins of dino chases. The new big dino is good but the T-Rex isn't seen much at all, a major disappointment. The Raptors are no where near as cool as in the first two films and are again underused. The best bit is by far the birdcage scenes which are actually quite tense and scary. Oh and the ending, how lame, what a major cop-out, that last scene with the Raptors and then them running to a beach full of marines!!! Please. I just have this terrible feeling that Jurassic Park 4 will follow on the 'birds' escaping and trying to land in habited areas.",Jurassic Park III

I don't know how true that theory on the velociraptors is, but they managed to make it look semi-plausible :) The movie is a little slow to start, but once it finally does, it delivers a good dose of dinosaur action. I found it to be very entertaining minus some elements in the storyline, which made very little sense to me... It might be because I refused to watch the second installment of the JP series, but then again... Allan Grant wasn't in that one so it mustn't be it!

First of all, it is not directed by Steven Speilberg, and it shows.  The film lacks the scare factor produced by the first two (which, although I own both and have seen both at least twenty times each, still scare me).  There is no climax.  Unless perhaps, I fell asleep and missed it, but I highly doubt it, because the plot seemed relatively okay.  The ""climax"" is just another five minute supposed-to-be-scary scene.  Bad.  Finally, the special effects are still extremely wonderful, but this film is trying to exist only on that, and that will not be enough.  Hello?!?  These breathing dinosaurs in the 20 and 21st centuries have been done twice before, do you still expect us to be surprised by it?I give it a 4 out of 10, because it was mildly amusing and there were some times when I caught myself laughing out loud, and it was meant to be a summer blockbuster.

I was so surprised at the spunky little boy who overcame such harsh odds (muffled laughter is surpressed at this remark).   It was a play on Newt from Aliens...who was portrayed more realistically.

721,nicholaspoulos,"The basics of the movie are fine, but it's hurt by tone and editing",5,21 August 2020,"I recently rewatched the whole Jurassic Park series. It's incredibly obvious the main issue in JP3 is not the story, or the Spinosaurus killing the Trex, it's the tone and editing.The story is fine. The writing is acceptable. The animatronics are excellent. The antagonists are mediocre.There are many, many points in the movie where parts that would have been seen as scary in Jurassic Park are flat or played for laughs in JP3. Compare the jump scare of the Velociraptor and Ellie and the scene where she says ""it's trying to come through the glass"", the terror that is felt. That terror is gone in JP3 with the scenes where the skeleton with the parachuter falls out of the tree, the scene where they run from velociraptors in the ruined lab. There are two scenes with woman dangling from a high spot in each movie and only one is scary.But the main point that is a total failure in my opinion on par with Phantom Menace is the Spinosaurus River scene. This scene had the potential to be very very good. There is an excellent Spinosaurus animatronic that When it rises out of the water is one of the best shots in the movie. The entire high point of terror in this scary action scene is intercut with a small child watching Barney the dinosaur. People can't jump from laughing to being scared every two seconds. This scene would have worked much better if they played the entire child sequence first, showing a dropping in hope for the characters, then played the river scene in its entirety until Ellie answers the phone and Grant gives her the information, and then finishing the scene.A minor issue is the two main antagonists. I don't see how they wouldn't be charged with kidnapping or be held responsible for the deaths of the people they hired. That's another problem with trying to make a campy Jurassic Park movie where people get eaten.The best scene is the beginning where the plane attempts to take off and crashes. That was very well done and the only scene that felt as scary as anything in JP1. I just wish they didn't kill off all the mercenaries right away.",Jurassic Park III

A friend of mine got me in to a Private screening because he knew how much of a fan I was of The Jurassic Park films. I was so glad to see it early but now I kind of wish I didn't because this one was really bad. No suspense, no story, and it's not even scary. I was disappointed that Sam Neill (Who Plays Alan Grant) was not in the Lost World, so I was glad to know that he was in the new one. But now after this mess, I hope he had stayed away. There is nothing new about this film that has not already been touch a pond in the last two, and it was too short to boot. It even lacks the charm and heart (Not to mention intelligence) of the last two films. Tea Leoni is just too annoying to watch, and William H Macy Is too good an actor to end up in this crap of a film (the comments he made a few months ago about this film is right on target.). The new dinosaur (Spinosaur) Looks good from a far but closed up, The Spinosaur looks really fake. The raptors are more of a joke than a threat, there is a scent with them that is too stupid to believe, and you end up laughing more than gasping. It makes you wish That Jeff Golbulum was in this film, so he can make fun of it. The Pterodactyls scent is in fact the only decent thing in this disaster of a film. To make a long Story short (and Hopefully save you some money in the process) Don't waste your time. If you want to see a Dinosaur film, rent the first one, or even the second.

Out of the three Jurassic Parks I would have to say that this was even better than The Lost World but still not as good as Jurassic Park. Good Heavens No! And what makes this better than the second one is that it has none of that stupid Chaos Theory as explained by Ian Malcolm. It is also far more action packed than the second one. And probably the first one. Infact why wasn't the first one as action packed as this one. Although I have to admit that when I saw Jurassic Park at the movies in 1993 I missed half of it because I got so scared when someone was killed that I put my hands over my eyes. Well I was only 11 years old then. But what I am saying is that this is one damn good movie. Although it will never be as good as the first one in almost every way possible.

I bet that most people really enjoyed the film, yet they make a bad review for the reasons I said.I will review this movie like a guy who went to see it, not a cynical guy who went to see it:JP3 was better than what I expected. It gives you the most important thing a movie's gotta have, entertainment. Well, since in one way or another we all get influenced by the critics and stuff, (in this case, the stupid belief that a movie with Dinosaurs or any other fantastic animal can't win an Oscartm), don't expect a ""good"" plot... Even though Jurassic Park's one was very solid. Some people say it ain't smart because it's not innovative because there's a small group of humans trapped in an Island infested with Dinosaurs. Well, what did you expect? A depressed clown has to deal with it's interior demons while a nazi priest helps a nurse to cure the people attacked by the dinos?There are the typical born-to-have-a-horrible-death guys, only that this time in a minor proportion than in LW's. There's also the raptors, and the pteras now have way much more time on screen, which is good of course. I don't want to spoil anything else.Fans of the trilogy will be happy to hear and see some of the classic Grant way of being, Neill was like in JP, a great character. There was no bad acting IMHO, Macy, Leoni were good parents. Nivola was a good addition and a ""careable"" character (go and watch some of his movies). Jeter did a good job also, portraying the pathetic Udesky. We could have done it without Morgan, the jungle kid, but he wasn't annoying. I wonder when will we see a T-Rex eating a woman or child. Well, you really get to worry about the people in this movie.I don't know why but I couldn't imagine a JP movie, instead I imagined a Honey, I got trapped in a Dinosaur island kind of movie. Well, mr. Johnston, you really impressed me. The direction was quite effective, it had some nice shots, well used scenes and sequences, etc.The Dinos of course, didn't let me down. They were so realistic, you can see that there has been some progress since the last two movies. The new feathered ones look cool indeed. The S vs T scene was spectacular. The score had the typical songs plus some new ones.Well, to give an end to this boring review, I must say that you gotta see this movie. The chances are that you will like this problem-to-bigger problem movie, it keeps you under suspense the whole time. Too bad it's just 90 minutes long, they should have made it more ""epic"". I bet this is gonna be one of the best of the year.I haven't seen people applauding a movie for years, but they did with this one, as well as I did.",Jurassic Park III

The score of the film is even bad, so bad in fact that It almost destroys what John Williams Did with the first two films.  
I don't know who is worse, The people who made this trash or the people who is defending it. These people Say it's better than Lost World but in reality, it's Not.   The Lost World is Way better than this piece of garbage.  Jurassic Park 3 even Makes Blair Witch 2 looked good.",Jurassic Park III

It really is a totally different take on the original JP franchise.  Instead of the hour of mystical oohs and ahhs and theories on nature and chaos, this film goes straight for the thrills.Sure there's a few cheezy parts...The 12 year old boy who knows how to fend off raptors with smoke bombs and TRex urine after an astonishing two months alone on the island...anyone?And don't get me started on the Grant speaking with the raptors via a magical 'kazoo'...But, the Spinosaurus action was great.

Why would Any body with common sense would even think that this film is any good? This was horrible, a slap in the face of everything the first two movie ever stood for. Even The dinosaurs look embarrass to be in this dino dump. The action is horrible, the acting is extremely bad, and the directing is so off the mark that you end up thinking that it was filmed on some ones video camera. There is no story in this awful movie, and when you get any kind of a story during this mess, it makes no sense. Give and take what you may think of the Lost World, at least it was entertaining, and it had the essence of the first film.

Jurassic Part 3 failed to deliver. I remember waiting for the excitement that I had felt while watching the previous two Jurassic Park films, but it never came. There was no adrenaline rush whatsoever, and the events which took place were quite expected, especially after catching the first two films. It was certainly a disappointment in terms of the plot which seemed quite ludicrous and unreal. One thing which made up slightly for it were the dinosaurs.

William H Macy and Tea Leoni play the parents of a missing child who was stranded on the island where the last film took place(The Lost World). So they trick Alan Grant into going on a rescue mission to find him. That's pretty much the story as a whole and its more and less a standard creature feature but with out the thrills or fun that comes with it. The 4th film in the series (Jurassic World)at least was fun and lived up to its B movie roots while this film does not know what it wants to be.

I for one thought that this was going to be one of those times, and boy I was wrong.  This was just too stupid for words. It's very short compared to the other films of the series, and it definitely lacks the power and the thrills from those two movies. I don't know why but I even did not like Sam Nell in this film, and he was really good in the first one. The story was not up to snuff with the others, and the Dinosaurs were more like brainless killing machines than wild animals. I can suspend disbelieve and just go with the flow, but after two much better films in this series, we deserve better than this.Do yourself a favor and skip it.",Jurassic Park III
736,shortcut10509,"Was not made by Steven Spielberg, and it shows.",1,27 December 2001,"There is really no reason for this movie to have been made. First off, This is not even based on anything written by Michael Crichton and it shows by the lack of any real story or substances. Second, Nether Steven Spielberg or Jeff Goldblum is involved, and it shows by the amateur directing and the lack of depth. Spielberg knew how to spotlight the wonder and power of these wonderful creatures, and Goldblum gave the films it's intelligence and it's heart. Unfortunately, this movie does not benefit from ether of them. And it suffers greatly because of it. Sam Neil Returns as Alan Grant Who is trick this time around into looking for a missing kid who has crashed landed on the Island Sorna (Setting of The Lost World) And instead ends up trap on the island with the parents trying to get off the island. Now this would have worked if there were more to the story than that but unfortunately there is not, and it does not even try to be anything other than that. The whole discussion about The danger of playing god is tossed out for a run in the mill monster movie that has no brains or heart. Sam Neil is a very good actor but his character reminds us on why Jeff Goldblum character is so important to the series. One hint, Goldblum's character had brains, and a sense of humor. Sam Neil's Character has nether. If he did, he would have had the parents of the missing kid checked out before he agreed to go with them on the island. The parents of the missing kid are in fact so dumb, and so annoying that you end up wishing that they would be eaten by the dinosaurs, as for the screen writers and the director of the abomination of a film. There is barely any mention of the first two films, and the story does not even make any lead way into trying to connect it's self to those movies.  It does not even make sense in some aspects of the story, like how the Spinosauris even got on the island in the first place. It was not in The Lost World, so why is it in this one? At The End Of The Lost World, The military was surrounding the island because they did not want the Dinosaurs to go to the mainland, so where aren't they surrounding the island now? All of this and the quality of it make this the most pointless and useless film of this series. It seems like the makers of this film did not even try to make a good film, they just expected people to just swallow it, with out thinking on what they were seeing.  That is a really sad because it taints the magic of the extremely better first two movies.My advice Rent The first Two Films film of this series instead of wasting your time with this one.P.S.

Every Jaws film was worse than the other, and The Jurassic Park series is going through the same pattern. Here is an example:1 A) The Original Jaws: Landmark Film That set the bar in suspends, and sheer thrills. Directed By Steven Spielberg.B) The Original Jurassic Park: Landmark Film That revolutionizes special effects, and combined them superbly with suspends, thrills, and heart. Also Directed By Steven Spielberg.2 A) Jaws 2: A sequel That does not equal the original but manages to keep up the suspends and thrills. This was directed by Jeannot Szwarc, who does not have the flare of Steven Spielberg but manages to keep up the pace set forth by the original.B) The Lost World, Jurassic Park: A sequel that does not equal the original but manages to surpass it in the special effects department. Steven Spielberg directed this, and this is the first time he directed a sequel to one of his original movies. Although It does not come close to the magic of the original, it does retain the superb combination of Suspends, thrills, and heart.3 A) Jaws 3 (also known as Jaws 3D): A bad cash in that is more of a gimmick that an actual movie. The gimmick in question is the rendering of 3D images over bad shark effects that tries to cover up the fact that the story is preposterous, and the acting is outrageously bad. This was Directed by Joe Alves, who proves with out a doubt that anyone with a camera can be a director, but talent is giving to a few.B) Jurassic Park 3: A bad cash In that is more of a gimmick that an actual movie. The gimmicks in question are the discovery of a new dinosaur called the Spinosauris that was hiding from the other films of the series and the evolution of talking raptors. All this and a very short running was clear attempt to cover up the fact that there was really no story to be told, and the fact that acting is so glaringly bad gives a real indication of actors just trying to collect a check. Not even The special effects are up to expectation, and that shocking because it came from the same man who did the others movies in the series. This was directed By Joe Johnson Who previous outings includes Honey I Shrunk the kids and Jumangi were mediocre at best.

It's really not the actors fault, but because the story itself is nothing more of a joke, it's hard not to blame them for their performances. While the special effects are ok for what it is, it's really nothing in comparison to the first two movies. If you want to see a real dinosaur movie, See Jurassic Park.

I feel that this, the 3rd installment, directed by Joe Johnston, does exactly what Spielberg tried to avoid - it portrays the dinosaurs as monsters. This simply kills the movie for me.Also the story is too hollow, and there's a lack of character development. Something that also really annoys me is how unrealistic some of the scenes are. The guy hanging from a tree in a parachute,is first of all still hanging there after 8 weeks even though he definitely isn't out of reach of some of the dinosaurs.

The Special Effects are a few steps behind the last film, and the Spinosauris is able to change shape during different parts of the film.

The actors themselves look like they don't want to be in this film, and the direction of the film look too disjointed to be taken seriously. The screen play feels like it was written by a five year old and judging by the ending of this fluff piece, it looks like the five year old just gave up and went to sleep.The real sad part about all of this is the fact that it's a sequel to two much better movies (Jurassic Park and The Lost World) that had a lot of quality to them.

The bad rip offs of much better movies and the extremely corny, sentimental dialogs only written to please slow adults and small children. This movie was so bad in fact that you don't need Mike and the Bots from MST3K to make fun of it, the movie writes it's own punch lines for you to say. Any movie with Matthew Broderick as an action hero should be an indication on how bad it is, and with a monster that looks more like a raptor than the Godzilla who all know and love, the recipe for failure is pretty big.Which brings us to this film which is not only one of the worse sequels ever made but probably one of the worse films made period. Sam Neil is a great actor, but the film itself is so bad that it makes him look like a buffoon. The way they tried to make him into an Indiana Jones wannabe is not only sad but also flat out laughable. He comes more a cross more like Chevy Chase than Harrison Ford.  The casts of supporting characters fares no better and in some respect fare much worse. William H Macy is probably one of the best actors around but you really can't tell that by his performance here which is beyond annoying.  Tea Leoni is flat out annoying as well as his wife, a woman whose scream could chip years old paint. I think the only actor who fares decent here is the late Michael Jeter, who is barely in the film at all. His performance is funny, and could have benefited the film a lot more if he was in it more.The special effects are not as impressive as they were in the last two films, and the direction is very disjointed compared to what Spielberg was able to do with the first two movies.  Spielberg was able to create tension and create action scenes that can blow your socks off. Joe Johnson, who steps in for Mr. Spielberg this time around not only abandons what his predecessor had done before but completely disregards any logic that the other movies had. The first two films where about science and the dangers of tampering with nature. This film is just a strait forward monster movie that does not even have a plot to go by. The characters here are nothing more than Dinosaur food and the setting itself does not even look like the island of the last movie. There are even certain things in this film that even contradicts some of the information that was giving in the last two films, and it tries to bring in a dinosaur that was not even created in those movies.Its really sad to see Joe Johnson demean himself with a bad film like this, because he has done much better work in the past.  The Rocketter is a prime example of a good comic book movie, and October Sky is a well-paced family drama that should have had more notice in the theater. With this movie, Joe looks like he just wanted to cash a pay check, and judging by the way every thing in the film was done, it looks like every one involved were doing the same thing.

Okay, so it's still just popcorn fare, and the novelty of realistic looking dinosaurs has worn thin since 1993, but director Joe Johnston (a protégé of George Lucas) brings more rhythm and showmanship to Jurassic Park III than either of Spielberg's previous two efforts. The Michael Crichton screenplay is cleverer which is a good thing since I always felt the previous movies were just too simplistic in their approach to the concept. Jeff Goldbloom and Richard Attenborough are both absent from this movie which makes room for William H Macy and Tea Leoni. Although Jeff and Dickie are two fine actors, Macy and Leoni are interesting as the warring couple bringing a much needed human element to the CG dino fest. Recommended.",Jurassic Park III

The plot was extremely hollow, and a majority of the acting was less than stellar. However, I won't deny that I enjoyed the 90+ minutes I spent sitting through this film. There was everything to expect in the typical JP movie: victims with awfully good endurance, a jungle, and some scary dinosaurs.Truthfully, it felt as if I were watching a different sequel to the original, not a second. The premise was pretty much the same: a survivor of the Jurassic Park incident is forced to return to the island, and when all communication is cut by unfortunate circumstances, it's time to run around like crazy, trying to find a way off the island while escaping vicious dinosaurs at the same time. This time, we get to watch Sam Neill squirm instead of Jeff Goldblum, and instead of doing research, they're looking for a twelve-year-old kid. Not exactly the smartest move, but all is forgiven and forgotten when the dinosaurs are unleashed once more.If you're expecting something original and spectacular, then you're going to be disappointed.

When it comes to this series the last one is defiantly my favorite. Jurassic park III is one of my favorite movies of all time. Once again Jurassic Park brings back deadly velociraptors and even though Jurassic Park always messes up the size of the Velociraptor they are still as awesome as ever. One thing I don't get is why an adult would take a child any where near an island with ferocious and supposed to be extinct creatures. Some body might say the adult didn't know, but then how did the kids mother and father know to contact Dr. Grant. That was never explained. Also I didn't think that the T-Rex should have been killed off. In the end I forgave all the flaws because of that brilliant twist at the end. I really thought that Billy was gone. Any way, a while ago I was looking for maybe another Jurassic Park and I came across something that said another sequel was coming out in 2012, well now it's 2014 and it says its coming out in 2015.

Jurassic Park 3 was made from scratch, and it really does show. While the movie isn't bad per say, it could have done many things better. The story is poor and rushed, the character's are annoying and forgettable, and most of all it just feels phoned in.

755,nemesis-7,"Very, very entertaining, ending is just a little lame!",9,5 August 2001,I saw this movie twice thats how much I like the JP series. Only thing I was dissapointed in was the ending. It wasn't bad but there could have been the now classic dinosaur ending and there wasn't one. Would have been cool to see a confrontation between the marines and Spinosauras in the end. Maybe it would have raised the level of violence though. If they make one more I hope they either go to the first island or at least explain in movie timelines why they haven't needed to visit he dinos on the island.Anyway like I said its very entertaining and I recommend it to families. My kids loved it.Gary,Jurassic Park III

From the moment they step on the island until the end, there are but a few scenes that aren't action packed.  After the let down of Jurassic 2, I was a bit skeptical, but the movie has more than made up for the producer's errors.  If you are a fan of the original than you'll love this one.

760,BJWuotila,A parody of the first film,4,20 July 2001,"Jurassic Park III is Joe Johnston's term paper on the Jurassic Park saga. He scavenges both the book and movie versions of Jurassic Park and the Lost World and attempts to piece together an intelligible work to submit to Professor Spielberg.  Unfortunately, Johnston's interest in the subject matter is obviously limited to box office profits. It would be nice to see a film that was bold enough to portray dinosaurs as the awe-inspiring, radically unique creatures of yestereon that made my childhood visits to the museum so exciting (Disney's Animated Dinosaur does not count).  Instead, JP III surrenders to the terrible lizard image by portraying the dinos once again as ever-hungry disaster machines.  And the plot is so tiring.  How many times can Hollywood writers get a bunch of people on an island to get eaten by dinosaurs?  Oops, was that a spoiler?  With the attention to detail afforded to this film, that is about as close as you get to a spoiler. Even the special effects that were synonymous with the first film are laughable in this installment.  The only potentially visually intriguing scene in the entire movie was plagued by dinos that seemed to have been constructed at Jim Henson's Creature Shop.  And don't count on Sam Neill or William H. Macy to save the day (even though they most certainly do on Isla Sorna). Neill's once firm Dr. Grant is now goofy and stumbling.  Macy might have been good, had he not been paired with Tea Leoni.  Leoni is most certainly eye candy, which may be why she was cast, but she is very unconvincing as Macy's on-screen wife.  The couple is creepy at best.  Alessandro Nivola's is predictable playing the generic Billy Brennan who seems to be Dr. Grant's understudy/adopted child.  And last, but definitely least, Laura Dern makes a small appearance to explain why she isn't in most of the movie and to remind us it is better to stay at home than to get eaten by dinosaurs.  The only oddly suspenseful aspect of the movie was that I never knew who was going to die next, simply because any of them could have died and it wouldn't have made the slightest bit of difference.  GO DINOSAURS!!",Jurassic Park III

I can't believe that the last (hopefully) of this trilogy was so bad. it fits in with the other great trilogy disappointment, Godfather III. The only reason this movie should be seen is for the amazing graphics. I was surprised when the movie ended and the crowd started clapping. I joined in because of my joy that it was finally over. In front of the theater i heard some people talking about 50% of the people there enjoyed it. Two of the scenes in the movie are almost exactly the same as scenes from the first and second Jurassic Park. And horrible unrealistic ending even made the movie worse. At certain parts most of the theater broke out in quiet laughter (these parts were obviously not meant to be funny).My final thought: if you want to see a comedy, forget about scary movie 2, go see Jurassic Park 3 the (hopefully) final movie that even makes the lost world seem like a masterpiece.",Jurassic Park III

I am a fan of the original two, but I was disappointed by The Lost World. I feel that JP3 surpassed the second one with visuals, action sequences, and intensity. This final movie even though was not directed by Spielberg it did still have his feel in it. The dialogue was kind of bland but was made up for by all the intense action sequences. I was on the edge of my seat from the beginning and felt the new dinosaur introduced in the movie was more terrifying than the raptor or trex from the first two. This one was a little more gory and raw compared to the first two. I would recommend this to fans of the first two movies and anyone who loves dinosaurs this movie will not disappoint. I would think twice before taking small children to see it though with a lot of the violence in the movie and ""feeding"" scenes.",Jurassic Park III

They could done so much more, like marine dinosaurs and such. My little girl loved it, she loves anything with dinosaurs in it. This reminds me of Blair Witch II, a complete waste of time, and moreover, a slap in the face to the ingenuity of the original. Hollywood, please, we are intelligent enough to know when you are merely trying to milk the last few dollars out of our pockets. You are capable of great movies that are worth our time and money. Please stop making sequels that are just for the sake of making a few extra bucks.",Jurassic Park III
767,rooster752,"Dinos Return in Cheesy, yet exciting movie",7,19 July 2001,"Jurassic Park 3 falls somewhere in between the fantastic Jurassica Park , and the dismal Lost World.  The plot is at a minimal (Boy gest lost on island.  Parents go with rescue team.  Survivors try to get off the island), but it gets the job done.  The acting is good enough for the most part, and Sam Neil does a fine job as Dr. Grant.  More importantly, the real stars of this movie, the dinosaurs, return and look fantastic.  The film is very fast-paced, and no time is wasted jumping into the action.  After only a few minutes, everyone is on the island, running away from dinos.  This is obviously quite different from the way Jurassic Park 1 opened, but this is the third film in the franchise, and the plotline about the dinosaur park has already been established.  The audience came to see dinos, and dinos they saw. The thing that really bogs the film down is the lack of continuity it has with the previous ones.  Dinosaurs look completely different from the way they did in the first film (Raptors are now purple...Brachiosaurus are sorta spotted..)  Also, one of the big, albeit cheesy plot points is that Grant has discovered through fossils that Raptors were smarter than they had ever imagined.  So, the raptors in JP3 are now really smart, which is really frustrating to watch because they weren't anywhere near as intelligent in the first film.  Also, Grant discovered that Raptors can communicate, so right on cue, the raptors in this film talk to each other, which they obviously didn't do in the first film. But, I suppose those are just a few minor problems.  The biggest problem of the film is its abrupt ending, which comes out of nowhere.  The audience never really got an epic finale, as the movie just ended in an incredibly hokey way after one of its action sequences. Overall, the film is very entertaining to watch and downright creepy in some spots.  What it lacks in intelligence it makes up in excitement.",Jurassic Park III
768,obarker,I was VERY pleased with this movie!!!,10,22 July 2001,"Jurassic Park 3
Review by Joshua barkera.k.a. mr. Goodbytes.Let me just start by saying, I was VERY pleased with this movie.People that don't like this movie have a serious screw loose. It has great acting, and it gets to the point fast. The movie timing is perfect, it runs very smoothly. I don't understand why people complained about the length. It has a great mix of dinosaurs. Less deaths, which actually makes for a more suspenseful movie. You don't say `Oh, this one is going to die.' You actually FEEL for these characters. The effects are fantastic. In fact, there were only 3 small scenes that you could tell the difference between CGI and Animatronic. Sure, it doesn't have a thick plot, but the only reason JP had a plot is because it had a book to base it off of. LW tried to have a plot independent of its book, but failed. Jp3 is EXACTLY what the JP series needs. The comedy was FAR from corny like a lot of `critics' have said.I also don't understand how people think it is stupid to have dinosaurs just for the sake of showing them, but I disagree. After all, what do you think the Parasaurolophus mixed in with the Brachiosaurs were for in the original JP. Let's not forget the Gallimimus and baby Triceratops in LW. JP movies are ABOUT DINOSAURS PEOPLE!!!! Now, let's discuss the fight. This is my ONLY complaint. I think it should have lasted a little longer. The ending was fine, a lot better than the ending that was cut in my opinion. This is a great Thrill ride of a movie. I will go see it again. This is Mr. Goodbytes Signing off.  My Verdict,4 out of 4 stars",Jurassic Park III

The movie was fine in a sort of harmless, unsurprising way. It had a plot, sort of, that was intelligible. The characters were thin, but not entirely unappealing. After the horrid ""Cats and Dogs"" and the catastrophic ""Final Fantasy,"" JP III was a welcome return to mediocrity -- comfortable, entertaining, competent mediocrity. What's so bad about that??",Jurassic Park III
770,jwtaylor-2,"Summer Fun, Finally!",10,18 July 2001,"To me summer movies are supposed to be fun, exciting thrill rides that make going to the movies fun. Jurassic Park 3 is just that.  No it's not the best film ever made, but it is one of those films that you can sit down and watch and enjoy while munching on your popcorn.  Some people may take pop shots at the film, but it is well worth the price if you want to have some fun. Don't go into it expecting to see an epic film, go into it expecting to see the movie for what it is, a fun summer movie.",Jurassic Park III
771,mats1822,yet another plotless novelty (contains spoilers),7,25 July 2001,"hollywood, it seems, has a severe aversion to films that actually have a viable point, and this film is no different.although i give JP3 props for being MUCH better than the monstrocity (aka ""the lost world""), it still falls miles short of the original.  This, however comes as no surprise to anyone.On the surface, JP3 has some enticing perks effects-wise.  I heard rumors of a Spinosaurus/T-Rex rumble and was instantly intrigued.  The movie even seemed to be coherent plotwise at first....... Then i went and saw it the day it came out.From a truly entertaining perspective, the movie was appreciable. Dinosaurs, attacks, and action scenes were quite impressive as expected. The Pterodactyl segments were my personal favorites, both because they were amusing and flowed well.  Unfortunately, the aforementioned rumble was rather disappointing in my opinion due to brevity and simplicity.  I mean, T-Rex, king of the dinos, getting usurped by a new, bigger, badder beast, should last more than the 25 seconds and 2-3 charges that it was composed of.  It's a freakin' clash of the titans moment.Overall, the technical aspects of the movie were amazing,and although some of the editing was a little jumpy, it fit into the frenzied atmosphere of Isla Sorna.The major downfall had to be the *ahem* plot (or lack thereof). Convaluted attempts to connect it to its predecessors (e.g. Elie & co.)  lead to dead ends.  The post-marriage conflicts and resolutions of William H. Macy and Tea Leoni (what are THEY doing in this movie, anyway?) in the middle of intermittent Spinosaurus and Raptor assaults are basically space-fillers. It made me miss events that happen for a REASON (e.g. having to reboot power systems, electric fences, phones).  It was sad that Laura Dern became a little spot part in a scattered plot that revolved around a little family spat that i would expect from a generic Julia Roberts-esque flick.  It's really a shame that none of the characters ever gets much depth...But at least a few people die, right?  Watching this movie was fun, but painful at the same time.  Spielberg could have at least directed it and put it off til after A.I.  That way he could have atoned for The Lost World . I just wish sequels these days had a purpose other than to pull revenue on the drawing power of a previous work.  I guess that's just wishful thinking.At least the big Marine/Army invasion thing at the end was unexpected. Too bad they didn't get a chance to rip into the renegade 'saurs (a la Aliens).JP3 might have been cool if it wasn't driven by bloodlust and carnage that never really put up (see: low death count).I gave it a 6 out of 10 for its excellent effects, pure entertainment value and decent camera-work, and its superiority to the other forgettable sequel.",Jurassic Park III
772,awfmail,JP3 Lacks Originality,1,25 September 2003,"Jurassic Park III is an example of an excuse to make a Jurassic Park film for money without any thought or care in the development of the plot.The original Jurassic Park had originality, it had a LOT of interesting SCIENCE fiction elements incorporated into it. The next JP film needs more SCIENCE in it to support its fictional elements; this was the genious of the original JP, and it is what gave the film credibility. Michael Crichton is a genious, but the writers of JP3 could not write their way out of a paper bag. Some of those lines made me flinch they were so bad (i.e., ""I dare them [pterodayctls] to nest in Enid, Oklahoma"").  The worst part of JP3: William Macy.  Macy deserves an academy award for the most number of stupid faces made by an actor in 90 minutes. As Malcom would say about Jurassic Park III: ""They packaged it, slapped a [Universal] seal on it, and now they want to sell it, they want to sell it!""  I was a HUGE fan of the original JP films, and I watched the original JP mutiple times. I would like to see a JP4 with a REAL plot on a HIGHER intellectual level.",Jurassic Park III
773,humblebee2000,"Not bad, but not great either...",7,20 July 2001,"Okay, I loved the first one.  And I liked parts of the second one.  But it's definitely gotten a little formulaic.1.  People loose in dino-land (obvious) 2.  Kids are the heroes (Hammond's granddaughter, Malcolm's daughter (step?), little Kirby) 3.  New dino each movie (all new the first, stegos & pachys the second, Spinosaurus & ankylos the third) 4.  Family theme each movie - Hammond's grandkids and the Ellie/Grant debate, Malcolm's little PC family, the Kirbys 5.  Baby dinos each movie - raptor, t-rex, pteros & raptor eggs 6.  Funny moments - the stuffed dinos, the godzilla theme, the satellite phone 7.  Exploiters vs. Preservers (although in the third movie the debate is toned down to ""touching"" vs. ""watching"")Needless to say, there are more.The dinos are great, although the hyped fight of Spinosaur vs. T-Rex was too short.  But there are problems.1.  When the plane falls to the ground, it looks like it's a lot further than 16 feet (the height of the spinosaur)2.  In the water, the spino is standing up with what appears to be only its feet in the water (at the crane), but the dino was just seen swimming toward the boat, which can't be in water much deeper than the crane!  While the homage to Jaws is nice, could it be a little more realistic?  The difference in water depth is too exaggerated in too small a distance, to my understanding.3.  If the raptors are so intelligent in this movie (talking to each other, communicating, etc., basically acting like primitive humans) then why did the female in the first kill all but two of the others?  Bad PMS day? Cowing others into submission would be a better way than killing them, doncha think?4.  How did Kirby know Billy's name?  I was expecting a ""well, I met this guy earlier"" scene (probably on the cutting floor) where Billy explained to Grant who Kirby was.  Nope.5.  The T-Rex didn't have to chase the humans too far to run into the Spino's territory (unless the Spino just looks to kill T-Rexs (hinted at here, but that DOES NOT fit the Spino's characteristics as understood today)) so any notion of territoriality of predators is kinda quashed.Three were good points though.1.  The raptors. 2.  The ankylos (one of my fave dinos). 3.  The sat phone. 4.  The aerie (from the original story, good use of a lost piece). 5.  The student aspect (taken from the second book, but reworked). 6.  Dissing Malcolm (who should've died in the first movie, but Spielberg changed it) 7.  No John Hammond (also should've died in the first movie, again thank Spielberg). 8.  The nice resolution of Ellie & Grant's debate on kids (although they shouldn't've had a relationship, again thank Spielberg)Better than the second, could've been better than the first if they tried. Why can't we have a GOOD quality dino film that's realistic? I'm waiting for ""Raptor Red"" to be made into a movie.",Jurassic Park III
774,dmj23,Pure Crap,2,17 July 2001,"Dinosaurs are one of those creatures that are just made to be in movies...the problem is that we insist on having people for them to eat.  If I had my way, all the people would be taken out of this horrific third installment that goes even deeper into the bowels of movie-dome than the second one.  The plot (roughly:  Grant gets suckered onto island, plane crashes, grant gets off of island...raptors can talk) is presented with no more finesse than a list of short sketches. The movie had more promise than I think most of the Jurassic Park movies.  Special effects had advanced to a point where created Dinosaurs was no longer a major budgetary outlay, and much more is known about cloning.  Yet all of those avenues where left un-explored.  Grant wonders at one point ""makes you wonder what else In-Gen was doing here.""  Yeah it does kind of make you wonder...too bad you'll never find out because we're too busy inserted cheesy dialogue into this already predictable movie. It seems that every line a character utters is another ""No, this is what happens when you play god"", ""You're no better than the people who made this Island,"" or the ever popular, ""Run!!"" and ""I'll be here waiting for you. And those of you who don't care about plot, and characters and are perfectly happy to witness dinosaurs, well...it's only a little over an hour and none of the money shots are particularly exciting.  Mediocre at best.  Plus the movie blows its wad way too early with the T-Rex, Spinosouraus (does this even exist?) battle scene.  Leaving the rest of the movie with a dry anti-climatic empty feeling. There is only one type of person that I would recommend this movie for.  Someone who watches a lot of soap operas and has ADD.  A soap opera fan will probably find the plot perfectly ok, and only someone on ADD will appreciate the rate at which this movie climaxes.

Another good new aspect, is the scene with all the flying dinosaurs which i always thought they should have done before and was very jumpy. However, I wasn't entirely happy about the velociraptors evolving smarter which was a bit ridiculous.This film will never match up to the first film, but improves the quality of the Jurassic park series after the dismal second film.

779,orcalab,Change Of Heart,10,24 July 2001,"I wrote my opinion before, and now since i have seen it again, i have had a change of heart, I thought this film was so much better than what my first opinions were, It is much much better than the second film, Sam Niell was good as always, Alessandro Nivola (one of my two favorite actors) was great in this movie, and the other actors were good also, take for example, Trevor Morgan has gone a long way since his Barney days.  The effects were very amazing, and awe stunning ( warning, may be too much for the younger children this time around though)  this movie is honestly for the people a little older and who can handle the intense and dazzling effects.  The plot wasn't bad, there was just not too much depth thats all, that doesn't mean it sucked.  This film is not Jurassic Park, but it is most likely the closest that we are going to get to it again though.  I liked this movie a lot.  I gave it two thumbs up, and so did everyone else I saw it with, the first time (out of the two times I've seen it) the film got an applause, never got that at the second film.  I liked it and i am very excited to get it on DVD right away.  I will say though, that this was a surprise, but this is the best that they are going to do, if there is a fourth, they are going to have to work very very hard to top this one off, and it will be impossible to top Jurassic Park off.  One thing that may help if they would have to make a fourth, would be to keep some of the original actors from either the first, or the third, and then add a few (smart)new comers, but if there wouldn't be some people that you love from the 1st or 3rd, then there may not be anything that you will want to go back to.

If you like dinosaurs at ALL, even just a little bit, you will love this installment in the Jurassic Park saga!  The actors were all excellent and believable.  The real stars this time, again, were the dinosaurs. The scenes with the raptors were top notch! I have a few wishes for the film though which could only add to its greatness in very small ways:  Could have been a little longer,  could have seen the stunning Laura Dern more,  more scenes with the spinosaurus.

I have seen a lot of movies, and when I say a lot that's exactly what i mean. I have never seen a more suspenseful moment in all of those films than the simple thumping of the approaching T-Rex and the soft rippleing of the water in the glass...what made this scene so suspenseful you may ask? The simplicity. You know it's coming and the charactors know it too. In the third film, the director (Joe Johnson) relied far too much on dinosaurs jumping out to startle the audience. Now these moments are good and all, but the sad part is that out of all of the moments like this in JP3 the one that made me jump the highest was a suspended bridge falling apart.If your going to make a sequel you cannot stray too far from the original. This movie looked different, and acted different, and quite frankly, that p***es me off! In the first two, the raptors were smart, very smart, but in this one they've become smartyer than the humans, and the audience. The movie dragged on ridiculously for the last hour, and the opening scene was so pathetic i almost broke out laughing! It was predictable, and there was far too much comic relief. Now, who was the favorite charactor of the first two films? not Alan Grant, or Ian Malcolm...it was the Rex, who was smart and chose not to take a starring role in such an obscure picture. It showed up for 2 minutes...sweriously...then it was killed by this all powerful spinosaurus...which by the way, if Ingen had really made such a super predator, why wasn't it mentioned in either of the previous films?!? The facts are clear...Spielbergs movies were so honest, and simple. Johnsons film relied on cheesy lines and poor effects.

783,DentedZ24,Certainly worth a look... (VERY small spoiler near end),7,19 July 2001,"OK, I went to see the movie at the local theatre yesterday, and while it may not live up to the original this film was by no means boring or bad. The beginning may be somewhat boring, but that's what you should have come to expect from this trilogy. The movie is shorter in length than the first two; not necessarily a bad thing by any stretch. This actually forced less boring stoppages of dialogue and more dinosaur encounters. Because let's face it, if your going to an action movie expecting lots of dialogue and story developing most of the time you will be sorely disappointed. It was nice to see the introduction of 3 new dinosaurs that were unseen in the past: Spinosaurus, Pteranodon, and Ankylosaurus (wasn't named in the film, the one that looks like a tank). There were times when you could tell that some of dinosaurs were computer generated, but for the most part they seemed ""real."" The only thing that really bothered me was its very abrupt ending. Kind of let me down. I'd say even 10 more minutes of leading to the ending would have made it much better. Most of the different action scenes were very thrilling, I personally liked the Ptranodon scene best of all, which is no surprise when you consider Johnston's skills in making good scenes involving flight. One more thing I want to touch upon before I finish, and this contains a small spoiler about the number of people that die. I've seen people complain that not enough people die, but I think these people may have just been spoiled by Lost World. Many people died in that one in various scenes, but that was also due to dinosaurs interacting with more people. In the first Jurassic Park, 5 people died. In JP3 4 died.Overall, I'd just like advise you to check this movie out at least once. If the only reasons you are going is for gore, people's deaths, and dialogue you will be disappointed from in those aspects. But I'm sure you will love the major action sequences and the faster pace of this movie than its predecessors. It's worth a look.",Jurassic Park III
784,KITHFan22,A great trilogy,10,19 July 2001,"Being a huge fan of 1 and 2, needless to say, I was excited about Jurassic Park III. I've been excited about this for months, and finally seeing it opening night just topped off my summer. Sam Neill, William H Macy and Tea Leoni gave excellent performances, as well as the supporting cast.A huge fan of William Macy, I was determined to like the movie no matter what, but I didn't need an excuse to love it, it was great no matter what. A definite must-see!",Jurassic Park III
785,rick_gateley,Not as brilliant as the first...,3,29 July 2001,"Jurassic Park 3 lacked the sort of plot that the first two did. In fact I think that it was way too short.

The thing that makes this movie stand miles above Jurassic Park 2: The Lost World is that above all else, the movie itself seems to realize it is a shallow concept, but still tells the story in a very enjoyable way. The shots of the dinosaurs fighting each other was awesome, by far the best CGI creatures seen as yet (it may be just me, but when the T-rex is killed, I felt it was as though it were to slam the over-use of T-rex's in JP2).  If you haven't seen this movie, do so, but see it as you would watch a sporting event. Go with a friend, and one person root for the dinosaurs, and the other root for the people.Will there be a Jurassic Park 4? if they do so, I would hope it would be more like an Aliens style movie,",Jurassic Park III
787,disxz,A mix of good and bad with a lot of bad,7,4 July 2006,"A lot of people claim that JP-3 is better than JP-2 but that's just rubbish. If have'nt watched this movie already and want to, you'd better see it with an open mind. If you expect something on the lines of JP-1 and JP-2, you're gonna puke. The story is mostly nonexistent and the acting is mostly crap. However, the environs are pretty nice and atmospheric and there are a few good moments. However, the seriousness has been kicked with a lot of comical elements thrown and extremely and utterly stupid moves like making the Velociraptors talk! CGI wherver used, looks utterly fake and crap. CGI should have been kept minimal. After JP-1 and 2, its totally unbelievable to see fake CGI dinos being used. Watch this movie for pure entertainment but no great appreciation.",Jurassic Park III
788,zpo1,And I thought the second one was bad,4,18 July 2001,"Whoa, what a bad movie. This just goes over the lines of stupidity. Script was horrible and it just tells you that it was written by someone who did not even care about good Jurassic Park idea. Special effects were ok, nothing great.  I just don't understand why would anyone produce such a bad movie.  Lame action and bad dialogue just blew it. If you like Jurassic park don't see this movie. It's a waste of 90 minutes, go see something else, something more intelligent.  This movie is for people who don't care about good story. If you are smart, go see something else.",Jurassic Park III
789,DevMac,Worse than the second,2,20 July 2001,"JP3 fell far short of the second and is not even in the same ballpark as the first. The movie lacked the magic that the first movie had, it lacked imagination, a good story, and good actors.  I think Sam Neil was just looking for another cash in but his acting in this movie is his obvious low. An unbelievable story and some bad acting make this movie a rental at best.",Jurassic Park III
790,damndirtyape182,film + raptor = PERFECT (well nearly),9,30 August 2001,"*** SPOILERS ***As one of the biggest fans of the JP series I have been awaiting this film for at least a year (probally since 26th May 1997) and after 2 less than impressive theatrical trailers I finally got around to seeing this film despite the hype being far less than it was for the previous sequel.So was it worth the wait? DEFINITELY.The film moves at a brilliant pace and with the exception of 2 scenes in particular the film is a perfect example of how this type of film should be made, the long awaited Pterodon scene has been adapted from the ""token flying dinosaur scene"" that appeared in the first book, into on of the most thrilling scenes filmed, one that easily rivals the trailer sequence from Lost World.Top marks also go to the very welcome new dino, the Spinosaurus, the idea of a constant nemesis who turns up at the worst possible moments kept me on the edge throughout the whole film with the cell phone dial becoming as dark and ominous as the JAWS theme (see the film, you'll know what I mean). The scene with the emergency take off is absoulutely thrilling with an amazing first glimpse of the spino.As for the raptors, they please as always, the scene with the raptor head in the glass tank is brilliant and it's nice to finally see some real good running shots of them (no long grass here this time).So what stops it getting a ten, 2 things, first the ending was far to abrupt (compared to Lost World's) which is a shame because it had potential (driving the spino back at the last moment with gunfire as it bursts from the trees and destroys a chopper, now that would look cool).The other problem is the ""Talking Raptor Dream Sequence"", like the ending this may have looked good on paper but unfortunately it didn't translate well onto the screen and is the only part of the film that doesn't suit the tone of the JP films.Apart from that the film is a brilliant action thriller and with its combo of great acting, brilliant effects and cool dinos, JP3 is a welcome addition to the JP series.Bring on part 4",Jurassic Park III
791,sammybc26,wasted time,4,22 July 2001,"this was a huge letdown.  i convinced myself with the readdition of sam neil that this movie would be excellent like the first.  instead i was left with a movie that went nowhere and was obviously made just to show off technology and to make more money for the company.  the fact that they are considering a fourth installment is ridiculous.  the characters were all lame this time around.  william h macy and sam neil are all wasted talent in this movie. my main objection with the movie is where is the big finale with the spinosaures.  nothing even remotely close to a big war happened.  it just ended leaving me so unsatisfied.  with a huge deal being made about the spinosaures, i thought they would make this thing a vicious bad-ass but in the end it was a dinosaur that ran and that was it.  i say no to another jurassic park.  some movies just dont need anymore sequals",Jurassic Park III

Not only was the story weak, dialogue over dramatic and badly cast, its not worth seeing it for $7-$10!  Wait for this movie on to go on rent or watch it on tv.  I think the filmmakers tried to bank too much on the success of the first jurassic, but in my opinion they should have stopped there.  This installment was just another studio's bad-attempt at trying to top the first two (although the second one was bad as it is).  So, instead go see Shrek for the third time or better yet, stay home.. Save the gas money, the overly priced tickets, and the $4 popcorn! Thank god I didnt have to pay for this one...which seems to be a trend lately, what is wrong with hollywood?!",Jurassic Park III

You could also say what was the point of me seeing that movie, at least it was a cheapie night.The plot itself is really ridiculous and the acting about the same, except maybe for Sam Neill who is not bad in his character. It would have made a nice tv movie but that's about it.  There is no really original or exciting moments in the film, and not a lot a scary parts.  The only time i jumped is when one of the character stepped on a staircase and almost fell.The special fx are ok but nothing ground breaking.  And what is this... talking raptors??!!  Next thing we'll see is a movie about talking apes.... (oops!)The movie may be fine for kids or teenagers( i'm sure McDonalds will sell a lot of happy meals), but if you want a minimum of a good time, avoid this one, go see shrek for a second time.",Jurassic Park III

Jurassic Park III is a great movie! Nothing can compare to the first film, but JPIII is very close behind.[Potential Spoilers] I loved the parasail island arrival sequence in the beginning. It was so nice to see a lot of the island. I love the scene where the group finds the video camera and plays it back and sees Eric on the screen! [End of Spoilers]I was wondering if I would feel it would be too short at the end when I finished seeing it. Nope! It was the perfect length, and I think JPIII seemed to be longer than it was. It is in my top 5 favorite movies of all time, but not the 1st favorite: that goes to JP1. If you haven't seen JPIII yet because you are debating if it is good or not, I cannot stress enough, ""Go!""

796,mgoldstein,Another typical predictable movie,2,28 July 2001,"Well, another sequel, with less ideas, a little bit improved CG and some blood to scare children. There isn't much to it, unfortunately. In the first 10 minutes of the movie you know what is going to happen until the end of it. But there is one good thing, why I didn't give it a 1, the end comes quickly, so you don't have to suffer too much in front of it. That's just my impression about this movie. I know of people that liked it, but I really prefer unpredictability.

797,Omen III,I can't believe that people liked it,1,9 February 2002,"The first movie was great - I think we can all agree on that. The second one was much less; mostly because of the ending - but the third one is crap from beginning to end. There is no story only a storyline with more holes than Swiss cheese. But fair enough, these movies don't really need a strong movie - they live on the special effects. But once you saw a dinosaur, the magic ain't there anymore. And that deltaflying scene at the beginning.... cheap, very cheap. The ending is worse than the second movie, the humour is still there but very lame, and no suspense. I don't need a part 4 anymore.

It is well worth seeing.  The dinosaur graphics are amazing!!  The ending was weird to me because it kinda left you hanging.  I guess there could be a Jurassic IV. All and all it was a great movie.  There aren't too many movies I would pay to see twice, but this would qualify.  This movies for you if you're a sci-fi lover.",Jurassic Park III
799,Terminator_M_101,Just read my comments.,10,18 July 2001,"This movie was very good I thought.  Well....the plot actually was kind of uh...well, wasn't much of one really.  The beginning kind of threw you into the story way too quickly rather than letting you get to know the characters more, which isn't a bad thing, just different.  And the ending was kind of like a ""Lord Of The Flies"" ending, it leaves you wondering: what the hell, did I miss something?  The dinosaurs were very well done though with a lot of new and cool ones and the movie always kept you awake.  Very good action sequences, but could have had a little more help with the storyline. Still, 10 out of 10.",Jurassic Park III

I thought at least the dinosaurs would be cool but they really weren't. The Raptors were promoted as being so intelligent, but they really didn't show it all that much. I thought it was great how Steven Speilberg pulled off directing like Stanley Kubrick in ""A.I"" this summer but Joe Johnston trying to direct like Steven Speilberg was not good for this film at all. I still think that the original Jurassic Park had a fine plot, great suspense action, not great acting but who needs it when the dinosaurs were amazing enough. The two sequels are just begging the viewers for more money and not giving us good entertainment for our dollar, the sad thing is that hhahaha if they make another sequel, I will probably go see it! Go figure! Peace",Jurassic Park III
801,GGreene,An Episode of Super-Survivor,3,16 July 2001,"Some day people will appreciate what a director of Spielberg's magnitude brings to movies. This one is only a superior version of Lake Placid. There's no substance to the story (it's not written by Spielberg and David Koepp as the first two were); it lacks moral purpose (there's only a single line on cloning or genetic engineering) so there's no science in the fiction, and without the character of Malcolm it's almost completely humorless. Also, these dinosaurs, rather than behaving like natural creatures and dangerous predators, have evolved into unrecognizably thinking monsters that carry out vendettas. The effects, if that's all one goes to these movies for, are fine, though more fanciful than natural. But raptor movement STILL doesn't work.",Jurassic Park III

This movie was incredibly boring, unrealisitc, and just all around terrible.  There is no scientific angle to it whatsoever.  It is just stupid people running from dinosaurs.  The only good thing about it is that it is only 90 minutes long, and I am no longer scared of dinosaurs.  In fact, I find them funny.

I wonder if she happened to strain a vocal chord while shooting the movie....Laura Dern...she's ok, but why not be more noticeable in the movie, maybe exchange smart dialogs with Sam Neil.  Alessandro Nivola - ""have you ever heard of something called facial expression?  Fellings, emotions...""..he's got to work harder on that! Sam Neil, no big deal.

Drop some people on an island full of dinosaurs and watch them run for their lives.  That was about all there was to it.  The special effects were decent but not worth 8 dollars.  If you have a discount theatre in your local area, wait and see it for a buck.  I wouldn't even bother renting it.  That would be too much money for this unthrilling thriller.",Jurassic Park III

Spino fight, but I was disappointed to know that Tyrannosaurus Rex, THE KING of the dinosaurs, didn't have his comeuppance. Anyway, it has the traditional elements of a summer a movie, which you can all guess: not so good script, not so good acting, Mega special effects, and no chacter development. Another disappointing thing about the movie is its running time, a piddly 94 minutes. But throw all of those away and leave the hyper realistic dinosaurs and what have you got? Pure entertainment!

It stunned worldwide audiences with its amazing special effects, suspense, and very dark atmosphere. It quickly became one of the most succesful films in the world. A sequel was definitely inevitable...Then, in 1997, ""The Lost World: Jurassic Park"" was released. It was a big disappointment, because the characters were mainly flat, boring and uninteresting. People craved for more, and the franchise lay dormant and silent for a while, no word coming out whether or not there will be a third installment in the mega franchise...Come 2001. A THIRD movie is released, entitled "" Jurassic Park 3."" It was one of the few chosen saving graces of this summer season, and it does its job with an energetic passion.Jurassic Park 3 had one of the biggest July openings ever, raking in $19 million in its first day. Although it basically had a nonexistent plot, ""JP3"" was saved by its dark atmosphere, bloody deaths, aggressive leading dinosaur, and tension-wracked suspense.JP3's plot is simple. A divorced couple, hire Dr. "" No force on earth or heaven could get me to return on that island,"" Grant and his assistant Billy Brennan to look for their son on Isla Sorna. You'll later learn that the Kirbys, as the couple is called, had to trick Grant and Billy by offering them a blank check. They also aren't billionaires. Anyway, things go wrong as the film's new bad guy, the Spinosaurus, attacks them aggressively. He even kills the T-Rex just because he wants to chase them!They now have to get out of the island and, in the process, rescue the Kirby's son, Eric.JP3 had very good graphics. This is also one of the more positive aspects of the film. The ""Spino-Rex Fight"" was done perfectly, but I wish it was extended. It was only 30 seconds long, and I think audiences need a more elaborate fight to see.Overall, Jurassic Park 3 is a great summer blockbuster that's worth your dollar. One of the summer's few saving graces.

The movie answers to the standards of the industry with some efficiency with the suspense elements. Actors were pretty good too; including a different kind of casting for William H. Macy. Special effects did respond to what you expect in a such movie. The person I would like to throw something at, is the writer(s).

What we have here, ladies and gents, is what you can classify as ""The BATMAN plague."" You have a first film that was excellent. It was well-rounded, and more-or-less followed up to the expectations built around it. It is followed by a sequel that is not as good as the first, but thats okay. It was a worthy sequel, which followed up a the first film in a decent way. Then the #3 comes out. A new director steps in, while the old director simply produces. The plot is far too thin, the film is way too short, and all the while the movie seems to depend too much on ""crammed-together"" eye candy. They are now saying that they will make a JP4 if JP3 makes what they think it will make. Mark my words, this trend will continue. We will have a fourth film in which 30 minute cartoons have thicker plots. That being said, let me focus on a few gripes. As mentioned, the film is way too short, and there seemed to be no climax to the film at all. Worst of all: THE T-REX IS BARELY THERE. Not even that, the T-Rex got demolished in what little screen time he had. That is not supposed to happen to the T-Rex! The T-Rex is a Jurassic Park staple!

I was pretty sure they wouldn't participate if it was crap and the original *was* pretty great... *sigh*When the film started, I was a little wary. I'd ventured to attend the Wednesday opening and, being a fan of the 1st (and not so much of the 2nd), I was dreading disappointment. There were a few awkward moments as the film got itself off the ground, but once it kicked off it soared. Probably not above the original, but way above ""The Lost World"" certainly, and several other summer flicks I've seen.Neill, Macy, Téa Leoni and others did great work with what was given them and the dinosaurs (old and new) were (thankfully) impressive. I had fun and surprisingly (to me, at least), I might just have to see it again. `Jurassic Park III' is *far* more on par with the original than the second (which, IMHO, leaned more towards the overall quality of `Godzilla' '98).

New creatures were a treat but the raptor thing has been done to death. Sam Neill and Jeff Goldblum chemistry was the best (neither appeared together after the 1st and both looked lost without the other).Overall, the first was the best because it was a new experience.

What happened to character development, plotlines, and soforth? JP3 is technically great- an astonishing achievement. However the characters are shallow , the plot trite, and on the whole feels akin to an amusement park ride. The merchandising of these films is also nauseous-think Spinosaurus action figures, raptor lunch boxes, videogames etc. When the story is molded around special effects the result is a disjointed & shallow mess. For all the advances Hollywood has made the complete lack of attention to plot has left it soul-less. I won't even mention here the mish mash of Planet of the Apes-a total disaster!

There is very little of this Jurassic Park that had not been tried in the previous two.  Sure, they tossed in a few new interesting dinosaurs.  They also used Sam Neil, an actor that often catches my interest.  Unfortunately, it seems that the dinosaurs have a better dialogue than the actors.  The first few scenes without the prehistoric actors are almost too painful to watch.  Even the visual effects have some weak points, which include the obvious use of blue screens and the silhouette of a helicopter in one of the other scenes.  The music is very similar to a few other films I have seen... Jurassic Park and JP: The Lost World.  The plot is rather simple, people get stuck on the island and try to escape without being eaten, much like the first two.  At the end of the film, I was actually angry for having been duped into buying tickets and wasting my time.  My girlfriend was mad at me for dragging her to this movie.  I had to take her out to a nice dinner (another dent in my budget) to make her stop whining.  Yes, it was really that bad.",Jurassic Park III

It's comedy-horror with great effects. You start chuckling at the start, after the teaser, when a lecture audience (us, in other words) has no serious questions for Dr. Grant and he emphasizes there's no way he'll go back to the park...then there's the  plane ride-comedy, the bickering couple, the unmasking of the characters (""I'm not a real mercenary, just a temp""), the indestructible satellite phone which LITERALLY becomes one long running joke with humorous fake suspense (""C'mon, Baby Watson, put your mother on the phone before I get eaten - AHHHH!!!"" - classic MST3K), the absurd man in suit on the beach.  Even lil' Eric has some good lines. I only wish they had a close-up of Sam Neill at the end ryely muttering the explanation to how they get rescued, like: ""I guess Laura Dern's husband is a little higher up than a PR man for the government..."" As they say in the movie, people aren't always who they appear, and likewise this movie which may seem flat to JP fans(if you like JP1, then go rent it again and stop complaining) satirizes the genre rather than becoming another James Bond series; a welcome change from the usual formula.",Jurassic Park III

826,MarkBoston,JP3 is a shame to the series,2,7 August 2001,"I'm gonna make this short and sweet.Whenever sequels are made from a book-based film, and are not written by the author, the usually are terrible.Jurassic Park III lacks the intellectual content and well-written story that the Original Jurassic Park had. It jumps from scene to scene with little story to go along with the mindless action.Five minutes into the scene where the crew lands on the island, they are attacked by a Spinosaurus and that scence lasts too long as well. The first Jurassic Park scared you more in the scene where the T-Rex first attacks the Ford Explorer because it has so much non-action leading up to it that gets the suspense up; first the power goes out, then the Fords stop, then the T-Rex comes out, then the T-Rex attacks. In JP3, this is not the case. The plane lands, a guy gets eaten, the plane tries to take off, and crashes, and the dinosaur attacks the people. It all happens too fast. Sure, it has more action than JP 1, but there is little story to it.Joe Johston's directing is not as good as speilberg's, either, this shows with the lousy special effects.JP III is a shame to the name because the original was such a classic. Basically I disapprove of this story because: A. Barely any story B. Michael Chriton didn't write it in any way C.

Part of that goes to the films main antagonist, a hyper aggressive, awesome-looking and sounding Spinosaurus. This relentless beast creates several great action scenes like the river attack and Tyrannosaur fight.Yes, I know this was extremely controversial and kinda weird that they established the new big bad guy by killing the old one off with one kneck snap. How else was the spinosaurus supposed to go from ancient forgotten remains destroyed in ww2 to an immensely popular, widely recognisable mascot? Also the roar this thing emits is even better than the rex's in my opinion.The newer characters are mostly fine even though we are barely introduced to some of them. I thought Billy's redemption for stealing the eggs, by paragliding through the bird cage to save Eric was great. William H Macy as Paul Kirby had a few nice lines and best of all Sam Neill delivered fantastically again with Dr Alan Grant.Overall despite it's many flaws, I thoroughly enjoy this movie as it's simply the ""I wanna just see some cool dinosaurs and that's it"" entry to the franchise and I'm glad other people are liking it too nowadays.",Jurassic Park III

Sam Neil is a great actor but in this movie, he is as bad as the material. He is no where as good as he was in the first film, and unfortunately he character was not that interesting in the first film anyway. William H Macy Is some what decent but he himself becomes Annoying after while. The true horror is Tea Leoni, who plays probably the most character ever conceived. You yourself would be cheering for the Dinosaurs to kill this woman.The Special Effects are extremely dismal, Even for a Dinosaur film. At one point, The Spino Looks as big rubber puppet (Yes, that bad) and Changes Sizes through out the film. The Island itself looks like it was filmed in a Suburban park. It's nothing like the beauty and the savagery that was in The Lost World, and it's the same island.The Story is probably the most offensive part of the whole movie. There is no logic or common sense to be found in this story. It does not even follow the first two movies, and it's a sequel .The characters are just too stupid for words, and their reasoning for being on the island has to be one of the worse ideas of the history of bad ideas. The end thou is really the most offensive ending ever made because it just ends. It's merciful considering how bad this movie was, but there is no climax. It just ends with out warning, and with out pity. Like the film makers were trying to spare us from the worse thing ever viewed on screen.

Beginning with Dr. Grant's foreboding lecture, the movie feels as though Speilberg grabbed a random film student and said ""Here, make a bad sequel of my movie."" The animatronics are horrid, the acting is swill (which is suprising given those that starred), the screenplay was patched together from scenes in the first two novels not put in those films, the plot is as predictable as an overtold joke, and far too many people lived through their stupid mistakes. Oh yeah, I forgot. They destroyed one of the greatest villians of 90's cinema (the raptors) and turned them into feathery chimps. And just in case anyone who may be tied to the production of the fourth movie (trust me, when the sequels number 3 and are this bad, they keep coming), stop putting so many new dinosaurs on these islands.

Alright, let's get into the 'spirit' of this ass-fest and insert a bad dinosaur pun.Let's take a bite right in (GET IT?)Talented actors go to waste in this third installment of the once dignity-possessing series. I'm going to spoil stuff, because I already summed it up by saying ""fail"" so why not go further? A divorced couple (William H. Macy and Tea Leoni, two good actors who's talent is set aflame by bad writing) pretends to be married and tricks some emotionless character from the first film to come with them to the island to find their son, played by Trevor Morgan, a decent young actor who mysteriously isn't doing many movies anymore. Oh, and I shouldn't really call the main character emotionless. His thing is to grunt and complain and give warnings about the island's danger, even though no one really dies except a few background people and one character who gets about 30 minutes on screen. What a dick of a main character. No one here is likable. Unless you count Udesky, played by Michael Jeter (RIP) who seems to be the only quiet and innocent character. But, he's a balding mercenary, so of course he dies after 44 minutes or so. And he's also the only character to die that we actually got to know (sort of, not really). Tea Leoni's thing is to complain and whine. At least she still has a career. And I'm pretty sure this movie is the reason William H. Macy ended up having to star in ""Shorts"". Poor guy. He could have gone places after ""Fargo"". So anyways, Grant, the super-grumpy main character, is also a paleontologist. He has a sort of intern or student or something named Billy,who is a young paleontologist. He supposedly is killed by Pteranodons halfway through the film, but of course he's alive at the end. Speaking of the end, there's no climax, unless you count the confrontation with the raptors, but that wasn't even an action scene. And I guess director Joe Johnson thought it would be cool to be more ""scientific"" by giving only the male raptors feathers. Okay, but why are they blue, and why do the Pteranodons have TEETH? THEIR NAME MEANS ""WINGED WITHOUT TEETH""!!!! They even decided to put in a DREAM SCENE. No comment on that. I'm probably running out out of space, so I'll end on two positive notes-1.

The practical effects look cheap for a film that has dinosaurs in it and the new main dinosaur looks like a big and slim looking rubber duck who has believe it or not, a ringing cell phone in its belly for most of the film. The movie even gets worse from there believe it or not with one of the worst ending ever in a film, which is mercifully short.Do yourself a favor and just go from ""The Lost World"" and head straight into ""Jurassic World"" and make believe ""Jurassic Park 3' never happened. You will thank yourself in the morning.",Jurassic Park III
852,m-dresch,Jurassic Park III 10 out of 10 EXCELLENT,10,17 September 2010,"After the success of the first two Jp movies they decided to make a third one. The Story of it you probably now from the trailer so i'm not gonna explain it. But also if you have seen the trailer it still has a few plot-twists and an very interesting story.The movie itself is totally awesome, its great to see Sam Neill again and they figured out a very intelligent plot to go back to the island. Special Effects of this movie are fantastic they took everything from the previous movies and evolved it to Level 300. I like the new dinosaurs Espacilly Spinosaurus and the remodeled Raptors. The Characters are very cool as well. Sam Neill is nice to come back ,he is a lot different that from JP1. The Soldiars and pretty much the entire cast you don't want to see dying, what is something a lot of Adventure/Action movies fail to do.So thats pretty much it i could sit here and prays the movie for another hour. It has pretty much everything a movie of that kind should have: OUTSTANDING: Special Effects OUTSTANDING: Scary moments OUTSTANDING: CastSo yeah you should see it.",Jurassic Park III
853,TheCardinal,Utter rubbish,3,29 June 2005,"Jurassic park has fallen a long way since the original blockbuster. I feel very sorry for the actors who starred in this atrocity, Sam Neill especially.Pointless rescue plot which essentially involves the characters getting chased from point A to point B to point C while being chased by assorted reptiles.The dinosaurs were no more or less remarkable compared to similar special effects heavy films.I expect that this movie has killed the franchise, which is a little sad.To fill in my submission, I'm apparently required to use a minimum of ten lines. Ideally, I'd like to fill in that extra space with profanity. Seriously people, don't waste your time on this void of celluloid. Go and read a book, or even a comic, I don't really care. Watch Jurassic Park III at your peril, and don't say I didn't warn you. Filth of this magnitude is merely another shameful example of American Cinema at its worst.",Jurassic Park III
854,the_jp_freak,Nothing wrong with JP3,10,26 May 2003,"What's wrong with this film? The story makes sense and it's a great action-packed film! After the San Diego incident the whole world now knows that there are dinosaurs. So interested people go and see the island from the outside and do not go in it (duh!). It's bad enough already being a paleontologist, but because now that everyone knows there are living dinosaurs it becomes harder for paleontogists (like Dr.Grant) to get any funds. Which makes sense why he took the Kirby's offer (anyways Grant thought they were just gonna fly over it). It's a good little story, but it makes sense. Some people just can't think or are unable to fully analyze films. The only flaw I see in this film is when they said Eric Kirby was on the island for 8 weeks (unbelievable). Overall ""Jurassic Park 3"" is a good little film that does the franchise justice. 4 out of 5 stars.",Jurassic Park III
855,filmrolleke,Enjoyable but not as good as I hoped,6,2 June 2003,"This is defenetly no movietrash. I thought it was very enjoyable. But as the first JP is my favorite movie I was very disappointed with JP3. The acting was very enoying and bad sometimes, The story was too simple, the action sequences were much too similiar to those from JP and TLW, and the dinosaurs looked more like monsters than like natural living breathing dino's. But on the other hand I think it's an enjoyable movie that you don't have to take too personaly as the first film. And above all the pternodon sequence was one of my favorite action sequences from 2001.6/10",Jurassic Park III
856,davidtaylor755,Better than the sequel,5,1 June 2011,"I would describe Jurassic Park 3 as a well paced fun action film with a silly plot. I was not bored by the film but at the same time I wasn't utterly amazed by it either. The special effects by Stan Winston and the computer graphics team were superb from top to bottom. From the tiny Compsognathus to the giant Brachiosaurus, the dinosaurs looked great, and I was so happy to finally see flying dinosaurs in action. The look of the jungle was something I liked along with the decent performances. I heard they began filming before the script was complete which meant the plot was a bit of a mess. For me a movie that holds these contents cannot sustain great entertainment for a long period of time so I appreciated the shortness of the film. I liked it slightly better than the lost world but didn't come close to the greatest dinosaur film ever made Jurassic park one. If you're looking for a ninety minute B movie with dinosaurs chasing people and occasionally eating them with no moments of wonder, the film works. If you want awe, see the original. My very favourite moment in the film was the brutally fierce duel between Mr Spino and the T-Rex. One more thing I would like to add- the title, was that the best they could do?",Jurassic Park III

No theme parks, no English guys with twee Scottish accents, scary pterodactyls. 3d printing before it became a big thing, Some great comic scenes. The one and only problem I have is that the boy didn't close the door when he left his armoured home of the previous eight weeks, allowing anything to climb in and cause a nuisance later, but maybe even that is forgivable because I suppose he never intended to go back there. I would have closed the hatch is all.",Jurassic Park III
858,nathan-hamilton-266-567203,Sophomore Slump,6,16 January 2012,"Jurassic Park III is the millennium edition of the Spielberg thrill ride. But of course, Spielberg is no longer the director of the series, instead it is Joe Johnston who completely twists the original Jurassic Park movies that we once loved... and still do. With a 4 year spread between each movie, it was kind of hard to know what to expect when the newer one was released. Jurassic Park 2 was a successful hit, providing the same model as the first but with a different perspective. In this one, it seems like everything changed. The most significant difference is the effects. The dinosaurs in this one aren't remotely comparable to the first two. These dinos look almost animated, way worse than the original movies. Of course the T-Rex was well made and the raptors were created differently, the new dinosaur, the Spinasauraus, is an absolute disgrace to the trilogy. I can see what they tried to do here, but it just doesn't work at all and they really fell short in terms of effects. The acting also takes a weird twist, incorporating actors that we've never seen before. Sam Neill returns as main character and does his job well, but everyone else was just too new and too inexperienced to be able to insert into a series like this. They tried making something totally new out of an established series. The adventure part is probably the only decent upkeep about this movie. It is a lot shorter than the two other films, and spends a lot less time talking about nonsense. But instead, you've got the main plot of the movie which is now ""find our son"", which is a radical turn of events from the two others, which had a climactic, theatrical storyline. Also the actors spend a lot of time finding that the fact that they are stranded on an island, is a joke almost. The movie lost it's edge theatrically, it is a lot less stressful but I do admit that some sequences are pretty well thought out. I thought that the best part about this movie was the pterodactyl scene, which is very different than anything we've seen so far. However, the movie does not live up to the main series' expectations. It is definitely the trilogy's downfall, and cannot be compared to the first two. If I had to suggest this to someone, I would say if you're a die hard Jurassic Park fan... get this film. It is a solid addition to the series and you will most likely watch it once every year or two. But if you are a mediocre fan, I suggest you to simply rent this. It had way too much wasted potential and nobody should base this series off of this film. All in all i give this a 6.7/10, it is not a bad movie but could've been ten times better, had Spielberg been the director.",Jurassic Park III
859,paristehrani,Oh dear...........,3,27 February 2006,"I myself am a huge fan of the original Jurassic Park. Its sense of awe and wonder, and of course the velociraptors are what mad me love the first film. Obviously I was excited at the prospect of there being a third film, but when I saw it in the cinema I couldn't be more disappointed. Firstly, the whole feel of the film was different from the first two, simply because the direction duties went to Joe Johnston, an amateur compared with Steven Spielberg.Secondly, despite what many critics have said, I felt that the dinosaurs in this movie were no where near as realistic as those used in the original two films. In fact, the person I was with leaned over and said to me quite plainly, 'They look fake'! The dinosaurs didn't look frightening and lacked any real menace/danger that was so evident in the first film.Thirdly, the film's emphasis on humour, such as the mobile phone scene, just pulled the whole movie franchise down a level. In my opinion, the Jurassic Park films worked much better with less lame, stupid humour, and with more subtle, witty comments, which were provided by Jeff Goldblum in the first two films.I have to admit, the plot in this film is weak, and the ending is completely bizarre, and just ends up making the film one complete huge joke. As one critic said, it makes the first two films look like examples of 'epic and classic filmaking'. Quite right so. For anyone interested in seeing this film, I warn you to STAY AWAY, and watch only the other two in the trilogy, as, quite frankly, this is an example of how a sequel should not be made.",Jurassic Park III

And one of the survivors Dr. Alan Grant (Sam Neill) is asked to be a guide for the rich and happily married couple the Kirby's (William H. Macy, and Tea Leoni). They are adventurer's and want to fly over Isla Sorna to see dinosaurs. But after the plane crash the people Alan Grant travels with seems to not be the ones they said they are, and with dinosaurs smarter then primates, all hell breaks loose. JP3 is not the worst movie ever, but it's not a good movie. I have never understood the people that say they like this better the Lost World. And i hope i never will either. For me this movie feels like a Pizza without the cheese. JP3 only last 92 minutes. If they should do it right it would have lasted at least 120 minutes, and with a MUCH better story. There shouldn't be any Kirby's in the movie. Or a little Kirby that hides in a tank and saves Dr.Grant with smoke grenades, as he runs through the smoke in his jungle-ish clothes to save his ""hero"" Dr. Grant.It all looks so stupid and childish. This could have been a great movie. Because there is some GREAT ideas. For example, the birdcage. When they realize where they are (in a birdcage) it's scary and done really well. For one moment it is the JP3 it should have been. But it doesn't last long until it's back to the JP3 it sadly was.",Jurassic Park III

The special effects look like a major down grade from the last two films and the dinosaurs look more like mechanical puppets. Sam Neill is a very good actor but not even he could mask the contempt he has on his face for staring in this film. Sam did not look like he wanted to be there and his performance reflexes that in spades. The story makes no sense and the actions by the characters are so far out there that you are screaming in disbelieve on how stupid they are. William H Macy is a great actor and even he looks miserable being in this film. Macy in his credit is actually somewhat funny but not much else. Tea Leoni, who can be a very decent actor is just horrid here and Alessandro Nivola gives a useless performance and he's a good indie actor.I don't know what made the filmmakers here to go low rent but its the worst sequel in the series.",Jurassic Park III

868,sam-rs6,Interesting...,7,30 December 2005,"I have never actually used the term ""it's good in isolation"" until this moment.After much hunting, I came across the Jurassic Park box-set for a reasonable price, and naturally had to buy it- the films have been a favourite of mine since I had to be taken out of the cinema when I saw the first one...Jurassic Park III I felt was too... Hollywood. Not enough real life situations (Eric, not matter how good a Boy Scout he was, would NOT have been able to survive on a dinosaur-filled island for 8 weeks), and far too much in the way of 'overacting' (if that's possible). Téa Leoni annoyed me a lot in this film- SOMEONE STOP HER SCREAMING. The typical Hollywood end didn't appeal much, but still... it is American. Watching most of the mercenaries die in the first few minutes wasn't particularly appealing- where's the psychological element of waiting for them to get picked off??? Come on! Also, the noises the dinosaurs made... poor, to say the least. The first film had amazing, floor-shivering roars, and genuinely scary snarls and squeaks. This film obviously employed some guy making snarly noises into a voice disguiser for a phone. However, the bad points are few and far between... the only other one I can really think of is the end. It felt far too rushed, as if the film crew just realised that they had £5 left in the piggy bank- ""Hang on, guys- we're about to hit the red- take 6, and call it a wrap.""These bad points aren't enough to condemn what is essentially an enjoyable, and intelligent, film. A fair amount of the dialogue is fairly snappy, but not in places where it would be inappropriate. You've got to love some of the prophetic fallacy! The first encounter of the raptors also made me smile... mainly because I was waiting for Téa Leoni's character to get what she deserved. The fight scenes, dinosaur between dinosaur, were awesome. I still think that killing the original anti-hero of the first film is an unforgivable act, especially as the science books say that the killer is inferior, but re-using the same villains is wearing- as many horror films have proved...What I prefer about this (macabre as it sounds) is that you actually get to see people being eaten. The Lost World relied too heavily upon the ""psychologically effective"" blood-in-the- water (a good way to cut down on special effects by pouring a lot of red food dye into the water...). So it's refreshing, at least. The scene with the plane is also very good- atmospheric? Just a bit! The raptors also manage to create genuine suspense, and the way they are portrayed is chilling. I was also a fan of the ""large birds"" ;).In isolation, this film is a definite 7 out of 10- some bad points, but nowhere near enough to turn it into trash. Compared to the other 2... well, it can't hold a candle to the first one, but comes close to the second one.

I found the story trite to the point of inconsequential and the plot lines as underdeveloped as the dino embryos still locked in the shaving cream canister from Jurassic Park 1.  The editing was poor and none of the characters engendered any sort of sympathy or feeling.  In short, this movie lacked any of the suspense and thrill that the first movie provided from a story standpointEven the new dinosaurs were few and far between (although I really enjoyed the pterodactyls.)  We got several brief shots of the new species and only 2 really were involved in the action.As a scientist and former childhood paleontologist, the lack of any real scientific content (not that it had to be realistic, but logically formed i.e. how they built the dinos in #1 and malcom's chaos ramblings) was disappointing as well.In short, the movie seemed to be nothing more than an excuse to trot dinos back on the scene to make some money.

This film fell short of those standards. And when I think of about it, the flick falls short of most standards. Now in my mind Macy is one of the best actors. Look no farther then magnolia and my point will be proven. However I feel he wasn't at his best in the film. Why you ask? he wasn't acting badly my problem is he didn't grab me in anyway.

The spinosaurus was a fantastic addition and most of the effects were phenomenal. The plot was engaging..... but something was missing.Another user commented that hollywood seems to see only as far as the bank and I would share this view. Watching JP3 reminded me in many respects of tomb raider. Every event we witnessed seemed a token of what could and maybe should have happened. Like tomb raider, JP3 comes across as nothing more than an extended trailer! The raptor plot was barely explored, events and characters from the previous two films were whispered in passing, the t-rex made one scene and that merely served to assert the dominance of the spino. Worst of all, the subversive intellectual plot lines from the first two dropped for an extremely cheesy and unnecessary family values plot saved only by Macy's convincing but strained performance.Apparently there were numerous re-writes of the script. It is easy to imagine that there was once perhaps a purely intellectual script and a purely adventure script. JP3 comes across as an incomplete amalgamation of the two, desperately trying to offer interesting twists (like where did the spino come from since it wasn't on Ingens list and why did no one come across it in the lost world?) but failing to deliver and instead offering up a platter of short scenes to the fidgety and easily bored MTV generation that make up the target audience.",Jurassic Park III

Laura Dern is only featured a total of 5 minutes in the movie, so she doesn't bring much to the over all experience.My final verdict is that this is a movie that you can stay away from. Even if you do like the previous JP movies.",Jurassic Park III
885,paul.clegg,Leave your Brain and Enjoy.,8,20 July 2001,"I thought this film was just what you need for a summer blockbuster; scares, laughs, good action and the best nerdy action hero there has ever been. Sure you can rip the film to shreds every five minutes with an ""as if"" and a ""yeah right"" there but that kind of defeats the object of the film.  My advice is leave your brain at the door and enjoy, I did.",Jurassic Park III
886,parallax-8,"Well, it's better than 2",4,17 July 2001,"But that's not saying much.While watching this movie, I found myself liking it. However, about halfway through, and for the rest of the film, I found it lacking something, and it was hard to pin down exactly what.After a night of reflection, I realized what it was. The first film had depth. The first film had wonder. It had character. I'm not talking about the characters, I'm talking about the film itself. JP2, and to a lesser extent this movie, were far more concerned showing you as many different types of dinosaurs fighting in different ways than showing you the wonder and majesty of these animals. They tried to make a movie that was the last half of JP1, without the first half (Which many people hated. As a dinosaur lover since before I can remember, I loved it) and they ended up with a dozen or so strung together scenes with no reason behind why they were strung together.Or maybe the glamour is gone the third time around. In any case, if you plan on seeing this movie, and you have not seen JP1 or JP2, I suggest you go rent them first, and after seeing them, remember that this one is much more like 2 than it is 1. If you are planning on seeing this and have seen the first 2, rent 1 again, pop some Microwave popcorn, and enjoy a good dinosaur movie instead.",Jurassic Park III

It brought back Laura Dern (small part) and Sam Neil but nicely left out all the others.  The movie had its usual above par special effects and did have a plot, but one thing bothered me about this, it was less than 90 minutes long!  With all of the excitement and action, I left feeling like I just watched a typical Disney animated feature and didn't get my bang for the buck.  Overall I enjoyed it, the sound was great, and the acting was fine, but I can't give it a perfect grade for the short length. On the other hand, my legs and butt do rate this a 10 for minimal sitting in a crammed theater seat.",Jurassic Park III
888,canislupus,This movie really isn't worth it...,1,19 July 2001,"Personally, I am very disappointed with this movie. The story is so thin, the special effects are well made, yet not very ""special"".Only two new dinosaurs are introduced - the Spinosaurus and the Pteradactyl (not really a dinosaur) - and the rest of the movie is about the boring Veloci Raptors that now have learned how to communicate.The story is not by Michael Crichton. He's not been near the movie which is ""based on characters created by...""I think Steven Spielberg should be hung, drawn and quartered for producing this nonsense.Before watching JP3 I watched ""Blood for Dracula"" from 1974 and I enjoyed that movie a heck of a lot more.",Jurassic Park III
889,batturtle-2,Lots of fun...but why so short?,9,19 July 2001,"Jurassic 3 was probably the movie I was most anticipating this year. Even more so now that none of the big blockbusters so far have really blown me away. That said, Jurassic 3 came very close to being the first movie of the summer that didn't disappoint. Not surprisingly there were great fx, but I also really enjoyed the human characters (Sam Neill was especially good in a role he could have phoned in if he felt like it). The only major flaw was that it was so short (barely 90 min compared to 2 hours for the first two). When the credits star rolling there's a sense that someone forgot to tag on another 15 or 20 minutes to the thing. But, that said, what we have here is a tight, theme park ride of a summer popcorn movie. Plus there's flying dinosaurs, what more could you ask for?",Jurassic Park III
890,peggymacphie,"A little short, but great nonetheless",8,28 July 2001,"While only an hour and a half, and lacking the big blow-out ending of it's predecessors, this movie was great fun. William H. Macy truly shined in his role, and while Tea Leoni's primary job seemed to look and act frightened, she worked well with what she was given. And those of us who missed Sam Neill as Dr. Grant in JP3 are glad to have him back.",Jurassic Park III
891,jw_cloth,better than expected...,6,18 July 2001,"Well, let's face it, we all thought it would suck...and it didn't, not really. It seems like the creative team (and I use the term loosely) realized after the awful JP 2 that no one could ever take the franchise seriously again - and so they didn't either. Maybe being free from the influence of schlock-meister Michael Crichton helped, but the new-and-improved FX, the in-jokes (particularly Dr. Grant's snide remarks about Goldblum's character from part 1) and the total lack of any plot make this a relatively enjoyable ninety minutes. Not great, though, not by any means. As expected the supporting cast dies off in remarkably short order and the best actor in the whole thing is the kid - kind of like the exact opposite of the other two movies in the series. Put it this way - I went in fearing the worst and now I'm hoping they make part 4.",Jurassic Park III
892,rickyRodent,JP3 delivers the goods!,7,19 July 2001,"Those who criticize ""Jurassic Park III"" are obviously missing the point of what the summer movie season is all about.  Some might think it nice to have nothing but cerebral films with complex plots and interweaving storylines, but now and then some of us find it refreshing to have a movie that simply entertains.  What were the best parts of the first ""Jurassic Park"" film? The parts with the dinosaurs, of course.  The second film tried to give us more dino-action, but when the story moved to San Diego the T-Rex was not the only one guilty of running amok (wink, wink... Mr. Spielberg). ""Jurassic Park III"" is a fast-paced, exciting, roller-coaster ride of a movie.  There is plenty of dinosaur action and mayhem, and the characters are there to serve the story.  So what if there isn't that much to it. What does one expect?  The movie quickly moves us through the setup and into the action.  Sam Neill does a wonderful job of reprising his role as Dr. Alan Grant, and the companion characters do a fine job a creating plenty of situations that make for some rousing action set-pieces.  Bravo Joe Johnston for stepping into some big shoes and making a fun popcorn movie that, while not as novel as the first in the series (how could it be?), is every bit as enjoyable to watch.  This will definitely be included in my DVD collection someday.",Jurassic Park III

Nevertheless, do not worry because this is a good movie.  It's better than the second, (The Lost World) which I also liked, but still a ton of fun to watch repeatedly.  No real bad guys but a few easily solved problems between characters that is fit perfectly into the story.  It is mostly just a run though the island trying to survive until they can find help.  A missing half hour could have been used to make a much better ending but besides that a great movie to pass some time.  I gave it a score of 7/10 but with a better ending it would of got a 8 or 9.",Jurassic Park III

The person I feel really bad for, though, is Michael Crichton - the poor guy has his name in the credits of this ridiculous trash.  I went in expecting very little and got just that.To begin, the entire movie looked like it was patched together from modifying certain scenes in the original Jurassic Park.  There's nothing innovative about the special effects, and the characters spend the entire movie screaming and running.  The only saving grace in this movie is a decent scene in a giant bird cage.  That's the only thing stopping me from giving this a ""1"".2 out of 10.",Jurassic Park III

But that did not disappoint me, as I have come to fully expect little meat on my dinosaur plots.  But the special effects are mind bogglingly (is that a word?) real.  And William H. Macy is good as always.  Everyone who sees this will have their little nit-picks, but hey, it's so much better than the second one.  I think Joe Johnston deserves an award of some kind for not following the trend that movies tend to get worse and worse as they progress.  (Rocky anyone?)",Jurassic Park III
896,raket,Missed opportunity for a great trilogy,5,14 July 2001,"As could be expected, Jurassic Park III went further downhill coming from the first one. The first Jurassic Park was great: a good story line, brand new stunning visual effects, and most of all, originality. The Lost world, the second film, was more of that. As for the third one, you get the idea the writers must have spent months trying to come up with an original story. In which they didn't succeed. This film is build around a very average story line, for which they tried to make up with the same *old* visual effects.***SPOILER*** Dr. Grant accompanies a couple who go look for their son, who is missing on the island. This is pretty much it, the rest of the film is one big dinosaur-chase around the island. ***SPOILER***To not hammer the film completely, I think it's still a film worth seeing, of course only if you liked the first two. Some new dinosaurs, some nice effects (the bird cage!), the original music and a couple of actors from the first movie make it an hour and a half well spent.",Jurassic Park III
897,BigFatSquishy,What a disappointment!,1,24 July 2001,"This was by far the worst movie I have ever seen.  The first installment had the audience believing that dinosaurs could possibly walk the earth if enough DNA was found.  The second made it slightly more possible with its analytical portions in the exposition.  This third film (and I use that term VERY loosely) did a magnificent job of taking reality and dashing it to bits.  It had all the audience insulting humor and predictable plot of a bad 1950s B-horror.  It's no surprise that they couldn't get Spielberg to do this film; the script was not only full of holes, but also totally coincidental.  Plot points that are not explained.  Pointless characters. Furthermore, there are parts of this movie that contradict the first 2 films!  As far as the animation, the original JP of the 90s was far superior.  The close shots of these dinosaurs were about as impressive as the hand puppets sold with fast-food meals that came out with the original. Overall, a horrible film.",Jurassic Park III

900,thecartographer,Very good movie,9,5 June 2006,"Although I was sad to see Steven Spielberg was not directing this movie,I still enjoyed it.The movie looked very realistic and the area it was filmed in,which was Hawaii,was perfect as well as the new look of the dinosaurs.The Velociraptors looked better in the blueish-gray, than in the brown colors of the first and second movies,and the addition of the hair-like feathers looked good too.Also,in this movie,the dinosaurs acted more naturally and intelligent.One good example of this is the Velociraptors, they set traps and communicated,instead of just chasing the people.The fight scene between the Tyrannosaurus Rex and the Spinosaurus was also very realistic, the Spinosaurus winning made a lot of sense,because the Spinosaurus was larger than Tyrannosaurus Rex.Another realistic part was in the aviary,because the Pteranodons acted like a real flying animal with maternal feelings,like the Tyrannosaurs in The Lost World.Unfortunately,they should of put more dinosaurs in this movie, such as Dilophosaurus and more scenes with the Compsognathus.They also needed to put more scenes with the herbivores.The ending was a bit confusing because how did the marines find Billy if he was attacked by the Pteranodons?But in the scene where out of the helicopter window,they see the Pteranodons,it connects with an earlier scene,where they leave the aviary door open.So basically,this movie is as good as its predecessors.",Jurassic Park III

When the second came out I very disappointed, very poor story and the dinasours didn't even look as good. Well the same goes for three! From the trailer I thought it had potential to be almost as good as the first, but let me tell you. I was extremely disappointed. the movie was totaly different then the trailer, in fact I cant stand the movie.

You kinda feel wishing that the movie should have been held off until the two could have gotten together and made it. . . well, right. It was also missing those extra minutes that the first two movies had. It was as if they (the characters) were just rushing through the whole movie. There are some more things I didn't like, but there are some good things I did. I enjoyed seeing Alan Grant (Neil) and Ellie Sattler (Dern), Some of the old and new dinos, and the special effects.

(i.e.-  when the girl says ""this is how you make dinosaurs?""...i found myself saying ""no, this is how you play god""...two seconds later, grant said the exact same thing.  i think that line was used in part I also. -1 for ***spoiler**** * * * * * killing the damned t-rex, king of dinosaurs+1 for awesome action scenes.so i ended up giving the movie 6 out of 10 stars...worth a viewing, but i'd rather just watch part I over again",Jurassic Park III
904,ayame_x,Disappointing and choppy,4,18 July 2001,"I thought the movie was disappointing and choppy. It could have done a lot better with Spielburg as the director. Scenes were not very climatic and especially the end was not very climatic, almost seemed put together at the last minute kind of end. I think the dinosaurs looked better in the first one, not because of technology but because Spielburg directed the film in a way that even when you didn't see the dinosaurs you were terrified! The spinosaurus was not that terrifying and the velociraptors disappointed me. I thought they were going to be shown as ruthless and intelligent. But they were way off from even the velociraptors in other movies. The scenes also seemed choppy and didn't really add to the story line. If you took all the island scenes and mixed them up you would have gotten the same story set up. This movie sacrificed movie plot for the special dinosaur effects (which are only impressive if used correctly - which they were not). Too much was told to the audience instead of being shown by scenes and subtleness. I don't like the part where allen grant and Ellie were in their kitchen and all of a sudden allen has a revelation that he explains in detail which gives away all suspense that people might have. I mean would have been so bad that Grant find out about the velociraptors abilities in the park along with the moviewatchers? I mean we all know they are bad and vicious from the first movie, so that wasn't needed to drive the point that these are bad creatures that will kill. It just would have been a terrifying moment for the audience to find out that the velociraptors are talking to each other and they can communicate attack patterns. Also the camera work was shaky in some of the birdcage scenes. You never knew what was going on and therefore didn't really feel any danger for the characters. Also there was very little doubt that the characters weren't going to make it out of there alive. I mean I pretty much guessed who was going to die almost right away...",Jurassic Park III

Saw it twice yesterday and I'm still thinking about it. Some of those scenes left me breathless, and it was wonderful to see a sold-out, packed theatre with fellow fans all around me react to the magic on the screen. I found a lot of the reaction to be laughter, which in a way is good (it shows they were listening, anyway), but people were gasping and muttering ""oh no""s, too. What was I doing? Gaping at the screen, hungry for action and new dinosaurs. I got plenty of both: the Spinosaurus, the renovated Velociraptors, a Ceratosaurus, Ankylosaurs, Corythosaurs, the works. Even some cool pterosaurs. The fight between the Spino and the rex was great, but I hated the victor for what he did to the hero of the previous two movies...The plot and dialogue was lacking in some places, but for me the wonderful thing was to see the dinosaurs. Isn't that a major part of these movies in the first place? All in all, a worthy installment to the series.  Fair enough job, Mr. Johnston.",Jurassic Park III

This time they're meaner, and they're smarter. This movie is a thrill ride from start to finish. Sam Neill is back as Dr. Alan Grant and he does a wonderful job playing the paleontologist. Grant really doesn't want to see any more dinosaurs up-close and personal, yet it is tempting for him since dinosaurs are his life. The rest of the cast do a good job too, especially the boy played by Trevor Morgan. This time, the child in the movie is not screaming all the way through -- he's more smart about dinosaurs, even though he knows when it is the right time to run for his life! The special effects in Jurassic Park III don't disappoint either. It's amazing what can be done when it comes to bringing these dinosaurs to life. Plus, Jurassic Park III adds humour which turns the thrill ride into an even more entertaining thrill ride.

909,Kevin J Cole,A triumphant return to the series,10,18 July 2001,"First came Jurassic Park. One of the greatest films in history. I saw that at the theaters more than seven or eight times, and I was pretty young. Then, four years later, came The Lost World. Not good. I expected too much out of it, and what was the stuff about T-Rex getting onto San Diego. Let's keep them on the island, I ended up only seeing it maybe three times in theaters. And I'm still debating on whether I should buy the DVD. And now, ironically, four years later, Jurassic Park III hits the big screen. I am one of those hardcore JP fans, and I must say that this movie was one of the greatest sequels Hollywood has ever made.When I first heard of them making another sequel, I thought, ""Oh man."" But then, the news started rolling in. Sam Neill is going to reprise his role as the infamous Dr. Alan Grant, who was sorely missed in the second film. I thought he did such a fantastic job, that he topped all of his other films. Then came Laura Dern as a cameo. She does a great job, and it seems to be more than just a cameo role. It was a vital role for this film to be a success. William H. Macy, Tea Leoni, and Trevor Morgan, make the characters realistic, and I'm not usually a fan of Tea's, but this film made me want to go back and see her other films.Then, of course, there are the dinosaurs. Spinosaur kicked major butt in this film. He knocked the crap out of T-Rex. The raptors were finally smart. The first one, they were mysterious. In the second one they were clumsy and stupid, but in this one they were very intelligent. They learned to set traps, and learned to look at all their options before attacking, thus proving Grant's theory about their intelligence. I've only seen it once, but trust me, it won't be the only time. I plan to see this film more than ten times in theaters, and, not to mention, buy the DVD when it comes out in December. Speilberg did an excellent job producing, and Joe Johnston deserves great recognition for this phenomenal picture. I had also seen A.I. this weekend, and JP3 was far better.",Jurassic Park III

912,evanholmes,Better with Age,7,22 January 2007,"I recently re-watched the JPark trilogy. Because of its freshness, pacing and breadth JP1 remains a classic, both of film and entertainment. JP2 however doesn't hold up well; it is far too contrived and hokey. The fantastic becomes boring when each scene tries to out-do the previous. The surprise for me was JP3, which has an acceptable script, a good flow and a realness to the acting. It is far better than I remembered - in fact I came to realize that a lot of my favorable impressions of the trilogy actually came from #3. The scheming and desperation and repentance of William Macy's character creates pity and disgust and frustration which is not only well demonstrated by the other characters but can be felt by viewers, as well. The audience can participate in the emotional flow. I enjoyed the interjected humor and the way the action was balanced out. And like with JP1, I'm glad the director realized that an action movie could also be scenic. I'm ready now for 2008's JP4.",Jurassic Park III

Let's face it, these movies aren't aimed at being Oscar worthy, they are aimed at the audience, and making an enjoyable movie for the audience. Of course, it is a blessing to have Steven Spielberg helping you out. If he abandoned the project early on, I would have had low expectations for the movie, but his contribution is valued, and Joe Johnston's approach to the movie is perfect.

It didn't bother me that Lost World wasn't as intellectual as the original, and here, I was just hoping for a good monster movie.  It was all about ""Dinosaurs eat people.""  However, it was disappointing even on that level.For starters, there were not enough people to eat, and while I'll keep it a secret how many people get eaten, it was not enough.  Also, while there was no shortage of variety in the dinosaur community, there were not nearly ""enough"" dinosaurs.  And many dinosaurs, like the spikey-back-and-has-a-club-on-its-tail-osaurus, just made cameos and didn't do much considering how cool they are.(START SPOILERS) Then there were the Pterodactyls.  The figures I've read put their body weight at about 15 pounds, while the movie made them look closer to 300.  Worse, they didn't get to eat anybody, or even splatter them on the rocks by dropping them from high up.  There was no ending to the movie, either, it was just, all of the sudden, credits.  (END SPOILERS)  I'm left wondering if the edition I saw was missing 40 minutes of film.My only conclusion can be that they taught the Pterodactyls to stick their long beaks stealthily into your pockets and get your $7.

917,blasiak,Real people; real dinosaurs; real entertainment.,9,19 July 2001,"JPIII has some of the best dinosaur performances to ever grace the screen. These creatures aren't just cardboard cutouts.  Each variety has its own personality, and, in a rare triumph of film-making, they don't even remotely resemble people.  After all, it is tedious, annoying, and all too common, to have dinosaurs, aliens and various other monsters with human drives and emotions.  JPIII lets them be the inscrutable creatures they would have been.  And, as with the creatures, JPIII lets its people be people. There's no wise-cracking side-kick, no impossibly spunky child, no overwrought emotions.  Dr. Grant is a genuine scientist, tired and wishing he were anywhere but that island, but still capable of wonder.  The Kirbys act like normal people would under the circumstances.  Their hysterics are reserved for extreme moments and pass just as quickly, slipping back into their mundane behaviour as soon as the danger passes. There are no bigger-than-life heroes here; no comic relief.  Because of that, Jurassic Park III may have the kiss of death about it.  People wanting ""Die Hard"" action with sassy ""Rush Hour"" dialog are going to be disappointed.  JPIII doesn't follow the Hollywood mentality for stereotyping both character and action. Of course,in this era when films are critically panned for not being predictable, it seems unlikely that JPIII will be treated kindly.  But if you are bored with the clinical entertainment of ""Tomb Raider"" and ""Pearl Harbor"" or the blatant emotional manipulation of ""Castaway"" and ""AI"" you should find JPIII refreshing.

Adapted from the book with the same name? Give me a break the only thing that was the same would be the name of the island and that there were two kids. Drifting that far from a half-way decent plot into something resembling king-kong is not what I expected.That said you can understand why I wouldn't have high expectations for the third in the series. Well I'm glad to say it isn't a total slap in the face. If the first movie was half a novel, and the second the inside cover, the third installment is a few pages in length. Crafted in the same fashion as a comic book, jp3 brings you action and a touch of what was. A short visit to the island nothing more. No plot and no character development. It's almost a trailer expanded into a whole movie. Full of action but no substance.It's hard to rate a movie like this. If your going to see the action it won't disappoint. And you'll be hard-pressed to realize there is no story the action is non-stop. You won't even notice you missed anything until it's over and your left with this weird unfulfilled feeling. What is it? Lack of story. I only give it 7 out of 10 because it is Jurassic Park. Had it been anything else I would give it a 4.",Jurassic Park III
919,eikochan,Why???,1,23 July 2001,"To sum it up, I actually wanted more characters to get eaten. They were poorly directed and annoying. The dinosaurs - sure, they looked pretty real, but the scare factor the trailers seemed to entice weren't even there. Why do they keep adding to an old franchise? Pretty soon, even the food supplies on Isla Sorna are going to get old and then what are the stranded people going to eat?",Jurassic Park III
920,chosen_1,A Perfect sequel to the first and second!,10,26 July 2001,I saw this movie the first day it came out and i can tell you that the theatre was packed! Everyone was excited to see it! The special effects were terrific.... i think by adding a new dinosaur made it more interesting and fun... its all action packed!! The cast was terrific including the dinosaurs. Because the dinosaurs could speak to each other this made the plot more interesting. It is one of the best movie's i have ever seen!!,Jurassic Park III
921,frostbyter,Loads better than JP2,7,18 July 2001,"When Jurrasic Park premiered in 1993 it had some of the most amazing special effects wizardry ever seen. The movie was intense, shocking, and most of all fun. It had a great score that will probably always be connected to this series of films. It was truly a great movie... Then, The Lost World came out, and not only didn't even compare to the first, it was a travesty, a joke, and even worse than that... It was a Godzilla movie, pretending to be something that it wasn't. I saw that movie once, and swore that I would never waste precious seconds of my life watching it ever again. So needless to say, I had low expectations of the third installment of this series.I was very surprised.Granted, the film was short, and relied heavily on the precedent set by the first film. But Thank GOD they didn't do anything to remind you of how awful the second movie was. Sam Neill really makes the JP movies what they are, he has style and a certain charisma that he brings to the screen. Without Neill, you just don't have a Jurrasic Park movie... And this film proved that sentiment.I didn't like the opening sequence with Laura Dern, but it turned out to be a stage upon which the movie needed to start (Thanks to the End)No spoilers here, if you want to know what happens... Go see it for yourself!!! Trust me, it's worth the money to see it in the theatre, if not for what you see... Then DEFINITELY for the sound effects. (Very cool 3D sound all around)I've read both books... And was disappointed they didn't try to be faithful to them. But with a third installment, I've come to accept that we will never see the ""invisible"" dinosaur from The Lost World.So be it... I still enjoyed this film. If they would have just not made the second film at all, and gone straight to this one I would have been much happier with this series. They took all the good scenes from the book that they left out of the first movie, and put them in this picture. How clever.",Jurassic Park III
922,obi_gui,"Virtually, a failed attempt at repeating the hype over the first two films",4,23 July 2007,"There are two ways you can see this film: either a usual movie, or a sequel to the Jurassic park series. If you choose to ignore the previous facts attached to the JP universe, what this film offers you is a cheap, easy survival movie where the enemies are dinosaurs.In itself, the subject is interesting and ""cool"", but the way they used it to form a plot was uninteresting and unoriginal: a bunch of middle-class people being thrown in a dinosaur infested island looking for a kid.Now, if you have to compare it to the first 2 films of the franchise, it gets even worse. What first comes to my mind is the style of the movie and it's atmosphere: in Jurassic Park and in its sequel, you had a change in mood that reflected to social situations explained in their respective films (JP1 was a movie about new technologies and showed the duality between great ambitions and critic regard of the consequences behind every action you decide to take, JP2 was about preserving what's left of the good side of your acts and interfering with those who did not yet achieve this state of consciousness) as opposed to this film, where stereotypes and rests of the first installments are brought up to screen without trying to satisfy the hunger for what made JP1 and 2 better films.In fact, they loosely followed the setting of these movies: a rich man walk to Dr. Grant's digging site offering him a trip to a dinosaur island... and ends with Dr. Grant looking at birds (this time, it's those flying dinosaurs) trough an helicopter with a satisfied look on his face. But between those two parts, there's no food for thought, and if you defend it calling it a ""pure entertainment"", let me call it a cheap one. As for the characters, they are merely shallow clones (!) of the ones they previously incarnated: Grant is a bitter man who at some point in the film shows contempt on Ian Malcolm's preaching, yet the only 2 lines (with variations) of what he says throughout the movie are ""Don't do that"" and ""Ingen played god when they shouldn't have"".Much of the magic that made JP1 a terrific film and JP2 an OK flick is gone as the only things I looked forward to by the first 20 minutes of the film was seeing as many humans being torn apart by dinosaurs as possible and in how many different ways. I was even disappointed by that, because Universal wanted the movie to be PG-13, so they could earn a few dollars more.And, as for a more formal analysis of the movie, the actors couldn't develop a good chemistry with each other, as they delivered their lines rather cheesily and perhaps undirected. The special effects were as good as usual, but less money in it, and more in efficient scriptwriters would have helped building a story without a book of Michael Crichton in the background. The dialogues were repetitive and unenjoyable, the realisation uninspired and the result, a LAME B-movie that should be categorized as a dinosaursploitation since I believe none other than a fan blinded by great expectations could enjoy it, and if it is not your case and you really want to take a look at it, download it: prove with a small action that you won't pay for the crap (synonym censored here) they show you, no matter if the props man no.2 is starving on the streets or if Tea Leoni can't afford another plastic surgery/mansion (if you can't look beyond that last statement and plainly consider it at first degree, do yourself a favor and ignore it instead of showing how much an intolerant dinosaur you are -> addressed to intellectual rights self-righteous rats).I would like to describe with greater words what I think of Joe Johnston, but it wouldn't be allowed by IMDb's terms of use.",Jurassic Park III

926,meimportapoco,The Lost World kisses it's a** goodbye,8,14 July 2001,"Jurassic Park III is what The Lost World should have been but failed to. The first Jurassic Park was a big blockbuster hit, but it had a lot of elements for dinosaur fanatics that made it slow for some other people. The third installment is all about action and effects. Great new dinosaurs appear on screen and chase the dull humans with no mercy. Although the script is pretty stupid on the plot department, the action sequences are really interesting, and they are a lot. Not just two or three big action sequences just to have some adrenaline. There are actually three new species for the third Jurassic Park, we get to see an Allosaurus, some Ankylosaurus and the Spinosaurus, which is pretty scary and can beat the hell out of any other dinosaur around. But the amazing thing is that the Velociraptors still are scary and menacing. I think the Jurassic Park films feature some of the best computer generated FX ever, and this one tops the other two. Some daylight scenes seem too real, although there are some which still look computer made, like the ones with all the herbivore species next to the river.There is violence, mild but still way better than Godzilla (1998), he chase scenes are really tense, and the Pteranodon sequence is one of the best moments in the movie. This JP is a no-brainer for sure, but it's one hell of a ride, way better than Tomb Raider, Pearl Harbor, and most of the summer trash that has been running in theaters this year.",Jurassic Park III
927,Pierredasnake,"Better than the second, and not a ""Dino-Yawn""",10,16 July 2001,"I like the way in this one that they perceived raptors as something other than mindless killing machines that killed even when they were hungry. This one was also a lot better for the reasons that it didn't have any cheesy scenes like the Second Jurrasic park. Like in the end, where the girl does gymnastics and miraculously kicks the raptor off the platform and then he gets impaled, give me a break. This one was far better than the second one, but still not as good as the first one. Its always hard to top the first movie in a series of them. I'd recommend this movie to people of any age, its quite a thriller in some parts, you even hold your breath.",Jurassic Park III
928,funkin,Great - but could have been longer!,7,15 July 2001,"Well, the film started promisingly enough with the initial sequence being typically disturbing and setting the tone for the rest of the movie.We get to see Dr Alan Grant again (yay!) along with Ellie - and whilst the part she plays in JP 3 is a small one, it is very important nonetheless.The dinosaurs are as fantastic as ever and as an ex geological sciences student, still bring tears to my eyes!  We see the introductions of some new species, along with some old favourites, and are made to really think about some theories of ""recurring villains"" from the previous films! My main quibble with the film is that it isn't as suspenseful as JP 1 and is nowhere near long enough.  Even as the end credits were about to roll, I was saying, ""that can't be it??"" - but it was.",Jurassic Park III
929,Jesh66,Not nearly as bad as what some people have said...,8,16 July 2001,"Do they break new ground on plot development,not really, but they do add interesting aspects to the veloceraptors, introduce new dinosaurs and generally take us on a 90 minute thrill ride.Overall worth the price of admission. The introduction to new dinosaurs otherwise absent in the previous movies are a welcome addition and alone worth seeing. The acting was fine. C'mon look at the cast... Sam Neil is a class act, William Macy is very good as well. The young man in it, i believe his name is Alessandro Nivola, did a great job. So be prepared to suspend disbelief and enjoy the movie for what it is. A damn good adventure story. I mean really, it's not supposed to be the sequel to War and Peace.

The dinosaurs in this one seem to be more realistic with technologies help no doubt. The movie is more intense than the other two.

Now, don't get me wrong, I liked the first two movies alright, but I mean, come ON, people! It's like the old saying, ""Two's company, three's a crowd."" In my opinion, this has gone overboard. There are some good aspects, but the bad tend to overthrow the good, in this case. For example, the graphics were 'a little bit of alright', but they didn't show enough dinosaurs besides the T-rex and the Raptors, so what's the point? Or, that some parts were great, and made you jump out of your seat, but there was NO PLOT! ""There they are. Run. Must get off island. There they are again. Run."" Doesn't quite cut it in my book! And while the first two had the same underlying plot, they weren't nearly as predictable as this one.

Essentially they spend the whole movie running away from small dinosaurs and one really big one, just like in Aliens. If you go to this movie expecting to see ""Citizen Kane"" or are looking for Oscar winning performances from the cast, you are an idiot!

It was a shame to put such talented actors in such a cast, but it shouldn't matter to them, they got paid rather decently I'm sure.

The action in the movie provides interest to move the audience to keep watching, but the sequences are not that great. The directing was there, but it did not provide the audience with good pictures and awesome action moves. Joe Johnston did not do his job too well, from the standpoint of a director/actor. The characters lacked development, and Sam Neill relied too heavily on his previous character in JP 1. William H. Macy and Michael Jeter held the acting together. In addition, some plot devices worked to confuse the audience and become unreal. The overall movie was a cut-and-paste project using parts from the two novels by Michael Crichton and assorted pop culture plot devices. Also, the element of theme and what the viewer takes home were absent. There were no universal truths, life lessons, or developments in the characters and their environment. I am disappointed that Steven Spielberg attached his name to this production without fixing these basic errors.

It took me back to the first Jurassic Park and the memories of me as a young little guy waiting in line with my mom and dad to see a movie that was a milestone for kids and adults alike. I do however agree that the second Jurassic Park sucked. It was missing the original characters that survived like Dr. Grant. This movie some what makes up for the long grueling 2nd jurassic park. While at time this movie may have gotten a little far fetched and I do agree it had some pot holes in the script it's a good chance to see the jurassic park style in the theaters if you missed it the first time round. Plus think about it this way...it's a lot better than seeing Pearl Harbor for the 50th million time.oh...and it IS funny.....if you hear a cell phone ringing during the movie...it's no the person sitting next to you ;) hey who would known dinosaurs are hip and trendy too,Jurassic Park III

This is a business, just like fast food chains. An industry with the sole objective of making money. And if they can do that with out going through the trouble actually creating a ""good"" movie, then its all the more convenient for them isn't it? I'm not saying a like the way things are headed, but I do feel that I'm one of the few that has come to accept this completely and have ultimately taylor my expectations to these changing times. In this day and age I have finally come to realize the IMMENSE difference between a ""film"" and a ""movie."" Being able to make this destinction allows me to lower or higher the bar before I journey to the megaplex. People are far too critical of movies that don't even take themselves seriously.

Oh, and this one's my favorite, ""I've seen it done before."" It's a sequel!! They made another one because people want to see more of the same thing...it's what we call a sound investment! How can you judge a Jurassic Park movie for subjects worth disscussing after ""The Godfather?"" This picture deserves credit for what it does...entertain. Joe Jonston has given me exactly what I wanted...a thrill ride. A short, light, fast paced adventure movie. I'd also like to thank the director for having the balls to break away from Spielberg's style, which makes this movie feel fresh and almost detatched from its predecessors. All I can say to those who were arrogant enough to criticize this picture as if it were an oscar contender is...grow up. Hollywood is changing, even if for the worse, it's definately changing.

You cannot do better then Spielberg, 2. The plot was too thin, and jumpy. 3. It was a short movie.  They go from a scene with Raptors in which they barely get away from to a beach scene where the ARMY, NAVY, AND MARINES come to save them.  It rolls on to the same old expectations.  Jurassic Park 3 didn't even need to made.  They closed the book with the second one.  All MCA/UNIVERSAL wanted to do was have movie that could make some money during the summer.  You have FOX releasing Planet Of The Apes in 2 weeks which will win summer time box office race.  MCA/UNIVERSAL Just wanted to steal some spotlight.  Back to the trilogy rules.   Every great trilogy always had a surprise you never thought of.  Jedi had it, Godfather had it Indiana Jones had it.  So did Scream and Kevin Smiths films had it too with Clerks, Mallrats and Chasing Amy.  The third one always tells you something you thought you knew but had no idea.  So since Jurassic Park 3 was just another walk in the park so to say.  I would tell you to expect a Jurassic Park 4. ""THEIR BACK AND MAD IN MONTANA.""  If you disagree with me then what ever.  I don't really care.  I was just sad to see a great franchise bite the dust.  I know the movie will make money cause it has to.  So I'll say the movie makes 200-250 Mill. Here in the USA.

The only way this series should keep going is if they move back to the original, interesting island.But the dinos alone are almost enough to make the difference.  The fight between the Spinosaurus and the T-Rex is worth the price of the ticket. The great pteradon scenes are icing on the cake.But I do recommend that you leave the theater early.  The ending is EXTREMELY weak(its kind of interesting, but not good), and you will leave the theater disappointed.

When J.P.2 came out, I saw it the first day it opened - and was more or less disappointed in it. Too much bloodshed and jump scenes, but then these are dinosaurs.  What would we expect if such a thing became a reality?  I really didn't have any desire to see it again, until J.P.3 was made.  The very same day I saw number 3 and after I sat through the 90 minute film, I went out and bought, then viewed, number 2 just to compare.  Big difference.  Even though J.P. 2 was bloodier, it had by far the best 'fleshed' out story line than the first and - certainly - the third installment.  If Spielberg had added 20-30 minutes more to J.P.3's length just to add some depth to his characters, the movie might have topped the first two, or at the very least, been equal to them.  Still, the dinos are great eye candy and I loved every minute that they were on the screen. Kudos to the CGI team and others for incredible realism!!  Too bad the actors were given such miniscule script.  It was a great cast; the acting was terrific (especially T. Leoni's too real reaction to too many stresses - even though I thought what an idiot the character was to go half-crazy screaming through a dino-filled jungle.  Personally, she responded the way I would, I think! But, I was sitting safely in my theater seat, so it was easy to be critical! ).  Yet, with all the intense acting, they just couldn't fill in the gaps that Spielberg created when he made them bit players ( no pun intended) in this dino flick.  Steven should have given more screen time to creating real people.

The plot was contrived, and entirely unoriginal. The circumstances by which the characters end up with the dinosaurs once more are implausible (even by movie standards), and the film has a plodding pace that makes it tedious. It seems to be more like a narrative - ""And then this happened. And then this happened. And then this happened..."". The character development seemed forced, and phoney as well. Boring, boring boring.I have to admit, the action scenes were often corny enough to make me laugh out loud, which I'm sure wasn't their intention at all. There's quite a parallel with the Batman series, the first two films were the best ones, but in the third and especially the fourth, the emphasis was more on big action scenes, at the expense of other scenes.

This is a fast paced adventure film that gets and keeps your attention from the second the cast lands on the island.

Plus Laura Dern always seemed like she was about to cry.Lost World was so much more complete as a movie-despite a few stupid scenes and character decisions. I will never fathom why a movie that was actual ABOUT the dinosaurs would rate lower than the original--which featured far less. Even the dialogue was more alive--not just technobabble or moralizing about the importance of children and family, and the ending was a real ending--no magical appearance by a T-rex out of thin air like in JP 1.
JP3 was made to finish off the scenes left out of the others--this time the highlight was pteradactyls. Sam Neill was given much more to do than in the first JP. I didnt buy the kid surviving for 8 weeks in the wilds--but at least he wasnt annoying. As a dumb action movie it was okay--but there still was far too little dino scenes. The T-rex vs Spinosaurus fight should have been movied to the end-and expanded a bit longer...anything would have been better than the actual ending(but it still wasnt as weak  as JP 1). The shots of the pteradactyls flying alongside the plane was what should have been seen at the end of the first movie.As for the awe factor that people keep mentioning--you cant expect to be wowed by the fx like in the first movie. For one thing--too many other films borrowed the fx technology--people were used to it. For another--Spielberg was and is a cheapskate. He wouldnt show more of the dinos than he had to in order to tell the story. Few lingering panoramic shots of the dinos, etc.Thirdly--there is a conflict. On one hand, they want to tell a Frankenstein like story about genetic engineering, but they also want to wow you with the products of that--namely the dinosaurs. Its hard to balance the two.I just hope they stop it now. They have really milked this movie series to the fossilized bone.",Jurassic Park III
952,eagles013,enjoy for what might have been without comparing to the present,8,23 July 2001,"I got what I expected. I have always been interested in dinosaurs. This movie did nothing to usurp that interest. For those of you who want to see humans act, try another movie. For those of us who want to see what dinosaurs might have been like, this movie should be on our must see list. The story is about something we can only hypothesize about, so we have no facts to compare this to anything real. This was just to be a fantasy/adventure movie, and that is what it is, so do not try to read anything into the movie. Sit back and enjoy the unknown. The actors are not the stars of this 'series'. Michael Crichton never intended this to be a movie series. He just wanted to pique our interest, and he has done that.",Jurassic Park III

Paul Kirby, the father, and Amanda Kirby, the mother, played by William H. Macy and Tea Leoni, hire a few mercenaries and convince famous paleontologist Dr. Alan Grant, played by Sam Neill, to accompany them on an aerial tour of Isla Sorna.  Little does Grant know that the Kirby's original intent was to land and find their son, and he doesn't find out until it's too late.  I reserved tickets for this movie, and saw it on the first day at the first showing.  Although shorter than the first two, it was a lot different, with different dinosaurs, a little more humor, and a few cool scenes from the first two books that were not in the original movies.  I waited two months for this movie to come out, and I'll tell you it was worth the wait.  It was a very good movie, definitely better than the first sequel, and although the original JP will always be better in my opinion, this one was very satisfying.  With better special effects and more action, I recommend this movie to any Jurassic Park fans who are sick of hearing about InGen.***1/2 out of ****",Jurassic Park III

The computer animated graphics definatley lacked the brilliance of the first 2 movies. It's like they wern't even trying with this one.  I thought that it might be okay that it was really short, because it was a thriller type movie and that way you wouldn't leave being absolutely worn out.  I was wrong with that assumption.  It was so short you had no time to get involved with the characters, it doesn't give you any time to have any kind of feelings for them.  Dr. Grant it taken back to Hell on earth and he's nowhere near as upset as you would think he should be.  There is no climax what so ever. The movie just kind of ends, with a short raptor seen and there we have it, you're going home mad that you've wasted $6.50 and an hour and 20 minutes of your life.

Better than the Lost World, but not quite up there with the original Jurassic Park. Ok, now that the polite thing is through, let's begin. I felt that this movie was a bit of a disappointment. It came off to me as a jumbled-up mess that borrowed parts from Michael Crichton's books that the first two movies didn't use. Ok, remember Mad Libs? The game where each person took a turn adding another crazy twist to a story? I think that's what happened here. ""Hmmm... Story's getting slow... Hey, I know!

The plot goes like this: While parasailing, a thirteen year old boy named Eric Kirby crash lands on the infamous island of Isla Sorna (InGen's Site B). Eight weeks later, his parents (Paul and Amanda Kirby) ask help from Dr. Alan Grant. Grant was on Isla Nublar when genetically created dinosaurs ran amok. Grant is now studying a theory of the intelligence of velociraptors. Paul and Amanda decieve Grant by telling him that they will sponsor his dig if he can be their guide when flying over Isla Sorna. Grant reluctantly accepts. Little does he know that Paul and Amanda are really looking for Eric. The plane crash lands on the island and three people are killed by the dinosaurs. Grant will now be able to test his theory on velociraptors first hand. Not only does the remaining party have to get Eric and get out, they also have to face horrifying creatures undisclosed by InGen.",Jurassic Park III

I thought that Jurassic Park 3 was a great movie, not just for the dinosaur lover, but for the whole family. Yes, it does have blood, and I understand that parents don't want their children seeing that type of stuff, but JPIII also has good humor to it. This film is a must see film for everyone, so before you go to see ""Planet of the Apes"" go and see ""Jurassic Park 3.""",Jurassic Park III

Theres no story for either, and its pure action.JP series has headed downward since its peak with the original, JP2 wasnt very good, and JP3 is just plain terrible. The story is laughable in its stupidity, and the acting throughout the film is consistantly bad except for Sam Neil's which is on par with his previous performance.I cant say stay away from this movie enough. It wasnt true to the original one bit and the plotline is absolutely rediculous. Youd think they would learn from the complete failure of JP2 but they didnt, and it shows.The ending is the worst part of all. Not only is it absolutely crazy, it has to be the dumbest ending for a movie that I have seen in a long while.

964,zilchous,Worse than Jaws IV,3,29 July 2001,"Unfortunatly, JP3 is a pretty routine attempt at a sequel.  With the exception of the Pterodactyls (which were pretty cool I must admit), all the ""new"" elements (talking raptors, the spinosaurus) were pretty lame.  I mean honestly, we're supposed to believe that raptors would ""take revenge"" on the humans for stealing the eggs???  Even the setting was lame.  Rather than running through the jungles of Isla Sorna (which has already been done in Lost World), wouldn't it be a lot cooler to go exploring through the wreck of the first island?Besides that, this movie had no atmosphere to it.  We were shipped off to the island five minutes into the movie, with no buildup or even an attempt at anything besides a vague attempt at a storyline.  And once we are on the island, the dinosaurs don't create any feelings for the viewers.  There is no sense of awe (as in the first film) or menace (as in The Lost World). Its just another movie monster, and for some reason the intangible magic that the first two films had is gone.Once the action begins it all takes place during DAYTIME too.  I read a previous comment on these message boards that said The Lost World left them feeling ""visually cheated"".  I thought the pacing and cinematography in that film created a very eerie, threatening effect that was missing in this film. Imagine the T-rex scene from the first film occuring during the day, and it would have much less of an impact.  The rain, the darkness, the dilating pupils of the T-rex...all these elements just made everything seem that much scarier and REAL.",Jurassic Park III

966,dhulk,"Worse than 1993,but better than 1997.",7,1 November 2006,"In my opinion the third Jurassic Park is not quite as good as the first one,but much better than the second. When I have heard of JP3 in 2001,I thought I must see that,because I was a large fan of the other two movies.As I read some comments and previews in magazines,I was worried about the film being not very good,too short and too pathetic. But since I saw it in winter 2001,I didn't think so. It's the JP movie with the most action,the most dinosaurs,with a not bad story and great pictures.The picture with the T-Rex and the spino or the scene with Grant and the raptors,I won't forget too fast. But let's start with the story.The story is simple(Boy got lost,parents search him with a few other people for example Dr.Grant,dinosaurs wanna eat them and they try to survive),but that doesn't mean that it's bad. The plane crash at the beginning of the film and the spinosaur attack is as good as the main-road scene from JP1. That the spino fights with the T-Rex an kills him is exaggerated,but you must see that the spino is bigger and has more powerful claws than the Rex,even if he could bite more wasteful.So it isn't too unrealistic. The skin of the raptors had changed,but i don't think that they now look worse or not as dangerous as before. That you can see the InGen constructions again,and see how run down they are,is very interesting.The cars and breeding places look the same as the ones in the first movie,but more dirty and broken. The pteranodons look kinda scary,I liked them,their flying style seems natural. Besides,the river scene with the spino is great and the raptors behave intelligent and understandable.One part of the people who have seen the film hate it,and the other part love it. I love it for being a great movie,and I think it's a must-see movie for fans of Jurassic Park,and a good film for people who like dinosaurs or simply want to be entertained. So watch it,cause it's worth.PS:Sorry for my English,but I'm German.",Jurassic Park III
967,sithmarsh,Disappointing,6,27 July 2001,"Spoiler Warning: If you haven't seen JP3 yet and want to be surprised, don't continue reading!This movie had several major flaws right from the start.  Throughout the entire movie, the characters were being chased by one dinosaur or another, with little else.  Dinosaur attacks are good and all, but a good movie needs some breaks in between for characters to develop, etc. You could tell that several characters were expendable from the start (i.e. the parasail operators and the mercenaries), which eliminated any surprise. In contrast, no main character died, even though two came close. The Spinosaurus, which was the main dino in the film, was poorly done, because it looked rather robotic.  It also seemed to go after the people relentlessly, which is cool if it's a smart dinosaur like the raptors, but the spino was big and dumb, and it could've gone after any other dinosaurs. There certainly wasn't any shortage of them.  Why is this dinosaur featured so prominantly in this film if it never appeared in The Lost World? The raptors got worse also.  They got smart and could make sophisticated noises though an air chamber of some sort.  At one scene, they appear to be carrying on a conversation as if they were cartoons.  They never had any really cool raptor surprises.  Twice, Grant was surrounded and twice he got away, the second time by blowing on a horn. On the brighter side, Grant got friendlier, while still giving the impression of a tough guy.  He even had a few funny lines in the movie. The Pteradactyl scene was awesome; it was great how the one was walking down the catwalk towards the kid in the mist.  They alone made the movie worth seeing on the big screen. See the movie in the theaters, but don't go shell out $20 for it when it comes out on tape/DVD.",Jurassic Park III

Trust me, the plot was not disappointing. The plot of the movie was very clever! I think it was a terrific idea. But there was one problem with the movie, though. In the first movie there was a lot of plot build up. I thought that helped make the movie more ""majestic.""  In the third movie there wasn't as much, but there was a lot. I thought that Steven Speilburgh should have shown the ""kind"" or herbivore dinosaurs for a longer period of time. It made the dinosaurs seem like a very majestic animal. In the third movie they seemed like dangerous man-eating monsters. But that's ok because that is the theme of all three movies.

Still had that sense of humor that the first and the second had. Wasn't a movie I would see more than once in the theater.  Would definately buy once it comes out on DVD.

From the opening scene it presents itself as a soulless, plotless piece of garbage simply meant to make lots of money.The special effects are far below the level of the original.  The directing is almost adolescent in its simplicity, and I do not mean that in a good way.  The ""plot"" and storyline are absolutely ludicrous, and that is before the characters show up.This is one of those movies that will irritate you because the characters are so unbelievably stupid in all of their actions.  The idiocy of the characters made any good points of the movie lost to me.The editing is quite pathetic as well.  I find it amazing the a thirty foot tall dinosaur that could most likely run in excess of thirty mph could go from being a few feet behind some slow running humans to a hundred feet behind whenever the picture changes.  Every scene that is not is sunlight is so obviously on a sound stage that everything that happens during the scene is unbelievable.

The special effects remain some of the most realistic I've seen and the acting was good.  As is usually the case with sequels, the quality dropped off considerably in The Lost World...and plummets to the bottom of the barrel in this third installment. Taken at face value, the dinosaur effects by Stan Winston were excellent. I only wish they had taken as much care with the script as they did with the effects.  I realize the dinosaurs are the stars but it would have been nice to have at least a plausible plot line.  I thought Sam Neil did an okay job as the lead.  William Macy is a terrific actor but the script didn't give him a whole lot to work with.  Tea Leone...well, I still wonder how in the world she can find work as an actress.  For me, the highlight of the film was the cameo by Laura Dern.  I enjoyed her role in the original and her brief appearance int JP3 was a very pleasant surprise.  At least she was smart enough to stay away from the island!!If you are satisfied with seeing some new and exciting dinosaurs and little else...you won't be let down.

983,Sirloinalot,An insult to fans of the two films.,1,31 October 2001,"I'll tell you this, never have I been to the theatre and seen such tripe. Joe Johnston should be hunted down and shot for how he has handled this, the third instalment of the popular and highly successful Jurassic Park franchise, such is the degree of sheer incompetence shown in this near unwatchable creation.The Plot, Story, acting, characterisation and dialogue were never anything more than just plain awful. The action sequences were far too short and extremely unimaginative (most are inferior and blatantly obvious carbon copy's of what we saw in the first two instalments). None had any form of tension, build up or suspense worthy of mentioning, and from start to finish were about as intense and scary as your average episode of 'Tom and Jerry'. The death scenes were (yawn) plain to say the least, not to mention predictable, and on *all but one* occasion took place completely out of view. Its was painfully obvious they aiming towards the younger audiences this time around, the film even had ""Barney"" (the pink dinosaur) thrown in to boot.The Visual effects were nothing special either. Certainly NOT on par with what we saw in the first two `groundbreaking' instalments. Some of the CGI shots in particular (e.g. 'Brachiosaurs on the bank', and this goofy looking Red thing we see near the end) looked so cheap they could quite easily be confused with something that was done using clay models and 'stop-motion' techniques. Worse still was the animatronics. The way they moved, the way they acted, the way they were presented, they seemed generations behind what we saw in the first film and certainly the second. You knew instantly that you were watching a puppet with foam rubber for skin, the very second it appeared on the screen. Joe Johnston simply could not convince me that the puppets were real dinosaurs the way Spielberg did, and thus, throughout the film, the awe, the majesty and the belief that dinosaurs were alive on this ""distant island"" was totally lost.On a lighter note however, at least this films utter hideousness has allowed a great many people to see Steven Spielberg's 'The Lost World' for just how underrated it truly was.My final score - 1/10 (Just for the record, I gave both JP and TLW 9/10)",Jurassic Park III

This film is even sub par in its entertainment value, even in a sequel sense.

985,therealjpus,"Not as bad as many people made it out to be, it's actually allot worse",1,6 December 2001,"I was warned by many of my friends about this film. They knew that I was a huge Jurassic park fan, so much so that I have the movie posters of both Jurassic Park and The Lost World Framed and hanging up in my apartment.  In My opinion, Jurassic Park is probably one of the greatest films ever made; and while The Lost World Was not as good, It's still a great film in it's own right.  So when my friends told me that Jurassic Park 3 was a real letdown, I was shocked. What was so bad about Big Dinosaurs walking the landscape of a forbidden world? On top of, one of my favorite actors around was coming back into the fold. I have been a fan of Sam Neil since he was in the movie Dead Calm, and he was really cool in the first Jurassic Park. I was overjoyed when I heard that he was coming back in Jurassic Park 3. I told my friends that no matter what they said, I still will enjoy the movie for the sheer fact that I'm not expecting it to be better than the first movie, but I expect it to be fun film none the less. Of course they laughed at me and said that I was warned. So I then went to see it, and words really can't express the feelings I felt when I was watching this movie. This was a really bad film. I could not believe my eyes; they took everything that made the first two movies special and literally flushes it down the toilet.  Everything that could go wrong in a film went wrong in this film. The story is nothing more than a really bad joke. It's like they were making things up when they were going alone. This movie makes no sense what so ever, and it's not ashamed to even admit it. It's like the filmmakers did not care what they were making; they only cared about making a fast buck. The sad thing about it is the fact that the quality of this movie is so bad that it should have gone straight to video. The cast in general is not that good. Sam Neil is one of my favored actors but I do question his decision on even agreeing to come back to a movie that almost has no script. He is ok but his character has none of the flare or charm that made him so good in the first one. He comes a cross as a grumpy old man, and during the course of the movie, he becomes sort of annoying. At least Jeff Goldblum Made you laugh during the first two films, and at least kept his coolness. I think Sam knows that he sold himself and the franchise out by just taking the money, and it shows by his performance. Unfortunately, His performance is the best in the film, compared to William H Macy and Tea Leoni.  William H Macy Is another great actor, but like Sam; he phones in his performance. His character is suppose to be the comic relief of the film but just ends up more like an idiot.  Tea Leoni is another good actor stuck in a really bad part.  She just comes a cross as a mother with no common senses what so ever. I don't know about the special effects but it really does not hold a candle to the first two movies. It supposed to have more effects shots than the others but it in my opinion, it did not. The Spinosauris is really nothing to brag about, and does not have the menace or the presence of the T-rex's. The only decent scene in the whole movie is the bird cage scene, and that alone can't save this movie. The ending is down right disturbing, because there is really no end. It just came to a stop with no explanation what so ever. It's offensive because it does not have a climax and judging by the lack of story anyway, it's clear that the film makers just ran out of ideas.While The Lost World Did not have some of the magic of the original, it still retains its sense of wonder, and it was fun and scary. Jurassic Park 3 is neither of those things, it's more of a big screen version of a Saturday morning cartoon; and a bad one to boot. To sum it up, it's one of the worst films I have seen in a very long time. It's a real shame because I really loved the first two Jurassic Park movies but this one is just too ridiculous to even take seriously.  It's not even a real sequel; it's just a sad excuse to make money.  If this is the future of the series, then they just turned off another fan from seeing the next one.",Jurassic Park III

First off, This is not even based on anything written by Michael Crichton and it shows by the lack of any real story or substances. Second, Nether Steven Spielberg or Jeff Goldblum is involved, and it shows by the amateur directing and the lack of depth. Spielberg knew how to spotlight the wonder and power of these wonderful creatures, and Goldblum gave the films it's intelligence and it's heart. Unfortunately, this movie does not benefit from ether of them. And it suffers greatly because of it. Sam Neil Returns as Alan Grant Who is trick this time around into looking for a missing kid who has crashed landed on the Island Sorna (Setting of The Lost World) And instead ends up trap on the island with the parents trying to get off the island. Now this would have worked if there were more to the story than that but unfortunately there is not, and it does not even try to be anything other than that. The whole discussion about The danger of playing god is tossed out for a run in the mill monster movie that has no brains or heart. Sam Neil is a very good actor but his character reminds us on why Jeff Goldblum character is so important to the series. One hint, Goldblum's character had brains, and a sense of humor. Sam Neil's Character has nether. If he did, he would have had the parents of the missing kid checked out before he agreed to go with them on the island. The parents of the missing kid are in fact so dumb, and so annoying that you end up wishing that they would be eaten by the dinosaurs, as for the screen writers and the director of the abomination of a film. There is barely any mention of the first two films, and the story does not even make any lead way into trying to connect it's self to those movies.  It does not even make sense in some aspects of the story, like how the Spinosauris even got on the island in the first place. It was not in The Lost World, so why is it in this one? At The End Of The Lost World, The military was surrounding the island because they did not want the Dinosaurs to go to the mainland, so where aren't they surrounding the island now? All of this and the quality of it make this the most pointless and useless film of this series. It seems like the makers of this film did not even try to make a good film, they just expected people to just swallow it, with out thinking on what they were seeing.  That is a really sad because it taints the magic of the extremely better first two movies.My advice Rent The first Two Films film of this series instead of wasting your time with this one.P.S.

I am surprised anyone can write positive comments about this movie that has no plot, no character development whatsoever and relies solely on special effects, and even those are not very good. In addition the movie is totally unrealistic. Not that having dinosaurs running around is very believable, but at least on the first movie of the sequel there was an attempt to explain rationally and scientifically what was happening (i.e: how the dinosaurs were created) and that kept the movie interesting at different levels. All of that is gone on the third movie and we are left with a bunch of carnivorous dinosaurs (the ""vegetarians"" are only shown briefly at the end of the movie) set on eating humans (despite the large preys that lay dead at their ""pawtips"") and pursuing the main characters during the entire movie -the remaining humans that is since half the cast dies within the first half an hour. The dinosaurs are clearly more intelligent than the human counterparts (which is not that surprising given how stupid the characters are) and set traps for them to which humans succumb (instead of the other way around). Fortunately they are saved from some perils by a 12 year old (the one who was supposed to be rescued) who has managed to live unfazed on this hostile environment where half a dozen ""commando style dudes"" armed to the teeth have been killed on the first few hours after setting foot on the island (someone explain THAT to me??!!!). To top the chart of ridiculous situations we have a paleobotanist of a God forsaken university who manages to mobilize the entire US air-force in a matter of hours. In sum, among the worst movies I have ever seen if not the WORST. I had never seen such a steady stream of people leaving the movie theater half-way through the story.

The Movie lacks any real depth, and it really does not have a story. It just has very stupid characters running around, and making fools of themselves. Sam Neil (Who was in the first one) does not have the charm and wit of Jeff Goldblum, and really does not add anything to this flimsy movie other than a reminder of how unnecessary it was to bring back his character.

995,rick_cross,Jurassic Park III,5,27 January 2002,"I find it difficult to believe that anyone thought this film better than the original.  The plot can be described as nothing more than an afterthought, the special effects still don't come anywhere near the BBC's ""Walking with Dinosaurs"" (made for a fraction of the cost) and the whole thing lasts just 80 minutes (not including the end credits).And the ""main attraction"" which I think was the invention of the SFX department was a huge disappointment.  Its movements were completely unnatural and it was easy to tell when they were using computer generated effects and when they were using a large puppet dinosaur.
---Possible Spoiler Alert--- And they clearly had problems with the lifesize model, because in the final scene, the head of this dinosaur sways about as if it has been dosed up with sedatives.  It really looks quite absurd!! ---End of Possible Spoiler Alert---What was even more annoying were the blatant plot holes.  Yes, I know action films always have holes in the plot, but they're normally concealed in some way, or the action moves at a pace that doesn't give time for you to think about them.  You can see they're trying to get your pulse up, but every supposedly frantic scene holds no tension whatsoever.  The main reason for this is that you just don't care about the characters because not one of them is in the least bit likeable.  By the end of the film, I was hoping that they would all be eaten!And the ending is just so dumb and over-the-top (and completely contradicts something you've been told all the way through the movie), my wife and I were in disbelief!I know the first two films have their flaws, but to me they stand head and shoulders above this version, possibly the mark of being directed by a real director and not just a special effects technician.",Jurassic Park III

Sam Neil tries his best to work with out a script or a director in this feeble follow up, and still falls flat on his face. He's a good actor but it's clear from the get go that there was no reason to bring back his character, and the way his character is drawn back to the island proves that. It's more contrived than reasonable, and the cast of characters that he is suck with only proves that the writers of this mess had no idea what they were doing. William H Macy, who is a brilliant actor, is annoying, and Tea Leoni is equally as bad. You actually want them to get eaten but the dinosaurs, and in fact want the dinosaurs to get the rest of the people who worked on this movie. The Special Effects are not as good as the others, and the story lacks a climax. The Lost World was not as good as the original, but at least it's a good follow up.

Of course their son has became lost on one of the scary dinosaur islands from the JP mythos.Sam Neil returns as Dr. Grant and is tricked into journeying to the island to save the couples son. What follows is basically a series of scenes that finds the group(Sam Neil, the divorced couple learning to love each other again, the couples son, and the heroic 'cute guy') running from dinosaurs. Cliches are everywhere and you have to love when Laura Dern figures out Sam Neil's characters exact location, and what's going on, from a phone call. She even manages to bring the marines!! Also the subplot with the raptors was totally stupid. On a more positive note the special effects were great.
I have to say that JP3 was an average movie. It has some good moments (like the pterasaur cage) and some bad ones (they've taken the raptor intelligence thing WAY too far).Of course it is far superior to that mess that was The Lost World.",Jurassic Park III

In My opinion, Jurassic Park is probably one of the greatest films ever made; and while The Lost World was not as good, It's still a great film in it's own right. I did not have the time to catch this in the theater when it was released but promised myself to see it when it hit video. So when my friends told me that Jurassic Park 3 was a real letdown, I was shocked. What was so bad about Big Dinosaurs walking the landscape of a forbidden world? On top of, one of my favorite actors around was coming back into the fold. I have been a fan of Sam Neil since he was in the movie Dead Calm, and he was really cool in the first Jurassic Park. I was overjoyed when I heard that he was coming back in Jurassic Park 3. I told my friends that no matter what they said, I still will enjoy the movie for the sheer fact that I'm not expecting it to be better than the first movie, but I expect it to be fun film none the less. Of course they laughed at me and said that I was warned. So I rented it, and words really can't express the feelings I felt when I was watching this movie. This was horrible.The cast in general is not that good. Sam Neil is one of my favored actors but I do question his decision on even agreeing to come back to a movie that almost has no script.

I'm convinced that Jeff Goldblum deliberately injured his leg so he could avoid being in this movie.I won't detail every ridiculous scene because there are too many, but I'll summarize enough to make my point.The biggest problem I have is that the parents who effectively kidnap Dr Grant not only survive, thereby not being punished for their stupidity and self-importance which cause three deaths to save one life, but they recover their son and find love again with each other (never mind the fact that the mother just lost her boyfriend (husband?) and was face-to-face with his rotting corpse with no seeming mental distress).In one scene the middle-aged, out-of-shape (thin != world-class sprinters) parents and scientist are fleeing from velociraptors (escaping from one would be silly enough, but escaping from many is beyond ridiculous) and manage to outrun them and run into a herd of presumably herbivore dinosaurs that are about the size of elephants. Upon seeing the velociraptors the herbivores begin stampeding and bumping into each other, but somehow neither trample the humans nor crush them between each other.The 12-year old child apparently survives eight weeks alone on the island having previously read a few books about dinosaurs (making him an expert on dinosaur hunting tactics) and later survives a pterodactyl attack and pursuit of it's young which were roughly the size of a 12-year old human, but with presumably better killing skills. Then when the 20-something model/paleontologist is attacked by 2-3 adult pterodactyls not only does he survive, but he is apparently able to swim far enough from the island to find US troops AND convince them to amass a small force to storm the beach to save the Dr and the delusional parents and spoiled child.Look out Plan 9 from Outerspace – your crown is being threatened.FWIW it's not a ""suspension of disbelief"" thing because I own over 400 movies many of which are scientifically improbable and some of which are scientifically impossible, but this movie is more outrageous than Angelina Jolie having the strength to fling a fired bullet faster than the earth spins (Wanted, if you don't get that reference).And before the fans of this movie jump on me: I may have missed a few minor details that explain some of the things about which I'm complaining because I was working on a computer while 'watching' it, but I didn't miss enough details to take my 1 * rating to a 10.",Jurassic Park III

The plot in itself is very simple, but I'm very happy about that because who wants a movie about dinosaurs where people are talking on serious issues?  If some people need complex plots which can be cool sometimes, then movies like Jurassic Park or any action movie are not the movies to pick.  This is meant to be a fun movie full of thrills and action, and it delivers.I have seen this movie about 5 times and it's still exciting everytime I watch it.

There are so many stupid things about this film it's mind boggling!! I remember when i went to see JP as a kid it was my favorite movie and franchise, the acting, the SFX the Music, the direction! all fantastic, JP2 in my opinion was OK pretty much the same apart from some really stupid moments (like the gymnast girl kicking a raptor..please!) but on a whole a watchable and reasonable cinematic experience.But the the third one has no point!! It's supposed to be a sequel that Carry's on from JP2 and yet it magically includes brand new things to the franchise that would have been impossible to miss on the previous 2 films! for example: 1) The ""new"" mega Spinosaurus - Seriously, what the hell!! This thing follows them everywhere they go, they cannot escape it's presence and yet in The lost world (the same island) do you see it once? do you hear it? does anyone even MENTION it? NO! Its ridiculous!. The star character in the previous 2 movies was, and always will be the T-Rex so what does the d(urr)irector ""Joe Johnston"" go and do? Kill it off! as soon as you see the huge T-Rex in all its awesome roaring glory it gets killed and you never see it again - a new Dino on the town is the excuse.. where did it come from!!?? not a single explanation! and don't get me started on the whole satellite-phone-in-the-Dino-belly thing! 2)Just when you start to get over how stupid the Spinosaurus is you see the Raptors, Aside from their new ""Punk"" Haircuts they seem pretty credible! *Phew* they will make this movie watchable right?... WRONG! now they speak to each other!! and the excuse for them speaking in this film and not in the First and second are...wait for it... Evolution! - yes the process of millions of years in just a few months from when the second movie ended, amazing! surly they should have grown opposable thumbs and created tools by now!! OK i am not going to say anymore about the plot because it's getting up my nose, so i will close on this: Jurassic Park is a classic, JP3 is a lousy sucker punch to any of the original fans of the series, my favorite franchise was well and truly dead after watching this Monstrosity (no pun intended) Avoid this movie like the plague",Jurassic Park III
1016,todd_blosser2002,Character Assassination,1,12 December 2013,"Jurassic Park the original movie spent a lot of time developing the characters of Dr. Alan Grant and Dr. Ellie Sattler, throughout the entire movie we watched Dr. Grant transform from a man who feared and disliked kids and not wanting anything to do with them, to a man who would make a wonderful father and mentor of kids. Dr. Grant's character grew as a person right before our eyes, and the natural progression of his character would be to marry Dr. Ellie Sattler and have kids of their own. Instead Jurassic Park 3 had Dr. Grant unmarried and alone, and visiting Dr. Sattler and her family, husband and kids... Dr. Grant character development in the original movie was all for nothing, he had not grown at all as a person, in fact he even lost Dr. Sattler to another man... Dr. Grant again in Jurassic park 3 faced with mentoring another kid Erick Kirby he takes to it like a champ. Dr. Grant again shows that he would be a great father. Dr. Grant our Jurassic park hero that we all love has not grown as a person at all... very disheartening and disappointing. They could have made the same movie, with Dr. Grant and Dr. Sattler married with kids living in that big house, as a family. Dr. Grant's character development would have been complete and come full circle tying the first movie and the third movie together much better and at the end of the movie it would be his wife that saves the day. The character assassination of Dr. Grant was written by these idiots, Peter Buchman, Alexander Payne and Jim Taylor and this train wreck of character development was directed by Michael Crichton, and together they took our hero Dr. Grant and made him the biggest loser of them all... Other than destroying the foundation of the first movie and character assassinating Dr. Grant and Dr. Sattler, the rest of the movie was great, it had dinosaurs in it!",Jurassic Park III
1017,tombowright11,Way better then everyone makes out,9,17 May 2019,Not sure why this film gets such bad reviews. It's 10 times better then any of the Jurassic World Series and steps all over the boring second film! CGI is a step up from the second film! Very harsh reviews,Jurassic Park III
1018,preciousgyal_90,Best of the three JP films.,10,10 June 2004,"I have just seen the ITV premiere last night, after seeing this film 3 times at the cinema a while ago. I think this film is the best of the three, it includes my favourite characters such as Billie and Dr Grant, and the story line is well written. I also think the type of dinosaurs used is good and the first time i saw the film i was wrong a lot of th times i tried to guess what was going to happen. Basically I think the film is great, it is one of my favourite films and even if you didn't like the first film and the lost world, i would watch it because although the 3 films come under the same title, they are all quite different. I'm not a big fan of dinosaurs myself but the film is amazing.",Jurassic Park III
1019,lovely_angel559,Ruined the first movie for me,7,13 August 2005,I rate this a 7 because the movie ruined the first movie for me. At the end of the first movie they show that Dr. Grant and Ellie have resolved their issues about children and leave you with that one positive thing. In the third movie they show that Ellie has married and had children with someone else and Dr. Grant is still alone. They also show her looking at him and she obviously still feels for him. Therefore ruining the idea that they had grown closer through this perilous adventure. Which to me was a huge disappointment to find out they had separated. He over came his problem with children so what ruined it? And what is Dr. Grant supposed to do seeing as he is still hung up on this woman. I am a sucker for a happy ending but when it comes down to it this man is not taken seriously professionally anymore and has no family and goes through hell twice. I mean yeah Ellie has children and a husband but that has to be painful to have to see someone you love(d) and all of that and not be able to be with them. I cried over the fact that Dr. Grant ends up alone and without a family and Ellie has her family but obviously still feels something for him.,Jurassic Park III

1021,Finbar-woolnough,A heart-shatteringly devastating tale of a trilogy that was ruined by the third film.,3,16 October 2012,"We all have distinctive moments in our pasts where we remember being truly terrified for the first time, and mine can be summed up in two words; Velociraptors. Kitchen. To date Jurassic Park remains my favourite movie of all time, no questions asked. The sequel? Flawed, yet brilliant, replacing the serious, moody Sam Neil with Jeff Goldblums' goofy, pessimistic Ian Malcolm and introducing INGEN as more of a relentlessly capitalistic corporation than just John Hammond and his smug-yet-blundering team of scientists meant that The Lost World was far enough removed from the original to lean more towards the action genre than the sci-fi/horror that came before, successfully expanding on a fantastic idea. Now, at some point I'm going to have to mention the film in question, as much as it pains me, so here goes.It's laughable. By now the entire planet knows about the Park, yet no government organisation has made any attempts to do anything about, no INGENesque investors have attempted to profit from the islands, the world has conveniently forgotten all about it (conveniently allowing the standard foolish tourists that such second-rate, they're-coming-to-get- you films need, access to a large collection of assorted predators). While a film about a theme park full of genetically engineered dinosaurs is not exactly what you'd call realistic, the idea that the world would do nothing about it is not ridiculous, it's just bloody stupid.So where next? Well, we've done a T-rex, a spitty-thing and 3 Raptors (JP1) We've done 2 T-rexes, a baby T-rex, a pack of Raptors in the long grass and these weird, tiny little dinosaurs who you could blatantly smash to pieces with a small stick, yet still manage to eat the bad guy from The Big Lebowski (JP2)... Oh! I know we'll bring in this BIG dude to ruin the t-rex's party, introduce the Pterosaur cage from the first book, and lets give the raptors their own language -therefore enhancing their level of evil- make them smaller and give them a few feathers!! Even though they're allegedly the same as the animals in JP2. And Dr. Grant also mentions in the movie how the Spinosaurus was not on InGen's list of dinosaurs, it was a top secret experiment that was hidden from the public (convenient!).So as we have established, this is a film built on a relic of an amazing idea for a film, it hurts me personally to know that because of it two of my favourite films will never join the great trilogies of my generation, and if the rant above doesn't dissuade you from wasting your time on this lurching Frankenstein, then maybe this will; It is an admirable goal and a daunting task to try and emulate the work of a great director like Spielberg, and in no way does any aspect of this film match up to what has gone before it, but not only that, it also makes no attempts to expand any more than JP2 already did, it lacks creativity, the acting is poor -the return of Sam Neil does nothing to draw the viewer away from the awfully-stereotypical drone of the hired guns there to supply a bit of fodder for the dinos- and the climax of the film is -quite frankly- a bit of an anticlimax. All in all I would rather this film be scrubbed from the annals of history and the whisper of its very name made punishable by death. The worst part? They're bringing out another one.",Jurassic Park III
1022,pete_chosen,Under-appreciated Sequel,8,6 May 2005,"I realize I am in a distinct minority on this one, but I thought JPIII was vastly superior to JP:LTW and different but comparable to the original JP.The original JP mostly succeeded on the remarkable special effects, which, at that time particularly, were amazing. By the time of JPIII, CGI was completely run of the mill. If the original had not been fueled by the ""Gee Whiz"" factor of the newness of the technology, its own plot problems and character issues would have been more apparent. This is not to criticize JPI - I liked it a lot - just to put some perspective on it. I do think that JPI did something pretty impressive - it actually improved on a fairly weak book. The original JP book was a great idea masquerading as a story - the movie actually fleshed it out nicely.JP:LTW was a fairly wretched waste of celluloid. Horrible, silly, annoying characters, a nonsensical plot, poorly manufactured suspense. JP:LTW really was about as bad a sequel can be. This was particularly troubling because Crichton's book ""The Lost World"" - which predated the movie - is a spectacular improvement over JPI. Unfortunately, the filmmakers took the title of Crichton's book and none of its gripping story. This movie not only fails on its own, but fails massively when compared to the material they had in front of them - material which would have made a great movie if they would have simply followed it.JPIII, coming after the pathetic LTW, had nowhere to go but up. The filmmakers clearly saw the excesses and failures of LTW and decided to solve them by stripping the story down to an adventure yarn. This is somewhat similar to what the filmmakers later did in Terminator 3 to similarly successful effect. They toss in some new cool dinos - finally getting us the pterodactyls from the original JP book - and tell a very simple story very well. JPIII is not a great movie but it holds together well and ultimately makes sense - two points which were sorely lacking in LTW. In fact, after LTW I expected nothing from JPIII and I was pleasantly surprised at the vast improvement.Because of the watchability of JPIII, I have some hope that ultimately JPIV will be equally watchable. Tell a decent adventure story, spiced with some cool (if dubious) science and it could work. Hopefully they will keep everyone involved with LTW away from it and it will develop from the teams that did JPI and JPIII.",Jurassic Park III
1023,runningriotx5,"Not the best plot, but filled in the holes from The Lost World",7,17 October 2013,"The characters went to several locations that the characters in TLW went to, such as the giant hatchery, visited in the second novel. That and many other areas weren't shown in the second movie. This also showed the dinosaurs unmentioned in The Lost World, like Ceratosaurus, Spinosaurus, and the Pteranodons. I felt the entire basis of the movie was on just rescuing a person, but didn't seen as luring as JP and TLW. This didn't have the best story but had many interesting concepts. They should have shown what happened to Ian Malcom. They also could have shown what happened to InGen. I hope Jurassic World fills in the holes from before Jurassic Park, the future of InGen, and the dinosaurs' fates.",Jurassic Park III
1024,jimmycheung1990,Quite good but a little short,8,23 February 2005,"I think this is a good movie for a few reasons. The first one is the the plot of the movie is interesting. The story about the creating of dinosaurs and the tourist attraction, Jurassic Park is a very new and interesting idea. The point of using genetic engineering to make dinosaurs is interesting. I think this may be a possible way to make dinosaurs in real life. The second reason that I like the movie is the events in it are very exciting.For example, when the plane that Dr. Grant took wanted to leave the island Sorna, the spinosaurus, a kind of dinosaurs which is bigger and more fierce than tyrannosaurus Rex, appeared and stood on the runway. The plane bottom flew into the back of the spinosaurous and crashed into the jungle. The spinosaurous followed them into the jungle and wanted to eat them. Then they met a Tyrannosaurus Rex when they were escaping from the spinosaurous.The two dinosaurs fought together and Dr. Grant leaded them ran away under the fighting. One of the other exciting parts is the student of Dr. Grant, Billy, who has also came with them, stole two of the velociraptors' egg's so the velociraptors surrounded them for getting back the eggs. At last Dr.Grant used a tool to pretend the sound of velociraptors and made them left. One more reason that I like the movie is the sight and sound effects. The movie had done a very good job on these and these made me feel very exciting. The roaring of the spinosaurous, the scary sound of the velociraptors, the skin of the Dinosaurs and some others also seemed real. If the full mark is ten, I will give this movie eight as it is a little bit short. Anyway it is still worth us a watch.",Jurassic Park III
1025,slipout2345,Jurassic Crap.,1,11 August 2015,"Useless entry in the Jurassic Park series lacks not only the showmanship, characterization  and excitement of it's predecessors (The original Jurassic Park and it's fun and worthy sequel The Lost World) but it's not even as good as the bloated mess that that followed it (Jurassic World). Jurassic Park 3 earns it's reputation ten fold as one of the most useless, unnecessary sequels ever made and I can see why it almost ended the series. The acting is terrible, the setting does not even look like the Site B of the last film (The Lost World) and the story is so thin that it's does not even warrant the 90 minute run time which is way to short for a Jurassic Park film. When a SyFy movie of the week has better production values and better acting, you know you have a really bad movie on your hands. Avoid. Stick with Jurassic Park and The Lost World. Even Jurassic World was better than this( But only worth a rental)",Jurassic Park III
1026,absolutsugarpuss,it was decent until the end.,4,28 April 2005,"i was surprised that i didn't completely hate this movie; i still believe jurassic park didn't need a sequel at all, and now there's a fourth one coming.however, i did like the film, for the most part. the dinosaurs lived up to their animatronic expectations and i think they made the movie as realistically as it could have been made.but the ending SQUASHED all of the rest of the movie like a bug. okay; we all knew dr. grant would call ellie to save the day, or at least most of us figured that out pretty early on. but how the hell does ellie, a paleobotanist, have the authority to literally send in a huge staff of marines and the navy to save everyone on the island within MINUTES of her receiving a virtually unintelligible phone call from allen? you don't call the NAVY all, ""my ex and some folks are trapped on an island full of DINOSAURS, send EVERYONE right NOW"" and get away with it, at least not without something in the plot to back up her authority to do anything even remotely like that.so, in short, if you skip the last five minutes, it's an all right flick.",Jurassic Park III

1029,stupendousrex,Worst Jurassic Park movie.,5,27 December 2015,"This movie is the worst Jurassic Park movie. I don't recommend you watching it unless you must. The plot is awful, the characters are poorly written and it's too short. 90 minutes? Look at the first two movies. They were 160 minutes. The best part about this movie is Alan Grant, but he seemed to be bored when they were filming. Is like he didn't want to be in this movie. We also have Billy, a lame character who doesn't really do much. And there is the annoying family: The Kirbys. Amanda Kirby was the worst character of the movie. No, even worse. Of the franchise. All she did was to scream ""BEN! ERIC"". And of course, they introduced us to a new dinosaur: the Spinosaurus, portrayed in an awkward animatronic and CGI. When I was a kid and I saw this dinosaur, I knew I wasn't going to like it. All it did was to chase Grant and the others. This movie was so unnecessary. We had TLW which is a great sequel and Universal wanted another one for some reason. Joe Johnston, the director of this movie, did a terrible job. I also like the fact that in a pod cast they actually said that it will be original. It was not. It was a cheap copy of The Lost World. Being a Jurassic Park fan, I wanted to like this movie. I watched 20 times,trying to figure out why I didn't like it. It's bad, that's why. A weak sequel. But hey, at least Jurassic World was a better movie and it didn't let the franchise end like this. This movie represents the Phantom Menace of the Jurassic Park franchise.",Jurassic Park III
1030,Little_Young_,Lack Of Action,5,28 August 2005,"Jurassic Park 3 is a good sequel of JP, but there is a problem, lack of action , on JP2 we see a organize group of mercenaries sent to capture dinosaurs on these sequel of JP we see the use of weapons , survival , running and shooting, armored transportation and technology, but in JP3 the only good fact, that would attract people to see this movie is Dr. Allan Grant , but the movie is missing a lot of action i mean common only 3 mercenaries , 2 of than kill on the instant action , a kid that survives 2 months in a jungle like this i hope JP4 which is a work in process, be better more action more like a Dino Crisis Style.JP3 could it be better if more action were put on the movie, different story and a whole cast of all the others old school JP characters , but still the movie gets a average score, i hope Steven spielberg put his magic of action on JP4.",Jurassic Park III
1031,rlguffey,Throw out basic laws of ecology here.,2,13 August 2005,Does nobody see the obvious fallacies in the movies but me? All three movies take place on small islands yet the islands support huge herds of sauropods and predators. Ecologically this is absolutely impossible. Various real scientists have estimated the home range of a T rex at over 700 square miles yet here we have breeding populations of them and other predators. The sauropods populations would quickly denude the forest but here they seem to never run out of food. Neither Cricton nor Spielberg can change basic laws of science that govern biomass production and the energy pyramid. I suppose this all shows the scientific illiteracy of this country. The best science fiction is believable so where does this fit in?,Jurassic Park III
1032,pete-545,Absolutely horrendous...,1,19 August 2005,"OK, the second one was bad enough, this takes the cake. Raptors, yes we get fierce creatures of old. Now I'll go a long with the whole preposterous fantasy of bringing dinosaurs to life once again. Whatever it's a movie. This takes nature and tells everyone that it's a horrible place to exist in. Perhaps Michael Crichton had a bad experience camping or at the zoo. First dinosaurs are mindless killers. Next they're obsessive compulsives with a penchant for human flesh. The people in the movie are approximately the size of baby bunny would be to me. I've seen the island, there's plenty of food. Why are they going to huge lengths to eat these FIVE people? OK so one guys stole some eggs. So the raptors are in search their lost young. Isn't that nice. But these apparently ferocious creatures are scared off by smoke canisters? And hey when do 14 year olds become commando and crocodile dundee all rolled up into one? A 14 yr old that can survive in a jungle WITH dinosaurs for 8 weeks. Not going to happen. This movie fails in every way imaginable. Indestructible satellite phones (I can barely get my cell phone to work), para military crap everywhere and a narrow way out at the last possible second every single time. Falling 50 feet from atop a crane into water... that's not going to hurt? Oh I forgot, William H Macy is Arnold Schwarzenegger. There's nothing plausible in this movie whatsoever save one thing. it's under 90 minutes. It's no wonder it stayed wrapped in it's plastic until today. Stay away from this movie.

1037,zstephens-40845,"'Jurassic Park III' Film Review: Third, Final Instalment Is Pure Dino-Dung!",5,17 October 2018,"'Jurassic Park III' is visually catastrophic and narratively inept, indicating the extinction of a once mesmerizing franchise! Deceived by wealthy couple Paul and Amanda Kirby, (William H. Macy and Téa Leoni), palaeontologist Dr. Alan Grant, (Sam Neill) negotiates an aerial tour of Isla Sorna and requests funding for his Velociraptor research. Billy Brennan, (Alessandro Nivola) and three mercenaries, provide desired assistance, as the voyage to the uncharted island of Site B is daunting. An unspecified landing, results in the destruction of their aircraft by a ferocious Spinosaurus. The Kirby's acknowledge that their adolescent son Erik, (Trevor Morgan) is deserted on the island, after a ghastly paragliding incident. Imprisoned on Isla Sorna, Dr. Grant escorts his companions on a prolonged trek to shore. An intimidating Spinosaurus and an intelligent herd of Velociraptors, threaten their chance of survival.Boring dinosaur pursuits, insufferable dialogue and tedious characters alter a once exhilarating franchise to a dead standstill. 'Jurassic Park III' is an eighty-minute wild-goose chase, on an island inhabited by appallingly rendered CG dinosaurs. The inferior animatronics is noticeable when viewing all dinosaurs (the Spinosaurus in particular). The previous two instalments possessed exceptional authenticity in the artistic design of the dinosaurs, blending CG and animatronics seamlessly. The effects in this movie were theme park worthy and impacted the believability of the film. The 1993 phenomenon is a visual masterpiece compared to the grotty effects of the third chapter!Audiences must endure Téa Leoni's exasperating performance as Amanda Kirby, who single-mindedly attracts the likes of a Spinosaurus. In an attempt to locate the whereabouts of her son, Amanda continuously screeches his name, not realising that she is enticing several bloodthirsty dinosaurs. Common intellect suggests that shrieking amidst a jungle of dinosaurs, isn't the niftiest idea. Amanda Kirby shrieks, groans and sobs, therefore would advise you to ignore her character altogether. My satisfaction levels would've increased if the Spinosaurus had devoured her whole! Nonetheless, Sam Neill rejuvenates the mood, by delivering a convincing performance as Dr. Alan Grant. Neill's charisma and intelligence is a sigh of relief, considering the picture's deplorable character study. Laura Dern, a competent actress, gives a brief, unnecessary appearance as Dr. Ellie Sattler. Talent is present in the film, yet is dreadfully misused.A few amusing action sequences attracts wanted attention, in a fairly lacklustre film. I can recall several terrifying dinosaur ordeals that were surprisingly pleasurable. The aviary scene in which a group of Pteranodons attack Grant and his associates was well-structured and thrilling. Amidst the uninspired script and ghastly CG there is a clear vision regarding the set pieces and spectacle of the picture. Too bad the visuals are atrocious, as the action is written with a high level of expertise.'Jurassic Park III' miserably fails in providing a visually stimulating blockbuster. The characters aimlessly meander on Isla Sorna, dodging a gigantic Spinosaurus and shrieking to the point of exasperation. Director Joe Johnson has literally created pure dino-dung that dishonours Steven Spielberg's past ingenious efforts.",Jurassic Park III
