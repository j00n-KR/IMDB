0,SnoopyStyle,Earnest After School Special,7,20 March 2014,"Successful sporting goods store owner Ken Carter (Samuel L. Jackson) accepts the basketball coach job from his mentor at his old high school. It's a poor underachieving school. He forces his kids to sign a contract to maintain academics. He calls the kids 'sir' as a sign of respect. It's a struggle with the kids, but it's even more of a struggle with the adults. It climaxes to a point where coach Carter locks out the players when they don't maintain their academics.This is all a very earnest after school special. Coach Carter is a saint beyond reproach. The thing that I wish for is an early ally for Carter. It seems that everybody especially the adults are piling on. Even if true, it doesn't make for a compelling story. It's overkill. An ally could create more complex relationships in the adults of the movie.The other thing I noticed is that the movie reaches its climax around the lockout. The games after the lockout don't have much drama. The movie is about the lockout, not about any championships or game winners.",Coach Carter
1,Prismark10,Hoop dreams for the Oilers,7,10 December 2013,"Coach Carter is based on a true story of Richmond High School basketball coach Ken Carter (Samuel L Jackson) who made headlines in 1999 for benching his high school basketball team due to poor academic results.The film is not really about basketball that is just a backdrop. It is more about Ken Carter who becomes head coach of his old high school, where the players are rude, disrespectful and ill disciplined.Carter makes them each sign a personal contract regarding training, discipline, attendance and school grades. Although a disciplinarian the team has an unbeaten run and turns around the lives of their players even though some in the school and many of the parents are unhappy with his methods.I guess I would loath to have Ken Carter as my coach but in this movie with its assortment of High school misfits that are straight out of ghetto casting, it works.Samuel L Jackson has enough charisma and likability for you to invest in his character. The film is enjoyable enough, the music blends well with the urban drama and there are a few future stars in early roles in this film.",Coach Carter
2,classicsoncall,"""Rich what? Richmond!""",7,4 June 2019,"It was gratifying to watch a picture in which a black man takes a group of young teens to task for their casual use of the 'N' word, and instruct them in the value of an education to escape their poverty and unfulfilling family lives. This was made over a decade ago and things weren't as turbulent yet, but if Samuel L. Jackson came out with the same sentiments today, he'd be raked over the coals by the political correctness police. Sad, because speaking the truth about something causes an uproar in the media and gets the Twitter gang going full force, and Jackson would have to defend himself against being an Uncle Tom, or be forced to walk it back under the pretense of being sorry he offended anyone. You know the drill.Regarding the story, it's pretty formulaic as most sports themed movies are, so the value is in the messaging mentioned earlier. I didn't know going in that the picture was based on a true story, so that makes it's lessons more accessible for viewers accustomed to feel good sports films that have no connection to reality. Just like the earlier movie ""Hoosiers"", this one places value on relationships, discipline, teamwork, finding the good in somebody, and ultimately, redemption. The fact that the Richmond Oilers missed out on a Cinderella, story book ending shouldn't diminish it's impact as a valuable life lesson for those in unfortunate circumstances. The team may have lost that final championship game, but they emerged winners in life.",Coach Carter
3,jboothmillard,Coach Carter,5,4 June 2009,"Based on a true story, I knew the theme and leading actor, so that was enough to get me interested, from director Thomas Carter (Save the Last Dance). Set in 1999, this is the story of Ken Carter (Samuel L. Jackson), a sporting goods store owner who accepts the job of basketball coach at his old high school in Richmond, California, where he was a champion athlete. He is not only brought in to teach his male students basketball, but to help them improve their attitudes and results in school life. He is only going to let them be in ""the team"" when they have got good results for their classes, if they behave respectfully and ultimately get the attitude to win the game. Of course Carter learns they are still doing poorly in class, and while they are successful on the court, he is not afraid to stop them playing and having everyone go against him, which does happen. Eventually his students do improve academically, and they do get to play in the big game of the time, and even though they lose, their spirits are not broken, and they all went on to have worthwhile lives. Also starring Robert Ri'chard as Damien Carter, Rob Brown as Kenyon Stone, singer Ashanti as Kyra, Debbi Morgan as Tonya, Rick Gonzalez as Timo Cruz, Antwon Tanner as Worm, Nana Gbewonyo as Junior Battle, Channing Tatum as Jason Lyle, Texas Battle as Maddux and Denise Dowse as Principal Garrison. Jackson as always gives a good performance that seems the best reason to see the film, and it may have many clichés that you may see in other sports drama films, but it wouldn't hurt to try it. Worth watching!",Coach Carter

5,edwagreen,"With Coach Carter, A New Kind of Winning ****",10,13 May 2014,"Samuel L. Jackson was in top form as the new high school basketball coach who had the foresight to see beyond the arena and strive for academic achievement among his difficult group within a very difficult school.Jackson takes over the team and immediately instills discipline and a contract advocating academic attainment before basketball may be played. When the team members fail to live up to their bargain academically, Carter cancels practice and allows his winning team to begin forfeiting games.Naturally, this meets with community opposition. Loud mouth parent Octavia Spencer is wonderful here as a mother who sees only basketball as an opportunity for her son to grow.The point is driven home as the team comes around to Carter's standards.Excellent film getting away from the notion about students attaining academic scholarships in sports when they are so deficient in academic areas.",Coach Carter
6,michaelRokeefe,Coach is a cut above.,7,28 June 2005,"Realistic drama based on the true story of Coach Ken Carter(Samuel L. Jackson), a daring and inspiring coach that returns to Richmond High School in Richmond, California where he still held records from his basketball exploits. Carter accepts a little over $1,000 to work four months as basketball coach for a team of uncooperative, but heady young men. Carter has the players sign a contract to keep their grades up or be suspended from the team. When it is known that his players are not making the grade average and/or just not showing up for class; community outrage erupts when Carter benches his undefeated team and locks them out of the gym. In storybook fashion, the players left on the team bring their grades up and continue their Cinderella season to the state playoffs.Typical slam dunks, ally-oops and no-look passes. PG-13 violence, language and sexual content. COACH CARTER stands and delivers. Worth watching more than once. Cast members include: Rob Brown, Channing Tatum, Robert Ri'chard, Antwon Tanner, Rick Gonzalez and a sterling performance from singer Ashanti. Jackson should be very proud of his outstanding portrayal as the inspiring coach.",Coach Carter
7,hitchcockthelegend,"You said we're a team. One person struggles, we all struggle. One person triumphs, we all triumph.",8,30 December 2009,"Coach Carter is based on a true story, in which Richmond High School head basketball coach Ken Carter made the headlines in 1999 for locking out his undefeated team due to their poor academic results. This, at a time when the team was excelling out on the court, caused a furious reaction from the parents, the town and principals alike.You have seen one uplifting sport movie then you have seen them all it would seem. From the likes of comedy fluff such as Major League, to the more serious approach in productions like Remember the Titans et al, the formula is prescribed to leave a warming glow come the inevitable finale. What helps these types of movies succeed of course, is if the film is based around a true story, such as this one is, and more crucially, if the main actor is able to fully grab the viewers attention and hold it as formulae and ennui threaten to take control. Enter Samuel L. Jackson as Ken Carter.Jackson, the work-horse that he is, has a CV that is as up and down as an automated Big-Dipper. What isn't in question is that he is always value for money, even in garbage like The Man. Here, he elevates Coach Carter above the yarn status that it looks on the page. Ken Carter was a rich character, a man who wanted to keep his charges out of prison and the morgue. To get them to be all they can be as they move from being boys to becoming men, both on the court and in the classroom. Basketball is merely one slice of the pie, Ken Carter wants them to be fully formed young men. And Jackson plays it absolutely perfect. Blending sophisticated hard-assery with steely determination, Jackson excels and makes the overlong running time well worth sitting thru.Yes it's a bit paint by numbers, how could it not be really? But any film that has the gumption to put academia on the same playing court as hoop shooting deserves an extra plaudit. Aided by the exciting, and authentic looking on-court action {well done director Thomas Carter} Coach Carter, and especially Sammy Jackson, manages to deliver more than enough interest to make this one of the better sports movies of the last decade. 7.5/10",Coach Carter
8,dbborroughs,Above average feel good movie,7,13 February 2005,"The story of a coach who benches his team for bad grades could have been a disaster in the making. However thanks to a fine performance by Samuel Jackson this is a movie that is really alive with people and not clichéd.The coach wants his team to be more than just players. Basketball is a privilege which he feels that have to earn, by dressing right, behaving right and by getting good grades. To him basketball is more than the only thing in life. This of course causes a good many problems.This was much better than I expected and I made it all the way through it although walking in I thought I might walk out. Its gripped me more than many recent films which is saying a good deal. If I had a complaint is that it is just a bit long, but thats a minor complaint.See this movie.",Coach Carter
9,zardoz-13,"""Coach Carter"" makes the grade!!!",8,2 February 2005,"Every conscientious high school educator ought to watch the new hoops movie ""Coach Carter,"" an inspirational but formulaic, true-life sports saga about a messianic basketball coach that recycles elements from the 1987 Gene Hackman netter ""Hoosiers"" and the 1989 Morgan Freeman classic ""Lean On Me."" Not only does Samuel L. Jackson deliver a powerful performance, but also Coach Ken Carter's real-life exploits provide him with his most charismatic role since the 1995 Bruce Willis police thriller ""Die Hard With a Vengeance."" Moreover, Jackson doesn't have to shoot, stab, or slay anybody to hold our attention. Okay, he roughs up a haughty high school student, but Jackson's suit & tie clad character restraints his temper. After all, he serves as their role model, rather like Denzel Washington in ""Remember the Titans."" The biggest difference between ""Coach Carter"" and the aforementioned films is Carter demands that his team sign a contract that pledges them to maintain a 2.3 grade point average. When our hero discovers that several players are flunking out, Carter padlocks the gym and forfeits the next game, even though he has transformed the Oilers into an undefeated Cinderella phenomenon. Suddenly, stunned parents and teachers who've grown accustomed to their team winning contend that Carter is unreasonably depriving their students of a golden opportunity obtain scholarships from scouts to attend nearby colleges.""Coach Carter"" preaches its loud, obvious but admirable message without short-changing the audience when it comes time to entertain them. The disciplinary scenes where Carter whips his students into shape recall the 1967 Lee Marvin World War II blockbuster ""The Dirty Dozen."" Interestingly, too, another message emerges from this fast-paced, often exciting, but flawed feel-good saga. Even more controversial than Carter's decision to bench the team is a young female character's (the big-screen debut of singer Ashanti) decision to terminate her pregnancy when her boyfriend, Kenyon (Rob Brown of ""Finding Forrester""), and she both realize they cannot raise a family and attend college at the same time. Incredibly, the academic excellence message overshadows the abortion subplot. Sometimes, what people pay attention to reveals as much about themselves as an audience than the movie itself. Moreover, critics have either overlooked or bypassed this incendiary issue. Nobody gets really upset with the abortion subplot. Instead, the parents, teachers, and administrators howl about Carter's audacious scheme to bench the team until they can hike their Q.P.A. to a level acceptable for acceptance at a junior college.Biographies like ""Coach Carter"" tend to degenerate into saintly hero-worship, because--unless the person is dead--the studio doesn't want to worry about a lawsuit for character assassination. Despite this ever-present fear, director Thomas Carter, who helmed ""Save The Last Dance For Me,"" wrings convincing performances out of a largely unknown cast. There's chemistry between Jackson and his twentysomething co-stars, and the Mark (""The Perfect Score) Schwahn and John (""Varsity Blues"") Gatins screenplay provides us with many suspenseful moments off court as well as on the court. Sure, the subplots surrounding the team building scenes are riddled with clichés, but the persuasive performances give you a reason to overlook these staples.""Coach Carter"" is pretty straightforward and takes places over a span of four months back in 1998. The action occurs at Richmond High School in California where the basketball team-the Oilers-compiled a losing record of 4 wins and 22 losses. In frustration, the coach convinces Carter to take on the coaching job without pay. As it turns out, Carter attended Richmond as a teen and set All-American basketball records that nobody has topped. At first, the students balk at the rigid conditions that he sets down for them to follow if they want to play. Not only must they wear suits and ties to school, but also they must sit on the front row of their classes. One arrogant student, Timo Cruz (Rick Gonzales of ""Biker Boyz"") storms out in a rage. Later, after he sees Carter work his magic and convert the team into contenders, he begs his way back into the fold. Purists will argue that the film presents all the usual stereotypes of inner-city, at-risk minority youths. Essentially, this is an accurate way of looking at ""Coach Carter."" Samuel L. Jackson dominates the film with his bossy character, and the movie sizzles when he appears on screen. Meanwhile, all the subplots except the abortion date back 1970's blaxploitation thrillers.The worst thing about ""Coach Carter"" is director Thomas Carter's (no relation to the protagonist) strategy to downplay academics. Understandably, the visual dynamics of taking tests and attaining high grades present few photogenic possibilities compared with adrenalin-laced action on the basketball court. Indeed, Carter stages the on-court action with skill, and you get caught up in the team's determination to win against long odds, especially in the final championship showdown. Aside from its commendable message, ""Coach Carter"" succeeds where other recent sports dramas, like the lackluster ""Friday Night Lights,"" flounder. Samuel L. Jackson's memorable performance, the white-knuckled tension during the basketball games, and a sturdy supporting cast overcoming their stereotypical roles helps ""Coach Carter"" make the grade.",Coach Carter
10,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,You get into it,7,11 November 2012,"Ken Carter(Jackson, applying his voice to delivering more motivational, inspirational speeches than you'd think they could fit into one movie... even at an excessive 127 minute running time not counting credits; at least it does tend to keep to a good pace) talks with his wife about the position as coach(and how inconvenient it is for him), and even without him saying, she knows he'll take it - I guess there's some positives to marrying The Seer. He asks the students to sign an academic contract with him, and promises if they maintain a certain average, he'll take them to victory in the State championship. Sprinkle your stock conflicts, clichés and subplots(a few of which seem to only be there because it actually happened... points for accuracy, sure, however, you need to properly set up and resolve them as well, that, or cut them, call poetic license if you must) of sports flicks(and as someone who isn't actually a fan of them, let me say that I enjoyed this, without it being redefining or fresh), sanitize it to After School Special levels(well, what do you expect from MTV?) and you have this predictable mix. Dialog is very Hollywood, and gets exposition-happy a little too often. The vernacular and characterizations are somewhere between what's realistic and what the most whitebread adults on Earth think African-American and Latino teenagers behave and talk like. And this is very big on discipline, no problem that it can't solve... an attitude that one should at least keep in check. On the plus side, this does have plenty of exciting basketball action, and they usually really are shooting when we see them do so, it doesn't cut to cover for them. This is well-cast and the acting is at times as impressive as the material allows. There is a lot of moderate language(as much as they could do on a PG-13) and brief bloody violence in this. The DVD comes with the two well-done featurettes Coach Carter: The man behind the movie(20 minutes long, with interviews with many of the real people), the 11 and a half minute Fast break at Richmond High(about the actors training), 12 minute of decent deleted scenes and the 4 and a half minute music video ""Hope"". I recommend this to any fan of the sub-genre. 7/10",Coach Carter
11,view_and_review,Terrific,9,9 March 2021,"I have a few reasons for loving this movie:1. It's a sports movie and there's hardly a sports movie that I don't like.2. It's a true story which makes it doubly good.3. It's based in Richmond which is close to where I grew up.""Coach Carter"" was a different kind of sports movie. Sure, it involved a worst-to-first element and a hard nosed coach ala ""Remember the Titans"" and ""Miracle,"" but it was monumentally different in that Coach Ken Carter (played by Samuel L. Jackson) wasn't all about basketball. He was willing to halt basketball altogether if that's what it took for his players to focus on school and pick up their grades.What makes this movie, and Coach Carter's move, so compelling is that he had a winning basketball team. When Carter took over the Richmond High School hoops team they had just come off of a 4-22 season. That's atrocious by any estimation. Coach Carter promised to make them winners if they followed his plan, but before any of that, every player would have to sign a contract. The main precepts of the contract were that they'd be on time for practice, maintain a 2.3 GPA, sit at the front of their classes, and wear a tie on game day. These are not unreasonable demands, but you'd have thought he asked for them to give blood the way some of the players reacted.Those that signed the contract and adhered to Carter's rules were allowed to play. What was the result? They were winners. They became very good. In fact, they were undefeated until Coach Carter received some progress reports and saw failing grades. It was then that he cancelled practices and games due to the players' failure to meet the terms of the contracts they signed. It was a ballsy move, but it truly illustrated how serious Carter was about these kids' education.How many of us have the strength and fortitude to do the same? How many of us would bar our winning team from playing because they were failing? It's easy to lockout a losing team, but then that wouldn't be a story anyway--but locking out an undefeated team?!?! That's what men of principle do.As a production and as a story I loved this movie, although I think Ashanti was seriously miscast. Someone forgot to inform her that she was playing someone from Richmond, California not Brooklyn, New York. As a California native it drove me crazy every time she spoke, like ""You are not in New York!""I had to get that off of my chest.In spite of Ashanti, ""Coach Carter"" was a terrific movie.",Coach Carter
12,disdressed12,the movie is inspirational without being preachy and Samuel L.Jackson puts on an acting clinic,7,3 August 2007,"there are many 'based on true events,underdog stories' made into movies.but this one is different.yes,it is inspirational,but it isn't preachy and schmaltzy like so many have been.maybe the studios are finally seeing the light.after all,this is the second recent movie of the genre(that i have seen) to get it right,the other being ""Glory Road"".as for ""Coach Carter"",it's a pretty subdued affair.it focuses on a High School basketball coach(Samuel.L.Jackson)who has a vision for the students at his school.not only will they become winners on the basketball court,but they will also be inners off.this means as human beings,they will lose he loser,mediocrity mentality which has been ingrained intro them,by the school system and even their parents.of course,he meets fierce opposition.does he succeed in this vision?well,lets just say things don't go quite the way you might expect them to.this movie is very character and story driven,so don't expect a lot of action.there aren't that many basketball sequences.much of the movie takes place off the court.but the movie works for 3 reasons.first,its ability to tell an inspirational story without bringing out the sledgehammer.second,the the supporting performances are all credible.but more important is the masterful acting of Samuel L.Jackson.the man is simply mesmerizing.you believe every second of his performance.the man has great screen presence and charisma and the emotion he conveys is real.the movie is long,but it's all about getting there,not being there,and the journey is worth it,in my opinion.",Coach Carter
13,sddavis63,My Favourite Samuel L. Jackson Movie,7,6 July 2017,"I'm not saying that this is the best film Samuel L. Jackson ever made, or that it's his finest performance. He's been a busy actor with a huge body of work, after all. But I will say that ""Coach Carter"" is probably my favourite Samuel L. Jackson movie. And his performance as Coach Ken Carter is very good, and the overall story is quite inspiring. It's a hopeful movie to watch; one that promises that things and people can turn around, and that those who could be expected to fall by the wayside can rise to the top - not just in basketball (which is the setting of this movie) but also in life. As Carter, Jackson is playing the coach of the Richmond High School basketball team. It's an inner city school that graduates only 50% of its students, few of whom actually go on to college. The basketball team is made up of a bunch of boys who couldn't care less about school, who get into trouble outside school and who lose over and over on the court. Carter comes in and lays down the law, expecting student athletes to be students first and athletes second - trying to teach them how to be winners, not only on the court but off. Along the way he faces opposition from the players themselves, their parents, their teachers, the principal and the school board - but he stands up straight, stares his detractors down and shuts down the basketball program (after having led the team to 16 straight wins) because not enough of the players are keeping up their academic end of the bargain. Ultimately he takes this group of boys - who could have just been written off as losers - to the state championship tournament, and sees many of them go to college and progress into successful lives.That's the story. It's inspiring. It's also (to be honest) entirely formulaic. It's a formula that works - which is why it's been used repeatedly for decades - but it's still a formula: Principal/Teacher/Coach takes over troubled School/Classroom/Team, gets tough and turns everything around. Usually (as here) the story is based on true events - making it even more inspiring. But it is still a formula - there's a predictability to this. You've seen it before, even if you haven't seen the movie before. But the performances from Jackson and the young actors who played the members of the team (and from Ashanti, who played Kyra, the girlfriend of one of the players) does manage to keep it seeming fresh and alive at the same time.Sure you can quibble about the timeline being off (for example, Carter took over the team in 1997 and the year of the lockout was 1999, not just a few weeks after he became coach) but chalk those things up to dramatic license. The basics are accurate enough, and the movie's an inspiring, feel-good story about a man who made a difference in a lot of young lives. Who can really argue with that? (7/10)",Coach Carter
14,wellthatswhatithinkanyway,Unoriginal but serviceable and fairly uplifting sports drama,7,7 November 2005,"STAR RATING: ***** The Works **** Just Misses the Mark *** That Little Bit In Between ** Lagging Behind * The Pits Ex military man Ken Carter (Samuel L Jackson) now owns a sports store but wants to dedicate his spare time to doing something else- being coach to the basketball team of Richmond High School, whose poor discipline and lack of direction has seen them lose nearly every game in the season. The tough-little-gangsta wannabe boys initially show their usual disrespect and un-cooperativeness to the coach, but they soon learn he will not take the cr*p they're used to giving other coaches before him and step into line a little. Despite their initial dislike, Carter comes to do something no other teacher in the system has done before him- respect the boys and actually push them to achieve in a system that ""is designed for them to fail"", but also to show them that that respect has to be earned and that if they abuse it, they will suffer. So when their academic performance fails to improve, he cancels the basketball games for a while. This incurs the wrath of the boys, their parents, other teachers and the community as a whole, but in time, Carter's decision will come to reward the boys and change their lives in ways they never imagined.Coach Carter can hardly be described as original- the story has been done quite a few times before (Dangerous Minds, Mr Holland's Opus- right down to the true story part.) But this doesn't stop it from being any less effective as a film for what it is. It succeeds in being engaging, inspirational and uplifting. Perhaps not the greatest film of it's kind ever, but a pleasing effort certainly.As Carter, the heavily working Jackson assumes a natural command and presence. He is pretty much the driving force of the film, but he couldn't have done it without a solid supporting cast, providing some emotive sub-plots and great depth to the story.It's certainly been produced by MTV alright, as the soundtrack boasts a heap of current popular tracks that anyone over here familiar with the top 40 tracks will know. And it's a great vehicle to appeal to hip younger cinema-goers. ***",Coach Carter
15,g-bodyl,Rises Above the Clichés!,9,13 August 2013,"Coach Carter is a very formulaic sports film that follows every rule in the rulebook for sports film. However, thanks to a very centralized, high-powered performance by Samuel L. Jackson, this film is able to stand on its own two feet. There are some emotional moments when you are rooting for the underdog, in this case the Richmond Oilers, to win it all. This film also showcases the tough time people have growing up in poor areas and the broken-down American education system.Thomas Carter's film is about a legendary basketball player named Ken Carter who goes back to his old high school to coach a number of violent, uneducated people the true game of basketball and how the game will change their attitudes, and more importantly their lives.Samuel L. Jackson does one heck of a job in his role. Thanks to his inspiring performance, this movie is worth watching. He is passionate about this role and despite acting as a bully to his players, you feel for him since you know that he cares for his players and will do anything to give them a better life and go to college.Overall, this is an above-average sports film thanks to Jackson. Even without him, this film would have been good despite having almost every cliché in the book. But hey, this is quality filmmaking. I was able to enjoy the drama and all the games. I liked how they went from the bad news bears of basketball to playing like champions. I rate this film 9/10.",Coach Carter

Jacksons title character Coach Ken Carter is terrific and I have seen many films with him in it,because he is in so much,but none with him as into the character as he is in this,he was in character from start to finish.Coach Carter will inspire students struggling in school with some amazing speeches and characters that improve on there subjects and other things outside of school along the way.A new coach trains a high school basketball team,he is very strict but just wants them to do well,he stops letting them play until they improve on there subjects and prove they are worthy.",Coach Carter
17,Floated2,Underrated true story based sports drama,7,16 February 2017,"Coach Carter (2005) appears to be one of Samuel L. Jackson's more overlooked leading roles. This is a film with a firm message which is to take responsibility for yourself and your actions. It's a good message and it's delivered by a solid cast. The main subject is about basketball, but at a run time of over 2 hours, this film dwells into deeper subjects regarding the students of the team.Here we see Sam Jackson star in the titular role as a sporting goods store owner who accepts a job as high school basketball coach at the school where he still holds several basketball records. This film is based on a true story where we are understood that Jackson is portraying a real life figure. The team at the school is filled with raw talent, but no discipline. Carter begins his reign as coach by requiring all of the boys on the team to sign a contract stating that they will maintain a 2.3 GPA, that they will sit in the front row of every class, and that they must wear a coat and tie to school on game days. In return, he promises to guide them to a winning season. After much grumbling, the boys fall in line and begin to accept the Coach, especially after his training methods soon put them on an undefeated winning streak.One thing which is quite hard to grasp at is how quickly Coach Carter was able to turn the team around. It is mentioned early in the film that they were a terrible team the previous year (winning 4 games, with 22 losses), and once Carter comes along, he is instantly able to turn them into a great team (mentioned as winning 16 straight at one point in the film). The challenge seemed quite easier than it should have, where we did not see much struggle. Though in the end, is where the film takes a turn and since it is based on a true story, not everything is a happy ending. The team unfortunately lose their championship game by a very close game. Had this been a fiction film, that most likely would not have happened. Overall, this film is quite interesting though outdated with many of the references and the overall outlook of the film. A great entertaining watch for fans of sports dramas. As a rewatch 12/17/20' Coach Carter remains a solid sports drama film.",Coach Carter

19,mattkratz,remarkable,9,16 December 2005,"This was one of the most remarkable biopics I have seen in recent years. Samuel L. Jackson gives a marvelous performance as Richmond (CA) basketball coach Ken Carter, who has just been hired for the job. He makes it clear to his players that he means serious business. He makes them sign a contract requiring them to maintain a 2.3 GPA, show up for all their classes, and wear a coat and tie on game days, among other things. He wants them to earn the title ""student athletes,"" with student coming first. When they break the terms of the contract, he locks them out of practice and games until they get their priorities straight, which I thought was the right thing to do. This was one of Jackson's best roles and performances. I think the movie was very well done and made me think about my priorities as well. A winner.*** out of ****",Coach Carter

21,eric262003,One That Has A Light Message Of Hope,8,19 August 2013,"""Coach Carter"" is a heart-warming story that is based on actual events, but what stands out from the other true story movies is that it refrains itself from any kind of ""artistic licencing"" from being a Hollywood movie. And that is simply because it really doesn't need to. The inspirational story of Coach Ken Carter and the Richmond Oilers is molded as an uplifting to one's spirits and it tells us that there really is a ray of hope and that we can achievement if we all believe in ourselves.Sure it sounds lame and preachy, but the movie is constantly fixated on telling us that academics must come before athletics. The main focus is centred around Coach Carter and the gripping sports scenes is enough to satisfy any sports fan especially those who love basketball.Samuel L. Jackson is flawless as the no-nonsense Coach Carter and he does without putting much effort into the role but the dedication to his coaching and his encouragement towards his team is just the natural way to prove how developed this character really is. The performance and the accuracy is so impressive you wouldn't think it was Samuel L. Jackson performing, but the real Coach Carter himself. But he's not the only thespian who melted our heart, but the performers who played the students; in fact they are the heart and soul to the movie as they keep this movie as real and effective as possible. Even singer Ashanti shows her acting chops are quite effective and not flashy at all.Unlike most movies who cowardly take the easy way out by just rushing through the ending and going for the formulaic happy ending, ""Coach Carter"" ends the movie with a real ending where these athletes are not destined to just winning the school's championship but where their academic achievements became a top priority to them. I wish that Hollywood would have more stories on values like these than the garbage we've been fed to over the years.The extras on the DVD are quite special as we are introduced to the real Ken Carter who seems to come across as being more but amusingly laid back and less intense than Jackson's portrayal. But i'm sure the real Ken Carter must have left a lasting impact toward the students and the kids as Richmond High. I just wish the documentary on Ken Carter was more in depth a much more longer and I wished we can get more insight on the students and compare the similarities between the actual students and the characters that were portrayed in the movie.The second feature looks into the making behind the movie itself as we observe just how the choreographing and the skill the characters had to go through to make and maintain the realism of the movie. The actual sports scenes are such a joy to watch it sends shivers down my spine. It might be mundane in some people because not everyone has knowledge in all the technical terms that's in basketball so if you're watching the movie for the drama and inspiration, please bring along a manual called ""Basketball for Dummies"". One of the weaknesses the movie has is that in the extras we don't get the opportunity focus on the mastermind behind the movie, director Thomas Carter. I don't know if he's just a humble individual or if he played a dominating role in the production, but he's never mentioned or talked about in the extras. I also wonder if the director is related to the titular character of the movie.To summarize this movie is quite pleasing and very optimistic in it message. It was a very entertaining and never falls prey to continuously preach that academics is equally important if not better than athletics. I think those who come from working-class environments to get a better view to show that there is always a sign of hope. The statistics that Ken Carter reveals to his students that young African American men are more than likely will end up in jail than advanced education is quite staggering. And this should open the eyes to not just black Americans but to everyone that prison life is not the life you want to live in. It's also important that just because you are playing basketball in school, doesn't mean it's a one-way ticket to the NBA. But a good education is the key to life and after watching this movie, I'm sure it will open eyes to everyone who really cares about their education.",Coach Carter

There was a lot in this movie other than just basketball. This movie had some guns and stuff that shot bullets. I mean, I am sitting here right now and some guy just got shot!!!!

23,gregsrants,"Parts Hoosiers, Dead Poets Society and Lean on Me",6,25 January 2005,"Parts Hoosiers, part Dead Poet's Society and part Lean on Me, Samuel L. Jackson stars as high school basketball coach Ken Carter in the new MTV/Paramount release, Coach Carter.Inspired by a true story, Ken Carter was responsible for turning around the basketball athletic program at Richmond High School by less than conventional methods. Carters' philosophy was that education was far more important than any athletic achievement and he had each of the team members sign a contract that agrees to some significant terms. Included in the personal agreements were to maintain a 2.3 grade point average, to attend every class and sit in the front row and to wear a jacket and tie on game days. In return, the players get the benefit of his coaching tutelage and the use of a gym facility for their training regiment.Getting the lowly Richmond team to work as a team would be a tougher job than expected. With a 4-20 something record the year previous, there was much room for improvement and the teenage kids were acting like, well, teenagers when given their first dose of authority. But things do get off to a rousing start until coach gets their progress reports from the teaching faculty and shuts down the gym forfeiting two matches 16 games into the successful season.This caused quite an uproar in the community and gave Carter some media attention back in 1999. Perceived as taking away the highlight of an adolescent's school memory while striking a blow to an incredible turnaround in achievement, parents convened in a town-hall type meeting to vote on the future of the imposed lockout and ultimately the future of coach Carter. The result can all be determined if you have seen any of the three movies I listed in the opening paragraph, and the team does get to play at least one more memorable game towards their legacy.Coach Carter comes from a very short line of good basketball films. In fact, this side of professional hockey, there is not much other than 1986's Hoosiers and Spike Lee's He Got Game there is not much to cheer about (sorry Blue Chips). However, Coach Carter does prove to be inspirational and the basketball game footage and camera angles are maybe the best ever filmed to represent the fast paced sport.Samuel L. Jackson does his best Samuel L. Jackson impression and is believable as a coach that would put in the time and energy into a thankless ($1,500/year thankless) coaching position. The kids too also pull off just enough to make the strong glide down court without feeling as if we are traveling towards an expected conclusion.There were some liberties taken that are truly evident. The fact that two high school teams can score 14 points between them with less than two minutes left in the game yet only get 70-odds for the entire contest was a bit hard to believe (but not impossible so I am told).But the major problem with Coach Carter was the running time. Clocking in at an unnecessary 136 minutes, there are far too many musical montages of Carter thinking alone in the gym or the team walking through the school halls. It was as if MTV films was trying to squeeze a double disc CD complication out of the experience, and I quite frankly could have cared less for these non-story moving moments.So too could the team members quitting the team ended up on the cutting room floor. They walk away only to come back only to walk away again. Surely, some amalgamation of the events could have been conjured to keep things on a forwards progress.But these are small nitpicks for what is overall a very enjoyable and moving experience. Coach Carter does deliver the goods and even though your bum might take time to forgive you for shuffling in your seat for two plus hours, at least the final result is a film that kids and parents alike can enjoy and hopefully draw inspiration from. And that my friends is a slam dunk.www.gregsrants.com",Coach Carter

25,spookyrat1,Rims Out!,6,21 November 2018,"It's a sports movie that presses all the normal sports movie buttons, right through to the emotive climax. Down and out underperforming school basketball team from a poor socio-economic area, is led to salvation (in more ways than one) through the concerted efforts of a charismatic coach, who once attended the same school.Oddly what we don't get in a two and a quarter hour ""biographical"" movie called Coach Carter, is to learn much about the man himself ... Ken Carter. We find out he is a passionate advocate for educational achievement and the chances and choices it can offer those with a will to succeed. We discover a few of the strategies he uses to develop the Richmond Oilers from a position as a lowly rung team to one that can challenge for a schools state championship. In achieving his own goals, unsurprisingly we uncover the fact that he doesn't mind treading on administrative, player and parental toes to attain his ambitions.But that's about it. Yes he has a son called Damien who was also a very skilful player and played for the Oilers. He has some sort of retail business in Richmond and he has a loving wife whose name I'm not sure we even learn by the end of the film, she gets such little screen time. He is wonderfully played by the always distinguished Samuel L Jackson, but we find out little of his background, what makes him tick and why he seemingly, so suddenly wants to make a difference with the team and the team's school. His story is sketched so lightly that he just appears to come from nowhere.Instead much of the running time of this long film explores the lives of some of the team's players and (ironically enough) their families. Apparently (based on the end credits) most are real people, but their stories are similar to what we've seen in any number of similar school/sports/urban teenage films where characters strive to overcome a variety of disadvantages and adversities.The film has solid production values and the basketball choreography is first rate. But I was personally disappointed that by film's conclusion, the title character standing on the sidelines, calling all the shots and making all the big moves, was himself not fleshed out much past the cipher stage.",Coach Carter
26,jpschapira,"Great men, the Carters...",8,15 December 2005,"There's a lot to say about ""Coach Carter"" leaving aside the simple fact that it is a very good film. Its director, Thomas Carter, is surely a very determined man and a dedicate worker. His camera moves like it knows the territory by heart; it moves with a lot of freedom and confidence. Sometimes, it seems to be in someone's hand, because it moves a lot; because there's a lot to see in this movie.The same happened in ""Save the last dance"" a very well crafted piece directed by Carter, that dealt, among other things, with racial problems, as does ""Coach Carter"" in some ways. But Carter is no writer, he's a director that could seem like a writer because he really wants to direct. Anyway, here the writers are a mix of experts about what the movie needed to deal with.Mark Schawn created ""One Tree Hill"", a TV show where the main characters play basketball, as the characters of this film do. He also wrote ""The Perfect Score"", a picture I haven't seen but I imagine covers a lot of young students personal issues, as ""Coach Carter"". The other writer was responsible for two sports movies; one about love (""Summer Catch"") and another one about dreams and inspiration (""Hardball""). It is a perfect team.And a perfect result, too; because their screenplay is flawless, at least in the issues it presents. ""We're going to treat ourselves with respect"", Ken Carter (Samuel L. Jackson) says during his first training at Richmond School. He must be a good coach, because his son (solid Robert Ri'chard) moved from an esteemed high school, to one that graduates the 50% of its students just to train with his dad.Ken Carter is a good coach, but in his own ways. The year before he arrived, the school's team the Oilers won only four games; now they're undefeated. The man is accomplishing his job, but not the totality of it. The other part relies in a contract every student signed before being in the team. It includes attending all of the classes in front row, maintaining a 2.3 average and wearing tie on the game's day. Technically, by not following the rules, the students are failing.But for Coach Carter they are all failing, because they are team, and this among other things is what he intends to teach them, indirectly. ""What is your deepest fear?"", he asks Timo Cruz (impressive Rick Gonzalez), when he has to complete an impossible task to be back on the teamWhat does that mean? ""What does your father do?"", he asks Jason Lyle (debutant Channing Tatum). ""My father's in prison"", the boy answers. ""Ask yourself if you wanna end like him"", Carter finishes.His methods will generate controversy, he will be questioned by everyone, but what really matters isn't what the parents think, or what the school principals think; what really matters is what the kids think is best for them, and what they want for their future.The whole young cast is adequate. Nana Gbewonyo, Antwon Tanner. They're all talented, especially Rob Brown (that boy from Finding Forrester) as Kenyon Stone, an intelligent young man with a pregnant girlfriend (young pregnancy is dealt with, as in the director's previous film) played naturally by Ashanti. I would like to see a lot more of Brown, because he's got a lot to give.However, the generator of the environment and the head of the project is Mister Samuel L. Jackson, with a bald head and an ambiguous look. Used to play ""the man"" (ironically that's the name of his last film), as he did in ""S.W.A.T"", ""Shaft"" or going back in ""One Eight Seven"", puts the soberness away and creates a humanly defined character, in what's his best performance in three years; since his dedicate father in ""Changing Lanes"".I will make no commentaries about the cheesy music I despise so much and forgot to mention in ""The Longest Yard""; but I'll say it works, no matter how hard we try to reject itFinally, the fact that ""Coach Carter"" is based on a true story, leaves me even more amazed than how I already am of this film-making achievement.",Coach Carter
27,Isaac5855,A Sports Movie that is both Inspirational and Unpredictable...,8,12 January 2007,"COACH CARTER is an inspiring and richly entertaining film, based on a true story. This is the story of Ken Carter, a man who returns to his high school alma mater to become the new basketball coach. Carter creates priorities for the guys on the team by presenting them with a contract that they must sign and honor if they are to play on the team. The contract states that they are to maintain a 2.3 GPA, go to their classes every day, sit in the front row of their classes,and wear a tie on game day. As much as Carter loves the game of basketball, he still feels their education should be the guys' number one priority. The team, which had a 4-22 record the preceding season, racks up 15 victories in a row until Carter learns that a couple of the team members are not keeping up their GPA. He then puts a lock on the gym door and cancels all games until the guys get their grades up. The furor this causes in the small town is understandable, since basketball scholarships are probably the only way these inner city kids are going to be able to go to college, but Carter is determined to send the message that there is life after basketball. Samuel L. Jackson turns in a commanding performance, as always, in the title role, as the man who cares what happens to the guys after they hang up their sneakers. Jackson's performance and a screenplay that's a bit preachy but does offer surprises make this film more than worth your time.",Coach Carter

29,movieguy1021,Coach Carter: 8/10,8,9 February 2005,"Samuel L. Jackson can do no wrong (unless it involves a movie with the number 51 in it). Whether it's Pulp Fiction, Jackie Brown, or even XXX, Jackson always gives off an aura of ""cool""-anyone would want to know him or be him in any of those characters, no matter how wrong the character was. The same holds true for his titular role in Coach Carter. Although it's not one of his ""bad-ass"" roles, he comes off as a cool person with a moral core. Ken Carter is the only character audiences can identify with, and therefore we go along with his actions, and understand his motives. Not only that, but it's a refreshing break from these Disney-produced ""These people can do it, so so can you!"" sports movies. Instead, it's a hard-hitting, tiring adventure through the true story (what else) of a Northern California town and their trials and tribulations.Ken Carter (Jackson) is hired as the coach of an inner-city basketball team. They're a great team, but lack discipline and academic skills. Carter instigates a vigorous lateness policy (thousands upon thousands of warm-up exercises), and then locks down the gym when the team fails to maintain a 2.3 GPA. Carter handles all controversy handed to him in the typical Samuel L. Jackson manner.Although unfairly compared to Remember the Titans, the two movies couldn't be any more different. Titans had Denzel Washington (who's nowhere near as cool as Jackson) in a sugar-coated movie about racism. Coach Carter IS racist (about a dozen or so n-words...where's Spike Lee on this one?), and there's no real message, except that knowledge is power (somewhat). Being that Carter's PG-13, unlike Titans's PG, it can get away with much more, with a more developed story. There's a lot of subplots, including drug deals and teen pregnancy. It's great to see such adult topics dealt with in a teen movie (well, it's somewhat like a teen movie). And it's not slammed down our throats, either. It's presented, and we take what we want out of it.Not only that, but we're able to identify with Carter and his actions. Although they seem (and are) extreme, we can understand where he's coming from. It's like Kurt Russell's insistence in that one (the only good) scene of Miracle. Plus, there's Samuel L. Jackson, who can make everything except Formula 51 a gem. Plus, there's the fact that I saw the movie over a month ago, and don't really remember much from it. But it's surprisingly great for a January release, and one you should at least pick up on DVD.My rating: 8/10Rated PG-13 for violence, sexual content, language, teen partying and some drug material.",Coach Carter

All the team players signed his contract to do just that. The team was undefeated and on it's way to the 1999 State Championship, when Coach Carter received the low grades of his players. Coach Carter received national attention when he locked the gym and benched the whole team for poor grades. Coach Carter received some praise and much more criticism for his decision. This is a good inspirational movie of what one must do to excel in sports and in life. Coach Carter taught his players that they must be committed and work hard to excel.

34,ethanbresnett,A testament to the power of sport,8,18 June 2020,"There were lots of striking similarities between Coach Carter and Remember the Titans which I also watched recently. Both based on real events, they tell the story of a sports team who are anything but a team, too used to losing and with no hope of redemption. Enter the stern coach who shakes things up, gets them winning, teaching them respect and discipline along the way.I must say I love these types of stories. Sports movies can often be overlooked as a genre, but there is so much heart, passion, emotion and character in the majority that I have seen. Despite the subject matter, don't think that this film is purely for basketball fans. I've never watched a second of basketball in my life but was engrossed nonetheless in the trials and tribulations of the players and the team. This is a human story as much as it is a sports one, with an emphasis off the court for lots of the film.The biggest triumph of this film for me is Samuel L. Jackson's performance. The character of Ken Carter was a deeply interesting one, but interesting because of his simplicity. He was a man with a firm set of principles from which he never wavered, making him a central and unmovable force in the movie. The rest of the cast were equally great, particularly Rick Gonzalez as Timo Cruz, one of the more volatile members of the team.I also thought that the script was very solid. There's nothing I love more than a good motivational sports related speech, which Coach Carter has aplenty, all excellently delivered by Sam Jackson.For any sports film you want the actual sports element to be realistic. As mentioned I've never watched basketball, but it seemed pretty real to me. Good camera work during the games, nice flowing montages, creation of suspense. Not much more I could ask for from the basketball action.Last but not least the soundtrack for Coach Carter was spot on, matching the tone and vibe of the film exactly.Coach Carter, much like Remember the Titans, is a testament to the power of sports, expertly demonstrating that its not just a game. Sport is so much more and informs and develops every facet of an individuals life, which Coach Carter displays in bucket loads. A great film which will lift you up and provide 2 hours of solid entertainment.",Coach Carter
35,christian123,The Only Highlight Here Is Samuel L. Jackson,4,15 July 2005,"Based on a real life story that made national news in 1999, Samuel Jackson plays Coach Ken Carter, the controversial high school basketball coach who benched his entire undefeated team due to their poor performance in their classes.I admire the message from Coach Carter but I did not actually like the movie. The story is your typical sports movie with all the clichés. The film is also based on a true story though I wonder how much of that truth was put into the movie. The film was very unrealistic at times and this brought down the quality. For example, the number of push-ups and suicides he makes them do every day is flat out ridiculous. There were a few other annoying parts but they didn't bring down the film too much. I also didn't like the way this movie handled abortion. Kyra (Ashanti) is pregnant and she is really excited about having the baby. Until, she breaks up with her boyfriend and she gets an abortion. She tells him this and all he says is, ""aw man you should have told me, so I could have been there with you"". This response was really stupid as was the whole subplot. This whole thing felt like MTV's approach to the problem, like it doesn't really matter.The acting is quite strong and it is the only thing Coach Carter has going for it. Samuel L Jackson was great as Coach Carter and he made the film. If it wasn't for his presence, than the film would have been worse. Everyone on the basketball team also gave good performances though no one really stands out. Also, none of the characters were very interesting. Ashanti proves she can act with a decent performance here. However, she doesn't get a lot of screen time.Sport clichés are pretty much unavoidable. It doesn't mean that the film is bad, it just means that there really isn't anything new. Miracle and Friday Night Lights were both clichéd yet both were good films. I can't really say the same for Coach Carter though. The film was just too long for a predictable story and it also lacked compelling characters. Miracle was also 134 minutes long yet it had interesting characters and it wasn't as dull. Even the basketball games in Coach Carter weren't very interesting and this hurt the film for me.The movie also pounds it's message into the viewer's head without really giving a good argument. Yes, school should come first but it would be different in this case because most of the players only have basketball to rely on. They come from a poor neighborhood and even if they do get their grades up, most will still not go to college. The end of the film kind of proved that as only six of the players actually went to college. Even if they didn't go to college, the fact that they still tried to make something of themselves is still a nice message. Though I think the players should have focused more on basketball if that was their stronger point. In the end, I would still recommend Coach Carter but it really didn't do anything for me.

After a friend asks him to coach, Ken accepts the job.The players are rebellious, they're crude, and they're violent. Coach Carter enacts a strict regime of strenuous workouts and requirements in the class room. The players are able to warm up to him and begin to have a great season before the class room reports come in. His players are failing miserably and it leads to the ultimate decision, benching every single one of them.Carter does this in order to put the players school work first and the move is meet with hostility. Players quit and parents and fans become hostile enough to call for his removal. As the lockout continues, players begin to realize that coach is doing this for there benefit and that he still has hope for them in the poor community. Now the only questions is will the players follow along with his lockout or cry in unison for his removal?As I said earlier this is based on a true story and is told beautifully. It brings back the old sense of sports movies such as Hossiers and Remember the Titans. Samuel L. Jackson is able to bring the Coach Carter to life with a loving personality but a near-brutal view to the game. The film influenced me greatly to work harder in school and did the same for many other people I know. The film conveys a powerful message of hope and understanding. The film presents teenagers on how they actually are; not in a bad way just in the usual smart-ass way. Each actor portraying a player, especially Rick Gonzalez and Antwon Tanner, is excellent in there own way. The films plot goes over nicely and the story flows well. The basketball scenes are filmed with great care and right on in accuracy. The film was very good. Just a notch below Hoosiers but conveys the same great message.Coach Carter. Starring: Samuel L. Jackson, Rob Brown, Rick Gonzalez, Robert Ri'chard, and Antwon Tanner.4 out of 5 Stars.",Coach Carter

40,refresh_daemon,"Adequate and sufficient, it's a real film!",6,3 February 2007,"During a flight to Korea, I saw some quick ADD-like editing and knew immediately that I was in for an MTV film. And I was right. This film, apparently based on the true story of a real Coach Carter was one of the last films that I paid attention to on the flight.I've seen good sports movies and I've seen bad sports movies. One thing that I can say about sports movies is that they're very similar to melodramas, living heavily on sentiment and total utter cheesiness. Coach Carter is very much a real sports movie. Combining after-school special drama with basketball, it weaves together the story of a coach that turned his team around and their lives in the process.The problem with the film is that its portrayal of the characters is shallow. I think it's because it tries to follow too many dramatic arcs, too many characters that it tries to develop, but ultimately finds itself not developing any of the characters enough. Even though it possesses a Rocky-type ending, it still can't seem to avoid the shackle that's plagued most MTV films and after-school specials. It's too preachy. It's too sentimental. And it's too shallow.However, the acting is adequate and the directing is sufficient. Generally, the film does end up coming together as a real film. Another sports film, like many other sports films, but a watchable one nonetheless. It helped the international flight go by easier, but I don't think that I'd want to watch it again. 6/10.",Coach Carter
41,jpintar,a terrific movie,8,21 June 2005,"Coach Carter is one of the best movies of the year and one of the best movies I have seen. Samuel L. Jackson gives one of his best performances as the new head basketball coach at his high school alma mater. Carter makes his team do sprints, pass, and play as winners not just as individual players. Plus he makes the team keep at least a C+ average in school and that they attend classes. When they fail to keep that average, he cancels practices and some games until they keep their grades up. I personally like what Coach Carter teaches them. Basketball will not always be there for them. If they get an education, they can have a life after high school and even go on to college. Coach Carter makes his team winners both on and off the court. I wish there were more coaches like Coach Carter in both high school and college to prepare young people for life as adults.",Coach Carter
42,Pookyiscute,Inspirational and moving...,9,16 January 2006,"Samuael L. Jackson, once again brings a performance to the screen, like no one else could.Richmond,CA. 1999. In a mess of a city, a high school basketball team is on a continues losing streak with a poor coach. Soon, however these kids with bad attitudes, failing grades, no goals or aspirations, and no future, are turned around, by a man who believed in them more than they did themselves.I fell in love with this movie the first time I saw it and just had the pleasure of seeing it again, and cannot say enough words about how much I enjoyed the film. It was; well casted, well acted, well directed, well written and well located. It is one of the best films, based on actual events, you will ever see, and may even bring a tear to your eye, or a hope in your heart, about how wonderful life can be with just the right people or person in it. I recommend it to anyone, and although there is some crude language and sexual content, it is well overlooked, to still be the kind of film that should be played in schools.",Coach Carter
43,nicolechan916,Great story with good acting and editing.,8,12 May 2016,"The film is based on the true story of Coach Ken Carter who benched his undefeated high school basketball team in 1999, because of their poor academic standings. While the film may not be an exact replica of what took place, it definitely is an inspiring story. It is good to know that some teachers care about where their students are headed in life, and want to put them in a position where they can better succeed.The basketball action is quite exciting - especially the alley oops. The practice sessions, and teamwork are all well played out as well. There were quite a few plays that made me go 'wow, that was good'. Apparently, Channing Tatum had not played basketball before the movie, so I guess it's a good thing we don't see him with the ball much. On the other hand, the players on the court the most: Brown, Gbewonyo, Ri'chard, and Tanner are all great handlers and shooters. Jackson as the coach acts his part well. He brings the intensity and sincereness of the character across the screen. The other actors also do well at playing teenagers wanting to appear cool. However, the narrative about the more grown up character Kenyon, and his girlfriend Kyra was a nice side story. Their struggles exemplified why Coach Carter fights so hard to keep them from failing their classes.Overall, a nicely made film that was both engaging and motivating. Having said that, I'm sure some parents or teachers would have supported Carter more vocally. The film basically showed Coach Carter against the world.",Coach Carter

Although Coach Carter might be a typical MTV Hollywood teen movie , the message it sends is clear! Education is the key to freedom which gives you the edge over others , although it seems typical in places it goes along at a nice pace and you actually route and feel for the characters in this movie. There are some funny moments in this film and a few turns which make it different from other movies. Samual L Jackson as usual is in fine form for his commanding roles although I felt he did not require too much practise for this one. All members of the basket ball team done well with their performances. On the whole Coach Carter I felt is a good change for those who want to watch some solid drama .COACH CARTER - 8.1 OUT OF 10IT BEGINS ON THE STREETS..AND IT ENDS HERE ...",Coach Carter
47,alfiefamily,Good messages make it through a predictable story,6,30 July 2005,"""Coach Carter"" is much more than a movie about basketball. As a sports/basketball movie, I would say that it is as predictable as ""Hoosiers"" or ""Rocky"". But it is much more than that.It is the story of a man who felt that the kids in his program did not have to settle for the type of life that others had predicted for them. It shows that if people took the time to take time to share themselves with their community or schools, they can make a profound difference in the lives of our youth. Let them see that they have more options available to them than they might expect.Samuel L. Jackson plays Coach Carter as a hard, but fair man, who expects more from his players than they(or their community) ever expected from them. Going so far as to lock his players out of the gym, until their academic scores improve. It is a first rate, fully fleshed-out performance that never veers into cliché.Yes, there are elements of this movie that are very predictable, bordering on standard formula. But overall, the message that is sent is one that makes a tremendous impact.Other performances are very good, especially Ashanti.",Coach Carter
48,leighabc123,This Movie Doesn't Have A Typical Plot,10,15 January 2005,"Samuel L. Jackson should win an Oscar for this movie just like Jamie Foxx should win an Oscar for the movie ""Ray."" This movie starts out with the same plot that all other basketball movies have. Ghetto basketball players fighting and trying to win games. But there's a twist to this one. Coach Carter locked the gym after the players couldn't keep their grades up. If all basketball coaches behaved like this and put education first, there would be no Kobe Bryant or LeBron James. It was strange seeing Ashanti play the role of some one from the ghetto. This proves that she can act. In all other sports movies, the team that the movie is based on wins the championship. But in this movie, the Richmond Oilers LOSE the championship at the buzzer. All NBA coaches and players who have never been to college should watch this movie.",Coach Carter
49,carlos37andre,A surprisingly emotional and inspiring story!,8,30 March 2020,"I had never heard of this movie before, and I did watch it only because my sister had to watch to do an essay from school, so my expectations were somewhat low. But man, it is really good!It tells a truly emotional story, that touches on extremely sensitive issues, and the fact that it is based on a true story makes it even more powerful. Everything that surrounds the kids that lived in that neighborhood, their families, their social influences, their money problems, and so many other factors would have led to... unfortunate outcomes. And that is something even people who aren't necessarily on situations similar to the characters in the movie can learn from, and try to be more grateful for what they have, and also try to help others as much as they can.Talking about the movie itself, I found it really well written, the acting was great, and it doesn't necessarily feel almost 2 hours and 20 minutes long, which is a plus. Half way through the movie, I checked the time, and saw that we still had more than an hour to go, and... I was glad! I didn't wanna leave those characters yet, and I wanted to see them succeeding.I think tho, that after the first big win (their championship) the pace, that was going so smoothly, kind of struggled a bit, and only after a good 20, 25 minutes it started to pick up again, which is still, fine, I was invested in the characters and entertained. But it can be said as one problem.To sum up, Coach Carter is a great movie, with a touching story, that may make you re-think some important aspects of your own life. You may start think more about inequality, and privileges you didn't realized you had before, which is fine, what counts, is what you do moving forward, the way you approach life, and, if you happen to have any number of privileges, just always be grateful for it, and try to make the best of it, and luckily, in any kind of way, shape or form, you might actually do something that will give another person new opportunities, and so on. In times like this, that's something truly important to keep in mind, and think about on a day to day basis. Let's be grateful for what we have, and help others as much as we can.",Coach Carter
50,j-lacerra,To Sir With Hoosiers,4,10 March 2007,"Some reviewer here wrote that this movie was not about basketball, but about discipline, respect, etc. Well, I got news for ya, it's about basketball! Samuel L. Jackson, despite his considerable gifts, is no Sidney Poitier. Nor is he a Gene Hackman. Yet, this movie combines ""To Sir With Love"" with ""Hoosiers"" with blatant banditry. Jackson is never quite sympathetic enough, quite human enough, for the viewer to care about, and the boys on the team come off like a gang of thug wannabees.The movie seems to play fast and loose with time. Grades are brought up in, apparently, a day or so, thousands of push-ups are done in brief hours. There is a tawdry back-story about the inevitable pregnancy of a player's girlfriend, idiotic and unreasonable parents and school officials (Carter bears a lot of resemblance to Joe Clark, ""Lean On Me""). There was (for me) a lot of difficulty telling the boys apart or connecting them with their names.An irritating undercurrent in this movie is the understanding that one one either goes to college or to prison. There is apparently no room in this society for plumbers, electricians, chefs, soldiers, ... just grads and inmates.All in all, this is not a terrible movie. However, had I paid $9.00 to see it in a theater, I'd have felt robbed.",Coach Carter
51,bob-rutzel,Terrific,8,25 June 2005,"Ken Carter (Jackson) takes over a losing California high school basketball team and employs extreme measures to turn things around.Yes, we have seen this before: a hard-assed coach molds his players into the image he desires for them. Yes, Samuel L. Jackson pontificates a lot in here. But all coaches pontificate to a large degree and it is justified. And, yes, it is a little too long, but so what? The basketball scenes are truly something to behold. The acting all around is excellent. And, yes, this is a terrific movie.Okay, now for the down side. Why does Carter wait until the team is 9-0 to find out his players are not living up the contract they signed with him? The players are falling behind academically and Carter locks them out of the gym until they turn things around. But, waiting until 9-0 doesn't seem to have bothered anyone. Something doesn't seem right here, but no one has questioned this aspect. Even Carter doesn't say he should have looked harder sooner. Why not? Now, in real life Carter owned a sports store. That is probably the reason I kept seeing different uniforms for just about every different game. When some basketball game scenes opened I had to wait until Carter calls the team over to the bench to see what players were his team, and then I knew what color jerseys his team had on. Before that, the action was so fast and furious I couldn't really tell. It's not like the players' faces were widely recognizable to viewers.This is must see movie.",Coach Carter
52,jaxbubba,Take a Chance on this Flick,6,21 April 2005,"Coach Carter is a MTV feature film production. This film stars Samuel L. Jackson, and tells the true story of Coach Ken Carter from Richmond High School in inner city Los Angeles, California.Carter is a self-made man, a strict disciplinarian, and owner of his own Sporting Goods Store. As the film begins, Carter has returned to old alma mater to watch a basketball game against St. Joseph, the High School his son is attending. Prior to game, Coach Carter has already been approached by the school's current coach to take over the team.Richmond is severely thrashed, their undisciplined, their cocky, and unruly. Carter accepts the coaching position; however, it has to be on his terms. Richmond had only won 4 total games the previously year, so Coach Carter was afforded his request.Carter required all of his players to sign a contract before any of them could play ball. The contract required each player to maintain a 2.3 G.P.A., attend all scheduled classes, and to sit in the front row of all classes in which they attended. He required Progress Reports for all teachers documenting each player's academics. He also required each player to dress appropriately on Game Day, with Tie and Coat; this promoted respect in the team, and respect for oneself.Prior to the season's start, no one even knew who or where Richmond High School was, but rigorous practices, forced discipline, and strict guidance from carter turned them into winners; however, that's where the trouble started.Winning was easy, Carter had a plan; and the team executed it superbly. However, Carter wanted more for these players; he wanted hope, desire, and the ability to lift themselves above the life in which they were headed. He wanted his players to have the ability to attended college; and this could only happen if their grades were good enough.However, Richmond H.S. only graduates 33% of their seniors and over 60% of those are female. Carter explained that his player stood a better chance going to Jail than college. Once the Progress Reports were published, six of his players were failing at least one or more of their classes. So Carter at 16-0, undefeated and headed to the state championships, locked the gym doors and started forfeiting games; turning basketball practice sessions into tutoring lessons for the players. This is when the sh@# hit the proverbial fan..In the semblance of Stand and Deliver, Remember the Titans, and Hoosiers, Coach Carter is another story about one man against insurmountable odds, bound and determined to make a difference in someone else's life, even if that someone isn't seeking change (well, at first anyways). In doing so, he changes that person today, and for generations to come. Coach Carter is raw at times, and might not be as good as other that I've mention; however, it's a story well told, and I did enjoy it.http://farisreel.com",Coach Carter
53,jaddison383,A GREAT Sports Movie,8,11 March 2007,"There's no denying that in today's day and age the sports movie genre has become tired and clichéd. Every year we see more attempts by Hollywood to cash in on the same 'inspiring' story, again and again. But from this defunct genre comes Coach Carter, a wonderful little film and probably one of my favorite sports movies.Samuel L. Jackson superbly plays Coach ken Carter, a controversial high school basketball coach who locks his players out of the gym when they don't uphold contracts concerning their academics. Jackson is a revelation here, playing a really good guy and turning in one of the best performances of his career. Met with opposition even from the staff, he fights for the idea of a student-athlete for the first time. Calm, cool, and dominating the screen, the film is worth seeing for Jackson's performance alone.Yet Coach Carter is something more. It's one of those rare sports movies that really hits home, avoiding most of the clichés that have messed up the genre. It's true, there's still the troubled athletes, the obligatory girlfriend-of-the-star; somehow Coach Carter isn't weighed down by it. In fact, quite the opposite, it's a movie that truly soars. 8/10 stars!Jay Addison",Coach Carter

55,Balthazar-5,'Hoosiers' meets 'Stand and Deliver',6,21 January 2005,"Sports films always at least have the advantage that artificial drama can always be conjured up from the uncertainty of the outcome of a particular sporting event. Films set in under-privileged neighbourhoods have the advantage that they are able to show us that there is good in all of us and we can overcome adversity, if only we try hard enough.Films that are both set in the ghetto and about sporting endeavour have, thus, two advantages. 'Coach Carter' milks its two advantages and turns out to be a highly entertaining, if unoriginal, pot-boiler. Jackson is fine as the tough-nut 'made good' former street kid given the job of beating a bunch of apparent no-hoper school basketball players into shape. We get all of the social stuff... drugs, unwanted pregnancies, academic under-achievement. That's par for the course.We also get some excellent sidebar characters, like a realist head-mistress who turns idealist, and a massively over-weight mother who dominates her tough-nut son.The film is, finally, just an amalgam of 'Hoosiers' (1986) and 'Stand and Deliver' (1988) - both substantially superior films. It is, however, worth the price of admission for the ride.",Coach Carter
56,hooma814,Powerful and moving,8,23 July 2020,"I remember Coach Carter being quite good, but the fact that I forgot that it was Samuel L Jackson leading probably meant it had been too long and was worth a rewatch. And wow this movie is great. It has some of the best sport actions shots I've seen in any movie. It spends a lot of time actually showing the play of the game as opposed to just showing cut shots of the basketball hoop or players getting ready to shoot. Instead it has many different games where the camera has a wide angle shot taking in many players and showing quite complicated scenes requiring a high level of skill. Noticeably Channing Tatum is absent in many of these scenes with his skills not being as good. This movie felt very real and therefore very moving.It was easy to connect with the characters and want to see them be successful. They did a great job of helping you to care about many players. So much so you got used to seeing the group of about 8 or so guys that when an extra pops in for team talks, you're left thinking whose that guy?Samuel L Jackson obviously smashes it. But in a way that isnt shouty or abusive like many of his other roles. Hes cool, decisive and carries such clear conviction. Although it is obviously a bit unrelatable with the Coach violently defending himself and smashing the kids head up against a wall. Being a teacher myself I sometimes wish I could put the fear of Samuel L Jackson into the naughty little tyrants that deserve it. But then you remember that youd get fired.Great all round performance from everyone. Especially for many of these actors who hadn't had much experience. Awesome movie",Coach Carter
57,HanShotFirstGR,"Inspirational, yet flawed movie!",7,6 March 2021,"Plot:Controversy surrounds high school basketball coach Ken Carter after he benches his entire team for breaking their academic contract with him.Analysis:Back in 2000s, feel-good inspiring movies started to expand and be a low-budget high profit choice for companies. It's the kind of movies you will probably see on TV on a Sunday afternoon and probably watch it with your parents or siblings expecting something to make you motivated. Sports movies are the most frequent example and that's where Coach Carter enters the discussion, a biographical story that deal with more than the actual sport and manages to have an impact on you.The key element to this movie's success was of course a magnificent Samuel L. Jackson that proves again that he can do more than being a mobster or the funny guy with the explicit lines. His performance as a coach struggling to make his player winners in life is not only inspiring but quite exceptional to be honest, he is extremely talented and manges to not only bring out the angry side of Mr. Carter but also the carring and emotional one too. A very underrated actor that is famous as the Jules of Pulp Fiction, Nick Fury of Avengers or Mace Windu of Star Wars but never got enough attention for this little gem of a role, a more serious and more important one to be honest.The rest of the cast isn't something special to be honest, Rick Gonzalez, a young Channing Tatum, Robert Richard, Rob Brown, Nana Gbewonyo and Antwon Tanner, everyone did a fine job, they weren't bad at all but there wasn't enough conent to build their performances on, very basic personallities and back stories, just enough to not be faceless random people and despite their efforts the final result is just okay and nothing more.The plot is in fact very motivational it makes you believe in the existance of visionary people, those who care about making a difference in other ones' lives, it shows how tough love is sometimes the one thing that has the best results in making people fight for a better tomorrow. Some fault are inevitable, especially those which are caused by the lack of runtime, making a movie means making sacrifices of some parts of the story to develop others, in this case the creators sacrificed the depths of the kids' personalities to have the whole case analyzed enough and that is not a major problem but it does keep you very far from the story as you can't relate to anyone.It's really difficult to review this one. On the one hand is the amazing emotional core that Carter's character forms perfectly, on the other hand it lacks the technical aspects to call it great. Of course in the end, this movie is a very positive experience that deserves a chance but it's a pity that mini series weren't a thing back then because this story would definetely benefit from one.Conclusion:Very nice, heartwarming sports movie that focuses on important stuff but in the end missed greatness due to lack of time and some questionable creative stories. Compared to other sports films is one of the good, it just doesn't make it to the great ones. A very rewarding experience, just not one that will make you feel something special enough to praise it as a great film.Rating: 7.5/10",Coach Carter
58,TheGOLDENWALRUS,This isn't a sports movie as much as it's a life changing story,8,7 February 2007,"What can I say about samuel L Jackson. He doesn't read scripts anymore when he picks roles it seems like. Until this movie he finally redeemed himself from movies like The Man and In My country. This was a great film.Jackson plays a coach that is more interested in having kids do well in school and stay off the streets than playing some basketball. He doesn't care if he has to bench the best player for failing a subject and goes to extreme lengths to represent that. The basketball is the sub-plot while trying to get kids to college and not killed is the main plot.Jackson did a great job while still showing off his attitude such as when he tied his shoes and says ""I tied that $hit!"" This to tell the team to stop mouthing off to the other team. Great movie.",Coach Carter

BOY was I surprised at how great it was!One might easily get the impression that this is just another ""New Unorthodox Coach Turns Gang of Misfits Into Champions"" kind of movie and one would be right... up to a point. However, at that point this movie takes off and accelerates to a much higher plane of story-telling. Characters steadily develop from people you might first despise (rude punks) into proud, respectable young men.Yes, the movie starts out predictably enough but it only uses that ""New Coach for Bad Team"" cliche to get the ball rolling (or bouncing I should say).The performances are all fantastic and mostly by relative unknowns as they were primarily cast based on their athletic abilities and it really shows. The actual game sequences are phenomenal and the actors themselves are the ones actually on the court doing those amazing things! The games are exciting and nail-biting. You really feel for the players.But the real message of this story is in how the coach puts life lessons and education first. Even as the last-rated team becomes a top contender, that isn't enough for the coach to ignore their failing grades and over-confident, cocky attitudes. No, he sets them straight and in the end, they love him for it.This is one of the most uplifting movies I've seen in a long time. If you love a great sports movie with a lot of heart and based on real life, then you will probably enjoy this film. Heck, even if you don't like sports you will probably enjoy it.Definitely watch the ""special features"" if you can view it on DVD. It is almost as much fun as the movie... and it will make you appreciate the movie even more as well.",Coach Carter

Eventually it arrived and it was well worth the wait. Some will say that it is a familiar story. New teacher bad kids and the new teacher turns them into good kids. However this is not fiction it actually happened. I found this film totally absorbing and while it is a long film it was even longer for me as such was the emotional impact of some of the scenes I found myself watching them again and again. It is extremely satisfying to know that there are people like Coach Carter out there and even more uplifting that in this day and age, there are kids that are willing to listen and learn. The academic achievements of kids throughout the world would be changed for the better if there were more Coach Carters out there and without sounding too sugary, the world would be a better place. A very good film for adults (to take note, we can all be coach carters in our own way) and one all parents should encourage their children to see.",Coach Carter
67,katydid4819,'Carter' Coached By Formula,7,21 February 2005,"Coach Carter ***/*****There have been a slew of sports stories to hit the multiplex in the last few years. They all have enough in common that we get tired of them yet they each have their own ""thing"" that makes them unique enough that we go to see them just to see what this story has that the others didn't. The inspirational, uplifting, based on a true story sports tales are a dime a dozen because, essentially, every athlete is one of these stories. What makes the boys of Friday Nigh Lights any different that your local high school football team? What makes coach Carter's players any different than any other teenage boys?In the latest version of 'talented players with bad coach get good coach and start winning', Samuel L. Jackson plays coach Cater who comes to coach at his old high school where more kids end up in prison that end up with college diplomas. He is on a mission not only to improve the game record for the basketball team but to also improve the academic standing of his players. The boys live in a predominantly poor black neighborhood and all the stereotypes of this lifestyle show up to bat. Boy who's girlfriend is pregnant, the tough guy who hangs with his older cousin and gets into trouble although the camera makes it painfully obvious that he will be ""saved"" in the end and the one who tries to be that ""savior"". Perhaps the movie shouldn't be ridiculed for following formula. After all, that is what sells and if movies didn't make back their costs, we'd have to find new ways to spend Friday nights. But the problem with formula is that we get tired of it when it's over used and man oh man is this formula getting old. It's almost akin to watching the day in life of anybody played before your eyes over and over and over again. You know who is going to say what, when and why and after a while you stop caring. The inspirational speeches coaches give at halftime of the pivotal game don't actually exist, you know.But, like romantic comedies, horror and thriller films, when formula is twisted in some way or another, the movies are better than those that never had a pattern to work with in. The Sixth Sense is the classic horror film with a twist. It just happened to be such a good twist that it essentially became its own sub-genre of thriller films. A film like Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind is just a romantic comedy. It's justbackwardsand sideways. Whatever. The point is that it's a distorted version of what we're used to and, as a result, it has become a film with a growing fan base that is loyal to the extent that they might as well be called a cult. Coach Carter, although not exactly revolutionary in the ways these two films are, had a chance to be. There is an entire sub-plot devoted to the academic progress of the basketball players. ""They're student athletes. Student comes first."" The point where this story is wrapped up also coincides with an ending of sorts to the athlete story. If, at this point, the filmmakers had chosen to end the film, they would have created a story more about the student than the athlete, making them not just another based on a true story sports film.",Coach Carter

As the title suggests, it is basically ""Lean on Me"" (Morgan Freeman) merged together with ""Miracle"" (Kurt Russell).Of course the sport here is basketball instead of ice hockey, but the story is very good.Jackson's performance was solid as expected and the supporting cast made the story believable.

Many others (including his co-workers, players on his team, etc.) find his methods extreme and ultimately don't support them.At first, it looks as though the movie will be nothing but clichés, and following a by-the-numbers routine of other films with a similar storyline.

71,theguys1,"the best basketball movie ever, probably the best movie ever",10,30 June 2005,Coach Carter is based on a true story about a man who coaches a team of innercity boys and tries to save them from a horrible future by administrating strict rules and limits. This is a fantastic movie and it is the absolute best true story ever told. Every minute of this motion picture was exhilarating and pure. It teaches a fantastic lesson about life and why not to have premarital sex. Samuel L. Jackson is at his best in acting with this movie. The character of Ken Carter talks with such thorough description which makes the movie what it is. One of my two favorite movies includes this outstanding cinematic experience. 10/10*,Coach Carter

73,RandomTask-AP,To Sir with Rebounds,7,29 January 2005,"On the field, rink or court, the team that does the most unexpected thing or who tries the newest strategy doesn't necessarily define the game being played. More often, it is about the rigorous execution of practiced skills and knowing how to keep your weaknesses from getting in your way. This straightforward and almost military approach that identify both the character of Coach Ken Carter (Samuel L. Jackson) and the movie about him and the underprivileged basketball team. The solid performances from the cast make this movie a good addition to the genre of inspirational teacher fables.The Richmond High basketball team is facing the very real possibility of another season in the dumps as they look back at their previous record of 4 wins and 22 losses. Their very tired coach has been working for several years and has sought out alumnus and state record-holder Ken Carter to be his replacement. Carter takes the job in spite of the small money and large time commitment because of his love of the game and discipline. More details are revealed later in the movie, but giving them away here would only undermine Jackson's strong performance. The new Coach moves in; kicks out the trouble-makers (who, coincidentally, are also the team's highest scorers); offers the remaining team an athletic and academic contract; and begins practice with the rigor and tenacity of a Marine. Soon, there is insight into the off-court lives of the players. From its introduction, the Richmond School is obviously one of the poorer of California's school districts even though it is part of the city of San Francisco. There are dates, dances, and hot bodies at parties (which, as part of an MTV Films production, are edited in flashy fashion), but the looming realities of poverty, crime, drugs and family are faced here. For Cruz (Rick Gonzales), drugs are an easy payday, but he wants something more after he gets kicked off of the team. Damien Carter (Robert Ri'chard), the coach's son, wants to play for his father, but must survive the social shock of transferring from an expensive college prep school to the rough halls of Richmond. Although Kenyon (Rob Brown) has won both the heart and bed of Kyra (Ashanti), her unplanned pregnancy threatens to overwhelm them. Director Thomas Carter, who is said to have no relation to the real-life Coach Carter, does an excellent job of balancing all the subplots while showing the boys growing as players and as a team under Coach Carter's direction. He does train and lead the team to a 16-and-0 record before the house comes tumbling down from its rickety academic pilings. The Coach confronts parental dissent and faces faculty resistance when he tries to follow up on his players' grades, which must be higher than school requirements for the sake of athletic scholarships. When the Coach gets the reports only to learn that the players are falling far short of their goal, he locks the gym, cancels games and sets up tutoring in lieu of practice. The ensuing conflict is the true climax of the film, and it smartly avoids making any single character a villain. The students' choice ultimately makes the difference, and the movie continues to a second court-side climax which feels more like an epilogue. However, could you really make a Hollywood film about high school basketball end anywhere except at a big game? The cast of ""Coach Carter"" is the film's real strength over its director. Thomas Carter is an able film maker, but he sticks to the basics and uses slow motion shots to create emotional emphasis a bit too often. No real ground is broken in the genre here. Of course Samuel L. Jackson brings tremendous weight, strength and passion to Ken Carter. Those characteristics are the backbone most of the movie's events, and it is easy to see how he was chosen and why he accepted the role. Without a team about whom the audience can care, Coach Carter would just be a loud and frustrated man wasting his time with a bunch of teenagers. They are all allowed to give their characters definition and range. The moments they take to shrug, joke, glance all enhance each performance, and illustrate how small choices define each of them. The whole group interacts organically. This is not just about how to win the championship and get the popular girl to go to the dance. These players are people who are faced with uncomfortably limited choices that will doubtlessly affect the course of their lives. Having a release date early in the year is typically a sign of ""no confidence"" from a studio to a film, but ""Coach carter"" seems stronger than the typical January film. The director may not be the most artistic or risky, but he opens all the right doors for the story and the cast. It is a strong story that succeeds in illustrating hard won inspiration. 7 out of 10",Coach Carter
74,ratpackaustin,Revolutionizes the way kids see the game,10,18 February 2019,"I know I'm very late in leaving a review, but I first saw this movie about 6 years ago (I was in 8th grade). My dad handed it to me and told me to watch it because I love sports movies, and oh man did this movie captivate what I love about sports. Sports aren't just a collision of sweaty bodies for the entertainment of others, it's about teamwork and being successful in and off the court. This is what ""coach carter"" does so well, it's a basketball movie but it's not about basketball. ""Coach carter"" instead focuses on the integrity of a basketball coach and how he refuses to let his players be just another statistic in a failing educational system. This story spoke to me from the first viewing and shows everyone who watches it that sports does not make you who you are, and that we as people are above the game. Overall this is a beautiful movie about the hardships of those who only have the game of basketball left in their lives. Every performance is amazing (specifically Jackson as coach carter and Rick Gonzalez as Timo Cruz). Please watch this movie especially if you love basketball, it will leave tears in your eyes.",Coach Carter

At the end of the movie I was almost going to cry. I loved the movie so much. It wasn't just about basketball, about the story of the greatest basketball coach that ever lived. I loved the move, it was inspiring sad movie with some violence. I think there were about 80 people in the theatre and about 75 ended up crying at the end of the movie.

76,DemiRonin,A fairly mediocre film. Can't really say much besides that.,5,16 April 2011,"The film centers around Richmond High school which is underfunded and has only a 50% graduation rate. Coach Carter played by Samuel L Jackson is a former alumni to the school comes in to take over the coaching position in his first season. The film doesn't have a central character but goes with an ensemble cast. The characters include the coach's son, a student drug dealer, a illiterate student, a teen pregnancy and etc etc. I guess what separates this film from a normal basketball film is that Coach is very stringent on the grades his students must keep. Coach Carter sends the message that basketball is not the only trophy worthy of chasing for these at risk teenagers. The acting is alright, no breakthrough performances. Some people have said that Samuel Jackson is great and.... he's okay, but we've seen better in other films. Unless you're in a basketball mood, it's not really worth watching. I has good messages and good lessons to be learned but the drama is just not there. It's not gut wrenching and your not going to be at the edge of your seat to see what happens next. The film plays out very stereotypically with very few surprises. But..... at least it's not terrible :P",Coach Carter
77,stephenpaultaylor,1000 Pushups!,6,26 January 2016,"This is the story of a coach who bucks the system to ensure that the players on his basketball team not only become a stellar team, but attain a good education to boot. It's another one of those paint-by-number sports movies with a tough-as-nails coach and a rebellious team that he has to whip into shape. The film puts the spotlight on an education system that places more emphasis on producing winning players than producing winning students with lots of opportunities in life.It's not a bad movie, but it's not a great movie. It's predictable. You know the ending from the start of the movie. That's not a terrible thing, considering that in movies like this, often it's the journey that counts more than the end product. It's a movie full of life lessons and messages about teamwork, fulfilling your personal destiny and ambitiously pursuing goals without being complacent. The film has a good moral backbone.There are more than enough syrupy, cringe-inducing moments to choke a horse. The movie relies heavily on sentiment and cliché to drive its point home. Every movie has the potential of really being a piece of art, but when a film relies on overused tropes, it satisfies the audience without challenging them. Therefore, the movie never feels like it's doing something new. The movie is filmed well. It looks great. It's crisp and full lof fluid camera movements.. From the lighting to the sets, the movie is made well. The training Carter puts his team through is rough. You feel the pain of the team when they constantly have to endure suicide runs and pushups, but you also see the benefits of really striving to be your best. You see the benefits of practice, repetition and training. The sports scenes are well-choreographed and filmed. The characters are mostly likable. The contrast between Coach Carter and the principal is a strong element of the movie (she cares less about the kids' educations and more about having a winning team). At one point, the principal says something to the effect of ""Playing on this team could be the best time of their lives"". At this point, it hits you that these kids really don't have a chance to become anything with a school system that sees them as simply members of a winning team as opposed to young people full of potential.This is what sets Coach Carter apart from other sports movies. The Coach has a goal that is bigger and nobler than simply having a winning team. He cares about the kids and their futures. The scenes with Samuel Jackson are strong, for the most part. He's a good actor; convincing, solid and a force to be reckoned with. However, a number of the other younger actors aren't good enough to carry a scene, which leaves the movie feeling patchy. A lot of the dialogue feels recycled and trite. For example, there is a scene with a needy basketball player trying to convince his ""pregnant"" girlfriend to work things out with him. The dialogue feels like it's lifted straight from a soap opera. It doesn't ring true. It's an okay movie. It's not amazing. It's not a great piece of art. It's capable filmmaking, decent acting and a worthwhile, if predictable story. It offers food for thought about the state of education in America today and Jackson's performance makes it worth watching. I'd give it a 6/10.",Coach Carter
78,artemis_5,"Violence, Poverty, and Basketball",7,2 May 2006,"I grew up 3 blocks from the Richmond border, and am all too familiar with the poverty, violence, and desperation that plagues its residents. In Richmond, like in many parts of this country, young men cope with the rough environment in which they grew up by playing basketball (jerseys are sported by just about any boy under 22).Having gone to high school with these kids (or rather with the Richmond kids who were bussed to my local high school), I became familiar with their subculture. What struck me most about the movie was just how well it captured the boys that I knew from Richmond. Maybe urban culture is the same around the country, but having grown up near Richmond and San Pablo (another neighboring city), they were the only urban youth with whom I was familiar.By the way, in case anyone was wondering about the party in the wealthy neighborhood to which the Richmond basketball team was invited, here in the San Francisco Bay Area, the communities are so close together that it is not uncommon for kids from poorer areas to hang out in areas that are more affluent, or to go to parties in those areas. However, I have heard that in other parts of the country, the ""borders"" between urban areas and the suburbs are not as fluid.I do not remember reading about the dramatic victories of the Richmond High basketball team in the local paper, but I did take a community college class taught by an instructor who my mother told me once had Coach Carter in his class, and many of my clients have kids who were or are students at Richmond High.After seeing so many films about events that took place years ago and far away, it was refreshing to see an interesting film about a community with which I am somewhat familiar. This film is worth at least a rental, particularly if you are from the East Bay.On another note: Go, CAL Bears.....",Coach Carter

I really wanted to see what would happen to all of the young men on the team, and the team itself. It was predictable at times, but it is a great movie. I was more than surprised. A side note. This movie is really for all ages. It's rated PG-13 for the language, and maybe very brief drug dealing. No sexual content, certainly no nudity.

80,Filmcritic624,Winners At The Buzzer!,7,12 December 2005,"I've seen this movie a thousand times, but I've never gotten the time to write a review on it, but today, I'm able to, so, here goes.With a ""Hardball"" spin off, Coach Carter takes the team into another dimension of high school basketball. Where in the world there's the perfect coach with the perfect team, this world, in Richmond High School, is an imperfect world. Teeangersare raised by unwanted parents. College is almost a distant cry on the radar screen, and the foreseeable future is a doormat that's already been stepped on thousands of times, there's nothing that's in sight for a team that can never seem to stop losing, until their's a job vacancy for the coaching job after the original coach for the team resigns (I would understand why).Ken Carter (Samuel L. Jackson) steps up to the plate and is handpicked by the school to be the successor for the school basketball team, as their coach. He accepts the job, and almost immediately, his presence is felt by both the players and school, as the players are being treated by prisoners, worked like animals, and rode on like horses. With all the calamity going on, Carter turns the teams into winners, enabling an undefeated record, until he notices that his team has another problem. Grades.After finding out that the majority of his students are barely passing (or even failing) their courses, Carter locks out the gym and practice, putting chains on the gym doors, forfeiting games, and locking his students in the school library until the grades start to show improvement. To insure that his players are to get better, and to put pressure on them to be better, Carter demands that all the players' teachers issue weekly progress reports on their grades. Could this all try and help the players become better students, or in Carter's case, men? Can he help get his players into a decent college without getting arrested (and hopefully not gunned down)? That's all up in the air as the parents get restless, and the district decides that to end the lockout, Carter must resign his coaching position to allow the students to play...All of this may make this movie sound like its a dark, depressing teen movie, but its not. Its a movie that uplifts the courage of man, and shows that people need to try hard in order to succeed, to not throw in the towel just because they cannot do it. Life was not made like the yellow-brick road. Life was made with many challenges, and if you cannot leave up to them, you might as well end up sitting your tush in prison, because you're not willing to accept full responsibility.Jackson delivers a stand-up performance in this movie (not surprising at all), and director Thomas Carter (no relation to the real coach), shows a potential director in him, as despite some well known clichés are used in the film, let's not get carried away with them, as the movie has more ups, than it does down. It focuses also on racial equality, as derogatory words are used as enemies, not as allies, and enable a more substantial taste and flavor to the movie that was based on a true story.Stand up, cheer, do whatever you feel is right.

No one needs another one of these, and will just added to the list of forgotten jockey movies and just be added to the bin. I'm not saying the acting was bad I'm saying the movie was bad as hell.

Need a movie that's only good because just like the others, it has Samuel L Jackson? Well, just watch number 109. Yes, the sports movies have gotten so overwritten that they have numbers now. Can you say this is this is an exception because the coach cares about the boys? No – just filler while we have them almost beat the team in the finals but the lose?

The success in overcoming the formulaic accusations, and perhaps the basis for those accusations, probably lies in th fact this is based on a true story. An outstanding movie in almost every way.The only drawback for me is its persistent profanity.

As far as this one goes, I felt throughout the whole thing that I had seen something like this before; which is probably true. The acting was mediocre, S.L Jackson acts the same as he does in all his now typecast roles. The predictability in the movie is astounding, which spoiled it for me for the most part.

The reason he takes these kids under his wing is because he realize that they need a help if they wanna grow up, finish school and have a life they deserve.This is a very touching story, and educational as well, which shows the way kids struggle nowadays, and how teachers are quitting on them.

POSSIBLE SPOILER****The newly hired basketball coach, Ken Carter, wants that jocks excel not only athletically but academically as well. He wants to change the ages-old way of educating youngsters whose primary interest is other than academic realm. And his mindset and his peculiar way of trying to accomplish his goal are radically opposed by the predominantly low-class community. Carter is an open-minded man. He's caring, willing to take risks, he behaves himself and is well-accepted at first. But at his workplace his strictness, his rigid set of rules and the severity of his punishments are simply incomprehensible to the community's level of understanding. And this is the point when the jarring effect of misunderstandings and objection leads to condemnation, attack, trial and finally closes up with regret and submission to the Carter's rules. He wanted smart kids and smart athletes. And he got them only when the parents and adults questioned their own selves if they wanted to live with smart kids & athletes and be proud of them or be surrounded by rascals and delinquents who could only help the rate of crime rise and jeopardize their own lives.

The two lovers finally come up with a way to support the kid...and she goes and aborts it. What message is that trying to send? I know it's just a movie, but there were several supposedly ""tense"" scenes that I had to restrain myself from bursting into laughter. Scene #1-The drug dealer dies. And this is a tragedy why? I'm supposed to feel sorry for this person that get's gunned down when he's only been on the screen for five minutes and has made the impression of a very disreputable and unlikeable person. I guess I should feel sorry for worm or whatever his name is...but doesn't his cousin's death remove that unhealthy element in worm's life?Scene #2- Worm's supposedly heartwarming monologue that was never really developed in the movie. I get the fact the he had inner conflict throughout the movie, I just never really seemed to care. And during his little diatribe in the gym (with the desks, etc.) I kept wondering: When did this solid F student, ex-drug dealer become a philosopher? Did he look up every word he's saying in the dictionary 5 minutes before coach Carter enters the gym? why doesn't the audience see that so it makes more sense?Basically the movie boils down to this-it has a good message, Samuel L.

Cliché philosophy and lines such as ""I met you as boys and now you're men"" are given pride of place is this film, but for entertainment value and moral fortitude, you can't go far wrong with this effort from the director of Save the Last Dance.The problem with the film as a media text is that it does not stand up to deconstruction. Behind the camera is a director who has no distinctive style. The action packed basketball scenes spice up this drama but never excel beyond music video quality, which is not an insult. The editing is snappy and mixed with the basketball beat of hip hop, the energy of the matches being truly communicated, but no effort is made to do something new with the camera angles. The way to enjoy this film is not to look beneath the surface, instead just allowing yourself to be carried away by the innocent excitement of simplicity.Coach Carter was always going to need a strong lead to gain the substance that is has done. The no nonsense and iron willed demeanour that Samuel L. Jackson brings to the role makes him ideal for putting across the image of a man who can hold court in front of these hard life ghetto teens. What Jackson also brings is an amusing aggressive streak that make the audience glad they are not in the gym with this psycho who, despite pounding his players with endless 'submissions', still locks the gym when their grades don't come through.Carter is a difficult character to understand. He seems ready to refuse entry to hard nut bad boy Timo Cruz (Rick Gonzalez), but caves in when Junior Battle (Nana Gbewonyo) turns up at his shop with his mother and begs forgiveness. As the film progresses however, we learn that Carter is doing everything he can to get his players into college and gain a life worth living, presumably to become what Carter himself has.The players Carter strives to impact upon succumb easily to Carter's will. Occasional outbursts punctuate what is mostly a submissive relationship between coach and team and director Thomas Carter seems focused on delivering a realistic ensemble rather than the typical teen comedy entourage of weird and outrageous characters. It is a little unnerving being thrown into a gym with an unbreakable coach and a group of muscular teenagers who need to work to get average grades and can't roll off witty one-liners like the teenagers in other films in the genre. This decision to communicate realism is brave, but gives the film an enhanced depth that makes the lesson learned at the end more heart warming and honest. The ending is one of the film's three pointers, going against not only the conventions of the genre, but of Hollywood.What lacks is subplot development. Timo Cruz's drug running is given screen time between matches but ends abruptly. Cruz shoots from being a hard case to being a shivering wreck on Carter's doorstep, in need of a strong father figure which I suppose we are to assume Cruz does not have. A little background here would not have been amiss. Cruz's doorstep tears also bring to attention the relationship between Carter and his son Damien (Robert Ri'chard), which appears very son-and-sir in nature. There is a hint of tension beneath the surface that we glimpse at when Damien arrives late at practise, and there may also have been an undertone of jealousy when Carter hugs Cruz, but this is not elaborated upon and there is a slight emptiness in their bond.However, Coach Carter remains entertaining throughout. Realism and drama team-up to hit home hard the lessons that the team learn. Their struggle to overcome the stigma of their stereotypes is captured patiently, yet there is never a dull moment. Samuel L. Jackson brings a mountainous presence to his role that allows the audience to feel the film's extremes of pride and disappointment to a great extent. Involving emotionally and arresting dramatically, but superficial textually (although points awarded for fearlessness in parts of the subject matter).Rating: 3/5 By Joshua Morrall",Coach Carter
92,boltons-1,More Coach Carter content,8,13 July 2005,"Coach Carter is a good sports movie. The fact that it is based upon a true story makes it more compelling. It revolves around tough love and the idea that if you do thousands of push-ups and thousands of suicides (wind sprints) then you will develop the necessary respect for yourself and your fellow man. Ahh if everyone would just go to boot camp then wouldn't the world be a better place? I liked that this movie asked the question, ""what really is a student athlete?"" The answer is that in today's schools ""student athlete"" is an oxymoron unless a contract is signed and enforced. And it is the enforcing of this contract that made this an unique sports movie.Samuel L. Jackson is well cast and gives an excellent performance although in some scenes I was wondering if he was still training Jedi Knights.During the filming of the ""big"" basketball games it appeared several of the cameramen were having seizuresthe equivalent of my wife operating our camcorderor maybe it was just the editor who was seizing? Although Ashanti is really nice to look at I wasn't sure why her character was necessary to tell the story. Either her influence on the team (not just an individual) and the plot needed to be integrated better or her character should have been scaled down or cut.I would have liked to have seen more about what made Coach Carter take the job (he was only paid $1,500 a season) and more on why he didn't have his son enroll in Richmond in the first place instead of sending him to a private school. I already know about drugs on the street and teenage pregnancy through many other films. What I don't know enough about is what motivates a Coach Carter type personality and in turn why there are so few like him.The objective of life is not to try to reach one's peak during high school sports but rather to be prepared for the long haul. This movie conveys this message well but I still would have liked to see more of Coach Carter off the court and less of the basketball players off the court.",Coach Carter
93,dweber34,"Great movie, not completely based on fact",8,24 January 2006,"I couldn't help but enjoy this movie, and it is still in heavy rotation on my 12-year old daughter's DVD selection. But, having lived 17 blocks from Richmond High in 1999 when the actual events were taking place, it's tough to ignore a lot of the differences between fact and fiction.For starters, the Oilers school colors were changed from Red, White and Blue to suspiciously Hoosiers-like maroon and gold. While Richmond High is a rough school, its gym is hardly the bleak facility depicted in the movie. In reality, it is well-lit if shopworn version of a typical California suburban 1960s-era gym. Its as though director Thomas Carter wanted to out-ghetto the ""Carver High"" gym he grew up in as Hayward on ""The White Shadow."" Although the movie does touch on this with the ""hearing"" scene and the scene in which the players mock Carter's press conference, Kenny Carter and his antics were not universally appreciated. Nor was he, as shown, the sole positive force in these kids' lives. The true athletes' names, with the exception of little Carter, Damien, were changed in the movie. One actual player, Chris Dixon, played in the NFL later for the Oakland Raiders... makes you think there may have been an influential football coach somewhere in his life, don't you think? Also, the whole time line was screwy. As a long-time high school and college coach, I had difficulty with the old coach -- a pretty close depiction of one-time Oiler coach Roy Rogers by the way -- working the first game while Damien plays for ""St. Francis"" (another fiction, the only St. Francis in the Bay Area is down on the Peninsula in the Central Coast Section and would not have met RHS in the North Coast Section playoffs; nor for that matter would any of Richmond's playoff games have taken place in San Francisco. The NCS is all East and North Bay schools) only to see Carter step in in mid-season and his son transfer in mid-year and play for Richmond (illegal by California Interscholastic Federation rules). The movie shows a school dance held on campus. That is not something most inner-city schools in California attempt; they have the annual proms like everyone else... off campus in classy venues. Friday night school dances have become a casualty of the same crime-ridden social setting ""Coach Carter"" portrays. It was also irritating to have the singer Ashanti play Kenyon's girlfriend with a thick New York accent... and to have the entire movie shot in Long Beach and other LA-area locations rather than making the 350-mile trip up to Richmond to shoot it where it happened.On an emotional level, the movie was awesome. When movies are portrayed as true stories, though, I wish more attention to detail was paid. Socially-conscious dramas seem particularly prone to poetic license. In ""Hurricane"" the white fighter who beats RUBEN Carter is depicting as getting a scandalous we-wuz-robbed decision. In Ruben Carter's autobiography, though, he bitterly blames his manager for putting him in that fight, one in which he knew he was over matched. Now, as I understand it, the new blockbuster ""Glory Road"" manipulates the facts of Don Haskins coaching career and the score at various points of the 1966 NCAA championship game.Making ""true"" sports movies is a bit like fudging the facts of one's one playing career... those box scores are out there in black and white, waiting to disappoint those who believed you. The same for ""period"" pieces in which the ""period"" is less than a decade back and a lot of people who were there are still around.Still, Coach Carter reaches a lot of people... We now live in a suburban neighborhood in another state, far from RHS and the kids my daughter plays AAU ball with like to do the ""Rich-WHAT? Rich-MOND!"" chant and are amazed that we lived near such a fabled place.",Coach Carter

In a school, you are supposed to study not play a kids ball game. If you want to play ball, go to a neighbourhood court.

Actually it took play in the Bay Area, Richmond California (which was even mentioned in the movie). But anyway, this is a very touching story of a coach who won't give up on not just a team, but a generation of confused teens growing up in the streets of the inner-city.. a man who felt that school was more important than holding on to dreams one may not achieve due to improbability. he took these this value to a Richmond high school, where he and the team had life changing experiences.. I totally recommend getting it on DVD, this is by far, MTV's most realistic movie IMO.. 9/10, i enjoyed it a lot..",Coach Carter
98,yousoldmysoulforpogs,Better than you may expect; A noble film.,6,22 August 2008,"Impressed by a clip of this film showing Carter's hardened approach to training his players on Film4's daily preview, I decided to sit down and watch this film.As the opening credits took place, two features stood out: (1) the MTV Films logo; and (2) 'Based on the life of Ken Carter'. As the film started, I admittedly began to dread attempting to watch this film, but I hoped that by viewing all the events portrayed in the film as being true, the film would surpass my initial prejudice.All I can say is that this is a good film, and a cut above everything else of its nature. Its message of determination and success is clear and welcomed, and its actors (young and old) prove to be convincingly genuine. As far as the plot goes, although it does slow down a bit after the end of the tournament, it eventually picks up and proves to be a great story overall. This film certainly showed me.Okay, the film isn't exactly a masterpiece. It's not the most thought-provoking of films, nor is it an emotional roller-coaster like the best films are. However, the film succeeds at achieving what it set out to do - to tell the true story of a man determined to never deny his beliefs, and by doing so, give hopeless kids a better future. I can't help but respect the characters in what they achieve through the course of the film, and I hope that if you watch the film that you do too.",Coach Carter

First, All of the guys were fine!!!!, and they had their shirts off for a lot of the movie, so of course i enjoyed it. This movie is good, but a lot of people probably won't like it (because of there age), it is more for teenage girls or basketball players. This movie is sad at times and ultimately hilarious,and a good movie. I do recommend this movie to any teenager who is looking for a funny entertaining movie to see with friends.

This movie targets every part of teenage life when you are growing up in a place like Richmond. Drug Dealing, alcohol, guns, and teenage pregnancies are all targeted in this film. I think this is a great inspirational movie for teenagers all over the world; train hard= Good things happen, study hard= Great things happen. The only flaw that I could find in this movie was that the character ""Kyra"" played by Ashanti says that she will get an abortion this will tell young pregnant girls that it is okay to have abortions (its not). All the actors performed spectacularly, Sammuel L. Jacksons never seizes to amaze me in his roles. All the basketball players performed amazingly, dunking and whatever.So in the end, this is a GREAT film and I highly recommend that if you haven't seen it you better get your a*s to the video store and buy it, you will NOT be disappointed.",Coach Carter

His portrayal of Coach Carter was top notch and I found he believably instilled confidence in the Oilers Basketball team, in the same way the real Coach Carter most likely would have. This movie can certainly be enjoyed by people who have no interest in basketball, or even sports for that matter. He teaches the players not only to win and be humble about it, but also to become more knowledgeable through education, learning respect and discipline were all just as vitally important. Coach Carter had a set plan on how to not only make the team of players he had better athletes, but also to give them a fighting chance of surviving the outside world once or if they were accepted into college. Despite percentages showing that kids from the Richmond area were more likely to end up in jail than to succeed, he took his chances by making even the most unthinkable dreams for some of the players a reality. For the few of you who are knocking this film (or intend to), saying things like ""it was a snore fest"" or ""Samuel's worst role"", you are by far in the minority and your pointless comments are quite simply falling on deaf ears.

106,storewars,A Chead Imitation Of A Sports Movie!,1,26 February 2006,"Coach Carter is one of the worst movies of 2005! The Theatrical Trailer made it look like a great movie about college basketball, when it really was a cheap imitation of one! All it is, is just a movie about college basketball players and their dirty lives! For example, after winning the victory, the players went to a party with girls they had never met in their lives, even though they had girlfriends back at home. Don't be fooled by this movie's great looks, and inspiring Starr's. Never judge a book by it's cover, in other words, never judge a movie by it's looks! If i were you, i wouldn't waste my time, and good money on a movie like this! This movie is like a scam on the internet!

107,bi0h4z4rd,"Good movie, but...",7,13 January 2005,"Samuel L. Jackson is one of my favorite actors and I absolutely respect him and he was excellent. However, the storyline drifted several times. The movie is called ""Coach Carter"" not ""Some black man who doesn't want his girlfriend to have a baby."" That's all side crap that we don't need to know. I came to watch a movie about basketball and see Mr. Jackson kick some ass, not see some 25yo men play 18yo's in another version of Dawson's Creek, also known as, Adults who pretend to play Teens.Overall, the movie was good. I loved Mr. Jackson, he was excellent. At one point I almost expected to hear, ""I don't remember asking you a god damn thing... sirs.""It's another one of those, because your black you deserve better type movies.Sameul L. Jackson's performance was very well done, I give him a 7.5 of 10.

This is a must-see movie not only for inner city kids and their parents but for everyone. It shows that when athletes are challenged intellectually as well as athletically they can surprise beyond expectations. Samuel L Jackson is excellent as Coach Carter. The principal athletes are very believable. The basketball scenes are good just not great. Carter's speeches to the players are believable and inspirational.

109,cool_as_ice14,One of the best movies around,10,24 October 2005,"This movie isn't just about sport but has an underlying moral message which is been shown throughout the film. Sport won't get you far unless your a great but study and hard work in school will get you everywhere. Enter, a town that is quite poor and a basketball team who just want to win. Once Ken Carter accepts the job, the whole team changes and it is for the better. Another message this film teaches is respect, at the beginning just after meeting the boys, Ken expresses a need for the boys to show respect not only for themselves but for their friends and elders. He does this by explaining how the word 'nigger' can be used as a degrading term and how by dressing themselves with respect, behaving respectfully isn't bad at all.As soon as I saw this film, I knew that I wanted to see it. It has everything that makes a great movie, action, great dialog and most importantly, a good moral message and in a time where morally corrupt movies are on the rise, a great movie like this is a rare find.Intiallly, my friends didn't want to see this movie with me as they thought it was boring, and too intense but after months and months of waiting, I finally hired it out on DVD and watched it.You can actually take things away from this movie and it has a very good morals which can be applicable to everyone.",Coach Carter

It manages to be realistic without the sex, foul language and extreme violence. This is an excellent family movie. I think this should be showed in schools. Okay, that's all I have to say.

Samuel L Jackson as Ken Carter is brilliant.The movie shows a lot of evolution in the characters, Carter included. When he is appointed basketball coach in a low socio-economic area where the choices are seemingly graduate or go to jail or end up to dead, the boys are rowdy, disrespectful and rude (there were a few n-words said). Carter gives them contracts to 'become a winner' outside of basketball; the only part of the contract that related to basketball was they had to wear a blazer and tie to games, along with hem them having to address him as 'Sir' to encourage respect. The most noticeable change in boys after the lockout was ended by the school board was when Carter nearly walked out. The boys were in the gym, not playing but studying because they endorsed his 'academics ahead of sports' philosophy. And they all called him Sir.Carter also changes, especially towards Timo Cruz who's cousin was shot dead. Carter takes him in and he doesn't have to do anything to prove that he has to be back in the team, because Carter knows Cruz doesn't want to end up like his cousin and a basketball scholarship would help him avoid that life.It's a great movie, with a fantastic ending.",Coach Carter
112,IndianaFord,Coach Carter Review.,7,24 January 2005,"Coach Carter is the story of a basketball coach who was persistent and had his priorities straight. The positive message the movie conveyed was that lives can be changed for the better through self discipline, hard work and the building of character. I was thinking to myself that the whole story was pretty believable, but then I looked into it and found it to be a true to life story so I guess it really is believable.Samuel L. Jackson put in a convincing performance as the strict Coach Carter, as did the rest of the cast members. The movie, itself, was reminiscent of Lean On Me. It was the same basic story with the disciplinary figure helping the distraught kids through life.I found it disappointing that the parent of the basketball team emphasized a mere game over something vastly more important, education. I rated this movie 7 of 10",Coach Carter
113,bigtp-1,Teaching Discipline and Values really Works,10,6 October 2012,"Coach Carter is an admirable giant of a man and I enjoyed this film tremendously! I love the way that he knew what his team of young men needed and then he stuck to his plan. In spite of phenomenal pressure to back down, he had them sign a contract that forced them to change their attitudes to the game and ultimately to life itself. The team were mainly ""lost"" young men whose lives were being dictated by their peers and circumstances, but CC had the solution. He helped them to learn respect for themselves and their community.In the end, I felt that this film was about understanding and teaching life values to a group who had lost their way. Once the team realised that the reason he was doing these things was because he cared about them, they began to bond and then acted like a proper team.In society today, we sadly see a breakdown in discipline and respect in the home and at school, it inevitably leads to unhappiness and misery for everyone concerned (read 2 Timothy 3:1-5).Today, many parents want their kids to be their friend first and so rarely say no to them, what the youngster really needs is a loving parent and firm guidance! Firm, loving discipline and relevant encouragement always works out for the best; our youngsters feel safer and they thrive knowing that we care about them don't they? They then grow into much more rounded and productive members of society. Most people who have seen this film have felt the warmth that Ken Carter had for his team and the way that he helped them realise their potential as men.

I wanted this movie to be better than it was, but when you start desperately trying to fool yourself into believing a movie is good, eventually it falls apart and you can see it for what it is.

I have read and heard so many comments about the morals and unacceptable behavior portrayed by some of the characters and in turn viewers bad-mouth the film simply because they do not agree with some of the behavior of the some of the characters in the film. But these people obviously missed the point of the film. Coach Carter was trying to instill values that he thought would help an entire community. The reality is that kids do have foul mouths, have unprotected sex, are faced with hard decisions (to have or not have a baby and selling drugs) everyday.We should all be so fortunate to have the opportunity to see a movie that features a person that actually tries to deal with these issues without making judgment calls and instead offer resolutions to problems. He offered resolutions to his team's behavior and left it to them to make the right decisions. This was good because they were able to see the consequences of their actions. When they made the right decision, they were able to see the positive consequences. When they made the wrong decision the players were faced with negative consequences and had no one to blame but themselves.The impact of a person of this magnitude is profound and if some viewers found fault with this movie simply because their reality is a little different at this moment then it was for the characters in this film is very unfortunate for the viewer. Because you never know when you might be faced with a person similar to that in the movie. You just might have to deal with this situation more personally than expected and if this happens what will you do? Because the consequences of your actions in a situation like this will be either positive or negative as well.",Coach Carter
123,mikey141,Samuel L Jackson + Basketball = Great film!,9,25 November 2012,"I first thought I'd see this film because it has Samuel L Jackson in, who is one of my favourite actors and I really like Basketball so I was sure to be entertained but I didn't expect it to be this good of a film! Samuel L Jackson was brilliant as Coach Carter and there was a good supporting cast.On-court the film is thrilling but I was surprised to find it just as sensational off the court but that is down to Jackson, the rest of the cast who do well to hold their own and some good storytelling.I've heard people complain about clichés within the film but it is very hard to not have them plus I had no problem with them and would rather it stayed with a formula which has been used many times and works well than change it completely.Overall this is a great film for anyone as it sends some important messages, is inspirational and a heart-warming sports drama if ever there was one.",Coach Carter
124,jayzeeth7,best basketball movie ever!,10,22 August 2005,"powerfully moving. magnificently crafted. the best basketball film made ever. Based on true events, this is the story of Coach Ken Carter who brought change into the lives of young and seemingly hopeless high school basketball players to go to college. Wonderfully made, it shows that one cannot be excellent in only one aspect of his life but in all other aspects as well. It encourages students to perform excellently in their academic life. The acting, direction and story are stupendous. You'll learn a lot from this movie. This movie is highly recommendable. Samuel L. Jackson must have an Oscar for this one! Never miss COACH CARTER!",Coach Carter
125,mazyare,A Great movie on the power of standing for what you believe in.,8,18 July 2008,"Great movie. The strong position that coach Carter maintains and the stand he was for the team was beautiful. One example is the scene where Timo Cruz was exhausted after having done so many ""suicides"" and push-ups and he didn't make all of them before that Fri (the due date), and he was quitting when others in the team stepped up for him and did push-ups and suicides. That came out of Carter standing for what he had asked Cruz to do and not stepping off his word because Cruz had done so many.It also demonstrates the power of creating the listening for someone (The old coach introducing coach Carter to the team mentioning his credentials and achievements).A few quotes:""You will have my respect, until you abuse it"".""... Now I cannot teach you the game of basketball until your conditioning allows me to do so.""",Coach Carter

It's a true shame because most movies are made for that demographic. I had much higher hopes for this film. To begin with, This is lazy storytelling. Anyone who thinks this is a classic needs to get out more. What studio exec bribed the critics into praising any aspect of this crap? I wanted this movie to be better than it was, but when you start desperately trying to fool yourself into believing a movie is good, eventually it falls apart and you can see it for what it is. In a case like this, the blame should not rest entirely on the director's shoulders. The screenwriter has to share equal responsibility; the characters are spouting his banal dialogue, and this drama sputters at an alarming rate.",Coach Carter

The sport's drama film directed by Thomas Carter and wrote by Mark Schwahn and John Gatins is a brilliant inspiring film that has it's ups and downs as the boys start to realise that education is important, especially for one boy as the boys start to realise that education is important, especially for one student Timo Cruz (Rick Gonzalez) who gets kicked out the team once and walks out on the team as well.

130,mjswooosh,Feel-Good movie that never quite gives you that warm and fuzzy feeling...,5,24 January 2005,"This is a story that deserves to be told and a movie that tries hard to be above average and probably could have been in the hands of a better director. Ultimately, however, it gets dragged down by a sub-par and cliché' ridden script, boring pacing, average-at-best character development, below average acting (except Sam Jackson who turns in a pretty good performance and makes it at least watchable), extremely poor basketball choreography, and choppy editing. This is, on the one hand, a movie about life. But the story as portrayed isn't as gripping as it should be and comes off like a melodramatic after-school special (stay in school kids, don't get your girlfriend pregnant, don't deal drugs, etc...). It has the right message, to be sure, but we've seen it done before a hundred and one times...and far better. Perhaps most telling was the fact that during scenes when Sam Jackson wasn't on screen I (and all 3 of the people I went to see the movie with) became extremely bored, extremely fast. To say Sam Jackson carried this movie is a huge understatement. The film tries to show us how the coach reaches these kids, but in the end it just doesn't have much of an impact. Why would we feel sorry for a drug-dealer who has been given so little screen time and is otherwise shown to be little more than a petty thug? Why would I care if Worm makes it? Short of his ridiculous and ultimately unbelievable Shakesperean soliloquy towards the end of the film, we're not really given any hint there is a single brain-cell in his head. A big part of the problem is that other than Sam Jackson the acting is extremely weak, and you absolutely need a strong ensemble cast to get a powerful emotional message across to an audience. Unfortunately, this film fails on almost all counts to help us relate to and care for these characters. In the end, the story just doesn't ""grab"" you like it should and that can only be chalked up to a whole host of things that went wrong to make this movie into another coulda, woulda, shoulda exercise in frustration.This is also a film about basketball, and had this portion of the film been exciting then perhaps it could have made up for the glaring weaknesses in the story-telling department. Ironically, I have a feeling the film-makers felt this way too so they decided to edit the basketball scenes into what they thought would be ""exciting"" in order to hold the audience's interest. Unfortunately, the result is that Coach Carter is an even bigger failure on the court than it is in the classroom: the on-court scenes themselves are choreographed amateurishly and obviously edited for today's PS2 crowd with the attention spans of gnats. Real basketball? You won't find much here. What you will find are plenty of dunks. Every basketball scene in this movie goes something like this: DUNK, DUNK, DUNK...3-pointer...DUNK, DUNK, DUNK...{show a couple seconds of Sam Jackson yelling something unintelligible on the sidelines}...DUNK, DUNK, DUNK. Rinse, repeat. YAWN. It doesn't help that virtually none of the actors on the team actually move like real basketball players on the court (especially ""Worm"" who is absolutely NOT an athlete). Perhaps this is why they edited it so much with quick cutaway shots...to cover for the athletic weaknesses of their actors. Is it that hard to find actors in Hollywood who have actually played a sport before and can look reasonably athletic doing it on film? I played 4 years of college basketball and have coached at various levels over the past 5 years since. While I am no John Wooden, I know a thing or two about the game and trust me...you won't find one nugget of actual basketball knowledge or wisdom, one ounce of reality with regards to how high school basketball is truly played. You won't find that magic moment when a coach is able to drag out perfect performances from a flawed team. What you will find is a steady dose of rim-rattling rams interspersed with shots of rump shaking cheerleaders banging out their dance-grooves to the latest hip-hop that altogether makes high-school basketball look like a Sportscenter dunk-a-th on-slash-music-video. The cheerleader shots were for some reason especially cheesy and bordered on camp, almost as if the film-makers knew they weren't producing a film that accurately portrayed basketball so they collectively figured, ""hey, screw it...let's just go whole-hog and turn high-school basketball into the XFL."" If the cheerleaders all had huge implants and rolled in mud during the games it wouldn't have been much more ridiculous. During the shoe-ad commercial gone insane basketball scenes, Coach Carter himself was given short shrift and constantly plays second-fiddle to the goings-on around him. In short, he never has a chance to really COACH. This is probably the film's biggest weakness on the court considering it IS supposed to be about COACH CARTER, after all.From what I have heard through the grape-vine Ken Carter is a wonderful man and the story of his exploits at Richmond high-school are indeed something special, so it's all-the-more sad that his impact on the lives of these children wasn't given a better realization on the big screen. Ultimately, Coach Carter has a below-average script that poorly realizes the real-life story combined with sub-par direction, a poor ensemble cast, and extremely unrealistic basketball choreography. In short, if you want to watch a movie about how basketball is really played then watch Hoosiers (or even Blue Chips...*shudder*). If you want to watch a movie about inner city kids succeeding against all odds watch Stand and Deliver. Despite the fact that I went into this movie with high hopes, it is really average at best and certainly not worth full admission price. Thank God I only paid to see a matinée. 5/10.",Coach Carter

Shut up) and I have to admit that I did NOT want to watch it at first because it was a sports movie. But upon viewing this movie, I found that I liked it and enjoyed it. I then swiped the movie from my father's house and watched it every night for 3 nights straight. Here are the things that caught my attention.1) Samuel L. Jackson. One of the greatest actors ever was in this movie so I was instantly drawn in and thought that I'd give it a chance.2) The Music. Loved the music even though the majority is rap. It fit the movie perfectly.3) The storyline. I really loved the story and the plot devices. The drama sequences were REALLY good.4) The truth. This movie was pretty much dead-on to Ken Carter's real life experience. I watched the bonus feature ""Coach Carter: The Man Behind The Movie"" and it compared the movie to real life. It was like a perfect match.My favorite lines were at the end spoken by Samuel L. Jackson after the final game. I always watch that every night. It's become kind of like a tradition for me.

132,dan-kench,Coach Carter is superb,8,19 May 2011,"What can I say, this film is brilliant, it isn't perfect but it's really good. Samuel L Jackson does a great job as Coach Carter, very strict and emotive coach, you can tell how he's feeling when training his team and how the team is feeling having to deal with his rules. You have that typical basketball cliché when the rival team is winning by only a few points, but they manage to win within the last couple seconds, then you expect that to be the end of the film. But no, it doesn't end there, you see the team gasp in there glory, but face problems with there education. But the end is very interesting, you'd imagine the basketball cliché would happen once again, but there's a big twist to it and they lose to the best team in the state. But finishes with an important message, There are times we would win, and times when we lose, we can't win all the time, but when we lose, we keep our heads held high and let nothing stop us.",Coach Carter

That, however does not excuse it from being another endless remake-of-a remake originally made back in 1962 or whenever. I've seen this same story too many damn times as ""Hoosiers"", or pick whatever sport you wish vehicle. I only saw it because my cinematically-unadventurous friend got it from Netflix without any research other than the minimal blurb provided by them. What a waste of a Netflix subscription! Originality and creativity have not been hallmarks of Hollywood studio films for a long time. It's become common knowledge that films made and distributed by them are made primarily for adolescents and ""Asian mouth-breathers"".

139,Starman-26,Even if you don't like basketball...,10,17 January 2005,"you'll love this movie! It is a classic old school battle between students (players) and teacher (in this case coach), but it really hits home on some of the major obstacles facing our youth today. It is a wonderful film that offers an array of solutions, extreme as they may be.Early on the film begins with coach Carter slamming one of his belligerent new players into the gym wall only to hear the player whine ""teachers aren't supposed to touch students."" The rest of the film proves how teachers and coaches can touch students in other than physical ways to effect positive growth and change.Ever wanted to know what goes on at the high school dance? This movie holds no punches in showing what is hot and what is not when it comes to todays dances and parties. This might jar some memories! In the end, this film is a lot more than the typical ""you can succeed when things are really tough"" film. In fact, the ending is not exactly what I anticipated. Although the film is built around some very good basketball action, the center focus is on the growing up process, accountability, parent involvement, and the idea that ones actions really do have consequences that effect not only themselves, but those they hold dear.

140,gwnsystems,"A passable underdog story, but not much else.",6,21 April 2018,"This was on my watch later for almost a year, before I was looking for a sports movie after finishing a sports reality series, I figured why not.Samuel L. Jackson is Ken Carter, the owner of a successful sporting goods store and a former college basketball player. He is approached by his former high school coach to take the coaching job at inner-city Richmond H.S., where Carter was a 2 time All-American nearly 20 years prior. The team won just 4 games the previous season, but he decides to take on the job regardless, mostly as a favour. A mostly predictable sports underdog story ensues. The team is run ragged in practice, sign contracts relating to academics and soon enough, the team is on a lengthy undefeated streak. Numerous side plots include Carter's son transferring to Richmond to play for him, a player and girlfriend deciding what to do about a potential baby and a player leaving the team multiple times to sell drugs.Unexpectedly, Samuel L. Jackson is fantastic and in the end, the only thing keeping this from being rated a fair bit lower. A young Channing Tatum is literally just another player and not particularly memorable and besides Ashanti as a player's girlfriend, I couldn't tell you one other person casted in this movie. The inevitable middle of the movie conflict erupts, the baby angle is abruptly and clumsily ended and the drug dealing player's supplier is the only person shot to death in two hours. On the whole, Samuel L. Jackson is fantastic in this movie, more or less playing himself as a basketball coach. But, the whole script is not great, there's no real supporting performances that lead to a good scene and I thought the film ran way too long.

I like how finally there's a movie that upholds education over all else. Hollywood has problems with that too, sometimes.

And we all use to think that our coach ran us a lot, and we saw how much they ran and we don't even run half as much as they did! I loved this movie so much that I went and saw it in theaters 2 times then went out and bought the DVD and have always watched whenever I have noting to do or just feel like watching it. I think I have watched it about 11 times or so and it has helped me every time that I watch. I also find something new about. I also watched the behind the real Ken Carter and I know it is based on a true story but in real life they really did say those mean things to him. I also heard what the real athletes had to say and what they thought of him. In real life Coach Carter really did have 3 kids walk out on him and they said when he wanted to win to call him and he said he will but he never did call them. The real life athletes said that everything in that movie they really did feel until they got to know him. And now he is their idol and the man they look up to. Oh yea, there is one more thing that I saw about this movie that I couldn't believe. The schools got so bad and the government didn't want to support athletics so they now have no athletic teams in Richmond High or anywhere in Richmond because he government didn't want to pay for it.

I admired the fantastic job Coach Carter did with the basketball team, not only on the courts but in the classroom, and how he kept the kids off the streets and gave them a positive direction in their lives. Also, his discipline seemed a bit harsh at times, but his heart was in the right place and his methods worked. His dedication, responsibility, and optimistic attitude were a tremendous example for his student players. Coach Carter's job must have been hard and often frustrating but he didn't give up until he had given his students tools to have better lives than their parents, other relatives, and friends had had.

The movie really drives home the point that as a country our priorities are totally screwed up. The scene where Ken Carter asks the team who won last year's state tournament, and not one player could answer it proves the true value of sports in our society.

155,m-94955,Coach Carter Review,9,22 January 2020,"The movie I reviewed was Coach Carter, starring Samuel L. Jackson and Channing Tatum; it was directed by Thomas Carter. I consider this movie a success because it captures the idea of what many schools face who's students come from struggling homes and poverty, with low graduation rates, and high incarnation rates. This movie also shows the power of standing for what you believe In.
The movie follows an intercity basketball team that struggles to win games. Until Coach Carter takes over and transforms the team into a winning team using strict discipline; However, to play on Coach Carter's team, the players are required to maintain a certain grade point average and attend class. During the midst of a perfect season, Coach Carter finds out that the team fails to meet his requirements. He shuts down the gym and puts a hold on their perfect season until their grades improve. Against the judgment of parents and the school board, Coach Carter maintains his idea that academics come before sports.
Coach Carter is more than just a movie about basketball. It covers the fact in which many people deal with today - school systems with low graduation rates and high rates of incarnation. Coach Carter views the players as students before athletes, and instils the power of an education. This is seen in the movie where Coach Carter is explaining to the players, and the school board about the power of education. Well let me tell you what I see, I see a system that is designed for you to fail...growing up here in Richmond you're 80% more likely to go to prison than college"" (Samuel L Jackson). Coach Carter is going against the anti-intellectual message that for African Americans to be successful, it won't be because of education.
Another reason I consider this movie a success because it shows the power of self perseverance. Coach Carter, know the full extent of the dangers that these young men face, as he once was one of them. Before coaching, he attended high school at Richmond being one of the most successful basketball players ever to attend there. He watched his former teammates get arrested, and some of them being killed. This is seen in the movie where he goes against the entire Richmond community to shut down the gym. The parents believe Coach Carter is betraying the boys because they view this season as the best years of their life ""I came to coach basketball players. And you became students. I came to teach boys and you became men"" (Samuel L. Jackson). Coach Carter is stating that for these young men to be successful, they must overcome the misconception that the only way to prosperity is not through education. Coach Carter resistance from every angle, and even putting his job on the line. He ultimately wins over the boys, and they begin to help each other improve their academics.
Coach Carter is a very successful movie because it goes much deeper than just a typical basketball movie; it shows a reality that many young men and women are facing. It also shows the importance of self-perseverance, and this is why this movie is a success.",Coach Carter

159,uzi016,very good movie,10,29 September 2006,This movie is about basketball but also you can learn a lot of things from this movie.The way Carter (Samuel L. Jackson) is trying to keep them in line with the stuff they have to do in school and after school he cares a lot about them and teaches them that if they want to play basketball they should be able to keep up with other stuff two.From this movie you can learn a lot of stuff and i think that's the whole point of to movie.What i don't like about the movie its that the teachers don't really care what Carter is trying to do for those kids and that his trying to teach them how life is out there.,Coach Carter
160,sophjunior,Coach Carter Class Film,10,14 August 2006,"I believe Coach Carter is really good film, because it's not just another American sports film. Its another American sports film with real life issues. Issues which people think, its a movie if i act like that, nothing will happen to me like that. It wakes people up to what really can happen in your future life, what can happen when drugs and guns get involved in stuff. It shows how having sex and boozing and school are three things that are most important in life. Most important because if you take sex for granted one day things will process to a baby being produced the film shows how to high schoolers have issues when it comes to her being pregnant, boozing because you could say the wrong thing and end up in a ditch after being brutualised or anything, and school because without the high about of s.a.t. scores, the film shows what you could end up doing, selling drugs or being in jail. This film i believe it great so showing a really good sport but also the issues people by age 16+ also 16- have to think about, these days.",Coach Carter
161,cockerspanielsus,A Must See Movie,10,16 October 2006,I enjoyed this movie so much I rented it 3 times and decided to go ahead and buy it. I am glad Coach Carter did not let those do-nothings discourage him from molding those young men's lives to have futures and care not only about themselves but about others as well. I wish the school systems in America had more teachers and coaches like Coach Carter that not only demanded respect but gave it as well. My kids say I like the movie so much because I was a lot like him while I was schooling them. As I have said to them many times...life is full of a lot of adversity and very little coddling so you better know how to handle life from all aspects. You go Coach Carter!!!!!!,Coach Carter
162,lulutadic,Best Basketball Film Ever !!,10,4 June 2021,"It's definitely one of the best movies ever. I can watch it ten times a day. It's wonderful, it's inspiring and it's cool.

164,hubbylikesmovies,average at best,5,14 October 2007,"This movie was waaaaaayyyyy too long. It was entertaining but I got to the point where I was wondering ""when is this movie going to be over?"" I think it could have been cut to 1 hour and 45 minutes without losing any of its appeal. The lockout could have been shorter and when some creative filming it could have still had impact on the audience. And I was unimpressed with the storyline involving Kenyon and his girlfriend. It wasn't integrated into the heart of the movie very well and it always felt like we were cutting over to a soap opera. I was also disappointed with Samuel L. Jackson's acting. I've seen him do better. It felt like he was just going through the motions.",Coach Carter
165,ziyan-sheng-93,Definitely a movie to remember for the rest of your lives,9,28 March 2009,"When i first saw the movie on IMDb, it was rated only 7.1 so i thought it was just the average film. i watched it and i thought to myself, this is extremely under rated. it was probably the most inspirational movie i have ever seen.Everything that came out of coach carter's mouth was an inspiration and it was very true. what he said, is something everybody should remember and also apply it to their everyday lives. the bottom line is that it is a fantastic movie and if you ever get a chance to see it, you'll not be disappointed.In my view more films like this should be made with guidance to life, the reality to life and the choices you make and the consequences. Films with morals teach incredible things, therefore this movie definitely goes in my top 3.",Coach Carter
166,katelynpcarter,The Hero,8,13 July 2009,"Have you ever considered watching a dramatic film and thought it would be similar to any other dramatic movie, so why bother watching it? That was my first thought. Coach Carter, directed by Thomas Carter, seemed as if it simply was about a boys' high school basketball team and boys dealing with difficult lives. However, with the help of Mr. Carter, the new basketball coach, the boys' lives are about to change. In the poor town of Richmond, California, the high school boys' basketball team is in need of a new basketball coach. Knowing the displeasing reputation of these young men, Mr. Carter knows he can handle the job as the new coach. Mr. Carter sets strict rules for the team, teaching the boys the definition of respect. With a previous season of losses, Mr. Carter improves the team's performance on the court and begins an undefeatable season. However, the team's performance in class is unsatisfactory. With many failing grades, Mr. Carter takes action by taking basketball away. Mr. Carter deals with much criticism, but explains that education is more important and that basketball is only a privilege. Not only was it exciting to witness action on the basketball court, but also exciting to witness the action Mr. Carter took to help better the boys' lives. Living in ""ghetto"" neighborhoods, these boys were not prepared for the lives ahead of them. However, Mr. Carter knew he could make a difference and help push them to achieve their goals. Overall, this film sends the message that anyone, given the background or socioeconomic status, can be successful if they have determination and a willingness to succeed. Several years ago, I watched Coach Carter for the first time, and from then on, it has been a favorite of mine. Being based on a true story made it an unbelievably inspirational film because the viewer truly understands what Mr. Carter went through. With Samuel L. Jackson as Mr. Carter, I believe he truly made this film meaningful. I would definitely recommend watching Coach Carter.",Coach Carter

168,topcats2009,Coach Carter is the best movie I've seen in a long time!!!!,10,29 January 2005,Coach Carter is a really good movie and I don't understand how some people don't like it. It deals with real problems the African-Americans have (their grades are one of them.) This movie shows younger people that they should go to school and get an education. I was really moved by the movie. I don't understand why people call it unoriginal. Not all movies have to be original. The fact that it may not be original is alright because it deals with some problems the African-Americans that need to be told in more than just one movie. It was a good movie that made you want to cheer the team on to get their grades up and win the championship. I really recommend all of you to watch it!!!,Coach Carter
169,da_chachas,Not your typical sports film,8,19 February 2013,"In deciding to watch this movie, I am not going to lie, I expected to be watching another predictable inspirational sports movie. I expected to see the typical predictable underdog movie where a bunch of misfits end up coming out on top and afterward feel like I just wasted over two hours of my life. I could not have been more wrong. Coach Carter was more than just an inspirational movie; it had many deeper meanings within it and definitely has the potential to leave the viewer with a renewed sense of gratitude towards their life and their opportunities. The storyline was very marketable and fundamental. This movie was based on a true story where a California high school basketball coach named Ken Carter put a lock on his gym until all his students met the necessary academic requirements needed to have a chance to go for a secondary education. As simple as this storyline sounds, director Thomas Carter did a fair job at keeping the audience intrigued with multiple conflicts and preventing them from being able to predict what would happen. The script was satisfactory for the most part. Samuel L. Jackson did an excellent job in relaying his funny and strict retorts to his disrespectful players, and overall the script allowed him to stay in character the whole entire movie. The side plots throughout were very intriguing considering it was based off of a true story. The script did a decent job of portraying these stories without straying too far off of what actually happened in real life.The acting in this movie was sub-par at best. Samuel L. Jackson did a fantastic job as the lead role of Ken Carter, however he definitely stole the show and beyond that the acting was a bit too theatrical for my taste. It was noticeable that the supporting actors seemed disinterested when it was not their turn to act, and many conversations did not seem realistic or fluent. While the acting was not particularly impressive, the production value in this film was excellent. In most sports films today, it seems that the action scenes are unrealistic and the viewer can typically realize that it is not what true basketball actually feels like. Besides some exaggerated, animated calls from the referees, and childish reactions from the fans and bench players, they did an outstanding job of portraying what an actual high school basketball game atmosphere would be like. Most of the scenes in the entire movie had great production value and always had a very realistic feel to it. Director Thomas Carter did an excellent job with the story he was given. There was no scene in the entire movie that I felt was unnecessary and there were no noticeable blunders within the film. He kept it very professional and the mood of the film transitioned phenomenally as the players began to mature under their new coach. Lastly, although there are hundreds of inspirational movies on the market, this movie excels in originality. This film is not the typical underdog movie, however it teaches morals and life lessons to all the viewers. Ken Carter's players never lacked talent, but lacked the discipline and academic strength in order to succeed in not only basketball, but also life itself. By way of harsh punishments and requirements, he gets his players on the right track to being successful. It is definitely a unique film and overall, it is an outstanding film to watch.",Coach Carter
170,thejiggaman,Excellent from beginning to end,10,17 January 2005,"Coach Carter is not your usual high-school sports flick. It is about the fundamentals of life that we sometimes forget. Don't be fooled by other critics saying that this is your typical sports flick where the team wins in the end. They have missed the point of Coach Carter. The movie isn't about the team winning; it's about the lives of kids who were predestined to fail and in turn succeeded. Coach Carter allows the audience to examine the lives of these kids and keeps it real. The direction of this movie allows you to be there rather than just watching it. Character Development, Plot, Soundtrack, Editing Transitions all 10s in my book. This is one movie you'll want in your collection. Enough Said. Go Watch It!",Coach Carter
171,hickoryhilliard,Carter (Jackson) Overcame Low Expectations in Well Delivered US Urban Story,10,29 January 2005,"This wonderfully told story and the characters in it literally reflect America--its diverse mosaic of ethnic/racial/socioeconomic groups and their corresponding and sometimes disappointing expressed and implied expectations.Coach Carter came from Richmond, California, a once predominantly white town now overwhelmingly populated by blacks and Latinos. All hope or expectation at Richmond High of graduating citizens one by one that could contribute to their communities seemed to have left with the white flight, but Coach Carter was willing to challenge that implied assumption.Carter was a solid civic pillar of the community long before taking over as head coach of Richmond High. He quietly ran his successful business and chose to raise his family in the community. When he took those young men to victory on the basketball court it eventually became apparent to him other problems would derail their success at life. He realized he had no control over a lot of what went on, but he took a stand on the things he could and greatness was the result. If you haven't seen the movie, go. The way Samuel Jackson and the movie full of future stars delivered, will leave you barreling over with laughter one moment and your vision blurred with tears the next.Bravo Coach Carter.",Coach Carter
172,rawbert_12,Inspirational,10,12 February 2013,"Coach Carter was a brilliant film to me. The actors, the soundtrack, and the plot were all amazing in my eyes. First off, when you are making a film i take it that you need a leader and there are not much great leaders like Samuel L. Jackson. He was assigned the job of being a basketball coach and he used this privilege to not only teach them the right way to play basketball, but also the way to live life by reaching for your goals. He put his foot down in an area no one would attempt to and I commend him for it. Next, we have the soundtrack. This movie takes place in a town filled with gangs, drugs, and poverty. ""DMX"" is a rapper and he was on this soundtrack. His song ""Untouchable"" featured in Coach Carter and it fit in perfectly considering these players were trying to live about the influence and do something good with their lives. Finally, to say the plot was good would be an understatement. I say this due to the fact that the plot was difficult to guess. You never knew what was going to happen next and that kept it interesting. Overall this movie made me realize how hard some people have it and not to take anything for granted. It also taught me that its not always what you put into something, but what you learn from it.",Coach Carter
173,romero_en,Samuel L. Jackson never disappoints,10,31 October 2005,"Let me repeat that: Samuel L. Jackson never disappoints. That is exactly the kind of performance I expect. Of course, being directed by the individual you're portraying helps tremendously. No director/actor pair could work better. I typically don't like sports movies because they are too predictable: the team always wins!! How predictable!! On this movie, however, the team actually loses! Imagine my surprise! But by that point I realized that that was not the point of the movie. It's now how you play the game, it's how hard you tried, what lessons your learned. It's just like boot camp getting ready to go to war. Except there are no lethal weapons involved. Just a ball!",Coach Carter
174,MrMeth,Satisfied,7,10 June 2005,"I went into this expecting a typical sports drama. A group of troubled kids are driven crazy by the new high school coach, initially they resist but grow to the occasion and turn from underdogs into winners. With my expectations in mind, I have to say I'm totally satisfied. The movie delivers the drama, the storyline pretty well, we all feel for the characters. Most importantly it delivers a message, a few actually: education is a number one priority in every society, lead by example, rise above the odds, never give up and so on. It is predictable though and full of cliché situations. But that didn't ruin the feel you get after watching this movie for me. I definitely recommend it to anyone without high expectations, and seeking for a good sports movie.",Coach Carter

I loved this movie so much, and I can't wait until I see it again! I even cried in some parts, like when Cruz's...wait I can't tell you guys anything!! That will ruin it! I Loved this movie, I can't say it enough! Please, Please, if you're a smart person, and I know that you are, you will go out and watch this movie!!!!

176,dulce_m_cardenas,good! excellent!,10,17 January 2005,"This movie is not just your average movie. It sends out a very powerful message to everyone out there. It particularly applies to the growing minorities. The message was to look at the quality of life and standard of living that our parents have and to ask ourselves if that is the kind of life that we want for ourselves or do we want to do better in life. This movie goes way beyond the scenes of high school life and it has to do with not being inferior and having desire to persevere in life. The question is do we want to be average or do we want better for ourselves. Going to college will not only enhance our chances of being better educated, but it will also enable us to have the ability of having a higher standard of living. Without an education, there is very little that we can accomplish in life and we are nothing without it.",Coach Carter

(with new gooey center!)",1,25 July 2005,"Coach Carter may be afraid of what could happen to his students if they don't get a good education, but he certainly isn't afraid of fully embracing every inspirational-sports-movie- cliché in the book. Through a series of grueling montages and broad character strokes, Carter and his team overcome all obstacles. The script presents Carter as an all-knowing- oracle, who is never wrong and never doubts himself. In one sequence where the kids sneak off to a late night party, we feel more for them and their desire to have fun then we do Carter, though the movie puts us squarely on his side. He never doubts himself, never has feelings or thoughts besides external ones, never seems to think he may be doing something wrong.",Coach Carter

It made me cheer for Samuel Jackson (Coach Carter) as he worked to instill discipline and order to the Richmond team. He put education first and athletics second. The character development was excellent, and the idea of honoring your commitments was underscored throughout the movie. If you want to see a movie the motivates you, and makes you want to challenge the status quo...then go see this one. It isn't a teen movie with clichéd characters. It was real world. I'd put it on my top ten list for the year. And it isn't a sports movie, although sports are key throughout. It deals with making men out of boys, and students out of athletes.",Coach Carter

The movie was seriously so good. It had everything a good movie should. The basketball scenes were so real from the beginning to end that the audience clapped and cheered for good plays as if they were actually at the game. I've seen several basketball movies and i've never been moved to the point that i could appreciate the movie more than basketball content, except maybe love and basketball or finding forrester. this movie has to be seen it was really touching, a great story.

180,beethoven76,Coach Carter kicks some butt,7,22 January 2005,"The film Coach Carter is based on the real life events of Coach Ken Carter in Richmond, CA. Carter takes over a struggling high school basketball program and uses strict, authoritarian methods to instill discipline on the team and (hopefully) produce a winning season. The team members rebel at first, but most of them soon go along with his request to sign a contract that involves getting good grades and not getting into trouble.The basketball starts winning big time and the whole town is excited about the new attitude and confidence they see in the players. But most of the players are doing a lot of bad stuff anyway, and are floundering in their school work. Carter decides to put the season on hold and risk missing the state high school basketball playoffs until the team shapes up. Everyone is up in arms and the the big question is, will they get rid of the too-strict coach, or make the kids go along with their original agreement.Samuel L. Jackson is the lead actor portraying Coach Carter, and he does a great job. I thought he was believable in the role since he projects a disciplinarian-type authority. Although his character is somewhat ""infallible"", Jackson plays it about right.The other characters all play their parts well, but they're pretty one-dimensional. I thought that Robert Ri'chard actually underplayed his part as Carters son, Damien, He was a little too low key.The cinematography captured the gritty reality of urban Richmond and also was good at showing the tough, physical reality of basketball.On the downside, there was quite a bit of profanity which may turn off some viewers, especially those who have younger children. And the characters could have used some more depth. But overall I think that Coach Carter is a god sports-themed movie and I enjoyed it.",Coach Carter

I was grounded the week it came out and so I had to ask my dad if he wanted to go see it as a bonding thing. (Which was asking a lot considering the fact that he is kind of racist.) But anyways HE actually liked it and said he wants to add it to his DVD collection when it comes out. I was pretty surprised considering the fact of how much flack I get for being into the so called ""black culture"". The movie is both funny and sad at the same time. Many things happen that you wouldn't think would happen or really aren't expected. This is a very dramatic movie and I would definitely recommend it to anyone. SO GO SEE IT!! (Also the soundtrack is pretty good.) I'm going to see it again this Saturday but I don't know if i can wait that long.

182,cjbarnette,Coach Carter is so good!!!!,9,21 January 2005,"Samuel Jackson pulls off another incredible performance as the basketball coach of the Richmond HS team. Wonderful story of a man who stands for principles unlike many of the coaches of this day. Who choose to either win at all cost, and promote themselves as the one and only guru of basketball. The ladies game shows that pure basketball is pass, catch, shoot, defend. Not dunks all the time. And its great. Coach Carter shows that there is even more, educating and teaching his players as they pursue W's on the court. It can be done and this movie shows gives blueprint. Cruz's quotes in the gym scene near the end speak profound words of wisdom. ""Our deepest fear is not that we are inadequate, our deepest fear is that we are powerful beyond measure. It is our light, not our darkness, that most frightens us; yet playing small does not serve the world. There is nothing enlightened about shrinking, so that other people want feel insecure around you. We are all meant to shine as children do. Its not just in some of us, its in everyone, and as we let our own light shine, we unconsciously give other people permission to do the same. As we are liberated from our own fear, our presence automaticlly liberates others."" That blew me away. So much so that I had to see the movie twice to get all that. Go see this one. Its a wonderful movie with all types of lessons for the young and the old. And the cast is beautiful. Ashanti whoa! I'll have this one for the library when it comes out----the first day!

183,forevertherealest,A look into a great story,10,24 January 2005,"I thought this movie was amazing. This movie represents a lot more than just another typical basketball movie and reveals a majority of the true story of Coach Ken Carter. His story is so uplifting in its content and how it came to be a formality that I could guarantee anyone would at least smile after seeing this movie. It makes you think about where our priorities lie, both as individuals and as a society.Having met Ken Carter after seeing this movie, it only solidifies that this man is the real deal. His love, compassion, and respect for everyone is refreshing in today's world. In meeting this man, I realize that we should all be so fortunate as to have a mentor like him. And I'd be wrong if I didn't add he's a lot funnier in real life than Mr. Jackson portrays in the movie (and rightfully so, with consideration to the story). I also have to assure you that Samuel L. Jackson is the PERFECT FIT for Ken Carter's role. Not only is there a resemblance in looks, but the voice similarity was downright eerie at times during his speech.Anyways... good movie, great story, amazing man. Enjoy!",Coach Carter
184,ghetto_lady_t,The Best Basketball Movie,9,27 January 2005,"Yo this movie was hot. I really liked it a lot. The only thing I didn't like was that at the end they lost the championship, but it was OK because they did good. I enjoyed this movie a lot because one of my favorite r&b artists was in that movie which was Ashanti. I love her songs. I also liked it because Rob Brown (Kenyon Stone) reminds me so much of a guy I like. He is so cute. This movie was really good because it shows you how some people care about you and how it's good for you to stay in school and not be outside selling drugs just how Rick Gonzalez (Timo Cruz) did in the movie. At least he realized that it was bad when his cousin got shot right in front of him.It also shows how a highschool student was pregnant which was Ashanti (Kira) and how she aborts it because she doesn't think her and Kenyon aren't ready to have the baby. Now I'm going to stop so that I won't give the whole movie out. Like I said before this is a really good movie especially for those who love basketball because I'm a big fan of basketball and I really enjoyed this movie. This was the best basketball movie I ever seen!!!!!",Coach Carter
185,thebigeasy_619,A brilliant movie all round,10,28 February 2005,"In fact ""brilliant"" is too small a word to conclude this movie, it was way beyond my expectations. Based on true story, this inspirational picture is about a basketball coach Ken Carter (played by Samuel L. Jackson), who coached a bunch of ""society forgotten"" teenagers and how his unorthodox methods inspired them not only to become good ball players, but also to learn to be disciplined, to get a good education, and most important of all: To get a decent living.And Samuel L. Jackson? How much cooler can this guy be? And are there any roles that he cannot be perfected in? He is undoubtedly the most underrated actor of our era. I have been his fan for God knows how long, and his performance in this picture really makes me hold him in a higher regard. Only he could success this role and I just wish that he will get some major awards for this act cos he totally deserves it.I think this movie totally reflected the leak hole of America's educational sports system. Sports become so big in America that when an opportunity to play sports and earn big money arises, people would become narrow-minded and grab the opportunity without second thought. They forget that sports don't make a boy a man, education does. It's all good and well that a man has a sporting talent, he can work on that and become rich and famous. However people can take away your sporting career, but they can't do so with what you have learnt, in this case education can work as a contingency, something you can fall back on.

It is giving future and hope for the future and for the hopeful!!! It is giving life and meaning for all weak. I am not against any high players in the NBA and i love them especially KG but i think this movie showed that one person can really affect a community it is just up now for the community to accept the changes he or she gonna make... And i hope that there would be more Coach Carters' in the world so the world can be a better place to live... Ya Heard!!! Rich...What? RICHMOND!!! Holla!!!",Coach Carter

189,snowbunny376,This movie was great!,10,11 June 2005,"I loved this movie! I thought it was the greatest movie of the year and one of the best I have ever seen. It had a great plot and the actors/actresses where fantastic. I love movies that at one minute I am laughing and the next minute I am crying. At the end when she had the abortion I was crying. I felt so bad for them. That was a huge decision for her to make on her own. I could watch that movie 24-7 and it would never get tiring. It was such a great movie!! The soundtrack is also really good. I just love ""Hope"" by Twista and Faith Evans. After I saw that movie that was is still is one of my favorite song. The music video is also great. I love that too. I love the fact that it is a true story. I think that because it is a true story really made an impact on me. It really showed how important school is and how you need to work very hard on what you want in life.",Coach Carter
190,cav_ph31221,Coach Carter,7,11 June 2005,"* John Wooden wanted his players to be both 'morally and mentally conditioned' on and off the court, and this film had this as a prominent theme - especially with the Cruz rendition of Nelson Mandelas 1994 inaugural speech (""...our deepest fear is that we are powerful beyond measure..."") I believe many teachers/coaches would experience, and have to adapt to the same emotions, especially if they work in the sort of context depicted. * The use of running and push-ups as a disciplinary measure is something that many coaches disagree with - whether the film endorses their use will provide some indication of the combined influence of sport and the media. * The abortion of Kyra's baby was treated too lightly. * The film produced several thoughts & feelings, mainly good, and the 2+ hours didn't seem to drag (ie., it was quite engaging).",Coach Carter
191,arreganhaquelavaitripa,Study for playing Basketball!!,10,14 June 2005,"One of the most beautiful story's that i ever heard. As a basketball player i say: a dream come thru for those guys - As a spectator i say: these basketball players was safe by a man with heart. School is a necessary and basketball is a gift by god...and coach Kenn Carter knew that since the first minute that he accept that contract... Resume: The story's about a basketball team who can't win games on university championship. Until Sir. Carter takes the team high with a hard team work. In the middle of movie happens a lot of different things. The movie finish with a great lesson of life. A masterpiece with a great argument and a great direction.A TRUE STORY, you need to see it!!!",Coach Carter
192,crity2re,It's about time there's a movie about morals.,10,29 June 2005,"Honestly, I don't care about dates. I don't care about names, or stats, or if the writers got a bunch of stats confused. I mean did you actually watch the movie, or were you just looking at the screen for misprints on jerseys? To believe that some people can actually watch a movie and then complain that the time line is off with reality is beyond my comprehension. Who cares about the time line! It's not reality that you're watching, it's a movie. Movies, no matter how real the stories they are based on, are not real. They are altered. They are changed to make a better storyline.If people can be dense enough to complain about names and numbers and dates, then they missed the big picture. They missed a great movie that actually conveys a real message. It's not about the sports, it's about the students. And it's not always about what you put in, it's about what you take out. It's about what you take away from the situation that you've walked into.That's what this movie is about, not about basketball. It's about life, and how easily people give in and give up. It's about learning, and having faith that people will do the right thing. Yes, it's about public education, and a community on the edge of stupid, but there's more to it than that. You just have to stop looking, and watch.This movie truly was excellent, right up there on the shelf next to ""With Honors."" But make sure you are really paying attention, otherwise, what's the point?",Coach Carter
193,JThomas715,Real,8,6 July 2005,"I'll try not to spoil too much.Plot: Based on the true story of Coach Carter, who takes a job at his alma mater Richwood High at the request, no at the begging, of the team's current coach. He takes the job after the season has started, so he doesn't have much time to shape the team up. He gets to work putting the kids into shape physically, and then begins the challenge of getting them in shape academically. The conflict in the story comes from the latter challenge. He attempts to get the school to cooperate with him, but to little avail. He goes through numerous methods and channels trying to accomplish his ultimate goal (besides winning state), preparing his athletes for college. In the end...well if you haven't seen it, I'll let you find out for yourself.Cast: Samuel L. Jackson is great, what else can be said? He can play such a wide range of roles, and yet he is totally believable in all of them. I never once thought ""Shaft"" or ""Changing Lanes"" or even ""Star Wars"" during his performance as a basketball coach. He played the part very well, without being phony. The young stars did quite well in their roles, and it was a credit to the writing and directing crew as well that they gave background to every character, so that the athletes didn't seem like ""rebels without a cause"", the weakest character was Kiera (played by Alliyah), but still wasn't bad, just didn't shine...and the film went on despite it.Review: I loved this movie, this past year was my senior year, and my school basketball team went through a similar story of nobody thinking anything of us, and we showing up and winning our district and entering the playoffs (so the same plot, minus the ghetto and disrespect for the coach). Point is, I felt the pain of the players through their losses, and I felt the rush of winning as this film reminded me of my team and how we fared.Basketball fans and players alike will not be disappointed.8/10",Coach Carter
194,dwinkert,Coach Carter is unique,9,30 September 2015,"Coach Carter is one of most notable sports films to ever be released. When Coach Ken Carter of the Richmond High School basketball team accepts his new job to coach and mentor a group of reckless and bashful individuals, he has no idea what the future holds. The emotional aspect of this movie leaves student athletes on the edge of their seats. Even if one is not a student athlete, it leaves a message that can have a true impact on their life and future. The true story of Coach Carter is easily a must-see movie because of its eventful plot, exciting climax, and the connection it makes to its targeted audience.Coach Ken Carter decides to return to his high school in Richmond, California to take up a head coaching position for the Richmond Oilers. He knows that this isn't the easiest task for anyone as the dysfunctional and rough bunch of players only went on to win four games total in the previous season. Even with these setbacks, Carter believes that with his discipline he can enforce on his new team both on the court and in the classroom, they can be one of the best teams in the area. In many ways, Coach Carter is portrayed as an overall inspirational and at times heart-felt movie. The first thing that comes to mind when discussing this film, is the work done by main actors like Samuel L. Jackson, Rick Gonzalez, Rob Brown, Channing Tatum, and others apart of the Richmond High School basketball team. There are many excellent things to note when regarding this. As the head coaching role, Ken Carter (Jackson), encounters many situations where his role needs to be very strict with a serious attitude towards his players. Jackson does a fantastic job doing this and making it very believable and life-like to the audience. Another actor who does a great work in the acting aspect is Rick Gonzalez. Gonzalez plays the role as Timo Cruz, one of the stubborn players of the ball team. Cruz's character has an important role played throughout the film that causes him to go from the ignorant and bashful basketball player, to one of the key players the team needs both on and off of the basketball court. He goes through challenges that requires heavy emotion which is exactly what Rick Gonzalez brings to the table when he portrays his role. The impact that these actors have on the outcome of the movie helps the main message and purpose be given to the audience.The main message is meant to be inspirational and emotional to any audience watching this movie. The director, Thomas Carter, purposefully tries to get the audience involved by leaving them in question and guessing what exactly will happen next. This emotional aspect is what leads the movie to build a personal connection to its viewers. A prime example of this comes when Coach Carter takes action when the players' grades start to slip. He tries time and time again to get the understanding in their heads that students become before athletes when considering ""student athletes."" At first, this doesn't go over well with the players, but in time it goes to show how powerful a person can be with school work, basketball, and other areas or difficulties in life.The work done by the actors, the director, and the writers have led to this movie being one of the biggest successes in sports films of this era. If you haven't ever experienced this movie, I suggest that you get on it and watch it. I guarantee you will not be disappointed with the work done by director Thomas Carter and by the actors. Coach Carter has had an impact on my personal life that sometimes cannot be put into words. If, however, it had to be put in words, it would be what Rick Gonzalez's character says near the peak of the movie; ""Our deepest fear is not that we are inadequate, but that we are powerful beyond measure.""",Coach Carter
195,jontheroadrunner,excellent,10,15 July 2005,"Excellent! I loved this movie..one of the best in a long time!!!The basketball action was excitingThe way the importance of education was stressed was very good.I enjoyed seeing the coach follow a vision for his players, and sticking to his principles...The way Cruz got a wake up call was cool too...It was nice to see something good happen, a happy ending, see something good happening in life...a true story too! Standout quote; The thing we are most afraid of is that we fail to realise our potential and be the best we can be...",Coach Carter
196,mmellenberger,Basketball and Heart: Coach Carter Has It All!,9,7 October 2015,"Richmond High School's basketball team is a joke. The players can't work together and hardly ever show up for school on a regular basis. Enter Ken Carter, the owner of a local sporting goods store, and alumni of Richmond. Ken is offered the basketball coaching job at his alma mater. Immediately upon accepting the offer, Coach Carter lays down the law and requires all of his players to sign a contract stating that they will attend every class and maintain at least a 2.3 GPA. After conditioning his team into shape, they go on to enjoy an undefeated season. However, the season is cut short after several members of the team fail their classes and Coach Carter locks up the gym and cancels all further practices and games. Coach Carter is not your average cliché tale of the underdog team beating the odds and going on to win the state championship. This film, based on a true story, tells of a basketball coach who makes it his mission to not only help the team win games, but also give them the opportunity to attend college by forcing them to focus on their grades as well. Besides just focusing on the aspect of basketball in the movie, it also shows us the individual struggles in the lives of the young men. These problems range from teen pregnancy to drug dealing and gang-related activity. These are very real problems in some societies today, and this helps make the movie more relatable. It is the ability to relate to some aspects of this movie that contributes to the overall emotion of the film. Coach Carter is an inspiring story about perseverance and it conveys the message that even what seems impossible can ultimately be achieved.Samuel L. Jackson portrays Coach Carter in the movie. As per usual when it comes to Jackson's performances, he maintains a serious tone and a steely resolve. This was a crucial element in Jackson's role as Coach Carter because he had to be a strict and disciplinary authority figure. There were also some of Jackson's lines in the film that were comical, which, while still being somewhat serious, he delivered perfectly. A job well done, Samuel L. Jackson.Furthermore, in my opinion, Rick Gonzalez delivered the most memorable performance in the film, other than Jackson's Coach Carter. Gonzalez's character, Timo Cruz, is a troubled kid mixed up in his cousin's gang activity. After initially quitting, he wants to return to the team and will do whatever it takes to get back on – including doing 2,500 push ups and 1,000 ""suicides"". Let's not forget his moving speech near the end of the film. Gonzalez played the role of Timo Cruz with plenty of emotion and attitude and it was incredible. Overall, this film has a great plot, great casting, and a great amount of emotion and character complexity. In the end, I would recommend Coach Carter to everyone. I am not always a huge fan of sports movies, but even if you feel like I do you should still check it out. It is a heart-warming, inspirational film with a great message.",Coach Carter
197,MichiganMan87,Enjoyable film!,8,13 January 2021,"8 out of 10Likable and enjoyable plot about a team and the coach , he carries out a hard challenge : Carter cancels all team activities and locks the court until the team shows acceptable academic improvement ; but both of them face the dual duel of bringing the players to the state championship and redeeming themselves . Splendid film from the filmmaker and writer John Gatins , of another David beats Goliath sports movie in which protagonists assume a difficult challenge . Sentimental plot stretches Hollywood manipulation , but is still entertaining .Samuel L . Jackson delivers an engaging acting as is backed by a good supporting cast such as Robert Ri'chard as his son Damien Carter , Debbi Morgan as his wife , Rick Gonzalez as Timo Cruz , Antwon Tanner as Worm , Vincent Laresca as Renny , Ashanti as Kyra, Texas Battle as Maddux and Channing Tatum who a bit later on would become a first world star ; in fact , Tatum had never played basketball before making the movie so he had to have individual training with the coaches to get up to speed with the other actors. Atmospheric and adequate musical score by Trevor Ravin , plenty of rap music . Fine production design and good sets , filmmakers had trouble filling the FieldHouse with extras for the final game, and needed to move people around when shooting different angles .",Coach Carter
198,gandhi_rules,awesome,10,19 July 2005,"this movie was incredible. It's similarity to lower class neighbour hood high school was absolutely stunning. And Samuel Jackson plays perfectly into the role of a tough high school coach, who is torn between love for his players and his strict rules, but he never fails. Even the players are portrayed realistically as teenagers from the hood,smoking partying and fighting but managing to stay great basketball players.Even has a twisted ending which is rare for a sports movie.This movie is the best sports movie since remember the titans(which i also own).

200,jehwv,Dedicated to more than just SPORTS - A real to life portrayal of inner city.,7,13 August 2005,"Samuel L. Jackson does a masterful job in portraying Coach Carter as do the other actors in their roles. This film should go a long way in helping correct our inner city problems especially if the real players watch the film. It should shock some reality into them. I was disappointed that Hollywood felt it had to add some tawdry sex scenes and use vulgarity and profanity to get their message across. I understand that these things are part of the real world but they don't need to go to the degree they do in making their point. For example I think Coach Carter's profaning the name of Diety took away from his character and the moral value the film was trying to teach. It should be just as important to show respect for Diety as it is to respect one's self, leaders, and own race. If Hollywood wanted us to see real-life portrayals of profanity it should have come from elsewhere in the movie not from Coach Carter. Otherwise, I would have rated this a 10.",Coach Carter
201,jk1969,the message,10,23 August 2005,"Although this move's premise and message are not original, it should be required viewing for any teenage boy (and girl) who thinks the path to success is through pro sports. This movie and ""Hoop Dreams"" would be enough.In short, this is a spot on movie, that has some language and teen situations which may make it too grown up for youngsters. Other than that, Samual Jackson continues a long tradition of commanding performances, which give the movie its backbone and structure.The struggle to find one's way is punctuated by the life choices that we all make and it is here that Coach Carter sounds a clear bell, that the better path is to engage your mind and give yourself MORE choices as you reach adulthood.Finding that your good on the basketball court and can win is a wonderful experience, but it does make for an easy or automatic path to success.A movie like this needs to be made every generation because the message is always worth spreading.My favorite line is when one of the boys answers Coach Carters question, ""what's you greatest fear?"" Our deepest fear is not that we are inadequate. Our deepest fear is that we are powerful beyond measure. It is our light, not our darkness that most frightens us. Your playing small does not serve the world. There is nothing enlightened about shrinking so that other people won't feel insecure around you. We are all meant to shine as children do. It's not just in some of us; it is in everyone. And as we let our own lights shine, we unconsciously give other people permission to do the same. As we are liberated from our own fear, our presence automatically liberates others.",Coach Carter

As a basketball coach myself I'd like to watch this with my team. I'm also a teacher and believe this movie has some great messages behind it. I know from my own time playing basketball, that this movie has inspired the game and training sessions across the world, probably. Nice work from the actors involved, top class performance. Some legends featured in there, Samuel L Jackson, Channing Tatum, among others. It's a roller coaster, it's real, emotional, celebratory and definitely one for the DVD collection.

This film worth watching over and over, the story line is very good and the acting is even better. Rick Gonzalez who plays a troubled young man by the name of Timo Cruz, Out-shines Samuel L.
