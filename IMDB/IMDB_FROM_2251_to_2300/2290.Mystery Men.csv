0,MartinHafer,An amazingly polarizing film--you'll either love it or hate it,8,3 September 2007,"The story is about the lamest group of super-heroes you could imagine. Apart from Janine Garafolo's ""Bowler"", the rest are amazingly untalented and unimpressive as they try to battle the dark forces of an evil super-villain, ""Cassanova Frankenstein"". The only one who COULD defeat the bad guy is ""Captain Fantastic"", who unfortunately was captured by Cassanova and the Mystery Men are forced into action.I loved the many quirky characters in the film. My favorite was the ""Blue Rajah"" (played by Hank Azaria). The fact that he dressed in green and tossed spoons (not even forks or knives) at the beginning of the film AND lived with his mother made him a hoot. But the rest were all quirky and silly--making the film a wonderful little comedy.Of all the films I have ever watched, this seems to be the one with the most polarized reactions to it (even more so than THE HUDSUCKER PROXY). When I first saw it, I loved it and couldn't wait to get others to see it. Surprisingly, again and again, those I watched it with hated it! And over the years, I have met many people who either loved it or hated it--not many in between.Unfortunately, I really can't say whether or not you will like the film. Those who I know that did were all weird people (like me) and it seemed that the more conventional people just thought the movie was stupid. So depending on which camp you'd place yourself should determine whether or not you give this a try.",Mystery Men
1,Leofwine_draca,Misfit superheroes in a lame comedy,4,13 October 2011,"I'm not sure why I watched this, as I hate a lot of comedies and I'm sure to avoid the kind of films that Ben Stiller makes in particular. But I do try and watch superhero films, and the synopsis of this one sounded interesting, to say the least: a group of would-be crime-fighters, with pathetic superpowers, attempt to beat an arch villain. There's a premise with potential, if nothing else.Sadly, what I ended up watching was a heavily sanitised Hollywood film with an oh-so predictable outcome: that by working together and putting faith in each other, this rag-tag group of misfits can end up winning the day. Literally every step of the film is signposted from the beginning, from Stiller's tired romance with an extraneous Claire Forlani to the bad guy's plans for world domination. Even worse, the humour sucks. One guy is flatulent, another guy thinks he's invisible when he's not, and the wit never goes any deeper than that.I realised, in the end, that I was watching a kid's film made on a totally undemanding level. It's a shame, because there are some fine actors appearing here, not least William H. Macy, Janeane Garofalo, Geoffrey Rush and Wes Studi, but in the end MYSTERY MEN is cheesy, dated and dull. It took another 11 years for a film to put some real bite into a superhero parody: watch KICK-ASS to see how this should have been done.",Mystery Men
2,SnoopyStyle,Spleen and Bowler funny,7,23 August 2015,"Mr. Furious (Ben Stiller), Blue Raja (Hank Azaria) and the Shoveler (William H. Macy) are rather incompetent superheroes of Champion City. They are rescued by the endorsement-obsessed Captain Amazing/tycoon Lance Hunt (Greg Kinnear). All the big villains are gone. When he loses an endorsement, Captain Amazing helps Casanova Frankenstein (Geoffrey Rush) get parole from the asylum in hopes of fighting him for the popularity. Tony P (Eddie Izzard) and the disco boys join Casanova and his psychiatrist Dr. Anabel Leek (Lena Olin) to reign terror in the city. Captain Amazing is captured by Casanova and Furious leads the group to try to rescue him. However the disco boys are too competent and the gang needs to recruit new superheroes. Invisible Boy (Kel Mitchell) can only be invisible when nobody is watching him. The Spleen (Paul Reubens) can fart at will rendering the target unconscious. The Bowler (Janeane Garofalo) has a bowling ball with her heroic father's possessed skull. The gang is rescued by the Spinx (Wes Studi) who can mentally cut guns in half. Doc Heller (Tom Waits) makes non-lethal weapons.There are two characters that are actually funny. The rest are deliberately quirky without being funny. Spleen is funny. Fart jokes will always work and Reubens is great at it. Garofalo is kinda funny at times. Her big contribution is that she makes others funnier especially Stiller. Furious is silly but not that funny until he starts arguing with Garofalo. The movie is too overloaded with characters. The concept is fun. When it hits, it's hilarious. Even when it misses, it's still kinda cute.",Mystery Men
3,kosmasp,It's not a mystery ... man (or woman or diverse),8,26 September 2021,"We're going with the time. I reckon the movie nowadays would not be called men ... but team. I mean there are not just men in the group so ... but before you go social warrior on the movie or me, be aware that the group contains a lot of people from different backgrounds. And while the main love story is a heterosexual one, that does not mean it knocks off or is unfair to anyone else. Having Eddie Izzard suggests quite the opposite, even if he is playing an evil character.That all aside, the movie works even nowadays. For some maybe even more so than back when it was released. A great group of actors comes together and they make a really funny movie. But apart from the A-cast as the director himself calls them, you have a lot of smaller roles that have really fun people cast ... one of the funnier ones is probably Michael Bay as Frat Boy (leader).Yes this makes fun of Superhero movies and you can like it even if you are a fan of said movies ... there is nothing that speaks against that, quite the opposite is true. One can enjoy both - a good superhero movie (or two or almost all of them) and still be quite fond of a spoof movie like this.Predictable but still fun ride, which is a testament to the actors and the overall funny script.",Mystery Men
4,classicsoncall,"""He who questions training, only trains himself at asking questions.""",7,29 October 2016,"I enjoy a good parody flick every now and then, and this would have been better if they kept the dopey juvenile stuff out of it. Paul Reubens in the cast with his gimmick was just asking for trouble; I was waiting for the zits on his face to move around like Marty Feldman's hump in ""Young Frankenstein"" and that didn't happen, so there was an opportunity missed. Hank Azaria as The Blue Raja and William H. Macy as the Shoveler were about the best the picture had to offer as they played their parts both ways, serious and funny.For old time TV and movie fans, let me pose a question - didn't the man under the Sphinx mask look like it might have been an aged Jay Silverheels? I know, he was long gone by the time this film came out, but that's the reaction I had. So I checked out Wes Studi's photo gallery here on IMDb and one can notice the resemblance.The thing that really surprised me in the story was how the evil Casanova Frankenstein (Geoffrey Rush) rigged up that vaporizer to reduce Captain Amazing (Greg Kinnear) to ashes, and he stayed dead! What!!?? That's not supposed to happen! Super-hero deaths are never supposed to be as certain as death and taxes, so I was shocked that no one thought of a way to reanimate his remains. Maybe in a sequel? Well, I don't know. I thought this would be a little better than it turned out to be, but I do appreciate some of the more clever gimmicks like Raja's silverware dexterity and the super-hero tryout routine. Seeing Louise Lasser as Raja's Mom once again was kind of neat too, doing a senior citizen rendition of Her Mary Hartman character. I guess if you're on the fence about watching this one, I'd have to say, 'What the fork, just do it'.",Mystery Men
5,lee_eisenberg,This may be the coolest superhero movie ever.,8,4 October 2005,"On one level, ""Mystery Men"" is kind of dumb. But on all other levels, it's a hoot. When superhero Captain Amazing (Greg Kinnear) is kidnapped by the lascivious Casanova Frankenstein (Geoffrey Rush), it's up to superhero wannabes Mr. Furious (Ben Stiller), The Shoveller (William H. Macy) and The Blue Rajah (Hank Azaria) to save him. Along the way, the group is joined by Invisible Boy (Kel Mitchell), Spleen (Paul Reubens), Baby Bowler (Janeane Garofalo) and The Sphinx (Wes Studi), all of whom provide some riotous lines.Among other things, this was the first place where I ever saw comedian Eddie Izzard (he plays Tony P., one of Frankenstein's henchmen). All in all, the movie is great fun. Don't get turned off just because the sets look a little bit like those from the god-awful ""Batman and Robin""; ""Mystery Men"" is really cool. It's one of a kind.",Mystery Men
6,jboothmillard,Mystery Men,5,21 July 2008,"I think what attracted me to this film more than anything else was the cast list, so obviously I wasn't concerned whether I'd like the film itself or not. Basically a group of wannabe superheroes: Mr. Furious (Ben Stiller) who can apparently get aggressive strength, The Shoveller (William H. Macy) who wields a shovel, and The Blue Raja (The Simpsons' Hank Azaria) who throws knives, forks and spoons, all no real powers, are ignored for real superhero Captain Amazing, real identity Lance Hunt (Greg Kinnear). But it is when the real superhero is kidnapped by recently released super villain Casanova Frankenstein (Geoffrey Rush) that they have the chance to be recognised. Before they do that though, they decide to get more wannabe superheroes, and they find The Bowler (Ratatouille's Janeane Garofalo) who has a living bowling ball (with her superhero dad's head in it), The Spleen (Pee-Wee's Big Adventure's Paul Reubens) who can create horrible stenches, The Invisible Boy (Kenan & Kel's Kel Mitchell) who can become invisible when no-one is watching and with guidance is The Sphinx (Wes Studi). Also starring Eddie Izzard as Tony P., Lena Olin as Dr. Annabel Leek, Claire Forlani as Monica the Waitress, Tom Waits as Dr. A. Heller, Louise Lasser as Violet (The Blue Raja's Mom) and Tomorrow Never Dies' Ricky Jay as Victor Weems. This is a lame comedy, little made me laugh, but that is probably the point, it might be more aimed at the kids. Worth watching!",Mystery Men
7,ccthemovieman-1,"Lightweight, Goofy & Fun",7,3 November 2006,"This was different, that's for sure. Just look at the cast! Talk about oddballs.William H. Macy and Ben Stiller were the stars, although a bunch of actors almost share the spotlight, in this farce about superhero-wannabees. The most outrageous was played by Paul Reubens of ""Pee Wee Herman"" fame.There is lots of humor, garish colors and no lulls. It's a pretty entertaining, lightweight comedy with nothing but goofy characters, all of whom want to be heroes a la Superman, Batman, Spiderman, you name. They have talents in strange areas, however, that the real heroes don't (and don't want to!). It's silly, but you know that going on.It's also a film you can watch in installments and not really miss any continuity. It's a long movie for one so hectic, so taking a break here and there is okay. The language was tame so kids could enjoy this, too. In fact, I don't recall any swearing in here, except the guy in the theater next to me who kept uttering, ""What a dumb, f---ing movie."" I thought it was fun two hours but I'd rather watch it on DVD and take a few breaks.",Mystery Men
8,BA_Harrison,It's a mystery.,8,30 September 2012,"I'll tell you what the mystery is as far as I am concerned: how a cool, extremely witty, and thoroughly entertaining movie like this one can fail at the box-office when far less worthy films not only make massive profits, but go on to spawn umpteen often inferior sequels. It does little to build my faith in humanity.For me, Mystery Men is two hours of sheer joy, with some incredibly funny lines of dialogue, excellent special effects, imagination to spare, and wonderful characters brought to life by a superb cast, my favourite performances of the whole film being from Wes Studi as The Sphinx, who continually spouts hilarious pearls of wisdom, and Geoffrey Rush as delightfully devious villain Casanova Frankenstein.Oh well, if the general public can't appreciate such a creative, quirky and innovative gem, it's their loss; I guess it'll be up to the select few with far superior taste to keep the flame alive...",Mystery Men
9,Quinoa1984,like the heroes...,6,29 April 2000,"Mystery Men is one of those goofy summer action comedies that no one wants to see even though you might say you want to.  Like the heroes, this movie has a lot of potential in It's entertainment, but It's undermined by a incredibly stupid story that only Lloyd Christmas from Dumb and Dumber on NyQuil could figure out.  The story is comic book-like (it was based on a real comic-book) that shows a bunch of outsider heroes who have to save the cities superhero Captain Amazing (palyed OK as Greg Kinnear).  These outsider superstarsb include Mr. Furious (Ben Stiller), Blue-raja (Hank Azaria), The Shoveler (William H. Macy), Janean Garofalo (The Bowler), Kel Micthel (Invisible boy), the sphinx (Wes Studi) and The Spleen (Paul Reubens).  To be honest, I find all these actors to be talented, but the only character I liked in this film was the Spleen who was played excellently by Ruebens in his comeback performance. Not all there, but at least it gives a effort.  B-",Mystery Men
10,view_and_review,Ahead of its Time,7,23 April 2020,"This movie was positively silly yet so funny. In fact, I'd say that ""Mystery Men"" was ahead of its time. With the glut of comic book movies in theaters today ""Mystery Men"" would've fit right in. It's more in line with something like ""Kick-Ass,"" but its so apropo.",Mystery Men
11,neil-476,Funny if it fits,8,17 May 2011,"Let me say that if you're not in tune with this movie, you're going to hate it.It tells the story of a group of super-heroes (in a world where some individuals are blessed with super-powers) whose powers are, to put it generously, extraordinarily lame. Fortunately, even though they do their best to help by banding together, their help is not needed because their city has a resident super-hero. Less fortunately, due to a mishap at their hands, he dies, and they have to come into their own to fight a super-villain.This delightfully loopy movie is blessed with a first rate cast. They play the material absolutely straight, and the movie is all the better for that (insofar as you can play straight the idea of someone who can turn invisible, but only when no-one is looking).I don't like the expression to ""get"" something. Nonetheless, I think it fits here - if you get Mystery Men, then you'll love it and, if you don't, you won't.",Mystery Men
12,anaconda-40658,No Mystery. Just Hilarious.,8,11 August 2015,"Mystery Men (1999): Dir: Kinka Usher / Cast: Ben Stiller, Geoffrey Rush, Greg Kinnear, William H. Macy, Claire Forlani: A celebration of the ordinary man taking a stand against a corrupt society. There is Mr. Furious, played by Ben Stiller who is empowered by his temper. William H. Macy plays the Shoveler who fights using a shovel. Hank Azaria plays a master of silver wear. The Bowler uses a swift bowling ball that shelters her father's skull. Spleen has lethal gas. Invisible Boy is pretty self explanatory. They are all taught by Sphinx who is given many of the funniest lines. Story regards the capture of Captain Amazing by the evil Cassanova Frankenstein leaving our amateur heroes to save the day. Overlong cartoon violence directed by Kinka Usher who exploits every cliché within reach. Greg Kinnear is hilarious as Captain Amazing who solved all crimes and is now reduced to promotional ads. Geoffrey Rush as Cassanova discovers the change in culture. Ben Stiller, William H. Macy and Azaria play modern heroes who play off great comic timing and chemistry. Claire Forlani is written as the standard love interest and damsel as oppose to a secret hero herself. The climax isn't as effective as it should be namely because the humour starts to drain out. On the positive end the premise is unique, and the art direction and visuals are flashy and exciting in this wonderfully realized spoof. Score: 8 ½ / 10",Mystery Men
13,Aaron1375,Thought this one would be funnier.,6,22 April 2003,"From the previews this one looked real funny, but it just wasn't as funny as it looked and should have been.  I was expecting a really good super hero spoof, what I got was a somewhat ok super hero take off.  This one has three super hero wannabes trying to rescue the one real superhero in the city. Greg Kinnear plays this super hero and is totally underused.  He made for some of the best comedy in this one and for the most part he wasn't in it. Ben Stiller is good as mister Furious and Macy as the shovel guy.  Hank Azaria is annoying though as the Blue Raija and Garrafolo isn't funny as the Bowler.  Reubens is also underused.  The villains should have been funnier too.  This one just was a little too serious considering it is supposed to be about wannabe superheroes.",Mystery Men
14,Mr-Fusion,Even the losers get lucky sometimes,7,4 November 2021,"I can imagine a teenager's sketchbook full of these superhero rejects:
The domesticated vigilante with a shovel
The goth chick who talks to her bowling ball
The leather-clad short guy with anger issues
The fartmongerAll of these hero wannabes make up the Mystery Men, none of whom are exciting in their own right yet I found myself really getting into the humor. Especially when you've got Greg Kinnear (perfect casting, by the way) as the city's ""real"" hero, an arrogant ass of the highest order.I can easily see the core joke of this movie wearing thin after a while, but it doesn't. I think the cast is perfect, the gags all land for the most part and . . . You know what this is, this is The Tick with that biting late-'90s sense of humor. I didn't know that was missing in my life, but here we are.",Mystery Men

16,Lejink,Comic cuts,7,23 March 2011,"I'm a big comic-book fan so this spoof of the genre was a treat for me helped by the fact that it's a hoot, with plenty of comic situations and big laugh-out-loud laughs along the way. The idea of a second division of lesser wannabe super-heroes together with their frustrations at and jealousy of the premier guy Captain Amazing is great for a kick-off, taking it a step further and portraying these would be stars as ordinary people, meeting in coffee bars, interacting with their mothers, wives and girlfriends, as well as their own internecine rivalry is fertile ground for comedy and it's not wasted either.I love the Mystery Men's second-rate powers, like the Blue Raja's ability to throw cutlery, or the Bowler's to throw a bowl and Ben Stiller's Mr Furious to, well, get angry. I also love the name of their master-villain nemesis Casanova Frankenstein, as well as the team's encounters with the so-mysterious The Sphinx who delivers his sage wisdom in a host of hilarious contradictory sayings.All the actors convince in their unlikely roles by playing it dead straight. I almost had a double-take when I saw and heard the usually sozzled, grizzle-voiced singer Tom Waits enjoying himself as the mad inventor Doc Heller (talk about your bold casting, it would have been so easy to call up Christopher Lloyd!) while Geoffrey Rush and Eddie Izzard ham and camp, hamp if you like, their roles as the super villain and his right-hand man.In the heroes camp, Stiller is fine as the well-balanced Mr Furious - he has a chip on both shoulders but the scene-stealer here is William H Macy's turn as the Shoveller, the reasoning, beating heart of the group, even more than Stiller.The production values are laudably high, especially the cinematography, with the reproduction of the bustling metropolis, the special effects of Frankenstein's big bad weapon's powers and the interiors at his criminal mansion all excellently done. There are plenty of laughs too, mixing the droll with the big laughs, my favourite scenes including Stiller's disaffection with the Sphinx, Invisible Boy's explanation of his powers (he can't turn invisible if people are watching him!) and the ridiculous different groups of henchmen Casanova surrounds himself with, including fur-loving dancing females, a bunch of Frat Boys and Izzard's Disco Boys.I'm sorry to see from the numbers that this film was a flop on release as I would have liked to have gotten to know these reprobates much better - I guess they should have recruited Box-Office Boy to come to their rescue...",Mystery Men
17,bowmanblue,The Avengers they are not,8,10 September 2017,"It's hard to imagine a year go by where you don't see someone in a latex body-stocking flying through the sky while buildings crumble all around them. Or, in other words, a superhero movie. Marvel's dominance reigns supreme these days and DC does its best to mop up any gap in the filmic calendar year that Marvel don't already have a stranglehold on. However, back in the 'olden days' of 1999, just dressing someone up in a silly costume wasn't enough to guarantee a billion dollars at the Box Office. That's probably why 'Mystery Men' never really made much of an impact back then and only really fills a niche gap in the market today. We're introduced to a world of superheroes, or rather ONE superhero – the unsubtly-titled 'Captain Amazing' – a man who has dedicated his life to protecting the city from wrong-doers and has therefore enjoyed all the lucrative benefits that come with it, i.e. corporate sponsorship and women. In fact, he's protected the city so well that there's hardly a super villain left worthy enough to take him on. So, while he spends much of his time as his (completely unrecognisable, glasses-wearing) alter-ego, it's up to another band of 'heroes' to mop up the few thieves still daring to snatch old ladies' purses. However, these heroes are anything but 'super.' Their 'powers' are unusual at best. We have a man who gets angry to the point of, er, being very angry. A man who puts on a fake British accent while he throws forks and a guy who hits people with a shovel. Not a Batarang to be seen among them! Nowadays, when you look at the cast of 'Mystery Men' it almost reads like a who's who of Hollywood. Yet, back then all the stars seemed to be faces who you kind of knew because you'd seen them before in oh, you know it was him out of that thing on TV. You have Ben Stiller, William H Macy, Greg Kinnear, Eddie Izzard and Geoffrey Rush to name but a few. It's a pretty impressive ensemble, so I always wondered why it was never bigger than it seemed to be. I guess at the time people may have thought it was a superhero movie and, due to the public seemingly thinking that all superhero movies were like 'Batman and Robin' they stayed away, plus Ben Stiller's star hadn't quite peaked back then, so it couldn't ride on his future post 'Something About Mary' popularity. Plus it might be difficult to market, as, on first inspection, you could be mistaken for thinking it was a 'proper' superhero film, i.e. complete with giant budget and epic action set-pieces. Then again, if you look closely at the silly costumes and the fact that one woman is using the skull of her father inside a 'magic' bowling ball as a weapon, you could be forgiven for thinking that it's a straight comedy. However, again, it may have many funny moments, but you wouldn't call it a 'laugh-a-minute' ride.'Mystery Men' is one of those films that dips in and out of various genres. Personally, I'd call it a 'satire of the superhero genre.' Now, I enjoy both DC and Marvel's current crops so I like to think I'm well up on the various conventions and clichés associated with the genre. Therefore, when I watch 'Mystery Men' I can appreciate how much work has gone into lampooning it. However, when it was released the genre it was parodying wasn't established enough to really sell this movie. If you're looking for something that takes a satirical, yet loving, swipe at all things superhero-related, then you should definitely check this out. Don't expect total action. Don't expect outright comedy. Expect a subtle blend of the two. If you've ever read the cult comic 'Astro City' you'll know the tone of this film.",Mystery Men
18,capone666,The Vidiot Reviews...,7,13 August 2018,"Mystery MenWhen assembling a superhero team remember to get membership fees upfront.Not to say all caped crusaders are cheap, but the ones in this comedy sure are.With Captain Amazing (Greg Kinnear) keeping Champion City crime free it leaves little for other heroes like Mr. Furious (Ben Stiller), The Shoveler (William H. Macy) and The Blue Raja (Hank Azaria) to do. That is until Captain Amazing disappears and his old rival (Geoffrey Rush) reappears.Now the second-stringers must expand their roster to thwart the villain and save the city.Twenty-years too early, this lampoon of comic book troupes would be at home in today's movie market more than 1999's. However, that doesn't stop this adaptation of the underground comic from being a hilarious critique of super-teams that still holds true.Incidentally, one surefire way of getting yourself on the Justice League is by having the same blood type as Batman.

19,The-Sarkologist,A spoof on superhero movies,6,17 October 2013,"The year is 1999 and the place is Champion City and all of the super villains are either dead or behind bars, so in a city over run with super heroes, there is no work. So the greatest super hero, Captain Amazing, decides to manipulate a few things to keep his sponsorship, and releases Cassanova Frankinstein. Unfortunately Cassanova gets the better of him and kills him so it is up to a hopeless trio: the Blue Rajah, The Shovel, and Mr Furious, to get him back. Unfortunately they are hopeless so they recruit some more, landing up with the Invisible Man, the Spleen, and the Bowler's daughter. Then the Sphinx, a mysterious figure, turns up to train them.This movie, which is actually based on a comic series of the same name, is a farce of super hero movies. The mad inventor emphasises that all of his inventions are non-lethal, the Blue Rajah throws spoons and forks, but not knives, the Shovel is married with kids and his wife tries to tell him that maybe the superhero business is not cut out for him, and nobody finds Mr Furious threatening, at all.It is a cute little movie and deals with these mystery men's right of ascension. Now that Captain Amazing is dead, a new lot of super heroes are needed, and unfortunately all they have are these guys. The Blue Rajah lives with his mother and Mr Furious is trying too hard to be something that he is not. In the end, when Mr Furious comes to terms with who he really is, a guy named Roy, then he becomes Mr Furious.This is a pretty cool movie, and I do recommend it, but it is not one that stands out so much that one would want to see it again and again. I guess there is a little criticism here, but in the end any comment that it would want to make, simply falls down into a pool of laughs and weirdness. It may be weird, but it is not the weird that makes me interested in the movie.",Mystery Men
20,poe426,Intentionally hilarious...,10,17 March 2009,"Unlike, say, the superhero movies made by directors like, oh, say, Joel Schumacher, MYSTERY MEN, while it's played straight (and, no, that's not a jab at Schumacher), just happens to be one of the great barrels of laughs. I saw it not once but twice during its initial theatrical release, and left the theater laughing on both occasions. I went in knowing absolutely nothing about the movie (but thinking that it might have something to do with the Mystery Men of Golden Age comic fame). What a pleasant surprise it was. Hank Azaria's Blue Raja reminded me more than just a little of Mac Raboy's beautifully rendered Golden Age hero THE GREEN LAMA- without the refinement. (Though he also looks not unlike another Raboy-rendered hero, IBIS THE INVINCIBLE.) Greg Kinnear was never, ever funnier (and his ""rescue"" makes me laugh out loud every time I see it), nor was Geoffrey Rush (so brilliant in QUILLS, so side-splittingly funny here). The only wannabe superhero missing, I think, was Damon Wayans's Handi-man (see IN LIVING COLOR) (and, yes, I thought THE RINGER was funny- ""Little Jeffie Dahmer!""). Wes Studi delivered the most twisted lines with the straightest face, though I would've called him The Sphincter rather than The Sphinx... (Although THE SPHINX happens to have been a ""real"" hero who was featured in his own ""real"" comic book.) Who wants to be a superhero? (Just about everybody, it seems.) At the time of its release, MYSTERY MEN was one of only a handful of superhero movies to be found in theaters and it was most welcome; it still is.",Mystery Men
21,BaronBl00d,As Bad As It Gets!,2,23 August 2000,"Maybe I am out of step with the times. Maybe I have an old-fashioned sense of humor.  Maybe I just have taste.  This film was bad.  There are no two ways about it.  It was so bad that it was almost unwatchable - it was unbearable to see so many talented actors waste their gifts in a muddled script that tried to strive for sophmoric humor and failed.  The concept was intriguing, yet the execution was poor.   Ben Stiller leads a band of super hero wannabes - one of them throws forks with no accuracy at all, another beats people up with a shovel, Janeane Garafalo throws a ball with a skull in it, one guy claims to be invisible yet cannot do it, and Paul Reubens flagellates with room-clearing strength.  Okay, now I know some of this is obviously not meant to be taken as high culture and that is alright, but what happened in this movie is that it is a series of sketches with little depth.  Each scene going for some crude outlandish joke that, in many cases, is just not funny at any level.  Most of the performances were decent, but the dialogue they had to utter was horrible.  ""May the Forks be with you"" is just one example of the strained comedy being pushed into the film.  Geoffrey Rush, yes the oscar winner, gives an incredibly over the top performance.  Paul Reubens gives a nice performance( nice to see someone utilizing his many talents), and Greg Kinnear probably has some of the funniest scenes as a real super hero caught up in endorsements.  Again, maybe it is just me. Maybe I am just too serious to appreciate this level of humor.  I don't know.",Mystery Men

23,Movie_Muse_Reviews,Superheroes combine with ragtag rejects in a poorly imagined spoof,5,17 September 2008,"With the opportunity to show characters that are misfit superheroes that can be whatever the writer wants, it's pretty sad when ""Mystery Men"" is what made the final cut. It would seem on premise that this would be ripe with great satire, but instead you mostly get mush. The team handling this film should be pretty ashamed.""Mystery Men"" is based on a Bob Burden Dark Horse comic, which I'll admit I know nothing about, but I assume it's got some artistic integrity and way more than this film has. The characters all seem interesting enough and their backgrounds amusing, but all of that potential is completely disregarded to make room for stupid jokes and quibbling between characters, obviously a decision from the people putting this thing together.Plotwise, Champion City is protected by Captain Amazing (Kinnear), but his success makes it tough for the small-time crime fighters like Mr. Furious (Stiller), The Shoveler (Macy) and the Blue Raja (Azaria) to make a difference. Of course that changes when Casanova Frankenstein (Rush) is released from an asylum and captures Amazing.The problem here is just a lack of depth. While the plot sounds childish, there is some good spoofing going on, like how Cpt. Amazing is Lance Hunt without glasses but nobody has figured it out. Overall, it just never seems to go far enough and gets traded in for characters arguing with the old ""no, you tell me,"" routine and useless taking over the world schemes. While some of the characters are funny, we never get enough of their personalities, just their hit or miss jokes.The color palette for this film was interesting yet scattered-brained as well and the costumes were all over the place. I think in general, lack of sufficient direction is this film's greatest weakness. I'm not surprised director Kinka Usher has never done anything and hasn't since ""Mystery Men."" There is no exact vision for this film other than ""hodge-podge"" and slapstick. In the right hands, these interesting characters could have really taken life and the humor would have followed along with it.",Mystery Men
24,dfranzen70,Harmless fun won't ever be confused with solid entertainment,6,15 January 2000,"The recent trend of transforming comic book characters into feature films has re-proven the long-held belief that Hollywood knows more about staging special effects and glossing over intricacies than it does about script coherency. Add that trend to the trend of having less-than-superheroes as the protagonists of their own films, and you get Mystery Men as a result.This movie is about the efforts of a disparate group of five 'heroes' to thwart an Evil Guy in his attempts to do something-or-other to a fictional city. (It's conflicts like these that are the staple of many a comic book, aren't they?)Will our heroes save the day? Is there water in the ocean? Of course they will!So what kind of heroes do we have? Well, we have Mr. Furious (Ben Stiller), whose superpower is that he's..... well, furious; The Blue Raja (Hank Azaria), who throws his mother's cutlery and speaks with a British accent, even though he's neither British not clad in blue; The Spleen (Paul Reubens), whose flatulence will level people for several yards; The Shoveler (William H. Macy), whose prowess with the titular garden implement is legendary; The Bowler (Janeane Garofalo), who tosses a bowling ball that happens to house the skull of her dead father, himself a noteworthy bowler; and Invisible Boy (Kel Mitchell), who only turns invisible if absolutely no one is looking at him at the time.Let's face facts here. This is not a complex movie. You know who your good guys are and you know who the bad guy is (Geoffrey Rush, in an ineffectual performance). You might not be entirely clear on what the bad guy wants to accomplish, but who gives a darn anyway? The characters all seem to be having a grand old time, and there's good chemistry between them (although it would have been nice to see more interplay between Stiller and Garofalo, who have been close friends in real life for a long time).
Bottom line is this: You won't be offended by much in Mystery Men (unless you can't stomach fart jokes), but your mind won't be terribly stimulated, either. All in all, it's a fair-to-middling kind of movie - the kind that makes you feel a little unsatisfied when it's over, like maybe it didn't quite fulfill its potential.",Mystery Men
25,noralee,"Good Looking, But Thin Comic Book as Movie",4,21 December 2005,"I went to see ""Mystery Men"" because the script writer Neil Cuthbert was our class clown in high school. And this sophomoric humor does sound like the same jokes he told when he was a sophomore.In fairness, I bet that most of the strained funny bits weren't his ideas but were in the basic concepts of the comic book series this is based on, such as the very funny themed gangs, especially Disco Guys and Frat Boys, as I don't remember him being particularly into comic books then. The kids in the audience laughed at every fart of course, but there were plenty of other times they weren't laughing.The leads make interesting characters. Janeane Garofalo is always fun, especially here talking to the spirit of her dead dad in a bowling ball, Ben Stiller is almost too grounded for the satire though William Macy and Hank Azaria manage to straddle the pitiful and satirical with a nice balance. The director Kinka Usher has a cameo, as does Mark Mothersbaugh who did some of the music.The art direction and costuming are absolutely terrific, like a satire of a Tim Burton movie. The camera is endlessly busy, though not enough to cover up lags such that I actually started to think about work instead. The battles are really mean, with participants really getting beat up distastefully, though Tom Waits was clear as a mad inventor that he wanted non-lethal fighting.

26,NateWatchesCoolMovies,An absurdist classic,9,14 June 2016,"I've always been both fascinated and puzzled by Mystery Men. It's essentially a titanic budget spent on a bunch of inane tomfoolery that makes sense neither as satire, straight up comedy, serious superhero fare or anything in between. And yet, it's so much fun, coming out a complete winner despite any odds it dodges on the way. I bring it up because Suicide Squad is coming soon, and for whatever reason every trailer and bit of marketing for it so far reminds me of this one. Couldn't even really say why, just something about the vibe and aesthetic of both films that seems distantly related. Could just be me being strange, which is the word in question for this one. It's bizarre beyond belief, stylized to a point where Dr. Seuss would get dizzy and full of abstract, off the wall humour that requires you to coast along in the same delirium as the characters before you really get it. It takes place in Champion City, a cluttered metropolis that makes Gotham look like dullest suburbia. It's a place populated by heinous, eccentric super villains, one legitimate superhero and a bunch of misfits who fancy themselves costumed crimefighters. When theatrical arch menace Casanova Frankenstein (Geoffrey Wright proved to me that he could top Barbosa, no easy feat in my books) is booted from prison, he launches into his old ways, ransacking the city and bringing hero Captain Fantastic (Greg Kinnear), to his knees. It's now up to a hilarious group of lovable buffoons to bring him and his minions down. You better sit down before I describe these guys, cuz they're too good to be true. Ben Stiller is Mr. Furious, a dude who believes he can get so angry he has super strength... except..not. William H. Macy plays The Shoveler, who pretty much shovels. Janeane Garofalo is The Bowler, who carries a ball with the essence of her superhero dad trapped inside. Kel Mitchell is the Invisible Boy, who is only invisible when nobody is looking. My favourite by far is The Blue Raja (a scene stealing Hank Azaria), a turban wearing, plummy British accent spouting dude whose weapons of choice are forks, which he flings about the place like ninja stars. I could go on and on about every little quirk and stroke of genius, but I'd rather let you discover it all yourself, and immerse yourself in the giddy treasure chest that is this film. I must make mention of Tom Waits as a scientist who designs elaborate and ""non lethal"" weapons. Man, this movie rocks. Additional flair is provided by Lena Olin, Ned Bellamy, Claire Forlani, Paul Reubens, Wes Studi (whose character cuts guns in half with his mind and blurts out endless paradoxical platitudes) and Eddie Izzard. There's a few hidden moments of emotion that take you off guard like easter eggs amongst the lunacy, for all you folks who want a side of seriousness with your buffoon burger. This isn't everyone's thing, but check 'er out anyways, just to make sure. It's one of my favourites.",Mystery Men
27,questl-18592,Super Friends Unite!,8,23 April 2021,"1999 was a crazy year for film and it's really wild for me to think back on how different movies were back then compared to now and Mystery Men, in a lot of ways, really embodies that. There is NO way this movie gets made today looking even remotely like it does now. It's such a quirky and dark movie and I love the like Junkyard Gothic stylings going on here. It's hilarious, it's creative, inventive and just an absolute blast of a film, especially for a superhero fan who wants something different. Great performances all around, fun albeit cheesy effects and just an overall good time.Mystery Men is one of those movies I can watch anytime, regardless of where it's starting from and enjoy it. It's the kind of movie I've always wanted more of and would love to see turned into a weird TV show, mostly cause I don't trust anyone to make a proper film sequel.

28,a_chinn,Bob Burden's great comic and a terrific cast are wasted on an unfunny script,4,28 December 2017,"I'm a huge fan of comic book writer/artist Bob Burden. The Flaming Carrot by Burden remains my favorite comic of all-time. The Mystery Men was a spinoff series from The Flaming Carrot, about a league of second tier super heroes of which The Carrot was a member. The story concept of wannabe superheroes and villains is ripe for comedy, since self-serious comic book movies are ripe for satire, but what ends up on screen here sadly is not all that funny or biting. The humor of the comic books were decidedly absurdist and wildly funny if you appreciate that sense of humor, but the humor of the film is much more conventional and revolves more around silly super powers, purposefully corny dialogue, and fart jokes. The film is only made watchable by virtue of it's stellar cast (William H. Macy as The Shoveler, Hank Azaria as Blue Raja, Janeane Garofalo as The Bowler, Paul Reubens as The Spleen Ben Stiller as Mr. Furious, Wes Studi as The Sphinx, Geoffrey Rush as Casanova Frankenstein, Lena Olin as Dr. Anabel Leek, Eddie Izzard as Tony P, Artie Lange as Big Red, Claire Forlani as Monica, Tom Waits as Doc Heller, Louise Lasser as Violet, Ricky Jay as Vic Weems, Dane Cook as The Waffler, Doug Jones as Pencilhead, Dana Gould as Squeegeeman). Greg Kinnear also appears in the film as the one top tier superhero, Captain Amazing, who when he is captured by villains, the Mystery Men have to step up to save him and Champion City. The film also includes odd cameos and bit parts by Michael Bay, Mark Mothersbaugh, Riki Rachtman, CeeLo Green, Jody Watley,, Doug Jones, and Dana Gould. The film was (over) directed by commercial director Kinka Usher, who has since directed no other feature films, but I think a majority of the film's failure lies with the script by Neil Cuthbert, who's other writing credits include the notable Eddie Murphy bomb, ""The Adventures of Pluto Nash."" According to IMDB, Danny DeVito was at one point set to direct and star as The Shoveller, and I can't help but think DeVito would have embraced the absurdist humor of the source material and would have consequentially made a much better film. Instead, we're left with a barely watchable comedy that feels like a sadly missed opportunity. If you do want a GOOD comedy about second tier superheroes, watch James Gunn's underrated ""The Specials"" or his darker superhero comedy ""Super"" instead.",Mystery Men
29,Spleen,First-rate comedy about second-rate characters,8,11 June 2000,"I make just one apology for this film: there are far, far, too many wide angle close-ups, and if they irritate you beyond endurance, fair enough. They drove ME barmy for the first ten minutes or so.  But after that I made a kind of a truce with the terrible cinematography; and long before the end of the film, I had ceased to care.  This is too rich a comedy to be destroyed so easily.  It's hilarious, it's witty, the comic delivery of ALL of the cast is flawless, and however much Usher peers at his characters through a cold, fish-eye lens - HE may not care for them much - he manages to present them with warmth.  `Mystery Men' is, in fact, not only funnier, not only more clever, but also deeper, than anyone seems to have given it credit for being.  The jokes in the Austin Powers movies, for instance, as well as being less funny than the jokes here, are also much more toothless. The satire of `Mystery Men' bites when there's something worth biting and gnaws gently when there isn't.  It doesn't mock just any old thing.  Which is why, contrary to what some (I must regard them as unobservant) critics have said, it never runs out of ideas.The `super' heroes are an attractive bunch.  Sure, they're second-rate, but they're not merely second rate.  The Blue Rajah, for instance, does nothing but throw cutlery at people, and he isn't THAT good at it.  On the other hand, neither is he comically bad.  He's better in his limited field than most people, and he DOES practise diligently.  He's not a buffoon, which makes him a much funnier character than if he was.  If Superman is Christ in a cape, the Mystery Men are all the minor demigods from the foothills of Mount Olympus, in capes.  Much funnier; also much more endearing.",Mystery Men

As much as it hurts me, since I love the 1990s Simpson's so much, I have to point out that Hank Azaria sets a new low of irritating characterizations in this movie. I mean, I started to actively hate him before the first scene was over.
I'm only glad I watched this on TV in my bungalow, where leaping out a window to kill myself in despair would only lead to a mild ankle sprain.

31,Rob_Taylor,Very underrated movie,8,24 July 2004,"Mystery Men is one of those films that never did that well at the box-office but which is destined to attract a devoted following. The first time I saw the movie I wasn't overly impressed. But with subsequent viewings I find it grows on you more and more.One of the greatest things any movie can do is to plant a catch-phrase or line of dialogue in your head. Whether it's Caveman's ""Tonda"" or The Princess Bride's ""Inconceivable"", these movies manage to plant this word or phrase and then you just can't get it out of your head. With Mystery Men you get two phrases planted, though phrase is a poor choice of words. Let's say you get two concepts. The first is Mr Angry's broken sentencing describing what's happening to himself - ""Vision dimming......blood draining.......consciousness failing!"" kind of comment. The second is down to The Sphinx, who's pearls of wisdom amount to little more than common sense wrapped up in a mystical phrase ""You must master your fears, or your fears will master you!""These comments I'll never get out of my head and show that the movie had an impact on me. All too often I watch a film and then can't remember much about it after a few hours. Mystery Men at least has left me with (a mostly useless) legacy of itself in those comments.As to the film itself you can do far worse. The drawing point here is that all the superheroes are completely inept and hardly ""super"" at all. In fact, only a few of them really have any powers at all. The Invisible Boy who can only become invisible when no-one is watching. Mr Angry, who , for virtually the whole movie, really only pretends to be a tower of rage. The Spleen, who has noxious farts etc. You get the idea. Of course, in the end, their powers prove just the right mix to get the job done.The movie is harmless fun and is a refreshing change from the serious, angst-ridden superhero movies we're seeing today. A very refreshing change.If you were disappointed by the likes of Daredevil and Spiderman and The Hulk, then give this one a whirl. It's a lot more fun.",Mystery Men

Very.If you didn't find it so, keep an open mind while reading the rest of this review, because you're not likely to agree with anything else I say here.Mystery Men is one of the strongest entries into a film genre known as 'stupid humour'. (a-la Monty Python) You laugh because it's so outrageous and unbelievable, it's funny. Many people just don't 'get' this sort of humour, and that's OK. (incidentally, the secret to enjoying this kind of humour is to not try to understand it, and just go along with it) But even those who do not usually like this kind of humour should still be blown away by this film. Mystery Men was exactly what it wanted to be, which is outrageous, original and enormously funny on the way.The plot, which is spontaneous and very original, mocks all the clichéd superhero films we know and love. I won't reveal it here, but rest assured: you'll never view a 'serious' superhero movie the same way again!This movie has one of the most incredible casts in film history, (which is kind of surprising, considering it had a first time director and no script tagged onto it) with big names like Geoffrey Rush, Lena Olin, William H. Macy, Greg Kinnear and Eddie Izzard popping up as well as other well known actors like Ben Stiller, Hank Azaria, Janeane Garofalo, Wes Studi and Claire Forlani. Everyone in this movie did a great job, there was absolutely no bad acting whatsoever. (I think that's the first time I've ever been able to say that and actually mean it!) Particular standing out performances were Geoffrey Rush as devious-yet-charming borderline OTT German villain Casanova Frankenstein, and Hank Azaria as the fork-flinging Blue Raja who would love to be British. The incredibly plastic faced Greg Kinnear as mock superhero Captain Amazing and Janeane Garofalo as the sarcastic Bowler also both did great jobs, but as I said earlier, there was no one who gave what you would call a 'bad' performance. Even the extras showed competent acting skills, which is definitely a first.Kinka Usher, with his feature film directorial debut, does prove to be a slightly shaky director, but with the help of the totally inspired cast, he pulls it off OK. Apparently, there was no official script for the film (there was a storyline, but all exact dialogue was invented by the actors, and changed as they went along - an excellent way for the actor to get in touch with their character!) but there were so many great lines that you would never have guessed so. The sets were completely inspired, and added to the humour of the film - you'd start with a 50's ish diner, than move on to Chinese and Mexican buildings almost immediately next door. This is a way of parodying the merging of different cultures in the States, exaggerated terribly so the audience gets the point. (or so we would hope!) The movie's music was also very good, adding to the superhero-parody mood.This is one of my favorite movies of all time, due to it's sheer originality and great acting, and the fact that it has some of the most spontaneous and original humour in film history. Please don't miss Mystery Men! (especially for Monty Python fans! This is a very similar type of humour) It will completely revolutionize your way of thinking!

37,lambiepie-2,Another cute idea...so what didn't work?,3,25 July 2006,"This was one of the best ideas to come along in a while: to feature a group of 'super heroes' who weren't that 'super' and 'majestic' but every day kinda heroes..to a degree...more or less.Films like 'Metor Man' and 'Blank Man' also tried a similar formula and didn't catch on very well either. But this one, ""Mystery Men"" had a better chance, and tried to go the dark humor and campy way - maybe not dark enough or campy enough and turned out sillier than expected. But truly this is NOT a bad thing, but not a good thing for a film overall.The most noticeable cast that didn't work for me was Ben Stiller as Mr. Furious. It played camp - dull camp. I didn't care much for Paul Ruben's Spleen character either - just another excuse to throw in immature ""fart jokes"" wherever possible.Casts that worked better was Jeanne Garafalo as Baby Bowler, Hank Azaria as the Blue Raja, and William H. Macy as the Shoveller. Kel Mitchell as the Invisible Boy was working until we were still left in doubt (to me... just to plug in a genital joke) and Wes Studi as the Sphinx character was fine. So why did I give it a ""3""? The best character cast with the material as given was Casanova Frankenstein as played by Geoffrey Rush - a great look into 'pre-Barbossa'. A must not miss. Played ridiculously, campy and chewing the scenery every time he appeared ...but what a hoot! By adding in the horrible ""Disco Boys"" gang with this performance, it was funny as all send ups can be....and yes, Eddie Izzard's performance as Tony P. was so dead on for a 20 years past 'disco boy' -- these were the only times I laughed when these characters appeared on the screen.Now, there is something to be said about Greg Kennear and his Captain Amazing's character. As far as working with what he had, it was a good performance. Where they took this 'hero' and why was a fine touch but the rest of the film didn't seem glue tight around it.This is not to write this is a bad film and not worth your time. You'll probably get amused here and there depending on your humor level. It is not a 'bad' film but not as great as it ... could have been. It's like knowing you have bunch of 'A' students working on material you assume will be an 'A' but turns out to be a 'D'.So I propose...do a remake.

39,IonicBreezeMachine,One of the better superhero comedies that didn't find an audience upon release.,7,8 November 2020,"Roy (Ben Stiller), Jeffrey (Hank Azaria), and Eddie (William H. Macy) are three friends who moonlight as superheroes Mr. Furious, Blue Raja, and The Shoveler in the metropolis of Champion City. The trio are fairly inept when it comes to crime fighting and are often overshadowed by the Arrogant and much more popular Captain Amazing (Greg Kinear). However when Amazing arranges for the release of supervillain Casanova Frankenstein (Geoffrey Rush) so he can boost his image by having a more credible threat the plan backfires with Amazing becoming captured putting the city in danger that only the titular Mystery Men can stop.Loosely based on the comic book series Flaming Carrot Comics by Bob Burden, the movie is a contemporary spoof of the superhero genre (with Joel Schumacher's Batman films serving as the main source of inspiration). The movie features a large number of comic actors including Including Paul Rebens, Janeane Garofalo, and Kel Mitchell having prominent roles. The movie is very loosely structured as much of the dialogue was improvised, and while not every joke lands and the movie does feel over stretched in some areas Mystery Men is still a superior example of the superhero comedy subgenre.The cast have genuine chemistry and there's an obvious amount of love for the superhero genre on display. The scenes where Roy, Jeffrey, and Eddie converse at an all night diner are a lot of fun as they point out foibles in the Champion City superhero scene (including a trope involving glasses that is very funny). The superhero personas created by the lovable losers are also quite funny with Mr. Furious being a sort of inept and powerless Hulk, and Blue Raja scoring a lot of laughs from his confusing hero name that involves a turban, forks, and yet not much of the color blue. But easilly the best performances are Wes Studi as The Sphinx and Janeane Garofalo as The Bolwer. Wes Studi has a lot of fun playing an over the top parody of Mentor figures like Yoda, Splinter, Or Stick with cryptic dialogue that sounds deep but is more like a string of non sensical metaphors and similes only tangentially related to the situation. Garofalo is also quite good as The Bowler who scores a number of laughs talking to her bowling ball that houses her deceased father's skull and soul that only she can talk to and her timing and improv is pitch perfect.Despite the positives that are on display in the film, there are some drawbacks. Because of the loose improv heavy structure of the movie, some actors don't work as well as others. Paul Reubens is better known for his work as Pee-Wee Herman and known for visual gags and prop jokes and he unfortunately doesn't adapt well to the improv based structure playing flatulence based hero The Spleen. Kel Mitchell fares a bit better playing The Invisible Boy (whose explanation for his powers is one of the funniest in the movie), but Kel much like Reubens isn't primarily known for improv and doesn't have many standout comic moments (though admitedly he does better than Reubens). The movie was directed by commercial director Kinka Usher (who directed a number of Taco Bell's popular Chihuahua commercials throughout the 90s) and he has a good grasp of comedy and pacing, but it's clear he didn't have experience in reining in such a large group of comic actors which leads to some issues with pacing. It's a shame Kinka Usher left the industry to return to commercial work because he seems like he could've refined his craft, but unfortunately that's how it worked out.Mystery Men is a flawed movie, but it's also a very funny and good natured comedy. The movie's affectionate ribbing of the superhero genre is never mean spirited and the cast deliver genuinely engaging performances (even if some actors struggle with the structure of the movie). Despite some hiccups this movie is a lot of fun and can be enjoyed by almost anyone.",Mystery Men
40,blott2319-1,Decent off-the-wall take on the superhero genre,7,10 September 2021,"There is an abundance of potential in Mystery Men. There were actually a number of ways I think it had a chance of being unique and special. The way the movie starts there is a great deal of evidence that no one in this world really has a superpower at all. I found that to be a fascinating concept, because a world without the supernatural that is still filled with people who fancy themselves superhuman is fun. This holds for a long period of time, but at a certain point we enter the world of fantasy and I was somewhat disappointed. It's not that the lack of superpowers was the only way to go, it just would have been the more interesting choice. I was also unhappy with the choices they made in the arc of Ben Stiller's character, Furious. It felt like they were taking him on a proper trajectory where he learns his lesson and turns over a new leaf, but then by the end we find that others are reinforcing his delusions and enabling him to continue his self-destructive lifestyle.All that being said, there's no denying that Mystery Men is a fun film. The writers may not have made all the best choices, but they certainly know how to write jokes. A big part of the humor is in the fact that the Mystery Men are so inept, and there's one scene in particular where they make downright moronic choices, and I found it hilarious. This film also finds great joy in spoofing some of the tropes that had been established at that time in superhero films. I like the ironic commercialization we see in Captain Amazing, and how he personally causes as many problems as he solves. The plot in Mystery Men is predictable, but I think that works since it is riffing off the expectations we all have when approaching a superhero film. But, most important of all, Mystery Men holds up as a film with a proper narrative even if you ignore all the tongue-in-cheek references. I enjoy it, but could have liked it just a bit more if they had taken a different direction.",Mystery Men

42,jhclues,"True Crime Fighters, Call Them What You Will",10,6 July 2000,"Director Kinka Usher stays true to his own credo, ""Play it straight and they will laugh,"" and with the help of a superb cast has crafted what should become the #1 cult film of all time, `Mystery Men.'  When an evil villain, Casanova Frankenstein (Geoffrey Rush) is released from a mental institution, captures the local superhero, Captain Amazing (Greg Kinnear), and threatens to take over Champion City, three wanna-be superheroes, Mr. Furious (Ben Stiller), The Shoveler (William H. Macy) and The Blue Raja (Hank Azaria) come to the rescue.  Frankenstein has been joined by a myriad assortment of underworld scum, however, and has become a formidable opponent.  The trio realize that help is needed, and decide to recruit; what they end up with is nothing less than the most unforgettable team of `superheroes' ever assembled in the history of the cinema.  Mr. Furious has his rage; The Shoveler, his shovel; The Blue Raja flings silverware (mainly forks, and the occasional spoon, but never a knife); the Invisible Boy (Kel Mitchell) can turn invisible as long as no one is watching; the Sphinx (Wes Studi), a heavy hitter from down south, is very mysterious and can break guns in half with his mind.  Maybe; the Bowler (Janeane Garofalo) can fling a ball with deadly accuracy; and The Spleen (Paul Reubens) wields flatulence that can incapacitate an entire room. 	This is a brilliant ensemble piece that delivers the laughs without ever becoming condescending or patronizing the audience, while playing it straight at all times.  The dialogue is witty, and the performances given by Stiller, Macy, Azaria and Garofalo are exemplary.  There is a number of memorable, hilarious scenes, especially the one in which they throw a pool party and barbecue to recruit, and conduct interviews with a stupefying assemblage of applicants; and another, in a bar, when the Bowler has a conversation with her long-dead father, whose skull has been implanted in her bowling ball.  The funniest of all, however, has to be when the team actually attempts to rescue Captain Amazing.  But these are only examples, for the entire movie is composed of one hilarious scene after another, laced with subtle humor that will keep you laughing and thinking about it for a long time.  The real secret of it's success, though, is that Usher keeps it all real; the relationships between the characters are true, and the whole concept of being a `Superhero' is played as being entirely reasonable, which somehow gives a sense of credibility to the entire proceedings.  In this world, the aspirations of Mr. Furious and the rest are tenable, and Usher keeps the laughs coming without ever resorting to slapstick or mere sight gags. 	The solid supporting cast includes Lena Olin (Dr. Annabel Leek), Eddie Izzard (Tony P.), Tom Waits (Doc Heller), Claire Forlani (Monica), Louise Lasser (The Blue Raja's mother), Jenifer Lewis (Lucille) and Pras (Tony C.). `Mystery Men' is a truly inspired movie that can be seen over and over again, with a new chuckle to be had with every viewing, guaranteed.  In the immortal words of the Sphinx, `We are number one!  All others are number two, or lower.'  Is it an Oscar-worthy movie?  Hardly; but for a good time and a lot of laughs, treat yourself to this masterwork of comedy; it's the real deal, and you won't regret it.  I rate this one 10/10.",Mystery Men

45,carbuff,One of the all-time best superhero parodies,9,19 April 2021,"To me, it's obvious that ""Mystery Men"" is a pre-9/11 film. If you think of the superhero films out at the time, this parody is quite clever, and while playing primarily off of Batman and Superman, it's just generally a really good-natured, goof-ball film about wannabe superheroes that's pretty much entirely family-friendly--not too many places where most parents and kids will feel the need to awkwardly look away from each other, at least not in today's world.I don't know how I missed this movie for more than 20 years, but I'm really glad I finally found it. As I alluded to earlier, ""Mystery Men"" harks back to a much more innocent time, even though I myself didn't find the 1990s to be exactly innocent when I was living in the midst of it. Times have changed in so many different and such harsher ways that this almost comes across as Mayberry R. F. D relative to nowadays. Yet, even today, it remains witty and sardonic fun with special effects that are slightly corny by today's standards, but still quite serviceable.I'm trying to write more without any spoilers, but I'm finding it really hard. So, I'll just say that if you enjoy superhero movies, you really should give this comedy a shot, given that today's comic book movies so often take themselves so very seriously, yet are nearly completely vacuous. This film really pokes holes in their balloons. I fully agree with another reviewer who commented along the lines that it's best to think of this film as a fore-runner of ""Kick-Ass"", and if you liked that film, there's a good chance you'll go for this one too.",Mystery Men

Because of this: the biggest hero of the town, captain Amazing (Greg Kinnear) has sold his whole appearance to promote the products of is official sponsors... a bit like the ""real heroes"" of today, the super athletes, have done eons ago.But lets get down the business shall we? The cast of the film is quite good: Hank Azaria as Blue Raja, Janeane Garofalo as the Bowler, Ben Stiller as Mr. Furious. All very, at least in my opinion, capable comedians, who deliver their lines on the mark. There are lots of laughs in the film, but then again there are lots of forced moments in the film, given the 2 hour lenght so it's not a dead laughter film, more of a occasional laughs.And from there we get to the script itself, which is okay, but there is the feel, that it could have been tightened a lot better, as of now it has some unnecessary segments, which don't serve the film one way or another.The direction is okay, but some of the visual gags miss the mark but the visual quality of the movie is okay. The fight scenes are a bit shoddily made and the overall choreography could have used a bit more thought.In overall I'd say, that MM is okay film, but this rag tag hero league could have been used to make a lot better film than this.",Mystery Men

I therefore avoided it in the theaters-- but just today watched it on DVD. I was pleasantly surprised-- although I must confess that I watched it in 10-minute chunks between chores, errands, and homework.Admittedly, the portions of the movie dealing with the locale -- Champion City -- and the parts featuring the villain were too Batmany, too dark and depressing. One found oneself grasping for some sense of what the reality of that movie world was supposed to be. And The Spleen (played by Pee Wee Herman/Paul Reuben) had face makeup so unnecessarily gross that I had to look away. And all that flatulence! And the villain's cohort was also overdone-- too many of them, too frenzied and confused.But the other themes were funny enough, and the superhero characters, for the most part, had real heart and and real dramatic lives.

49,Movie-12,Good attempt at a bad script. **1/2 out of ****,6,14 August 1999,"Director: Kinka Usher   111minutes    Rated PG-13 (for comic action violence and some crude humor)To like a movie with as much smarts as ""Mystery Men,"" one would have to be equally as intelligent. That is not saying a whole lot. ""Mystery Men"" has one of the most underdeveloped screenplays in film history, yet at the same time manages in indulge in several very funny moments, all coming from the film's oddly acted, wonderfully portrayed characters. Obviously the filmmakers have put more time into choosing the actors to play the characters than actually developing them. But even then if you have a free ticket or are at the multiplex during discount hours, you minds well take the time to see this film, but only expect a cheap laugh or two.The plot is a ""Batman"" rip-off with the spirited heart of ""The Monster Squad."" It opens giving us three wannabe superheros, The Blue Raja (Hank Azaria), who can throw forks really well, The Shoveler, (William H. Macy) who has the gift of digging extremely fast and accurately with shovels, and Mr. Furious, (Ben Stiller) who relies on his red hot temper to give him extraordinary man power. And then there's the cities most beloved crime fighter, Captain Amazing (Greg Kinnear), who not only works independently, but also has nothing to do with any other helper or fan of his in the city.When Captain Amazing discovers that he has no crime to fight because his talent is so effective, he decides to arrange the release of arch enemy currently being held in a high security prison; Cassanova Frankenstein (played effectively by Geoffrey Rush). When set free, however, Frankenstein arranges the capture and eventual disposal of his foe, Amazing, and leaves the city to be destroyed by evil and darkness when his plan dealing with a laser gun is put into focus.Who will save the city from depravity? The three who were once unheard of jokes soon bring together a team of crime fighters with super powers of their own: The Bowler (Janeane Garofalo), who seeks revenge on one of Cassanova Frankenstein's henchmen who still lives in the 70's disco era for her fathers death, Invisible Boy (Kel Mitchell of ""Good Burger""), who thinks he can turn invisible when no one is watching him, The Spleen (Paul Reubens) a disgusting male who can pass extremely nasty smelling gas when someone pulls on his fore finger, and finally The Sphinx (Wes Studi) who is the team's mysterious and wise leader.""Mystery Men"" has several good qualities. For instance, It has a message and a point to it. The film's production design looks like something out of a ""Batman"" movie that makes a city look immense and grand, at the same time week and inefficient. The designers create a vast, atmospheric mood throughout the film, releasing a sense of adventure and sometimes excitement. The great cast makes the movie, one with the level of accuracy of ""200 Cigarettes"" and ""Ed TV."" The performances were also quite the treat. It is a pleasure just perceiving these big names on the screen together.The problem comes from the severe lacking of character, mood and story development. The movie begins with a senseless action scene, never introducing any of its characters to us. The plot then jumps to problems before we have knowledge of the setting where these events are actually taking place. Even at the non-spectacular ending we have trouble understanding some of the character's action to each other, mostly because we know so little about them. I do realize this production is intended to be a comedy, and some of it is funny, but do the characters have to know so little?Kinka Usher's direction here will remain a mystery. Why would such a person let such obvious flaws pass though her finger tips and end up with such a shapeless, disorderly final production? It is easy to like ""Mystery Men"" because we like all of the people in it. However, in the end we will experience a diabolical madman's plans to take over the world and his conflicts with a squad of comical super heroes---but never really care all that much.",Mystery Men

51,Bogmeister,Blue-Collar Super-heroes say Crime Don't Pay,7,28 January 2006,"Based on Bob Burden's comic books (famous for 'Flaming Carrot') and utilizing the term ""Mystery Men"" from the golden age of mysterious costumed heroes, there's nothing very mysterious about this bunch of lower-middle class everymen who feel a need to dress up and play hero. This type of satire on super-heroes is difficult to pull off since most people think any super-hero is a satire anyway. Grown men and women dressed in strange costumes are hard to take seriously, unless you're a pre-teen, usually. This movie uses the overall silly super-hero premise as a springboard and dives headfirst into the utterly odd world of super-heroics, focusing on a group of costumed do-gooders who are blue-collar, low rent - however you want to term them. They have no money for fancy headquarters or super weapons (which most super-heroes in comic books always seem to), and even no super-powers. The Bowler (Garofalo), introduced late, does have a supernatural bowling ball she tosses about, but that's it. When you think about it, this movie presentation of super-heroes actually comes closer to depicting what it would really be like if super-heroes actually existed. I always found the endless supply of funds for HQ and transport in super-hero comics to be really tough to buy into. The satire works, for the most part. The heroes here are pretty inept. They usually start out OK on a mission, such as in the beginning, to the rescue at an old folks home. They have the right attitude and commitment. But we find that this gets them only so far, as even lousy-seeming criminals get the best of them in the end, and the heroes limp back to their homes with cuts and bruises. The core trio are very good: Mr. Furious (Stiller), the Shoveler (Macy) and Raja (Azaria) form the epicenter of a great cast. The only real hero seems to be Capt.Amazing (Kinnear), but he's an arrogant opportunist heavy into endorsements. The underdog heroes are placed in the position of rescuing him from the villain (Rush), a Germanic psycho job resembling a combo Lex Luthor/Joker, but they tend to foul things up, so we know things won't go too well. However, since their hearts are in the right place (unlike Capt.Amazing), they should persevere, with the help of the truly mysterious Sphinx (Studi). It's amusing throughout, with some of the loser-heroes, notably Stiller as Mr.Furious, trapped by in-fighting and loss of confidence. The verbal sparring between Furious and most of the others is worth a chuckle or two, especially when he challenges the sagely advice of the Sphinx. The set design and atmosphere are quite well done, having a vaguely futuristic / Gotham City feel to it. This doesn't become an instant classic, probably because of the director's inexperience. He focuses a bit too much on fancy angles & editing, taking away from the whole satirical experience. It could of used some fine-tuning in some sequences and the 3rd act seems sort of by the numbers to get things resolved in a heroic manner. But it's fairly enjoyable, reminding most of us of why we liked to sit down and read those four-color adventures in the first place: they were a fun escape from the rigors of conformity.",Mystery Men
52,EmperorNortonII,Who Says Superheroes Have To Be Super?,9,5 September 2003,"In the history of movies based on comic books, ""Mystery Men"" is one of the most underrated ones.

Macy), the Blue Rajah (Hank Azariah) and the Spleen (Paul Reubens).  ""Mystery Men"" spoofs several aspects of superhero movies like ""Superman"" or ""Batman,"" such as the pithy sayings, and the questions about secret identities.  Most of the superheroes aren't billionaires like Bruce Wayne, but blue-collar types with menial jobs and neurotic home lives. So it looks as if director Kinka Usher is making the heroes into something the average viewer can relate to.  I found ""Mystery Men"" to be visually stimulating and very funny.

53,PIST-OFF,welcome to the not-so-funhouse,5,4 December 2005,"the problem with mystery men isn't execution, it goes much deeper than that. the fact that the movie isn't very funny, save for a few, jokes and plot concepts here and there, stems not from any failure on behalf of the actors, writers, or directors. some of the jokes may have been given more life by better writing but not many. the real problem with this movie stems from the transfer of the concepts into a workable film. what might work as a joke between friends about absurdities within the superhero genre, may not translate to on screen humor very well. the effect being that we see the joke, we get it, we understand how it could be funny, but alas, it isn't now. mystery men is overflowing with that type of humor. instead of a MST3K style bashing working over an existing plot, the clever jibes are instead reformulated into plot. the idea of tom waits living in an abandoned carnival as an inventor is one joke that can be exploited with a bit of good writing. no amount of writing is going to make a shovel toting superhero funny for very long on screen. and the character of the spleen is less funny for character and more amusing because it's played by pee wee herman. the film does nobly try however and, as i said, i can easily see how the various plot details would have been funny as they were first invented, so i'll give the film five of ten for trying an unlikely idea 5 out of 10",Mystery Men

You gotta love a film with heroes like the Shoveler, Bowler, and Spleen, as well as villains like Frankenstein and the Disco Boys. William H.

Geoffrey Rush and Greg Kinnear perfectly capture their roles, as well; and Tom Waites is the icing on the cake.There is so much to recommend here it's hard to choose favorites. The hero auditions are a scream, Dr Heller's inventions are brilliant, and the Shoveler's speech is perfect. The only really weak links are the pacing just before the climax, and Ben Stiller is not quite as memorable as the rest of the cast, although he has some good scenes.This is a heck of a lot more fun than 90% of the ""serious"" superhero movies, and smarter than most comedies from the same timeframe and later.

All the actors seem to be having a blast with their roles, especially William H. Macy as the straight-arrow Shoveler, and Janeane Garofalo as The Bowler.

63,Okonh0wp,"Highly original and fresh movie, 3 1/2 Stars",10,20 April 2004,"3 1/2 stars (out of 4):On the surface, Mystery Men, is a kind of a parody of your classic superheroes and villains. Greg Kinnear plays Captain Amazing, more or less copied off of Batman, he benefits from the comical stupidity of villains, he has an incredibly obvious alter-ego personality who's a billionaire, etc. When Captain Amazing's nemesis captures him, it's up to a group of 2nd-rate superheroes to save the city, played by an ensemble of underrated stars (Well, these days Ben Stiller might be classified as overrated, as he's played the same exact role in Along Came Polly, Duplex, Meet the Parents, AND Starsky and Hutck, but this was back in 1999, so back then this ""Mr Furious"" kind of persona, was original for him).
Underneath the surface of this movie is kind of a postmodern superhero movie, echoed by the setting, which reminds me of a rust belt city, an aging town marked by decaying downtowns, abandoned amusement parks, a general lack of vibrancy and youth, but a clear picture that the city, was once long ago important. Similarly, the heroes in this movie are people who grew up watching those famous heroes Batman, Superman, Wonderwoman, etc, and are trying to invent catchy names and themes for themselves, and struggle to define themselves in an original way. Of course, as we see in the scene where the Mystery Men are cornered into a back alley by some thugs and start laughing at the thugs for being too cliched in their choice of weapons and costumes before getting the crap beaten out of them, the heroes eventually realize that they have to actually be able to fight in addition to having cool costumes.
However, out of all this comes a moral, which comes to Ben Stiller's character, Mr. Furious, who tries with no luck to pick up a waitress at a diner by impressing her with his superhero persona. For example, he talks about how dangerous the city is and suggests he walk her home because she might need protection, which she obviously doesn't buy. The waitress (Claire Folani) eventually starts liking him, but she plays pretty hard to get, and he only starts getting anywhere with her when he drops the superhero persona and starts being his self, and that's kind of the moral, which i think is a little more all-encompassing than this film. It's all about growing up with certain role models and becoming dissapointed about not living up to them. The other moral kind of comes out of William H. Macy's pep talk when everyone decides to give up, and he establishes that #1, we're not really the best heroes in the world, and #2, however, we are the only guys who can do the job and whether we accept it or not, it's up to us to stop the villain. This kind of touches up on the idea that no one really is asked to be a hero, sometimes they just have a job to do.
Anyway, I think this movie in addition to being both intelligent and hilarious, is really fresh and original. If you've read through this review, and are thinking ""huh?"", you'll know what I'm talking about, cause just the main idea and so much else in the film are really just so far out there compared to so much else.",Mystery Men

The rest of the cast are made up of too many talented comedians, who all get an equal amount of time to shine. The plot is thin, yet the laughs are heavy.

How would you do it, what name would you choose, what about the costume? How to find a weapon that suits your theme? This is the idea behind Mystery Men (based on a comic book called Dark Horse I think). Here are the least super superheros seen on the big screen. You have the Blue Raja (a superhero that is easily understood if you know your history), The Shoveller (who can shovel better than anyone else), Invisible boy (who can only turn invisible when no one is watching), Mr Furious (who thinks being an angry person makes him cool), The spleen (ummm......let's not talk about him) and of course Baby Bowler.The Casanova Frankenstein (Geoffery Rush, former struggling Sydney Stage acting and at the time Oscar winning Hollywood superstar) is released from prison and threatens the city who is going to stop him....Captain Amazing (in a bid to get better sponsorship deals).

Not-so-super superheroes banding together has been repeated since Mystery Men and has been successful, but this film was original in its time, still completely missing the mark. Get rid of the futuristic fantasy and it could be funny, set in a more normal reality. Remove the dreadful effects and set building and it could be a lot better (and cheaper). Get rid of the reliance on flatulence, wedgies, rear end jokes, etc., maybe it could be funny at some point. It's a great cast, it's not funny in the slightest. If you enjoy the very first scene, you will enjoy the film, if not, which makes sense, it remains the same for the next two hours. It drags, there's no real redemption, being silly is one thing but there is truly nothing to back it up.",Mystery Men

73,tributarystu,Just a little too idiotic,4,2 February 2003,"I know this movie is a parody. A movie about super-heroes which have not yet been found and have to struggle through life like all the other people, without really getting any appreciation. It's about the traditional bad versus evil and it also should be hilarious, or at least funny. I can say it is sometimes funny. Generally enjoyable. But just a little do idiotic. Yes, that might be the point in a parody, but I've never seen something so...terribly simple and senseless.You could say it's a traditional parody, with all the ""pompous"" super-weapons and with all the ""special"" skills of each hero and so on, and so forth. Unfortunately it is neither funny enough, nor does it have interesting elements...nothing. I insisted to see this movie because of Ben Stiller. I like him and I can't say I didn't like any of the other actors in this film. But Stiller has always made me laugh and made me feel good. This time though, all the laughing I did was at some of his scenes, but it was hardly what I expected.I can't say I felt bad during the movie, but I think in a way I was asking myself how low can you get while doing a movie. It's quite sad actually... The movie isn't serious at all and let's say that would be excusable if it was funny, but it isn't. I only liked the music, especially because I initially saw Shrek and the music made me think of that good movie. It's strange how sometimes I make these connections and usually the films have to win by them. I won't let this one affect me too much though. You really would have something better to do with your time than watching this...maybe only if you like comics so much, that eat, drink and breathe super-heroes. It's all hardly worth a 5.

But I must say this film must be one of the worst, if not THE worst movie I ever saw. I bet even the Star Wars Christmas Special is hardly worse than this.What is truly enraging is that someone (or something) authorized to spend 65m$ on this crap. AND lots of big name actors (Ben Stiller, Hank Azaria, William H. Macy, Janeane Garofalo, Paul Reubens, Greg Kinnear, Geoffrey Rush, Eddie Izzard, Claire Forlani, Tom Waits, Ricky Jay and Lena Olin) committed to this 'project'. Why? Can someone explain that to me. It must be some sort of large scale blackmail operation where they had some incriminating stuff on all these actors, no-one in their right mind would willingly want to be in this film if they read the script.Everything is terrible: the plot, the VFX are sh1t, the production design has horrendous colors and everything looks plastic and cardboard. The acting is so awful all the razzies handed out in the history of the razzies would still not be able to cover it. It is supposed to be a comedy, but there is NOTHING funny in this movie, nada. You probably don't believe me. Heck I thought 54.000 people gave it a 6/10 on IMDb, it must be okay at least. Well it's not. The film lasts an incredibly long 2 hours during which you will feel like you're dying. I literally got a headache from this film. Some of these scenes you can't begin to describe. It's an insult to the art of filmmaking. I kept staring at the screen in disbelief! I wonder if kids would like this but I wouldn't recommend showing it to them. I'm sure it will cause some sort of long term brain damage.I challenge you to see it. It's not one of those 'it's so bad it's good' films. It's just bad through and through.

76,Brogan,"A bizarre, far-out, and terrific film!",8,28 July 1999,"MYSTERY MEN is unlike any film that I have ever seen. It's rather strange on how to descrbie it.  But if I have to compare it to another film, then it's Tim Burton's BATMAN and Ridley Scott's BLADE RUNNER meets the Farley brother's DUMB & DUMBER. It's a film with excellent sets, costumes, and backgrounds mixed with outrageous humor.  And with that, I thought it was a excellent film! The plot is set in a Metropolis/Gotham City like city called Champion City.  While Metropolis has Superman and Gotham has Batman, Champion has Captain Amazing (Greg Kinner). And instead of Captain Amazing being like Superman, and just wanting to fight crime for truth, justice, and the American way, he instead fights crime for publicity.  When Captain Amazing is being told that some of the sponsors he wears on his super-suit are pulling out from sponsoring him due to lack of crime-fighting.  Amazing decides to set free one of his most notorious rivals free from the insane asylum, Dr. Cassanova Frankenstein (Geoffrey Rush).  Meanwhile, there are three superhero wanna-be's who would like to fight crime also, sadly they just don't have the luck.  One is Mr. Furious (Ben Stiller), the other is the Shoveler (William H. Macy), and the third is the Blue Raja (Hank Azaria).  They would like to assist Captain Amazing and become superhero's themselves, however they need more practice. When Dr. Frankensein kidnaps Captain Amazing, that is the calling card of the three wannabes to set fourth, save their superhero and their city.  So they recruit some more people with so-called super powers.  The Bowler (Janeane Garofalo), the Spleen (Paul Rubens), Invisible Boy (Kel Mitchell), and the Sphinx (Wes Studi).  From there on is a non-stop film with laughs and fun. I couldn't really know on what to think about MYSTERY MEN, after first watching it.  But now I realized that it is a clever and intellegent satire of the comic book stories that many of us grew up with.  It is indeed funny at times, and at other times, it gets weird.  But it never gets dull or boring throughout the movie, and I was glad of that. I thought the sets were amazing in the HAUNTING, but now I think the HAUNTING looks plain compared to the sets of MYSTERY MEN.  The sets for MYSTERY MEN were outstanding!!  Mixing it with BATMAN and BLADE RUNNER and Terry Gilliam's BRAZIL, it's some of the most fantastic sets that I have ever seen!  I would be disappointed if it doesn't win a Oscar. The acting in this film is also quite good.  Rush, Kinner, Studi, Rubens, and Azaria all do a good job in their roles.  However the three that stood out were Macy, Stiller, and Garofalo.  Garofalo is particularly good as the smarty Bowler who is heroic, yet has a smart alec attitude and talks to her bowling ball with the skull of her dead father's head. Overall, MYSTERY MEN is a delightful treat, a great tounge-in-cheek homage to the classic superhero comics that we all grew up on, mixed with plot twists and modern humor.  I think those who love comic books or comic style movies will love this movie like I did.  However, those who are expecting just a comedy will probably not like it that much.  But I highly enjoyed it and think it's one of the best films this year!  I'm hoping that first time director Kinka Usher is planning on doing a follow-up to MYSTERY MEN, because it would be fun to see these wannbe super heros again fighting for justice.  A unique treat for comic buffs that will become a cult film! ***** (out of five)",Mystery Men

There's still a borderline cartoonish vibe to it all, and it feels a lot like Batman and Robin, atmospherically. The setting is clearly a parody of Gotham, but they take it a step further with the ambiguity, including various languages and cultures in the surroundings. This was an attention to detail I hadn't noticed even on my first 10 views growing up. I write this review after seeing it for the first time (a) in over 5 years and (b) in HD. On top of the fun, albeit outlandish, action, there's a lot of silly comedy that fans of Ben Stiller especially should be familiar with, but really everyone plays their part perfectly. Other favorites of mine were Janeane Garofalo and Paul Reubens, although Geoffrey Rush as the villain was just genius. The roles and abilities of every character felt very creative and hilarious, some more overt than others.

The cast is fantastic and seemed to be having an absolute ball playing a variety of super hero/mystery men characters.  Geoffrey Rush is superbly OTT as the evil nemesis of Captain fantastic.  The other mystery men are really hit and miss.  Fans of toilet humour will appreciate the Sphinx and his special ability, and people who like Jeanne Garafalo's style will like her overly sarcastic character.  William H Macy was probably the best as shovel man, he played it so straight faced almost semi serious.  Still while there are plenty of jokes to be had in this film, there are many that miss the mark.

82,Jakealope,Comc Book Super Heroes Are Silly & This is A Great Spoof,6,13 May 2010,"Eleven years ago, we were still taking comic book super hero movies way too seriously, but with the twin onslaught of that Batman and Ironman high budget slick messes and attendant commercial successes and predictable gushings, this movie makes even more sense. Comic book super heroes are silly and juvenile and this move treats them in a satirical but understanding way. This has ensemble cast of good actors playing the most obscure un-heroic un-super sub heroes ever conceived. It is funny and half way intelligent, and some of the super heroes like Pee Wee Herman's Spleen, who can knock out bad guys with precision farts, is funny but not too crude. The heroes all have their quirks & personalities and the dialog and humor is good. We have William Macy playing The Shoveler, a regular not bright laborer by day who fights crime with a silver plated spade at night. Then there is the Blue Raja, played by Hank Azaria who sells high end silverware by day and talks with an English accent as he attempts to subdue criminals by throwing forks and spoons, not knives. Geoffry Rush plays the requisite mad scientist evil bad guy, ""Casanova Frankenstein"", threatening to kill the premier superhero and blow up the world, right on. Go see it, it's a lot of fun. My main complaint is the tackiness of styles, from cars to clothes, that passes for comic book camp, with cheesy styles from the 30's up to the present tossed in that frankly were unsightly and annoying. We had them drive around in some 50s station wagon, the Shoveler's family car by day, chasing Casanova Frankenstein in his stretch limo made out of a 67 Corvette Stingray to the Disco Boys bad gang stuck in the 70s.",Mystery Men
83,Benjamin_Cox,Enthusiasm and ideas but it's sadly not enough - 59%,5,29 March 2005,"There seems to have been a serious amount spent on cheap DVDs lately. Not only do I splash out at Virgin's ""5 for £30"" deal but I also seem to have spent nearly all of my Blockbuster credit on ex-rental DVDs. So many movies to watch in so little time. And still feeling dirty and depressed after viewing ""Die Hard 2"" (which is soon to be exchanged), I felt like a little light relief was needed so I watched something I'd been meaning to watch for some time - ""Mystery Men"". Sadly, the relief was all too light and like ""The League Of Extraordinary Gentlemen"", this is a pleasant enough waste of time but doesn't live up to the killer premise.In far away Champion City, crime has been virtually eliminated by crime-fighting superhero Captain Amazing (Greg Kinnear), meaning that he was little to do but appear in commercials and push autograph hunters aside. Then he has an idea - arrange his arch-nemesis Casanova Frankenstein (Geoffrey Rush) to escape from his asylum and beat him all over again, to boost his fading profile. Unfortunately, Frankenstein is a masterful evil genius and has soon captured Captain Amazing, meaning that nobody is there to save the city from imminent destruction. Nobody except the worst bunch of superhero-wannabes imaginable, from Mr Furious (Ben Stiller) to the Shoveller (William H Macy). Aided by an invisible boy who is only invisible when nobody is looking (Kel Mitchell) to a bowling-ball wielding woman on a quest for revenge (Janeane Garofalo), the team of hopeless losers begin their mission to rescue the real superhero and defeat Casanova once and for all.Like I said, it's a great idea for a film but something is lacking here. Certainly not the enthusiasm from the actors, most of whom are pretty good if not totally believable in their roles. Probably the best of the bunch is Macy, who has that brilliant look of world-weariness as his despairing wife can't understand her husband's determination to be a superhero. Rush and Eddie Izzard (as his disco-dancing accomplice) have little to do but both have such ridiculous accents that it's impossible to take them seriously. Actually, why should any of this be taken seriously? It's as disposable as a plastic cup and it couldn't be a bigger mickey-take if it tried and this is one of the problems. Superhero movies are all the same anyway, in terms of structure, story and finale. And sadly, ""Mystery Men"" sticks doggedly to the formula. It raises a few smirks now and again but this isn't the hilarious film that it might have been.I'm not really a hardcore comic fan but I imagine most readers of ""Spiderman"" or whatever might be pretty offended by this. OK, maybe not as offended if they'd watched ""Daredevil"" but this is one of the most hypocritical movies I've ever seen. Whilst denouncing superhero movies as dumb and clichéd, ""Mystery Men"" pulls back its mask and reveals itself to be a dumb and clichéd superhero movie. This could have been brilliant (as, indeed, could ""LXG"") but it falls apart quicker than Michael Jackson's defence team. For a real superhero movie, watch ""Spiderman 2"" or even ""The Incredibles"" because this is a long way off those heights. Never mind... I also picked, among others, ""X-Men 2"" and I'm willing to bet that film will be much better than this one. This is a terrible waste of a great idea, yet again.",Mystery Men
84,torrascotia,Ahead of its time.,6,12 October 2018,"Looking at some of the reviews on here its clear that this movie did not find the audience it deserved at the time. 
In 1999 many people were simply not quite ready to understand a superhero movie which was based more or less in reality and was a send up of the genre. Anyone expecting a run of the mill superheroes with superpowers movie would be disappointed. However this is a much smarter movie in which we have average guys with alot of heart but zero abilities who try to fight crime with hilariously incompetent results. They are more likely to hurt each other than any criminals. These heroes dont have cool names, cool costumes and don't even have cool pretend powers. Another huge disappointment for the average comic book hero fan as whats the point if they cant do anything we cant?
Watching this movie post Megamind, Deadpool, Watchmen and Kickass this movie makes total sense. What also seems to make sense is that every one of those movies, all seem to have borrowed heavily from Mystery Men.
What you do get is a fantastic cast, laugh out jokes, crazy set pieces, many quotable lines all wrapped up in a fairly family friendly package. Think of this as a live action Megamind or PG version of Kickass. The story is quite straight forward but it does still make fun of the usual comic book tropes in a fresh way.
I would highly recommend this to anyone who enjoyed any of the movies I compared Mystery Men to, you will wonder why you had previously let this one slip by and also just how many of the current crop of ""original"" and ""smarter"" comic book movies have ripped off Mystery Men?

Since it hardly ran in German theatres, I had to wait for the video release. But unfortunately, the film was not as good as I hoped it would be. The main reason might be that the crazy comic cliches are only hinted at, but never really executed. There are these wonderfully silly characters - The Shoveler, Mr.Furious, the Spleen - but they never really get fully into action, neither are their ""super-powers"" really made fun of. There is this scene at the restaurant at the beginning when Shoveler and Blue Raja mock each other about their code names - this is the kind of humor I would have liked to see much more. Superhero cliches are a wonderful stuff to make fun of - sideswipes to real DC and Marvel superheros would have been easy, but unfortunately do not happen.""Mystery Men"" tries too much to be an action flick instead of highlighting the humor part. Simply putting silly characters into a story does not make it funny - the silly characters have to do  more silly things, talk silly, act silly. Instead, the characters take themselves much too serious for guys who fight with shovels and forks. Therefore, this film is a lost chance. A pity.",Mystery Men

The problem: Only ameager amount of comic book readers get it.The closest films comparable to Mystery Men are unfortunately, the Batmanseries, the Mortal Kombat series and Spawn.

I just love the story of wannabe super heroes rejected by the ""real"" super hero
and the commercial advertising machine. But somehow they pull together to create
a very odd, but sweet group of genuine heroes fighting really bad villains.ACTING:
The acting is awesome across the cast, some better than others. While each character
brings its own unique qualities (and story), I think Geoffrey Rush does an outstanding
job as the arch villain.TEMPO:
Some viewers might complaint that it's a bit slow-going at times, but that's because
the characters are actually being developed as the story unfolds. (Wow, character
development ... that's a novel idea.)CINEMATOGRAPHY:
They use a lot of models, and while some are life-like, others are a tad cheesy. Overall,
it's a whole city with some wild buildings, and it's very well done.DIRECTING:
For the one and only feature-length film, the director did an excellent job. The writer's
resume is almost equally as short, but I thought a funny, well-developed story.Overall, this is a bit of an oddball film, but it's not ""Tim Burton"" weird, so maybe that's
why viewers don't rate this higher. If you don't watch this, you're missing out on fun.",Mystery Men
89,wchngliu,"An Interesting Take on The Superhero Concept, Mystery Men Is Different As It Is Original",8,30 June 2007,"Mystery Men is not your average superhero flick, but also it is definitely not on the same lines as Batman, Superman, the X-men, Daredevil and so many other comic book adaptation movies. Whilst they have the main hero(es)battling triumphing over evil in such typical fashion, Mystery Men is the complete flip side to that. In the film, they are on a mission to rescue Captain Fantastic- aka the hugely talented Greg Kinnear- from an evil enemy known as Casanova Frankenstein- aka Geoffery Rush- (great name for a baddie BTW!). The superheroes that make up The Mystery Men are struggling and are of which some of the most inventive-yet amusing ever created. Names include Mr Furious, played by Ben Stiller of where he reminds me of the incredible hulk- personality-wise the fact that he loses his temper and thus as a result, he unleashes his powers against his foes, The Shoveler, played by the underrated and yet impressive William H Macy who takes on villains wearing a mining helmet and brandishing, um, a shovel as his weapon of choice! As well as The Invisible Boy, of whom can only become invisible when nobody is looking(very strange concept indeed!)and The Bowler, who has a bowling ball as her main fighting weapon. Making up the crew are The Spinx and The Blue Raja. The Blue Raja intrigued me a little, considering that at first with the extremely posh London accent, I would've thought the director and Casting Director would've hired a British actor in its place. However, my mind had changed afterwards after seeing a scene where the Raja has a phone call with his mother- and he speaks to her in his real- life American accent, which was very funny! But the character that really got to me was The Spleen and his fart jokes became a little annoying and irksome, the longer the film went on. Nonetheless, they are slightly more interesting than most so-called established superheroes.Before this film came out, I had never heard of, nor familiarised myself with the comics, despite this though where Mystery Men differs and does well, in comparison to those so-called superhero films is that it is very much a parody of and a somewhat smart mickey take on comic book superheroes. Unlike Cyclops, Wolverine and Storm to name, for the exception of Captain Fantastic, Mystery Men's counterparts are still down-to-earth- yet unsuccessful, and of whom carry with them an abundance of wit, charm, silliness and humour. And whilst, the cast is made up of virtually non-A listers, the fact that it has an array of stellar acting talent in the shape of Ben Stiller, William H Macy, Greg Kinnear, Hank Azaria and Geoffery Rush,of whom all provide really good performances as their characters, is impressive still. Plus, they carry the film well without having to succumb to such patronising and overbearing levels of so-called superhero worshipping and conformity in American society and a high level of public expectation being thrusted upon them. The humour is very dry and so unless you are a fan of this type of humour, as well as being a comic book fan, then unfortunately the wise cracks and jokes will not be of your taste and preference.Mystery Men does not attempt to live up to the expectations of films such as Superman, Spider-man, X-Men, nor does it seek to be a rival to those mainstream comic book efforts, rather that it delves deeper into the so- called superhero myth and disseminates and ridicules it by means of questioning a) what it stands for, b)how it is depicted, c) by attacking (not in a harsh way that is) the very conventions and popularisation of superheroes. By means of which i am saying that the likes of the X-Men trilogy, Batman, Fantastic Four etc have become so accepted by the mainstream and in the Hollywood movie business that its initial comic book roots and origins have been stripped away and as a result, its cult factor has deteriorated. Therefore, some of its so called cultural values has been eroded, because of their commercialisation. Or in other words, they have sold out to the mainstream public. Mystery Men, however is a comedic comic book adaptation that is unique, inventive and intriguing that the concept remains original, both to its fans and the comic book fraternity. The dialogue is witty and sharp and the amount of sarcasm is evenly spreaded out within this film, so much so that it doesn't deviate from the script, nor the main plot.Overall, it is a delightful superhero and comic book romp, which as it is a parody, rightfully doesn't take itself too seriously.

What was supposed to be a fun spoof of superhero movies has turned out to be a mess for its stars.  The characters all act like they came fresh out of an old-fashioned comic book, and some of them even have powers that just don't make much sense, powers such as using a bowling ball as a weapon and being able to turn invisible only when no one's watching.  Pretty weak.1 out of 5",Mystery Men
91,rudicantfail,Retro rubbish,5,10 July 2021,"Well, back then we probably thought it was great, but sorry, it is too dated, and not that funny. Humour at times but mostly just plain silly. However, we have seen worse, so it was an OK movie. Retro. Good to watch Tom Waits, did not expect to see him in this sort of film!",Mystery Men
92,Foxbarking,My Favorite Comic Book Movie,10,20 April 2013,"Mystery Men is one of the few movies that I remember being exceptionally excited about. Although I was not familiar with the Flaming Carrot comics, I remember seeing the huge advertising campaign for this movie and became exceptionally curious.My sister and I went to see this when it was released and I have to admit it is still one of my favorite cinematic experiences ever. I actually expected the Mystery Men to rescue Captain Amazing and let him save the day. Looking back, I realize how terrible that would have been. Captain Amazing was a total ass and solely responsible for every death in the movie. Rather than go such an off route, we got to see a group of people who may not be talented, but have heart and soul unlike any other super heroes. . As corny as it is, this movie reminded me a lot of the Christopher Reeve Superman movies. There was an expected corniness about it, but you still find yourself routing for it.The performances are all amazing. This is William H. Macy's movie. He took the Shoveler from an unsure man lacking direction and made him into the leader of this team. He seems to lack the ability to see the obvious, being at first surprised at the idea of teamwork and then assuming incorrectly that the Sphinx would be a good leader. He becomes the leader when he realizes that they have to be heroes not for themselves, but to protect the people they love and the people they have never met. Ben Stiller, the most hated actor I have ever watched, was actually fun to watch as Mr. Furious. I don't think Geoffrey Rush has ever given a bad performance.I'll never understand why this movie bombed like it did. I love it and will remember it forever.",Mystery Men
93,WilsonLau,"Mystery Solved, this movie stunk!",1,26 January 2000,"There are those movies that are so bad that they're funny and you can kinda laugh it off but you can't even do that with this one. This movie was just pathetic. I'd like to say something nice about it but there really is not aspect of this movie that didn't stink. The acting was bad, costumes, characters, story, even the goofy names were just plain bad and created with little or no thought process. If the goal in this world was to do your worst then the film makers of this movie gets A+++++. I think that if you see this at the bottom of a bargain bin somewhere that that is where it belongs.... keep it there for everyone's sake!! Thank you for reading.",Mystery Men
94,gb901,Great film - much underrated,8,26 October 2019,Ahead of its time considering the plethora of superhero films today that are deadly earnest and take themselves far too seriously.IMO mystery men is book very clever and funny.,Mystery Men
95,RestlessRust,"Enjoyable, but with Glaring Omissions",7,5 March 2001,"With such an amusing premise, it's surprising (and somewhat disappointing) that Mystery Men isn't funnier.  While there are plenty of humorous moments, it is unlikely that this movie will elicit more than a few chuckles from most viewers.  So on the comedy scale, MM earns an ""almost"" score of 7.So what about the adventure aspect?  I saw this movie on DVD, which had the option of watching deleted scenes separately from the movie.  While watching the film, there were times that I thought things happened with too little explanation or setup.  Then I watched the deleted scenes and found the explanations I was looking for.  (For example, the Shoveler tells his wife he will give up crime fighting, but in his next scene, he is standing beside his comrades, ready to save the day.  One of the deleted scenes shows Mr. Furious convincing him to stay in the gang.  Why was this scene left out?) There's plenty of adventure, but with such questions popping up frequently, on this scale MM earns another ""almost"" score of 7.Then there's the drama aspect.  It's hard not to empathize with these guys as they try to pursue what they believe is their destiny even though their abilities are mediocre.  But it would have helped if we had been given some information on their backgrounds.  How did they discover their powers?  How did they meet?  What keeps them going since they experience frequent failures?  Again, with such persistent unanswered questions, MM only earns an ""almost"" score of 7.So the overall rating of MM is 7.  It's an average movie, and I can't help wishing someone with a grander vision would have stepped in and punched up the script.  This movie could have been the most poignant look at super heroes since the Lois & Clark TV series.  Instead, it's just a fun little movie.",Mystery Men
96,lizziebeth-1,"We must stop making live-action versions of comics= LAME! 2.5/10. SPOILERS; but nothing that's a surprise, I assure you...",2,20 October 2002,"I never want to see another live-action comic again! I'm never again going to waste my time, brain, emotions, senses, OR money ON EVEN A FREE VIDEO of one. CGI-maybe. If a comicbook hero is to be brought to the big screen, it should be presented as clearly comicbook, instead of trying to suffer real-world limitation. The mysticism of a comic is immediately undermined by live-action alone, let alone by a genre-mocking deconstruction! All comics challenge their audiences with E*N*O*R*M*O*U*S suspension of disbelief requirements; but the Mystery Men characters hinge on exposing (deconstructing) the likely banality behind superhero myths. It is what this comic originally became famous for. Unfortunately Mystery Men breaks its own genre-mocking rule when the characters do end up having some magical powers after all.  It errs on the side of mysticism, and falls on its own sword. The film's ending tries to go back to mocking the genre, but by then it's too late; we've suffered the lie (Elwood Blues would say `it wasn't lies; it was bullsh!t') for 2hrs. We know we're being ripped off. I don't call that entertainment.Because the Mystery Men cannot compartmentalize their `real-world' vs superhero personalities, we are plunged into an entire worldful of caricature `superheroes', each more pathetic than the last, with the exception of Capt. Amazing (Greg Kinnear) , who instead is a spin-doctoring, shallow celebrity now. So the Mystery Men HAVE to be so hopeless and un-heroic that any mother with a toddler in a supermarket would out-hero them any day. I do realize that's supposed to be part of their `charm', but their pointedly dumbed-down inadequacies as people are too pointed. Obviously, these imbecilic superheroes get depressed over their failures, but they don't even have enough sense to practice; so they actually deserve to fail! Consequently, their triumph is FALSE in the light of who they still are: the Mystery Men, and by association their audience, are all just a pathetic bunch of weirdos. I cite Kevin Smith's insightful/ sarcastic expose of comicbook patrons in the Bluntman+Chronic scenes of the fabulous Chasing Amy (1997). You know:- adolescent males.Take the very obvious clues left by the `super-powers' of the gang (I cannot BELIEVE other reviewers haven't taken to task this concept): Mr Furious is only in touch with ONE emotion; he's a petulant imbecile who thinks he should lead the group because otherwise he gets angry. Ah, what is he: TWO? Maybe! He completely lacks any skills/talents, direction or wisdom way beyond the point of funny. He even has a crisis of conscience when the one girl whom he's asked out suggests he try reacquainting himself with his own name (she's somewhat smarter). The other adolescent dead giveaway is the talent of The Spleen (PeeWee Herman) for galeforce flatulence, plus his wildly overdone pimples and lithp. This is shallow, adolescent toilet humour. Moreover, the pimples and lisp look and sound really fake on such a mature-aged actor. We're embarrassed for the filmmakers, and note that the characters of Mystery Men are excessively DUMBED-DOWN. What for? Aren't we all way too experienced moviegoers to find that acceptable/entertaining? There are 5-yr olds more sophisticated (I KNOW one)!Most of these characters are overgrown children/hopeless loners, and they suck accordingly. I only like Baby Bowler (Janeane Garofalo) who, together with Mr Invisible (Kel Mitchell), are seriously verging on mental illness; but at least her asides to her bowling ball (her dad) sometimes raise a smile. She and her ball garner the movie a +2.0 rating (her name `Baby Bowler' swings, whereas `The Spleen' is just INCOMPREHENSIBLE-farts have nothing to do with spleens).Only William H Macy's `Shoveller' ever shows the slightest gumption or leadership, but even he craves superhero adulation, although he's a married man and father. Other supporting actors, such as the usually feisty Jenifer Lewis playing his wife, and Geoffrey Rush's hammy `Casanova Frankenstein', are essentially wasted. Shame.The challenge of this movie was always how to tart up a poor concept. The one ethically redeeming feature is that Mystery Men affirms everyone's right to be heard/win on occasion, including the mentally ill, the alienated, and the stupid. This gets the movie +4.5 ratings-points. But of course it's taken too far, into the realms of male ego-aggrandizement, which sets them back a  -9.0...I guess I can award Mystery Men a +1.0 for its gentility a +1.0 for its generous use of disco (and the inclusion of  `A Fifth of Beethoven' on the soundtrack).The final confrontation scene is incomprehensible and overripe with special f/x, and consequently unaffecting. Other reviewers have also complained about the inappropriateness of the spf/x, and I agree, it undermines their genre-mocking cred: are the Mystery Men caricatures, or are they actual superheroes? Those options are mutually exclusive. This comic in particular, more so than any other, tries to have it both ways. Audiences notice that sort of thing, even if only subconsciously, and THAT'S WHY Mystery Men fails as a movie, as a plot, as a concept.Ethically too, it seems to celebrate the male ego's need to be a winner, no matter how stupid you are. See? Dumbed down and shallow, designed for male adolescents. No-one who is capable of more should ever be an apologist for this drivel. Ha, and for all that, the movie is too long; almost 2hrs. Isn't that ridiculous?The movie's oft-quoted style, delivered mainly with one-liners (`...apparently I'm hangin' out with Lazy Boy and... and.. The Recliner!'; `...with the mighty hammer of Not Bickering'; and `Spleen, there isn't enough beer in the world') simply doesn't excuse the movie's much more profound inadequacies. Overall a weak effort-poor concept, somewhat elevated by repartee. ...Oh, let me give it another +3.0 for the quips. But it's pointless to call Mystery Men `entertainment', because despite its still mostly annoying one-liners, Mystery Men is an embarrassing, adolescent inadequacy that bullsh!ts its audience. Where's the entertainment in that?",Mystery Men
97,Squrpleboy,An Incredible Waste Of Talent,2,11 December 2002,"I laughed once during the entire movie, and it was the kind oflaugh that consists of a short breach of air from the nose, barelyaudible and barely worthwhile mentioning.  I only do so to leteveryone know that I couldn't even crack a smile watching MysteryMen; because it is NOT FUNNY!  It's not that it was poorly made, with sub-standard cinematographyor direction, terrible acting, lack-luster special effects, or even badediting.  And it's obvious that the movie cost a lot of money toproduce.  The film can even boast a sizeable & top-notch group ofcomedic and dramatic talents forming the cast of otherwise greatactors, including Geoffrey Rush, William H. Macy, Greg Kinnear,Hank Azaria, Ben Stiller, Janeane Garofalo, Paul Reubens, TomWaits, Eddie Izzard, Lena Olin, Ricky Jay and Claire Forlani; allwonderful actors in previous and subsequent projects. (Stand- outs this time are limited to Tom Waits & Greg Kinnear (both inminimal roles), and Paul Reubens' voice as The Spleen.)  Theproblem with this picture lies in the fact that IT HAS NO STORY!!! The plot is so bad it makes any episode of the old Batman TVshow look like Hamlet!  I don't know how well this film adaptation of the comic book standsup to its source material, but it did absolutely nothing to sell me oneither one.  I CLEARLY understand that this was a ""parody"" ofsuper-hero comics, but a parody usually implies that somehumour is involved at some point (or at least humour thatsomeone that doesn't still wear Superman Underoos at age 38can appreciate).  If you've seen The Tick, Batman (1960's TV), aparody from Mad or Cracked Magazine, or even the cartoony fun ofartist Fred Hembeck, you've seen the super-hero genre lampooned at its best.  If you've seen Mystery Men, you probablyare just wondering ""WHY?!!!""  2/10.  One viewing was too much; too much of not a Hell of a lot!",Mystery Men
98,great_sphinx_42,Clearance-Rack Superheros,5,11 March 2001,"I was rather befuddled after watching 'Mystery Men'. It should have been great, but just wasn't. There was a great cast, but the whole thing seemed to lack coherence. It's greatest gag is this cool premise: in a world where superheros really exist, of course everyone would want- and *try*- to be one. The superhero profession would be corrupted by money and folks would run out of cool hooks. Hence, Captain Amazing is covered with corporate logos and the tryouts are populated by such absurd and hilarious entities as the PMS Avenger (who only works 4 days a month) and The Waffler (who carries a big jug of syrup). Of course, not all of them will actually have any powers, so we have folks like Mr. Furious, whose power is getting really mad. Hey, I could be a superhero, too! Hell breaks loose when Cassanova Frankenstein kidnaps Captain Amazing. But that's not a bad thing, because of course our heros are now given a chance to actually save the day. 'Mystery Men' is not a particularly bad movie. It's fairly entertaining, and worth a watch on the video back rack or TV. Pras and Eddie Izzard are fun as the Tonys, but ever-irritating non-actress Claire Forlani shows up as Monica the Waitress. Too bad she didn't try to use that as her superhero hook. She could have flown around taking revenge on all tip-stiffers.",Mystery Men

Obviously it's not for everyone, as is attested to by the numerous dismissive comments it's received.

100,ToldYaSo,Hooray for the underdog as evil is thwarted by unlikely not-so-superheroes,9,17 August 1999,"The ""Mystery Men"" are a ragtag bunch of semi-super-powered misfits that make unlikely guardians of ""Champion City"", but it's how hard they try to be crime fighters that counts, and what wins us over.In this ode to the losers, underdogs and wanna-bes of the world, we find hilarity and ingenuity as spawned from ""Dark Horse"" comic books. In all fairness, I've never actually read one of the comic books that inspired this film, but I don't think that matters; the story unfolds just like a comic book would. Bright colours and busy backdrops throughout the film make it feel as though cartoon bubbles should be popping out of everyone's mouths.We are treated to some utter silliness right from the get go, and our ""heroes"" feel so familiar to us in a way that almost defies understanding. But I think it's because unlike most of the superheroes that we've come to know and revere, these guys make the same kind of boneheaded blunders that we all do on a regular basis. They look and act like knobs and basically crime fighting is their hobby. It makes them seem all the more real despite the ridiculous nature of their powers and/or trademarks.It's the villains that are truly ridiculous and harder to relate to. From disco loving pimp-like thugs to corporate big-wig down-sizers to fraternity boys, they all serve as amusing adversaries but without too much focus on them as most of the fun comes from learning the history of each of the ""Mystery Men"" and their dysfunctional roles in society.There are many very funny moments that are almost completely contextual which means the film gets better and better as it goes along. But I guess you have to be in the right mood for this kind of film and just go with it. I can see how someone might see it as stupid or silly, but I can safely say that they've put a lot of thought and creativity into this venture, and I found myself wishing it was longer even after almost two hours.Another factor of this film to be commended on is it's intentional downplay of lethal force. For the most part, the violence is physical and the heroes weapons are not instruments of death.My hope is that Universal will choose to offer supplementary bonus material on the imminent DVD release of this film, as they have with their other excellent ""Collector's Editions"" that feature great behind the scenes moments and interviews. I'm sure there's plenty of interesting background on a film like this one.",Mystery Men

The scene were the Blue Raja sits on the fork and the skunk humping The Spleen's leg are two prime examples.

I hand-constructed a back-mounted shovel holster for my Shoveler Halloween costume one year and it remains my favorite costume ever.Garafolo is brilliant as the punchy daughter of a bowling legend with his head in a lucite ball in her bag. Pee Wee Herman is disgusting as the 'pull my finger' fart man.The writing is hilarious, and the comic genius assembled for this sleeper hit deliver their material with gusto.

Ben Stiller (one of my faves after watching ""Meet the Parents"") was hillarious and his supporting team were funny and unique, they even had a chick, played by one of my ultimate faves, Janeane Garofalo.I loved how the popular superhero endorsed popular products and was about as real as a Ken Doll compared to the band of wanna-be, more lovable outcasts.

108,shrine-2,Underdogs,8,13 March 2000,"I've been waiting for a superhero movie like this for a long time.  ""Mystery Men"" takes its place among the classic comic-strip spoofs on TV like ""Batman"" and ""Captain Nice"" and cartoons like ""Underdog"" and ""Super Chicken.""  The same spirit lives in all of them:  the comic tongue-in-cheek tone; the courage to aim for the heroic in life at the risk of looking ridiculous; the not-so-sure-footed way that these characters manage to prevail over their adversaries.  It's the misfired spark of nobility igniting in the weak and the ordinary, and it's wonderful to see it glow so high and bright here.""Mystery Men"" opens on a party at a nursing home.  I wish Kinka Usher had had the sense to give more energy and life to the old people in the scene.  As it is, it looks like something George Romero might have devised.  We need to get the feeling that these old people are as sharp as everyone else, or it feels patronizing.  By the time the Red Eyes crash the festivities, you half expect Tom Waits who plays a weapons inventor with a penchant for ladies in their eighties to stand up and shout:  ""Just what this party needs--a little excitement!""  If writer Neil Cuthbert had any sense, he would have had Waits mixing it up with the intruders and egging on the partiers to do the same.  It would have made for a rousing beginning, and a better introduction of the troublesome trio: the Shoveler (William Macy); the Blue Raja (Hank Azaria); and Mr. Furious (Ben Stiller), who seem to come out of nowhere to save the day. There are many other problems to ""Mystery Men"" than I care to go into; among them that the villain Casanova Frankenstein needs to have as cultivated a sense of the absurd as the rest of the people in this movie, and he doesn't.  Geoffrey Rush is the wrong actor for the part; he needs to be way over the top to make the conflict between good and evil a galvanic one.  And Rush has never exhibited a talent for the outre.  You hope for the ripe theatrics of a John Lithgow in ""The Adventures of Buckaroo Banzai"" or the dry, debonair diffidence of a Paul Freeman in ""Raiders of the Lost Ark.""  Instead what we get is pastiche; something half-baked and not fully realized.There are too many ideas running through ""Mystery Men"" for anyone to tie them neatly together, and that may be its deepest problem.  But whatever kind of a mess it is is the kind of mess I love.  Ben Stiller has always seemed to be slumming in the roles he takes.  This one is no exception, but he goes at it with such conviction that you come away feeling that he'd learned something about comedy growing up in a household run by Jerry Stiller and Anne Meara.  His Roy is related to all the put-upon, overly sensitive, chronically defensive types that Woody Allen made popular.  And whether it's wheedling his way into the affections of the waitress at his favorite hangout (the sleek Claire Forslani), or questioning the wisdom of a fellow superhero (Wes Studi as the Sphinx), or giving a new member of their ""elite"" group (Jeaneane Garofalo in what are possibly her funniest moments on screen) a hard time, he makes it always fun to watch.  I couldn't exactly say that about him in ""There's Something About Mary.""Jeaneane Garofalo proves with this performance that she should have been the star of ""One True Thing,"" not Renee Zellweger.  I don't think I have ever seen funnier exchanges between a daughter and father (okay, so he's dead and his skull is in a bowling ball, so sue me) in the movies.  And the funny part about this role is that it feels like a screwball reprise of Emily Watson's spellbinding talks with God in ""Breaking the Waves.""  And in this version, the girl doesn't die, and bells don't ring in your head.William H. Macy does something very difficult; he makes stolid magnetic.  You understand right away what's attracted Jenifer Lewis' Lucille to Eddie.  You can also understand her exasperation.  The barbecue alone would be enough to drive me over the edge, but when Eddie's adorable, half-breed son looks up at his father and says ""I believe in you, Daddy."" to which Lucille sighs and exclaims, ""Roland, don't encourage your father,"" you feel like standing and hailing Neil Cuthbert as a first-rate wit. With Hank Azaria (whose only moment of note in film up to this point was his bare behind in ""The Birdcage"") and Louise Lasser (Has it been more than two decades since we first took note of her in ""Bananas"" and ""Mary Hartman, Mary Hartman?"") as son and mother who share a fondness for silverware; Greg Kinnear as Captain Amazing and Ricky Jay as his publicist; Kel Mitchell as ""Invisible Boy""; Paul Reubens as ""The Spleen;"" and Lena Olin who, if she didn't have the few lines in this movie that she has, would seem to be visiting the set.",Mystery Men

Good writing probably could have saved the movie but nobody bothered. There is exactly one hilarious scene in the middle of the movie where the heroes attack (really more like harass)the villain in his limo. This I could watch over and over.

I'd avoided it in the cinema, but after several people told me it was really good I bought the DVD and was glad that I did.I just love the whole concept of bad superheros, and the way it makes fun of the genre without destroying its own reality, and in particular the 'How can he be Captain Amazing?

Despite their best efforts everything always seems to go wrong and they are constantly living in the shadow of the city's favorite hero Captain Amazing. When Amazing is captured by a recently released super-villain it is their chance to prove to everyone, including themselves, how important they really are.I'll start by saying that Mystery Men is absolutely hilarious and one of most clever and subtle comedies ever made. All at once the Mystery Men are spoofing super hero conventions while being heroes themselves. Ben Stiller gives the best performance of his career as Mr. Furious; whose failed puns and inability to use his power to any affect are the two funniest running gags in the film. Backing up Ben Stiller is an superb ensemble cast almost all of whom give amazing performances that are at once resonant and hilarious. In addition to Ben Stiller; William H Macy, Hank Azaria and Greg Kinnear are high points.I also want to point out that Mystery Men isn't just a good comedy, it's one of the best movies about super heroes ever made. Never have super heroes been portrayed in this realistic light. These are super heroes that live with their mothers, have low self esteem, and can't talk to women. This is an underdog story in the truest sense of the word and you can't help but root for them because they're like real people. Much like Watchmen reinvented super heroes in the 80's as cruel and sometimes impotent lunatics, Mystery Men reinvents them as well meaning losers.Don't let the critics or the paltry 5.9 IMDb rating fool you this is one of a kind. I highly recommend this to everyone and I implore you to not this let cinematic gem slip through the cracks. People who don't appreciate good movies....Make Me Furious!",Mystery Men

And they're remembered even now in certain quarters. This film is brilliant because it not only provides an insurmountable amount of laughs and fun concepts, it also show how people as a whole truly can be. This is said because the movie showed through examples of goofy pseudo-superheroes that people are who they are and just have to work that to their advantages. Mushy sentiment aside, the film starts off by showing a trio of superheroes in Champion City (an overt, if functioning title for a city) trying to fight but losing. With yet another defeat tallied up and a substantially important city personage missing, the three superheroes decide to recruit some newer members to their fold and fight off the fiend who started this mess. As luck would have it, it all seems to go awry, until they enlist the help of a big-time superhero as well as a deranged scientist (played to the hilt by the great Tom Waits) who offers them weapons. It then remains on our newfound heroes to fight the villain and save more than the city.

One hero that the film could have done without in this sporadically funny comedy is Paul Reubens as the repulsive Spleen. He is absolutely obnoxious, not only in concept, but just as much in an untalented, unfunny performance by the former Pee-Wee.

121,chicklet-2,not bad,6,7 August 1999,"It wasn't bad.  This turned out to be a clever spoof of just about every comic book movie that has ever been made beginning with Superman and ending with The Avengers.  The plot was basically the same as every other movie like this one but there were a few interesting and at times hilarious twists.  The major reason to see this movie is its incredible cast.  The two Oscar nominees, Geoffrey Rush and Greg Kinnear, turn in great supporting performances as Cassanova Frankenstein, the evil villain, and Captain Amazing, the over-endorsed superhero of Champion City, respectively.  Even in a rather ridiculous film like this one, Rush manages to shine.  Then we have the Mystery Men themselves, a rag tag group of wannabe heroes who set out to save Captain Amazing and Champion City from the clutches of Cassanova Frankenstein.  Heading them up is the unimpressive Ben Stiller as Mr. Furious.  He wasn't funny, and he didn't even have a real super power.  He was just annoying. Next is Hank Azaria as the Blue Raja.  Now here was spoofing at its best.  The Raja's talent is hurling his mother's cutlery while speaking in a British accent.  Add the fact that Hank Azaria himself can be like a living cartoon and you just have to smile.  Then there's William H. Macy, an every may, good husband, good father, but with a special talent; he shovels very well, hence his name, the Shoveler.  Paul Reubens plays Pee Wee Herman with and awful lisp and a deadly flatulence problem, but he's still hilarious.  I still don't know who Invisible Boy was played by or why he was in this movie so I'll move on.  Last, but certainly not least there is the Bowler played by Janeane Garofalo.  I never cease to get a kick out of Janeane Garofalo and this movie is no exception.  Her dry humor and rapier wit invigorate this movie just when you think it isn't going to be any good... even if her character talks to her dead father whose skull she keeps in her bowling ball.  Garofalo even manages to make something that dumb funny.  It was over-long and overblown, but it's better than any of the other action films you'll see coming from the summer of 99. So see it.

The only really good comic energy comes from Ben Stiller, as Mr. Furious, and Janeane Garofalo, as The Bowler.

They are different, and striking.  There is an excellent use of color, and everything has something of a comic book quality.  The acting is also very good.

125,on_the_can,Worth a second watch,7,3 April 2011,"So in the metropolis known as Champion city one hero stands up to evildoers, putting a triumphant end to criminal activity while the population swoons at his every act. His name is Captain Amazing(Greg Kinear)...but he's not alone. On the sidelines are Mr. Furious, The Shoveler and The Blue Raja. 3 misfit superheroes played by Ben Stiller, William H. Macy and Hank Azaria. They try their damnedest to follow Captain Amazing's example and help in all the crime fighting. But when Captain Amazing is captured by the villain Casanova Frankenstein(Geoffrey Rush) it's up to the three of them to find and rescue him, recruiting help along the way, rounding out their team with The Bowler(Janeane Garofalo), The Spleen(Paul Reubens), Invisible Boy(Kel Mitchell), and the Sphinx(Wes Studi).This seemed like a hysterical premise for a movie and I was stoked back in 1999 to see it. As I recall I liked it but was maybe a little let down given my expectations. Apparently though I was alone in even that amount of praise. I remember at the time this movie getting a lot of flak, I had a couple of friends that out and out hated it. Maybe it was just unrealistic expectations from everybody given the film's stellar cast. Maybe the fact that it takes so many visual cue's from the Batman franchise(Burton and Schumacher alike), when people still had a bad taste in their mouth from 'Batman & Robin.' Maybe it's because superhero movies at that time were few and far between, so the references were just flying over people's heads...maybe if it had been released just a few years later things would've been different. Or maybe...just maybe it wasn't everyone's cup of tea. But it's my understanding that this film is finally starting to develop something of a cult following and I can see why.I just watched this movie again, more than ten years later and I loved every minute of it. What many might have considered to be dumb in it's original run is actually a very clever commentary on superhero conventions. Out characters are gifted with ridiculous powers and skills that in no way should amount to any kind of heroics, and yet somehow they do...an extreme take on the superheros we're actually meant to take seriously. They poke fun at secret identities and costumes...these guys are just as concerned with allying their super persona with coherent themed branding so they can be recognizable to potential fans.The movie is a parody on a genre that hadn't quite gotten its footing in the mainstream yet, and I'm sure that was its real downfall. Quite frankly with the A-list cast it should've been more financially successful regardless of the script, I just don't think many people quite knew what to make of it. If you were one of the many who was disappointed or in some way put off by this film back '99 I would recommend giving it a second shot. I never really hated it in the first place but my rating has definitely gone up and I've discovered a whole new appreciation for it. Beyond the plot which I've focused on in this review it is also quite well acted and directed and has some really stellar visuals in it...quite a feat of art direction as a matter of fact.",Mystery Men

The characters are so unusually weird (in a good way) that you can't help but enjoy them. The movie is so unpredictable and random that you have to watch it until the end and the originality of it only makes it more enjoyable. It's filled with so many quotable lines that will leave you in tears and it's jokes hit their mark 90% of the time.Geoffrey Rush as Casanova Frankenstein (an awesome name) is the coolest character, with his absurd accent and strange lifestyle. When he hosts the party with all of the appropriately-named gangs, the results are priceless. Mr. Furious, The Shoveler, and The Blue Raja (who has no blue in his costume, but claims ""if you know your history, it makes perfect sense!"") are excellent and Stiller, Macy, and Azaria have great chemistry. I love The Shoveler's line ""God gave me a gift. I shovel well."" Tom Waits as Dr. Heller is fantastic. He's the perfect eccentric scientist-type guy. The Sphinx is OK, you don't really need him, but he's fun (there's a scene with a watermelon that's a keeper). Kel Mitchell and Paul Rubens as The Invisible Boy and The Spleen are great, especially Ruben's slurring accent (""Schup? I'm the Schpleen""). And even though I don't like Janeane Garofalo and I hate Greg Kinnear, they both were great in here too. Sarcasm and condescension at its best! The special effects are decent for the movie's modest budget. The effects look very cartoony and colorful, but that's how they should look in this kind of movie. Heller's non-lethal weapons are a really cool idea, especially the Canned Tornado. ""Totally Non-Lethal, But Totally Effective!"" The funniest scene in the entire movie is the superhero tryouts. I laughed so hard that I had to rewind it twice to see it in its entirety. Keep an eye out for The Waffler, played by Dane Cook, and The PMS Avenger.Now I know all this probably seems very stupid and not very funny, but trust me, once you see the movie, you will understand what I'm rambling on about. You'll enjoy it more if you like random humor and absurdity, but if you like superhero movies and / or action movies, you should definitely check this out. You can buy it for around $10 bucks.

129,Stroheim-3,Terrific Cast Can't Quite Pull it Off,6,7 August 1999,"Before I get to the actual film, let me just set up my mind-frame.  Last weekend I watched the FX channel's marathon of the Ben Stiller Show; it was absolutely hilarious.  The comic genious of both Ben Stiller and Janine Garafolo was as apparent as the sun in the sky.  Afterwards, I couldn't wait to see Mystery Men; I couldn't wait to see these great comedians in a satirical superhero movie.  Well I saw it last night, and I must say I was disappointed. 
Don't get me wrong, the cast was terrific.  Geoffrey Rush was great as Cassanova Frankenstein, the film's icy villain.  The Shoveler (played almost seriously by the great William H. Macy) stood as a stark contrast to the child-like Spleen (the former Pee-wee Herman, Paul Reubens) and Kel Mitchell's Invisible Boy (who can only become invisible when nobody is looking).  Janine Garafolo played her usual character (which has not yet worn thin), and Ben Stiller really shined through as Mr. Furious the angry leader who is as cynical as we would be in that particular world.  Let's not forget Hank Azaria who sounds a great deal like James Mason in Kubrick's Lolita.  Anyway, a lot of jokes (and I'll get back to the jokes later) were situated within the audiences' knowledge of comic books and comic book movies.  For example, Captain Amazing's (Greg Kinnear) alter ego, Lance, simply wears a suit and glasses a la Clark Kent, and no one seems to really notice (except Mr. Furious but nobody else believes it).The movie itself looked like Joel Schumaker's wet dream.  It was a living comic book  with a set right out of Batman and Robin.  Unlike Batman and Robin though, this movie was in on the joke just as Army of Darkness was. 
But I digress... The director used a great deal of weird angle shots from weird positions just as artists use in comic books - overhead shots, ultra low angle shots, etc.  It worked in this film because it was supposed to be a moving comic book.  The shots were necessary.  If the film took itself seriously, the shots would be extraneous and thus, stupid.Here's where the film fell apart: it was boring.  I don't mean it was boring all the way through, but there were a good deal of sections that I just felt like leaving.  The first of these was the first scene where Mr. Furious, The Shoveler, and the Blue Raja were in the diner.  It was too long.  The bickering between the Mystery Men also lasted too long, as did their training with the Sphynx.  They could have cut a good twenty minutes off of the running time.Back to the jokes.  Some (and I do stress some) of the jokes were really funny.  Some got a good chuckle.  Most of them were not at all funny.  I understand that a lot of jokes in comic books are not funny, but movies, no matter how hard you try, are not comic books.  They should have made the movie funny.  They needed good jokes instead of the supposed-to-be-cheezy one liners of ""serious"" superhero movies.  THis movie is a parody - they should have stretched it to the limits to make it truly hilarious.  The bottom line - the movie falls apart because of the script, and it is a serious detriment to the rest of the film.",Mystery Men
130,guasco-2,Ahead if it's time,7,28 April 2021,"Before The Boys, Watchmen (film), One Punch Man, and many others...was this film, the first true satire/critique of the superhero icon.This is a prime example of a film that was clearly ahead of its time. Back in 1999 the superhero genre of films was in its infancy. So much so that the mere concept of a big budget superhero film being made was laughable. It was box office suicide. Then comes this film which instead of spoofing comic books (what audiences expected), it gave us our first true critique of idlic heroes. Captain Amazing/Lance (Superman/Clark Kent) is not noble at all. He's actually a slimy mogul who fights crime for fame and money. He's just as guilty for the atrocities that befall Champion City as Casanova Frankenstein since it was HIM who let him out, merely for a good publicity. The film dares to make Superman/Batman a villain. Perhaps the people in power are not as noble as they publicize themselves to be. Sadly, only one buffoon seems to notice, Mr. Furious. He's our surrogate of sorts throughout the film. He rolls his eyes at captain amazing just as we do. He's not fooled by his charisma and neither should we be.Mystery Men is a somewhat corny and yet sometimes funny film. It's a mixed bag on the humor dept.

134,fineanimal,A great film killed by its own trailers,9,29 July 2002,"The marketing campaign for Mystery Men must surely rank among Hollywood's greatest tragedies because it failed to give viewers the slightest hint of the rule-breaking irreverence that makes this film so extraordinary. Not since ""The Simpsons"" have so many incompetent, mediocre characters been made to appear so heroic.A one line description of the plot--a group of untalented super-hero wannabees struggle to save a real superhero and their city--sounds like a recipe for a disastrous film. And it might have been disastrous if the actors had not played their comic roles with such dead-pan sincerity. This film truly does seem dedicated to the average, obscure people among us who doggedly pursue their dreams against all obstacles--including their own innate lack of talent or skill.Mystery Men is extraordinary for a variety of reasons:
1. Setting/atmosphere. The setting for Mystery Men is a parody of Tim Burton's vision of Batman's Gotham City. Rather limited in scope (some sets are obviously reused), but effective at creating and maintaining the ""alter earth"" comic-book feel of this movie. The sheer darkness of sparsely-populated megalopolis Champion City makes you wonder why any truly benevolent superhero would even want to save it. But if you look closely, the set is filled with brutal social satire ala Paul Verhoeven's ""Total Recall"" and ""Starship Troopers"".2. Characterization/Casting. Although Mystery Men does not develop characters as well as it should (particularly the villains), it does feature some of the most unique and hilarious characters you'll find on film. Here is a perfect example of how important casting is when turning a script into a film. Who else but Ben Stiller could be so sincerely oblivious as Mr. Furious? Who else but William H. Macy could wield a shovel with such dignity? The best comedy ensemble cast since ""A Fish Called Wanda"" and ""Ruthless People"".3. Inside Jokes. Mystery Men is filled with inside jokes, and this may or may not make the film inaccessible to some. But if somehow manage to catch the obscure references to William Shatner, you will likely be rewarded with one good, healthy belly laugh after another throughout the film.4. Dialog. The dialog here is the most consistently entertaining I've heard since ""Guys & Dolls,"" made even better by the sheer variety of characters interacting, rather than relying on just one style of elocution. Few films offer so many hilarious sound bites and one-liners.5. Taste. There is really no coherent swearing, gore, or overt sexual references in Mystery Men. Indeed, the lack of filth in this film makes it more fun, if only because of the suspense it creates while we wait to hear the first ""bad word"" that we've come to expect from Hollywood. The most foul thing about this film is The Spleen's flatulence, and even that is presented in good taste.6. Rule-breaking. You gotta love films that break rules--you can almost smell the smoke from the filmmakers' battles with studio executives here. In addition to taking on William Shatner and allowing a major character to check out early, the film pokes fun at everything--including itself--it's almost like watching Mystery Science 3000 heckle an MST3K epiosode.Unfortunately, like the similarly brilliant comedy ""Dogma,"" Mystery Men suffers from a tedious, action-oriented ending that makes one feel the comedy ends quite some time before the film itself does. This is no excuse for missing the first hour and a half of this hilarious film, however. It's still quite satisfying to the very end.",Mystery Men

136,bkam,Occasionally entertaining but unsatisfying,5,27 October 2003,"Mystery Men is a strange amalgam of elements that left me wondering what type of movie I had just sat through.  On the one hand, it tries to be a slapstick comedy, on the other a satire of hero-villain stereotypes, yet it never really succeeds in doing anything.  The comedy present is mostly in the form of humorous one-liners, while many scenes appear serious in an attempt at irony that is quite confusing.  I can only take the action to be a try at humorous parody of the typical super-hero fare, yet it succeeded mainly in being awkward.  The plot was perfectly abysmal, the score uninteresting, and thus the film was overall fairly un-engaging.  The acting was good, especially considering the bizarre characters and lines in the film, but it wasn't quite enough to overcome the uneasiness created by so many other parts of the movie.  Also, some very bad acting (especially between Ben Stiller and the waitress) detracted from the strange but somewhat laudable performances throughout the remainder.  The cinematography was decent, and to its credit the movie was effective in creating a very unique ambience; unfortunately, the interesting environment was used for the most part to alienate the viewer, leaving one trying to figure out what's important in the film.  I must make the disclaimer that I am almost entirely unfamiliar with most superhero movies (or comic books, etc), so perhaps the failure in comprehension was my fault and not the movie's.  Overall, original idea, good setting, reasonable acting, and I laughed a few times; on the other hand, none of that saves it from the overwhelming sense of unjustifiable weirdness (and normally I like weird movies).

Recommendation to its filmmakers: make the lead villain more dastardly and remove ""spleen man"" altogether. Positive notes: the different styles of the gangs (my favorite being the frat boys) and the line ""We're on a blind date with destiny and it looks like she' ordering the lobster""",Mystery Men
142,saraarts,"Haven't laughed this hard at a movie in 10 years, at least",10,9 August 1999,"This movie is wonderful!  There is not a single type of joke that the makers of this film avoided; it's all there -- physical, mental, wordplay, slapstick, erudition, vulgarity -- costume jokes, word jokes, makeup jokes, posture jokes, accent jokes, set jokes, history jokes, science jokes, culture jokes, scatological jokes, even silverware jokes -- and it all works.  I haven't laughed this hard at a movie since the first time I saw Ghostbusters.The production design is magnificent.  Combined physical and computer generated sets and scenery provide the thrill of entering a complete universe that is at once slightly foreign and futuristic and yet instantly recognizable as a probable dimension of our own world.  Unlike Dick Tracy, the costumes in this movie, which is also based on a series of comics, do not look like comic-book costumes, but like things real people would actually wear.  In fact, they are real things people actually do wear.  Or have worn.There is so much to look at.  There is so much to hear.  This is  one to watch more than once, especially since you will laugh so much you will not be able to hear all the lines the first time.The things that make this movie not just a nice pastime but genuinely great are the overall message (more on that later) and the character development, which is not just provided by the script and plot, but absolutely depends on the unique performance given by each actor.  The sincerity of William H. Macy as The Shoveler is probably the deepest performance in the film, the one which really makes the audience care about not just his character, but all the others.  His earnest, serious performance, combined with the sweetness of Louise Lasser as the Blue Raja's mother, and the earthiness of the actress who plays Mrs. Shoveler (Jenifer Lewis, I think), is what keeps this movie from degenerating into just another Gen-X-ridicule-fest.As the Bowler, Janeane Garofalo perfectly plays the usual sarcastic, demented, but strangely grounded character which keeps packing us in to see her.  Hank Azaria once again displays his vocal and facial versatility both as the Blue Raja and the man behind the costume.  Ben Affleck fully inhabits the character of  Mr. Furious, who is after all just trying to learn how to become a real boy.  Kel Mitchell's Invisible Boy is heart-piercingly sweet and charming, even at his most ridiculous.  Geoffrey Rush, Tom Waits, Wes Studi and Paul Rubens -- well, let's just say no one else could possibly have played their parts.  No, really.  They have done such a good job that anyone else in any of these roles becomes inconceivable.Now, the childless group with whom I saw this film ranged in age from 31 to 38, and we laughed ourselves ill, but also thoroughly loved the movie for the story, the acting, the costumes, the sets...  Still, I would venture to suggest that you could bring a child age 8 or above to this movie and not be sorry.  I think it's the overall message which makes this film, even with all the sometimes graphic violence and frequently coarse silliness, perfectly appropriate for slightly older children.  So what about that message?  It's the very best one:  Be yourself.  Accept yourself.  Respect yourself.  Follow your dreams.  Accept and respect other people and their dreams.  Do your best.  Have fun.",Mystery Men
143,KMM,Who are these Mystery Men?,8,4 May 2002,"Mystery Men is a comedy that is not for everyone. You either get it or you don't.   It takes a certain sense of humor to enjoy this film because a lot of the humor in the film is subtle. This is why I feel a lot of people did not understand the film or thought it was stupid.I never get tired of Mystery Men. It never takes itself too seriously and often displays a witty sarcasm when dealing with the main characters. Fans of Ben Stiller who are really familiar with his style of humor will have a much better appreciation for the kind of corny dialogue he expels throughout the movie.The set designers, art directors and Kinka Usher did a great job in capturing the mood of what a real super hero city could possibly be like. I think the setting and mood of Mystery Men is much more appealing as a comic book world than any of the Batman movies ever were. The Batman movies were just too fake. Another reason I think I enjoyed this film is that much of the mood and setting of this film reminded me of The Tick (animated show), another one of my favorite super hero shows. The supporting villains and super heroes, the dialogue and atmosphere could all be part of the Tick universe. Unfortunately the FOX live action show failed to capture what I feel Mystery Men did quite well as far as creating a comic book world. I for one would love to see another movie with the Mystery Men, but in all reality I know this will never happen. No matter, I still consider this to be one of my all time favorite comic book films.",Mystery Men

The sterling cast reminded me of one of the glories of the studio system when the supporting players really SUPPORTED the film. Everyone here is working on the same loopy wavelength (no mean feat in itself) and the result is very funny indeed. The superhero genre requires a certain number of gimmicks (what am I saying, it's ALL gimmicks!) and battles, but what I responded to were the characters and how they related to each other. The pace slackens now and then and the staging of some of the fights is muddy, but basically I say ""Bravos all around!""",Mystery Men

I watched ""The Tick"" on Fox when I returned to the States, and when Mystery Men first came out, I had to see it. I wasn't disapointed.This film is not for the serious film critic. It is a comedy spoof with a great line at every turn, ie: ""We are number one, all others are number two or lower."" Is that classic or what?The graphics are all digital and for the time, quite good.

I just liked the characters and felt uttlerly comfortable when, predictably, they believed in themselves, supported each other, and narrowly triumphed over evil.  I've seen many action flicks where I didn't care about the characters.  A friend asked me about Starship Troopers -- did the hero die?  Lots of the good guys die, I said, but it's OK; you don't care.  Now, I can't fathom why I cared about the bumbling heroes in Mystery Men, but I did.  Great acting, I guess.",Mystery Men
148,SpackerMatt,DIG THIS SHOVEL MAN!,10,25 May 2000,"I saw this movie the day it came out last year. Hilarious I thought. Well, now it's on video and I saw it again. I love this movie! The things they do are sometimes dumb but that's what makes it my third favorite movie of all time. The special effects are okay, but the witty dialog will have you rolling. I'm the kind of person that'll say i'm inspired by this movie, so if you like dramas and other stuff, avoid. But for all others, enjoy! The acting is superb. Hank Azaria is hands down the best (he's neither a commie, nor a fruit) followed by Ben Stiller (uh, don't correct me. it sickens me) and then William H. Macy delivering his best performance (outshining fargo) Everybody has praised everyone from macy to garafalo, but I think Kel Mitchell was pretty good as Invisible Boy.  Two problems: The most boring part of the film is the subplot of the romance between Stiller and Claire Forlani, and the Casanova parole hearing. Some scenes absolutely advance the story in no way, but they're a blast. Kinka and especially the writers tend to drag on a scene untill all it's hilarity is gone, but bam they switch and you're ready for more. I swear after seeing this, you will be tired from the explosive climax (which I think was pretty cool) The camera is pretty cool also, moving at a furious pace with the actors. Also, Tom Waits delivers an outstanding performance (he has this kinda cool bad hero coolness to him) and like someone else said, the best parts are when the characters show some humanness to them. Captain Amazing is pretty funny, (especially his speech to Casanova about his perfect plan-I was rolling) and rush is pretty cool as Casanova. One beef: the funniest comedian ever (eddie izzard) is almost wasted, but his heart is in the right place. So all in all, a wonderful movie. I give it twenty stars and hope that someday, everyone will see the brilliance in the film's best parody, the Six Million Dollar Man one. Laughing right now as I think about it. 20/10",Mystery Men

One who had seen it and panned it watched it again and came back to tell me that he was wrong the first time. He enjoyed it thoroughly.Enjoying this movie hinges on your attention to the dialog, in-jokes, and visual environment. The concept of ""superheroes with powers not quite super"" is rich in comic potential. Not all of that potential is tapped, but you only get 2 hours... and you have to squeeze the plot in too. I felt like Kinka Usher did a nice job of developing almost every character (except Lena Olin as supervillain Geoffrey Rush's psychiatrist) and providing a plot that did not seem stripped down. Throw in a lot of sarcastic humor and a great underground comic atmosphere in ""Champion City"" and I think it's a tight little movie.If you've been avoiding it, or if you have seen it once and found it odd or off-putting, give it a shot.

The movie was about 10-15 minutes too long and dragged in the middle. There are also needed to be one or two additional scenes added to explain some one twist in the film at the climax. Also,  Greg Kinnear who's the best thing about the movie is only in it for about 10 minutes. AND Geoffrey Rush's supervillian is annoying.

I am especially in awe of the relationships that develop between the stars of the film. It was said that much...if not most...of the dialog was improvised, giving the cast a chance to really play off of one another scene by scene. This tactic works well with regards to how they relate...and ultimately become friends over the course of the film. this could actually even be compared to another movie which shares similar motifs: ""Galaxy Quest."" This becomes a movie of ultimate redemption by the underdogs - not by the use of any inherent REAL superior powers, but they succeed simply because the cast in BOTH movies eventually live up to what they believe to be their destinies...by the belief in themselves!Most of the movie-going public and critics alike panned ""Mystery Men"" right out of the gate, which is a shame.

You'll have a grand time!  The movie is about wanna-be comic book superheroes and this groups pathetic exploits and discovery of their true heroism is the making of the most absurd humor.  The movie is a commentary about what real-life would be like for a superhero, he'd have to get corporate sponsors and keep business going if he was to continue to be famous.  The problem for Captain Amazing is that he's ""too good"" at his job and his agent tells him that he's got to drum up business to keep his sponsors - that's where the fun begins.

Director Kinka Usher should have stayed with music videos - if this movie had been a 5 minute infomercial, then it might have succeeded... but at almost two hours it just manages to bore you to death.In this movie, Usher showcases the idiotic school of ""look what I can do with a camera!"", with a lot of absolutely-in-your-face shots (is anybody interested in counting nose hairs?), and camera-on-the-ground-and-aimed-up shots.  At least the camera doesn't jerk around in short choppy movements (""Homicide"", anyone?), but that's about all that can be said for it.Most of the performances are dull and bland.  Kinnear usually has a comic presence, but in this one he's about as funny as a brick.  Lena Olin is completely wasted in this film - all of her lines can fit on to a single page.  Geoffrey Rush tries, but he can't do the monomaniacal supervillain, not with this material.  Only Garofalo and Reubens seemed to actually be able to do anything with the script such as it is... but for the most part the script is just a bunch of thrown-together moments that don't coalese into anything coherent and lifelike.  As for Wes Studi... that's the kind of character you thought only existed in a bad movie - oh, wait, here we are.The F/X are nothing fancy, and for the most part look like they were thrown in at the last minute.  They're not even consistent.Costuming is actually fairly decent... the wannabe heroes *look* like wannabe heroes - until they get into their new fancy costumes near the end, when they look like rejects from a KISS concert.The music is immediately forgettable... yet this is the kind of movie which cries out for a killer soundtrack.Take any superhero movie you've ever scene, mix together the bad and the indifferent material, and throw it into a ""wannabes need to save the day"" plot and you've got ""Mystery Men"".

161,tbeard,Better Than People Will Probably Tell You,7,6 August 1999,"A cynical approach is probably going to be the one taken by most of pretentious moviegoers after seeing Mystery Men. I happen to hate these types of people who stick their noses up at a good old-fashioned hilarious movie. There are a number of problems with the film. People could grow irksome of the characters; more specifically Claire Forlani's who is totally unnecessary. They could find the movie downright stupid, but I happened to love it. 	The characters, who some may find annoying as previously mentioned, truly make the movie. Janeane Garofalo's character, the bowler, is truly quirky and terribly funny. Nearly ever line she delivers brings a wave of laughter over the audience. The `There isn't enough beer in the world' line and many others shall be remembered for a long time to come. Not only this but her relationship with her father, bowling ball, skull or whatever it is is just another comical thing to be pointed out. Though these factors alone could make for a hilarious movie, the interaction between the characters make it that much better. The constant bickering between Stiller and Garofalo's characters seems to never get old and only funnier each time it happens. Macy's character, the shoveler, does a wonderful job of the husband trying passively to deal with his overbearing wife, Lucille. Azaria and his character's mother do this type of comical inter-household relationship very well. The one onscreen relationship, which was not terribly appealing or funny, was that of Stiller and Forlani. The obligatory love interest seemed to fall very short this time around. Forlani is a very talented actress and she does probably the best job possible considering her given role, but this one seems impossible to make anything of. She was a superfluous character from the get go and there was not much that she could do about it. But like I said, she is a very talented actress and her flawed character goes virtually unnoticed to many thanks to this fact. Almost all of the minor flaws in Mystery Men go unnoticed thanks to many things, the good acting, the witty one-liners, the quirky characters, and much more. True, this is not Oscar caliber stuff, but was it ever meant to be?

Mystery Men is the same way.  It is not only a parody of superhero movies; it is a parody of all movies that take themselves too seriously.

MYSTERY MEN is a send-up of every superhero flick you've ever seen, but its unlikely super-wannabes are so interesting, varied, and well-cast that they are memorable characters in their own right. Dark humor, downright silliness, bona fide action, and even a touching moment or two, combine to make this comic fantasy about lovable losers a true winner. The comedic talents of the actors playing the Mystery Men -- including one Mystery Woman -- are a perfect foil for Wes Studi as what can only be described as a bargain-basement Yoda, and Geoffrey Rush as one of the most off-the-wall (and bizarrely charming) villains ever to walk off the pages of a Dark Horse comic book and onto the big screen.

It seems as if every time I watch it, I see something I missed before.""Mystery Men"" is not just very funny, it is consistently funny throughout. Even better, most of it is relatively clean humour (not spotless, though), at least compared to some of the jokes you'll find in the typical modern comedy.That said, the superhero-parody genre has been more-or-less mined out by now, so perhaps ""Mystery Men"" will not age well.

The writing is uniquely humorous - replete with blamethrowing, Son of Pencilhead, The Bowler's Daughter et al.

This was an example of a bunch of really funny, non-household name guys getting together and punching out an awesome movie.  Ben Stiller as the impotent Mr. Furious, Hank Azaria as the knife-throwing Blue Raja, William H. Macy as the deadpan, but incredibly funny Shoveler, Janeane Garofalo as the Bowler's daughter, who constantly gets lectured by her dead father's skull...I mean, this cast was great, and their chemistry was better.Some people will complain about the lack of plot.  That is because they are stupid.  They're the same people who go see Jackie Chan movies and complain about the lack of plot.  Plot is not key to a comedy or action movie, people...it's just there to string the action or comedy sequences together.The comic intensity of the movie slows down for parts, such as Stiller's involvement with Claire Forlani's character, and the part where they rediscover teamwork.  Other than that, I haven't laughed this hard consistently at any other movie I've seen.  There are so many memorable quotes for this movie, that there will be fuel for my e-mail signature fil es until the Y3K bug hits.  (Yes, 3 not 2...the 2 one is all media hype.)There are some unexpected plot moments in the movie, stuff you want to see in big budget flicks that nobody ever does, counter cliche stuff.

I mean, technically AVENGERS is far worse and makes absolutely no sense, but at least it can be enjoyed in a traffic-accident sort of way. MYSTERY MEN is so smug and complacent with its hip-90s-ironic approach that it's just painful to sit through when the laughs just don't exist (and no, the 6 Million Dollar Man joke wasn't funny...it was just more proof of this film's need to rely on uninspired pop culture jokes than to challenge its audience with truly original satire).And one final note -Janeane Garofalo: You're not as hip as you think you are.",Mystery Men

I sat there for what seemed like ages whilst failing to be entertained by any aspect of this film, not helped by my family watching it because I had said it was supposed to be really funny and their reaction was less than pleased.
There was not one single part of this film that entertained me in any way and I was genuinely disappointed in the fact that such a cast could produce such a terrible film. William H Macy, who i consider one of the most underrated actors of our time, and the rest of the cast looked like they were really trying to make something good out of this film, yet they failed for an inexplicable reason. Maybe it was the script, or the jokes or the general idea of the film but it just did not work in any way, it tried to rip off many aspects of the superhero genre in an intelligent way, but failed.Overall I have to say that watching this film was one of the most painful experiences of my movie loving life and if you ever come across a copy of this film i urge you to take the tape and burn it to prevent others from watching it.

Heck, I can be like Ben Stiller's character anytime when there is a blackout during tedious work or stuck in traffic, missing a good game on TV. These are skills and characteristics more logical for a ordinary hero in everyday life. The storyline is simple enough to evoke what we can at least do in desperate moment.

Stiller and Garofalo in one movie and with such great back up actors such as William Macy and Paul Reuben, I did not think this movie could miss.  Boy, was I wrong.  It took me two times to get through this awful example of cinematography.  I found this movie a typical example of the best lines being used in the trailer.  I could not believe with such great comic talent in this movie, nothing funny happened.  I can only assume the funniest parts of this movie ended up, for some unknown reason, on the cutting room floor.  If you want to watch a good Ben Stiller and Janeane Garofalo performance I would have to recommend `Reality Bites'; far superior to Mystery Men.

191,Sundance-28,An enjoyable movie...,6,28 August 1999,"Mystery Men is no mystery. It's just a fun, enjoyable summer movie. I, for one, am glad to see Hank Azaria (The Blue Raja) get to strut his stuff in front of the camera for a change. And the rest of the cast was terrific. With Bill Macy, Ben Stiller, Janeane Garofalo, Paul Ruebens, Geoffrey Rush and Wes Studi, this has to be the coolest, and most eclectic, cast in recent movie history. What's more, each cast member is given enough screen time to showcase their formidable comic talents. Ben Stiller is especially funny as Mr. Furious. And after seeing Bill Macy as The Shoveler, I had to ask myself: Is there nothing this man cannot do? He does comedy (Mystery Men), Drama (Boogie Nights) and twisted suspense (Fargo), all with equal aplomb. This is definitely one of the most underrated actors in all of Hollywood.As for the rest of the cast, well, who doesn't love Janeane? And Wes Studi is a riot dispensing questionable, albeit well meaning, advice as The Sphinx. Paul Ruebens' turn as The Spleen is nothing if not nauseatingly funny. And, surprisingly, Kel Mitchell holds his own against this talented cast.The casting of Greg Kinnear as the sold-out, egotistical Captain Amazing was flawless. The only cast member who actually seems wasted here is Rush, who, as supervillain Cassanova Frankenstein, is not nearly as over the top funny as he could have been. Blame this on a script that doesn't give him much to work with, though. At any rate, this is a very enjoyable movie with some tremendously funny scenes and well worth it for anyone just looking to escape for a couple of hours.",Mystery Men
192,scinatfilm,"Lots of fun, don't take it seriously",8,20 August 1999,"This film was funny consistently through much of it, though it did drag a little at the end.  The great thing about a film like this is that it's not quite a spoof; rather, it's gently poking fun at the somewhat ludicrous world of comic books and superheroes.Janeane Garofalo was delightfully acerbic as always, with just a hint of the teen immaturity that characterized the rest of the team. I would have liked to have seen Hank Azaria without the silly British accent, but any film with him in it is a treat.  William H. Macy delivers some of the funniest lines as the Shoveler, and Paul Reubens was amusing as the flatulent Spleen. Ben Stiller didn't annoy me as much as he usually does, mainly because, as Mr. Furious, he got to do one of the few things he does well: get mad.Aside from the cast, the camera angles and special effects poked fun at some of the more inane comic books incarnations we've seen recently.  Some of the humor was a little too slapstick for my taste, but this is one of those films that is so delightfully stupid that it's funny, though a touch overblown at times.

The film tries to be funny but comes across as grating to the nerves. The characters are all one-dimensional caricatures that fail to win audience empathy. It's as if the writer was thinking ""oh if I give them all some bizarre quirk I will have produced unique and interesting characters"" but he instead achieves utter banality. Even in the genres of screwball comedy or parody, this film fails to deliver the goods.

Along with South Park, Mystery Men takes the cake at being the best.  Those who said that they hated this movie completley missed the point.  This movie is supposed to be a mockery of all of the superhero movies that drain us of our money every summer.  That's why the ""real"" super hero, Captain Amazing, had sponsors for crying out loud!!  He looked more like a NASCAR driver than a superhero.

201,etdweasel,A Comic Gem!,10,3 January 2003,"MINOR SPOILERS AHEAD!I've heard a lot of negative comments about this film, and I think many people are missing the point. If you rented this because ""Spider-Man"" was out then you obviously didn't take the time to read the box. This movie is exactly what it set out to be; a stinging, yet sweet, send up of the whole super-hero genre.Here's a group of super-hero wannabes, led by the magnificent William H. Macy as The Shoveler, a family man with a wife who keeps pestering him to find another line of work. These guys are Bruce Wayne without money; The Shoveler doesn't have a Batmoblie, he has a Rambler wagon. The closest thing to a Fortress of Solitude that Azaria's Blue Raja can muster is his bedroom in his mothers house. Stiller's Mr. Furious is a frustrated Incredible Hulk. Studi's Sphinx spouts Yoda-like platitudes. Reubens' Spleen leaves criminals wishing for something as benign as a mere spider web. Kinnear's cynical, endorsement-laden Captain Amazing is a bored publicity hound who's bespectacled alter ego eagerly facilitates the release of his most dangerous nemesis, Rush's psychotic Casanova Frankenstein, to justify his continued existence. When Frankenstein and his disco-dancing cohorts capture Captain Amazing, our little rag-tag group decide that it's their duty to step up to the challenge.The best satire is perpetrated by those familiar with their target, and here the film is dead on. The sets and props are very ""Burton-esque"" - dark and brooding in the best Batman tradition. Coupled with superb casting and an eclectic soundtrack, the result is a satisfying skewering of a sanctimonious lot.I've never seen the comic series the film is based on, but I'm sure that liberties have been taken. That's life, get over it. Standing alone, this film accomplishes what Keenan Ivory Wayans accomplished with ""I'm Gonna Git You Sucka"" and Mike Myers is currently doing with the Austin Powers series; poking fun at a class of cinema long overdue for a poking!",Mystery Men

Many of the scenes appear to be out of a comic book and much darker (visually -- not story wise) than what I expected. Granted, this may not be the funniest movie ever made, especially if you are into very crude sexist jokes as this has very little of that (compared to others like Something About Mary or American Pie). As you rewatch it, several jokes stand out and get funnier. If you have ever read a comic book or watched a comic book-type movie (Batman, X-Men, etc.) and liked them, you will probably enjoy the subtle humor that continues throughout the movie. If you didn't like them, you may like the respectful ridicule that this film has for those. If you did like this movie, the dvd has some cool extras. (8/10)",Mystery Men

204,Goggler,Definitely worth a rent,7,6 March 2000,"I can't say that this film deserves anywhere near the amount of vitriol being heaped on it by some reviewers. Yes, it's bogged down by an overly-padded running time, hamfisted editing, and an overreliance on cheeseball special effects. And it lacks much of the energy a comedy needs to get your average audience member to sit through it without checking his or her watch. On the other hand, it's also got some laugh-out-loud funny lines, a talented and earnest cast, and the classic underdog premise. Macy, Stiller, and Azaria are brilliant as the ""core"" team, and Garofalo and Studi do superb work adding conflict and variety to the team. I can't say Reubens or Mitchell added much to the film overall, though each had a few chances to shine. The plot, as I said above, is your classic ""underdog-makes-good"" stuff. No surprises there, since you know they're going to triumph. What makes it worthwhile is not the absurd, gaudy heroes and villains, but the dialogue and interplay between the characters. Underneath it all, these people are children at heart, who just want to do right. The best scenes in the film give this film its emotional grounding. Look at Azaria's relationship with his long-suffering mother; Macy's endearing innocence in his unwillingness to accept Cap. Amazing's secret identity; Stiller's rage (not unlike that one weird, spazzy kid you once knew who'd always go into quivering, impotent rages on the playground); Garofalo's desire to avenge her father. This childlike belief that a sense of justice and goodness will always make the world a better place, is the true appeal of super-hero comics; and underneath its parodic exterior, ""Mystery Men"" shows us why these hackneyed comic-book tropes matter to so many.It never really gels into a satisfying whole, due to the huge number of half-baked subplots (romance, family life, conflicts within the team, etc.), but the main plot is such loopy fun that it makes up for that. The fact that it's supposed to be good, nonsensical fun seems to be lost on some of the reviewers here, so I'll issue a caveat: if you're the type of viewer who finds his enjoyment of an Itchy and Scratchy cartoon ruined by the unexplained and illogical (""Am I to believe this is some sort of.. *snort*... _magic_ xylophone?""), then you are far too literal-minded and humorless for this film.

For some reason he likes to shoot characters saying their lines straight to the camera from eight inches away. Not once, but all through the movie and it looks terrible.

209,hotlurvemachine,An enjoyable 'super hero' spoof,8,16 July 2002,"I must confess that I avoided watching this film as I thought it sounded rather silly...However, despite my initial reservations, I finally gave in and watched it - and was surprised at how enjoyable I found it.This film is a superb spoof of super hero films like the Batman films, the X-Men, Spiderman, e.t.c - and yet it still retains some original ideas.The humour seemed reminiscent of the Naked gun movies, so if you liked those then I would recommend this to you.It could have been funnier and sillier (perhaps a few Batman 'BAMS' and 'BIFFS' during the final fight-scene), but I think the production team wanted to keep an element of more subtle tongue-in-cheek humour and in so-doing they were able to retain an element of plausibility (if thats the right word ?!) and a better story overall. In fact, I'd say the story itself is actually stronger than those of the later Batman films and has more elements to it.The main characters seemed better developed and better scripted than most of the super-hero films that they are sending-up. I thought the main baddie (bizarrely named 'Casanova Frankenstein' and deliberately hammed-up by Geoffrey Rush) was particularly good, though he didn't seem to have many scenes... This is compensated by the frequent appearance of his 70's disco-obsessed henchmen, who I found hilarious !Overall - an enjoyable film as long as you don't take it too seriously.",Mystery Men
210,MurphAndTheMagicTones,A True Statement That Timing Is Everything In Hollywood,8,29 November 2015,"With all of the Marvel and DC movies coming out these days, this film should have been a monster success. The only problem is, it came out when superhero movies were just getting started. Had this been released in 2009 instead of 1999, after X-Men, Spider-Man, Superman Returns, and Iron Man all came out, audiences would have gone crazy over this lovable group of wannabe superheroes who have to save the day when real superhero, Captain Amazing, is captured.Certainly few movies boast a murder's row of actors such as this movie did. William H. Macy was hysterical as family man The Shoveler, Hank Azaria's Blue Raja was a master of throwing forks (never knives), Janeane Garofalo (back when she was likable) was The Bowler, Kel Mitchell as Invisible Boy (who can only turn invisible if no one is watching), and even Paul ""Pee Wee Herman"" Reubens was a riot as The Spleen, who took passing gas to a whole new level.The ringleader of the group is Mr. Furious (Ben Stiller) who seems to become the focal point of the movie more than anyone else. I thought it a bit ironic Stiller would trash this film given most of the scenes that annoyed me involved him, although he does redeem his role by movie's end.The group of supervillians is impressive as well, led by Geoffrey Rush as Casanova Frankenstein and Eddie Izzard and Pras as the two Tonys. Even Captain Amazing (Greg Kinnear) isn't much in the way of a superhero to the Mystery Men, given how condescending he acts towards them and how full of himself he is. Kinnear did provide a great performance there, no question.If you're a fan of what Marvel is putting out these days, this movie will make you laugh and cheer for the good guys.",Mystery Men

If a movie breaks me away from my work, its a good one. Not in this case, I wasn't drawn from my desk anymore then 2 minutes or so. I do believe that his movie hinted on good points tho. Being a satire, I'm sure displayed the correct points to be made, what those are, I can not honestly tell you. The characters are witty and rather dopey for the ""common superhero"" and do a good job making the movie what it is, for me...a comic relief, diss on superheros. *thinks* Mystery Men would most likely be enjoyed by the younger group, appreciated for its jerky sarcasm by the older. It didn't keep me awake in the least, and my sisters fiancé didn't do his usual ""jump up and holler for joy"" routine in the action scenes.

If you never found anything particularly entertaining or humorous about that genre, you won't enjoy ""MM.""  As one who grew up on superheroes, I loved this movie!  First of all, great concept!  Second, great script!  Thirdly (and not least), fab cast!

I have always been a fan of Wes Studi's, thank whatever you hold holy that he wore a mask through the film so maybe people won't identify the film with him.It starts of promisingly with a stylistic spoof of the cinematography of the Batman films and then just loses something...like a coherent plot and half decent effects.The jokes are telegraphed an hour before the punchline comes, and even then they fall flat.

Just the tongue in cheek (corporate sponsorship, glasses parody, etc) portrayal of ""Captain Amazing"" should be enough to tell people HELLO THIS IS A VERY BLACK, VERY COMIC SATIRE.

216,zaayrdragon,"Difficult to put into words, but fantastic!",9,30 March 2004,"******WARNING:  MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS**************So who are these ""Mystery Men?""  Simply put, the Mystery Men are a group of sub-Heroes desperately trying to live out their adolescent fantasy lives while botching both their real identities and their super identities.  The Shoveller (Bill Macy) works construction during the day, and at night, leaves his wife and kids at home while he cruises the street looking for crimes to tackle with his extraordinary and unique Shovel-fighting style. The Blue Raja (Hank Azaria) sells silverware to newlyweds by day and flings tableware at crackpot villians by night, if his mom isn't keeping him busy with the latest snooping.  Mr. Furious works in a junk yard to earn his pay, then takes out his frustration on his friends at night, tossing ill-conceived one-liners at friend and foe alike and threatening to get really angry (leaving everyone to wonder, So What?).  Ben Stiller breathes such life into this character, you can't help but love him.These three spend their nights trying to capture that 'moment of glory' they've dreamed about... becoming real Super Heroes.  Obviously, it could happen.  Champion City has Captain Amazing, after all... a flying, fighting super-cop with enough corporate logos on his costume to stop an extra bullet or two.  Greg Kinnear turns in a stellar performance as a middle-aged sellout trying to recapture his fans attention in the twilight of his career.To bring back that 'extra magic' that might win the endorsements again, C.A. frees Casanova Frankenstein, a WAAAAAY over-the-top menace played to chilling perfection by Goeffrey Rush.  This lunatic genius has created a 'psychofrakulator' to warp Champion City into a reflection of his own insanities... and ends up capturing C.A. within hours of his release from prison.  This leaves only the Mystery Men to stop Frankenstein's evil plan, but with such henchmen as the Disco Boys protecting Frankenstein, the trio are going to need a little help.Recruiting commences, and after a painful recruitment party, the team settles in with The Bowler (Janeane Garofolo), who initially has the only real talent in the team, with her mystic bowling ball seemingly animated by the vengeful spirit of her dead father;  the Invisible Boy (Kel Mitchell), who CLAIMS to turn invisible when ABSOLUTELY NO ONE is looking at him; the Spleen (Paul Reubens), granted mystically powerful flatulence by an angry gypsy;  and the much underused Sphinx (Wes Studi), who is shown to be able to cut guns in half with his mind, then spends much of the rest of the movie spouting inane riddles and acting over-wise.This film really is a cross-genre romp.  Anyone wanting to pigeon-hole films into neat little categories is fighting a losing battle.  This is a spoof/parody of the superhero genre - from the pseudo-Burton sets recycled endlessly (and occasionally decorated with more spoof material) to the ridiculous costumes, the comic-book genre gets a pretty good send-up.  But at the same time, it is a serious superhero flick, as well.  Both at once. While not a necessarily unique idea in itself (for example, this movie is in some ways reflective of D.C. Comic's short-lived Inferior Five work), it is fairly innovative for the big screen.  It offers the comic-book world that requires a suspension of disbelief to accept anyway, then throws in the inevitable wanna-bes - and we all know, if superheroes were real, so would these guys be real.  If the Big Guy with the S were flying around New York City, you'd see a half-dozen news reports about idiots in underwear getting their butts kicked on a regular basis.  Sure, the Shoveller fights pretty well, and the Blue Raja hurls forks with great accuracy - all parts of the super-hero world.  But does that make them genuine super-heroes?  Only in their minds.This movie is also a comedy, albeit a dark one.  Inevitable, when trying to point out the patent ridiculous nature of super-heroics.  One-liners fly as the comic geniuses on stage throw out numerous bits to play off of. Particularly marvelous is the dialogue by Janeane Garofalo with her bowling ball/father.  Yet, it isn't a comedy in the sense of side-splitting laughter or eternally memorable jokes.  It mixes in a dose of drama, of discovery and of romance, but never really ventures fully into any of it.
What really makes Mystery Men a good film, in the end, is that it is very engaging.  The weak/lame good guys are eventually justified and, for one shining moment, really become super-heroes;  justice is served;  and the movie ends with a scene that reeks of realism (as much realism as is possible in a world where bowling balls fly and glasses make the perfect disguise).  If the viewer stops trying to label the film, then the film can be a great romp.Of course, no movie is perfect.  Claire Forlani comes off as bored and directionless as Mr. Furious' love interest, in spite of having a pivotal role as his conscience.  Tom Waits seems somehow confused by his own lines as the mad inventor Dr. Heller, although his opening scenes picking up retired ladies in the nursing home is worth watching alone.  And the villians are never more than gun-toting lackeys (a point of which is made in the film).  The cinematography is choppy and disjointed (such as happens in the average comic book, so it is excusable), the music sometimes overpowers the scenery, and the special effects are never quite integrated into the rest very well.Yet, overall, this film is incredible.  You probably have to be a fan of comics and the superhero genre to really appreciate this movie, but it's a fun romp and a good way to kill a couple of hours and let your brain rest.8/10 in my opinion.",Mystery Men
217,ZuniMtnRailroad,See it for what it is!,9,8 May 2004,"This film is sure to bring a smile to anyone who's ever been or (willingly) looked after a little boy.  It's that sort of comedy that carries this movie along.To be exact, its the sort of comedy where you see the actors making fun of who they used to be, in a natural and unpretentious way.  Part of the success of this movie comes from how well each play their ridiculous characters so straightly, in even the most absurd situations.  There are hardly any scenes where the characters laugh at anything, much less themselves.  To them, who they are, what they're doing and the oddball world they inhabit make perfect sense and need to be taken seriously.Another reason this movie is a hit with those lucky enough to appreciate it, is the collection of memorable, archetypal characters that don't bother to be constrained to the ""real"" world.  Can you say ""Heller""?Maybe some are revulsed by how over-the-top Mystery Men tries to be. They're missing the point; it isn't trying to do anything, just turning everything into a laugh.  Forget realism just this once.  Over-the-top can be a very good thing, given the right vehicle.

Add in Claire Forlani for the beauty and the stage should have been set for a movie worth owning.  Sadly, it is not.Movies based off of comic books are, admittedly, harder to pull off then movies made out of your typical novel, but can be done (i.e. Batman, Superman and Blade).  `Mystery Men', however, does not find the fun that you get in the comic world.  The characters fail to make themselves all that interesting.  The story line seems to drag at times and even the `romantic' involvement between Stiller and Forlani fails spark an interest.In all honesty I have not seen the movie in it's entirety due to the fact that I, along with four others that were with me, fell asleep at the theatre while watching it.  It is the only time I have ever fallen asleep in a movie theatre and that says quite a bit to me.There is one decent performance in the movie though.  I do believe that Greg Kinnear did a great job with his part.

Onto some bullets"". Now this movie is not for everybody, its mostly stupid humor like Zoolander or Dodgeball; so if you hated these movies I would probably recommend you to steer clear. Overall it was an enjoyable movie, about a group of superhero wannabes, who end up becoming real heroes in the end. It's a vastly overrated comedy that many people probably haven't seen yet, because like me before viewing it expected it to be utter garbage. After viewing this film, I finally understand why this movie was able to assemble such a superstar cast which includes Ben Stiller, William H. Macy, Hank Azaria, and even that kid from Good Burger.

I saw this movie somewhere in 2001 or 2003 and I've watched it many times over the years and it still remains a favorite of mine, due mostly to fond childhood memories. It's not a perfect movie, but it definitely deserves another look and perhaps a cult following to this movie.I always have my 90s nostalgia movies and look back at them just like The Fifth Element, Ghost In The Shell and The City Of Lost Children as good movies to watch over and over again just like The Mystery Men.STORY: In the metropolis of Champion City, the would-be superhero team of Mr. Furious (Ben Stiller), the Shoveler (William H. Macy), and the Blue Raja (Hank Azaria) attempt to make a name for themselves, but their suspect skills make them ineffective, and they find themselves upstaged by the city's most successful superhero, Captain Amazing (Greg Kinnear). However, Amazing is finding that his effectiveness at fighting crime has practically made his job obsolete, and without any worthy adversaries remaining (some of them are either dead, in exile, or still in jail), his corporate sponsors are beginning to pull their funding. To create a need for himself, Amazing uses his alter ego, billionaire lawyer Lance Hunt, to argue for the release of insane supervillain Casanova Frankenstein (Geoffrey Rush). The plan backfires; once reunited with Tony P (Eddie Izzard) and his Disco Boys, Casanova Frankenstein blows up the insane asylum, captures Amazing, and prepares to unleash a doomsday device: the ""Psycho-frakulator"", which lethally bends reality. Mr. Furious, while spying on Casanova Frankenstein's mansion, discovers Amazing's capture and informs the others.After an unsuccessful rescue attempt, the three realize they need more allies, and through word-of-mouth and try-outs, they recruit Invisible Boy (Kel Mitchell), the Spleen (Paul Reubens), and the Bowler (Janeane Garofalo). The newly formed team ""assaults"" Casanova, which only succeeds in annoying him and damaging his car. While drunk from celebrating their victory, the team is nearly killed in retaliation by Tony P and the Disco Boys, but they are saved at the last minute by the Sphinx (Wes Studi). The Sphinx trains them, but his methods annoy Mr. Furious – he has them complete rote team-building exercises and speaks exclusively in Chiasmus. They also seek out mad scientist Doc Heller (Tom Waits), who specializes in non-lethal weaponry, to equip them for their battle.The group breaks into Casanova's mansion during a gathering of several of the city's gangs; but, while attempting to free Captain Amazing, they inadvertently set off the Psycho-frakulator, killing him instead. Without Amazing, the team despairs of saving the city, but the Shoveler delivers a pep-talk that succeeds in uniting and inspiring them.With new-found purpose, they assault the mansion and, by making effective use of their negligible superpowers and Heller's weapons, manage to subdue most of Casanova Frankenstein's henchmen. Unfortunately, as the heroes approach Casanova Frankenstein, he reveals that he is holding Mr. Furious' girlfriend Monica (Claire Forlani) hostage, and proceeds to activate the Psycho-frakulator, which begins to wreak havoc upon the city. While the team tries to stop the device, Mr. Furious takes on Casanova Frankenstein. After initially taking a beating, Mr. Furious unleashes his inner rage and manages to fight effectively for the first time. He defeats Casanova Frankenstein, who is thrown into the core of the Psycho-frakulator and killed by its reality-bending powers. The rest of the team helps The Bowler use her bowling ball to destroy the device and escape the mansion as it implodes.The team is interviewed by reporters, begging to know their team name. As they argue among themselves, one reporter states ""Well, whatever you may call them, Champion City will forever owe a debt of gratitude to these 'Mystery Men',"" but the others are too busy arguing to hear it.The film received mixed to positive reviews from critics. Rotten Tomatoes gives the film a score of 60% based on 101 reviews; the consensus states: ""Absurd characters and quirky gags are brought to life by a talented cast, providing this superhero spoof with lots of laughs."" On Metacritic, the film has a 65/100 rating based on 24 critics, signifying ""generally favorable reviews"".Jonathan Romney said that it was ""a desperately hit-and-miss affair"". Michael Dequina of The Movie Report said that it ""fails to come up with worthy gags and one-liners for the able cast."" Steve Murray of Cox News Service gave it a negative review, saying ""Mystery Men is like its hapless heroes. It's a wannabe that has the best intentions – including a pronounced anti-gun stance – but none of the knack it takes to save the day, or itself.""British television channel Film4 gave it a positive review, saying it was ""Hugely entertaining – especially for those with a thing for superheroes.""I loved this movie at always in my 90s nostalgia side of me.I will give it AN BETTER MOVIE BESIDE THAT HORRIBLE SUICIDE SQUAD MOVIE out of 10.",Mystery Men

Although she did come in to the film towards the middle, she had the brightest and most comedic presence.

So, Mr. Furious and The Shoveler fit right in to my world.Ben Stiller has a gift for subtle humor in the midst of chaos.  His Mr. Furious, a man with the power to get really, really mad, will hit a chord with most men.  Janeane Garofalo fits right in to this style of humor. Paul Reubens is lovably disgusting as the only one in the group with a real ""Super Power"".  Just don't invite him over for dinner.

The humor ranges from silly jokes about bodily functions to stinging political satire.  But what is really great is the acting.  Through my experience I have come to believe that top quality comedy is achieved through character, and the portrayal of character in mystery men is superb. Every character is funny in his own way and each character has a very unique and consistent personality.  Prepare yourself for a lot of parody and satire in this one.

The casting is the best since Toy Story: All of the actors are perfect for their role.  The jokes run the gamut from gross stuff all the way to intelligent humor, plus there's plenty of parody, and slapstick.  The funniest stuff though, is the subtle humor that one has to pay close attention to catch.  Sure, it's not perfect.  The in-your-face camera work does get a bit unpleasant after awhile, and nobody has any idea what the heck what the villain is really trying to do, but that's not really the point anyway.

It is a flawed masterpiece (that's right, I said the word 'masterpiece' in conjunction with this film). Despite some dodgy editing alongside a director known for making commercials (and it shows!), it actually has many ingenious concepts. The idea that Champion City's most successful superhero is obsessed with his own celebrity and is therefore portrayed as a bad guy ties in perfectly with the anti-capitalist themes in the film. The problems arise when the style of comedy reaches juvenile level, and though at times that brand of humour is funny there is perhaps a little too much of it. There are, however, many hilarious moments, some of which are incredibly subtle for such an 'in your face' production. For example, when Captain Amazing is complaining to his agent about losing his pepsi endorsement he talks about what it means to him, in his heart, and he promptly hits his chest where his heart would be only to hear the hollow sound of his suit's exterior. Pure anti-capitalism! Finally, a mention of the cast. The film has a wonderful cast: Ben Stiller, Bill Macy, Hank Azaria, Greg Kinnear, Geoffrey Rush, Jeanne Garofalo, Eddie Izzard, Paul (Pee-wee Herman) Reubens and, best of all, the deep-voiced singing legend that is Tom Waits.

Endowed with martial arts knowledge, a large carrot mask with a flame at the top, an arsenal of unique weapons, a set of flippers (which he wears at all times, just in case he needs to swim), and a small AM/FM radio implanted in his chest by aliens that gives him track tips, he suited up to fight crime.  That could out weird anything the mystery men could throw out.  But, on to the movie...The Movie, is one of the great examples when something obscure gets just the right enough attention to really pull something off well.  Spawn tried to get a following like Mystery Men, but it was too religious minded to really get a following like Mystery Men.  X-Men, although I sort of liked it, really sold out to the public, almost completely rewriting the brilliant story from Marvel comix.  Mystery Men had just the right chemistry to excel, and it did.  The actors are well known enough to carry their own following, but not so well known as to change the movie to suit them.  Ben Stiller, Hank Azaria, Jeannine Garofalo, Keenen Ivory Wayans, and the return of Paul Reubbons marks this movie as one of the strangest mixes of Actor since MARS ATTACKS! albeit this movie is good, while MARS ATTACKS! was lacking.The only problem I noted with this movie, and I feel like a jerk pointing it out, the plot has a few holes in it, especially when they storm the castle with their new ""weapons.""  In the DVD deleted scenes, it shows them using some unexplained weapons on the Frat boys, but of course, those scenes were deleted.  What bothered me was a little side plot about the Shoveler trying to hint at Mr. Furious that he's bringing the team down, that was unnecessary.Don't get me wrong, the good outweighs the slightly notgood, ten thousand times fold.  This movie would make the most die hard Flaming Carrot comic fan happy, as well as those who have never even read a comic book before. This is one of the best superhero movies ever.  With a excellent graphics, big name actors, and an unorthodox storyline, this movie shines the brightest in the dark field of the obscure.",Mystery Men
234,tpiecemanc,Great Movie,10,15 September 2002,This movie has gotten poor reviews from the get go.  I hear everyone talking and saying it was horrible or stupid.  Well the people that say that are admitting what the film was shooting for.  The film was not a super hero film although it had super heros in it.  It was a comedy that was spoofing the super hero genre.  This movie was meant to be stupid.  It was meant for you to sit back and let all your cares fly out the window.  It was made for enjoyment.  It is a funny movie and yes there are things about it that could change although I cannot think of one right now.  This is one of my favorite movies based on the fact that it has the guts not to take itself seriously. And anyone who says its a dumb and stupid film is right.  It did exactly what it set out to be.  I just wish they'd make a sequel.,Mystery Men
235,Stevezilla1961,Great fun and too bad it didn't do better,10,12 May 2006,"This movie deserved better It's great fun, has some wonderful jokes and sight gags, some in-stuff for the ""Geeks"" amongst us (And we know who we are), and the effects are indeed effectual. Watching Paul Reubens fart in the face of an Academy Award winner is worth the price of admission alone. I never read the comics series before I saw the movie, but have since. as good as they are, I still recommend MM the film. (Although having the Flaming Carrot as a character would have been cool, too) Greg Kinnear is, well,...amazing as Captain Amazing, and NO ONE ELSE could be The Shoveller except William H.

Both movies cross the line of decency a few times with their 'bathroom' humour, but there is so much happening on different levels in this film. Wes Studi (you must see him in Geronimo!), William H.

239,roadrash,One more mangled bunch of gags in search of a script.,5,9 August 1999,"All right, I was hyped and looking forward to this, so it's probably just my disappointment talking here.  Lets start with the great parts: Great Cast. Great Sets.  Great FX.  And, okay, a couple of good (not great) gags. Lame script.  This entire movie is one big gag with a bunch of little gags thrown in like sprinkles on your frozen yogurt.  The over all plot was not interesting to me, and seemed like it could have been so much better.  On top of this, there were too many characters, and so none of them were developed as well as they could be.  Of all the wonderful actors scattered half-hazardly around this plot, only Ben Stiller is developed as a deep character.  I would have liked to see Janeane Garofalo used in a much more intelligent way.  For instance: her relationship with her father (a very funny running gag) was used only for a couple of short bits, where as it could have been one of the main points of the story.  But I digress.  I only have one piece of advice for anyone who is thinking of seeing this.  DON'T go see ""The Matrix"" the night before.  I did,(for the fourth time) and I think this may have ruined ""Mystery Men"" for me.  A great movie seems only to make a so-so one seem bad.",Mystery Men

242,WillPowerATL,"Good for laughs, and superhero fans...",8,27 July 1999,"As a comic book reader, who still sees myself as a total kid at heart, I admit I might have been a bit biased towards this movie.  I mean, there hasn't been a good superhero movie out for quite some time (NOTE: Batman Forever was NOT a good superhero movie).  I really wanted this film to be good, and unlike most of my recent trips to the cinema (read Blair Witch Project) I wasn't disappointed.Mystery Men was definitely not a high-effects, tension-filled action flick, it was a comedy.  And on that basis, it was a success.  It had everyone in the small theater laughing, and got applause and laughs right through the final scene.  Stiller and Garofolo are hilarious together, as always, and Azaria adds just the right touch of craziness.  William H. Macy plays a great straight man, while Kel Mitchell and the fart-powered Paul Rubens are added just to keep the kiddies happy.Though the sets are bizarre (and at times seem like ripoffs from both Batman and Blade Runner), and some of the jokes are obvious, it is still just plain funny.  There are some lines that will catch even the most jaded viewer off-guard, and bring tears from the belly-laughers among us.I definitely recommend this movie.  Although not an all-time classic, it is twice as funny as the latest Austin Powers retread.  The writing is good, and the cast is GREAT.  If you're worried, plan on the matinee and pay less, but either way you'll be pleasantly surprised.  I mean, who among us doesn't root for the losers once in a while?",Mystery Men
243,TommyGrl,Mystery Men was a hilarious movie.,7,8 August 1999,"Mystery Men was one of those funny, but pointless movies. Like Austin Powers. Except, Austin Powers was funnier. I rated this movie as a 7, cuz it wasn't all that great. But there were some parts of it that really cracked me up. Any movie with Kel Mitchell and Janeane Garafalo is an excellent comedy. If you like movies that are funny, but pointless. Then you should see this. But if you think funny movies are a waste to see in movie theaters, but are doubting about this movie, then I suggest you don't see this movie until it's out on video.-TommyGrl",Mystery Men
244,rnapier,A must-see for comic book fans,7,17 August 1999,"For lovers of comic books, Mystery Men is a real winner. It is a wonderful parody of the whole ""spandex"" genre. While I could have done without The Spleen (Paul Reubens of Pee Wee Herman fame), even he provides a great foil for The Bowler (Janeane Garofalo) in a few scenes.William H. Macy (The Shoveler) brings this movie back from the edge of farce to make this more than just a late-summer knee-slapper. Like good comic books, Mystery Men tries to make some small social statements without letting it get in the way of the story.The movie does have its faults. The Spleen is a definite play to the 8-year-old boys, and the ""be yourself"" bits were a little forced, but it's still a very enjoyable movie, and a must-see for modern comic books fans.",Mystery Men
245,mayhemme,Slightly mindless entertainment,9,10 September 1999,"I really loved this film.  I went out and bought the soundtrack because I liked the music so much (I have a thing for Smash Mouth's ""All Star"" especially).I'm sure other reviews explain the plot fully, so I won't bother.  I will say that you shouldn't see this movie if you're looking for intellectual stimulation, because you really won't find much.  I went to see it after working in the summer heat for six hours peddling sunglasses; between the popcorn, air conditioning, and rampant gags, I had a great time.  But no, this movie isn't rocket science humor, and I don't think it ever claimed to be.The seven MMs themselves were, in my opinion, a completely delicious treat. The ""terribly mysterious"" Sphinx made me giggle as he forced his six teammates to construct for themselves impressive new superhero costumes. Roy, aka Mr. Furious, was the only one who got on my nerves periodically, but his attempts at making relevant puns is amusing.  Eddie, the Shoveler, is the team's most sensible member, and the dialogue he shares with his long-suffering wife is a lot of fun.  (""If anybody pukes in my swimming pool, I'm divorcing you.""  ""That's fair."")  The gaseous Spleen and the much-ignored Invisible Boy (""Dad, I'm going to my room with three strange men I just met"") are edged just slightly into the background, but they are eventually treated as vital team members, and they are sometimes very vital to the humor.My two favorites were Carol, the Bowler, and Jeffrey, the Blue Raja.  I hope that if there's a MM sequel, these two get together.  Carol is the only superhero who possesses something in the way of an actual genuine power -- her dead father's head encased in a bowling ball delivers deadly strikes to his daughter's foes.  Blue Raja (who I thought was just adorable) is slowly learning the virtues of accuracy as he flings his forks.  He has some of my favorite lines in the whole film. (""May the forks be with us!""  ""Let's get the fork out of here."")I know this probably isn't the most coherent review; it's my first on IMDB. But all in all, I thoroughly enjoyed this film and am anxious for the video to be released.  I registered my vote for 9 out of 10 stars.",Mystery Men
246,nexus6-10,A few things to consider,8,21 January 2000,"Hollywood managed to keep up it's 10 year record this past summer by cranking out another comics based film. Ever since Burton hit it big with ""Batman"" a decade ago, filmgoers have seen a hint of the best and definitely the worst of the pages to celluloid transitions.1999 brought us this one that falls somewhere in the middle. The critics and many on-line reviewers dumped ""Mystery Men"" on the scrap-heap right away but the film does have its bright spots.Please keep in mind that the film is a comedy and is certainly not supposed to be some kind of award winner. It's a film to watch for enjoyment, not deep meaning.First: the film's overall look. Burton's Gotham City in ""Batman Returns"" and Shumacher's Gotham in either of his monstrosities had to be the most overdecorated and underpopulated cities ever shown on the screen. Champion City not only looks good, but has what the others lacked: PEOPLE WALKING THE STREETS AT ALL HOURS! This was without a doubt the first thing I noticed in the theater.Second: The dialogue of the characters. Many said this was a great cast that went to waste. Fine, it's not ""Fargo"". But again, it's not supposed to be! The cast delivers lines in a very natural, flowing style throughout the film. There's no ""I speak, now you speak - let's read the script together"" feel here like in so many other comics movies.Third: The photography. Fine, Usher uses lots of fish eye and upshot. But if you have ever bothered to look at a comic book, you'll notice these kinds of angles are used quite a bit. The style matches the material.Fourth: The cast. There was not one person in the cast that got on my nerves. No Alicia Silverstone, no Wil Smith, no Milo the dog. The cast worked well together on screen and none were forced onto the audience as ""the big name"".The film has its down sides as well.After a few viewings (and especially after Usher's commentary on the DVD) you can pick out spots where heavy editing ocurred.The soundtrack gets in the way sometimes and takes away from the scenes it intends to help. I've never been one for ""hip"" soundtracks (or songs inspired by the film...).The villain doesn't do much. But at least he's not jumping around like an idiot trying to be ""over the top"".It's not a fantastic super-hero film but it's not horrible. Who knows, in 10 years or so it may go the route of a cult film. For now, if you are looking for an interesting no-brainer that slaps around the Shumacharian comic fodder we've been fed the last few years, give it a look.",Mystery Men
247,johncloke,Undiscovered gem,8,25 March 2006,"When I first saw this film in the video store I skipped past it thinking it was just another superhero flick. It strikes me that the producers even tried to make it appear like a ""serious"" superhero film - which is an amusing idea, but ultimately may be the reason its target audience is largely unaware of it.I don't remember what made me get it out, but I'm glad I did. Not a spoof exactly, but a knowing take on the Superman ""American Dream"" premise. Hank Azaria is excellent, and Ben Stiller is on top form. And if you want to see the definitive William H Macy comedy performance, this is it.Highly recommended.",Mystery Men

While it doesn't necessarily work as a whole (the plot is sketchy at best, but this is comicbookland), it's imaginative, fun and incredibly light-hearted. Worth watching if for no other reason than the superb character creations-- how can you afford to miss Geoffrey Rush as Casanova Frankenstein? Some might call it a dumb movie for smart people. Exceptionally snappy dialogue, and if you watch it more than once, you'll discover the more subtle jokes.In order to gauge my taste: I love ""Something About Mary,"" hated ""Flirting With Disaster"" and, in general, prefer ""The Ben Stiller Show"" (90s Fox TV series) to anything he's done so far in film.",Mystery Men

The whole movie makes many great satirical or spoofs of superhero movies. Look at the city's name, Champion City, classical superhero setting with a classical superhero (a joking combination of Batman and Superman ideas) Captain Amazing (how can anyone take that seriously?). Then they go on to show the second string superheroes like the Shoveler and the Blue Raja. But the real joke is their obsession with the superhero genre. For example when fighting a gang of Disco guys, William H. Macy (A God among men) even says to the one toting a pipe as a weapon ""What are you supposed to be, the Disco Plumber?"". The entire idea is summed up with the recruiting party. The whole movie just runs with the idea of how much fun can be poked at superhero movies... Even the super villain is an obvious joke, his name is Casanova Frankenstein.

As a kid watching this movie it felt good to see inadequate superheroes still trying to save the world and I related to that.

Ben Stiller's portrayal of Mr. Furious was unfunny, irritating, and ultimately pathetic.  I can't believe Geoffrey Rush agreed to do this movie - as the villain he stinks, but in fairness is given little to make his character memorable (a lousy German (?) accent and deadly fingernails?  Come on!)  Greg Kinnear as Captain Amazing was good enough to be forgettable.  As I sat in the theater watching I found myself thinking ""Nope....nope... sorry"" every time another joke or predictable visual gag played (or replayed).

To be perfectly honest, I didn't really have a good hysterical laugh until the tryout scene 45 minutes into it.  Still that doesn't mean I was disappointed.The entire movie was very entertaining.  Ben Stiller is brilliantly angry as usual.  Garofalo was just plain nuts and I loved it.  Hank Azaria was my favorite of them all.  Just listening to him speak was great.  William H. Macy was great, enough said.  Kel Mitchell was very believable in the role he played, and Paul Reubens was the funniest one of the whole bunch with his words and actions.  The special effects were mesmerizing, and certainly gave power to the bad guys who didn't have any real spunk of their own. Geoffery Rush makes a fantastic villain, but without his weapons, he wouldn't have had very much to him. I don't know if I would be afraid of a long pinky fingernail at my throat. His gang, a bunch of costumed stereotypes who did nothing but have lots of screen time close to the end.  Not threatening, just added to the great entertainment.

Kinnear's limo scene with Ricky Jay is perfect 'spoiled movie star' and he imbues his character with the right balance of comic book quality and realism to make him work.I will admit the pacing is a little off in places, and visuals are certainly very flash bang, possibly to the detriment of further characterisation, but at the end of the day, this is high concept film making - it's about the little moments ""What's Up Tiger Lily?"" - and there are so many great ones in this film to make it worth repeated viewing.",Mystery Men

Janeane Garafolo (the bowler) was also really entertaining, as was William H. Macy (Shoveler) and Hank Azaria (Blue Raja). The whole premise, about a bunch of wannabe superheroes  trying to save their beloved city when they get no recognition whatsoever, due to the overinflated and over-rated Captain Amazing (Greg Kinnear) stealing the limelight all the time...is a very original one.

The art design of the film really fights with its ironic nature.If you're a comic book fan, I recommend renting this movie, if you can find it for cheap.If you're looking for a good superhero parody, check your local listings for the cartoon 'The Tick', it spoofs comic book heroes better than Mystery Men did.",Mystery Men

272,richardroma76,One of the Funniest!,10,11 April 2003,"I have absolutely no shame in declaring that 'Mystery Men' is one of my all time favorites. There is so much going on in this movie that it requires multiple viewings to catch all of the jokes. The cast is just amazing with special accolades going out to Hank Azaria as 'the Blue Raja', Geoffrey Rush as 'Casanova Frankenstein' and who could forget Ben Stiller as 'Mr. Furious'. The look of the film is great, resembling some sort of bizarro world Gotham City with even more bizarre villains. There is also so many memorable quotes in this that I could go on and on reciting them until someone slaps me. When this was released in 1999, it opened with little fanfare and was considered a flop. That's too bad because it really is a wonderful parody of the whole superhero genre and shouldn't be missed. 10 out of 10.",Mystery Men

275,rasputin-17,Another look at heroism,10,2 October 2004,"Mystery Men, on the surface, may appear to be a simple cartoon movie, yet it is in the nuances of the roles, that the truth of the film shines. Whether it is the self referential koans of the Sphinx, or the posturing of Mr. Furious, the film remains true to itself. In an age that demands that our villains be more evil than evil, and that their inevitable comeuppance be gruesome beyond belief, Mystery Men offers us ""kinder, gentler"" non-super heroes, heroes whose only true strength comes from trusting each other and believing in themselves. A simple film for complex times. From their super non-lethal weapons (the shrink ray is perfect - I can think of some people who could use their underwear shrunk!) to the Herkimer Battle Jitney, the movie maintains its integrity, never stepping outside itself, but offering a complete realized vision of a world that could be. Well done and well acted, Mystery Men deserves a spot in everyone's DVD collection.",Mystery Men
276,schadenfreude714,Extremely Underrated,9,17 March 2005,"I saw ""Mystery Men"" on my birthday in 1999 while I was away on vacation. When I came back home, I went to see it again. Keep in mind, I was twelve, but at that time it was the coolest movie ever. I even collected the ultra-rare action figures (I have them all except for the Bowler, which is the hardest to find. They made Mr. Furious, The Shoveler, The Blue Raja, The Spleen and Captain Amazing, in case your wondering. There IS a William H. Macy action figure in existence!). I've watched it many times over the years and it still remains a favorite of mine, due mostly to fond childhood memories. It's not a perfect movie, but it definitely deserves another look and perhaps a cult following.The story: a bunch of low-level superheroes save the day. This was executed again in the mediocre, direct-to-video ""The Specials"" as well. But this is the other end of the spectrum: big budget (huge budget, almost $100 Million I think) studio comedy. Yes, the effects are overblown and the huge sets and wonderful production design are a bit much considering the plot. But don't think this as a stupid, special effects-y superhero movie--it's a PARODY. They fight a villain named Cassanova Frankenstein, people. He has a psychofrakulator, whatever that is (it's a doomsday device, he'll take over the world, yada yada.) And resident superhero Captain Amazing (a Zapp Brannigan-esque Greg Kinnear, with commercial-product-logos on his costume, nice touch) is kidnapped. Time for the Mystery Men: Mr. Furious (Ben Stiller, gets mad), The Shoveller (William H. Macy, beats people with shovels), The Blue Raja (Hank Azaria, British, throws forks), The Bowler (Janeane Garafolo, bowls), Invisible Boy (Kel Mitchell, guess what he does), The Spleen (the great Paul Reubens, farts), and The Sphinx (Wes Studi, cuts guns in half with his mind, I am not kidding). The rest of the fantastic cast of character actors includes Geoffrey Rush as Cassanova, Lena Olin heavily edited out as Cassanova's bride, and the one and only Tom Waits as a crazy weapons dealer. So...with Macy, Kinnear, Olin, and Rush there are four Oscar-nominees (and one winner) and Tom freakin' Waits! It's not perfect though. It's overlong and there are some gushes of corniness here and there (The Shoveller's full of them).The dialogue definitely outweighs the physical comedy, which is sometimes lacking (there's a guy who farts for his power, case closed). The dialogue is definitely a highlight, the cyclical ramblings of the Sphinx, the mixed metaphors of Mr. Furious, etc. It's downright a funny movie, (it will almost make you forget that this was the film that let ""All Star"" by Smashmouth out into the world.) Unfortunately, the film did not do as well with critics and audiences as it should have. A sequel was originally planned (the film is in fact based on a comic book and characters from ""The Flaming Carrot"" comics. The Flaming Carrot was planned for the sequel I believe) but this did not do well at the box office. It could have been a hard sell, a superhero comedy with the guy from ""There's Something About Mary."" It also could have been the fact that it was released on the same day as ""The Sixth Sense""--which ended up being the biggest hit for the month of August--as well as ""The Thomas Crown Affair."" Two other misunderstood classics were released on the same crowded weekend, oddly enough--""Dick"" and ""The Iron Giant."" Critics gave MM passable reviews, but it was quickly forgotten. Sadly enough, on Comedy Central's Roast of Jerry Stiller, comedian Jeffrey Ross commented to Ben Stiller that, ""I saw 'Mystery Men' and I fired MY agent."" Ben is then seen to mouth the words, ""I should have to."" Don't listen to him. Give ""Mystery Men"" a chance.",Mystery Men
277,erikharrison,Underrated little geek out,7,18 December 2005,"""Nystery Men"" is an unpretentious little flick with a lot in it's favor. A good cast, some quirky dialog, and a director who knows when to just let his cast have a good time all add up to a fun time.""Mystery Men"" is not a genre flick in the usual sense, nor is it a Ben Stiller vehicle. It is more like ""The Mask"" except it relies on the ensemble instead of a central star. This has likely contributed to the movie's relative obscurity, and the broad dislike by a number of its viewers. You have to be willing to geek out a bit, and watch a goofy comedic ensemble at work to appreciate ""Mystery Men"".That said, a few things do not work. The love story between Ben Stiller's self conscious hero and Claire Forlani's waitress simply doesn't seem to play. Kel Mitchel is simply adequate, and though I find him hilarious, it's hard to separate the scatological (or methalogical, if you prefer) The Spleem from Paul Reuben's personal life.All in all, our motley team of untalented superheros play delightfully off of each other, and entertain more than they bore. Watch for a classic parody of every pep talk in all of film from William H Macy. It's brief, it's funny, and it is perfectly delivered, and contains the heart of ""Mystery Men""",Mystery Men

I'm not sure if I should blame this on the guy who came up with the chawawa (okay I don't know how to spell it) idea for the Taco Bell ad (he directed this mess) or the poor guy who wrote it. To blame it on the actors would be absurd, so that only leaves two people to blame in my mind. I would suggest this movie to those of you that are true Stiller or Garofalo fans simply to say that you saw it and then never see it again.

281,Devinoch,"Good but not spectacular - where is ""The Tick?""",8,10 August 1999,"All we need now is someone to translate ""The Tick"" into a full-fledged movie. In a film that is good, but not great, a killer cast is held back by a slight build up and a director who's got his eyes on way too many things at once.First, let it be said that most of the cast is great. Garofolo, Macy, Reubens, Azaria, Studi... all of them turn out fantastic performances. Stiller's is slightly (mark that word, too, slightly) flat, but it can overlooked as I consider that the screenwriter's fault and not Stiller's.A few of the earlier reviewers have nailed it on the head -- either you'll get this film and laugh pretty good, or you won't, and you didn't belong going to see it in the first place.This is a movie about second-rate superheroes, and, like ""The Tick,"" it's almost a prerequisite that you have at least a little bit of superhero knowledge. When I saw the film, there were about thirty of us laughing uncontrollably at the ""Six Million Dollar Man"" reference. The rest of the audience didn't have a clue.Me, I gotta confess that Mr. Furious finally did the one thing I'd waiting years to see - tell the ""mysterious"" guy that he's formulaic.Overall, I recommend seeing ""Mystery Men"" if you have a liking of superheroes and comedy. If not, go watch a few episodes of ""The Tick."" That'll tell you if you want to see this movie or not.

Unlike ""Something About Mary"", where you can walk into a theater and leave your brain in the lobby for two hours, yet it's not like ""The Bat Man"" series where your mind is seriously over worked why you figure plot out. With Mystery Men you need to think but not to much about what's going on. But it's horribly funny! It's got to be the funniest movie I saw since ""GhostBusters"" or ""The Zero Affect"". The cast worked beutifully as the characters they got.Ben Stiller worked perfectly as ""The ticking time bomb of terror"" Mr. Furious. Janeane Garaflo is brilliant as the sarcastic The Bowler. Hank Azaria as the Blue Raja was great with his corny British accent and silverware flinging. William H. Macy was great as the down to earth Shoveler. And the rest of the cast was great to. If your into pure smart, witty, comedies that actually has a plot, characters you can care about, and things that you can think about during the movie this is the flick for you.

I left the theater wishing that the writers had done a little bit more with the characters...developed them more, shown more of what made them superpowered...basically I wanted to see more of their ""powers"" being used.

First of all there are too many different characters for all of them to be given complex or even interesting personalities. The special effects detract from the story and are not really that special. Paul Reubens is wasted in a pathetic, juvenile role as a character who merely farts and speaks in an inaudible accent.Now onto the decent parts. William H Macy, three heavenly words, and his performance as the shoveler is pitch perfect. The sphinx is an exceptionally funny character who is only mysterious and merely spouts out the traditional mystical proverbs. Ben Stiller is very amusing as well, showing a weak character trying to make it into the big leagues of superheroes. All of the characters do, and that is an area which I found particuarly ironic. That is because all of the actors are Indie film actors trying to make it into the big leagues of Hollywood.To be honest, the reason I thought it failed at the box-office is that America doesn't get irony.All in all I loved the film, but I feel it would have worked better if more effort was put into tweaking the script rather than having unneccesary CGI landscapes and effects.",Mystery Men

I prefer to believe that there was no efford from Kinka, that the elemental cross his/her mind and said ""I cannot fail with this cast"" so gave us a poor product, with no story, no energy, no strenght but the actors one. I insist, someone else would do a wonderful piece of art with this performers, but he let Lena Olin appear in three scenes, gave a minor importance to one hell of an actor like Geoffrey Rush, and spread total liberty over the superheros putting in the same level a genious like Garofalo and a tiny secondary actor like Reubens. I only wish this would fall into good hands. It would be an excellent movie... I gave it a ten because some actors were superb, the music was great, the sound was good and the FXs were ok. But I had to cut three points because of Usher. Stiller have a lot more to give, u know?? He's another genious. And Garofalo worth the movie. A memorable scene?

No point in analyzing it; just sit back and let it roll over you. I especially like the way the rage guy faces off with the Sphynx character and how the girl hero has such thick makeup, reminding me of a pathetic adolescent who has no friends to tell her she's got it on too thick. The lack of unity, the lack of self-confidence, the bickering of these pathetic would-be heroes is so funny! And the evil characters are, if anything, even more funny. The German guy only has to open his mouth before mine is open in laughter. Those who complain that the film is full of clichés misses the point. It's the clichés more than anything that makes this film work so well. Airplane did that but Mystery Man takes it to a new level. The scene of the two in the light of the full moon, opera music swelling, while the otter...",Mystery Men

Some people just shouldn't go to comedy films. There's a lot to love about this film. It ain't a masterpiece but it mixes some subtle humour and fart gags.

Unfortunately, the road to Hell is paved with good intentions. Geoffrey Rush is absolutely WASTED in his role as super-villain ""Cassanova Frankenstein"".  One of the few redeeming qualities of the film is William H. Macy as ""The Shoveler"".  Macy succeeds where others in the cast fail:  he makes the role amusing while providing a sincerity to the character that makes it endearing as well.  Greg Kinnear also hits his mark as the sell-out superhero Captain Amazing.  Janeane Garofalo's asides to her ""father"" as the Bowler are amusing as well.  As for the rest of the cast...well, Hank Azaria does what he can to make the inane ""Blue Rajah"" character entertaining, but the rest of the cast appears wasted in their roles (for example Ben Stiller as ""Mr. Furious"").  A good effort from the cast and crew, however a poor script and less than enthralling storyline make it a hard sell.  A heartfelt shot that misses its target by a mile.",Mystery Men
312,ShadowWalkingSchemer,Good comedy with okay action.,5,31 March 2017,"Mystery Men is a parody of superhero movies. If the current plethora of serious movies are not your cup of tea, then Mystery Men might be what you need.Of the entire cast, The Shoveler, the Bowler and Blue Raja were the most memorable characters. In particular, I liked seeing the Bowler interact with her father via the bowling bowl, plus some of her lines were hilarious to listen to. 'No, the guy at the pro-shop did it.' Heck, a lot of the dialogue in the movie had me laughing. It's easily one of Mystery Men's strong points.However, the fight scenes could have been better. 'The superheroes with lame powers' premise should have been played up to ridiculous and gut-busting levels by featuring over-the-top fight sequences with said powers. They had the right idea with the Disco Boys and their interactions with the protagonists, but ultimately, I feel the opportunity for laughs was squandered with the somewhat underwhelming fights, especially the one between Mr. Furious and Casanova Frankenstein.And speaking of him, despite having a cool name, Casanova Frankenstein doesn't really do anything memorable aside from keeping Captain Amazing hostage. I mean, he's got some funny lines of dialogue, but I also wanted to see him do more villainous things with a helping of comedy thrown in. I kind of wish he had fought the Mystery Men at least once before the climax at the mansion to show the viewer how threatening he can be. Instead, we mostly see him acting kooky with other villains. I think they could have made him kooky AND powerful, like with actually threatening powers. It would have been pretty awesome to see the Mystery Men defeat a super-villain despite lacking the advantage of, well, real superpowers.I give it a 5.5/10. The comedy is the main attraction here, and it mostly delivers. The two hour runtime can feel like overkill, but MM deserves be viewed at least once.",Mystery Men

Ben Stiller was excellent as Mr. Furious, a hero whose powers come from his rage.  Hank Azaria was delightful as the fork-flinging do-gooder Blue Raja, who wears little to no blue.  Kel Mitchell, William H. Macy, and Janeane Garofalo provided wonderfully whimsical performances.  Paul Reubens delivered an offensive but hilarious performance as the Spleen, whose power came in the form of his extreme flatulence.  Any fan of comedy or comics should be entertained by this side-splitting comedy.  The film not only delivered wonderful comedy and super hero parody; it also had enough action and fighting to entertain most comics fans.",Mystery Men

I went into the theater excited as hell, and my girlfriend was doing her usual, begging me to skip my movie and go see the new Julia Robert's flick.  I shot her down on that idea really quick.  The movie started out very good with Captain Amazing doing his job as usual (you wouldn't believe how many sponsors this guy has. His outfit looks like it has been pulled off a nascar track).  The characters were very well casted for this movie especially Hank Azaria who plays the Blue Raja.  His faux-british accent is way up to par.  Janeane Garafolo does a very good job with her role too.  The best though has to be Ben Stiller who plays Mr. Furious.  In the movie he's like the last person you would expect to have  a temper but God when he let's it go you'll be rolling.  Geoffrey Rush is also pretty creepy as Cassanova Frankenstein. This is sort of an odd turn of roles for him, but he undoubtedly pulled it off.  My favorite bits were Mr. Furious listening to The Sphinx character put out these anonyms, and then watching Mr. Furious' face as he thought about them.  Overall this was a great movie but I think that the studio should have released it earlier in the summer.  Go see this movie, you won't be disappointed.",Mystery Men

But, maybe that's not saying much since I didn't expect a great deal to begin with.  Independent of my expectations, Mystery Men turned out to be fairly entertaining about half-way through the film (finally) and truly fun in the last 20 minutes.  For me, the first half was a bit slow and I struggled to get into it.  If I had to complain about one thing, it would probably be the degree of predictability in Mystery Men (maybe it should have been called Predictable Men?).

They try to actually make you laugh, instead of forcibly extracting the guffaws from your lungs with a deluge of cursing and really nasty situations. Aside from The Spleen, there's nary a toilet joke in sight. There's also little or no cursing, one character visibly restrains himself in order to say ""butt"". The one-liners are real live jokes, not formulaic insults.In Champion City, superheroes are an accepted fact of life. However, not all superheroes graduated at the top of the class. The Shoveler wields his shovel with unparalleled skill. The Blue Raja , self proclaimed master of cutlery, flings forks at enemies. The Spleen is armed with his mighty flatulence. Invisible Boy can *probably* become invisible. The Bowler is aided by a bowling ball inhabited by the spirit of her dead father. Mr. Furious gets really, really angry. The terribly mysterious Sphinx coaches the team with ""profound"" koans.But when the great Captain Amazing is captured by the recently paroled Casanova Frankenstein, it's up to our heroes to save the day. So begins the ride that is Mystery Men. The script goes after comic book cliches with a zeal that may overwhelm the movie at times, but it's all in good fun: Comic books have always been like this, and Mystery Men is the first one that refuses to take itself (or let itself be taken) seriously. It even looks like a comic book: The environments are gothic and angular while borrowing its printed brothers' glaring color. Imagine the set design of Tim Burton while drunk.The movie does have a few too many slow moments (Is there a reason for Claire Forlani to even be *in* this movie?), and might be less enjoyable to those with little knowledge of comic books (who would probably miss a few of the in-jokes).

Rather than a bunch of unified superheroes who are also a force to be reckoned with alone, the Mystery Men are a bunch of misfits who fight worse together than alone, and they are pathetic when they fight alone.First, I can see how the movie bombed.  The maturity level needed for much of the humor in the movie is far too high for almost everyone in the world, so the jokes definitely went right over most people's heads.  The fighting/action was less than stellar when compared to something like X-men. The characters could be annoying at times, and many lacked depth, unlike all of the other traditional superheroes.But while all of those points could be viewed as a negative, they made the movie even better for me.  It was great to see superheroes get in dumb little arguments (like the Bowler's and Mr. Furious' frequent stare downs). Then the characters and their respective powers themselves were hilarious. The Shoveller was kind of normal and the Sphinx's mysterious powers were just coming up with incredibly deep statements, but the rest were great. The Blue Raja who wields the deadly forks (well, they do have points on them); the Spleen (nothing needs to be said about him); the Invisible Boy who is only invisible when no one looks at him; the Bowler who talks to her dad's skull, which is located in a bowling ball.  The corporate spokesmen sellout Captain Amazing was amazing as well, skillfully portraying the loved superhero while not really caring about his fans unless it is bringing him more corporate sponsors.  No one (except Mr. Furious) believed that Captain Amazing was billionaire Lance Hunt because ""Lance wears glasses.  Captain Amazing doesn't wear glasses.""  Ben Stiller's Mr. Furious character is by far the best and funniest character in the movie.  When he raises his arms, you expect some impressive display of strength, but all he manages to do is get beat up and fail to take a decal off of a car.There was no single feature (dialogue, story, action, comedy, etc.) that stood out as excellent, but all of the pieces combined to make Mystery Men a delightful movie and a member of my DVD collection.

It has a couple of clever lines but immediately in the first scene of the film you start to wonder if the writer(s) were still in middle school. The jokes are often random and go off on a tangent. I suffered through it hoping it might end with at least one good laugh. I felt so bad for leaving this on while my wife was in the room I immediately cooked her dinner and dessert and admitted that it was truly one of the most painful films i've ever seen (up there with catwoman i'd say). On the upside if you like movies like ""dude, wheres my car"" and ""spy kids"", then you'll love this heaping pile of dung.",Mystery Men
349,kyle-151,gets better with age,10,30 May 2005,"This is a great movie. I love it more each time i watch. Most comedies can get pretty lame because you know all the gags, but mystery men has so much integrity in the writing and characterization that watching once again -- as Ben Stiller tears at the hood ornament of the limo, or Hank Azaria says good-bye to Louise Lasser, or Geoffrey Rush flashes his fuhrer choreography, or Tom Waits mumbles while he watches the news report, or Janeane Garofalo refuses a kiss from Paul Reubens -- is a pleasure. This is pitch perfect ensemble acting. The story develops directly and consistently, the action sequences are creative and not too dominant, all the set-ups payoff by the end. Seriously, if you've seen it and it's been a while, watch it again, and if you haven't then get started. You can't watch it again until you've seen it the first time. (Wes Studi, William H. Macy, the tryouts scene. Too much good stuff!)",Mystery Men
350,krisvad,More hero than super,9,13 April 2005,"A film about wannabee's, never-were's and less-than-heroes making it against all odds. Where have we heard that before. But when the unfortunates are the Shoveller, the Blue Raja and Mr.Furious you know this is not your conventional rags to riches story.A classic performance by Eddie Izzard as Tony P. one of the Disco boys leaders and Geoffrey Rush as Arch Villain shows actual thought went into the casting. Even Greg Kinnear, at first glance an odd choice for the role of Captain Amazing turns out spot on.Watch this film if you're sick of comic-gone-film stereotypes. Why couldn't anger be a super power?",Mystery Men
351,marshmellowDIE,LOVED it.,9,30 June 2005,"This movie was a brilliant concept. It was original, cleverly written and of high appeal to those of us who aren't really 'conformist' movie pickers. Don't get me wrong - there are some great movies that have wide appeal, but when you move into watching a movie based on ""everyone else is watching it"" - you know you're either a tween or don't really have an opinion. This had a lovely subtle humor - despite most people probably looking only at the obvious. The actors portrayed their characters with aplomb and I thought there was a lot more ""personal"" personality in this film. Has appeal for kids, as well as adults. Esp. nice to find a good movie that's not filled with sexual references and drug innuendos! A great film, not to be overlooked based on public consumption. This one is a must buy.",Mystery Men

353,friggindemon,I love this movie!^_^,10,29 August 2005,"I saw this in theaters and absolutely adored it. Geoffery Rush gave the best performance as a super villain that I have ever seen since Gene Hackman as Lex Luther. Kel Mitchel and Paul Rubens were a match maid in heaven. This film also introduced me to William H. Macy, who is now one of my favorite actors. Hank was great as the Blue Raja, and I especially loved that the character wasn't really British. The scene with him and telling his mom that he was a superhero almost brought tears to my eyes. I loved the fact that The Bowler talked to the ball. Some of the funniest stuff involved Stiller and his character Mr. Furious's false rage, and the fact that his threats and one-liners were all gibberish, and that they never made any sense. I could barely stop myself from applauding when he said ""fraculater, Freinken-puss,"" was said. But one of the things I most enjoyed was that Captain Amazing actually dies in the movie. I HIGHLY recommend this film for any occasion, and I give it my own personal two-thumbs-up.",Mystery Men
