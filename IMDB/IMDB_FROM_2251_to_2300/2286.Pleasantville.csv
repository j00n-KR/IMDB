0,MartinHafer,Don Knotts is magic...,8,23 March 2010,"Tobey Maguire and Reese Witherspoon play brother and sister who are high school students in the present day (though they were 23 and 22 when they made the film). While you have no idea WHY, Don Knotts (yes, Don Knotts!) plays a magical TV repairman who gives them a bizarre looking remote that somehow transports them into a TV show that Tobey loves--""Pleasantville"". They have no idea why this occurred or if it will ever end or if Knotts is god, but oddly neither questions this new world that is literally in black & white like an old episode of ""Father Knows Best"". However, unwittingly, their presence with their modern sensibilities and notions causes this seemingly idyllic world to start to slowly come apart at the seems. Notions such as freedom to choose, sex and individuality are missing in this world--and the two interlopers bring this to the plastic world of Pleasantville.By the way, Pleasantville is odd in many ways. First, all roads in town lead right back to town and no one has ever left the town or knows anything about the world outside. Second, books are blank inside and the people have no idea about what they contain. Third, when there is a fire, the fire department actually has no idea WHAT a fire is--they are only used to things you might see in the TV world--such as rescuing cats stuck in trees. In fact, how Tobey is able to finally convince the firemen to come to his house when there is an actual fire is pretty funny. There's a lot more that is strange about the town and it gets stranger when the influence of the two outsiders slowly causes actual colors to begin appearing in the monochrome world.The film is a strange surreal sort of thing that is truly unique. Using colorization techniques, they are able to achieve amazing results that seem to jump off the screen. It's all a metaphor about how the idyllic life of 50s TV was actually quite stilted and repressive, though Maquire and Witherspoon's life in the real world isn't exactly great either--their parents are divorced and Witherspoon is, to put it nicely, a bit shallow and slutty. A happy medium would sure be nice--combining the best of both worlds--and I think this is a valid interpretation of the film's intent. Where exactly it all goes and the unexpected consequences are something you'll just have to learn about yourself, so watch the film.Overall, a rather interesting and innovative film. It was nominated for three Oscars and deserved kudos in these departments--for sets, costume design and music. While I wouldn't put it in the category of must-see, it is interesting and worth seeing--even if the ending is a bit too drawn out in some ways. The only real misgiving I have is the way SOME might see the film and come to the conclusions that the 1950s were all bad and repressive--a rather oversimplification of the era, to say the least. This era, like all in our history, had its good and bad points and I worry that such a revisionist view of our past will be believed by young people seeing this movie--especially since films such as this are the only way most teens get their history. I know, as I've taught US and World History--kids are THAT gullible...really. I can't really blame the folks from ""Pleasantville"" for this lack of awareness in teens, but it did concern me as I watched the film.By the way, one thing I liked about the film was the courtroom scene and William Macy's acting. While he said very, very little, his face showed so much expression--now THAT'S acting!",Pleasantville
1,bkoganbing,"The Color Of Life, The Joy Of Life Is It's Diversity",10,6 March 2008,"One of the most charming fantasies ever put on film was what Gary Ross did in the film Pleasantville. It's subtle message about tolerance for diversity ought to be required viewing for those of us who make public policy and influence public opinion.Television of the Fifties seems to have fashioned an image of the American family that permeates our political views and social mores right down to today. Not that families were any better or worse during the Fifties, but the image that television created with families from Ozzie and Harriet, Leave It To Beaver, Father Knows Best, right through to the Brady Bunch seem to set impossible standards. Including a favorite of mine, the Donna Reed Show which I believe was the model for the Parker family in Pleasantville. Starting with your's truly, I don't know anyone who had an upbringing like in a TV family.Tobey Maguire and Reese Witherspoon play a pair of current teens who don't have the greatest of home lives. Maguire is a nerdy kid and Witherspoon is a very serious version of Kelly Bundy who thinks if she sleeps around, she'll be popular and hasn't much interest in education.One night while Witherspoon is running late for a date and Maguire is getting ready for a marathon showing of the popular Fifties family comedy Pleasantville the remote breaks down. As if by magic, a TV repairman played by Don Knotts shows up with a very special remote. As Witherspoon and Maguire fight over the remote by magic they are transported into the television set and become part of the self contained universe of Pleasantville. Oh, and they are in black and white as the show was taped back in the day. So with their new identities from the teenage kids of the Parker family with ideal mom and dad Joan Allen and William H. Macy, Maguire and Witherspoon seek to adjust to a new life in television land. But just the introduction of these two into this well ordered universe changes things, first in the most subtle ways and then as both realize the problems with this world in more direct ways. As the change comes, color comes slowly creeping into the black and white images. Pleasantville got Oscar nominations for Art&Set Design, Original Score, and Costume Design unfortunately not winning any. However it won Saturn Awards for Tobey Maguire and Joan Allen for Best Actor and Supporting Actress in a Science Fiction film. I prefer to think of it as a fantasy rather than a science fiction film, though I can see that science fiction certainly influenced the creation. It combines the best elements of a Star Trek TNG pair of episodes involving Data and LeForge with a holodeck character based on Professor Moriarty and how he's dealt with and an original episode involving Kirk and Spock and some of the rest of the crew landing on a planet where the philosophy of a former sage named Landru is enforced vigorously. There's a bit of the Stepford Wives here as well.In fact in the role of the head of the Pleasantville Men's Association is J.T. Walsh in a farewell performance. Such things that don't fit his ideas and those of an influential few are just not permitted in their paradise. Pleasantville is also the last big screen appearance of Don Knotts, an interesting choice for the TV repairman as he was a regular on the most wholesome Andy Griffith Show.Pleasantville is one of the best films of the last decade of the last century. It illustrates that humanity's real strength is in its diversity and how we respect that diversity. It's what brings out the best in the human character, in the human spirit.",Pleasantville
2,SnoopyStyle,cute gimmick turns funny turns profound,8,27 August 2015,"David (Tobey Maguire) is a geek in high school. Real life is diminishing expectations, family divorce and no female companionship. He's obsessed with an old TV show Pleasantville. While watching a Pleasantville marathon, he has a fight with his twin sister Jennifer (Reese Witherspoon) and they break the TV remote. TV repairman (Don Knotts) shows up and give them a special remote which sends them into the show. They become George (William H. Macy) and Betty Parker (Joan Allen)'s kids Bud and Mary Sue. She's not happy until she sees her new boyfriend Skip Martin (Paul Walker). Bud is working at Bill Johnson (Jeff Daniels)'s soda shop. He falls for Margaret Henderson (Marley Shelton). The kids' interactions start changing the strange purity of Pleasantville and colors seeps into the world.At first, this is a gimmick that has some cute aspects. Don Knotts adds to that sense of a cheap laugh. It has some good fun with Maguire and Witherspoon budding head. Then the deeper profound message seeps into the movie. It is gentle and yet undeniable. A couple of times, I feared the movie would push too hard like calling the people ""color"". It manages to maintain some distance and follow through on the message without overpowering it. This is quite a film.",Pleasantville
3,Hitchcoc,"Give a Whole New Meaning to ""Colored Folk""",8,5 January 2017,"I enjoyed the creativity of this film. It gives us a look at what a shallow view of the world the ""Good Old Days"" is. There were no good old days. They were good days for people whose lives were financially stable or who did not face prejudice or benefited from being viewed correctly by the populace. When the kids pass into Pleasantville, they come upon a TV world of 50's and 60's sitcoms where everything is vanilla (actually black and white). As the kids begin to sow their oats and the fabrics of this fantasy world begins to buckle, people who rebel or move against the status quo start to become brightly colored. When teen sex and other acts of rebellion begin to be embraced, there is more color. This is a provocative film. What I take issue with is something like a religion taking over a society to show it what is right. While those in the religious group think that what they are doing to other is correct, who are they to know? Some of the things that are taken in by the people of Pleasantville could be seen as anathema to their world and instead of an improvement, they may be destructive. However, this is not the total message because once back in the ""real"" contemporary world, there is still pain and sadness from the very issues that were foisted on the imaginary town.",Pleasantville
4,kosmasp,In jokes,8,29 April 2020,"As in being in on the joke ... no pun intended. And maybe some of the things will feel more relevant to some than to others. People who cherished certain tv shows and are aware of cliches. Also what a cast this has! Incredible and it shows in the final product.So while cliches may be torn down, some others may be satisfied in the same breath. So yes this is not flawless. But it is funny, while predictable, driven and with a clear aim/message. There are portions in black and white, which may shock and bewilder some - maybe even annoy viewers. But bear with it and you'll something uplifting overall and something that may be nice to see (even for cynics I reckon)",Pleasantville
5,classicsoncall,"""TV time! Remember, you're soaking in it!""",8,26 January 2014,"It's difficult to find movies with a completely novel concept one hasn't seen before, so in that sense, ""Pleasantville"" is one of the more original films you're likely to come across. Occasionally other pictures rely on the black and white/color dichotomy, but this one does so to present an interesting idea. When a person steps outside of their normal comfort zone in the picture, they transform from black and white into color. The concept is then turned on it's head when the majority (the b&w) start to turn on those who have experienced something new (the coloreds). I don't know if that was supposed to be an overt comment on racism or not, but I got that impression, similar to the way the issue of race was handled in the Loki episode of 'Star Trek' back in the 'real' Sixties.It was also pretty cool to see one of the Sixties' most memorable character actors, Don Knotts, in the role of the TV repairman. I'm glad they had his personality toned down as opposed to the brainless deputy Barney Fife he portrayed on the ""Andy Griffith Show"". What a neat way to make the transition from the 1998 (then) present to the decades earlier past. Reading some of the other reviews posted on this board, it's kind of comical to me to see how young present day viewers interpret a past they hadn't lived through and which they can't fully understand. Entertainment media in all forms has undergone a gradual transition over time and what once were taboo subjects for TV like the word 'pregnant', are almost unimaginable with the way anything goes nowadays. I'm reminded of my own son when he was only about eight years old asking me if when I was a kid, did everything exist in only black and white.",Pleasantville
6,gavin6942,Brilliant,8,13 April 2015,"Two 1990s teenagers find themselves in a 1950s sitcom where their influence begins to profoundly change that complacent world.This is a surprisingly strong role for Reese Witherspoon, who tends to be an overrated actress. If anything, she is actually underrated here for how well she made Jenny her own character. The appearance of Don Knotts is a great touch, and William H. Macy is wonderful as always.While a simple concept (kids getting sucked into the TV), the execution is a work of genius. Writer-director Gary Ross used this backdrop to explore race relations, the ""good old days"", changing cultures and mores... and exploring a range of ""right and wrong"". And underneath it all, it still remains a sense of humor and does not attempt to guilt trip the audience.",Pleasantville
7,lee_eisenberg,"Don Knotts, RIP",9,25 February 2006,"Don Knotts's death yesterday brings to mind his various roles. ""Pleasantville"" probably wasn't his most famous movie, but it's one that I would recommend to everyone. It portrays real-life teenagers David (Tobey Maguire) and Jennifer (Reese Witherspoon) getting transferred into a 1950's ""Leave It to Beaver""-style TV show. Aside from the fact that everything is black-and-white, David and Jennifer (now called Bud and Mary Sue in the show) have a hard time adjusting to a world of wives wearing fluffy dresses all day and gray flannel suit-clad husbands saying ""Honey, I'm home!"" But David and Jennifer's presence just might change everything.All that I can say is that it would sure be neat to experience this movie. More than just a goofy story, there's a clear reference to racism as colors start showing and everything starts changing. And the way that they use the song ""Take Five"" is also quite eye-opening. Great performances from the aforementioned cast members, plus Joan Allen, William H. Macy, Jeff Daniels, J.T. Walsh (in his final role), and even Jane Kaczmarek right before she got the role of Lois on ""Malcolm in the Middle"", make this one cool movie.",Pleasantville
8,jboothmillard,Pleasantville,7,19 September 2005,"When I first heard of this I thought it was some kind of horror film, but in fact it turned out to be an interesting drama comedy. Basically David (Tobey Maguire) and Jennifer (Reese Witherspoon) are fans of a popular TV show called Pleasantville and have a small fantasy together of being in a peaceful world like in the show. No arguments, no despair, just happy family life. When they get their wish granted by some unknown magic on the TV, they don't exactly approve at first. They have to get used to being part of the Parker family, George (the very good William H. Macy) and Betty (Joan Allen). After a little while of being in the TV show they start to effect the TV show being black and white. Because they are using emotions and actions that aren't usually in the show, other characters are and the town is starting to turn colourful because of it. Also starring Jeff Daniels as Mr. Johnson. It was nominated the Oscars for Best Art Direction-Set Decoration, Best Costume Design and Best Music for Randy Newman. Very good!",Pleasantville
9,rmax304823,People of Color,6,24 September 2002,"I didn't know where this movie was going from one minute to the next. It could have been written by Rod Serling while possessed by a Dybbuk. It has touches of ""A Short Walk"" and ""A Stop in Willoughby"" in it. But Serling, brought up in Binghamton, New York, usually saw the past as something regrettably lost. A kind of cultural childhood, a Golden Age, a period of innocence, rather like Spielberg. What are we to make of the clash of values that Bud and Mary Sue bring back to 1958 with them? Bud is happy enough to be in the black and white world of stability. (Stability? I mean obsessive-compulsive rigidity.) But Mary Sue runs around like a warthog in heat with nothing in her head except whatever impinges on her body sheath. And then there's this colorization gimmick. People change colors as they, well, ""evolve"" maybe. The kids' mother has her first orgasm (self induced) and a tree on the lawn bursts into colorful flame. She turns colored. Mary Sue begins to wonder, since she's been rutting with all the young studs in town, why she remains black and white, and Bud suggests that maybe it's not just the sex. Well then what IS it? It's not simply the capacity for change because Bud's already got his dose. At one point Bud tells a townsman that people get colorized because of something human inside them, something trying to get out, and he demonstrates his point by enraging the mayor (great performance by J. T. Walsh). But something has been trying to get out of the local soda fountain manager, Jeff Daniels, for a long time -- the desire to paint modern pictures a la Picasso -- and it finally does, but he remains black and white for a long time afterward. Cars turn color too, although something has been getting out of them fairly often. I'm stumped. Some of the incidents seem no more than arbitrary.The clash of cultures is interesting though. It's easy to make fun of the 1950s from our current perspective and this movie, unlike Twilight Zone, milks it for laughs. Married couples sleep in separate twin beds and never have sex. (They pollinate, I suppose.) Young couples go to Lover's Lane -- to hold hands. The books in the library are all blank because nobody reads or knows anything about life outside of Pleasantville. That last is a cheap shot, and untrue. Mary Sue, of all people, introduces them to reading and studying, and the books magically fill up with text and engravings. And it's a weak argument that claims we read more now than in 1958.Well, the two kids wind up colorizing everything and everybody and practically wrecking the town in the process. It's supposed to be an improvement, but is it? The black and white townsfolk were dumb but happy. Now they get into fights, insult one another, trash art works they don't like. They screw like minks before they're married. One can imagine what this does to the crime rate and the teenage pregnancy rate -- and taxes. (Is this what been trying to get out of them?) Sure, it was oppressive in the 1950s. We can see that now -- all that conformism and complacency. Is it less oppressive now? Perhaps not. Perhaps we don't recognize the strictures we live under because we take them for granted. We may be in the same position as the guy Mark Twain mentioned who suddenly realized he'd been speaking prose all his life. From inside the box, the commonly accepted assumptions, we seem to have a good deal of freedom to do what we want. The good folk of Pleasantville felt the same way -- and this movie treat them as airheads.I want to mention something about the score. It insinuates anachronistically Dave Brubeck's ""Take Five"" into one of the scenes, rather prominently. This is followed, again anachronistically, by a piece from an album I revere, Miles Davis's ""So What."" I'm glad that it wasn't drilled into the viewers' ears in 1958 because it's unforgettable. How easily it could have become a stock piece, like R. Strauss's ""Also Sprach Zarathustra"" from ""2001: A Space Odyssey,"" or the last movement from Beethoven's Ninth Symphony. I can almost hear it now, playing over and over and over on all kinds of TV commercials for shampoo, kitchen cleansers, pimple removers, and condoms. It may be hard to tell but I kind of enjoyed the movie, although it left me as much puzzled as satisfied. Joan Allen's performance is the only one with true depth; Macy is always interesting but his part gives him less to do. The kids are routine, except for the momentous 1950s bosom Reese Witherspoon has to strap on. Jeff Daniels fits his role as a reasonable but timid person very well. The only role in which I can remember his displaying energy was that of Joshua Chamberlain in ""Gettysburg."" Rod Serling didn't always have a perfect answer for his longing for the past either, but I usually felt it was the result of ambivalence on his part, not, as here, confusion.",Pleasantville
10,Tweekums,When two '90s kids get zapped into a swell '50s sitcom world nothing will be the same again,8,29 August 2017,"David and Jennifer Wagner are fairly ordinary '90s teens growing up in an ordinary Californian suburb. He is a little bit square; watching reruns of 'Pleasantville', a '50s sitcom, while she is more interested in having a good time with her date. Then something strange happens; one evening they fight over the TV remote and it gets broken and without the remote the set won't work; moments later the repairman appears at the door and gives them a new 'more powerful' remote. Once again they argue and when the TV is switched on they find themselves in Pleasantville.Pleasantville is one of those perfect towns that only exist in TV shows of a certain vintage; everything is just swell, the dinner is always on the table when father gets home, the weather is always sunny and the home team always wins also it is in black and white, there may be children but there is no knowledge of sex, all the books are blank and there is no 'outside of town'. It turns out the TV repairman thought this would be a real treat for David he is a little upset when David and Jennifer demand to return home and storms off telling them he might be back in a week. David things they should just play along but Jennifer isn't so keen to change her ways. It isn't long before their actions are changing Pleasantville. Before their arrival boys and girls would date for quite a while before holding hands; Jennifer takes the captain of the basketball team on a date and shows him that there is more they can do than just hold hands. Soon after strange things start to happen; there are splashes of colour here and there, the team starts to lose and it even rains. Some of the inhabitants welcome the changes and the awakening of feelings and desires they never knew existed; these people become coloured. Others are determined that Pleasantville must remain pleasant and they remain monochrome. It isn't just the town that is changing; David becomes a little less square and Jennifer discovers the she might just enjoy a good book as much as going out on a date.This is a delightful film; for the most part it is subtle with gradual changes to the characters as things progress. There are funny moments as well as some touching ones. I liked how Pleasantville was an almost sickly sweet cliché of a '50s sitcom there aren't even toilets as nobody would be seen needing to go to the lavatory in such programmes! The ending where those who want things to stay as they are fight back and there are 'No Coloreds' signs and book burnings is a little heavy handed but not enough to spoil ones enjoyment of the film. The characters developed nicely throughout the film leading to an ending that would have seemed unlikely early on but was just right by the time we got to the end. Tobey Maguire and Reese Witherspoon do fine jobs as David and Jenifer and are ably supported by a fine cast; notably Joan Allen and William H. Macy as their 'parents', Jeff Daniels as David's art-loving boss and J. T. Walsh as the town's rather reactionary mayor. The special effects as colour gradually seeps into Pleasantville are really good; with shades that look more like early colour photographs than real colours. Overall I'd certainly recommend this; it is a lot of fun and for the most part subtle and reminds us that the 'good old days', even as depicted on television, were far from perfect.",Pleasantville
11,moonspinner55,"Inconsistently developed, but clever, magical and amusing",7,17 September 2002,"Once they magically enter the black-and-white world of a 1950s TV sitcom, squabbling siblings Reese Witherspoon and the ingratiating Tobey Maguire instinctively bring with them their '90s sensibilities, which causes havoc and miracles. Strange though that the residents of Pleasantville are immune to miracles. Gary Ross's writing seems to skip over these developments in order to push the plot forward, but I would rather ponder the details. When Maguire tells a slick-haired teen tough to ""get the hell outta here"", the kid doesn't even react to word 'hell'. Has the town--by this point--become that jaded already? Still, flaws and all, I really enjoyed the idea here, and Ross as a director gets fabulous performances from everyone, particularly Witherspoon (who, up to this point, had left me cold). Not the fluffball, fish-out-of-water comedy I was expecting. A lot of thought went into this, and a lot of emotion comes out. *** from ****",Pleasantville
12,blanche-2,Kids from the real world fall into a TV one,7,27 January 2007,"1998's ""Pleasantville"" is an interesting film with a great concept that somehow doesn't come off. It seems like a simple story at first but as the plot deepens, the film becomes unwieldy though fascinating in sections.Tobey Macguire is David, a teenager who is looking forward to a marathon of his favorite TV show, ""Pleasantville,"" a '50s comedy similar to any that baby boomers grew up with. When an unsolicited TV repairman (Don Knotts) appears, he leaves David a special remote. David manages to zap himself and his sister Jennifer (Reese Witherspoon) into the black and white world of Pleasantville. David warns Jennifer that they cannot do anything out of character for the town. However, being modern teens, they are not in step with the people of Pleasantville and sure enough, the TV town begins to change...from black and white to color.What makes ""Pleasantville"" the movie a fun experience is that everyone seems to have a different interpretation of what, for instance, the color means, and the message of the film. I can only give my own impressions. For some, the film promotes sexual promiscuity. As the kids become more sexually active, led by Jennifer, and turn into color characters, they are then faced with sexually transmitted diseases and become objects of prejudice, black and white versus colored. Get it? Then pages that were blank in books are filled in as Jennifer and David tell the stories of Huck Finn et al., which causes books to be burned.For me the color wasn't equal to sexual promiscuity but to emotional life. And what the movie was trying to say for me is that the black and white world of the Pleasantville TV show only existed on television. There were enlightened people in the '50s and plenty of dysfunctional families and illegitimate babies, so someone was having sex; television just didn't show them. TV did mirror much of society, but people have been people through the ages even if the identities men and women have in our culture has changed. Jennifer is a sexually promiscuous teen; in Pleasantville, she starts reading and studying and understands that there's a lot more to life. David's TV dad (Bill Macy) realizes that he loves his wife (Joan Allen) even if she doesn't have dinner on the table at 6 p.m. every evening.I found ""Pleasantville"" absorbing but something was a little off-kilter about its execution. Perhaps it was in the set-up of David and Jennifer winding up in Pleasantville, which initially made it seem that the film was going to be a wacky comedy. Despite fine performances from Bill Macy, Jeff Daniels as a coffee shop owner/frustrated artist, Joan Allen, Knotts, Witherspoon, and Maguire, in the end, ""Pleasantville"" bit off a little more than it could chew.",Pleasantville
13,Coventry,errr...it was cute !,4,16 November 2003,"I have this pretty long list of movies that I keep on delaying to see. Pleasantville was one of them and, actually, most other movies on that list fit in the same category as Pleasantville when it comes to style, plot and moral. I just fear that they'll bore me and overload me with a bunch of unnecessary sentiment and feel-good stuff. Pleasantville came on TV the other night and I finally decided to give it a shot. After all, I see all the recommendations and the praising on this site and I thought I may have been a bit too prejudiced and negative about it.... Well, I guess I wasn't. I got what I suspected, and though I'm NOT at all saying it's a bad movie ... it really isn't my style. I admit there are a lot of original, funny and even good aspects about this production but overall it's just too forced. You can actually hear the director and producers think: "" Oh, this is the scene where the audience will cry and hug each other"". I don't like that...it really suffers from a lack of surprise and spontaneity. Also, the cast suffers from a real bad case of typecasting. It's full of great names but they are play the roles we've seen them playing multiple times before. I guess Tobey Maguire is doomed to play the dorky boy, and it's pretty obvious that Reese Witherspoon isn't going to get rid of the ""dumb bimbo"" status in the near future> neither. Once again, Jeff Daniels plays the modest loser and J.T Walsh is the angry icon of authority...again. As usual, they give away outstanding performances ( not a bad word about that ) but we've seen it by now. The thing that annoyed me the most is the explicit and overused moral behind this movie: If you ignore or deny your deepest feelings, you suck away the color out of your life...yeah yeah, we get it now...move on!!Well, I better start naming some aspects of which I thought they were good. Otherwise I'm going to face a lot of angry comments and messages again... The basic plot idea of Pleasantville is really good. The story is well thought true and there's enough humor and inspiration to keep you watching. Even though you know what will happen at the end, you keep staring at the developing of the story. The atmosphere of the 50's was really good as well, though I hoped for a bit more of typical juke-box music. Some sequences are really funny bring a naughty grin on your face. Like for example the part where the daughter teaches her 'mother' all about the secrets of masturbation... I really laughed with that. Pleasantville certainly isn't a waste of your time, but there are much better titles out there to discover. On the other hand, it could be a great suggestion to watch when you're with your girlfriend / boyfriend ... cute hugs and kisses garantueed...but that's just the way how the makers intended it to be.",Pleasantville
14,michaelRokeefe,A journey like no other.,6,12 January 2004,"Pure joy to watch this enlightening fantasy. Two modern teens(Reese Witherspoon and Tobey Maguire)cause a stir when transported to Pleasantville USA where life is just like a black & white 50s TV sitcom. The effective use of DeLuxe color blending with black and white takes on a character of its own and helps enlighten views on independence, bigotry, liberalism, sex, censorship and even rock & roll. The small town begins to change, but not all of the townsfolk are happy with the changes. Change and ""color"" come slowly. The soundtrack is great...featuring the music of Dave Brubeck, Gene Vincent, Etta James, Buddy Holly and Elvis. The more than apt cast includes: William H. Macy, Joan Allen, J.T. Walsh and Jeff Daniels. Kudos to writer and director Gary Ross.",Pleasantville
15,LeonLouisRicci,Fantastic Modern Fairy-Tale,10,2 July 2013,"A lot of Folks have a knee-jerk reaction to this completely original Movie that satirically tackles a common conundrum...is it better to have complete Freedom or how much restraint and restrictions do we really need?Some miss the point. It is not that change is better for the People of Pleasantville, change is necessary. Because literally nothing ever happens there. They are stuck in a loop of repetitiveness and repression. A stilted Utopia where a team never loses and daily routines are never ever changed one bit. Its not that they need complete Freedom, they need some choices. To be able to read diversified thought, see Artistic representations and expressions and get in touch with their inner feelings.To leave Pleasantville the way it was would be cruel to the extreme.This is a wonderful and touching Movie with great Artistic touches and fine Performances all around. It handles its Philosophy and Premise quite well and is a hoot. One of the best Films of the Nineties and a treat for those willing to give its due without leaping to Religious and Social Ideology. This is just a fantastic modern Fairy-Tale and a dazzling piece of thoughtful Entertainment.",Pleasantville
16,Boba_Fett1138,So many missed opportunities but yet it delivers,8,17 January 2004,"""Pleasantville"" is an excellent movie but with such an unique story you would expect more interesting elements.The movie has an high entertainment and feel good value which is thanks to the nice and special atmosphere of Pleasantville which is a world on it's own where everything is pleasant and seems perfect. The 50's atmosphere of it is simply wonderful.The story is a bit lame and easy at times and filled with some plot holes but however it doesn't take away the fun from the movie. Still it's a shame that they didn't used some more interesting elements that easily could have been used for the movie. There are some serious missed opportunities. Still the story has some great elements and moments that are at times almost magical also thanks to the wonderful musical score by Randy Newman. The story also has some nice references to the bible and even the WW II Nazi regime.The cast is good, especially the male cast of which I especially will mention; Jeff Daniels, William H. Macy and last but definitely not least; J.T. Walsh in an enjoyable role as mayor of Pleasantville, which was one of his last roles before his sudden death in early 1998.As last I want to mention the subtle special effects that were quite good and unique especially for 1998 standards. An enjoyable movie!8/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",Pleasantville
17,view_and_review,Two kids ruin paradise,8,2 March 2007,"""Pleasantville"" is one of those movies that you here people say: ""I just happen to catch this and it was good."" I was locked in while watching ""Pleasantville"", and after watching it I was trying to think why I liked it so much. There was no action, there wasn't any particularly great acting, but there was definitely something appealing about the movie.Well after giving some thought, I realized that it was good because watching Pleasantville go from black & white to color was like watching a child come of age. The movie began with two teenagers from the late '90s being warped into a television town from the '50s known as Pleasantville. The town is just like the name indicates, it is pleasant. The town, and everyone in it, is black and white, everyone is always chipper, and the high school basketball team never loses.Eventually, things start to become colorized, and the town starts to go in an uproar. As characters in the town began to find feelings of passion, lust, anger, desire, and other feelings that lead to immoral behavior, they turned from black & white to color.Pleasantville was a town that just about everyone would love to live in but nobody does. Pleasantville was more than just a perfect town, it was a perfect existence. There was no crime, poverty, or problems. Everyone was happy, polite, and swell. Even though we would all like to live there, we don't want to see it on television. People like to watch programs that are closer to real life, where there are issues, problems, and bad habits; and where the emotions have a wider spectrum than just 'swell' or 'sore'. Now, we are not sadistic, in that we just want to see others suffer, but on the contrary, we want to see those issues, problems, and bad habits overcome. Pleasantville offered none of that until David (Tobey Maguire) and Jennifer (Reese Witherspoon) showed up.As the town experienced new and foreign feelings, they also gained color one by one. As each person became hued, the basketball team started losing, the mens' dinners weren't ready, and controversial books got words. It was interesting to see the transformation of the small ""Leave it to Beaver"" town if for no other reason than the town became more normal.",Pleasantville
18,evanston_dad,"Premise Is Great, But Couldn't Someone Else Have Directed This?",6,22 June 2010,"A fabulous premise is undermined by Gary Ross's cavity-inducing tendency toward syrupy sentimentality.Two modern-day teens (Tobey Maguire and Reese Witherspoon) are magically transplanted into a perfect and perfectly oppressed small town in the 1950s. Once there, they begin to awaken in the townsfolk yearnings and ideas that haven't yet occurred to them. The film's gimmick, and it's a great one, is that the 1950s portions are filmed in black and white that begins slowly to turn to color as the town begins to blossom.The production design alone is interesting enough to make the film worth sitting through, and thank God for that, because director Gary Ross certainly doesn't do his part to help. A graduate of the Ron Howard school of film directing, he thinks every thought and emotion in a film needs to be telegraphed to his audience with sledgehammer force, making the film at times too maudlin to bear.Grade: B",Pleasantville
19,morrison-dylan-fan,All thing old=bad.All things new=good.,7,30 July 2005,"We all know that everyone in the past was a racist/homophobe/xenophobe,etc.,while everyone alive today is enlightened,but I get a bit worried when movies such as this indulge in back-slapping for the liberal elite. It might be worth reading,say ""Destructive Generation: Second Thoughts About the '60s"" by Peter Collier & David Horowitz.The authors suggest that the ""anything goes-express yourself"" hedonism of the post-Pleasantville generation is expressed in broken marriages/higher murder rates,the spread of Aids,abortion,and sexual disease,while it's difficult now to find a family with a father in it. Are we really right to be smug about the past? I accept that we're ALL much better educated now (ho ho,or at least so the pass-rates suggest),but is it possible that OUR values might be time-specific,too,rather than TRUTHS revealed by Karl Marx and the 'scientist' Kinsey.Can it be that we're smug liberals,who might be replaced by conservatives or Muslims? Have they ever made a movie where people from the 50s hop into our time and show us up as hypocrites and fools in sexual/relationship matters?",Pleasantville
20,anaconda-40658,"Simply, Pleasant.",8,6 November 2015,"Pleasantville (1998): Dir: Gary Ross / Cast: Tobey Maguire, Reese Witherspoon, William H. Macy, Joan Allen, Jeff Daniels: Wonderful film about change in people, lifestyles and culture. It regards a TV show set in April 1958 where all seems perfect in the black and white world inhabited by the characters. Plot regards siblings zapped into their T.V. with a magic remote control given by a mysterious repairman. This is questionable since the power of the remote control seems contrived and never explained. Nonetheless they are in Pleasantville and Tobey Maguire plays along so not to upset the balance between reality and fantasy. Reese Witherspoon opts to educate the high school boys on sex. Things get complicated once colour enters the frame. Some people prefer tradition while others embrace change. Tremendous achievement by Gary Ross who exploits sitcom stereotypes but the true gem is the exquisite art direction that reveals the time and frame these characters live in day by day. Maguire and Witherspoon well cast in the leads with different attitudes towards the sudden ordeal and they are backed by a terrific supporting cast. William H. Macy and Joan Allen play off familiar sitcom parents. Jeff Daniels plays a guy who works at a malt shop and is having an affair with Joan. The film expresses our sense of change in values and lifestyles and our sense of self. Score: 8 / 10",Pleasantville
21,The_Void,Imaginative surreal fantasy drama,8,3 April 2006,"There have been films that follow the idea of real life merging with a television show before; Woody Allen's The Purple Rose of Cairo being the first that springs to mind. There have also been films that see outsiders coming into a society; and Edward Scissorhands stands out here, both for the reason mentioned and for it's surreal atmosphere - but there's nothing else QUITE like this film, and aside from presenting some very nice visuals; there's also a good message here, and Gary Ross' film works on a number of levels. The main theme on display is the way that society has undergone massive changes. We follow a typical pair of teenage siblings in the 'real' world, who find themselves in the idyllic TV show 'Pleasantville' after a run in with a strange TV repair man. The morals in their new world are a bit different to their own, and it's not long before the pleasant little town, that is filled with pleasant little people, is starting to discover a whole range of new ideas from their new inhabitants; and most strikingly, they're bringing colour into the black and white world.While I enjoyed this film very much, it's not without its problems. There's so much that can be done with a plot like this, and even with a running time of two hours; not everything can be fit into it. Things such as the relationship between the kids and their parents are hardly realised at all, and the film spends more time on changing ideals, than allowing us to see the difference between then and now. The entire plot is also very pretentious, and really quite closed minded; but it's delivered with genuine emotional and, while watching, it's hard not to be entranced by it. The film benefits from the pairing of Tobey Maguire and Reese Witherspoon. Neither of these has ever particularly impressed me, but they're very good here. Despite being young, both actors have a sort of old-school look about them, which blends well with this setting. The idea of having black and white and colour, in a film together was met with a lot of praise upon the release of the recent 'Sin City', but this film did it seven years earlier, and the colour scheme allows the director to come up with some very picturesque scenes. On the whole, this is perhaps not as great as it could have been; but Pleasantville is still an excellent surreal drama, and I wouldn't hesitate to recommend it.",Pleasantville
22,JamesHitchcock,"Thought-Provoking Film, Handicapped by the Weight of its Symbolism",7,3 November 2004,"Contains SpoilersColour, and the absence of colour, provides the English language with a number of metaphors. To say that a person is 'colourless' or that a thing is 'grey' or 'monochrome' is to imply that that person or thing is boring. The adjective 'colourful', by contrast, when used figuratively, implies that something is interesting. To see something in 'black and white' terms is to make a simplistic judgment about it. 'Coloured' is an adjective sometimes used of black people or others of non-European descent. (Or at least it was so used; in Britain it has largely fallen into disuse). 'Pleasantville' is a film that plays upon these various linguistic usages. 'Pleasantville' is the name of a 1950s television comedy set in a fictitious town of the same name. The town is supposed to be the epitome of the idyllic American small town- an easygoing place where everyone is polite and pleasant to one another and where misfortune and unhappiness are unknown. At the centre of the film are two 1990s teenagers. David and Jennifer are brother and sister with contrasting characters. David is a geeky loner who takes refuge from his worries about the state of the world in the escapist entertainment provided by re-runs of the 'Pleasantville' series on television. Jennifer is the sort of dumb blonde who is less likely to worry about the state of the world than the state of her makeup; her preoccupations are her boyfriends, her popularity with the other girls at her school, and cultivating the art of bitchy sarcasm, with her brother as her main target. The central concept of the film is that David and Jennifer find themselves trapped in the fictional world of Pleasantville, courtesy of a magical TV remote control device supplied by an eccentric elderly TV repairman with strange powers. This world is a very strange one, where anything not mentioned in the TV series does not exist. The series was broadcast in black-and-white, so that is how the world appears. The series is entirely shot in the town itself, so the people know nothing of the outside world; indeed, they do not even believe that there is an outside world. Certain topics were taboo in 1950s television, so the citizens of Pleasantville are ignorant of sex, and there are no lavatories. Nobody is ever seen reading, so the books in the town library all have blank pages. The weather is always sunny, and rainfall is unknown. As nothing bad can ever happen, nothing ever catches fire, so the fire brigade's sole task is to rescue cats from trees. (Something similar occurs in the British children's TV series 'Trumpton', which also features a fire brigade which does everything but put out fires).The arrival of David and Jennifer, however, provokes a number of changes in the town. David tries, at first, to fit into his role, but Jennifer rebels against the town's conformist ethos and seduces her boyfriend, providing Pleasantville with its first recorded sexual encounter. Printed books start to appear in the library. The high school basketball team loses a match for the first time in its history. (One thing that is never explained is where the opposing teams come from if there is no world outside Pleasantville). Rain starts to fall, and a tree bursts into flames. People begin to rebel against conformity and act in hitherto unprecedented ways. Most significant of all, colour begins to appear in this formerly monochrome world. At first only small objects, such as a red rose or pink bubble gum, appear in colour, but soon this spreads to larger things such as a car, and even to people. These changes, however, lead to discontent as the more conservative citizens see them as a threat to the town's values and fight back against the 'coloureds'. Before long, a riot breaks out. The film reminded me of another film from1998, Peter Weir's 'The Truman Show', which had at its heart an inverted version of the same idea. In 'Pleasantville' characters from the real world find themselves transported to a fictional one; in 'The Truman Show' the central character finds out that the world in which he had been living, and which he believed to be real, is actually a fictional one created for the entertainment of others. Of the two films, however, I preferred 'The Truman Show'; although 'Pleasantville' has its good points, it tends to be handicapped by the weight of its own symbolism. The colour/black and white distinction is given two separate symbolic meanings. The main symbolism is 'monochrome = conformist; colour = free-thinking'. Those characters who break away from established habits of thought and action are, generally speaking, the first to appear in colour, while more conservative ones remain in black and white. (I am here using the word 'conservative' in the sense of 'conformist' rather than 'politically right wing'). This theme- the need to be oneself rather than being bound by convention or acting in a conformist way- is well handled, but the treatment of the film's racial and political themes is less assured. The scenes of the riot, in which a group of 'monochrome' youths attack the 'coloureds', seemed to me to be particularly heavy-handed. The breaking of windows, and even more the burning of the books that have recently started to appear in the library, were obvious references to the excesses of the Nazis. Nazi imagery is something that should be used with caution, and its use here gives the impression that Gary Ross is equating the conservatism of small-town America with Nazi ideology. If this impression is deliberate, it is offensive hyperbole; if it is inadvertent, it is an example of clumsy film-making. Although the population of Pleasantville is shown in monochrome it is, in racial terms, exclusively white, but there is nonetheless an attempt to make the film a parable about racism. With an obvious pun on the two meanings of the word 'coloured', monochrome is used to signify 'Caucasian' and colour 'non-Caucasian'. To strengthen this interpretation, there are signs reading 'no coloreds', and references to a monochrome character having a 'colored girlfriend'. Unfortunately, this usage conflicts with the film's other symbolic use of colour. By the end of the film, all the citizens of Pleasantville have changed from black and white to colour, and there are references to 'colouredness' being something that is within us all. Colour is on the one hand used as an emblem of our shared humanity, and on the other as a symbol of racial division, a contradiction that was never really resolved. There were also attempts at religious symbolism (a scene where a character eats a red apple is an obvious reference to the Garden of Eden story), but these are never really developed. Despite my criticisms, my overall impression of the film was a favourable one. It has a visual inventiveness reminiscent of the work of Tim Burton, especially in the scenes which mixed colour and monochrome effects. A scene where pink blossoms fall from grey trees was particularly striking. (The coloured scenes in Pleasantville, although not those showing David and Jennifer in the real world, are shot in not-quite-accurate colour, reminiscent of certain fifties films, which gives them an otherworldly charm).There were a number of good performances, notably from Jeff Daniels as Mr Johnson, the timid soda-store owner who becomes a daring artistic radical, from Joan Allen as the repressed mother and from JT Walsh as the town's authoritarian mayor. An interesting and thought-provoking film. 7/10",Pleasantville
23,namashi_1,A Beautiful Film!,9,15 July 2016,"'Pleasantville' is A Beautiful Film, that ranks amongst the best films from 1998. This wonderful, heartwarming film is a tale of love & liberation. And the performances, are uniformly excellent!'Pleasantville' Synopsis: Two 1990s teenagers find themselves in a 1950s sitcom where their influence begins to profoundly change that complacent world. 'Pleasantville' deals with social issues such as racism and freedom of speech. Over-here, our two teenager protagonist's, enter a world where they are conditioned & comfortable with a monotonous, regressive lifestyle. Its only when our protagonist's enter their world & offer them the pleasure to feel, react, love & disapprove. 'Pleasantville' is treated with a lighthearted tone, although its message, is heavy & also powerful.Gary Ross's Screenplay is wonderful. The Writing is ingenious, offering a tale on such themes, without every surrendering to melodrama. Ross's Direction, on the other-hand, is perfect. He's handled the film very well. Cinematography is superb. Editing is crisp. Art & Costume Design are flawless. Randy Newman's Score is in perfect sync with the film's mood. Background Score deserves a special mention.Performance-Wise: 'Pleasantville' is embellished with strong performances. Tobey Maguire is fantastic, yet again! His transformation from a fan-boy to a man who must let people live for who they are, deserves distinction marks. Reese Witherspoon shines as Tobey's rebellious sister. Jeff Daniels is remarkable, as always. But its Joan Allen & William H. Macy, who steal the show. As a couple used to feeling only to a limit, both of the supremely talented actors pitch in knockout performances! The Late/Great J. T. Walsh & The Late/Great Paul Walker lend great support. On the whole, 'Pleasantville' is a wonder of a film.",Pleasantville

25,MovieAddict2016,Clever social satire,7,2 May 2005,"Pleasantville, the town, is a metaphor. ""Pleasantville,"" the movie, is an analysis.Tobey Maguire and Reese Witherspoon star as two American teenagers who magically enter the black-and-white world of Pleasantville through their television set, where they are trapped in a 1950s era of living.The social satire is excellent. The parallels drawn between the squeaky-clean '50s and the grungy late '90s are actually rather realistic so far as outer layers go. In the film, Maguire's character takes it upon himself to live in harmony but his sister decides to pollute the minds of the town inhabitants by having sex with every boy in sight.Soon the pale world of ""Pleasantville"" is springing to life with vibrant colors. The more sin enters the town, the more it blooms into our present-day environment.""Pleasantville"" is a really clever satire of society and also a clear allegory for racism.

26,lasttimeisaw,Still Pleasant for a second viewing!,7,28 April 2014,"A re-watch of PLEASANTVILLE from writer-director Gary Ross (THE HUNGER GAMES 2012, 7/10) is as pleasant as it the title suggests, a really novel cautionary tale coated with a profound satire milieu. It is a golden idea to juxtapose monochrome with colourful graduation concurring with the evolving storyline. A present-day (1990s) high school siblings David (Maguire) and Jennifer (Witherspoon) have been transported inside their TV, as Bud and Mary Sue, the children of George and Betty Parker (H. Macy and Allen), living in a small black & white town called Pleasantville, based on a sitcom of 1950s where all its residents are also exclusively black and white and comport themselves in a monotonous harmony with storybook unconsciousness of their own feelings, books are blank, toilets are empty spaces, basket-shooting accuracy is 100%, fire and rain are non-existent, parents never hear about sex, the lovey-dovey Lovers' Lane is the place where young couples go for holding hands. In order to get back their life on track until the odd TV repairman (Knotts) is willing to transport them back to reality, David, who is a big fan of the show, proposes they should abide by their characters and act along with rest of the people, but Jennifer is a unchaste nonconformist, on their first night, she has her way with the basketball jock Skip (Walker), like the snake in the Eden, she usher sex in the town, and ignites the ripple effects with colour-transformations (from black & white to multicolour) of the unsophisticated denizens whoever experiences any degree of self-discovery and the objects as well. Betty rejects to be an archetype housewife and finds uninhibited romance with Bud's friend Bill (Daniels), whose untapped talent as a painter also be spontaneously triggered thereafter by her. Meanwhile, David (Bud) and Jennifer (Mary Sue) are also undergoing their own metamorphosis through the revolutionary shift, their own life- changing epiphanies will arrive too although from the mid-stream Jennifer is largely sidelined in the plot while David becomes a pioneering hero to defend his cause to unleash everyone's own feelings from the conservative party leads by mayor Big Bob (Walsh). A great cast of veterans, Joan Allen is the MVP as she stuns the audiences with her elegant flair to bring true vitality to her role, she is the most intrepid person in the film, the ending with an equivocal ménage-à-trois scenario is a big thumb-up to the liberation of feminism. William H. Macy has less showy pieces to perform, but he effuses a drolly naivety all the way through, his final conversion is cliché in the script but he nails it with compelling sympathy. It is also a career-defining role for Reese Witherspoon, her Jennifer is the kind of rebellious kids with an open mind about sex and a hipster's selfishness, as in Alexander Payne's ELECTION (1999, 7/10) one year later. Tobey Maguire has been consistent outstanding in his earlier filmography, not as wide-eyed as he looks, in the films he is always arresting without giving away too much information about his true feelings, it is the real deal to be a star on the big-screen, as SPIDER- MAN trilogy (2002-2007) would prove, which earns him a deluge of money but also ruins his following career, or maybe acting is not the priority in his life now, how pitiful it is. What is not so agreeable in the film? In some way, the script is too idiosyncratic to make the ends meet, one has to be a complete non-skeptic to buy all its castle-in-the-air premise, nevertheless it is a film has its distinct merits, to say the least is Randy Newman's hearty music score and Gary Ross' competence to single-handedly pin down its dystopia nucleus with sterling nostalgia lustre.",Pleasantville

28,KineticSeoul,Original fairy tale that kids and especially adults can enjoy,8,13 April 2010,"I really liked this movie, not only is it pleasant it's original. The plot is about a brother and a sister, David and Jennifer going into the TV show literally, into one of those old sit-com where everything is black and white and everyone has a perfect family. And the people are living the same routine life while everything is black and white, but David and Jennifer starts changing that. The movie has a deep meaning about it, even on today's society and I enjoyed it from beginning to end. It was like watching a fairy tale for adults, I honestly don't know how anyone can dislike this film. Sure the second half isn't as good as the first half, but this is still really worth checking out.8.3/10",Pleasantville
29,sddavis63,Wonderful and Funny Satire,8,6 December 2000,"I enjoyed this movie immensely, but had to watch it twice before I think I picked out the most important part of the message.The plot is relatively simple: by the use of an ingenious TV remote control device, two teenagers are magically transported into a 1950's TV sitcom called ""Pleasantville"" and assume the identity of the main brother-sister characters. Of course, being a 1950's sitcom, everything in this imaginary world is black and white, everything is perfect, husbands and wives sleep in twin beds, etc. The introduction of two kids from the '90's is sure to ""add some colour"" to this black and white world.When I first watched ""Pleasantville"" I treated it as a rather pleasant and funny example of culture shock, as the kids from the '90's came to terms with Pleasantville and Pleasantville came to terms with them. However, with the second viewing I was far more taken with the political satire involved in it.There is a rather abrupt shift in focus about halfway through the movie. Up to that point, it had been rather amusing. From that point on, as those opposed to change in Pleasantville's black and white world begin to resist, the tone actually becomes quite ominous; sort of McCarthy, Communism and Orwell's 1984 all rolled into one, complete with mob violence and book burning. All those who treat their politics in simple black and white terms should sit up and take note of the dangers involved.An interesting subplot is that any type of lifestyle can become monotonous. While the kids of Pleasantville break out of their monotony by engaging in the more physical pleasures of life that had been denied to them, it is Jennifer - the ""loose"" girl from the '90's - who discovers that her very ""looseness"" has become monotony. It's only when she discovers the joy involved in reading and study that she breaks out and discovers new life.This was an absolutely fascinating and immensely enjoyable movie.",Pleasantville
30,paul2001sw-1,"Pleasant, but pernicious",5,26 September 2004,"In 'The Wizard of Oz', Dorothy dreamt of an exciting life outside her native Kansas and was whisked into a colourful (and then revolutionary) fantasy world. In 'Pleasantville', this scenario is reversed: David (Tobey Maguire) dreams of (and then visits) the idealised world portrayed in a 1950s, black-and-white soap opera, in contrast to the ""exciting"" real world in which he is just a geek. His trendy sister, played by Reese Witherspoon, travels with him (though only under severe protest). The need of the characters to adapt to, and not to upset, the ""past"" has elements of 'Back to the Future' about it; while the contrast between the real world and a santised utopia, whose inhabitants know nothing different, resembles 'The Truman Show'. 'Pleasantville' is less obviously comic than either of these films, but it is beautifully executed and William H. Macy in particular seems perfect for his role as David's fictional father. Dramatically, however, it suffers from the fact that Maguire never manages to convince that he truly believes in the reality of his situation. And when films such as 'The Last Picture Show' and 'What's Eating Gilbert Grape?' have addressed (with great subtlety) what is lost, and gained, when the values on which small town communities are based break down, it seems strange that 'Pleasantville' offers us only a pointless dichotomy between a world where everything is nice but dull, and another equally unreal world, where the pursuit of individual gratification always results in its acquisition. As a result, the film does little more than lazily peddle the standard Hollywood myth, that we can be anything we want if we believe it; a sad end for a work of some artistic distinction.Dorothy tired of Oz and came to wish for Kansas; likewise, David returns to the real world, and in spite of knocking down a conservative straw man, 'Pleasantville' is truly a conservative (and smug) film in itself. David's manifesto is supposedly that there is no right way in life; but as David himself becomes cooler, while his sister learns the joy of books, the standard happy medium is thrust upon the audience with no apparent awareness of the blatant contradiction. In fact, the film's vision of modern life appears no less rose-tinted than the vision of the 1950s it rejects. A pleasant, but pernicious, film.",Pleasantville
31,bowmanblue,More films should be like this,9,23 December 2017,"There are some films which seem to come and go and no one ever really seems to notice. With all the big-budget movies out there which are predicable, laden with annoying CGI effects and follow a formula where you know exactly what will happen at all times, 'Pleasantville' is a real breath of fresh air. Yet, for some reason, no one really talks about it even though it's held in high regard seemingly with everyone who's seen it.It's rare that a film's tagline sums it up so well, but you may see on any marketing 'The Truman Show meets Back to the Future.' And it's hard to put it any better (although I saw a hint of 'The Last Action Hero' in the plot, but it's barely noticeable!). Two of today's American teens are - for reasons you'll soon find out - 'beamed' into an old black and white TV show from yesteryear. It's safe to say that things worked differently in the days before cell phones and Instagram. Back then firemen constantly rescued stranded cats from trees, teens holding hands was still a taboo and the most exciting thing the youth of the time could do was hand out the local milkshake bar. Therefore, our two young protagonists (played by Tobey Maguire and Reece Witherspoon) find it a challenge to blend in with the locals.However, things really start to go wrong when their influence - literally - bring new life to the fictional telly town. Their modern influence slowly starts seeping into the people and environment and the black and white world they've found themselves in starts to become colour. Now, that wouldn't be so bad, but the locals start engaging in - what they consider - to be 'immoral' behaviour (which you'd probably find on kids' TV in today's times). What follows is a tale about whether our two teens can actually escape their TV-prison and, what will happen to the residents they leave behind.It's truly one of the most clever - vaguely mainstream - films to come out of Hollywood in recent times and, if you're in the mood for something that doesn't involve superheroes flying around a destroyed U.S. city, then you should definitely watch this one.",Pleasantville

All the characters are wonderful, and the story is one of the coolest I have ever seen, plus Tobey Maguire, Reese Witherspoon, and Joan Allen are all simply amazing in this!. In my opinion this should be in the top 250, and you never know what's gonna happen next, as it's always unpredictable, plus it's extremely well made and cleverly written as well. It's quite hilarious at times, and Reese does an absolute perfect job of doing a sudden change in character from bad girl/good girl, as she was amazing as both! plus her and Tobey Maguire had fantastic chemistry together!. All the characters are extremely likable, and Jeff Dainels had some fascinating scenes, plus I loved all the references to the racism in the 50's (sign in the window saying No Colored's), and the Nazism(Reichstag fire where they burned all the books). Paul Walker has a small part here, as he does a decent job, and Tobey Maguire amazed me here, with his boyish charm, and his extreme likability, plus I loved it when Bud (Tobey Maguire) helped out Betty Parker (Joan Allen), with the bullies by punching one of them out.I really loved the music, and another one of my favorite scenes is when Joan Allen asks Reese what sex is, plus William H Macy is wonderful as the father. The ending was just perfect, and even at over 120 minutes it was never overlong, as I actually wanted more! plus it was just so engrossing. Another one of my favorite moments is when Mary Sue (Reese) kicks Skip (Paul Walker) in the balls so he Doesen't burn her book, and Don Knotts has an amusing role as a quirky TV repair man, plus Gary Ross does an incredible job of directing. I had extremely high expectations for this and I must say it actually exceeded them big time, and it;s also wonderfully thought provoking as well, plus I also loved the attire&costumes everybody wore!.I will be watching this movie often, and this will have you smiling throughout, plus Dainels and Joan Allen had some really good scenes together. It will really make you think after you are done watching it, and I can't decide whether I liked the black and white scenes or the color scenes best because they were both incredible! plus I'm sure everyone had a blast working on this. Marley Shelton is absolutely charming and beautiful as Margaret, as she had great chemistry with Toby, plus I loved the dialog as well. It's also one of the most creative movies I have ever seen, as it's astonishingly clever, plus J.T. Walsh is excellent as the stubborn asshole. This is spectacular fantasy fun, that's now one of my absolute favorite movies, with brilliant effects, and outstanding performances and if you haven't seen it, please do so right this instant, you won't regret it trust me!.The Direction is simply incredible!. Gary Ross does an incredible! job here, with amazing camera work,wonderful angles, beautiful scenery, and just keeping the film at an extremely engrossing pace, he did a perfect job!.The Acting is outstanding!. Tobey Maguire is amazing here, he is incredibly likable,had a great geeky, boyish charm, had fantastic chemistry with Reese Witherspoon and Marely Shelton,and I can't understand why anyone would dislike his performance, as you can't help but love him!, he was amazing (Tobey Rules!!!). Reese Witherspoon is also amazing as always, she is stunningly gorgeous, does an absolute perfect job of switching from good too bad, had fantastic chemistry with Tobey, was often hilarious, extremely likable (even as a bitch), and like Tobey, was one of the main reasons why this movie was so successful! (Reese Rules!!!!!!!!!!). Joan Allen is also amazing here, she is extremely likable, beautiful, absolutely charming, gives one of the best performances in her career, and had some wonderful scenes with Jeff Dainels I loved her! (Joan Rules!!!). William H. Macy is wonderful as the father, he was very likable, and was often a riot, he is such a terrific actor, that deserves more credit!. Jeff Daniels is fantastic as the soda shop owner, he had a great goofy character, was extremely likable,and was just too cool overall!. Marley Shelton is gorgeous, and does fantastic with what she had to do, she had great chemistry with Tobey, played a girlfriend everybody would love to have, as I absolutely adored her character, she was just awesome!. J.T. Walsh is excellent as the stubborn asshole, you will really dislike him. Don Knotts has a great quirky role as a TV repair man, and seemed to be having fun. Paul Walker is actually pretty decent as the school Jock, and did his job well. Rest of the cast do fine.Overall if you haven't seen it please do so right this instant you won't regret it trust me, it's one of the best movies ever!. ***** out of 5",Pleasantville
33,capone666,The Vidiot Reviews....,6,6 February 2018,"PleasantvilleThe worst part about being a 1950s housewife was making your bed. Then making your husbands.Mind you, the post-war married couple in this dramedy would enjoy having separate bunks.During a TV marathon of the black-and-white sitcom Pleasantville, high school loser David (Tobey Maguire) and his much cooler twin sister Jennifer (Reese Witherspoon) are magically transported from the free-spirited 1990s to the uptight 1950s.As the siblings navigate their black-and-white surroundings their liberated attitude affects everyone in town, including their sexually repressed parents (Joan Allen, William H. Macy). But as coitus turns townsfolk Technicolor, it begets segregation.A humorous yet powerful allegory on race relations and sexual orientation, this underrated box-office flop from 1998 manages to deliver an array of impactful social messages without getting lost in the science or absurdity of its high concept premise. Incidentally, living inside of a 1950s TV set would give you radiation poisoning. Yellow Lightvidiotreviews.blogspot.ca",Pleasantville
34,vincentlynch-moonoi,Exceptional film...different,8,17 November 2015,"Let's see. How do I explain this? Hmmmm. This film is not one of the truly great films (like ""Gone With The Wind"" or ""Doctor Zhivago"" or ""Lawrence Of Arabia""). But, nevertheless, it is -- quite simply -- a brilliant film.Oddly enough, I avoided watching this film for the last 17 years. And even after I started watching it this time, during the first 20 minutes I repeatedly had the urge to turn it off. It just seemed uninteresting. Then, when the two teens are magically transported to Pleasantville, a rather complex and intriguing story begins to unfold. I can't help but think that the story is loosely based on sort of the mirror image of ""Father Knows Best"", which was one of the most enchanting of all the early family story television shows from the 1950s. ""Father Knows Best"" was, of course, often the 1950s-idealized life, which wasn't very much like real life in the 1950s (although, I see ""Father Knows Best"" more as a drama and one in which each of the characters had their challenges, though those challenges were muted to fit into television mores of the era.One of the most intriguing things about this film is that the viewer doesn't really have much of any idea where the story is leading...to what conclusion it is racing toward.The acting here is top notch, even though no one in the cast is one of my favorite actors by any means. Tobey Maguire, never a favorite of mine (although I always saw him as a competent actor) is perfect here. I have enjoyed Jeff Daniels pretty much only in ""The Newsroom"" before this, but he brings a real sensitivity to his role here' I'm quite impressed. William H. Macy, another non-favorite of mine, is perfect as the ""Honey I'm home"" father. And the very talented (though I usually can't remember her name) Joan Allen as the mother is brilliant, as well.A word should be said about the wonderful special effects here -- dabs of color in a black and white world. Just about the most magical use of the concept since Dorothy landed in Oz.At first I thought that the director left out Black people, yet there is an interesting reference to them (""coloreds""). I wonder how the story would have changed if they had actually included African-Americans. The story doesn't end with a bang...the bang is earlier on.Excellent film, and while not one of the ""great"" film masterpieces...definitely brilliant.",Pleasantville
35,atlasmb,A Beautiful Creation,10,28 March 2020,"It is human nature to feel comfort in the familiar. The unexpected may be feared, but the status quo is ""pleasant"".A supernatural experience changes everything about the lives of two siblings, David (Tobey Maguire) and Jennifer (Reese Witherspoon). What results is an allegory about the status quo, containing so many cinematic tropes and literary metaphors that viewers can read many sub-stories into the narrative, making this a more universally relatable film.The cast is strong, featuring Joan Allen as Betty, the traditional housewife of 50s television. Her journey from what-is to what-could-be makes a strong statement about conventionality and the desire for personal growth.The film's focus on the status quo versus the revolutionary makes it a statement about all who challenge conventions, from Galileo to Little Richard, from The Impressionists to The Beatles, from Mark Twain to Einstein.This is a magical film that excites the imagination and reminds us that little pleasures abound, if we just open our senses and our minds.",Pleasantville
36,kenjha,Leave It To Toby,7,4 July 2010,"A magical TV remote transports a brother and sister from the 1990s to a sitcom town in the 1950s, corrupting the innocent residents of the town. The premise is interesting, leading to some amusing moments initially, but eventually the execution leaves something to be desired. The story meanders around rather aimlessly before turning heavy-handed with social commentary and moralizing. The film is rather obvious in making its simplistic points, using black and white cinematography to represent repression and socialism while using color as a metaphor for tolerance and liberalism. It has a good cast, especially Maguire, Allen, and Daniels, but it runs out of steam.",Pleasantville
37,The-Sarkologist,Turning your black and white life into a world of colour,7,19 October 2013,"I read a review of this movie and they trashed it because they said that it cheapened sex. As such, I decided not to watch it. At first I thought that it was in the same vein as the Truman Show, but it is far from it. Where the Truman Show had some deep, intricate themes regarding control, Pleasantville is about enjoying life and questions the ideas of morality.The movie is about a fifties television show where everything is perfect. A boy loves the show while his sister scorns it. They are completely opposite in personality, she being a slut while he being a nerd. They then get drawn into the show, and the boy is ecstatic while she is angered, especially since she misses out on a date with Mr Studley from her school (who would want to date a donkey Mr Studley anyway - they sound so try-hard).By the end of the movie, the boy has shed his shell and comes to see that a perfect world is not always a happy world while she discovers that there is much more to the world than sex. The movie depicts these changes in characters by giving them colours (as the TV Show is black and white). As people come to find joy in life, they come to take on colours. The movie emphasises that this joy is not simply sexual gratification, as the sister has a lot of sex, yet does not become coloured until she discovers the wonder of literature.One wonders if this movie is trying to advocate the 90's over the fifties, but I don't think so. What I think this movie is trying to draw out is that which we find joyful. We might be happy doing something, but it might not be truly joyful, especially since we won't want to do it because of fear of persecution. This is emphasised at the end as those who are still black and white begin to persecute those who are coloured.When I saw this movie, I wasn't paying that much attention, but what I did see was that it was a much better movie that I expected, and will have to watch it again more closely.",Pleasantville
38,zkonedog,A Fun Movie That Also Makes You Think,10,6 March 2017,"Just four months after the incredibly nuanced ""The Truman Show"", ""Pleasantville"" hit theaters featuring many similar themes. Remarkably, it is just as good as the Jim Carrey feature.For a basic plot summary, ""Pleasantville"" begins with a sibling argument. David (Tobey Maguire) wants to watch the Pleasantville (a corny 1950s-ish TV show) marathon, while Jennifer (Reese Witherspoon) is expecting a hot date with her boyfriend. In the fight over the remote, both teens are inexplicably sucked into the TV set and thus into the black-and-white world of Pleasantville, where everything is perfect...or is it?The hallmark of this film is that it deals with some pretty heavy social issues without getting preachy or self-indulgent. Is the Pleasantville utopia something to strive for? Or is it something to fear and must have some ""color"" added to it? This is not a movie of black-and-whites, but many shades of grey.It is also just a fun movie as well. Don Knotts plays an incredibly goofy character, and the humor of David and Jennifer trying to adapt to their new territory is often hilarious. Basically, ""Pleasantville"" strikes the perfect balance of fun and drama.One can't review this movie without also regaling the performances of William H. Macy, Jeff Daniels, and Joan Allen in very key roles. They are perfectly cast and given a plethora of material to work with, making every scene an important one (nothing is wasted or prolonged).Thus, while perhaps not containing quite as much gravitas as ""The Truman Show"", ""Pleasantville"" is just as good of a movie in its own right via its combination of deep themes, humor, acting, and fun.",Pleasantville

40,strong-122-478885,"Is Carnal Knowledge, Like Ignorance, Really Bliss?",3,18 July 2013,"You know, I much preferred the b&w, 1950s town of Pleasantville before the characters of Jennifer and David arrived in it and literally corrupted it with the colors of carnal knowledge. (Yep. That's right! - Corrupted it!) It was especially the Jennifer ""air-head"" character who literally slutified Pleasantville in no time flat. She even educated her TV-Mother on how to please oneself through the dexterity of finger masturbation.I thought that as a movie Pleasantville got its equation for fulfillment all wrong. By using the screwy metaphor of color as its yardstick to measure fulfillment, I was told, plain and simple, that a black and white world equaled sterility, close-mindedness and gross naivety. While, on the other hand, a Technicolor world meant only beauty, life-lovingness, and rich rewards.This film seemed to have absolutely no understanding or appreciation for the targeted era in US culture that it so smugly attempted to belittle and ridicule.Pleasantville's message was neither deep nor meaningful. All that this picture seemed to be was just another way for its producers to show off their expertise solely in terms of its CG imagery.Pleasantville's story repeatedly told me that one must drop (like - Pronto!) all sexual inhibitions in order to be totally fulfilled in this life. And, yet, it made no mention that it's due to a lack of common sense and rampant, unprotected sex that this world is rife with STDs and unwanted pregnancies.I found it really hard to believe that the characters living in Pleasantville (before the colors of sex arrived) were so bloody clueless that they didn't know that a whole, wide world existed out there beyond the idealistic borders of their quaint, little town.Like, didn't these innocent-ones ever watch movies and TV? And, didn't they actually see in color? And, finally - It really baffled me that the TV Repairman (whose motives were decidedly dubious) had become absolutely outraged when he found out what dear-Jennifer and her darling bro, David, had done to the innocence of Pleasantville - Especially since it was he who had zapped them there in the first place.Like, what the hell did he expect to happen by introducing these 2 casualties of the post-sexual revolution into this unspoiled environment?",Pleasantville
41,Lechuguilla,Brave New World Meets The Twilight Zone,7,10 July 2003,"I like this film.  It's different.  It invites the viewer to think about, and ponder, concepts like morality and values, stereotypes, fear, and social change.  Each person will come away with his or her own interpretation of the film's ""meaning"".  And this ""meaning"" will be consistent, no doubt, with the viewer's own life experiences, values, and belief system.I consider ""Pleasantville"" to be a quasi-sci-fi film, one that I think Aldous Huxley and Rod Serling would both approve of.The film does seem to get bogged down in the middle.  It overplays the sex angle.  And I could wish for more 1950's rock and roll music.  But the acting is fine, especially the performance of Joan Allen.  And the lighting is very well done.Overall, I was pleasantly surprised that a film made in the last ten years could be as original, as cerebral, and as under-stated as ""Pleasantville"".",Pleasantville
42,smatysia,Clever and original,7,5 March 2013,"I have to give Pleasantville credit for cleverness, if not outright originality. It is not like anything I have seen recently. I was vaguely aware of the basic premise when the movie came out, probably from reading a review. It was done very well, the symbolism being out there for everyone, but not beating us over the head with it. When the NO COLOREDS sign appeared in a shop window, I was afraid it was going to get ultra-preachy about race, but they just made the point and moved on. Reese Witherspoon was so beautiful here. Apparently she was about twenty-one when it was filmed, but I could see that certain something, the charisma of a movie star. Joan Allen was also very, very good in a somewhat sad part. I resisted watching this film, but wish I hadn't. It's pretty good!",Pleasantville
43,Catherine_Grace_Zeh,Excellent comedy that's reminiscent of old sitcoms from the 1950's,9,21 November 2005,"In my opinion, PLEASANTVILLE is an excellent comedy that's reminiscent of old sitcoms from the 1950's. The first time I ever saw this movie was when I was on my way to Boston for a competition in May 2000. When David (Tobey Maguire) and Jennifer (Reese Witherspoon) got sucked into the TV, I thought to myself, ""What is this? A spin-off of STAY TUNED?"" I said that because I was reminded so much of that movie. It is, incidentally, a version of STAY TUNED. If you ask me, this movie had terrific performances, predominantly in the 1950's. Now in conclusion, if you like Tobey Maguire or Reese Witherspoon movies, this is definitely one to see. When you see it, prepare for a smashing good time and laugh. I also guarantee you you'll want to see this movie over and over again.",Pleasantville
44,NateWatchesCoolMovies,"Brilliant social commentary, touching characters, a true classic",10,13 September 2015,"Gary Ross's Pleasantville is one of the most heartfelt, creative, thought provoking dramedies I've seen in a while. I was floored by its benign, lighthearted first third, which gives way to some unexpectedly deep social commentary, brought to life bu truly remarkable performances, and stunning, storybook cinematography that looks like Sin City had a baby with Rumble Fish. Tobey Maguire, an actor I usually can't stand, is nicely low key, while his sister Reese Witherspoon gets the peppy, in your face persona. Following a terse bit of sibling rivalry, a strange TV repairman shows up, bestowing on them an ancient looking replacement remote. Before they can ask where he even came from, they are magically whisked from their 1990's living room right into TV land, specifically a cheery black and white 1950's sitcom called Pleasentville. They find themselves in a gosh golly, apple pie, white picket fence realm of perky, smiling housewives, rampant celibacy (the characters in this town are essentially shells of humans, and have no idea what sex is...yet;). The naive, mentally stunted townsfolk function at the truncated level that the show's writing is allowed, resulting in strangely robotic, stepford wives like versions of people. That all changes however, when Witherspoon introduces a highschool hunk (Paul Walker, hilarious) to the ol' hanky panky. From there on in the townspeople gradually discover books, music, art, and as such start to see the world in vibrant colors, and become colored themselves. It's a genius idea for a film that's executed perfectly, with some scenarios that really pay off, making you feel and think. J.T. Walsh, always fantastic, plays the town's fearful skeptic of a mayor. William H. Macy nails the father role perfectly (Where's my dinner?!), Joan Allen gives the best work I've ever seen her do, giving force and gentle feeling to the wife who starts exploring herself, and the world around her. The crown jewel acting wise though is Jeff Daniels, as an aloof diner owner who discovers an affinity for the arts. He brings such a warmth and budding humanity to the role. There's subtext relating to Mccarthy-ism, and not letting the powers that be tell how you what to like, how to feel or what to do. There's a lot to enjoy in this package, and indeed all aspects are done so well its a wonder this one hasn't retained acclaim over the years.",Pleasantville
45,TOMNEL,"There is some truly horrible comedy here, but there are also some very beautiful moments.",7,24 November 2011,"Here is a strange film. Not strange in it's intriguing plot, but strange in the way the film is set up. It starts off visually ugly and comically overstuffed with predictable and clichéd fish out of water humor, but by the 40-minute mark, it becomes more serious, and the last hour plus of the film have some really wonderful moments in it, taking an unexpected thematic turn. A magical TV repair man (Don Knotts) places brother and sister David (Tobey Maguire) and Jennifer (Reese Witherspoon) into a 1950s sitcom called Pleasantville. The brother and sister are placed into the roles of the son and daughter on the sit-com, complete with their wholesome parents George (William H Macy), and Betty (Joan Allen) Parker. This black and white world soon turns to color as these innocent characters experience newfound passion towards aspects of life they weren't aware of before David and Jennifer arrived. Some members of the town are unhappy at the changes happening and try to stop it.The first act of the film is pure comedy, and by far, the worst part of the film. Whether it's purposeful or not, the color opening before the teens get thrown into the show is just plain ugly. It looks like a ""She's all That"" corny comedy, and the lines in these scenes are just as bad. Then we get the fish out of water portion of the film once the siblings arrive in the show, and that is nearly just as bad. Predictable, corny humor everywhere, in addition to almost theatrical overacting. Characters having sex in cars over exaggeratedly, and Reese Witherspoon's horribly written oversexed teenager character mixed together is almost cringe worthy. Then, oddly enough, once the movie settles into dramatic mode, it actually becomes really good. The subject matter becomes more interesting, as thematic connections to race relations in the 1950s show up, and the cinematography is at times really stunning. A scene where David sits with his television girlfriend by a lake in the rain is great looking, and sort of moving in a way. What this last 2/3rds of the movie has, that the first half doesn't is both a point, and a soul. Mr. Johnson (Jeff Daniels), the town soda shop owner, is really a large portion of the heart of the film. He begins to learn about paintings, and color, and begins wondering about what life truly is about, and his character has a completely natural, and unforced progression, with kind of an innocent wide eyed way about him. On the other side, we have Jennifer, who has a corny and stilted progression that doesn't really work, but luckily that's not a huge focus. The movie goes into ""racism"" territory, when the newly colored people are treated as second class citizens, by rule of the town council. And the movie goes into completely unpredictable territory, which makes this second half of the film all the more wonderful.The acting is very good, and is only dis-serviced by the script (especially early on). Almost every character is relatable in some way, through their own problems with change and over reliance on nostalgia. Jeff Daniels and Joan Allen are especially good, and work well together in the scenes that feature the two of them. Reese Witherspoon gives as fine a performance as she can, but her dialogue and character arc is pretty lame a lot of the time. She's clearly trying though. The music by Randy Newman is very fitting, and especially fits in during the more dramatic and moving scenes in the picture. The black and white and color mixture is often wonderful to look at, especially in the scenes that are making a point. Director/screenwriter Gary Ross has made a really bad late '90s comedy that turns into a pretty fantastic black and white (comedic) drama about the necessity of change and how people deal with it. After an ugly opening, the film looks great, and once it settles in, it becomes exciting, unpredictable and intelligent. If the first forty or so minutes were better, this would have been thoroughly wonderful. Alas that's not the case.My rating: *** out of ****. 124 mins. PG-13 for sexual and thematic elements.",Pleasantville
46,Boyo-2,Not a big deal,7,27 September 1999,"This movie was entertaining while I was watching it, and it was out of my mind completely the minute it was over.

The cinematography is the star of the movie, though, above the story and the actors.",Pleasantville
47,questl-18592,Pleasantville: So Much More than Pleasant,9,24 December 2020,"I love this movie. I've seen it probably a dozen times now and each time I feel like my appreciation of it only grows. There are so many layers to this, so much subtext and complexity. This most recent time it had me wondering if it's also addressing our own sense of nostalgia, how we think back on things in such simple terms and have such fondness for the good old days when life was easy until we actually stop and think, imagine what things were actually like and realize that things may not have been so simple but that's still ok because it's the complexity that makes life interesting.The cinematography is spectacular. The way they work with colors, the lack of colors, the makeup, the outfits, the... I just love this. If not for some pacing issues I'd say this is a perfect movie. It just drags a little here and there for me, it's super minor but it does always make me a little surprised when I read that it's only a 2 hour movie. Aside from that though, perfection.Hard recommend, go find it, buy it, watch it, love it.",Pleasantville
48,triple8,fascinating,8,26 December 2003,"I'd been hearing about Pleasantville for a long time and didn't even really know what it was about until I stumbled across it one night. Am I glad I did. What a DIFFERENT kind of movie. It was fascinating, and just really really well done. There's a bit of of a Stepford quality to this but it's less a thriller and more a fascinating and absorbing drama. Should be a must view for all people who like their teen movies on the complex side.I thought the contrast in the black and white and color-changing back and forth was just so well done and the effect was perfect for the movie. Pleasantville, although I had known of it before seeing it on television, isn't(or doesn't seem to be) that well known. Although this is really a movie for all ages, with all the garbage out there as far as teen movies go, Pleasantville is refreshingly different and thought provoking. Would definitely recommend. Will really make you think about life as you know it.",Pleasantville
49,Spleen,"More than merely pleasant - but that, too",9,27 July 1999,"This is a fantasy about two teenagers who get transported into the world of a 1950s TV show.Maybe I should repeat that sentence - you'd think it's the one fact about the film no-one could fail to notice; but apparently not.  Some people who ask the question, `What's the movie about?' aren't happy unless the response is full of abstract nouns.  Hence, I suppose, the misconception that it's really some kind of comment on America in the 1950s, or lost innocence, or some such.  Viewed that way the film is obviously weak and confused.  But it can only be read that way in wilful defiance of the evidence.  Respond to the fantasy first; hunt for metaphors later.View it properly and you'll notice that `Pleasantville' has nothing to do with a Vanished America or How Fictions Reconstruct Reality or Lost Innocence or any of that tiresome stuff.  It's really a story closely akin to Pygmalion.  (I'm talking Greek myth, not George Bernard Shaw.)  Or perhaps Pinocchio.  It's the story of people who have been created for the purposes of art - statues who have come to life - who gradually attain more and more humanity.  It's a story that can ONLY be told by means of fantasy. You'll notice that the central protagonists (the ones who were real all along) are, in a sense, not fully human either.  Indeed the David/Bud character starts out as one of the most stunted and unlikeable protagonists you're likely to find.  It's the film's triumph that we empathise with him in the end.It's also gorgeously shot.  (It mustn't have been easy - a combination of colour and black and white can so easily look a ghastly mess.)  Special effects show that some people, at least, know how to properly use computers for effect, and when not to use them.  None of the wonderful images was generated by computer - every one of them began as an image should begin, with light striking film.This is really lovely - and worth seeing on a big screen.",Pleasantville

51,Sandcooler,Insanely clever,8,16 October 2010,"This movie isn't as much a finished story as it is a wonderous collage of funny little things. Two kids from the MTV generation getting stuck in the unbearably pleasant world of a 50s television show is a truly brilliant concept, but it's the execution that's the real winner. I particularly loved the scenes that mixed B&W and color, not only because of the technical skills involved but mainly for what they represented. The intruders slowly cause a revolution among the villagers, a plot element that is absolutely beautifully done. Nothing burns in Pleasantville, there are no toilets, nobody knows what ""sex"" means, it's all just very witty. In the end few things are answered, but by then you just won't have the energy to be mad at the movie. Quite a good film.",Pleasantville
52,Matt_Layden,A Beautiful Film.,9,20 July 2009,"Before he was wearing tights and swinging from high rise buildings he was black and white and trapped in a town that was deemed perfect. Before she won an Oscar and dated an American psycho, she was a slutty sister who was trapped in a town that was deemed perfect. Oh yeah, the town was a fictional TV show called Pleasantville.This is the first film from Gary Ross, and I was surprised to learn it was his first directorial effort. The film feels like it was crafted by someone with year in experience in film-making. Sure he's written stuff before, like the Tom Hank comedy Big, but Pleasantville is something completely different. It's a film that works on so many different layers. It's a beautiful story and craft that work together to give us one of the best film to come out of the 90's.First, the cast is wonderful. The supporting cast is perfect and I thought William H. Macy delivers the hardest performance as the husband who doesn't want his wife to stray from her routine. Joan Allen plays the wife who discovers so many different things, one of them is self pleasure. Jeff Daniels works at a diner, but his true passion is painting.The most notable part of the film is the brilliant use of colour and black & white. If people have never seen this film, but loved the way Sin City was done, check out Pleasantville. It is one hundred times better and actually means something to the story, not just used for artistic flash. Not saying that that is a bad thing. I just think that the use of something as artistic as that that can drive a story is much more interesting that having it in there because it looks 'cool'.Even though it is billed as a comedy, I found it to be much more dramatic and more important that what people give it credit for. I think it has found it's audience now and is being remembered for what it should be instead of that film where they mix colour into black and white bits. This film is much more then that.Yes, this is one of the best films of the 90's and I recommend it with two big thumbs up.",Pleasantville
53,lewiskendell,"Black and white may be simple, but real life requires color.",6,29 October 2010,"""Fire! FIRE! ....Cat?""Cool movie. If you've ever found yourself wondering what it would be like to live inside one of those 50's family TV shows, Pleasantville has your answer. Absolutely absurd.Tobey Maguire and Reese Witherspoon play a pair of teenage siblings who end up inside the idyllic show of Pleasantville, in a town where there is no trouble, everything is predictable, innocent (separate beds for married couples) and the overall mood is (you guessed it) nothing short of blandly pleasant. They turn the black and white town upside down with sex and distinctly non-routine, non-Pleasantville ideas about life, and suddenly, color starts to seep into the world. Everyone doesn't like it, and Pleasantville starts to become a lot less pleasant. And the two teens end up go through some changes, themselves, of course.   The movie starts off fairly light-hearted, but goes in a much more serious direction as the story moves along. It was a good enough flick to keep me I interested even after the novelty started to wear off, but I do think it was a little longer than it needed to be. Overall, though, I thought it was pretty decent. There's a nice supporting cast of Joan Allen, William H.

This may not be the best movie I've seen, but it's certainly a pleasant way to spend a few hours.",Pleasantville
54,philip_vanderveken,A pleasant surprise,8,1 January 2005,"Already too often I've seen movies of which I thought: I've seen this concept so many times before, why do I actually keep watching? But from time to time, something original pops out. Pleasantville is one of those original movies.It's about two teenagers (brother and sister) with completely different characters. They hate each other, but get stuck in a fifties sitcom and will have to make the best out of it. Because her brother is a big fan of the show, he knows everything about the town and its inhabitants. At first it all seems perfect, but than they find out that the little ""paradise"" isn't that perfect at all and that it is really nothing more but a hollow shell without any meaning. Gradually they influence their new world in such a way that nothing is left of what it was like.This movie is actually a great satire. It shows that people have developed an idealistic image of the past that is far from the truth. Everything in the fifties was great, everybody was happy, it never rained, no-one had sex before marriage... It's all wrong, but today there are still people who think we all should go back to these moral standards. In fact this movie shows these people that that ideal image never existed, that there was racial hatred, that not everything went well... and we would never be able to live by those standards.What I liked so much about the movie was the way the perfect world was contrasted with the real world. The real world is in color and the perfect world in black and white. As the perfect world crumbles down, you get to see more and more colors. That's by far one of the most original ideas I've seen in any movie lately. Add to this a lot of good acting, a good pace and good directing and you know that you have found yourself a special movie. I reward it with an 8.5/10.",Pleasantville
55,moviewizguy,An Original Film,9,28 January 2007,"David watches television a lot and his favorite one is a sitcom, Pleasantville. Luckily, there's a trivia contest that he can win $1000 and a place to visit to. So on the day of the marathon of Pleasantville, her sister, Jennifer, is going on a date and they soon fight over a remote because her date is coming while he wants to watch the marathon.The remote ended up begin broken and weirdly, a TV repair guy shows up at their front door. He gives them a ""new"" remote and they ended up fighting again, teleporting the siblings to the 1950's sitcom where their influence begins to profoundly change that complacent world.This film is very good. It has an excellent score and great acting by the main cast. I have heard of this film when our English class was reading ""The Giver"", which has a similar theme. Our teacher showed us some clips of this movie and I decided to look this movie up and ended up watching it.The special effects were also great, leaving Pleasantville having colors and some having black and white. The film has great dialog and each cast member have their great moments.Pleasantville is unique, original, and fresh. It filled with emotion, humor, and political issues and overall, this is a great film.",Pleasantville
56,Lady_Targaryen,One of the first movies I watched with Tobey Maguire & Reese Witherspoon!,8,25 June 2009,"David and Jennifer are a brother and sister of the 90's. They have a terrible relationship with each other and with their parents, who doesn't care very much about them and are always discussing with each other. David loves to watch Pleasantville - a 1950's Black and White soap opera, where everything is perfect and everybody is sweet and polite with each other, what is totally different from the reality that he lives. One day, when they both are alone in their house, they broke the TV remote control in a fight, and a very strange repair man gives David a new remote that is capable of sending them (Jennifer and David) to the Pleasantville soap Opera, inside the TV.Trapped in a life of old fashioned values, they both need to live as Mary Sue and Bud to integrate themselves into this 50's life, so different from what they were used. What do they don't know, is the difference they will make to the Pleasantville's society and how this little society will also change them.I watched ''Pleasantville'' for the first time when I was 12, and I recently watched again with 23 years old. Even after one decade, the story continues to be good to me. I like very much the interesting metaphor of getting colored/changing inside, after doing something bold or having a challenge in your life.This film was one of the first I saw with Tobey Maguire and Reese Witherspoon( Who would say they would become such famous actors!) and I totally recommend to anyone who wants to watch an interesting and different movie.",Pleasantville
57,DeeNine-2,Becomes an unconscious parody of itself,7,18 September 1999,"The premise of Pleasantville seemed irresistible (another ""sure fire"" Hollywood idea), but the execution turned out to be not so easy. The problem is, it is very, very difficult to sustain a satire over an entire movie (although Kubrick did it in Dr. Strangelove); things can get especially confused if you try to make the satire into a morality tale with a ""pleasant"" ending, as Director Gary Ross does here. He knows that life is too complex for easy answers, and that seemed to be one of the things he was trying to say, e.g., monogamy is not necessarily superior to, or inferior to, adultery. Ditto for chastity and fornication. Rain for a change is nice.But he got confused somewhere along the way and ended up with a smug, sappy movie with ideas as shallow and black and white as the 50s milieu he was trying to satirize. The ""feel good"" ending is beyond redemption, in its way even sappier than the mythical sit-com it tries to improve upon. Yes, it is kind of neat to see things turn from black and white to color accompanied by stirring orchestral strings, especially as a result of something-like socking a bad guy in the jaw-that pleases one's prejudices. But where are the shades of gray? Not all red is fire engine red nor all blue, baby blue.Reese Witherspoon plays a skanky teen (Jennifer) who teaches (as Mary Sue) the Pleasantvillians to fornicate (and her TV mom to masturbate) while she learns that reading is worthwhile. Tobey Maguire plays her brother David/Bud who begins as a nerd, but ends up heroic, attractive to the opposite sex, and wise beyond his years. (Yes, and we live in the best of all possible worlds.) Strange how this movie manages to satirize itself.Joan Allen is grim as the stay-at-home sit-com housewife, and William H. Macy is appropriately bland as her simpleminded husband. Jeff Daniels as the soda jerk/artiste-and her unlikely lover-is tolerable.Through the film meanders a kind of confused extract of the Biblical story of the Garden of Eden. In the Bible, eating the fruit from the tree of knowledge of good and evil forever removed humans from paradise. In Pleasantville, knowledge of anything outside of town or of anything unpleasant has the same effect, while bestowing wondrous color. We even have a very red apple presented to Bud by his TV girl friend Margaret (played with wholesome sexiness by pretty Marley Shelton).What began to wear on me was the easy choice of target. Going after fifties-style prudery and conformity is like shooting fish in a barrel. I should add here that human desire is infinite: ""too much is never enough."" So perhaps it is better to start modestly with a soda at the soda fountain holding hands (the 50s style made fun of in the film) instead of immediately coupling below the dashboard with legs in the air (90s spin on same, lauded in the film).Gary Ross, for your next flick, how about taking aim at today's violent, mercenary, duplicitous society? Bring a cannon.(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book ""Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!"" Get it at Amazon!)",Pleasantville
58,RNMorton,"Smarmy, nasty movie",2,17 October 1999,"What a great idea - take two kids from the 90's and send them back 40 years or so. This could have been good comedy with some light social commentary thrown in. Instead, the script takes a decidedly unpleasant, disgustingly preachy turn - and suggests that moral folks of past generations are simply unenlightened boobs. The ""old folks"" may have been hypocritical in their own way, but to suggest that today's social fabric has lots of lessons for the past seems somewhat backwards. A major disappointment off a good premise.",Pleasantville
59,napierslogs,Altercation over continuity,10,8 October 2010,"""Pleasantville"" begins with two teenagers getting zapped into a TV show by a remote control. That kind of fantasy premise rarely plays out as something so good. What follows is an intelligent, funny and introspective examination of today's interpretation of 1950s sitcoms.Jennifer (Reese Witherspoon) and David (Tobey Maguire) are 90s teens, that are real and funny at the same time. She's a self-absorbed party girl; he's a nerdy home-body. He's ready to settle into a ""Pleasantville"" marathon - a black and white TV sitcom, but as laid out in the premise, they instead find themselves playing the brother and sister in the show.The film follows how their modern ways affect the characters in the show. Some characters go through a sexual awakening, others more of a cultural awakening, but they each mature and advance in their own way. Even David and Jennifer find that these TV sitcom characters have something to teach them. The film is just so smart and funny that it doesn't come across as melodramatic, and the lessons on society aren't in your face.""Pleasantville"" is beautifully shot and well written, and is far from the teen fantasy film that it sometimes gets advertised as. Highly recommended.",Pleasantville
60,kevin c,BACK IN TIME,7,25 September 2000,"I feel this film did not not succeed at the box office, because of comparisons with ""The Truman Show"". That's a shame, because this is an equally good film. An excellent cast are all on fine form. Maguire is increasingly producing some good work (catch ""Ride With The Devil""). The film questions traditional values and deals with themes such as integration and fascism. Not bad for a mainstream movie.",Pleasantville
61,Victor Field,A nice place to visit...,7,11 February 2002,"""Pleasantville"" has been described as a cross between ""The Truman Show"" and ""Back To The Future,"" but falls short of both - the former was sharper, the latter funnier, and both were more inventive (although ""The Twilight Zone""'s thematically similar ""A World Of Difference"" predates the adventures of Truman Burbank by about 40 or so years).You can't fault the acting or the setup (what would happen if two present-day people were zapped into an anodyne show from the past? Apparently things would start to become flawed - in other words, become just like us), and the colour effects are wonderful, both for their use and restraint (we only actually see a change from monochrome to colour once in the entire movie, making it all the more effective) - but Gary Ross, making his debut as a director after good work as a ""mere"" writer (""Big,"" ""Dave"" and - er - ""Mr. Baseball""), can't quite cover up some glaring problems with his tale. That there's no adequate explanation offered for how this comes about is fine (this is a fantasy, after all); that it gets sentimental is also no problem (I don't have a problem with schmaltz, as can be judged from the fact that I loved ""What Dreams May Come"").What IS a problem is that it's never explained how a place that's been in black and white since time began can a) know how to tell one colour from another and b) have any concept of colour to begin with; more seriously, the movie overdoes its racial allegory aspect (nowhere more so than in the courtroom climax)... and when you think about it, would it really have been so acclaimed if the situations had been reversed? A decent - very decent - but flawed effort.",Pleasantville
62,hall895,A surprisingly serious-minded success,7,12 May 2009,"1990s teens are magically sucked into their television set and end up living inside the world of a 1950s black and white sitcom. That sounds like a sure setup for some lighthearted comedic fare. But this movie goes in a different direction. Pleasantville has its funny moments but it's certainly not a typical comedy. It turns out to be a rather serious-minded film, a movie with a message. Some may quibble and say the film lays it on a bit thick, beating you over the head with its message. But all in all the film works. It's both enjoyable and thought-provoking and the premise ensures it will be rather unique.Tobey Maguire and Reese Witherspoon play the central roles of David and Jennifer, twins who have very little in common. Jennifer is concerned only with being popular. Her only goal in life is apparently to date, and sleep with, the resident hunk at the twins' high school. David on the other hand is a little awkward socially. As we meet him his big plans for the weekend consist of watching a marathon showing of reruns of his favorite 1950s sitcom, Pleasantville. To David, not entirely comfortable in the world in which he lives, Pleasantville seems like the ideal, perfect place where everyone is always happy and life is always wonderful. Then a television repairman, played by the always terrific Don Knotts, unexpectedly shows up and gives David a rather unusual looking remote control. One press of a button and David and Jennifer find themselves in Pleasantville. And David will soon see that the residents of this fictional black and white town desperately need some color in their lives. Things in Pleasantville are not as perfect as they seem.David and Jennifer find themselves living as Bud and Mary Sue, the children of the idyllic Parker family upon whom the sitcom centers. Once he comes to grips with the situation David can fall into his role rather easily as he knows absolutely everything about the sitcom, its characters and its world. Jennifer on the other hand is well and truly lost in this black and white world. Her brother insists that she must act as the sweet, innocent Mary Sue Parker would lest she upset the delicate balance of the wholesome Pleasantville world. But Jennifer is determined to bring some 1990s attitude to this 1950s world. And as it turns out that delicate balance in Pleasantville could use a little upsetting. Yes it appears to be an ideal place, everyone seems perfectly happy...but at what cost? They have no free will, no ability to affect their own lives. They go through the same mind-numbing routines day after day and never have any idea what they're missing. There's a great big world out there and perhaps with the influence of their visitors from the future the good folks of Pleasantville will finally have their eyes opened. Maybe for the first time they can really live rather than simply exist.It must be said that the process of bringing change to Pleasantville is a rather slow one. The film does proceed at a rather leisurely pace, seeming to drag at times. And some could have their own interpretations of the film's central message and see it as an attack on traditional values. But that's really not the case at all, it's about personal freedoms. Life is not going to be perfect, you have to take the bad with the good. But enough about the message, the film has so much more to recommend it. Perhaps the most notable feature of the film is the beautiful cinematography and wonderful effects. It may seem now that through computer effects all things are possible but when this film was made it was simply revolutionary. Vibrant color is brought into a black and white world, bit by bit, and the effect is stunning. And the whole story is performed beautifully by a terrific cast. Maguire and Witherspoon are excellent. In playing Bud and Mary Sue's father, a man very content is his predictable black and white life, William H. Macy is reliably brilliant. And Joan Allen and Jeff Daniels do perhaps the best work of all. Allen plays the sitcom mother and Daniels runs a diner and it is the way these two characters react to the changes in their world which gives the film much of its heart. But it is not just the 1950s characters who have changed, our teens from the 1990s evolve as well. It's a very smart, well-crafted story. It's not a perfect movie, there may be a few missteps along the way. But in the end a journey through Pleasantville is an enjoyable and rewarding experience.",Pleasantville
63,sharky_55,Honey! I'm home.,8,12 May 2016,"The key theme in Pleasantville is that you do not turn colour until you have truly been set free, until you have broken the shackles of your confinement and step out of your pre-defined mould (utopia as dystopia). On face value this seems a little confusing; after all Jennifer doesn't seem to do anything much than start reading and studying, somehow magically struck by the nerd gene and gaining her pigment and redemption. On a closer look, this seems to be linked to the cultural and artistic explosion that occurs in Pleasantville with their arrival - Mr Johnson's multicoloured murals, the books and their spontaneously appearing stories and illustrations, the rock-and-roll tracks that suddenly creep up onto the buttons of the jukebox. David goes through the opposite transformation. A cleverly edited sequence of faux-intimate closeups at the beginning establishes his loser, outsider status. We expect him to burst with colour as soon as he makes the changes and gets Bud to receive Margaret's cookies. But it is actually an act of bravery, in taking on the 'bullies' that harass her coloured mother that sees him undergo the same change. No doubt they are carbon copies of the brutes back in high school in the real world. Gary Ross' imagery is clear and clean cut, which is probably why this has been studied in schools. The colour is a delightful and distinct way of representing freedom and blossoming. First it starts with just a red rose after a sexual awakening - a double meaning, with the petals also flowering and blossoming. And you have all the sexual undertones that go with roses and 'pins' and cherries. The splashes of colour are applied to other concepts - a buzzing clock, to signify time (and the town) finally moving forwards after years of stasis, a burning bush for orgasmic clarity of thought (biblical reaching here to the apple and the idea of 'knowledge is power') and eventually, a historical mirroring of events that are not so long and completely gone. There is a brilliant allusion here to To Kill a Mockingbird, with the 'coloured' congregated in the upstairs level of the court. What's also wonderful is the use of humour to flip our expectations. Ross has more or less established the conventions of the Pleasantville restrictions by the time we dive into the screen, but it is nevertheless hilarious when a player missed a shot and the team stares incredulous at the defective ball like it was a ticking bomb, or when Jennifer hurries off to the bathroom and find each stall utterly empty. Mr Johnson is so helpless and trapped within routine that he has taken to rubbing the same spot at the bar over and over. But by the end of the film he sits on one end of the bench. Personal and political repression has been replaced by freedom to choose...they have no idea what their roles are or how this particular episode might end...but that is the beauty in it.",Pleasantville
64,CharltonBoy,Not everything is black and white!,7,21 April 2000,Pleasantville is story of how peoples perseptions of a perfect life are not always as perfect as they seem.It is the story of a brother and sister who get sucked into a tv show about a pleasant town with perfect people who lead angelic lives and how the two peoples values and own way of life gradually rub off.If this is for the better it is up to you to judge . The transision from old pleasantville to the new pleasantville is very clever . The old turn from black and white into colour to show the progression.

The inhabitants of Pleasantville are clueless to any world outside of their black-and-white existence.  No free-will, no sex, no art, nada.  But what a nice group they are nonetheless.  And as the two teens set out to teach them all that they're missing, slowly, the black-and-white Pleasantville turns to color.  It's not all peaches and cream however, there's unpleasantness in Pleasantville, and this is where the movie almost loses itself.  It becomes somewhat preachy, massing imagery on Nazis, southern bigots, women's liberation, et al into a series of scenes that almost upturns the movie.  Almost, but not quite.I recommend this movie highly.",Pleasantville

67,harry-76,Provocative Film,1,12 December 2000,"Who ever would have thought a seemingly ""innocent"" little satire like ""Pleasantville"" could bring up such a multitude of strong personal thoughts and emotions?  The film's basic premise is moot . . . rather like saying an adult is ""superior"" to a child.  It's no great accomplishment for one with a fifty year advantage to look back and down upon one's '50s predecessors.  Children are expected to stand on the shoulders of their parents and surpass them in awareness and performance.What becomes a real ""copout"" is to support condemnation, ridicule and judgement of our ancestors . . . all the while ignoring the faux pas of our own culture.  Sure, it's much easier to externally blame than it is to take responsibility for our own experience.I failed to ""buy into"" the philosophy of ""Pleasantville,"" finding it skewed and sour.  It's inference that color is somehow better than black and white, or that the latter is equated with the sterile, closed minded, naive and stark, while the former is beautiful, lifelike, rich and rewarding--is spurious and fallacious.Out with Vaughn Monroe, in with the Stones.  I feel fortunate indeed to discern artistic quality, even from a pop music perspective, and turn away from the raucous, discordant, and grating as being out of harmony with the human soul.  Ditto for the dazzling Disney-type distractions, the surface glitter of high tech commercial packagings, and the myriad of clever but vacuous products being sold to the public today. Let others revel in this foolishness.  I'm going my own way ... in the opposite direction of the ideology of ""Pleasantville.""",Pleasantville
68,aesgaard41,Excellant Movie,10,2 January 2004,"I like this movie, I really do. I mean, there are TV Series that are made into movies and then there are movies made about TV. Tobey McGuire (pre-Spiderman) and Reese Witherspoon (pre-Legally Blonde) play a brother and sister who are sucked into an old Fifties series through the magic of Don Knotts who is so wonderfully cast. Instead of going through the farce of meeting the Cleavers or the Andersons (the Bewitched house appears in the background once), they start bringing the real world into the show with them. First it starts out by accident, and then it turns into a new fad among the citizens of Pleasantville. It's a bit Kafkaesque and a bit Twilight Zone as Reese first hates what has happened and then gradually accepts it. Tobey is wonderful and perfectly cast as he issues just the right amount of awe and wonder for the role. Reese and Marley Shelton (Sandlot) are both very beautiful actresses who further heighten the mood for me. The movie as a matter of fact returns the silver screen to the magic and innocence of movies from the Forties. A few dangling plot points leave me wondering if the Reese and Tobey's mother (Jane Kaczmarek, Malcom in the Middle) ever realize they are gone ? Is this like The Lion, The Witch and The Wardrobe where no matter how long you're gone, you only return a few minutes after you left ? Does Pleasantville join the real world or does it just update itself in whatever reality it exists ? It probably doesn't matter. I'd watch this movie over and over for Reese anyway.",Pleasantville

However, I saw part of the film again on television earlier this year, and I did not think that it was nearly as bad as my impression of it when I was 20. I think a lot of the impression of the film was that it seemed to be a little bit dull, plus the film's main focus is about sex and corruption. The film is about a teenage boy, who is a bit old-fashioned, and his sister. The two get transported back into the 1950s on the set of the show where everything is wonderful and a utopia until they come along. The problems start with the boy's sister, who introduces the old-fashioned and laid back people to sex and fun, which ultimately leads to affairs and prejudice. I did not care for the message, but I did think that the film had an original idea, and for that, it will get points.",Pleasantville

It is good to show that sin is also part of our life and without there won't be failure and success, love and hate, and sex and adultery. It is true that TV several times tries to create fictitious paradise in its programs as it is the case of pleasantville, but the reality is different, and this is well explained here.

The main problem is that this film gets worse as it goes along.  The film started off as a comedy, and it was often hilarious. Almost every joke seemed to work, and the attention that was paid to detail made for a magnificent first half.  Unfortunately, the film gradually switched from comedy to drama, and the dramatic parts were very hit-and-miss.  As the townspeople became more alive, the film became less lively.  The dramatic parts were okay, but they paled sharply in comparison to the stellar comedic moments that had dominated much of the movie.  It's just too bad that a movie that could've been nearly perfect faltered with a final hour that was merely ""pleasant"".",Pleasantville
72,Isaac5855,A brilliant and vastly underrated cinematic experience,8,23 October 2006,"PLEASANTVILLE had to be one of the biggest surprises I've ever had at the movies. This superbly mounted and completely winning fantasy starred Toby Maguire and Reese Witherspoon as a contemporary teenage brother and sister who are magically transported into a black and white television show called ""Pleasantville"", a show similar to ""Leave it to Beaver"" or ""I Love Lucy"", where everyone in the town knows each other, where the fire department only saves cats from trees and never put out fires and where there are no pages in the books or toilets in the bathrooms. Maguire's character is a ""Pleasantville"" trivia expert so he knows everyone there and everything that's going to happen but sis Witherspoon is a stranger in a strange land whose introduction of 1990's sensibilities to the citizens of this town brings about extraordinary changes. The film is beautifully made with a very smart screenplay and superb performances, the best of which is by Joan Allen, who is luminous as Betty, the mother in the sitcom who is shocked at first but learns to accept the 1990's coming to Pleasantville. Yes, it may borrow from other movies, but there is a freshness and originality to this movie that is most engaging and anytime with Don Knotts is time well spent.",Pleasantville
73,emm,Creativity sparks a fantasy through time and transition.,8,19 April 1999,"Don't we all wish the world is pleasant again, even in the year 2000? It's too bad the clock doesn't turn back to the good old days of prosperity. Now we are left behind with artifacts of memories that once was. Remember the milkman, the paperboy, the wife who always prepares the dinner table.PLEASANTVILLE is an entertaining nostalgic trip back in the days of black-and-white television shows, and fantasizes the past pop culture through a deep blending of a modern-day unruly society. It sounds like a new and rewarding concept, and it goes even further by examining two different worlds: the happy, shiny, rock n' roll 50s and the dark, decaying, alternative 90s. Writing and direction have its bold merits, expressing a masterful view of moral values in a properly known fictional town called Pleasantville. If we wanted to escape the world where sex and violence would create a problem, then this is the right place to be. Rather, this is a movie to watch because it will stir some deep emotions for choosing to look back into a bygone era when life was enjoyed peacefully. Emotions alone wouldn't have been totally necessary for a movie like this, which focuses on the 50s way of living. In the end, the importance lies within the history to be remembered, and how it builds up into the present, and even the future. But the movie wouldn't have been anywhere near as pleasant without Don Knotts, magnificently cast as a handy-dandy ""reliable"" TV repairman stuck in the tube.Originality aside, PLEASANTVILLE whisks us away when we think about the wonderful possibilities life had accomplished, and how changes in society must always phase. And remember to think about your affections over positive values that sure would be needed right now. A winning treat that comes out satisfying.",Pleasantville

I say surprisingly as a priori I expected very little, but got a few laughs out of it. Earmarking inward-looking self-complacency and parrochial mentalities so often evident in so-called well-heeled societies, and carrying it to a rather overblown degree is hardly a way of making anything be convincing. However, evidently, that was not Ross's intention: but the allegory is clear. And well done. My only real complaint is that he should have cut all the dialogues during those minutes in which Dave Brubeck's `Take Five' could be heard. Not that the dialogue was bad, but Brubeck's piece is always worth a good listen. The ending is certainly a failure, not at all in keeping with the rest of the film. Somewhat spoiled the effect.

The story is one of fantasy and definitely takes some suspension of reality, but is done quite well.  The story is very much about change and the things that happen around us all the time and learning to cope and deal with those changes.  The film takes a very odd and interesting route to convey that message.All the actors did a fantastic job, Tobey Maguire, Reese Witherspoon, Jeff Daniels, Joan Allen, Marley Shelton, J.T.

77,Horror-yo,"Very good for 2/3's, ruined in last act",6,29 March 2017,"So obviously reading just the synopsis you understand the sort of film this is going to be: metaphorical, proverbial, working on two levels, that sort of thing...So the film does well jumping straight right into its plot, almost too quick perhaps but the whole first part and middle part are really well made. You're right in the thick of what the movie-makers set you up for, and you find yourself willing to play the little game to see just where exactly they're taking you. It's lots of fun, and the anticipation for answers is at a high level. The whole thing with the colors, the symbols, the 'changes'...Eventually, the last act, about the whole last third, gets increasingly disappointing as it goes. Very broadly, instead of a deeper unraveling of the concept of truth or something along those lines of philosophical nobility and wisdom and touching, we're fed a totally biased ideological realization of the plot. All of a sudden, it feels a bit like a hoax to have been sitting for two hours plus of this. It ultimately promotes chaos and going wild and doing just what you want solely because you want it at that time. Basically the whimsy responsibility-free behaviors of adults of our day. Now that can't be a good message.Some points for the intriguing, genuinely interestingly crafted first part, but it could and should've been plenty deeper in its conclusions, kept its level quality from the first to the last part, and most certainly should've had an ending at least the quality of the girth of it, rather than the girth being much better. It's wrapped up, manufactured and rushed into our faces like a mere consumable product when it's supposed to be deep and emotional and intellectual and all.6/10.",Pleasantville
78,thejcowboy22,There is no right life!,5,4 April 2017,"One night I had a very unusual dream. I was coming home from my Parochial school on a cloudy afternoon. My bus driver took a different route home and I kept my mouth shut figuring he knew a better way, short cut so to speak. Low and behold we pull up to the House of Samantha Stephens of the popular TV show Bewitched. My Bus driver yelled at me to get off the bus, ""This is your house."" I'm not one to argue so I stepped off and walked up the driveway with my briefcase in hand and rang the bell. The front door opens and a I get a warm friendly greeting from Samantha as I'm pleasantly in shock but I respond by saying, ""Your Elizabeth Montgomery Right?"" Samantha with a dumbfounded looks says, ""I don't know any Elizabeth whoever but come in and let me take your briefcase."" She knew my name but my last name was Stephens? I see Tabatha in the background but alas I had woken into my hum drum world. Reality hit me like a hammer on my thumb. We always feel like the grass is always greener on the other side instead of taking stock in what we have or what we haven't seen on the other side. Pleasantville at the source of this narrative is the perfect Utopia, Garden of Eden,perfect town with perfect people. Tobey Mcquire plays Pleasantville aficionado David who is categorized as a nerd in his high school. Not by any means one of the popular kids in school. Yet David is looking forward to the fictional TV program Pleasantville to air a marathon of episodes starting at 6:30 that evening. Enter popular Blonde,wild,close in age Sister Jennifer (Reese Witherspoon).The two siblings fight over the TV remote which breaks. Our third player is a crusty old TV repair man (Don Knotts) with a most unusual clicker in his possession. One thing leads to another and the two are zapped into the black and white fifties world of Pleasantville. Director Gary Ross goes to tremendous expense to show how a stagnate world can't exist.Ross holds the utopia ideology up for ridicule as the movie wears on. The regulars in this show Joan Allen and husband Bill Macy handle change and awakening in totally different ways. Allen embraces the idea but the husband wants everything status quo. The Hamburger flipping Mr. Johnson played by Jeff Daniels wonders if it's ethical to put cheese on hamburgers and his secret love of art is discovered which give his life more meaning. Each individual gets colorized as an Epiphany occurs within themselves. Discovering one's sexuality seem to change the masses but in Jennifer's case it was the thirst for knowledge and books that changed her. The gradual colorization represented the struggles of racism in that supposed Garden of Eden. As perfect as the Tobey Mcquire was in the fictitious town it was time to come home to present day life. One of the last scenes in the movie is the conversation between David and his real Mom in which she wondered how her life is so screwed up.David's Mom goes on how at one time her life was perfect but David who has lived both sides in and out of the TV box states, ""There is no Right House. There is no right car!"" To quote a fellow critic Mr. J. Dukes,"" Sometimes the part of ourselves are the ones we leave unexplored."" Great thought provoking movie.",Pleasantville

81,SKG-2,"Great technically, great acting, but heavy-handed",8,2 February 1999,"This film is a little overrated as far as I'm concerned.  Technically, yes, the transitions between black-and-white and color are tremendous and stunning to look at.  And the cast is excellent; in addition to the two teen leads, I particularly liked Joan Allen (whose bath scene is one for the books) and Jeff Daniels (who remembers restraint here).  And I hope Marley Shelton (she plays the girl in Pleasantville who falls in love with Bud) goes on to bigger things; she's beautiful and shows great acting promise.  But it just seemed that director Gary Ross laid it on too thick.  The climatic court scene had ""This is where we preach to you"" written all over it, and some of the other scenes did as well.  This is not to say this is a bad film, it just didn't wow me like it seems to have wowed others.",Pleasantville
82,AKS-6,Wonderful,7,10 October 1999,"What can you say about the premise of ""Pleasantville"" apart from that it is brilliant? The idea of two American teenagers getting stuck in an old TV show and that not only the people of that isolated world start to change, but that the teenagers also start to realize that there are things about themselves that they never would have known if they had not come to Pleasantville is in short brilliant. It's just such a fantastic story and Gary Ross certainly made a film that lived up to the high expectations of the premise. I must admit that I really like movie fantasy fairy tales (like ""Time Bandits"" for example), but ""Pleasantville"" is a wonderful film in its own right.William H. Macy, Joan Allen, J.T. Walsh and Jeff Daniels are all very good. Tobey Maguire is great, as is Reese Witherspoon. I've only seen Witherspoon in one other movie -- ""Freeway"" -- but I still think she is very talented.In short, ""Pleasantville"" is a delightful and wonderful and very funny fantasy comedy and I thoroughly recommend it.",Pleasantville
83,MelbaMan1,Emotionally Uninvolving,7,16 May 2018,Incredible production values. Toby Maguire holds everything together. Half an hour too long. Movie's premise not deep enough for 2 hours. Maybe it (the premise) needed to be expanded. David (Bud) hasn't come back to a different situation at the end. Why didn't I get emotionally involved with it?

A movie like this would be great in the 50s, or if it were shot under a totalitarian rule, where people would be so suppressed. But now, it's only about the minority who don't get it yet. It's an ode to obvious, or maybe for everyone to appreciate what they consider as given. About the film itself, we have a nice scenario, although quite a few times slipping to naivety, nice performances and great effects.

85,chrisbrown6453,"Pleasantville was a movie I was looking forward to since I first saw the previews for it a few months ago. And it didn't disappoint. It was a well made, well acted film, that while at times beat you over the",7,17 June 2002,"Tobey Maguire and Reese Witherspoon play David and Jennifer, two all-American kids growing up in today's world. Jennifer is the ""cool"" kid, while David is, well, not. While Jennifer is into trying to get guys, and smoking and all that, David is into watching tv, especially his favorite tv show, Pleasantville. Tonight David and Jennifer have slightly different plans. David is planning on watching a 24 hour marathon of Pleasantville, while Jennifer is planning on watching a concert on MTV with this guy she's invited over. During their squabble over the all-mighty remote, it breaks, and a mysterious stranger is at the door (Don Knotts). He hands them a new remote that changes their lives forever. Somehow David and Jennifer get zapped into the tv, and are now part of Pleasantville.
Pleasantville (the tv show) is an old black and white wholesome show where the father comes home from work everyday at 5, his wife has prepared dinner for them, and the two kids rush over to see daddy. The temperature never goes above or below 72 degrees, and life is well, pleasant. David and Jennifer (who are now Bud and Mary Sue) have to deal with this new life, while trying to figure a way out. Soon the black and white world of Pleasantville is turning colorized, and people aren't sure what to do. Is this change a good thing, or will it ruin the lives of the people of Pleasantville? There are a few obvious messages screenwriter/director Gary Ross is trying to show. So I'll just tell you what I got out of it. Basically I thought he was trying to say that people need to express themselves. Your world will remain in black and white unless you're willing to open your eyes to new experiences. Once you start seeing what the world around you has to offer, your once black and white world can open up into a rainbow of colors. Of course Ross could have been trying to say that being an individual is important rather than always following what the group says. Or he could have been saying, ""can't we all just get along?"" Whatever his real message was, he certainly hits his point, over and over and over again. I though I was pretty smart picking up on his message (something I usually don't see) early on in the film. Then for the last 30-45 minutes, he just kept slamming his message into you again and again. And while I didn't feel that he needed to, it didn't really take away from the movie. The black and white vs. color idea was something different. The special effects were quite cool in fact. Seeing how the world of Pleasantville slowing transformed, flower by flower, face by face, into color was very interesting. Although for a while it seemed the only way a person could turn into color was by having sex (an idea later refuted by Mary Sue). The acting was wonderful, and it was all held together by Tobey Maguire. His character (David/Bud) had a powerful yet boyish innocence about him. He knew the tv show so well he knew what all the people were supposed to be doing, yet after trying desperately to keep them in line, he realized that maybe change was a good thing. The one character that truly showed how change can affect you was the mom Betty Parker (Joan Allen). Her performance showed how change can be exciting and at the same time frightening. It was funny to see how all the kids changed into color first, while all the older white males were the last to go. It tells me that the kids of today are more willing to go out there and make changes, and that we are the voice of a new world. But those older white guys will come along, once they realize that maybe kids have something important to say. So overall, I really enjoyed Pleasantville. It was well made, and well acted. And while it did beat you over the head with its many messages, the story was still done in such a way that I didn't really mind it. It's a movie that I'll probably see again.",Pleasantville
86,DavidSim240183,"A rich, deeply textured portrait of suburban conformism vs individual escapism",10,23 November 2006,"Pleasantville is a truly extraordinary experience. Not to mention rewarding. Far more than you might imagine. It really is a wonderful film. I can't praise it enough. It is so good. And intelligent. And entertaining. All qualities in short supply in films nowadays but are in Pleasantville by the bucketload.Pleasantville was a little overshadowed in 1998 by The Truman Show, even though they're equally great films. But although they cover similar ground, they are quite different. They share the same conceit of television thrust upon the unsuspecting individual, but the worlds they inhabit are diametrically opposed. Truman's world was an artificial construct designed for him to interact with. But in the case of Pleasantville, this is a self-contained world with actual people who inhabit it. But all within the boundaries of television programming.Pleasantville is actually a 1950s sitcom. A cosy, b/w world of picket fences, malt shops and bowling alleys. Everyone is happy. Everyone lives normal, untroubled lives. The weather is always perfect. And the people are perfectly content.In our world, David (Tobey Maguire) is a social outcast at school. And he has a distant relationship with his Mum and rebellious sister Jennifer (Reese Witherspoon). His only means of escape is the uncomplicated world of Pleasantville. While waiting for a Pleasantville marathon, a TV repairman turns up, and gives David a new remote control. When Jennifer wants to watch something else, they fight over the remote, and end up zapped inside Pleasantville.Taking on the characters of Bud and Mary-Sue, David and Jennifer begin to explore this new world. Their fictional parents are George and Betty Parker (two wonderful performances from William H Macy and especially Joan Allen). George is the strait-laced Father Knows Best, and Betty is the happy homemaker. But they're not really people. They're two-dimensional characters inhabiting a flat, insular, sexless, joyless environment.The first half of the film is enjoyable because it allows us time to speculate what the film might be about. Perhaps a witty, even gently scathing satire on classic American sitcoms and family values. Where these people are so touching in their naiveté, and so willing to believe in the noble intentions of others. But as the film progresses, it soon becomes more than enjoyable. It becomes extraordinary.Jennifer is unhappy. Geography lessons only consist of the world of Pleasantville. Books have no writing in them. Parents sleep in separate beds. And no-one has ever heard of sex. Jennifer changes that when she introduces the concept of sex to the captain of the basketball team. In Pleasantville, nobody ever loses at basketball. They make a basket every time. But now, after having sex, the captain misses. And that's only the beginning.David and Jennifer's presence begins to introduce startling changes. The kids are the first ones to notice. The basketball team are now missing almost every time. They're all discovering the sexual act. And their behaviour is starting to change. They actually now have a thirst for knowledge. After Jennifer accidentally introduces them to the joys of reading, now that the books are no longer blank, the kids want to learn more about the world beyond Pleasantville. A concept completely alien to them before.The characters of Pleasantville are beginning to think for themselves. They're becoming self-aware. And eventually, their self-discovery develops to the point where they're no longer two-dimensional, b/w caricatures. But fully realised, three-dimensional, in-colour, individuals.Director Gary Ross is careful the way he introduces colour into the picture. It happens gradually. Like a red rose in a grey flower-bed. Or a green neon sign in a b/w background. The way colour is utilised in this film is superb. The in-colour people stand out with an astonishing beauty. Or the breathtaking scene when David is driving through a b/w grove showered by pink cherry blossoms. Those scenes resonate with a vitality that is just wonderful to watch.Eventually the adults start to catch on too. It's marvellously satisfying when Betty learns about orgasms from Jennifer, and as she slowly breaks out of the confines of her character, she eventually learns the joy of thinking for one's self. Initially when she goes to colour, she at first tries to hide it with makeup.But when she meets Mr Johnson (Jeff Daniels), the owner of a diner, she starts to reconsider her position. Mr Johnson discovers self-awareness through artistic expression. He loves to paint now that colour has entered the world of Pleasantville. And when he paints a portrait of Betty, she comes to cherish her individuality.Because of the sweeping changes, not everyone welcomes them. Big Bob (J T Walsh's final film role), the mayor insists on things staying the way they always have. And unites the people against the 'coloureds.'First and foremost, Pleasantville is a film of ideas. And its never short of them. Gary Ross manages to find an astonishing level of nuances, as well as a rich subtext. Covering everything from racism, feminism, teenage rebellion, homosexuality, sexual awareness and so on. It communicates the ideal of the sharing of new ideas through art, philosophy, literature, and how change is necessary for a society to survive. The people in b/w represent those opposed to change. The acting is wonderful throughout, and I love the way the people become proud of their new identities:George: ""Betty, whatever's happening to you. It will go away."" Betty: ""What if I don't want it to go away?""The final scenes are exhilarating, as the whole town goes to colour. It appears so vibrant and beautiful, my heart soared with joy. The music is perfectly matched to the tone as well, creating joyous surges of well-being. I could go on praising Pleasantville all day. I love it so much. A true, modern classic. And a potent, symbolic message of hope and new ideals.Wonderful! Simply wonderful!",Pleasantville
87,moviemanMA,All is well in Pleasantville...,10,1 July 2005,"The premise of Pleasantville is one that is both ingenious and imaginative. Without a doubt, this is one of the most underrated films of its generation. With great visual effects and a plot that ranks up there with Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, this movie is a joy to watch. In a world so concerned with self image preservation of youth, people have began to miss out on what is beautiful in life. This movie truly shows what to do and how to change your bad habits. In the beginning of the film, Tobey Maguire and Reese Witherspoon are brother and sister. Magurie is the geeky know it all of the classic television show Pleasntville and his sister Witherspoon is the sometimes slutty and always self absorbed teen. Due to the remote control breaking and the coincidence of have a TV repairman right at the door, the new remote isn't an ordinary remote. The two are transported into the television, specifically Pleasntville. The two are changed into character, the two children, Bud and Mary Sue, of the Parker family. Now they must find out how to contact the repairman who is distraught over their anger with their new position. The only way to go on living is as the beloved characters of Pleasantville. Now the real fun starts. They begin to show the town what living really is. Jenny (Witherspoon) shows the town sex and David (Maguire) introduces the world of literature and art to the townspeople. With this new way of life, the black and white world of Pleasantville is beginning to turn into color. The local burger joint is run by Bill Johnson played wonderfully by Jeff Daniels. He brings to life a sort of insecurity to what would be a normal situation like making burgers. Daniels is perfect for the role. Other notables are William H. Macy, Joan Allen, Paul Walker, and J.T. Walsh perform marvelously to create a surreal way of life in Pleasantville.Overall, the movie lacks luster in no department. Acting, cinematography, story, and of course, entertainment are all here.

The depth of its analysis on how we judge others, how we facet ourselves to fit, on bigotry, education, and civil society is well hidden by an all enveloping funny light tirade.Anyone can enjoy the humor of the movie, which has a rib-cracking prevalence in the beginning. However, if you so choose, you can easily explore all the issues it brings up as the story line develops.All the characters are well played. Tobey McGuire is certainly giving a much better performance than in any of his Spiderman movies where there's little room for psychological development. Reese Witherspoon is adorable as she explores the evolving duality of Jennifer. And Joan Allen will tug at each and every one of your sensible chord.Visually, its all subtleties and perfection.

Really the only things that don't work for this film are the heavy-handedness of the happy ending - way too cheezy - and Tobey Maguire - who I really, really, really, really don't like. Everyone else in the cast is fantastic and the story, when it's subtle, is right on. But the real highlight of this film is the stunning visual effects. The gradual change from black and white to colour is superbly executed and makes for some very visually striking moments. It's one thing to see colour inserts in a black and white film - that's nothing new - but it's quite another to see black and white inserts in a colour film. And the way that the gradual turn into colour is actually the story as well - fantastic.

In a cast that was excellent all around including Tobey McGuire & Reese Witherspoon before either of them were big stars I have to give special props to Jeff Daniels & Joan Allen. I have yet to meet anyone that doesn't think this is an extremely good film. The way all of the characters interact is what makes this such a special film. I honestly don't know how this didn't make at least twice as much money as it did, because it's that original. If you haven't seen it, do yourself a favor & watch it & I dare you not to be impressed. I would especially recommend this to fans of 1950's & 60's shows such as ""The Andy Griffith Show"" & ""The Dick Van Dyke show. Have fun & be prepared to be very impressed w/the originality & the tremendous performances by the huge & fabulous cast.",Pleasantville
93,trpdean,Moving but Overly Broad Social Criticism in Comedy (spoilers),4,8 September 2001,"I just rented Pleasantville and was very moved by it. If you're wondering whether to see it, please do. It's somewhat similar in feel to The Truman Show - a warm comedy that conveys social criticism. That's why I just rented them both for the first time and watched them back to back - and much preferred Pleasantville as more profound, funnier, and having more original writing.However, at times Pleasantville is a little odd. First, it may well rub people the wrong way (it did me) that indiscriminate nightly recreational sex by teenagers is seen as causing them to flower into real people. Thus, a teenager contracting a venereal disease becomes the amusing equivalent to lipstick found on someone's collar. Well, it isn't. It's bothersome that this is seen as meaning the teenagers have somehow acquired ""real life"" and flowered.Similarly, the infidelity of the perfect suburban wife is seen as completely wonderful - the horrific impact on the husband shown merely comically because dinner isn't ready.Somehow, the town's negative reaction to a nude painting of the wife by her lover on the windows of the local hangout is seen as perverse. The writer/director sees the painting as just a wonderful expression of a long repressed artistic sensibility. Hmmm - imagine YOUR mother painted naked on the storefront window! You wouldn't want it to remain there!Similarly, character after character responds enviously when presented with the idea that there is a more ""dangerous"" world out there. Well, I wish there were less danger in the world - less likelihood of disease, of murder, of ruinous bankruptcies of people's hopes, of litigation that drives people under, of unemployment, of infidelity. These are terrible things - they ruin and end lives. That doesn't mean I want a controlled environment - but only that it is hard to imagine anyone wishing for life to be MORE dangerous.
Moreover, much of the social criticism is blunted by the fact that many of the oddities the characters find about their situation are not because they are in the 1950s, but because they are in the midst of a television show rather than real life. Thus, ALL books have blank pages, there is no known place outside that town, all basketballs swish through the hoops, everyone's routine is so rigid that the soda fountain worker is unable to cope when a worker fils to show up in time to fold the napkins while he begins cooking.
The question thus becomes whether the director is satirizing merely television shows. But if it is merely a satire of old television programs, it is strange. On Leave it to Beaver or Father Knows Best or Donna Reed or My Three Sons, the characters OFTEN failed - and the inevitable moral lesson about trying again or keeping one's chin up was the point of the show.
If instead, it is social commentary about conformity and repression (as the movie's point appears more to be), then the oddities of being inside a television program unfortunately vitiate the point of the movie.
I also have a problem with a movie that confuses expression with libertine behavior. It's one thing to be free to draw any picture - it's another for teenagers to contract venereal diseases through indiscriminate sex. They AREN'T the same things, and making it appear that those who are confused when their wives have simply abandoned them and their children without even a note, with those who are violent book burners or utterly rigid conformists, is really hitting too broadly.All that said, the movie was terribly moving in showing those in a conformist society finding themselves bloom, and  the confusion and shock and anger that this causes among others. It's sweet and funny, and I particularly liked how well drawn the two leads were - quite distinct people who react very differently to the situation.It's interesting that Toby McGuire begins by trying his utmost not to upset the existing conformist social order (his sister doesn't care at all), but ends completely believably as the revolutionary subverter of that order. The movie is well worth seeing even if you think the director insists on throwing out the morality of fidelity along with the bathwater of mindless rigid conformity.",Pleasantville

95,smakawhat,"Brilliantly overlooked, a gem",10,7 May 2000,"Toby and Resse, as David and Jennifer, are teenagers growing up in 90's USA. The begining of the movie starts off describing the life they live in.  A school counsleor lectures them on how the chances of them finding a job when the graduate after college (assuming they can pay for it) are to decrease with time, 1 in 150 Americans will contract AIDS, and that the ozone layer will be gone within 15 years.  Dave lives with his divorced mom and finds solace in an old TV show.  David watches a TV show on a station that specialises in old 50's tv sitcoms.  The show that David knows everything about is ""Pleasantville"" an old total Leave it to Beaver type show with, the perfect plastic family, including the twin beds and white picket fence of course..  A marathon is about to be on the show which also has a contest where someone could win $1000 dollars.  Hence Dave is set to watch the marathon and escape the world he lives in, and to favour a world where everything is perfect and nothing goes wrong.  However, he and his sister end up in Pleasantville when a repair man comes to fix their TV and are magicaly transported there.  Thus the kids 90's value system clashes with old 50's standards as they try to figure out how to survive.The thing about this movie is that it sets itself up first as a goofy stupid comedy, like that John Ritter movie ""Stay Tuned"", where he got trapped in TV as well which was HORRID.  However, I kept reading reviews about how everyone loved this film and that it was the most overlooked movie of 1998.  And this movie is very special, it evolves into something else.  As Jennifer ends up sleeping with the head of the basketball team, things change.  Colour starts to appear and people start questioning things particularly the kids.  Why do all the books have nothing printed in them?  What is sex?  And what is outside Pleasantville?This film is really sly, I loved how it kept surprising me all the time and evolving.  It sets itself up as a comedy and you think you're going to get a lesson in how things back then were better since the movie starts off so pessimisticaly.. but then it digs more.. You learn things back in the 50's WEREN'T that great.. McCarthyism, sexual represion, cold war hostilities, juvenille delinquecies, and racial tension that had yet to explode.  It is awesome.  Toby does a good job here cause he plays an insecure teenager and it works unlike his role in Cider house rules (which was a total disaster). Resse is good as the permiscouous teenager (Election) who tells her brother that these people have no life in them and that they should wake up.Brilliant overlooked film.Rating 9.5 out of 10.  Definite must see.",Pleasantville
96,macpherr,It can be analyzed multi dimensionally.,9,16 August 2000,"This movie reminded very much of  ""The Truman's Show"" where everything is perfect but there is no freedom of choice.  Every day is nothing but repetitiveness, acting, memorized scripts but nothing spontaneous. No insight into good and evil. I thought the idea of adding color to the scene every time a character had an insight or became aware of what was good and evil was brilliant. The movie is clever! Fun! It can be analyzed multi dimensionally. One of the most important issues raised in the movie to me is that; for there to be freedom to choose there has to be the ability to think. When one individual thinks, the community can be shaken, so said Aldous Huxley in ""Brave New World."" If one cannot think there would be any difference between such  people and an animal. However, sometimes I wonder about my dog, he is so clever and insightful that I wonder if he really does not think up to a certain level. Somehow he let's me know what he wants, how he feels, and even if he was naughty, I can tell by his face and ""doggie body language."" Whether this is behavioral or not, I don't know with certainty. The ability to think as given to mankind by God is intriguing as it leads us to things like the woman in the movie giving an apple to her boyfriend to eat and the apple turning red.  This can be traced to the Bible story of Adam and Eve. Then there come the consequences. Colors!!!!!  When they have, knowledge colors will show. I love that!   There is not a good word  in the English language for that - but there a Greek ""rhema"" which means that is reality to me: now!  It is the wow moment!  I recommend the movie, I found it to be clever, cute, this is a  great movie. Favorite Scenes: The red apple; the make up in shades of grey (who would ever think of such a clever thing!).  Grey makeup, that is funny!  Could it be a grey area? Just think! Favorite Quotes:  David/Bud Parker:"" They're happy like this."" Jennifer/Mary Sue Parker: ""No, David. Nobody's happy in a poodle skirt and a sweater set.""  This quote makes one wonder if mankind could be happy outside the imperfect world we live in.  It seems that the movie implies that a perfect world is possible only with freedom of choice - that is one of the most beautiful gift given to men. Just think about it!",Pleasantville

The next moment a mysterious old man appears at their door asking if they have a problem and solve the problem offering a new remote. With the help of this new remote the two will get to be part of the David favorite show and his sister Jennifer wants to go out of there sooner. So she makes some unusual things for these natives who have not even heard of fire and triggers a series of events that will eventually animate each inhabitant and the city. In this world of their own in black and white, a rose starts to catch color then a chewing gum, a dish, a jukebox, a car to the first person and slowly the whole city. Mayor does not agree with these changes but he ends up being the same and has nothing to do but to comply the situation. It is a unique film that has it all. A touch of science fiction, romance, drama, comedy and fantasy. In the eyes of every film fan must see this as a masterpiece you need to have in the collection.",Pleasantville

99,SMLA11,Very creative movie,9,31 May 2002,"This movie is a brilliantly, creative movie.  I thought the most imaginative part of the movie is the changing from black & white to color with a bunch of imaginative ideas to do that.  Reese Witherspoon and Tobey Maguire give very delightful performances and so do William H. Macy and Joan Allen.  The art part is very good and the Shawshank Redemption rain scene was cool.Overall the whole movie is creative and the acting is superb.  Rating 10 out of 10.",Pleasantville

Flower pretty. Book pretty.I am reminded of the tag line: Do You Get It?I am appalled at the lack of ingenuity this movie shows. Despite the black/white/color hook - which gets tired very fast - this is a by-the-book hit piece for things that were very safe to hit. There is no cleverness in the script anywhere - nothing that sparks and makes you think. It hides behind the very (tired) images and dialogue that it wants to take down, and then it presents them as new a different. I am appalled that this movie pretends to be deep social commentary when it's just trying to spoon-feed the viewer recycled material with a hook worthy of an ""I'm dreaming"" episode of a TV sitcom. It's like a salesman who steals your doormat and then tries to sell it to you because he knows it's something you would buy.Were the actors any good? It's hard to say because the script calls for them to act like they're two-dimensional characters all the way through the movie - this includes all the colorizations and modernizations. On that score, they did perfectly well.Leave this one on the shelf and watch Edward Scissorhands for a much better fairy tale with better sets, better direction, and a better script.",Pleasantville
101,gitrich,A movie like no other film ever made. You will thoroughly enjoy it!,8,22 November 1998,"Pleasantville, written and directed by Gary Ross, will entertain you, make you laugh, make you think, and make you cry. How many films can do that folks? I don't know when I have seen a movie so well acted, even by the bit players. In my opinion, Toby Maguire, Reese Witherspoon,William Macy and Joan Allen should be up for Oscars next year. Jeff Daniels, Don Knotts and, the late, J.T. Walsh were outstanding in their different roles. Yes, the film is preachy at times and tends to stretch its points a bit too much, but I still strongly recommend it. As an added bonus, you will see some, no doubt, award winning cinamatography.",Pleasantville
102,Spideyfan-963-246215,Nothing Is as Simple as black and white,10,14 June 2014,"Pleasantville (1998) Starring: Tobey Maguire, Jeff Daniels, Joan Allen,William H. Macy, J.T Walsh,Reese Witherspoon,Don Knotts,Paul Walker, and Marley Shelton Written,Produced&Directed By:Gary Ross Review Nothing is as a simple as black&white Is everything pleasant in your life? Are you always happy? Or are you like me when nothing ever goes your way? If the answer to the first two questions are no and the third one yes then you should watch this film. You should know that the film references some cult black and whit television but I don't know which. But this film is going to hit with it's message and it lasts. That hope is still in the world even if you change. In Pleasantville David is young man in high school who watches TV times Pleasantville and has watched every single episode and is going to watch the marathon while answering the questions. And he has a crush on a girl in school but doesn't have the courage to ask her out. His sister on the other hand is a fad girl who hangs out with her friends and is trying to make a date with the hottest guy in school. But everything changes when a TV repairman comes at their door and gives them a new remote. He starts asking David questions about Pleasantville, when the repairman leaves David and his sister start arguing over the TV again and they pull the remote and it sends them to Pleasantville, where they begin to discover something in themselves and the town. You will appreciate this film more if you do what I did and go in to it knowing very little. It will be the greatest joy you will have with this film. You might like it if your a self-effacing person because nothing ever goes your way,if you just want a good laugh or if you just want to smile after a bad day.Because it has some memorable characters played by wonderful actors. Tobey Maguire plays David who once he goes into the world of Pleasantville must become Bud and sticks with that name because he is changing. He gives an amazing performance, Tobey Maguire notably does when he plays characters similar to these. This is the best performance I've seen from Reese Witherspoon who plays David/Bud's sister Jenifer/Mary Sue, Her character's always spice things up to her taste, it makes Maguire's characters eventually play along in his own way. Joan Allen(who's work I've never seen)plays Betty the mother of the television characters Bud and Mary Sue. Her and Reese Witherspoon share one of my favorite sequences in the film. Marly Shelton plays Margaret who gives cookies to one of the characters from the TV world but decides to go with the change that she's happening around her. They all feel something in their guts these characters and that's the best thing about them they don't know what to do, they would usually feel scared of getting out of their comfort zone but they have the courage to do so. The film has great cinematography, it's the best looking even when it's in black and white. Plesantville is one of the best films you will ever see,it looks beautiful,has memorable characters with knock out performances. It's well shot too, Plesantville is a pleasant 10 out of 10.",Pleasantville
103,Mr_Censored,"In a word, pleasant.",8,29 July 2009,"Tobey Maguire and Reese Witherspoon play feuding siblings in the 90's who are forced into living inside of a 50's sitcom in ""Pleasantville,"" a surprisingly moving and satirical film from Gary Ross, the writer of such feel-good fare as ""Big"" and ""Dave."" While the film nails the tone one would expect from the writer turned director, what ""Pleasantville"" has in store for its viewers is – for lack of a better term – a ""pleasant"" mix of satire and sentiment as well.If you're not sold by the unique narrative or the gorgeous cinematography at hand, then look forward to the film's brilliant cast. Sure, a young Maguire and Witherspoon are engaging enough, and you can't beat William H. Macy and Joan Allen as the TV parents, but it is Jeff Daniels as a short-order cook turned artist who steals the show. His role in the film and the way he executes it captures both the humanity and humor of the film and ultimately goes a long way to make ""Pleasantville"" the unique experience it is and is definitely one of the most criminally overlooked performances in an often over-looked film.While the movie doesn't exactly encapsulate the turn of the century quite in the way that it sets out too, it does bear a few lessons that you're never too old to learn. The main message of the film is to live life to the fullest, to not be afraid to take risks and not be afraid to fail and make mistakes. For every good experience, there's a bad experience to counteract it, something that the folks of the fictional town don't come to realize until the two teens arrive on the scene. To that end, the film is a success, and in essence, ""Pleasantville"" is timeless.",Pleasantville
104,d_m_s,Pleasantville,1,29 April 2014,"Couldn't even finish this one.It was like an over-long and not very good episode of Eerie Indiana or The Twilight Zone.The idea was daft really, a random magical electrician guy turns up to repair a remote control and instead leaves a 'special' one behind, that looks like a toy that some kids would make rather than a remote control, and ends up transporting a fighting brother and sister into the fictional world of Pleasantville - a TV program.Had this story been part of one of the shows I mentioned above it might have been decent as it would have been shorter and more focused, but as a feature film it was really padded out, even in the 45 minutes or so that I watched. I just couldn't keep it on any longer.The amount of suspension of disbelief that is required for this film is beyond reasonable - not because 2 'real life' people get transported into a TV show, but because of what happens once they are there. In particular, Toby Maguire's character, who continuously insists they must act ""normal"" so as not to upset the fictional Pleasantville world is nonsensical. They is no explanation of why he feels they have to fit in rather than go crazy at the absurdness of the situation. And the idea that the fictional world carries on and people live their lives once the show is off air is more implausibility, especially since they do not lead normally lives but seemingly repeat whatever their character does while the show is on air, ad infinitum.Not a lot of sense to it and not very engaging. A weak idea that feels padded out. Could have been an interesting episode of a 30-minute TV show but no more.",Pleasantville
105,BadWebDiver,Intelligently entertaining,8,18 March 2002,"This is a movie that's both creatively entertaining, with interesting social commentary behind it - and played with a satirical punch.My fav scenes are the before and after versions of the basketball practice. The opening gag concerning the quadrangle is also very effective cinematic humour.  I also think the original application of the prejudice against ""colored"" folk is very fresh and provocative - without being racially biased.This was the first time I noticed Tobey Maguire, and I think he played the lead with both affection and intelligence.  It's also good to see classic comic actor Don Knotts show up again, as well as the final performance of the late great character actor J T Walsh.This is slightly reminiscent of an earlier movie STAY TUNED, only with more social bite.  It's a real shame this didn't do so well in initial release.",Pleasantville

108,tapio_hietamaki,A reminder to keep looking at things from a new perspective,9,16 March 2013,"Pleasantville is beautifully shot. It's mostly black and white, but it has specks of color inserted into the image. The colors are textured and tasteful, they remind me of old Technicolor films (which are referenced in this film!) Interestingly, the guy who's behind Pleasantville also brought as Hunger Games, though these movies are hardly comparable.Pleasantville is a charming film which shows us how an utterly conservative, closed universe goes through some major changes. As always, there are those who can't stand change and do everything in their power to stop it -- parallels are drawn to fascism and racial segregation. The force that overcomes the stiff conservatism is, largely, human goodness and art. The film has a lot to do with classic literature and paintings.So it's more than an adventure about teens getting stuck in another dimension, but it's that, too. Pleasantville has good character development, romance and conflict and trouble of all sorts, but it doesn't get too dark. It's got a great sense of humor. While at times it gets almost too clever for it's own good, it still has a light heart and a great emotional impact.",Pleasantville
109,thefan-2,This movie is all heart.,5,3 May 1999,"A confused little movie with a heart of gold and no brain.  The teenage son preaching the obvious at you gets tedious very fast.

110,bob_bear,Better than you might expect...not as good as it might have been,7,14 January 2006,"Technically, the film is great. I think we're all agreed upon that. Have to admit though that, when it first turned to black and white, I did feel like turning it off. Not because I don't like authentic black and white - but because I thought it was going to be the faux variety Well it was, but for a legitimate reason that becomes self-evident. I'm glad I stuck with it.It felt like the film had a lot to say but I don't think it did so articulately enough or effectively enough. It is sometimes confused. Example? Reese Witherspoon as the slutty sister who turns into a bookworm (like ""Grease"" in reverse) whilst, conversely, her ""Mother"" is liberated from the kitchen? What was that about? And Tobey Maguire's cookie-baking girlfriend? Just another damsel in distress role in the time honored tradition that remained noticeably unchallenged.Yes, the film has good intentions. It wants to say something worthwhile but somehow it fails - however, at least it tries! And, it has to be said, it is a damn sight better than Jim Carey's ""The Majestic"" - a film set in its own Pleasantville - that never manages to either challenge or entertain.",Pleasantville
111,Chromium_5,"Sloppy, weird, and insulting",4,9 October 2005,"(Note: I assume anyone who reads this has a general idea of the plot; I don't feel like giving a huge plot summary.) When I first started watching this, it seemed pretty good. The beginning was clever and funny, and I was really enjoying it... until the color began showing up. It was at that point the movie lost any sense of humor it might have had, and got increasingly garbled and pretentious.The idea of two teenagers bringing 90's values to a 50's sitcom is a good one, but director Gary Ross exposes his prejudice by making it clear he equates 50's television with 50's culture in general. As if he could be any more out of his league, he doesn't even seem to be familiar with 50's TV in the first place (what on earth is ""Pleasantville"" supposed to be a parody of, anyway? ""Leave it to Beaver"" wasn't NEARLY this bland).""Back to the Future,"" a fantastic movie with a similar premise, was about a teenager discovering his parents were really not so different than him when he was young. ""Pleasantville"" is about two teenagers discovering their parents' generation was hopelessly backward and ignorant, and it is up to them to set things right. How mean-spirited is that!? Setting things ""right"" basically involves teaching everyone how to have sex, which didn't exist in the 50's, so by the time the movie ends the town has become a giant group orgy, although thankfully pregnancy still doesn't exist. I could hardly believe this was supposed to be taken seriously. Another user put it very well saying this movie is like Adam and Eve leaving a black and white Garden of Eden, only to go straight to a color heaven (an Islamic fundamentalist heaven, apparently).Skewed values aside, the movie is even more annoying because of its unnecessarily slow pace, and a plot that keeps getting sloppier and sloppier. Of course you're going to get people who say, ""It's just a metaphor; you can't pay too much attention to detail."" Well, even a metaphor has to have some coherency. I'm referring specifically to the ending, where David goes home and Jennifer decides to stay in Pleasantville. Yes, if you haven't seen the movie and you're not sure if you read that correctly, let me say it again: Jennifer decides to stay in Pleasantville. What is David going to tell his mom?? ""Where's Jennifer, honey?"" ""Oh, she got sucked into the TV set and decided to live in a sitcom. She probably won't be back."" And like that's not weird enough, how exactly did he explain the situation to his Pleasantville mom? ""Mom, I'm not actually your son. I know you think I am, but I'm really a kid from the 1990's who got stuck in Pleasantville, and I'm going to go home now by traveling through your TV."" I think she took it remarkably well.I will say that it's worth watching for the mixture of black and white and color. I can't imagine how long it took them to edit all this. Scenes like hundreds of pink flower petals falling against a gray background are simply amazing. Visually, it's a great movie. If you watch it with the sound turned off and pretend it has no plot, I'd give it a 10/10. Otherwise, it's a 4/10 at best.",Pleasantville
112,Fudge-3,Excellent. Recommended.,8,23 March 1999,This is a very intelligent movie. The general idea of the film sounds daft but it really is good viewing.I only went to see it 'cos there's been nothing but romantic movies on lately and we were desperate for a flick fix.

113,Kirasjeri,IT SEPARATES THOSE WITH IMAGINATION FROM THE DULLARDS,10,13 August 1999,"To put it simply, it is shocking that there are ANY negative reviews for this fine film on the IMDb. It was creative and charming; an extended Twilight Zone episode where the addition of color is a metaphor merely for self-discovery and self-exploration; if some resent ""a message"", they shouldn't.  For those with imagination it is easy to appreciate.It was a crime that the politics of the Academy Awards, and the power of Miramax, helped prevent the deserved nominations for this movie, and especially Joan Allen, who I first saw and was struck by in ""Manhunter"".",Pleasantville
114,Kirasjeri,"Good, but THE FIFTIES WERE NOT EVIL NOR BAD",10,10 March 2002,"Reminiscent of an old episode of the Twilight Zone, the movie is indeed a charming fairy tale, and creatively done. I liked it a lot, and Joan Allen is wonderful. BUT. . . THE 1950's WAS NOT THE HORRID PERIOD PEOPLE ARE SUPPOSED TO ASSUME!! Only in PC Left-wing Hollywood would you see the Fifties depicted in such negative terms.The 1950's had many problems. But it also had some strengths missing from America today: patriotism (at least before 9/11); strong families; a moral center and moral values in the country; a strong respected Military; our national borders were secure instead of being wide open; better public schools; we had trusted political leaders (Eisenhower, etc) instead of dirtbags such as Clinton; and a lot less sleaze out of the ""Entertainment"" industry on TV and the movies. Among other things.So, much of the point of ""Pleasantville"" is lost in a morass of PC baloney. It is TOO BAD we DON'T now have families such as that in ""Father Knows Best"" or ""Leave it to Beaver"" instead of the misfits and weirdos on TV. And if they kept sex in the bedroom where it belongs, instead of anytime and anywhere, such as with shows like ""Sex in the City"" all the better.Excellent film - but with a very flawed and false message.",Pleasantville
115,jacksisjax,Somewhere between a 7 and 8,7,24 August 2020,"This movie is no doubt- VERY strange. Don't you dare try to dissect the HOW of this movie, because there is nothing there.
It doesn't make sense.
But that's not the point.
Pleasantville is just the medium in which the writer wanted to display this entourage of symbolism. The story isn't particularly amazing but it is art. It's racked with all sorts of cultural, religious, social symbolism. It's kind of a treat, as I watched this through the lens of religious proportions I had a wicked good time.If you are just wanting to kick back and relax this movie probably isn't the show to watch, it won't satisfy in that realm. This movie is just something else and I kind of rather liked it.",Pleasantville
116,AscendeSuperius,Amazing underlying themes,8,8 September 2021,"Wow. This was much better than I expected. While I can talk about the great acting, music, or even just the chemistry of the actors, I'll instead focus on the plot. The plot, on the surface may seem like just another sci fi film, but what really brings it to another tier is the underlying themes behind some of the things that occur in the film. Oppression, revolution, even to go so far as to have book burnings like the Nazis really made this film shine. The classic 'power of emotions esque trope' is simply the cherry on top. While I'd say is that although this is probably not the most family friendly film, these topics covered are ones that can be the catalyst for a really long and good talk with a friend, family, or perhaps even just another stranger who watched this film as well.Lastly, though comedy is not a main theme, I just wanted to say that there is one tiny little joke in the film that is just absolute gold. Like that Calvin Kline joke in Back to the Future good. So if you're not yet convinced if this is the film for you, I'll just leave you with this: you may like it, or you may not. But in the end, it sure as hell made my day and maybe it might yours too.",Pleasantville
117,Camoo,A perfect metaphor for spiritual enlightenment,10,21 April 2007,"I'm not sure if this movie translated the same way to other people.. On the surface it is a light comedy, perhaps a satire on modern families and values. But wow, did it his me on such a deep level. One by one, the people of this black and white town begin to burst spontaneously into color, or 'wake up.' Even the scene where Joan Allen climaxes in a bathtub to a tree lighting ablaze outside was so meaningful on so many levels, the orgasm, the water, the fire... And it left me with a very positive feeling about life and these kinds of awakenings that can and do happen very literally to certain people. Those people will understand this film more clearly... Spectacular dream like imagery, but very 'user friendly' in a sense that it is universally understandable, but also very surreal...",Pleasantville
118,AZINDN,Romanticized Nostalgia: Shaking Up the Status Quo.,9,27 February 2006,"Nostalgia for teenager Bud (Toby McGuire) is the idealized representation of Americana in a ""Leave It To Beaver"" style of television that was 1958 USA, until he and his sister, Jennifer (Reese Witherspoon) are mysteriously transported into the television storyline by a metaphysical t.v. repairman (Don Knotts). In Pleasantville, everything is black and white, a disturbing setting of seeming perfection with the notion of non-whites absent from the setting. Pleasantville is a haven of the myth of all-white, suburban post-war neighborhoods reflected in colonial 2 story houses with gleaming white picket fences but surrounded with gray roses. Bud's TV parents (Joan Allen and William H. Macy) live without problems, concern, need, and sex. The Pleasantville high school basketball team always makes every basket, they always win even without a Kobe or MJ, and the girl's poodle skirt sweater sets and flip hairdos are the convention for every giggling teenage virgin. Enter Reese Witherspoon in 1950 torpedo bra and saddle shoes, headed for lover's lane she initiates the basketball captain (Paul Walker) with flaming colorful results.The perfection of an unchanging society and existence is not Camelot however. Nothing is amiss for Pleasantville until color begins to seep into their reality. Color becomes a means of deviance and normality with implications that arose with the changing social conventions of modern art, abstraction, and the contentions that were brought to the forefront by the Amory Show in the United States in 1913. Through color, the world is enriched and forever changed. Eve's apple is red, so are her lips, and it is obvious to everyone that a new awareness has come into their everyday existence. Color denotes emotion, sexuality, and change for Pleasantville's population.The nostalgia surrounding Bud's perfect t.v. world begins to crumble as color blooms. Perceived with trepidation and reluctance by townsfolk, the growing awareness of difference and changes expressed with the subtle insertion of color becomes a tool the film maker injects. Its first emergence is beautiful but as the color theme spreads becomes a tool for a McCarthy like prejudice and witch hunt. As residents slowly come to see in-color, the difference between the status quo and those ""colored"" individuals divides and sorts out who is and is not appropriate in the disintegrating paradise. ""Happiness is ignorance"" according to the demonic TV repairman, but the citizens of Pleasantville are further torn by their inability to stop the rapidly unavoidable changes.This is subtle storytelling done with the cinematographer's eye toward how powerful the change created by uses of color to connote difference. With sexual, social, and cultural implications towards difference vividly presented, expectations for thought and acceptance is immediate. Questionable characters and behavior is not an overt message in Pleasantville. As the society breaks down and becomes more McCarthy-like through gang witch hunts and public denunciations against difference, the neighbors turn, suspect, and torment. Ultimately the perfect society is on the verge of fascism as government tries to impose conformist rules a la Nazi restrictions against Jewish communities of WW-II, later the 1950s HUAC hearings, and the 1960s anti-Vietnam activities. Prejudice is perhaps a too simplistic notion in Pleasantville, but the story is told in an altogether solid and entertaining message that deserves attention and is more than time well spent.",Pleasantville
119,rms125a,Too saccharine by far,5,4 March 2003,"This unduly acclaimed film was way too saccharine for me. It's a heavy-handed allegory on conformity and censorship, either set in the 1950s or trying to evoke the 1950s.Basically pedantry, manipulation and treacle unleavened and unalleviated by real humor or conviction (much like the politically correct speeches at today's Oscar, Emmy, Grammy and Tony award telecasts). William H. Macy was OK but Reese Witherspoon and especially Toby Maguire become way too saintly by far, for my taste anyway.",Pleasantville
120,clydestuff,Pure Film Bliss,10,14 March 2004,"If memory serves me correctly, the first time I was about to see Pleasantville I had it fixed in my mind that I would see a fantasy comedy romp that was nothing more than what happened to two teenagers caught in a nineteen fifties black and white television program.  The idea was intriguing enough that I thought the possibilities for comedy and slapstick were endless.  If Pleasantville had been one of those comedy capers churned out by the Disney Studios, I'm sure that is the kind of film I would have seen.  Thanks to direction and writing by Gary Ross, what I got instead was not only film magic of the highest order, but a film with so much more to say, and a film that affected me in ways I never thought possible. Pleasantville is easily one of the most gratifying film experiences I was privileged to enjoy in the 1990's.Much of the early parts of Pleasantville are as I suspected they would be. When brother and sister David(Tobey Maguire) and Jennifer(Reese Witherspoon) are sucked into an old black and white sitcom named Pleasantville, courtesy of a TV repairman(Don Knotts), early hilarity ensues as they cope with their situation.  It seems in Pleasantville, everything always has been and always will be ""Pleasant"".  The people of Pleasantville existence remains constant from day to day, never changing, never experiencing sadness, hurt, or anger. It is a land of Stepford people in a sense, not because the citizens of Pleasantville are robotic, but because they only know the pleasures and joy of the world in which they live.  At first, Bud implores his sister to go along with the program and not to upset the apple cart.  He tells her it could wreck the whole universe of Pleasantville and ruin any chance of them returning to the real world they left behind.  An easy task for the nerdish David(now Bud), who has dealt with the trials and tribulations of the real world by losing himself in the fantasy of the reruns of Pleasantville. Alas, Jennifer(now Mary Sue), is just the opposite.  In the real world, she is a sluttish boy crazy, cigarette smoking teenager, and the world of Pleasantville is as foreign to her as the clothes she is now forced to wear. Obviously her resolve to go along with David doesn't last very long.  It is then that, slowly Pleasantville changes from a farce, into a meaningful film experience.As David and Jennifer interact with the people of Pleasantville, the world around them slowly begins to change.  As their classmates and the townspeople learn and experiences things they never dream of, the things around them change from the drabness of black and white to color.  It can be something as small and subtle as a rose blossom or as they find new meaningful changes in their lives some of the inhabitants themselves change from black and white to color.  It is not long before the town is divided into two factions: those that have experienced the joys of discovering there is more to life than the every day blandness of living in Pleasantville, and those that wish for Pleasantville to stay exactly as it always has been, never changing, never evolving, forever to remain in the suspended animation of a 50's TV sitcom idea.  There are so many great performances so many well written scenes, so much wonderful cinematography as John Lindley expertly blends together scenes of color and black and white, aided by the most purposeful use of digital effects ever seen in a film.  I could list each acting performance individually be it Maguire or Witherspoon, William H. Macy, or Joan Allan, or Jeff Daniels, but they are all exceptional and there is not enough superlatives to do so.  Add to this a beautifully rendered score by Randy Newman, and you have film perfection.I have viewed Pleasantville a number of times.  With each viewing it holds more fascination for me as I discover little gems one will miss from just having seen it once.  It is one of those films I never tire of watching and for me to run down a list of the wonderful moments encapsulated withing Pleasantville would do nothing more but to spoil those discoveries for yourself.  Much has been written about what Gary Ross may or may not have been trying to say with his film.  For me, Pleasantville says that life is ever changing.  As much as we would like for things always to remain constant, change cannot and will not be held back, nor should it be feared. More importantly, especially in the times in which we live now, where people are quickly denigrated for opinions and thoughts beyond that of the masses, one should be able to express new ideas and different opinions without fear, without malice, and without contempt.My Grade: A+",Pleasantville
121,blazesnakes9,I didn't know just how surprised I was while watching this movie,10,2 March 2014,"In the 1950's, television made its breakthrough in American households. Such 1950's television shows like Father Knows Best and Leave It to Beaver hit the airwaves and create a generation of its own kind. But as time went on, television soon began to experiment on controversial social subject matter. Television shows like All in the Family, The Jeffersons and St. Elsewhere told American families and households about certain social issues such as rape, AIDS, the Vietnam War, racism and even sexual oppression. However, there was one television show that was clearly flipped upside-down. That show was called ""Pleasantville"".Pleasantville is a film that I was very surprised by because of its ideology toward different time values. In the 1990's, modest, but shy high-school student David (Tobey Maguire) is a fan of the fictional 1950's TV Sitcom, ""Pleasantville"". His sister, Jennifer (Reese Witherspoon), is not a fan of the show and would rather watch a concert on MTV instead. One night, David is hinted that a ""Pleasantville"" marathon is coming on in 20 minutes. But, Jennifer wants to watch the concert that she was waiting for on MTV. In the middle of the scuffle, the TV remote control breaks. An strange and old TV repairman, (Don Knotts) stops by and gives David a very awkward, but very special TV remote control. After the TV repair leaves, the fighting continues and as the fighting goes on, the TV remote control transports both David and Jennifer into ""Pleasantville"" itself. Instead of being Jennifer and David, they are both children of ""Pleasantville"" parents George (William H. Macy) and Betty (Joan Allen). At first, the siblings decide to play along as the ""Pleasantville"" children, Bud and Mary Sue. In the dear old town of Pleasantville, everything is calm. Everything is utopia. But, that's about to change. Soon enough, the world of this peaceful town starts to change for the better. First, Jennifer goes on a date with Skip (Paul Walker) and then goes on to make love to him. That, of course, is the introduction to sex in ""Pleasantville"". In another scenario, Bud introduces books to the teens of the town and in another scene, Mr. Johnson (Jeff Daniels), starts to paint provocative paintings, especially one particular painting involving a nude painting of Betty. After social issues starts to take its toll on Pleasantville, the entire town and citizens starts to turn into Technicolor. The community is split up between people who are black and white and those that are Technicolor. The mayor of Pleasantville, (J.T. Walsh, in his final film role), decides to create a Plesantville code of conduct that somewhat mirrors the Civil Rights movement of the 1960's. It seems that the reason why everyone is turning colors is because of emotions. With that being said, Plesantville doesn't have to be pleasant after all.The movie was directed by Gary Ross, who also worked on previous movies like Big and Dave. This is particularly his best work since the two. The interesting ideas that surrounds this movie is the difference in time values between the 1950's and the 1990's. The movie dares us to ask ourselves, ""What is our values toward different time eras?"". It is a big contrast, yes, but it makes total sense on what certain things have to be like in a community like Plesantville. Back then, Mom always had a freshly cooked meatloaf sitting at the dinner table and Dad always coming to a nice clean house. In this time of age, that's not even presentable. Things have changed over the years in our American social history. And, as we progress toward the future, our values would increasingly differ from our earlier years.One thing that also stuck out to me is the way the movie pays a great deal of contribution to American television. I was around during 1998, which is the year this movie came out. The only thing is that I was just a baby. But, I can tell that in this world, the only things that people are attracted to are the media and the technology advantages that makes this world so much different that that from the 50's. Another film that have used this kind of ideology is Peter Weir's film, The Truman Show, which was released the same year as Pleasantville. I think that these two films really tells us how far we come from a world of both entertainment values and social values.The movie is very well photographed by John Lindley and it creates a Technicolor world of imagination and fantasy. The special effects are marvelous and it works mostly because it blends with the storyline, telling us how this peaceful town get turned into a understandable environment. Even as upcoming movie stars, Tobey Magiure and Reese Witherspoon bring out the charm and humor of their characters and make them into the heroes of Pleasantville. They are smart enough to make this town into understanding their own values toward life and society. Even with that being said, the movie create a sense of unpredictability.Plesantville is a funny, smart and charming fantasy that creates a world full of imagination and wonder. Its look and photography paints a elaborate storyline that moves a certain pace with humor. At first, I didn't know if I like this movie because I have heard of it before. Well, I like it a lot and I do think it's one of the best films of 1998. ★★★★ 4 stars.",Pleasantville
122,Don-102,Touching Fluff That Gets A Bit Too Serious For Its Own Good...,7,27 March 1999,"Gary Ross has done a nice job with PLEASANTVILLE, a fantasy picture that touches on the differences between morals and family matters then and now. A ""Leave It To Beaver"" clone, constantly watched by the hero, played by Tobey Maguire, represents an innocence and perfection he just can't find in his broken world.   His divorced Mom argues in the kitchen and Tobey turns the volume of ""Pleasantville"" up.  A Nickelodeon type marathon of the show is starting and the 2 kids (the sister played by an adorable Reese Witherspoon) argue over the remote control.  You figure out what happens next.The first portions of the film are very engaging, especially the absurdity with which the Witherspoon character sees this new black and white world. Slowly, she realizes there is a lot she can do to spice things up, like along the sexual vein.  The predictable world of the 50's sitcom, where the people know only what is possible on the show (similar to Woody Allen's PURPLE ROSE OF CAIRO), generates laughs.  No one misses a basket, breakfast is always served, dinner on the able at 6, separate beds, and no knowledge of sex whatsoever.  We see the funny differences between reality and innocent fiction (even the books are blank inside) and people begin to turn to color after certain character traits are satisfied.  This is all hunky dory and sometimes wondrous to watch.  The weight Ross' screenplay takes on during the final third of the film is too heavy for the lightness of the previous acts.  I thought of Ray Bradbury's FAHRENHEIT 451 during one obvious scene and felt they should have left it a light-hearted charmer.You certainly must remember this is a film you must watch with an open imagination and a will not to ask questions.  There are many great things about the movie.  The black and white mixed with color is striking in appearance and the art direction and photography are absolutely beautiful. Some good performances, especially from Witherspoon and Joan Allen, are fitting.  Ross makes it all too serious when things start to turn ""racial"". People with ""color"" in the pleasant black and white town are segregated and one question must be asked.  If the people in the town knew nothing about sex or anything else worldly, how do they know to turn aggressive and even violent when things start to change?  I know, disbelief must be suspended, but this was such a promising movie that lost its legs from the weight of the overblown message.  This is well-worth seeing, however.RATING: 7 of 10",Pleasantville
123,CihanVercan,The Colors of Modern Life seems Brighter than ever before,10,11 October 2009,"Three movies of the late '90s -The Truman Show, EdTv and Pleasantville- specifically examined how television made an impact on our world, our culture and our values. They both showed larger than life happenings and captured our minds with their perspectives. In EdTv there was a humble video store clerk guy having his life filmed for a reality show, which was happening in present time. Though in Truman Show very futurist and fantastically, Truman Burbank was not even aware that his life is being filmed, offering the viewer the vision of life from God's perspective. Distinctively here in Pleasantville, there is a journey which starts with materializing a TV-series into life and ends up with materializing the life into this TV-series.The cheerful 1950s' TV sit-com Pleasantville is revived in the '90s on cable. A homebody teen, David Wagner, escapes from the daily rush of the real unpleasant world by watching this show. He doesn't even miss the reruns, memorizes the scripts and speaks them out before the actors in the show say their part. One day after school, he and his sister Jennifer can't agree on the right TV channel to watch. Then they fight over the remote control and it breaks. The new remote, which will zap them inside Pleasantville, given them by a strange TV-repairman.When they entered Pleasantville, they become the part of the show and turn to black-and-white as the TV show displays. David and Jennifer take up residence as the son and the daughter of the sit-com family. Soon, they realize that there the life is always pleasant; the temperature is always lukewarm and the seasons are always spring with no rain no snow no hot no cold weather, books have no words, roads end where they start, nothing burns and matches are useless, married couples sleep in twin beds, sex does not exist, nobody gets sick, nobody gets hurt and nobody ever questions this hassle-free life. David fits right in as he always dreamt to be, while her sister persists on him to try to figure out what should they do to escape from there. Though she changes her mind when he gets a boyfriend from school. Her attempts of putting her lifestyle on effect causes Pleasantville gets colors. Thus wonderful and frightening changes start to take place.Pleasantville is a truly original film that soars with dynamism and aesthetic. From a social and deeply political perspective; it has deep meaning and relevance in today's society. Consequently, it should serve as a reminder for most that the world is made up of how its residents think and act. ""You can't stop something that's inside you."" says David, and that could be summation of all that Pleasantville stands for.",Pleasantville
124,heyimmyx,Immy's review : A beautiful spectacle,8,1 December 2020,"Pleasantville is a wonderful movie about the beauty of human nature. I loved the quirky nature of the film, taking place in a 1950s dystopian TV show where everything is 'perfect' and nothing is ever unpleasant. It carried good performances all round, and had a good balance between light hearted humour and a philosophical touch. There were some very moving and heartwarming moments, and overall the film retained a touching sentimental feel throughout that never failed to leave a smile on your face. The soundtrack was phenomenal, and some scenes were absolutely breathtaking to look at. The court scene ending was slightly cheesy, but overall this was a lovely little gem of a movie. Highly recommend!",Pleasantville
125,nakrugt,The Pink Umbrella,10,29 December 2020,"I remember first reading about the film about its revolutionary visual effects. After watching it in 2005 (I think, or maybe 2007 for the first time), though, it was clear that it was much more than that.If you watch it today, you may think it was a direct reference to today's US internal political and social climate. Especially, if you start watching it somehow having skipped the opening scenes in colour. Even the wording used by the conservative characters in the film can still resonate with the current right wing movements in the USA.The references, though, are not just limited to '50s US. You can find references to:
The Nazi movement of Germany,
The systematic racism and sexism in the USA (even existant today),
Generation gap and its outcomes in modern society,
The acceptance of the different (or ""the other""),
Alienation and suppression of the individual identity under the established institutions,
Reluctance and resistance against progressive change,
Acceptance of yourself as an individual,
Pains of coming of age,
Discovery of sexual identity,
Struggle to fit in within the borders of pre-determined social and gender roles,All of which are still related to contemporary societies and lives of the individuals everywhere on Earth.All wrapped up within and behind the metaphor of color.All hidden in plain sight.All bravely exhibited in a black and white world, under the pink umbrella.",Pleasantville
126,Ron Plasma,Not everything in black & white makes sense.,3,30 March 1999,"The trailers for Pleasantville were compulsive.  This was going to be big hit material - clever cinematics, nineties know-how trashing fifties schmelz, but old-fashioned feel good triumphing in the end.Well, yes and no.  Initial reviews in the UK were lukewarm, certainly not scathing, but two weeks after opening and in the aftermath of the what's'it awards, I had to travel outside the megascreen temples, where life is suddenly beautiful and Shakespeare is in omnipresent love, in order to find a screening.  It really wasn't worth it.  The visual jokes - you know, single beds, perfect sports players, milk everywhere - made me smile, as no doubt thirty minutes of the TV series would have done, but the dark undertones of book burning and racial segregation didn't sit well.  And as for Joan Allen's sexual awakening in the bath!  The Bergman school of comedy all of a sudden?Luckily I had recorded Coronation Street to come home to.  Back to reality.",Pleasantville
127,Captain Ed,"Pretty good movie, surprising, a little heavy-handed",6,13 June 2000,"When I first heard about this movie, it sounded pretty silly to me -- two teenagers are transported from the 90's to the make-believe world of a 50's television show.  Since it was marketed as a comedy at first, it didn't sound all that appealing.When I caught it on cable later, I was pleasantly (no pun intended) surprised.  Tobey Maguire was especially good in the lead role, and Reese Witherspoon delivered the best performance I've ever seen from her, although that's not saying a lot.  Joan Allen and William Macy are great as the 50's parents who have it all together on the surface but are terribly conflicted internally.However, this film suffers from two things: terminal cuteness and a 50's phobia that is so cliched it's tiresome.  The theme of the movie shifts abruptly from a standard science-fiction premise (Maguire cautions his sister not to do anything that will destroy Pleasantville's reality or they may never get back home) to a simplistic screed on racism and stifling conventionality.  Not that there's anything wrong with fighting racism, but maybe it would have been better to introduce the theme a little earlier, when the two were in the 90's.  (Yes, it DOES exist in the 90's and 00's too.)As far as the stifling convention goes, Hollywood seems to consider the 50's the Decade From Hell and takes every opportunity to let us know that.  This is the effect that the Baby Boomers have had on the entertainment industry; they feel they rescued America from the 50's by giving us the 60's and 70's. That's fine, they're entitled to their opinion, but if I have to see one more movie based on that thought I think I'm going to puke.  Get over it -- the 50's are forty years gone already.Other than that (my soapbox commentary!) the film is really pretty good and worth watching.  Don Knotts is hilarious in a small but important role.7 out of 10",Pleasantville
128,ray-280,"""Those are **Whitey's** cookies, Bud. They belong to him!""",10,3 October 2006,"How good? This good:CASTING: Let's see, we get future A-lister Tobey Macguire (David/Bud), future Oscar winner Reese Witherspoon (Jennifer/Mary Sue), three-time Oscar nominee Joan Allen (Betty), Oscar nominee William H. Macy (George Parker), and for good measure, Emmy-winner Don Knotts (ex-Barney Fife, ex-Mr. Furley, Serlingesque TV Repairman). Not since The Breakfast Club has such an impressive cast of relative unknowns with great futures and veterans been assembled.CINEMATOGRAPHY: Brilliant and deserving of its many awards. You FEEL like you're smack in the middle of a 1950s sitcom, in a way that goes beyond any specific set design.WRITING: The writers seemed inspired by many sources, including Rod Serling (Twilight Zone), Gary Larson (Far Side comic strip), and the movies Back to the Future and Last Action Hero for time-travel and injection of real people into the fiction they love. This movie surpasses each of these insprirations in their areas of strength.PLOT: The plot is the most open to interpretation, as many read their views of the 1950s into it. The metaphors are deliberately obvious, as the movie touches on issues of civil rights and the general conformism of the era, but the bullseye in its sights seems to be the Hayes Commission, the Hollywood industry group which set the standards for fiction during that time. This film SCREAMS ""Hayes"" in its presentation of Pleasantville, a town where the weather is always good, everyone is happy and productive (and Lily white), the music is elevator and not disliked enough by anyone to be banned, and life is predictable.Thanks to Don Knotts' repairman character, the boring David and the slutty Jennifer (who seems to have an unwritten, unspoken crush on the boring David that is hinted at just enough to avoid controversy) are transported into the world of Pleasantville, a soap opera set in middle America in 1958. The time travel is a necessary plot device over which neither the movie nor the characters obsess over, beyond David wanting ""the remote"" back from Knotts so he can get ""back to the present."" Since they are in fiction, the space-time continuum is not in constant peril as it was in Back to the Future, and this enables the characters to mess with the past in ways that movie could not.One plot device central to the movie involves the characters changing from black and white into color as they evolve spiritually. For some, sex accomplishes this, but not for others like Mary Sue, because sex was nothing new for her (or for a surprisingly large number of Pleasantville residents). This device enables the film to address the serious issues of racism and civil rights in the context of people not liking what is different. In one scene suggesting gang rape, Betty is surrounded by young thugs because of the color not of her skin, but her dress, but the behavior is identical to that dark side of racism and rape. The courtroom scenes were designed to reflect the many legal battles endured during that era.Despite the political overtones, the movie focuses more on individuals than society. Society will do what it will do, but each resident of Pleasantville reacts to ""coloreds"" and their own coloring, in their own way. They realize that a lot of the world has been hidden from them, and become either scared or obsessively curious about what lurks behind the world's curtain. No one is BAD in Pleasantville, but uber-conformism has suppressed everyone's true nature, leaving them as black-and-white shells of their ""colorful"" selves, and it is up to all of the characters, including David and Jennifer, to push their own boundaries in order to become whole and spiritually fulfilled.Whether or not you agree with the message or the film, it was an incredible achievement for any filmmaker to be able to blend so many complexities into a single film without boring the viewer or going all over the map.Let's not forget the microcosmic, triple-entendred line from the repairman, commenting on the ""colored"" Bud accepting cookies from Whitey's girlfriend: ""Those are WHITEY's COOKIES, Bud! They belong to him!"" Easily the best picture of 1998.",Pleasantville
129,duraflex,The 50s weren't really that way and the 90s weren't that great,1,13 November 2005,"The movie is technically clever, well-acted and beautifully photographed - but that's where the good stuff ends.The point of view of this film is that people in the 1950s were stupid, complacent, unaware and uncaring of the world outside their immediate environs. Not so. Furthermore, the film would have the viewer believe that if one drops all sexual inhibitions, whether you're a teenager or a middle aged wife and mother - only then will you be fulfilled. Again, not so. That's how we got the real life screw-ups that show up with Jerry Springer, Maury and Montel on TV every day of the week.To put this film in a historical context, the 50s were really a breathing space for America after saving the world from the Nazis and the Japanese in World War II just a few years before. In the 1950s, the United States was heavily involved in rebuilding those parts of the world devastated by a war they did not start.Before that, Americans had struggled through 12 years of severe economic hardship known as The Great Depression (effectively 1929-1941).In the 1950s, middle America was getting back on its financial feet and raising families. There was peace and the beginning of prosperity for the first time in many years. The U.S. was not filled with innocent, stupid teenagers. High school graduation rates were far higher then than now. The economy was good and unemployment was low. The polio vaccine was developed and cures for other ailments were in the works. Rock and Roll had its beginnings and the space exploration program was started. Civil rights changes were also emerging. For most people it was a very good time. Fast forward 40 years and look at today's crime stats, divorce rates, incurable STDs and high percentage of unwed mothers and consider whether or not the more moralistic 1950s were not a better time. Too many young people look like idiots with their tattoos and piercings and dressing like bums or whores. When did ripped, over-sized jeans falling off your backside become a positive fashion statement? More importantly today, consumption and greed are rampant. The U.S. has lost millions of manufacturing jobs and the borders are wide open driving down wages. It used to be a coveted privilege to emigrate here - now it's a catch and release program at best and English is becoming an optional language. Standards in everything are eroding.Look at the family sitcoms of the late 1990s like Rosanne, Malcolm in the Middle vs. Leave It To Beaver of the late 50s early 60s and consider where you would rather be.Pleasantville is a movie with little understanding and appreciation of the period in American history that it attempts to belittle by its revisionist portrayal.This film is not funny, witty nor insightful. I'm not sure what it was supposed to be.",Pleasantville
130,pied,The Truman Show it's Not!,4,18 July 1999,"This is a film which mixes its metaphors.  When ""Bud"" is transposed back into a 1950 Leave it to Beaver like scenario, things are perfect, everyone knows their place, and life is predictable.  I couldn't figure out whether having adultery, wilder music, necking on ""lover's lane"" were supposed to be good innovations or bad, and I don't think the movie could figure it out either.  There is a scene where ""Bud""s Pleasantville girlfriend offers  him an apple (Adam and Eve in the garden) which suggests that temptation and evil have come to Pleasantville  in the form of new  and dangerous ideas. The film couldn't make up its mind whether all the changes were good or bad. Just changing from black and white to color doesn't do it.I'd rate it  a 6.",Pleasantville
131,kupcr,All Is Black And White.,7,13 June 2020,"This movie was still fresh back in the day when Don Knotts was still alive and Toby Maguire had not yet been Spiderman. There was a story about a brother named David and a sister named Jennifer who suddenly ZAPPED into this small town of 'Pleasantville' and how these two people of 'colour' interacted and changed the entire environment and it only took an emotional act, outburst or situation to change all that. I really thought I'd enjoy this movie again, but I couldn't really get into it, although the filming locations were nice with old classic cars, Toby's acting is always still plastic and hollow. He shows no real emotion whatsoever in any of his roles, even if he is considered talented with his wide googly eyes and a funny smile, but Reese Witherspoon who was only 22 when this film was released, was only 14 when she appeared in her first film 'Man In the Moon'. she is still going strong at 44 with her current new series doing well and she doesn't tire! Reese pushes herself to the limit. In 'Pleasantville', she becomes her character and gives it her all and her interaction with Joan Allen's Betty character and William H. Macy were all good too and they work well together on screen. I liked the ending with the Fiona Apple cover of a Beatles song playing in the background.",Pleasantville
132,the-gossip-king,"Great, creative movie!",7,17 April 2008,"I really enjoyed this movie. It is one of those movies that you always enjoy making fun of but you really enjoy. There are so many deliberate mistakes in this movie that it makes me love the movie all the more. The movie follows teenagers in modern day who are transported back into a fifties television show called 'Pleasantville.' What is Pleasantville? Well it is you typical perfectly pleasant fifties soap show. When they et transported back there they begin teaching everyone about whats cool and having sex. Tobey Maguire was great as the nerd who knew everything about the show and Reese Witherspoon was terrific as the rebel who teaches everyone about sex down at 'lover's lane.' Soon when everything begins to change from black and white to color they find themselves really enjoying being in Pleasantville. The story is terrific, my only problem is the ending which is probably the biggest joke of the movie. It felt as if the director had no idea where to stop so he just decided to suddenly stop there. Besides that, a really good movie.",Pleasantville
133,thniels,A better tribute to Twilight Zone,8,27 November 2002,"As has been commented before this movie shows clear influences of The Twilight Zone. Not spooks or thrills but elegant strangeness just as Rod Serling would have shown it. Whether it be intentional or not, this is in my opinion a much finer tribute to Twilight Zone than Twilight Zone, The Movie was. Subtle and optimistic. Even the black and white parts had that television black and white flawed contrast of those days. Wonderful.",Pleasantville
134,Gambitt,"Warm, feel-good movie that descends into the dreaded C-word",6,4 March 2003,"Pleasantville starts out nicely with a good premise, but its plot gradually devolves into cliche themes that we've seen countless times.  By the end, it had completely lost my interest, and I wasn't entirely paying attention.It's a shame because it starts out fairly well.  What better comparison than the utopian view of society in the 50s versus the problem-plagued issues of today?  But as I watched, I couldn't help but feel that there was so much more the makers could have done to explore the world of Pleasantville and contrast it with David's and Jennifer's view of life.  So much untapped potential.  It was cute how there were no toilets and how the bball team couldn't miss; I think the movie could have delved a little deeper into other Pville quirks.Plus, I KNEW I shouldn't have let my mind wander, but I did... I began to see more and more holes and unexplained, fuzzy elements.  So is whether or not someone ""gains"" color more dependent on the person himself or the beholders of that person?  The movie would suggest  the subject himself, but then again, how do inanimate objects then gain color?  If these citizens were so incapable of doing anything outside of the norm or outside of the script, then how could they function at any level once David and Jennifer began to affect Pville?  For example, how could they conduct a court trial if nothing had ever gone wrong before in Pleasantville?  Wouldn't the entire town plummet into chaos very soon?  All these questions detracted from the movie for me.  I know I shouldn't have been so critical at a fantasy movie, but then again, the whole movie is about asking questions, right?In the end, Pleasantville is just another movie about challenging norms.  A hero(s) enters a new environment, starts to make some noise, opens peoples' eyes, causes a repressive counterstrike by the ruling conservatives, but then ultimately triumphs.  Hey, that's exactly what happened in Footloose! Throw in some odd, out-of-place, almost inappropriate references to racism and you've got your typical ""what makes America"" movie.But this does touch on an aspect that DOES set this movie apart; because they do not state exactly where Pleasantville is located, the entire story happens in a political vacuum.  Is it in America at least?  Presumably, but then again, the residents of Pleasantville seem to be unaware of ANYTHING outside of town.  This has an odd effect on many of the themes in the movie.  For example, the whole issue of the paintings and the rock music are no longer issues of freedom of speech, since there is no Bill of Rights in this town.  In a way, the issues are more basic and fundamental than typical ""what america is all about"" movies.  So all in all, I was a little disappointed, but I still give it a 6/10.",Pleasantville
135,EmptyLeo,5 out of 10,5,26 September 1999,"I just couldn't get past the terrible acting by this Tobey Maguire. He looked like someone just saying their lines. I probably could have done better. The rest of the acting was good and I liked the premise but it seemed this movie didn't have an ending to me. Nothing was really resolved. Really liked Witherspoon (go watch Freeway) Daniels, Walsh and Allen. Don Knotts was cool too. I'll watch this again, maybe concentrate a bit more, but for now - 5 out of 10",Pleasantville
136,LilyDaleLady,"Weak, overpraised, simplistic",2,5 September 2005,"I am giving this a 2, simply for enjoyable performances by some of our best actors -- Bill Macy, Joan Allen, J.T. Walsh (one of his last roles). Otherwise this film is a cheap shot at what I guess the director seems to think was bland 1950s conformism. ""Pleasantville"" is not the only film recently to make this kind of simplistic social critique -- think about ""Mona Lisa Smile"" or ""Far From Heaven"". It's awfully easy to take potshots at a target as easy (and old) as 1950s culture, and it's interesting that these films are pitched at an audience which is far to young to actually remember the fifties, even if they were just barely old enough to have been born then.What is ""Pleasantville"", really? It has elements of an episode of ""Twilight Zone"" (some things, like the town you cannot escape because all roads lead back to it, are direct lifts)crossed with ""Leave it to Beaver"" and ""Father Knows Best"", among others. I'm old enough to recall when these shows were actually ON television, and I can assure you that nobody at the time actually believed these were solidly realistic depictions of actual day-to-day life -- they were SITCOMS, for God's sake. They were meant to be amusing and funny. They were also aimed at families with children, and shown early in the evening, which is why they don't deal openly with sex. (Unlike much of modern programming, which is so pandering and graphic -- even early in the day -- that it would have been considered pornography 25 years ago.) If you actually WATCH shows from the 50s like ""Beaver"" and ""Father Knows Best"", instead of just clips or what you THINK you remember, these were actually not bad, and not as bland as ""Pleasantville"" wishes to remember them. Especially ""Beaver"", which I have seen in recent re-runs, was a well-written family show and the characters were far from being depicted as being perfect (in fact, they often were shown as flawed, and in need of learning life lessons).I find it hard to believe that anyone really takes sitcoms to heart (then or now), and actually believes that they depict a realistic slice of life, and then bases their real-life decisions and activities on this! (If Gary Ross does or did, then he needs a shrink, not a job directing movies.) So when contemporary films reach out to expose the emptiness and lies of old sitcoms, they are basically being cowardly --because the real job of art (whether books, movies, etc.) is to shine a light at YOUR OWN CULTURE AND TIMES and criticize THAT. But to do that would take courage and vision,and that is sadly lacking in our current crop of directors and movie studios.I'd also like to add how very very tired I am of movies that basically exist to show off expertise and set design in terms of CGI (computer graphic imaging). The conceit of ""Pleasantville"" is the contrast between B&W and color images, something that was already being done heavily in TV commercials even in the mid-90s. It's a cool effect, but stretched over the length of a film, it quickly becomes a tiresome gimmick. CGI does not substitute for good writing, witty dialog or the clever conclusion to a story.Need I add that the real 1950s (like EVERY time in the existence of the universe) occurred in color? That color movies were very common by 1950? That color photography existed in abundance? That B&W was only used where it was more economical, but that everyone was quite aware of the existence of color film, movies, printing, etc.? Or that everyone everywhere since time began has had sex, and that it was not invented in the 1960s?",Pleasantville
137,darkjosh,"Marvelous, Touching Movie Magic",9,1 September 2000,"Where does one begin to describe the brilliance and magic in this wonderful piece of cinema?SPOILERSPleasantville's smart, moving, and enticing script deals with two 90's kids (Maguire and Witherspoon, both splendid in their roles) who get sucked into a generic, feel-good, black-and-white 1950's sitcom.  As they bring their own brand of beliefs and values into their new world and others become curious, take notice, and ultimately change their routines, and begin showing their true colors, quite literally.  The result is simply one of the most emotionally touching movies ever filmed.The entire cast is in top-form here.  William H. Macy does an effective job of playing the father-knows-best, and Joan Allen simply shines in her portrayal of his wife, whom is at first ashamed of her new-found, unexpected radiance, but finally realizes it is much more worthwhile than her former predictable dullness.   Jeff Daniels is deeply touching as the soda jerk turned artist.  Paul Walker as Witherspoon's timid beau is himself very cute and plays the role with a enjoyably goofy hilt.
Wherever a shred of color is present in an otherwise back-and-white setting, emotional depth is invoked by it. Some terrific, smart, heart-felt and magical scenes include all the basketball players making and missing their shots, non-consecutively; Jeff Daniels being proud of the fact he closed the diner down without Maguire's help; Maguire helping mom Allen apply grey makeup to her colored-face, and both William H. Macy's and Maguire's realization-induced colorization.Pleasantville reminds us what a great film is all about: originality, intelligence, and beautiful story-telling.

138,fred-houpt,"Oh, that's so swell",10,27 March 2007,"There are films we lovingly refer to as ""feel good"". You all know them and have your own list. I heard this of this film and read a review and thought it looked like fun. Just watched it last night and I was totally delighted. First of all, it is my own personal rule that any film that has a soundtrack by master Randy Newman is already a hit in my house. Newman's soundtrack, it has been argued, are the laces and connectors that hold this film together. While it is true to say this, it can be misconstrued as a weakness of the film; to say, for example that the film would have suffered without Newman's always deft touch is misleading - it has enough depth and strength to stand on it's own. Of course these type of movies work well with lots of music and while not all is Newman's, when his work is called for, he brings all his talents into view. In this film, as in so many other films, he is firing on all cylinders. Think of his great soundtrack work: Awakenings (a personal favorite), Toy Story, Ragtime, and so many others. Sometimes a great soundtrack is non-obtrusive, like a soft background glow that we sense quite subconsciously. Other times it's really in your face and that sometimes works. This film has all kinds of period piece music which most viewers will know. Newman's additions finish and complete all the musical color you could ask for. The actors as many reviewers have stated are all superb, with Joan Allen a particularly strong presence. What lends this film to that feel good place in our hearts is the obvious charm of the fable. Only a mind made of stone would not see the parables, the metaphors and moralizing. The script is written to be open and yet with enough complication to make us stick around to see how it all winds up. While it is easy to say that it's a film about how love conquers all, it is more. This film also functions as a mirror and several times in the film a mirror is used to reveal the changes in the coloration of the person. The motif is fitting and again if you're not too dim you can see that the mirror is held up for all of us to look into. This is not a deep film nor is it philosophy for dummies. In the best tradition of classical Greek comedy, we locate our identifications with ease and recognize our own shortcomings. Rarely does a movie present this concept without falling into a morass of preaching and sermonizing. With everyone in the mythical town devoted to making things in life nice, it alone keeps the center, as it expands into awareness and discovery from exploding into chaos and anarchy. If in our own child like state we realize how black and white our own minds are, the alternative (as we gain color and gravitas, as we loose our innocence) to....""Fighting in the streets"" as an outlet....is this movie. (The one overtly violent moment when the men rioted after seeing the naked painting is subsequently handled with calmness. The coloreds are encouraged to just clean up; retaliation is not an option they have grasped and it is wisely not introduced by David or Jennifer. How fitting it was to hear the fabulous John Lennon tune ""Across the Universe"" close the film. While he wrote that ""...nothing's gonna change my world""...we know that this was not true of his life or his philosophy. Lennon strove his whole life to change, to evolve and to shake others up. Maybe the director is saying the same of anyone who claims that nothing is going to change them. It is not possible to be alive and not be affected by change. This film is not a panegyric to revolution; it is the softer awakening of self awareness that can, if people choose, to move with love. This is a really terrific film and everyone shines. Superb.",Pleasantville
139,Deckard-16,"A rare comedy that is deep, complex and maybe a bit too ambitious for its own good.",10,1 November 1998,"It is no surprise that Gary Ross --the writer of BIG and Dave-- once again brings a very smart comedy to the big screen, but what is surprising is the level of directorial stewardship that he brings to a very complex undertaking. PLEASANTVILLE is a wonderful laugh-out-loud satire that deals with issues such as racism, fascism, artistic freedom, individuality, sexual mores, 90's amorality, group control and some other things I probably missed. But Ross wraps his messages in ambiguity and, most importantly, entertainment. Any movie that uses Don Knotts effectively has really got its wits about it. The performances from every single actor --including extras-- are Kubrickian in their perfection and often hilarious. Tobey Maguire, Reese Witherspoon and Joan Allen are standouts in this standout cast. Maguire is very good at showing the thought processes going on inside his head behind his eyes. Witherspoon's vixen is devious without being mean. And Allen, like she did in FACE/OFF, brings a heart and soul that is key to the amazing things going on around her and to her. This movie tops THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT MARY on the laugh meter and furthermore the way Allen's scene in the bathtub pays off is as outrageous as ...MARY's hair gel scene. The first hour of this movie is as funny as anything I've ever seen. I haven't even mentioned the ""look"" of this film yet. It is fantastic. The seamless blend of color and black-and-white ceases to become an issue very early on. You accept this parallel universe for what it is and that is the highest compliment you can pay to the effects crew. Fortunately Ross doesn't miss any opportunity to use it for laughs and social comment. Some people have criticized the movie for waffling on the themes it speaks to, but I feel that any ambiguity that Ross built into the script was simply meant to avoid any preaching and let the audience make up its own mind about what the movie means. My only real criticism of PLEASANTVILLE is that it may be a bit too ambitious for its own good, but I'd much rather have a movie that tries too hard than too little. Next to SAVING PRIVATE RYAN this is my favorite film this year so far.",Pleasantville
140,Wilbur-10,"Dull, preachy, patronising ....... and boring.",4,16 August 2002,"I had no great expectations for 'Pleasantville' but felt sure it would be a solid effort, with a lot to quietly appreciate. Initially everything seemed fine - the premise was good, the performances above-average and I settled back for some low-key but worthwhile entertainment.The story involves a brother and sister who become transported into a 1950's black & white sitcom. Here they are able to influence the limited TV-existence of the people and literally bring some colour into their lives.It's difficult to know what precisely sinks this ship - but I really found it an ordeal to sit through. Firstly 'Pleasantville' is at least 30 minutes too long, the narrative becoming patronising and preachy with scenes added just to force points home. The film tries to convince itself and the audience that it has a profound statement to make, which it clearly doesn't. It certainly has some poignant social comments but as Dirty Harry would say, you have got to know your limitations. By wanting to convert the world, 'Pleasantville' turns into a rampaging, out-of-control, maniac. I felt I'd been subjected to a Cold War brainwashing session by the end of the film - never have I watched the credits move up the screen with such relief.",Pleasantville
141,writerasfilmcritic,"""Pleasantville"" Reminds Me of the Town We Live in Today",8,25 November 2009,"If you think ""Pleasantville"" is only about America in the fifties, think again. The abject conformity, the unquestioning belief in conservative propaganda, the appalling ignorance, the complete lack of sophistication, and the simmering bigotry bubbling beneath the surface ready to boil over at a moment's notice -- that more or less describes the town in the movie and it's precisely what our town is like, as well. In fact, the flick gave me the willies just watching it a second time because we are surrounded by people just like that. Our next door neighbors, for example, are straight out of some Nazi nightmare, ready to ""dial 911"" for the slightest reason. The woman (hardly a lady) spies on us openly and brazenly as if there is nothing wrong with it. Today I watched in bemused horror as she directed a fire truck toward a single car accident that occurred about a block up the street. There was nothing wrong with trying to help, mind you, although they already knew full well where they were going. It was the way she pointed in the direction of the accident dramatically and repeatedly as if she were some sort of self-appointed cop trying to earn her merit badge and her assistance was ever so important. What a butt-kisser and what a Nazi. You had to be there to see it with your own two eyes to understand precisely what I mean. The broad is simply nuts, and in this neighborhood, she's hardly alone. Others call in complaints over really trivial matters that don't concern them in the least. This particularly egregious clique that lives in our immediate vicinity are always chatting one another up like a gaggle of teenagers yet they refuse even to acknowledge our presence. It's not that we want to socialize with them, because we don't, but there is something so strange and weird about those people that it's difficult to describe in a few choice sentences if you don't already understand. Bible-thumping conservatives act as if places like this constitute some sort of real world paradise. What a sorry joke. It's a complete police state and about as far from paradise as one can get. Not to excuse or justify the lefties, we used to live in one of their so-called paradises and it was a complete hellhole, too.",Pleasantville
142,JesNollie,A different and engaging film,8,25 June 2001,"This film stars two of my favorite young actors, Reese Witherspoon and Tobey McGuire as brother and sister that are transported into a 50's sitcom that the brother is obsessed with.  Both are great in this film, but I especially enjoyed McGuire.

143,Putzberger,Halfway Home,6,21 August 2010,"""Pleasantville"" as about a pair of modern teenagers who are transported into a black-and-white 50s TV show. That scenario has disaster potential of FEMA proportions, so when the filmmakers avoided making a post-modern film version of ""Gilligan's Island"" starring Will Ferrell is half the battle. And director Gary Ross got just about everything else about ""Pleasantville"" half-right, which makes for a halfway decent viewing experience, nowhere near as bad as it could be, but not as good either.The look of the scenes in the sitcom small-town is half-right -- the costumes, hairstyles and set decorations are perfect, but the pretty black-and-white cinematography and odd camera angles are more reminiscent of an art movie by Scorcese or Woody Allen than grainy single-set 50s TV. The casting is half-right. Don Knotts as the mysterious TV repairman who transforms people into sitcom characters? Perfect. Tobey Maguire as the nerdy, unpopular teen obsessed with an old family sitcom? Way too easy. Looking at Tobey Maguire back in 1998, you assumed he was a geek, so he coasts on his charisma deficit and doesn't bother creating much of a character. Reese Witherspoon as the slutty girl who introduces sexual liberation into the staid 1950s? Brilliant. This was before anyone knew how good she was, and her depth and intelligence shine through this gimmicky role -- her sense of mischief in her early sitcom scene is hilarious, her transformation into a more thoughtful young woman is quite moving. Jeff Daniels as the soda jerk with artistic aspirations? Confused. Is his character stupid or repressed? Daniels never figures it out so he plays it both ways and winds up just kind of stiff and awkward. Finally, the politics of ""Pleasantville"" are halfway thought-provoking. A few scenes of book burning and threatened gang rape are enough to make you wonder if ""Pleasantville"" is about the sentimental impulse at the heart of fascism. But that's kind of intense for an American movie so it almost literally backs away from that idea in a bizarre edit and becomes a sentimental movie about self-acceptance and self-actualization. Which is fine, just not incredibly distinctive. Good but not great.",Pleasantville

Two teenagers from modern society are sucked into the black-and-white world of a 1950s American sitcom where life is just peachy, literally.  That's the basic premise of this movie and it makes for great viewing.  It's the sort of movie that gives you a lot of stuff to think about and it was kind of refreshing in that way.  The use of color and black-and-white was quite powerful and very symbolic.  The actors in general did a pretty decent job, and I think I'm becoming quite the fan of Reese Witherspoon!Definitely worth a rent, or if it's on TV, be sure to catch it.",Pleasantville

In the show, they are the son and daughter of the characters played by William H. Macy and Joan Allen. Of course, when you have someone from another time, there's bound to be some changes. And they are. Pleasantville's youth starts experimenting with sex, rock n' roll, and books.

The cast is great, the music perfect, the dialogue witty, the acting fab. I was mesmorised. It works on different levels & is open to interpretation. I think it's about the transformation of film from b&w to fabulous colour. It's also about freedom, change, personal growth, racism, family values, rain, relationships.

147,kellyadmirer,"Thought-Provoking and Clever, but Tremendously Misunderstood",8,2 October 2006,"I really like ""Pleasantville,"" though it runs off track a bit towards the end, with unnecessary violence and confrontations. I like it on its terms, though, not the terms that everybody seems to impute to it. In short, it is the story of two 1990's ""average"" teens (one an obsessive fan of a 1950s family drama about an ideal town in the mold of ""Father Knows Best"") who are transported magically from their own shabby world to the world of that TV show.OK, let me get out a couple of thoughts up front. ""Pleasantville"" is not an attack on the Fifties. It does not contain any references to Nazis (though there is some unnecessary fascist imagery). It is not a polemic about the Civil Rights movement. Sorry, I know that's what everyone wants to believe. But it isn't so.The use of a 1950s-style TV show to develop the plot is what throws everybody off about this film. It may as well be a movie about the 1850s as it is about the 1950s, but the film happens to be set in 1950s suburbia, so immediately everybody's opinions about that milieu rise to the surface. But that is a red herring. The actual point of the film is much more interesting.The film is not saying that the 1990s (or whenever) is better than the 1950s. It is saying that real life, with all its messy situations and complications, is preferable to some perfect fantasy-land. It also is saying that obsessing over an old, completed body of work - here, the old TV show - is a dead end. It is static and unchanging. That story is written and will never change. But real life isn't already written, and is vibrant and infinitely preferable. Not realizing that is missing out on what life has to offer.So, if you are a big fan of, say, Charles Dickens (to get back to that 1850s comment I made above), that is all well and good. But his novels aren't going to change. The endings are whatever he wrote, and he's dead. His works can be enjoyed, but they are no substitute for real life adventures, which don't have endings yet.Note the beginning of film, when the Tobey Maguire character sits through lectures about the horrible things happening in his world. That's the key - the film is not trying to say his world is more perfect or anything like that. He is such a big fan because his own world (broken home) is so horrible, and he longs for a touch of ""Pleasantville"" perfection. But his world is his reality, and finally he realizes that that is way better than any fiction.The best scene in the film, for me, is at the very end. The Don Knotts character, when all is said and done and the Maguire character has learned his lesson, gives a knowing smile and drives away. I like to think that he knew the movie could just as easily have been called ""Mayberry.""",Pleasantville

I can't imagine more wrong choices as far as a script; if this was meant to be a family picture, why so many references to teen sexual activity as casual and liberating?  In the real world where I live, people have to live with consequences (pregnancies, sexually transmitted diseases, guilt from exploitation, etc.).  The sister who tampers with the Black/White/Grayness of the world and helps it to ""Fall"" as in a Genesis ""eating of the APPLE"" kind of way doesn't even come back to the real world after finding that she can project some D.H. Lawrence novel that she's never even read somehow. I also don't appreciate being lumped together and ""dumped on"" in behalf somebody's biased view of the somewhat restrained/censored Fifties.  Suburbs, conformity, and repressive ""whiteness"" are too-easy targets that got lampooned much better elsewhere in Peter Weir's THE TRUMAN SHOW.  Steer away from this people-exploitation film that has some odd performances (the best is given by Don Knotts) in favor of some better ""small town"" screenplays with an actual ""heart"" like CHOCOLAT (2000) that was set in an imaginative realm with diverse people to really care about!",Pleasantville

Despite being an awful film, ""Pleasantville,"" does provide us with interesting generational viewpoints.  Notice who gets shelled in this film, the '50's and the '90's. Conveniently sandwiched between these two highlighted decades is the real culprit.  Growing up in the '60's, being educated in the '70's, and working in the '80's, the hippy generation has once again stuck it to their forbears and their offspring.As the story goes, the people of the 1950's were so square they couldn't see color because they lacked sexual knowledge and experience.  Moreover, people of the '90's lost the vigor of color because the sexual revolution had long ended with just assembly line sex remaining.  If a rational individual removes the one linchpin of this logic (e.g. sex), the whole proof crashes down upon itself.  All I'm convinced of, is that the hippies, were, are, and continue to be consumed by the issue of sex, and anyone not so inclined is square.  This movie rates two out of ten.",Pleasantville

Further does it suggest that those that believe that society needs some kind of order via rules are the problem?

Once there they began to influence the characters by destroying their innocence and changing their values.The picture starts out as a comedy or parody, if you will, of all of those B & W sitcoms like, Father Knows Best, The Donna Reed Show etc. As the story progresses and the characters begin to change, the mood of the film changes from B & W innocence to the realities of the nineties complete with sex, violence and protests.All of the cliches of the old sitcoms are there, from the twin beds, to no toilets in the washrooms, to the ""golly gee"" ""swell"" innocence of the characters in Pleasantville. I thought that the comedy element of the 90s teenagers thrust into the Pleasantville environment could have been played out a little more.Maguire and Witherspoon are good as the teenagers but it is veterans Jeff Daniels, Joan Allen, William A.

Although occasionally crossing the border to semi-schmaltzy, ""Pleasantville"" is not afraid to tell us that amid all the terrors of modern life - ozone depletion, unemployment, and AIDS are mentioned in the beginning, and the independent and divorced mother's struggle to find herself and a few others opens and closes the film - we still have to believe that our values are right.

155,great_sphinx_42,A Rainbow of Delights,9,16 March 2001,"How interesting it is that the statistical rating for 'Pleasantville' plummets nearly an entire point between people under 18 years of age and people aged 45+. 'Pleasantville' is a lot like an actual teenager- bright, amusing, rebellious and possessed of a fierce and passionate sense of personal freedom. This is not a subtle film, but it has a lovely, misunderstood message, cool Crayola effects and nice performances. The point here is not strictly that the 90s and color are better than the 50s and black and white. The point is that black and white can still exist in a world of color, but color can not exist in a world of black and white. The point is not that the 50s were evil, but that the backwards-thinking idealization of that time brings with it the cultural sterilization that flourished then. The 50s were the 50s and they were as they were supposed to be- there's nothing particularly wrong with that. People have responded strongly to this film because the 50s are falsely seen as some sort of promised time for America and there are those who find that image appealing. That was a time when these people think that ""their morals"" ruled supreme, and Manon forbid that ""their morals"" be attacked as they attack ""ours"". It also takes people of the 90s to task a bit- as Jeff Daniels' soda jerk notes, we don't even realize how lucky we are. 'Pleasantville' is not saying, as has been alleged, that sex equals free expression. The basketball team captain doesn't spring to color after Jennifer deflowers him. He stays in black and white and tries to make her burn her book. Sex is one of many tools used by this bright, passionate movie to metaphor- and *embrace*- the Fall. Sex doesn't make one 'colorful'. Self-awareness and free-thinking do. The idea is that self-awareness and freedom of thought are good things. That's it. Of course, the human being is not a perfect animal, and with self-awareness and freedom of thought come a higher saturation of some things that are problematic- witless promiscuity and drugs. But promiscuity and drugs existed in the 50s, along with racial and sexual hatred, violence, and thoughtlessness. All of these are not reflections on a lack of cultural moralizing- they are reflections on a lack of widespread personal responsibility. They are also not products of the 90s- they are products of the state of being human. But do we really want to give up self-awareness and freedom of thought to live in the 50s again, just so we can cover up all the problems we have now and HAD THEN AS WELL with hypocritical and constricting 'black and white' moralizing? That is the question 'Pleasantville' asks. There is a saying that anyone who gives up freedom for safety deserves neither. This is the message 'Pleasantville delivers.

Gary Ross, who wrote the screenplay for Big, has written and directed one of the more interesting films of the year. Some critics have mistaken it for a movie about the 50's. It is really about social norms, the social order, and the various forms of reality that we construct.The basic premise is simple enough. A brother and sister arguing over a remote control encounter the equivalent of a mass media black hole and wind up in an old 50's sitcom that looks suspiciously like Leave it to Beaver. They discover that they are, in fact, in Pleasantville--the 50's town where all couples have twin beds, nobody on the basketball team misses a shot, and geography lessons are limited to Main Street and Elm Street since there is no existence beyond Pleasantville. As our 90's teens try to adapt to life in Pleasantville, they discover that their awareness of life beyond has the potential to disrupt the social order. Because Pleasantville is a TV town from the fifties everyone in the town is in black and white. But as the presence of the siblings begins to change things in Pleasantville, patches of color begin to show, and other disruptions occur. The malt shop owner discovers his interest in art, people begin to change their routines, and the basketball team begins to miss shots occasionally. But the entire social order falls apart when the TV father of the siblings (wonderfully played by William H. Macy) comes through the door, and announces ""honey, I'm home."" But this time his wife is not there with martini and dinner waiting.As the changes begin to accelerate, some of the residents of Pleasantville change from black and white to living Technicolor, so that the town is divided between people of color and the rest. Signs that declare ""no coloreds"" begin to appear in the windows, and the town is clearly divided and threatened with total breakdown of the social order.Some critics have taken this as a poke at the mythical 50's, but I don't think that this is really the point of the film. The fifties did bring us McCarthyism and homogenous suburbs that were largely a result of white flight from urban areas. But the 1950's and the 1990's are just metaphors for larger forces in all societies everywhere. When our need to maintain the illusion of stability and pleasantness leads us to squelch dissent and diversity we end up living a lie. That is the primary theme of Pleasantville. The next century promises to bring even more challenges in terms of culture wars and increasing religious, ethnic, and cultural diversity. In this context, Pleasantville is definitely worth a look. This is a story worth telling and a story well told.",Pleasantville
158,HollisWoods,Beautiful Visuals & Deep Philosophy,8,22 February 2021,"The premise of this film was very unique and interesting for its time as I don't think it was done too much before this. The idea of anyone being transported form reality to a fictional world can sometimes be more desired and a welcome outcome, especially if this fictional world is more ""pleasant"" than reality. The beginning of the movie establishes the world's flaws through David's classes in school, so it's easy for David to prefer the simplicity and happiness that draws him to the Pleasantville show.Pleasantville takes it a step further by challenging the idea of whether this pleasant world is worth it. The world begins to change and evolve, for better and for worse. This lead to many philosophical questions in the second half of the film.When the film was purely black and white, the film did a good job of creating a beautiful grayscale sequence, and that's thanks to the wonderful cinematography. Black and white is such a stylistic kind of film that is so refreshing to see in a modern world where we're so used to color. And as color began to mix with the grayscale, I was left wondering exactly how they were able to pull that off. Wonderful editing! One of my favorite moments was when David was driving to Lover's lane and you see the pink leaves contrast the rest of the grayscale world, It was stunning.While the grayscale vs color was a beautiful visual aspect to the film, Pleasantville uses the coloring to present metaphorical messages to the audience. The most obvious metaphor was that of racism. From the violence toward the ""colored"" to the segregation to that one sign that explicitly stated ""no colored allowed."" Pleasantville reflected the exact behavior seen in society to groups of people who are discriminated against in reality, especially and literally people of color.Color also represents evolution. To change color was to change completely from who you were before. For many citizens of Pleasantville, this was easy to accomplish. The sense of true or human emotion was enough to change people given how stale and regular simple life in Pleasantville was. For characters like Jennifer and David, who came from the outside world, it was a little more difficult. It wasn't strong emotion of any kind that changed their appearance, it was complete character development that brought literal color to the siblings.What's interesting about Jennifer's color change specifically is that her character development was similar to that of Pleasantville, but on the opposite side of the spectrum. Jennifer created an image of herself to fit with reality's expectation so she can succeed socially. Then she becomes open to the art of literature and begins to imagine herself being more than she thought she could be. Pleasantville lacked knowledge and arts that is available in reality and without those aspects in life, they just seemed like robots.This brings up the question to what it means to be alive. Pleasantville citizens literally ran on a programmed schedule in day to day life. They never had an independent thought or feeling, and the consequences were seen during David and Jennifer's first day in town. As the siblings bring changes, knowledge and arts are really effective to the evolution of the town. This influence really opened the citizens up to independence and freedom, and that was when they truly started to ""live.""With all the philosophy that is crammed in the 2nd half, David's character development is a key aspect of the film. At the beginning of Pleasantville, he was obsessed with the Pleasantville show because the simple, easy, and happy life was the exact opposite of what his own reality was. He had a broken family and lived in world where happiness is a struggle to achieve. When he is first transported in the show, he is desperate to continue the pleasant way of life, but then he finds joy in exposing the Pleasantville citizens to a side of life that they wouldn't have been exposed to otherwise, like that scene where David gives Mr. Johnson the art book, which was a great turning point for both characters.David doesn't change color until the climax. His entire experience was mostly a positive one, and his reasons for loving Pleasantville changed, but he still loved it there nonetheless. Then he saw bullies gang up on Betty, and for the first time he felt rage toward Pleasantville, a total contrast to his Pleasantville feelings at the beginning of the movie.I really love David's final scene with his real mom. His experience in Pleasantville changed him and it really showed in that final conversation. He realized that perfection isn't the best solution. ""There is no right house, there is no right car,"" there is no right way to live in order to achieve guaranteed happiness. And sometimes the life we envy isn't the life we want. David learned how to make the best of a bad situation and that life is the way we make it.",Pleasantville
159,sourapple,more than a pleasant movie,10,11 November 2000,"i loved it. the whole thing about being on a 50's TV show, and turning into color because of presence of emotions and such is so wonderful. this is a very original movie for me because of what it depicts of those small things.aside from that good looking Tobey Maguire, the cast was splendid. lovely even. everyone did a great job, including a Reese. watch it, and you'll feel good.",Pleasantville
160,Yonhap S,A truly pleasant movie in a way,10,9 July 1999,"The skinny: David drowns himself out watching an old 50's show Pleasantville (and knows everything about this fictional world).  He and his sister, Jennifer bickering over control of the TV set are magically transported to the show. Thoughts:  Although I have mixed feelings with some scenes, especially Mrs. Parker, I find the movie to be interesting in many ways.  Director Gary Ross uses black and white for a lot of range of mood.  It could range from the pleasant scene of families together to 30's like condition in Germany. There's also some subtle scenes to be found in this movie like:  the Pleasantville Chamber of Commerce logo looks nice but later turns out to look like a Swastika in the trial or the scene where Bud's girlfriend offers him an apple and homages to past movies like To Kill a Mockingbird. As the story goes,  it's interesting how Pleasantville is also so much like our world.  The disturbing part is that I wonder with all the things David and Jennifer introduced that Pleasantville could also be less than pleasant community.  This is especially so, when you see the ending.  Perhaps it's something to tell you that there are negative by-products of this new Pleasantville.  Also some subplots were rather rushed like Jennifer's gravitation from having fun all the time to studying. The verdict: 5 of 5 stars.  The concept (though nothing new), the art direction, the subtle elements included and interesting story makes this one good movie.",Pleasantville
161,ranblackman,A great character drama with relevant commentary that is working on so many levels.,10,9 August 2019,"I can't speak to this film excellence enough. The 50s we're seen by many as a simpler time, a calmer relaxed frame of living. At least, that is the way we would view is based on our may cheesy sitcoms we had during it. This film sort of critique that when it literally showcases bringing color to black and white and black and white ideology.We see this small ideal town get .differnces introduced. We see them explore life and it's opportunities. This leads to the actual color being brought in, the town coming to life. The commentary is never too obvious, it is uplifting, soft, sentimental when it needs to be, gives you wonder when it should. The wonder of change. Even going as far as the danger of reaction to, all the way down to allegories of racism, which the decade often ignored, really work.From that, it is also a damn generous film to look sat. The way they combine the with the black and white, creating that visual juxtaposition, is so cool to see. Also, perform as interact with it just as well as they should.In the end, what these films give is a literal look at embracing change. Not living in a bubble of security, it takes critical aim at our often reaction to such things, our conservative need, it shows how this can be a problem. Yet it never goes too far with it' .polotics. It also knows to be an uplifting character drama, one hopefully all can enjoy.",Pleasantville
162,bobbyelliott,Enjoyable movie with something to say,6,14 March 1999,"I went to see this movie because of the positive reviews on the IMDb. I wasn't disappointed. Very enjoyable movie with something important to say. While it debunks the 1950s it isn't (too) cruel in its treatment of the era. If the idea of two teenagers moralising about sex, life and everything doesn't appeal then don't worry - they do it very well. My only criticism is that it's a little slow in the middle. What's happening to Hollywood? Two movies this year (The Opposite of Sex and Pleasantville) that try to deal with complex issues (sex, hypocracy, morality) in a mature way. Wow! :-) The son and mother steal the show. There are some great moments in this movie (like the mother masturbating in the bath). BTW the 12 rating in the UK is surprising. This is an adult movie and should have been rated higher. Like good sex, this movie leaves you feeling better the morning after.",Pleasantville
163,L. Lion,overrated and not very 'illuminating',5,1 March 1999,"Pleasantville was beautifully filmed but soulless and somewhat predictable.  The movie does not take full advantage of the idea of mingling 90's people with characters from a 50's sitcom.  Tobey Maguire and Reese Witherspoon are both overrated, and Joan Allen does NOT become radiant when she switches to technicolor.  The awaited antagonism from the conservative town leaders comes about far too late and then too abruptly, and the climactic courtroom scene is not climactic.  William H. Macy is wasted.  Don Knott's character was actually annoying.  This movie disappointed me even more than the thoroughly overrated Truman Show.",Pleasantville
164,stirred_mind,A Very Good Movie.,10,20 April 2000,"The first time I watched this film, I thought 'Jesus Christ this movie sux ass' but I watched it again and I thought highly of 'Pleasantville' it is a very-well done film. I love the way they mixed the colours together - it was excellent!Pleasantville follows the story of a TV Show called, well, Pleasantville! - there is one guy called David (Tobey Maguire) in the world, who is totally obsessed with the show. And woops -way too obsessed because him and his sister, Jennifer (Reese Witherspoon) get transferred to their world and Jennifer starts causing trouble.Don't miss this great film!!My Rating : 10/10.Starring : Tobey Maguire, Reese Witherspoon, Joan Allen, William H. Macy, Jeff Daniels.Certificate : M Contains Low Level Offensive Language",Pleasantville
165,Doogie D,"Crafty, canny, and funny",8,26 October 1998,"There's some comparison going on, so for what it's worth: ""Pleasantville"" is ""The Truman Show""'s subtler, and probably also wiser, little brother.The plot: people get liberated in a quasi-spiritual way in what had been a shallow but happy little town.  An example of its savvy is this: what many people think is real liberation -- free sex -- is, in the end, shown as a shallow ""ultimate destination.""  The young sister admits to tiring of being a self-proclaimed slut, and the real-life mother realizes that one more fling is not going to fill her emptiness.  (Ironically, the Pleasantville mother leaves at the end to try a similar path; if this were her answer, she could have stayed with Jeff Daniel's character, with whom she has an earlier affair.)  The film manages this without clever moralism -- indeed, its moral center, let's remember, is a teenaged boy; well-meaning but hardly the epitome of wisdom --  and has such charm, wit, and sylistic panache that one can't help but cheer it on.  When it ends, and that cover version of ""Across the Universe"" plays, it feels that we've actually been somewhere, seen some new thing.    These days, that's saying something.Fine work by all involved -- nary a misstep -- and thanks to the wildly underrated Soderberg for helping to put the project together.",Pleasantville
166,Falcon-51,"Beautiful Black, White & Color Mixing",6,4 June 2000,"Feel good movie with great cinematography. The black & white with color mixes are beautiful. Fairly good acting by a great cast. The story is about a brother and sister that get sent literally into the brothers favorite classic TV program called ""Pleasantville."" While there they make some changes that shakes up the TV characters otherwise perfect world. A little overlong, but should keep your attention. Nothing extra or special in ""Pleasantville"" other than an original idea for a movie that works well and is pretty entertaining. Several scenes in the movie intentionally mimic famous scenes from other films.",Pleasantville

It starts out looking like a bad sci-fi movie that would be shown on the sci-fi channel late at night but then as the 2 kids start messing up Pleasantville's tiny, little world, The story echoes that of our own past and how we went through similar ideas of censorship and prohibition.

168,mcgrew,forget this tripe,2,29 August 2007,"As others have said, look back at a 1950s that never existed. Whatever is it about the 1950s that people loath, it is entirely descriptive of themselves and their relationship to their parents. They seem to be trying to buttress their own self-image by tearing down their parents. Its envy, I suppose. Having grown up believing themselves to be gods, boomers (written and directed by someone born in 1956) require not just moral neutrality for whatever they do, but being right. To make themselves right, they must make their parents wrong. Your parents, see, were uptight squares that only your own inate superiority made you capable of recognizing and overcoming. Well, here it is, in terms so black and white (literally) that even morons like your parents can see it! Put another way - if I cannot get history to back the boomers-are-god theory, I'll just rewrite it, and prove it true by making it into a movie.

Plz watch so that it can get more recognition as an amazing thought-provoking really well-done movie.,Pleasantville
170,fred3f,Overrated,3,15 October 2007,"I may have expected too much from this movie and that is why I gave it a low score. Being generous, I have to say that I thought it was pleasant, enjoyable and entertaining. What bothered me is that it was also trying to be profound and instead it was just a cliché of all the false ideas that people have of the 50's. If you were born in the 70's or later or even as early as 65, you probably think the 50's is like what you see in old Ozzy and Harriet shows. It was far from that. WWII had ended in 1945. It was a blood bath. Many people lost their lives. Women and children were left bereft of their husbands, fathers and lovers. The people that came back had a hard time adjusting to civilian life - they were not the same people who left. Crime broke out and marriages broke up, for illicit sex was rampant. It wasn't just that people were horny, they had too much evil going on in their heads that they needed some way to escape it. With Hitler, every American learned the meaning of genocide. With Stalin, our former ally, becoming a greater butcher than Hitler, people wondered if anything had really changed. The terror of the atomic bomb was strong, and the treat of Communist aggression was real and had people building shelters under the ground. What people wanted on TV was normalcy. There was enough fear, terror, death and injustice in life itself. We didn't need to see it on TV. So TV gave us a fantasy world where there were good people who had good ""clean"" fun and everything worked out. It actually helped. It gave you something to shoot for, an idea that reality can be better. Pleasentville parodies a life and an America that never existed. It is stereotype that is as bad and, in my humble opinion, as reprehensible as a watermelon eating black man. The idea that there was a black and white world that is suddenly made colorful by sex is simply a heavy-handed and overly simplistic use of symbolism. There was plenty of sex in the 50's. I know, because I was there. It was rampant and good and dirty, with no excuses or apology. People didn't need to see it on TV. Unfortunately, it seems that the modern generation thinks they invented sex, or at least good sex. Trust me they didn't, any more than it was invented in the 50's. I wonder how they think that they got here? There is something comforting in thinking an earlier age was so wrong and we are so right. Dream on. This movie is so popular, so my review will probably be hated. I'm not sure why I wrote it, even. Maybe because not everyone likes heavy-handed, stereotypical productions that pretend to be saying something. They should be warned. The movie tries to parody a overly simplistic world that never existed in an overly simplistic way. In doing so, it is its own self-parody.",Pleasantville
171,spinbunny,Good good good movie,9,23 October 1998,"Great movie, great concept (and not a rip-off of The Truman Show!) Smacks a wee bit of the racism in the South in the 50s and 60s and of Nazi-ism but doesn't dwell on the fact. Go see it: the best movie out in ages as most movies this fall have really really bit!",Pleasantville
172,steve-575,I cannot believe I wasted two hours of my life on this crap.,3,8 June 2003,"I just got done watching this movie and it was one of the worst movies I've ever seen. I saw the preview for it and it actually looked pretty good and original. So I finally decided to rent it five years after it came out and I'm been regretting that decision since.Firstly, the fact that they get transported to ""Pleasantville"" via a remote control pretty much destroyed any credibility that the movie had. Throughout the movie, it seems like they want you to take it seriously but it is almost impossible given the far fetched premise. Why didn't they just make it so that Tobey Maguire and Reese Witherspoon were originally from Pleasantville?
Secondly, I kept thinking to myself the whole movie ""Why should I care about these people? They are from a sitcom. They are not real."" I don't ever like remember watching ""The Brady Bunch"" or ""Leave It To Beaver"" and thinking ""Oh I feel sorry for these characters, I wish I could change their universe.""
Finally, nothing made any sense at all. They always ate and didn't go to the bathroom. They went to school but had no books. They never heard of sexual intercourse, yet how were they born? It made no sense when certain things changed colors.I can't believe how some people have raved about how great this movie was. Sometimes I think that if you get people to watch a blank screen for two hours, you'll get people who'll write in and say that was a cinematic masterpiece. Just because a movie is original doesn't mean it is good. ""Pleasantville"" is the classic example of that.",Pleasantville
173,Paul-103,Very Enjoyable,7,9 April 1999,"I really liked this movie.  Original plot and interesting characters (not to mention the technical aspect of the b&w/color imaging).  Thought that Tobey Maguire was very engaging as the lead role, Reese Witherspoon played ""out of place"" really really well, and Joan Allen added a very touching, understated role to the mix.  Got a little worried when it started getting a little preachy (references to the civil rights movement and even the Nazis), but they backed off before it got really out of hand.  All in all, highly recommended.",Pleasantville
174,JAM-31,Dull and pointless,1,14 February 2002,"Pleasantville is a really messy, unfocused film that has nothing to do but define its' own atmosphere for over two hours, while trying to convince us that there is a much deeper meaning behind it all.I'm no expert on shows from the fifties, and I am not a product of that era, but I have of course watched many shows from that period and I understand what the movie was going for; it was trying to show us that things aren't as picture perfect as they appeared in those shows, and that change into the modern world isn't so bad--it just makes us ""free"". Fine, that's a cute premise, maybe for one of today's sitcoms (in which it has already been done many times before), but the town of ""Pleasantville"" is such an extreme exaggeration that I never bought the fantasy world presented within it. This is something that is necessary to the viewer when it comes to films involving fantasy--we must believe in the world depicted. It didn't work for me at all. Sex was something that was never talked about on shows from the 1950's, but I'm sure Mrs. Cleaver (Yes, I mean the fictional character) knew what it was! I also think that the characters from those shows also knew that there was a world beyond their own town, that there were days when it would rain, and that the local sports teams didn't always win.Director Gary Ross seems pretty unsure of his material himself, and that is probably why the film keeps defining itself; within the last half-hour of the movie, a young boy punches another. Those watching look on in surprise and wonder. ""They've never seen violence before"" someone a few rows behind me in the theatre said. Well, duh! I thought this was clear as soon as the movie started (but I still never bought it), leaving the audience to defend the monotony of the screenplay. At one point, William H. Macy looks all over the place for his wife, looking for his dinner. ""I feel sorry for him,"" an uncomfortable audience member said.When the movie is not overdoing itself in explaining its world, it is trying to shock us with sexual humor, also in the same, tedious, overblown way--after Paul Walker is deflowered by Reese Witherspoon, the camera LINGERS on him, emphasizing his shocked and dumbfounded expression, milking it for ungenuine laughs. The film then TEDIOUSLY expands this single joke commonly throughout the movie, showing us shocking images of kinky sex acts, some I can't even mention here, for my comments won't be posted (HINT: one involves a popular number in the double digits), and when we're not seeing the acts of sex or the blown-away expressions of those who have just experienced it, we get some really ""shocking"" conversation; Reese Witherspoon has been shacking up with every guy in sight, then educates her mother on ways to ""please"" herself--Oh, MY! Another shock, provoking embarrassed and courteous laughs from the audience.The final scenes of the film dissolve into complete disorder; Don Knotts starts getting angry at the kids for their disruption of Pleasantville, and goes quite mad, but what was he expecting in the first place, and why does his demeanor change so radically from that of the first act? Other characters end their stories without solutions, not that its wrong to leave certain stories open-ended--I just feel that Ross didn't know what he wanted to do with most of his characters. The final scene ""Gee, you know you're pretty smart"" is poorly written, tacked-on, unsatisfying, and forced.I think what bothers me most about the film is that, since these banal characters are just imaginary, dull caricatures of 50's television shows, who don't even really exist, why should we care about them? At one point, Tobey Macguire's character is offered the chance to leave Pleasantville, but he turns it down--he wants to make a ""difference"" here. WHO CARES! It's just a TV show! Maybe I would have cared if I found the world of Pleasantville to be believable, but I never did.  Grade: D",Pleasantville
175,hmsgroop,Roots of Intolerance Investigated,6,14 May 2000,"Pleasantville continues the tradition laid down by such films as Groundhog Day and Zerkalo dlya Geroya. In all these films the main characters find themselves in a different world where the time-space continuum remains unchanging until the main characters and the people of the world surrounding them undergo a radical change. Though the film can be appreciated by the teenager audience as well as by the adults the film crew expertly introduced the theme of fascism and racism, which helped the film to become a serious production. The film investigates the roots of  intolerance to alien values and reveals the fact that most people are not guaranteed against turning into a savage mob when confronted with something new and unconventional. It leaves the viewer pondering over the possibility of fascist and racist ideology taking over normal ethics. That's why it stands closer to Zerkalo dlya Geroya where the main hero finds himself in his native town but in the late 40-s and even meets himself as a small boy. He has to change the stalinist mentality of his fellow citizens so that they could stop being automatons and become thinking human beings capable of opposing the regime.",Pleasantville

But I'll also say, it's a rare work of art that can make you change your mind about something, and it did this for me, not by preaching, but by one brilliant, tender, wordless scene between Tobey Maguire and Joan Allen - you'll know it when you see it.It's a rare film that, without hiding anything, can make you feel better about the modern world, and reconcile you to your own messy life.

181,Shinwa,Manipulative but entertaining,5,10 November 1998,"Pleasantville falls into one of the traps of any number of movies that try to take a contrived situation and turn it into a grand symbolic statement. That said, I found it to be an entertaining way to spend two hours of my life. Certainly, there were instances where the dialogue fell extraordinarily flat, but the movie had many impressive visual achievements that drew attention away from a shaky transition in tone and an unsatisfactory resolution. I was impressed with the cast, but the attempt to tell several stories at once left me with no real character on whom to focus. I thought the plot was a little too clever for its own good, but it was clever, and that's more than one can say for a large percentage of what's out there. Joan Allen is given the most to do, and she acquits herself admirably; Reese Witherspoon is not given enough to do, which is a shame; Tobey Maguire's character is the least fully realized (I cringed every time his character just stood wide-eyed and slack-jawed while everything happened around him, which is pretty much the entire movie), but he does a good job with what he's given. Although I found this movie entertaining, I feel like it didn't control its theme enough, and most of the pleasures in it were incidentals. The climactic trial scene works, minus any sense of actual resolution. And did I mention the tone? The last movie I saw that was this schizophrenic in tone was Carrie, which made it work in its favor more than this one does. Ultimately, I'll recommend this movie; don't expect too much and you won't be let down.",Pleasantville

In the case of the fifties, it plays fast and loose with almost every facet of that decade. I was born in 1934, graduated from High Shcool in 1952 and from college in 1956. I did a two year hitch in the U.S. Army, serving in France. I was an apprentice at one of the best regional theaters in the country. I have now been married for forty-six years and raised three sons. None of this was forced on me by society, the culture, a church or some silly symbol like Big Bob. I haven't always walked the straight and narrow but within my moral code I have no room for some of the ""freedoms"" espoused by this film. Most of the folks I knew in the fifties welcomed and embraced change almost daily. We were all very much in favor of retaining what was good in the society in which we lived. As I see cultural development over the past forty years, much that is good about individual responsibility has given way to a kind of selfish indulgence and the results have been anything but good. Yes, the McCarthy era should have been controlled sooner and civil rights came slowly, but only the people most responsible for these wrongs and who profited from them opposed those changes. This film would have us embrace sexual irresponsibility, adultery, lies, cheating, etc. as acts for the common good. Nonsense! There are some polished performances, notably Macy, but they are truly wasted on this trash. In the final analysis this is a very poor piece of film making and I can't recommend it to anyone with a grain of sense.",Pleasantville

And if you can suspend disbelief at the on-the-surface preposterous premise, there's a lot to be got out of it, not least some excellent performances, notably (but not only) the wonderful Joan Allen as a flowering mum. On the down side, some of the plot devices are a bit clunky (how the two youngsters find their way into Pleasantville, for example) and the film may pull its punches a little (on the question of racism, for example).

186,dimadick,Nostalgia can be dangerous.,8,27 October 2001,"This movie has some fine points mainly satirising how people view their own past.Does anybody realy believe the 1950's where a better and more sensitive decade?Has anybody forgotten the censhorship in every form of expression?Or the flaming liberals of the time becoming the moraly decayd of the 1960's.The 1950's were a revolutionary period for the U.S.A and nobody should forgot about but pleasant they certainly weren't.Who ever decides to praise the past,distant or near should remember the problems of this past. This movie decides to take a liberal point of view.Forget about that decision.Take a look at the mayor and actualy understand that what makes you decide is your own point of view.Those people don't start to be humans when they turned colored.See them burn books.From being just indifferent to them they decide which ones express them and destroy all the others.It is an expression of thought and feeling too.The mayor who had nothing to do turns into a leader.Those kids,who were walking around doing nothing,actualy take sides in an ideological conflict. As for those of you who complain that these movie doesn't touch issues like unprotected sex,unwanted pregnancies and drugs just think about that:They are given the freedom to choose.Some of them will surely choose badly.It makes you think about the implications of free will doesn't.Watch this movie and then start taking a refreshing look in history.It is worth it.Just don't decide if you are ""liberal"" or ""consernative"" based on this movie.",Pleasantville
187,xenazues,Everything is not pleasantville you know?,9,25 January 2017,"Well we like to think the 50's was a great time. I mean most people people weren't alive then so all they have to go off is stories post world war 2 about how the soldiers came back and housing got better, and every one moved out to the suburbs. But seriously, it wasn't like that for everyone. I'm sure you hear the stories about women who waited, and how you ""court"" a girl and how guys opened car doors for women and all kind of things. It never stops.One thing I liked about this movie mostly was reese witherspoons character. We got a short glimpse of her in Hollywood and frankly I was impressed with it. I'm not talking about that country movie she did where everybody loved her in it. Or legally blonde where it was borderline an insult to my intelligence. This was the kind of role she was meant to play. A mean sister who pretty much said what she wanted and did what she wanted (and who she wanted in this movie).We also get a glimpse of Paul walker. Probably before the fast and furious days. He plays a great part. Very shy and fits right in this movie. I can't really say enough about Toby McGuire. Before spider man he played this part to death. I mean who else would have sold the ""fire"" seen where he eventually has to yell cat better. He just gives you that vibe as a kid that you feel he knows hes smart and he has confidence to wait till people appreciate him. And he doesn't need to prove anything to anybody. Another great actor.Also another about this movie is ITS ORIGINAL. How many times do I have to say that in this year 2017 movies are not original. I've seen tons of spider mans (sorry toby), tons of batmans, and even tons of iron mans. Which all those were good. But a story about a brother and sister who get stuck in the 50's and change colors? I can barely describe this to friends without it seeming out and them trying to tell my I might need a physc evaluation if I bring it up again.One more thing about this movie, it was funny. Scene after scene after scene. How many movies had so many sexual references in it and made you laugh as well? Not many. The part about the girls tongue was color? That was extremely hilarious. And the director didn't have to get vivid with it, you either got it or you didn't. How could you not forget where the daughter talks to the mother about touching herself and then she does it and the tree catches on fire? Didn't see that coming. Every part is quite hilarious but they still have a plot and meaning.And the end of the day nothing is like it seems. Its not pleasantville. Where you live at is not that great where you can control everything around you and you are perfect. I have to show this to a lot of people now in this generation so they can get the joke when I say ""i live in pleasantville"" The movie did a great job with the characters and explaining the 50's weren't even the 50's so who are you guys fooling. Whats ironic about it is was watching a crime show the other day and the town was in pleasantville and I immediately thought of this movie.",Pleasantville

But, in today's society where nothing seems out of bounds any longer, I'm sure a lot of people will eat this Hollywood dreck up.  Do yourself a favor.  If you want uplifting entertainment or good family entertainment go see something else.  If you are after sex - go see a porno.  This was really stupid.

189,Lucky-63,Classic: looks good feels great,9,18 July 2000,"Anyone who was exposed to the 'perfect world' portrayed by American TV in the 1950s, or by Life Magazine in the 1950s, now recognizes that portrayal as a narrow caricature. The ""It isn't how you feel, it's how you look"" attitude.Ain't it great that Don Knotts, once a part of that hideous grey distortion of The Truth, was still alive to serve as the agent of change in this movie. By handing ""Bud"" a remote, he admits him bodily to the world of a TV show by which ""Bud"" is mesmerized. The result is that ""Bud"" somehow infects that make-believe world with his passion.Many movies are ""moved"" by passion; Pleasantville forces us to recognize that passion is a necessity. It has a lot more than that to say, and says it in layer upon layer.In the Wizard of Oz, color entered because the technology ripened just as the movie was being made... a happy accident. In Yellow Submarine, color was restored, to a world subdued by the Blue Meanies, by a pop music band. (Pleasantville concludes with George Harrison's ""Chi Gurudeva"" tune.)Passion comes to Pleasantville as people unlock what's inside them. A man tired of making cheeseburgers discovers a passion for art. A woman discovers she has no passion for domesticity, but for an old sweetheart.One of those movies that has more to say with each viewing, with genuine humor and genuine affection for true humanity.

What makes a sitcom? Situation of course. Anyone who has seen the typical 1950s sitcom ""I Love Lucy"" would know there are many incidents in an episode. If nothing happens in its characters' daily lives, like this film depicts, there would be no situation.

191,MadWatch,"Oh, how the world has changed. Or has it?",1,12 October 2004,"Brief recap of story: A brother and sister from the 1990s are magically transported into the world of a fictitious television show from the 1950s. There actions have consequences and result in major changes with the characters from the show.The misandric (anti-male) messages abound. As the (positive) changes occur in the town, the adult males are the ones that are shown as being adamantly opposed,and are shown as stereotypical stuck-in-the-muds that don't like change. The adult males are shown as incompetents that are unable to even cook for themselves and gripe about having no one (i.e. their wives, which they are *dependant* upon like children) cook, clean or prepare their clothing for them.The movie goes into depth to portray what the expectations of women back in the 1950s (e.g. cooking and cleaning), yet does NOTHING to portray the limitations and responsibilities imposed upon males, like providing for the family, wearing a suit and tie everyday and ""male""-oriented work like yardwork. As with most aspects of modern culture, only the lamentations of frustrated women are shown and males are shown as living in a utopian society with no worries or limits.Just as other movies, this movie shows a woman having a extra marital affair and it is ""justified"" because she has grown weary of her married life. Despite the fact that she never *discusses* the matter with her husband, who remains OBLIVIOUS to the changes that are happening, she has decided that her husband cannot cope with her newly discovered sexual desires and seeks out another man. This, of course, would be *taboo* if a man had done it; there are enough movies showing what a creep a man is who cheats on his wife, yet a when a woman has an affair it is always ""justified"". The father character is shown as being a nice guy, who never accosts his family, provides for them and seems to do nothing wrong, yet this also portrays him as being boring and therefore needs to change.The movie started with an interesting premise and had really good acting and good special effects, I just found it difficult to stomach the frequent negative attitudes about males and the male bashing. This movie would fit in well in the book, Misandry: The Teaching of Contempt for Males in Popular Culture.Overall the movie was pretty hypocritical. The basic premise was, ""People should be free to do what they want, as long as what they want is what we tell them they want."" For example, the father character was comfortable and happy with his old life. *That* was the life he wanted and he was happy with it. But this is portrayed as wrong because he is not ""changing"" his lifestyle to conform to what the other people are saying. Huh?",Pleasantville
192,Artêmis,"A brilliant idea, a marvelous movie",10,3 October 1999,"Pleasantville is one unforgettable fable about one boy, David, and his sister, Jennifer, that entered in one TV-series of the 50's where everything is happy and beautiful. There, the basketball team of the city always wins, the only work that the fireman have to do is to take cats out of trees, there isn't sex... Everything is pleasant in Pleasantville! But everything was also black and white.David should act now as Bud Parker and his sister as Mary Sue Parker. For David, a fan of this sitcom, everything was OK but for Jennifer, one popular girl, being in one place so calm was very boring. David tried to keep Jennifer doing everything as in the sitcom but she didn't want. So she started a revolution in the city. In each demonstration or discovery of a new felling, the person would get colored.As Gary Ross said, this movie is about people that can't behave, act or adapt with their own changes. ""It's about people that want to stay in black and white and people that wish the color."" It's about people that want changes and more than this, people that do something for that changes to happen and be real.The sexual theme is very explored by Gary. One of the first changes for color happens when Jennifer shows her boyfriend that there are a lot of different (and more interesting) things to do in the car than only hold her hand. Then, she shows her mother Betty (played by Joan Allen, great as ever) how to masturbate. When Betty try to practice it, the tree in the front of the house explodes and burns. This scene is very funny as the fireman had never seen one fire before and he didn't know how to  act in the situation.For me, one of the best scenes is when Joan Allen doesn't want to stay in color and asks Bud to make her up using gray lipstick, powder, you know, gray make up. But why did she want it? Because after more than 90 minutes as a comedy and romance, Pleasantville turns a choking drama. Many people (as me) that read only a few comments about it might be surprised with its end. A enormous revolution happens with blood, fights, fire, protests, stoning and discrimination against coloreds. I loved its end. In fact, I didn't like a single detail of it but even so it's not so important. How can someone dislike one so happy end with the music Across the Universe playing in the back? Well, what I know is that Pleasantville is a small masterpiece that will be forever in my mind and in my heart too.    
** I have to say that the Academy Awards had been unfair with Pleasantville. It deserved at least 6 nominations. And Joan Allen was better than all the nominated supporting actresses.",Pleasantville
193,newday98074,Terrific,8,12 April 2007,"Pleasantville preaches freedom from societal brigandage. Conformity steals that source of life that creates, disallowing us from being who we really are. Souls wither in an atmosphere where they can't be different because we are all different. Try expounding on those themes in a two hour movie that has to sell tickets and you realize how successful Pleasantville is. My favorite scene takes place in the Malt Shop where the lead character explains ""Huckleberry Finn"". ""They realized that they were already free."" A perfect explanation of mankind, in reverse. This isn't saying Pleasantville is perfect. The courtroom scene grates more than a bit, and while morals can be overdone ethics can be underdone as well. However a freed prisoner is likely to stretch his legs unless-he's still afraid. Don't get on too high a horse and you'll love this movie.",Pleasantville
194,Snatchy,A heavy-handed mess,2,7 March 1999,"Okay, I figure anyone reading this already knows the premise (or at least can surmise it from the oodles of comments already posted).  Just to throw in my $.02, this movie is a mess.  It's basically a bad episode of ""Star Trek"".  That two 90's teenagers could enlighten a 50's sitcom town is frankly simple-minded and obvious.  Unfortunately, this point is driven home again and again in the movie with the subtlety of a pile-driver.  This movie has the same problem as several other movies that are intended to ""satirize"" tv and movie unrealities, and yet plays directly into them (e.g. Last Action Hero, The Hard Way).  The characters have laughs at the absurdity of the freeze-dried 50's TV family, and yet the movie comes together EXACTLY like a freeze-dried 90's comedy-drama.  The boy (Tobey Maguire) learns to express his anger (and turns to color, to show he is now an honest, self-aware, self-actualized person, I suppose) and the slutty girl (Reese Witherspoon) reads one book and suddenly...oooh!  She's in color and wants to go to college!  How nice and convenient!  How so quaint and...Hollywood. Shouldn't throw a stone from a glass house.  This movie's political agenda is blatant and silly.  The biggest laugh in the whole movie isn't even intentional, when the ice-cream guy (Jeff Daniels) paints an ""illegal"" mural that shows nudity, kissing, and books such as ""Moby Dick"" with angels wings to epitomize all that is free-thinking in the world (like I said, subtle it ain't).   The B&W vs. color effects are excellent, but that's the only thing in this movie that can be described as such.  What could have been a reasonably funny premise is lost in the preachy, illogical screenplay and direction, which reduces the movie from being simply overlong and trite to being pretentious and calculating.  Big, BIG thumbs down.",Pleasantville
195,john-3109,Wanna life ?.. get one here !,10,15 January 2006,"This 1998 Gary Ross film is set in a small US town in the 1950's.Playing a teenage brother and sister contemporary with the film's release, Tobey Maguire and Reese Witherspoon find themselves back in the era of their own parents or grandparents, having arrived there via the medium of an old black and white television show with which they know well from TV re-runs.Star-struck and confused in disbelief at first, they begin to get to know the disarmingly straightforward characters from the show. Apparently too good to be true in the TV show, David and Jennifer discover that these people are somehow for real and endearingly child-like in their outlook on the world.Indeed, the whole town is somehow black and white, in a way that parallels their uncomfortably incomplete personalities and grasp of their own potential.Even more disconcerting for the two teenagers - they quickly find themselves parents to these inexperienced human beings who populate the Garden of Eden that is Pleasantville.It dawns early on David that they have a special responsibility towards these fragile individuals whose simple lives they unwittingly challenge and complicate by just being there.Skilfully using the metaphor of the progressive change from monochrome to colour to mirror the rapid personal development and coming of age of the whole community, a warm and gentle comedy threads through their reluctant progress towards a functional and independent existence.There's something disquieting about this film and something wonderfully reassuring. With Tobey McGuire's character David we see a heart-warming transformation from a squabbling teenager at the opening of the film into a resourceful and dependable catalyst for the essential personal obstacles that these outdated black and white characters must overcome.In Reese Witherspoon's character Jennifer, we feel less comfortable. Confronted with their obvious vulnerability and naïveté, she is not slow to play the situation to her own advantage with little grasp of what is special about them, and why they warrant this careful handling that her brother is at pains to supply.Wrapped up in this film is much of the confusion that seems to underpin family relationships over the lifetime of any individual. It's not always clear at any point in the film who's in need of looking after and why, but by some mysterious process almost everybody is transformed and enriched by the subtle revolution that is wrought by these unlikely visitors from the future",Pleasantville
196,lbk,Fell flat on its back,6,6 January 2003,"It started out so promising. An original idea, mystery, atmosphere, technically stunning ... And then suddenly midways it falls flat on its back with heavy handed morality, spoon feeding the viewer. If the film makers had relied on a little intelligence, subtleness and left some room for the viewer to think, it would have been a winner of all times.A film can be as magic and fantastic as it may be but it MUST be true to its own inner logic and framework. This one isn't. Suddenly nice squares turns into monsters. Hocus-pocus. It's another vehicle for the old cliche that old - or just mature - people are square, evil and fascist whereas teenagers are broad-minded, caring and loving. BS! And the ""deep"" painter character is so overdone it is laughable, what a shame.I got the feeling of a slick producer/director sucking up to the teenager group telling them they know it all, that they are always right whatever they do BECAUSE they are young. Although they are closely linked to the subject of this film, the concepts of experience of life and knowledge are happily ignored in this politically correct disaster.",Pleasantville
197,Spod-3,"A delightful, under-rated surprise",10,23 March 1999,"Finally a movie which delivers what the Truman Show, for all its hype, failed to do: show that the best fantasy world you can construct is never as good as the real world, regardless of its faults and shortcomings. This is the best mainstream Hollywood film since the Shawshank Redemption, and in a year of overhyped, over-Oscar-nominated 'great' films it quietly succeeds brilliantly in what it sets out to do. Joan Allen is breathtaking as she discovers (not just in the bath!) everything that was missing from her life before, and the cynical 90s kids get a chance to be something other than merely cool and nihilistic, as all other teenagers seem to be portrayed in today's movies. It's a film about what matters in life, and the fact that it can do that without endless schmaltz, flag-waving, syrupy ballads or ponderous narration makes it that much fresher and magical. This is a true feel-good cinema experience, and it's a pity more films dont leave you like that.",Pleasantville
198,Phoenix-36,"Entertaining and thought provoking. A ""must see""",8,4 February 1999,"Suppose you suddenly found yourself trapped in the old television show ""Father Knows Best."" The world is black and white and life is perfect. The basketball team never loses, Mommy dearest cooks four course breakfasts, and it never rains. Perfect right? Unless, of course, you refuse to follow the script. Once you deviate from the script, everything starts to fall apart.This is the clever and very effective premise of Pleasantville. David and Jennifer are brother and sister in a very imperfect 90's family. In a fight over the television remote control, they are transported into the television show Pleasantville. David is the reigning Pleasantville trivia champ and a devout fan. He can quote scripts word for word. (Danger, danger Will Robinson! I can quote Monty Python scripts until my fiance kicks me under the table. In the shins. Hard.)  Jennifer, however, thinks it is stupid and corny. Once it is clear what has happened (even if the Why? is as yet unresolved) David is thrilled and Jennifer is outraged. David finally has the nuclear family he has always wanted. Jennifer is aghast at her pasty complexion. While David slowly recognizes which episode they have been trapped in, Jennifer charges off on her own, refusing to follow the script.The nice, bland, white-bread world can't handle the variety. When Jennifer seduces the high school hunk, the ""scripts"" fall apart. Couples who previously were contemplating holding hands are suddenly discovering the Kama Sutra in the back seat on Lover's Lane. Suddenly the basketball players can't make a shot. They actually lose a game and the entire town is quietly nonplussed. The men in the barber shop suddenly understand the phrase ""You can't win them all."" More importantly, the world starts to turn into a color world. At first it is just a patch of color here and there. A rose, an umbrella, a young girl's tongue. As the people in Pleasantville start to explore possibilities their world leaves the old black and white behind.The change from black and white to color is handled very deftly and it serves a number of functions. First, it provides a visible symbol of the sense of freedom and possibility that gradually seep into Pleasantville. Second, it serves to give rise to an exploration of prejudice (it gives rise to a very clever visual pun on ""colored""). The gradual transformation to color is quite effective. Although we have seen the same technique in isolated scenes or ads, the effects here really serve the story well.If this movie were just one clever idea, it would be like a Saturday Night Live skit-a one liner dragged out for twelve (or in this case ninety) minutes. But writer/director Gary Ross has more up his sleeve than just a clever idea. He has created a charming and warmly felt movie. We are given two wonderful stories that draw the plot out in fine detail.First, David and Jennifer's parents start to have a few problems. Betty (played by Joan Allen) turns ""colored"" as she explores an art book with soda shop owner Mr. Johnson (Jeff Daniels). Johnson has always loved painting his windows for the holidays. With the coming of color, he is given an art history book that brings his artistic soul from a banked ember to a full blaze. Betty is drawn in, and she poses for an expressionist nude in the soda shop window. Trapped in Pleasantville's first thunderstorm, she spends the night with Mr. Johnson. Meanwhile, her husband George arrives home, puts up his hat, and cries out ""Honey, I'm home!"" Betty is nowhere to be found, dinner is not on the table or in the oven. When she does turn up she is in full color. George tries to reassure her that the color will go away. ""But I don't want it to go away!"" she replies. The breach is irresolvable, and she leaves him for Mr. Johnson. (Later, when George visits David in jail, he brings a bottle of martini olives, the only food in the house he can find.) It's a touching scene, well rendered.The later exploration of prejudice/racism arises very believably. Had it been handled poorly, it would have felt gratuitous or merely tacked on. But here we see its source. As life slips from its comfortable, reassuring ruts, some are not happy with the change. They don't like all the color, changing roles, new music and upheaval. They are not evil, just weak, frightened, and unequipped to cope with the new world. At first, they seek some sort of compromise. They decree a new ""code of conduct"" legislating music, allowable colors, etc. Of course, it is perfectly acceptable if you want to remain in the rut. For many of the liberated coloreds it is just another form of surrender. As the ""coloreds"" are persecuted by the ""black-and-whites"" a huge wall of graffiti becomes a form of protest, leading to a courtroom showdown.This is quite a tribute to the power of the individual and the importance of freedom. We have seen the police state held up as the opposite of freedom, and we are correctly frightened of it. But this movie shows us an altogether more insidious version of such repression. Repression does not automatically mean nasty, evil, or cruel. It can be pleasant, palatable, and prosperous. This is the kind of prejudice that everyone faces in every day life. And the sources of prejudice and control are not just radicals. They are our own family, our friends, our coworkers. Their expectations and need to pigeon hole us have a subtle, cumulative force that takes strength and courage to oppose. And it shows how, in many ways, it takes very little to oppose those forces.",Pleasantville
199,JonB-2,A film that's not as smart as it thinks it is...,5,29 May 1999,"The critics drooled over this one originally, which I should always remember is a big warning sign -- stay away.  While the premise is intriguing, it's essentially a high concept, one joke movie.  Worse, the filmmakers weren't exactly sure what story they were telling, so the metaphor switches directions a couple of times, lots of attempts at ""explaining"" only make things more confused, and some of the parallels between what's going on in Pleasantville and real world events (Nazis, race riots, etc.) are so heavy handed they might as well have just run a crawl across the screen: ""This is just like when Hitler ordered all books by Jews burnt.  Oooh. History...""It's a shame, because the movie hits on an interesting idea at the very beginning, but it was probably an accident.  Mainly, the trip to ""Pleasantville"" is set up as largely a reaction of Toby Maguire's character to the sucky world of the 90s.  (Unfortunately, this concept is utterly trashed by the appearance of Don Knotts as a TV Repairman, a useless character that probably happened because several studio execs were confused. ""B-b-but... how does he get into Pleasantville?  I don't understand..."") Anyway, the world of Pleasantville, under the surface, is really a political correctness freak's wet dream, NOT a version of the 1950s -- but we're led into it from the start knowing that this place is entirely wrong, and that's where all the potential ends.By far the most annoying aspect of the film, though, is that the filmmakers don't bother to give us the most important scenes.  At several points, when we're about to hit an emotional moment that might mean something, bang, we cut away to something else.  It's almost like the movie was cut with a stop watch.  As a result, it's impossible to care about anyone, because we never get to see the moments that matter to them.  (The most heinous examples of this come in the Joan Allen/Jeff Daniels relationship.  I think something happens between them, but it's hard to tell.)I won't even mention that Gary Ross hasn't bothered to think about the rules of the world here.  The TV Repairman character is inconsistent -- eager to send people into the place at one moment, outraged that things are changing in another.  As another IMDB reviewer pointed out, the reasons for people changing from black and white to color are also inconsistent.  At first, it seems like getting laid is the way to colorization, but at the end of the film, we learn that there are other reasons, and are left to wonder why the entire town hadn't turned technicolor a lot sooner.I don't know why the critics raved.  Maybe because nothing blows up and most of the film is in black and white.  But, if you want  great visual effects that actually have a compelling story attached to them, tune in to a Gatorade commercial.  Don't waste  your time on Pleasantville, because there's nothing there you haven't seen already -- or can't guess long before it happens.",Pleasantville
200,lists-9,A lovely film,9,17 March 2001,"This is probably my favourite film ever. The humour, the brilliant use of colour and, above all, the warmth of the characters, shine through the whole movie. Almost the entire cast give ""lovable"" performances, but my particular favourites are Tobey Maguire as David, the catalyst of the story (also the saving grace of The Cider House Rules) and Joan Allen as the initially naive but wonderfully sympathetic mother.(Possible spoilers)The people who criticise its politics and take it as an apology for a life without morality or responsibility seem to have missed the point completely - that, in life, there are no simple answers. The sexual and moral liberation of some of the characters is NOT a one-way street - Reese Witherspoon's (in one of the film's best scenes) actually retreats from her hedonistic lifestyle and finds fulfilment in study.A feel-good film par excellence that is the perfect antidote to the cynical nastiness of films like Pulp Fiction. The only minor flaws are the ease with which the villain is overcome and the unsubtlety of some of the social comment. Nine out of ten - wonderful.",Pleasantville
201,antiwolf,Warning: This movie contains ideas! ;-),10,16 February 2002,"I love this movie.  It's a good companion piece to ""The Truman Show"":  Both movies have similar themes that complement each other well. I can see that some people who thought they were just getting a simple, mindless comedic romp might not like it.The movie is a fairy tale, and as such you have to let some of the implausibilities slide.  However, ""fairy tale"" does not mean ""kid stuff"" - not until Disney came along were the two so closely equated.Many people are nostalgic for a perfect past, but this perfect past never really existed.  The point of the movie isn't ""have sex and you'll become enlightened.""  The point is that having real experiences and engaging with life will open up your mind.  In the movie, what really opens people's minds is art and the Library.The movie isn't ""preachy"" it just contains ideas.  You are free to accept, reject or ignore them, but I do not think that an expectation of an idea-free zone is reasonable.",Pleasantville

203,49235781,Superb.,10,18 February 1999,"What can I say about Pleasantville?  Mere words cannot describe the impact this movie has. From reading other people's comments, it seems as though they are the kind of people who watch individual scenes and don't bother to look at a film as a whole.The relationships that are fostered in the movie between all the characters in the movie really provokes one's train of thought.I have to admit, I've seen the movie twice, and am bracing myself to purchase it on DVD when it's released in March.  I've cried every time towards the end of the movie.  No spoilers here, but I just find myself becoming emotionally tied up in the characters every time I see Pleasantville.I think the Academy really has to get off their high horse and actually take a look at all they year's offerings before they make their decisions. Pleasantville had Oscar written all over it, and it seems as though the Academy was illiterate.If Pleasantville is still running in second-run in your town and you haven't seen it yet, GO!  Don't wait!",Pleasantville
204,Rumples-2,Beautiful but overdone,8,31 October 1999,There is no question that this is a wonderful film and beautifully presented. There is also no doubt that it starts to labour over some issues and even misrepresents some concepts of the nineties vs the fifties morality. In all 'though very enjoyable. 8/10,Pleasantville
205,gkearns,Fantasy come to life,10,6 October 2001,"SPOILERS AHEAD David (Tobey Maguire) and Jennifer (Reese Witherspoon) are twin brother and sister, linked by DNA, and little else. They are exact opposites in just about every way. He's a well-read nerd, carries on long-distance imaginary conversations with the most attractive girl in school, and obsesses on the fifty's black and white family sit-com, ""Pleasantville."" Jennifer doesn't waste her time reading, is popular in school, and obsesses on sex. Suddenly, by magic both are transported into the black and white world of ""Pleasantville. The impact of these two modern-day kids on that one-dimensional culture is explosive. SPOILERS. Jennifer brings the joys of sex and passion to the people of Pleasantville, and David opens their eyes to an exciting outside world they never knew existed. However, Jennifer and David, themselves, are changed dramatically. BIG SPOILERS COMING. Jennifer finds joy in other things besides just sex and popularity; she becomes an avid reader; and in the end remains in Pleasantville to attend college, an opportunity not available to her in her original life. David finds himself suddenly the center of attention, a hero, and popular; and the prettiest girl in Pleasantville, Margaret (Marley Shelton), falls in love with him. However, having grown up, so to speak, he accepts the opportunity to return home. The movie touches on several issues - social, political, and personal - including how reading and literature can change the outlook of people; how important color is in the appreciation of art ... and life; how passions vitalize people; how insidious racial intolerance is; and how static cultures fear the written word. The importance of the written word is especially emphasized here. However, there's an even more profound and important message delivered by this movie. Actually, it comes in one of those short, unheralded golden movie moments, which sometimes in a matter of a few simple seconds, define a good movie. It took me several months and many viewings to catch the significance of that moment in ""Pleasantville,"" a moment so seemingly unimportant that I originally gave it little more than a passing thought; in fact it seemed to me somewhat irrelevant until I finally figured it out.SPOILER. David is about to push the TV remote button that will send him back to his present day home. Margaret hugs him tightly, and as tears roll down her cheeks, says to him, ""Don't forget about me. Even if you never come back, I just don't want you to forget about me."" As I watched that scene for the umpteenth time, it struck me. Margaret was the symbol of his fantasy come to life. And it was important for him. It would indeed be tragic if he forgot Margaret and the beauty she brought to his life through his fantasy, as well as the value his life gained from the changes Margaret and his fantasy world wrought in him. Fantasy isn't to be taken lightly.An excellent piece of work by Tobey Maguire, Reese Witherspoon, Joan Allen, Jeff Daniels, Jane Kaczmarek, William H. Macy, Marley Shelton, J. T. Walsh, and the rest of the ensemble cast - and by writer-director Gary Ross and his entire production team.",Pleasantville
206,jarius,"A nice, somewhat tame, film that seems to make people think.",8,2 July 2002,"I truly enjoyed this film and it´s light social commentary. As I understand it the film is about the fact that accepting change and diversity is something valuable. The main point is that confronting your own prejudices and accepting the diversity in our lives make it so much easier to enjoy and appreciate. The fact is that every society throughout human history that has stopped evolving, and focused on preserving the Status Quo, has broken down. This is especially true to societies that refuse to accept new ideas and intellectual independence. And as I understand it, keeping the social Status Quo and protecting an abstract idea called ""the American way of life"" was the main goal of the 50´s U.S. culture. Remember that this was a time in U.S. history when people were punished for their ideals and thoughts via the oppressive structure called McCarthyism.In this, very light and in my opinion surprisingly tame, film this is shown in the way people react to the coloureds, i.e. the people who start to brake social conventions. And it is not until the people of Pleasantville start accepting change that they can see the problems in their society.Now I have to admit that I have trouble understanding all aspects of U.S. culture. That is why I have a hard time understanding the critique that some commentators have posted against this film. I know that, especially in the U.S., sexuality and rebellion against social tabu´s is a touchy subject.
But that is what makes this a good film, it actually manages to make people think and that is all too rare in contemporary American cinema.",Pleasantville
207,JacksonW0523,great and wholesome movie,8,4 June 2020,I liked this movie and its concept of being transported to a tv show where it's all black and white. The cast were good. I like the symbolism of change and how people react to it. There were slight references to politics of a certain era that I felt worked perfectly. The only downside is that I felt like some parts of the movie slowed down a bit and I felt a little bored. Also there was like a plot hole that I would've liked to see answered about a character and what they did at the end of the film.,Pleasantville
208,Jared X,"Manipulative, Condescending, and Pretentious",5,29 April 1999,"Rather than fessing up to the fact that he is attempting to make a subversive mainstream movie, Gary Ross utilizes a thesaurus of cinematic devices (such as oversaturated images from our collective American subconscious) to tell a moralistic story, and I think inescapably, an argument in favor of, or at least receptive to, the colorization of classic films.I liked the film technically.  But I question the simultaneously auteristic and totalitarian in-your-face message. I'm not angry, just disappointed with the demagoguery, no matter how creatively employed.My guess is that most audiences do not like to feel preached to, even if, and particularly if, the message is the force-feeding of tolerance.Many films, such as A Clockwork Orange, more matter-of-factly explore repression, self-repression and the consequence of blindly accepting loaded imagery.Unlike Kubrick, Pleastantville gives the audience very little credit.Nevertheless, the shot of J.T. Walsh, exuberant from bowling a strike, is exceptionally brilliant, irrespective of whether or not it is an intentional allusion to Howard Hawks, et al.",Pleasantville
209,Dccra1,"It was a ""good"" thing for Pleasantville....",3,3 January 2001,"It was a ""good"" thing for Pleasantville that Barney Fife (Don Knotts) gave that hokey remote (now there's a quality premise for ya) to the right teenagers... I mean, WOW! What if the remote got into the hands of kids that didn't believe in promiscuous sex? I actually know some kids who ""still"" hold conservative values (and believe it or not, they are happy, and I know this because they are in color!!!), and what if it got into their hands? I mean what a disaster this film would have been if Barney didn't send a girl who was willing to seduce a black and white character from an old TV show on the first night she's there, without even getting freaked-out about her strange new circumstances (which convinced me that she qualified for her first ""gang-bang"" video!!). Really, Pleasantville was very lucky because the remote wasn't even meant for her, even though she was the catalyst to the town ""finding itself."" Of course, David (Bud) is an excellent brother! Not concerning himself when his sister is tells him that she's had ""all kinds of sex,"" but staying focused on ridding a 50's fantasyland of it's values, he learned in the end that no place is perfect while helping ""poor"" Pleasantville understand the power of ""choice.""Just in case you haven't figured it out, this film disgusted me. Once again we are indulged by the minds of those who detest absolutes yet weave a tale framed in an ""absolute"" ideology! I commend Gary Ross, the book burning was a good touch. This movie was politically and socially motivated. ""Absolutely"" teaching that ""Conservatism"" is bad and ""Liberalism"" is good. Choice? I see Ross making a sequel... this time maybe having kids come from out of Pleasantville to the present, maybe getting suspended when they pray in school,or maybe getting blown away after being asked if they believe in God or not!!! This movie should have been about moral decay, not evolved enlightenment!However, I did feel that the special effects as well as the acting was fantastic. That's why a gave it a 4... nope... that's right I gave it a 3. I took a point off just because it was rated too high! I stand alone here in the IMDb's user comments area, and I'm still in color!!

The casting is perfect, special kudos to Macey, who was born for the role.  My main problem with the movie is that it goes on too long and thus loses part of the impact of its 'message'.

Pleasantville is no exception.  It's a sweet, moving and funny tale of two teenagers who get stuck in a 50s TV show. The movie does get a bit slow and preachy in the second hour, but the charismatic presence of Maguire and Witherspoone and the great effects make up for that.Most Memorable Movie Moment: Reese Witherspoone going to the bathroom, only to discover there is noneRating: 8/10",Pleasantville
212,nti-547-765973,"Insightful, beautiful, transformative, touching",9,21 July 2020,"I have seen a couple of reviews politicizing this movie and that doesn't do it justice. This film doesn't have an agenda, it doesn't promote liberal or conservative values, it is just a portrait of the relationship humanity has with CHANGE. It simply shows how people react to it in others, in themselves, in society. This is about opening to life, about being flexible in the face of newness, not throwing traditions away. If you take the movie as a metaphor, which seems to be how it was intended, color, as a character here, simply stands for richness of new experiences. I'd say this is a movie for anyone who is open to being moved, it is soulful, bright and an instant classic. Loved it!",Pleasantville
213,Costu-2,"A wonderful movie, on many levels",8,15 November 1999,"In addition to being an enjoyable movie for the story alone (and the creative treatment of the subject matter), ""Pleasantville"" also presents a number of interesting ideas for the thoughtful viewer to ponder afterwards : the nature of prejudice, what it is that makes us human, what it means to love another -- just to suggest three. -- The acting is uniformly superb, especially on the part of Toby Maguire and Joan Allen (yet another underrated actress!). Randy Newman's score well-deserved its Academy Award nomination, as it is, by turns, both a successful pastiche of 1950s TV music and a moving lyrical commentary on the action. The sole objection to be lodged against the film is that it seems a trifle too long. Otherwise, an enjoyable, eminently watchable, and ultimately intriguing movie.",Pleasantville
214,ralphgillis,A Bittersweet Fantasy,9,11 September 2021,"11 September 2000.I had seen Siskel and Ebert's review for Pleasantville and they both absolutely adored it and put it on their list of the best films of 1998. Me being a big fan of them two, I instantly bought the film.In the 1990s, (David and Jennifer) two teenagers get transported into a sitcom that takes place in the 1950s. A world that is in black and white with people who have never seen any other colour in their life. They need to follow the formula of the episode that would air on TV to not confuse the neighbourhood and mess with the citizen's lives.Pleasantville has a sweet and comforting atmosphere to it. Everyone seems so innocent because they have never experienced what the world is really like. They are hidden from outside interference and live a sweet and joyful life, away from all the problems today's society has to face. Everything is always the same, the entire town is in black and white so nothing feels different or stands out and everyone acts the same because they're supposed to act that way. Why wouldn't they, they live in a perfect world.Seeing the citizens distance themselves from the fantasy they live in and gradually discover what real life truly looks like is extremely interesting and can be quite emotional. The entire cast does an amazing job with making the situation seem believable and realistic. The viewer is gonna get so used to the bittersweet tone of the movie because of the B&W filter. It hides beauty and the art of colour,so when we eventually see colour it can almost be perceived as a sigh of relief that natural beauty is still out there and is present in this fantastical town.I highly recommend Pleasantville.",Pleasantville
215,Franklin-2,Liberalism reduced to a '50s sitcom level.,7,26 October 1998,"I thought there was a lot to enjoy in ""Pleasantville,"" despite a slow start. I particularly liked the cast-you can't get much better than Joan Allen, William Macy and Jeff Daniels-but when the film turns serious towards the end it turns kind of chowder-headed.  I'm a card-carrying liberal myself, but I thought the whole-hearted assault on white male privilege was a tad overdone and downright insulting.  It's a pity as some of the treatment of this sitcom world accidentally invaded by real life is really quite well done, particularly the music choices.",Pleasantville
216,snaunton,An allegory for American in October 2001,8,20 October 2001,"Watching movies is a disturbing experience these days.  Since the outrages of September 11, 2001, we notice so many movies with shots of the old, wonderful, New York; a New York with the World Trade Center dominating the skyline.  The scene in ""A.I"", of New York drowned, with only the WTC towers above the waters, is perhaps the most horribly ironic.  There have been many comments on the brilliant allegory that is ""Pleasantville"".  Suddenly, though, it seems so apt for this time.  It is a story of a paradise more naive than innocent, suddenly and uncomfortably presented with the beauty and fear of reality experienced in its full complexity.  ""Pleasantville"" seems now to illustrate the process that America and its people are said to be experiencing, a looking outwards, a growing awareness of its position, of its unique power, among the nations; but also an apprehension of the vulnerability that America's people shares with us all, in a dangerous and sometimes evil world.  Their success in this process is of historic importance to our world.",Pleasantville

I still would have bought my ticket, but with an unhealthy skepticism--an inner voice would have been whispering, ""Vanity project.vanity project.vanity project!""  After all, there is something to be said for having an open mind. Writer/director/producer Gary Ross (screenwriter of ""Big"" and ""Dave"") has dreamed up an oddball alternate reality in which everyone lives in a 1950s television sitcom not unlike ""Leave It to Beaver.""  Culture clash ensues when two 1990s teen-agers (Tobey Maguire and Reese Witherspoon) find themselves somehow part of the perfect black-and-white TV family.  Their new ""parents"" (William H. Macy and Joan Allen) are blithely unaware that anything untoward has happened.  The developing melodrama is delightful and full of gentle humor.  The four principals are fine--Joan Allen, in particular, delivers a devastating performance as a mother  realizing her own ignorance and learning about the fullness of life from her children. The supporting cast (which includes Don Knotts, Jeff Daniels, and J. T. Walsh in one of his final roles) is wonderful.  The integration of color with black-and-white cinematography is stunning, at times direct, at others subtle.  The underlying messages are not hidden, but are there in plain view for anyone to find.",Pleasantville

The movie about two kids trapped in an old time tv show of the 1950's isn't really about the perils of being trapped inside a set it is about the changes that life brings and the nuances these changes can create, why sometimes something so new and wonderful can be scary and heartbreaking all at the same time.  Pleasantville is about life and  in all its wonderful chaotic glory and the wonder and challenge of change.  This movie about a sitcom town is about everyone's town, everyone's home, everyone's country, everyone's state this movie is about tv characters about is about what it means to be human. 10/10",Pleasantville

220,graycat-1,Why April 1958?,8,29 April 2005,"As much as I admire this movie (which is really a time-travel story; more A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court, than Huckleberry Finn), I'm puzzled by the choice of April, 1958.A little research suggest 1954 was the watershed year for all the Pleasantvilles in the U.S.Googling can help us return to April, 1958.The covers of Life Magazine for April 1958 featured the following personalities on the covers: April 7, Sugar Ray Robinson's victory over Carmen Basilio; April 14, Broadway legend Gwen Verdon; April 21, the John F. Kennedy family; April 28, Willie Mays and the Giants move to San Francisco. All in color by the way.Elvis is drafted March 24, 1958.1958 is the year of the Ford Edsel. (Actually introduced in the fall of 1957, I believe).The Donna Reed Show begins, but not until September.And now for 1954: RCA begins broadcasting in color and markets the color television more or less as we know it today. (A CBS attempt at TV color had failed two years earlier.) Brown v. Board of Education (Topeka, Kansas) established desegregation in public schools as the law of the land. (Kansas, the home state of Dorothy and Toto, from that other movie filmed in black and while and color; I mean the Wizard of Oz.) Father Knows Best begins.Another interesting confluence of dates: Gary Ross was born in 1956, the year that most unlike Pleasantville novel Peyton Place was published.So I repeat, why April 1958? I had hoped that the director might comment on the date during his DVD commentary, but when the calendar appears he says nothing at all.I was born in 1943. I was a high school sophomore in 1958. I learned to drive on my father's '56 Buick. I would really like to know why April 1958.",Pleasantville
221,Cincy,You must see it twice,9,25 September 1999,"On a second viewing, I found ""Pleasantville"" to be amazing, especially from a Director/Writer (Gary Ross) with such slim earlier credits (""The Flintstones,"" ""Big"").Special effects and the plot mechanic absorb the viewer the first time. Once you get over wondering, ""How did they do that?"" you can listen to the story and appreciate the serious questions posed about popular culture, mass culture and the survival of the individual.I particularly was taken by the trenchant mayor's assertion that only a ""non-changeous view of history shall be taught in the schools.""All of the performers are good, but I think Joan Allen and Jeff Daniels especially rose to occasion, as they deal with the anguish of finding their new selves.  William H. Macy is good, too, but in a role he's played too many times.Change beats us all up every day, but this movie lets us see that it is a precious gift.  ""I don't know"" becomes an assurance, not a defeat.",Pleasantville

Kudos to Reese Witherspoon and Toby McGwire in the major roles, Joan Allen and William H. Macy in the ""show within a show"" roles.  An excellent supporting performance is provided by the late J. T.

224,snazel,Heavy Handed but Clever,7,3 November 2005,"This movie wields a very heavy hammer and bludgeons you with its theme. It also suffers slightly from hypocrisy. It suggests that media entertains us with sanitized environments that we then assume are ""normal"" and thus we get caught trying aspire to them. However, the film ends with its own ""happy endings"", that were for me, just as contrived as the conclusion of a Brady Bunch episode.As a result, the film ultimately can become as hollow and simplistic as the very media it pretends to deconstruct.None the less, the film is worthy. It is technically marvelous, it has genuine moments in it and the soda shop owner has a fine evolution in the film. In many ways for me, he became the most ""real"" character in the whole film.The film also pays heavy homage to other movies. For example, the courtroom smacks of ""To Kill a Mockingbird""; at one point the protagonist proclaims victory in the rain in direct reference to ""Shawshank Redemption"", there are biblical allusions as well and scenes stolen from situation comedies and supplanted into the film with ironic twists.While I enjoy the film and hold it higher than most fare out of Hollywood, ultimately the theme is just too black and white. The ""convervatives"" in the film transition into narrow paranoia too quickly and there's never any consequence to the people who choose to ""liberate"" themselves. Every choice made to break society's mold makes the characters happy, free and comfortable. Every change in this film is ""good"", every single one.Life doesn't work that way, but this film does. As a result, the notes it tries to hit are just a little too heavy and sharp.Ultimately the film is ""pleasant"", it doesn't challenge you too much, it provides happy endings and lets you know pretty clearly what is bad and what is not, and makes sure the ""good"" guys win out.It is a very ""pleasant"" film indeed.",Pleasantville

The only thing that bothers me a bit is the fact that it emphasizes so much on sex. Don't get me wrong, sex is nice, but it seems -- toward the end -- that the makers of this movie realized that they had only used sex as the thing that would ""wake people up"" ie. give them color.

228,breezybrisbane,Yuck,1,13 November 2005,"This movie is awful. While it contains several good points about the same-old same-old style of Pleasantville,and it's heart is in the right place, there are different ways that they could have made this movie without filling it with sex. I had to watch it in my civics class, since it is so political. In my opinion, the two ""modern kids"" totally ruined the society. Sure it was boring, but everyone was happy. The statement it seemed to make is that living in the perfect, happy, albeit corny, world of Pleasentville is not as nice as living in a world of divorce, fighting and promiscuity.How come every time we see a movie about the 50's, movie makers must pervert it? We are all used to seeing the era through ""Leave it to Beaver"" coloured glasses, but filmmakers seem to think we would rather see it as today's world fifty years ago. Do you sort of get what I'm saying?Everyone will have different opinions of this movie, but I just gave you mine. Don't rent this movie thinking it's Pleasant (har-de-har), or because Don Knotts is in it.",Pleasantville
229,1001,Technically proficient but simplistic,4,12 November 1998,"Pleasantville has been favorably compared to The Truman Show, which premiered earlier this year. However, I feel Pleasantville doesn't hold a candle to The Truman Show. While Truman offered genuine pathos, a sympathetic, even heroic lead, and insight into the intrusive nature of television, Pleasantville is overlong, repetitive, simplistic, and hollow.The plot of Pleasantville has two modern-day teen-agers being magically transported to a fictional T.V. show set in the '50's, called Pleasantville (by no less a character than Don Knotts, the movie's only inspired idea). The boy, played by Toby Maguire, likes it there - it's a nice respite from his family problems, which includes his sister, played by Reese Witherspoon. She is transported with her brother, but feels she has entered Nerdville, and so sets out to change her surroundings to something she is more familiar with, something with a more 90's sensibility, like, say with...sex?This is actually an interesting premise, especially since the 50's world is in black and white, and only gradually introduced to color. Unfortunately, the movie takes a black and white attitude in its morality too, hammering the same point home over and over again. I think the movie is basically saying the 50's was a time of stifling conformity, dull and unimaginative culture, and in the end, threatening and oppressive patriarchy. The 90's, on the other hand, offers ultruistic freedom, better values, and color! to life.Please! One could make a better argument that the 90's offers moral decay and fear, as evidenced by broken families, teenage pregnancy, violence, and general cynicism towards all authority. The film takes the logically dubious step of taking 50's sitcom sensibility and making it the reality of that time. Just ask how 90's sitcoms accurately reflect 90's reality. One could defend the movie by saying that it is not making a literal 50's - 90's comparison, but is making the more general point that freedom is better than confromity. This is a truism and doesn't need over two hours to justify, and besides, the movie is taking that comparison seriously. The audience shouldn't.",Pleasantville
230,Morning Star,A wonderful film!!,10,31 May 2000,"""Pleasantville"" is one of my favorite films of the 90s.  Very original.  So much has been written here about it already by others.  I am amazed to see some people didn't ""get it"", but then some people think Claude Monet paintings are worthless too so it takes all kinds.  At times this film is just out and out funny (my favorite comic moments are when Macy comes home and says ""where's my dinner?"" and then the following bowling lane scene.) The whole point of the film is that when these characters/people get in touch with their inner feelings then they are in color and a true person, not a caricature of a human who just goes mindlessly through a boring routine life.  When they get in touch with their *dreams and feelings* then they are truly alive for the first time.  People who don't get this message from the film no doubt are leading boring routine lives and are not in touch with their true self...and they probably won't ever be. I've met many a person in my life like that and it's quite sad that they will exist for ___ amount of years but never be *alive*.  Gary Ross did an excellent job of conveying his serious message amid the comedy in this film.  And the special effect photography is marvelous!  Other films that have similar ideas and messages I'd say were:  ""Groundhog Day"", ""Field of Dreams"", ""Enchanted April"" and ""Purple Rose of Cairo""....I loved all of those too!",Pleasantville
231,tjw1973,"a great original film that is ""Trumanesque""",9,28 March 1999,"1998 may go down as the year Hollywood reclaimed some vision for its movies thanks to movies like Pleasantville and The Truman Show.  What makes Pleasantville so great is that it has so many layers despite its lack of color.  When color is used for a character it means that that character has passed to a new level of understanding about themselves and their world. They've unlocked some hidden potential they've had within themselves.  I would like to take a moment to defend this movie. It portrays a 1950's sitcom and some have taken this to mean that the filmmakers had something against the 1950s.  I STRONGLY disagree with this.  The key that some forget is that it is a fantasy of two kids with potential thrust into a world that seems to have none and is trapped within is black and white sitcom limitations.  This world is what it is and always will be until the kids change it and turn it from a ""sitcom world"" to ""REAL life"".  It is a must see movie and one of the decades top ten.",Pleasantville

233,theBIGlebowskiD,A movie that had potential...,3,28 March 2002,"PLEASANTVILLE definetly had potential and was thwarted by the use of sex. Explaining that sex will change us forever. Or if we hit someone in the face. I am saying, yeah maybe things like that would change us. But then it leads people to think that premarital sex is the only way to go. It comes off as a cheap movie trying to be a phenomenal motion picture. Affairs...ok. That changes us for the better? ""I think I will go cheat on my spouse. I am a better person."" The special effects were good, but it couldn't save this one. I thoroughly enjoy Tobey Maguire and Reese Witherspoon, and I love the late J.T. Walsh and William H. Macy.

234,rafael_jaramillo_avellan,"A perfect blend of fantasy, comedy and drama. One of the most beautiful films I've ever seen.",8,1 October 2016,"It is deeply touching, undeniably funny and has a resonant message that will touch your heart. There is no denying that Pleasantville (PV) is quality in entertaining, and definitely a 90's classic. PV works perfectly in many ways, so let's go stage by stage:Smart satire: ""The Perfect Family"", one of the social commentaries that this movie makes is that one. The concept of how a family should work, based on strong stereotypes from the 50's, but also on all-time ones. The Parkers are presented as an always happy family with a working father, a house-made mother, and energetic teenage children. It mocks about how television can easily sell this kind of ideas to the public. On the other hand, the sitcom's universe is an absolute winning formula.Precisely funny movie: Most of the movie's humor relies on sexual gags, but that doesn't stop it from being family friendly. The rest of the jokes help to get along with the magical tone of the story. Also, works fine as a coming of age flick. I loved the transition of Jennifer and David throughout the movie. From confused and both relaxed and stressed teenagers to full-aware, independent and emotionally intelligent adults (especially David).A feast for the eyes: Excellent cinematography and visual effects give points for a dazzling experience. The ""color transitions"" is a beautiful characteristic from PV. The eternal reflection that PV offers (alongside its visuals) make it one of the most beautiful films I've ever seen. I'll love to explain it all, but I try to spoil the less I can. What I can say is this: courage, letting flow, opening your eyes, allow your life get colored by life itself, trying new things. This and more, are some of the themes that the movie throws to the audience in a way that all can receive it smoothly. Drama enters here, both in the TV and real world, and it really reaches the soul.Last but not least, the cast and acting. Both fresh and young Reese Witherspoon and Tobey Maguire in charming roles that steal the show. Older, mature and talented William H. Macy, Joan Allen and Jeff Daniels give the movie a sense of ""it's never too late"" that is refreshing. Joan Allen was the winner here, she must have been nominated for a Golden Globe at least.FINAL CONSENSUS: Family friendly humor, profound social commentary and message, marvelous performances and visuals, Pleasantville is the perfect mix for a magical and heart touching ride.",Pleasantville
235,PolSci80,Things aren't always black & white,9,23 May 1999,"Ok, I COULD say that this movie was awesome due solely to the fact that it had Don Knotts in it.  However, there's more to Pleasantville's greatnessFor one thing, I thought its metaphors were very creative.  There was a link to Adam & Eve and the forbidden fruit, also one towards the civil rights movement---where 'coloreds' are shunned by the 'whites'.  I thought that was clever.Then there's the acting.  Joan Allen and William H. Macy turned in their token 'academy award worthy performances' as usual.  And of course the above mentioned cameo by Don Knotts--hilarious.  Toby Maguire was the standout here as a kid who for once feels needed and important in a world he knows he can't stay in for long.  And Reese Witherspoon is cool as his initially slutty sister, who unfortunately decides to cool it and become studious, ugh.Anyways, this was a great film.",Pleasantville
236,Mr Toad,Not a very challenging movie,5,23 February 2007,"This was not a challenging movie for Hollywood, ideologically. How difficult it must have been to convince a studio to fund a film in which Smaltown, America is shown for the homogeneous, prudish, uncreative and, worst of all, boring, place that it is.You get the sense the director had an affair and this movie was his attempt to convince his wife it was better for everyone that he did. It's a stupid idea and an entire feature length movie saying as much just shouldn't be taken seriously.The acting was good, the casting was good, the technical gimmick of selectively coloring things was all right (hadn't we been colorizing films for several decades by this point?). But the arrogant premise was just too much.",Pleasantville

From the previews alone, I knew I was going to like this movie.The cast alone is worth a viewing. Tobey Maguire is a hidden talent. Most enjoyable. In my eyes, Reese Witherspoon, cannot make a bad film. I have loved her since MAN IN THE MOON. She is truly talented and is surely one of the best contemporary actresses. Jeff Daniels is one of the most underrated actors of our time and he pulls off a great performance here. The same can be said for Joan Allen who brings such depth to any character she plays and is no different here. As for William H. Macy, he is always a pleasure to see, from FARGO to BOOGIE NIGHTS to right here in good old PLEASANTVILLE.Gary Ross is a true artist. Almost everyone can agree he is a wonderful writer (I remember his masterful work since I saw BIG), but who would've thought he'd turn out to be such a wonderful director as well. This man is a film genius. I can hardly wait for his next masterpiece.PLEASANTVILLE is the best film of 1998 and what I would consider a modern classic. A+! Perfect 10! Two thumbs up! A must see!",Pleasantville
238,lionlearn,Preachy Liberal Fundementalism,5,5 January 2001,"Intriguing, often hillarious, well- made, ""Pleasantville"" nevertheless left a sour after-taste for me. I felt like a liberal Jerry Falwell was standing on a podium, banging his version of the bible. I'm going to presume people have seen ""Pleasantville"" and cut to the chase. 1)I love a good book, fine art and great sex as well...Really! I also like the idea of small town Americana, which ""Pleasantville"" seemingly loathes. It's true that, even today, people can be stuck in an arcane, antiquated view of life. The fifties ARE gone, most likely ( hopefully ) never to return. Yet the Norman Rockwell places of America are dwindling rapidly, and many people cherish them. Myself included. 2 )Typical of Hollywood, there's a sore lack of spirituality in ""Pleasantville"". Not RELIGION, there's a difference. Wouldn't citizens of a liberated community discover the trancendance of THAT as well as the earthly pleasures? 
*POSSIBLE SPOILERS-WARNING!* 3) Yes, sex is fantastic, but not always. On on occasion girls DO get pregnant. It's unfortunate yes, but it's funny this film doesn't address this. ( Although most movies don't. Fantasies sell better ) 3) Narratively, Gary Ross' screenplay revelations are convoluted. Why did""Magical Don Knotts"" show up to give the kids the magic remote anyway?Why did he get upset when things on the show started changing. ( He must have known that would happen.) How is the boy going to explain to his mother that his sister has gone off to college in a paralel universe?Anyway, I gave up church for the same reasons.

It's a marvelous, well constructed flick and an enjoyable way to spend a couple hours.There's no blood, or explosions. A bit of sex, but nothing gratuitous and it's essential to the plot.

240,treagan-2,Misses the essential color question--race,6,1 May 2006,"Normally, it is not good critical practice to judge a movie about what it is not--usually it's better to analyze what a movie sets out to do, and evaluate how good it does it. Sometimes, the premise of a movie itself is not acceptable to a viewer, and the critic will take on that question.Here's where I feel PLEASANTVILLE should be criticized for what the filmmakers did not attempt to do: it missed an enormous opportunity. Its plot deceit is creative if far-fetched even for a fantasy--two teenagers from the 1990s being stuck in a 1950s black and white sitcom, and manage to liberate the town from 1950s sitcom thinking by introducing color, and, apparently, sex and art.The opportunity missed--and I believe it to be one very close to the heart of the film's main idea--is that the entire question of race was absent.Perhaps one can bring up the ""Technicolor"" aspect as suggesting race, as it suggests racial prejudice. But ... the transformations our society was to go through post 1950s has largely or everything to do with race--the music, the liberation, the insistence to change and include. It was really the Civil Rights Movement, and the gradual change in r attitudes that really changed us, made us different from the 1950s. The women's movement, sexual liberation, a critical analysis of America's role in the world through the anti-war movement, all had vital roots in Montgomery and Selma and Watts.What if, for example, the film were to end by introducing to black-and-white land a true ""colored,"" an African-American? The all-racially white world of Pleansantville would have had a whole new set of dichotomies to deal with.PLEASANTVILLE is clever, technically adroit, has some good performances, and a number of other things going for it, but it misses an obvious chance to add a dimension that was definitely there in the 1950s but left out of a film depicting the era.I also agree with some of the critiques of the film: it's preachy; it seems to embrace sexual infidelity as liberating non-conformity; it wrongfully shows the 1950s to be far more devoid of passion than they actually were. Even some of the sitcoms criticized, as one commenter pointed out, had more heart to them than was given credit to in Pleasantville. The filmmakers had every right to show things their way, and it's a legitimate position, I suppose, but one that rings a little hollow and facile.PLEASANTVILLE is a good movie, with some extreme strong elements and even some touches of magic, but it is hard to forgive it for ignoring the question of American apartheid, as if that had nothing to do with the limitations and blindnesses of that era.",Pleasantville
241,HailWell,Great film for Viewing!,9,19 May 2016,"This movie has a definite charm about it, starting with the fantasies of the main character caused by his harsh life and his hidden desires. Supernatural things happen in a fresh and enjoyable atmosphere. Pleasantville is realistically acted and I have not seen this sort of show before. I am impressed to see actor Don Knots in here since I was always amused at his comedies and his role on the Andy Griffith show. This movie has a great story line making it easy to develop and Pleasantville pleases the the audience when it becomes pleasant after all in an ironic way. For the audience, entertaining young people, and some older, the film follows along satisfyingly throughout. Pleasantville represents an extraordinary shift of settings which will provoke viewers' wonder. Any perspective you want to view this movie from, it stimulates a lasting impression on the movie-goer. This show is well worth trying for lighthearted fantasy entertainment. Many people should like it.",Pleasantville
242,big_ringer,An IMMENSELY underrated film!,9,23 March 2004,"I managed to catch ""Pleasantville"" when it was aired on TNT, and even though I only saw the last half of it, I liked what I saw immediately.  When the movie was commercially released, I didn't think a whole lot of it, thinking that it looked cookie-cutter, and now I feel that I've missed out, and have since brought it on DVD.I'm not going to go into the storyline synopsis, since so many of you probably already have seen it from the movie's main page.  I will, however, give examples of how this movie works.First of all, the special effects; this is a movie where the special effect enhance the story instead of them taking the place of the story.  The mixture of black-and-white with color is absolutely remarkable.  In my opinion, the characters changing from black-and-white to color is attributed to them breaking away from their normal ""routines"" and becoming more of a ""three-dimensional"" kind of person.  For example, Reese Whitherspoon's character is promiscuous and not intrested in doing much with her life,but when she  starts to read and study, she realizes that there is more to life than the next date.  Same with Tobey Maguire's character; when he gets sucked into that TV world, he's pretty introverted, not very quick to socialize.  As the days go by, he in a sense is responsible for instigating the rebellious nature of the other teenagers, and it hits a peak when he introduces violence to the town, even though he's defending his TV mother. It's at this point that he realizes that ""it's not supposed to be perfect...it's not 'supposed to be' anything.""Another big aspect that makes ""Pleasantville"" work is the character development.  In a sense, all of the characters are major stereotypes of themselves, but as the movie goes on, each character tends to become self-aware.  Several of the black-and-white characters are fighting so hard to keep the status quo that the characters in color are starting to become repressed (a rather obvious reference to segregation).There are several other parallels in the story (garden of eden, kristallnacht, etc), there are too many to mention in this one review. I'd just like to conclude by saying that I really recommend this movie to anyone who would be intrested in a good story and not just Hollywood pandering. It's not the perfect movie in the world, but definately one that people should take a cue from.Grade: A",Pleasantville
243,aldo-renato50,Pleasant movie experience,9,2 February 2010,"I saw this film on a Saturday afternoon and it really packed a wallop. As someone who was brought up on ""Leave It to Beaver,"" ""Father Knows Best,"" ""Ozzie and Harriet,"" etc., etc. I was ready to have any image of those series deflated very quickly. The images (in chilling black and white) of the perfect small town with perfect families and perfect people brought back memories of the above shows (What DID Ozzie do for a living?!) and a few others. Who didn't want parents or friends (or a life) like the ones in the movie?! The cast (among them a pre-Spiderman Tobey Maguire, William H. Macy, Joan Allen, Reese Witherspoon, Jeff Daniels, Marley Shelton, J. T. Walsh in his last role as the town leader, etc.) was one of the best ensembles ever assembled. Everybody had their big moment on screen. Add to this echoes of ""To Kill A Mockingbird,"" ""The Wizard of Oz,"" as well as touches of the above noted TV series and one has a great movie experience.

245,Scott-4,A must-see film in spite of social commentary overkill.,9,25 October 1998,"Like a lot of movies from the late 90's, ""Pleasantville"" is enjoyable to watch from a visual beauty standpoint.  The scene where Bud and his girl are driving out to Lover's Lane when the apple blossoms start to turn pink was so beautiful that tears welled up in my eyes.The movie goes on for a long time with one cute scene after another without really making a point.  Then the second half of the movie bites off more than it can chew on social commentary, and goes off in so many directions.The best ""point"" that the movie makes is that art, music, and literature are vital to humankind, and without them our life is so vanilla that it is not worth living.  It makes a basic anti-censorship statement and Mary Sue, the slutty girl from the 90's, discovers new emotions within herself by reading ""Lady Chatterly's Lover"" and other classical literature.",Pleasantville

My favourite chanteuse (Fiona Apple) was credited with two songs and loved what I heard. I thought any movie with songs by Fiona would be great.Well, I was disappointed in the soundtrack -- only got to hear Fiona at the very end -- but the movie was a pleasant surprise. The film was supported by a cast of very solid actors: W.H Macy, Joan Allen, Jeff Daniels -- though I don't think they lived out their full potential. But perhaps that was the idea -- they were playing very limited ""fictional"" characters.The movie deals with themes of racism, change, and passion. There's also some interesting allegorical reference.A pleasant movie. It may not change your life -- but it's worth a watch.",Pleasantville
249,DJRumpy,The human condition presented in black and white,9,22 May 2006,"I recently re-watched this gem of a movie. This is, by far, one of my favorite films to date. This initially appears to be a somewhat light film about 2 modern day characters ( Tobey Maguire and Reese Witherspoon) that have a run-in with Don Knotts as a T.V. repairmen. The outcome of which ends them both in the T.V. show of Pleasantville. A place where the temperature is always 72 degrees, the sun always shines, and everything is in black and white, and ...pleasant.After the initial shock wears off, both characters discover how 2-dimensional the characters in Pleasantville are. They find themselves as the main characters in a 50's T.V. show as children of George and Betty Parker. The actors in this film do a phenomenal job portraying a life devoid of passion. They find that all of the characters go about life in a mechanical fashion, without any knowledge of lust, hope, grief, or anger.Reese's character (Jennifer) quickly turns to her old ways, and promptly takes her 'boyfriend' (Paul Walker of The Fast and the Furious fame) to lovers lane. She shows him the joys of sex, at which point, the exodus from Eden begins. Shortly after Paul drops Reese off at home, he sees a single red rose. By red, I mean this is the only non black and white thing in Pleasantville. From here on the movie reaches out and grabs you. It turns into a cascading affect of self discovery, both good and bad for the citizens of Smallville. Initially all of the high school kids enter onto this path, as glimpses here and there of pink bubble gum, neon signs at the local hang out/diner, rose red lips, and curiosity about the previously unknown world outside of Pleasantville. The Diner and Lovers lane become a place of color in a black and white world with many allegories to The Garden of Eden.They discover things like love, lust, wonder about the world around them. This is where I disagree with many of the reviews here. This is a movie about passion. You have to look beyond the first and most obvious things that curious teenagers do. The changes in the children begin to happen with the parents. Suddenly dinner isn't cooked and ready at 6. A wife burns her husband's shirt with a iron because she was daydreaming. They see rain and rainbows in Technicolor for the first time, and a tree in front of the Parkers' household bursts into flame as the mother (Joan Allen) pleasures herself in the bathroom (with a little instruction from Reese Witherspoon on the facts of life). These scenes are all tastefully done.From here the film takes a turn into the darker side of human emotion. Soon, the 'coloreds' are drawing attention to the fact that things are changing in Pleasantville. Signs stating that no coloreds are allowed start appearing on Main Street while the coloreds continue to explore themselves and the world around them. Angry mobs begin to form, trying to stamp out any sign of change. As each person discovers passion in some form (whether hate, love, lust, bigotry, grief, regret), they turn into coloreds who then initially hide in the local soda shop, desperate to escape the angry mobs outside. A new city ordinance is passed declaring what music is acceptable, and what colors are safe (as long as they are a shade of gray).Jeff Daniels also shines here as the local Diner owner. He finds himself attracted to Miss Parker, who in turn finds herself drawn to him even though her character is 'happily' married. Daniels also finds he has a passion for art. He goes from a mechanical shop keeper to a person in love, who also stands defiant with Tobey Maguire in painting a naked mural showing Miss Parker. This sets off a riot, and ends with the Diner being trashed and a bonfire culminating in a book burning. Some of these moments have you sitting with a lump in our throat from the raw emotion the visuals and the music evoke from this film.Suffice it to say; this is one of the finest and most original films I've ever seen, and certainly not to be missed. For those that think this is an attack on moral values, you have missed the point. This is not about lust, or promiscuity. It simply shows that were are all human. We make mistakes. We love. We live. As a result, we have passions of which sometimes you cannot control.",Pleasantville

252,Cornelius Chesterfield,Pure manure,1,21 December 2002,"*spoilers, not that it matters*A couple of teenagers are thrust into the world of 1950 TV show Pleasantville. The girl, a slutty airhead or valleygirl or whatever you americans call those ""it's like, you know, totally!"" types, proceeds to bang the first guy to talk to her, and since sex doesn't exist in 50's TV shows, it turns their world upside down. We are then kindly told by the director/script-writers (complete with cheery music) that lots of sex with no feelings involved is better than having ultra-clean morals. After all, clean morals are for boring people. Tobey McGuire's character goes from calm geek to sex-starved teenager because some good-looking girl he never met made him cookies after he becomes popular (awwww, true love). This film is filled with such positive values.All in all, it's a very childish movie obviously written by an amateur. It even contradicts itself, since the nice people portrayed in Pleasantville would never turn into a fanatical violent mob. The worst scene is when the father of the family, who is consistently shown as a  nice guy throughout the movie (talking to his children, kissing his wife, etc), is ruined by doing a 180, he's turned into a close-headed chauvinist so that we can give the lively wife a big scene where she proclaims her independence about how she doesn't want to make dinner, that she wants to run off with another man. And we're actually supposed to be glad for the wife here.
Definitely pass.",Pleasantville
253,Chris-180,Pleasantville (Sequel) - just around the corner?,8,2 November 1998,"Without giving anything away--the end of the movie is the beginning of the sequel (no dah!).Evidently when writers don't have much to write about they tend to make up something, like creating two-dimensional characters in a three-dimensional world.While the plot is totally unrealistic, not so in a virtual reality scenario. Food for thought!!The film was enjoyable, but can lose its appeal rather quickly.One of the untapped resources of the plot was the fact when the brother-sister were dropped into the TV program, the TV characters they replaced were not shown in the real world. Had the writers done that there would have been two storylines about how each set of characters responded in world they had been place in--a rather more intriguing story complicated enough already and limited by viewing-time.Very entertaining!Rating: 9 out 10 stars",Pleasantville
254,Mr.Caca,HIGHLY Immoral!,1,26 November 1998,"Hey kids! Don't listen to your parents or that funny little voice in the back of your head that tells you not to put kitties in the microwave! Don't listen to anything but the sound of your raging hormones. Your parents might frown on any number of the exotic situations that pop up in this seemingly innocent movie. No, self restraint is a social evil that must be stamped out, like the annoying insect that it is. See Pleasantville, and you'll understand what I'm saying. In this film, two teens are magically sucked into a 50's sitcom through a remote control that a mysterious stranger gives them. And you thought Last Action Hero was corny! Inside the 50's world, everything is black and white. Life is simple ,and very happy. Everyone has a loving family, there's no crime, no depression, no drugs, no poverty. Just a happy town. One of the kids, a young girl, seduces one of the innocent townfolk. Shortly thereafter, he turns technicolor. Before long, teens EVERYWHERE are fornicating. The innocent TV mother of the film is corrupted by her new daughter from our world, and ends up touching herself in the bath tub. Then she goes to the local diner, and has her new lover paint a picture of her naked. Meanwhile, more teens fornicate. The young man from our world, who until now was relatively decent, is sitting in a park with his girlfriend, when she offers hima red apple. He takes a bite, and everything goes crazy. Then it rains a lot. Sound familiar? This movie pretends to be a meaningful film, with a deep messsage. There's lots of beautiful music, quirky characters, amazing special effects, and good acting. To tell the truth, this film could have been one of the best ever made. But instead, it was full of smut. I just don't understand how this movie got a PG-13 rating. the f-word was in it, plenty of nudity, lots of sex, and a corrosive message. Teenagers will get the wrong message, and think it's okay to fornicate. The ones that already are will feel like it's their right. This movie is definitely not for family viewing. At it's core, it's a filthy story about teenagers that fornicate, and corrupt a town full of innocent people.",Pleasantville
255,Eddie C.,"I heard about this movie, but I didn't know that it would be THIS good....",10,8 April 2000,"I knew what this film would be about before I rented it, but I'm stunned that it would be THIS good. Nothing against ""Saving Private Ryan"" or ""Shakespeare in Love"", but this film should have won Best Picture in 1998 and it was a shame that it wasn't nominated. It's an even bigger injustice that it did not get a nomination for best screenplay or cinematography.In the hands of another writer, this movie could have been made as just a parody of 1950's sitcoms like ""Leave It To Beaver"" or ""Ozzie and Harriet."" But this film isn't about how clichéd those series look decades later. It's about the false nostalgia for a past that never existed. We survived the past and we know that everything turned out all right. Because of this, we selectively choose our memories and weed out the unpleasant ones. That's why the past is sometimes seen as ""the good ol' days."" Pleasantville does not represent how the 50's actually were but rather an idealization of what people THINK the 50's were---no one had sex, everyone got along swell, and life was fairly easy. Nothing could be further from the truth, and there are many film from that era which show how real people (even in suburbia) actually lived. This film argues that free will and choice is ESSENTIAL to life and that we should embrace freedom instead of fearing it. It isn't just about making out, but having the OPTION to make out.Another reviewer claimed that this film was an attack on the 50's, but David and Jennifer could very easily have been dumped in the world of ""The Brady Bunch"", ""Gilligan's Island"" , or ""Batman."" But setting ""Pleasantville"" in a 1950's sitcom allows for the brilliant metaphor of black and white versus color. Black and white photography is a stylized depiction of the universe, but unless you're color blind it's not the way you actually see the universe. When we first see Pleasantville's citizens, all of them are cardboard cut-outs of stereotypes. As they begin to open up and become real people, color seeps into their world. The catalyst seems to be the willingness to experience new sensations and become vulnerable. Jennifer has slept with lot of guys when she was in the normal world, so sex does not change HER into a color character. On the other hand, when she actually finishes a book (without pictures) for the first time in her life, THEN she becomes colorized. Similarly, David does not bloom into color until he breaks out of his aloofness and defends his ""mother."" Compare the way he ignores his real mother at the beginning of the film to how he consoles and comforts her at the end to see how much David has changed.I could go on and on, but I think you get the idea. There are a lot of films out there that are very entertaining and/or very moving--like ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" or ""Titanic."" Movies like ""Pleasantville"" which challenge the audience and force them to think are very rare, and should be treasured by the discerning filmgoer.",Pleasantville
256,alden1010,My goodness...,7,15 December 2002,"Pleasantville is morally reprehensible and builds its theme around false dichotomies.  They create a world in which abstinence is bland and promiscuity is exciting.  Maybe this is the way some or most people feel these days.  Some people, however, feel that traditional morality isn't diametrically opposed to variety, love, and passion.  This movie tries to make conservatives into an unruly mob; it is truly offensive.  Men are stereotyped to a negative extreme--well, all but one.  The one man who isn't wicked sleeps with another man's wife.  This movie is post-modern to an evil extreme and I wince every time I think of it.  But this is where our culture is going.  But what can ya do, right?  Just love 'em.",Pleasantville
257,MystiqueStorm,Makes an excellent point,7,7 December 2002,"Well thought out, with a strong cast, Pleasantville, is a classic story about how life is not as simple or as complicated as we think. It shows us that having the ""right"" car, or living in the ""right"" neighborhood, or having the ""right"" job is not what makes life great. You're life doesn't get made by being perfect, it gets made by being lived.",Pleasantville
258,Aussiesmurf,Interesting concept but flawed execution,7,10 October 2002,"Pleasantville is a fabulous idea that tries to cram a heck of a lot of high concept into its running time.Modern teenagers are transported by a convenient remote control into an apparent utopia within the small town setting of a 1950s television show.Fairly innocent conflicts regarding 'geography' and sexual mores give way to a more serious agenda concerning small-minded prejudice, bigotry and the value of individualism.  There is much use of symbolism, particularly the gradual depiction of characters and objects in colour rather than black and white.The acting is of a high quality, with seasoned performers such as Joan Allen, Jeff Daniels and William Macy providing a solid background to (relative) newcomers Tobey Maguire and Reese Witherspoon.However, some of the messages and symbolism is alternatively muddled (the timing of the transformations to colour) and heavy-handed (the signs that start to spring up saying 'no coloureds'.Having said that, there is a lot to like about 'Pleasantville', even if the loftiness of its ambitions is only partially met by its success.Worth a look.",Pleasantville
259,solo-11,"Original, but drags",7,25 April 1999,"The ideas and themes in this movie are very original, like those of Truman Show. Getting in touch with inner feelings would bring out the ""colour"" or change in appearance; people should not be afraid to change; change may disrupt proceedings as well as bring substance and imagination to life. The film touches on racism too.Despite the interesting themes, the film tends to drag. People changing to colour are mostly predictable, except that of Mary-Sue and Bud. The overall length is too long. The story would have been told more effectively in a shorter period of time.The film lacks impact, but it can set you thinking if you concentrate and take note of which things/people change colour first, and the reason for it. Pay attention to the things in the burger shop.",Pleasantville
260,Dale65,Another astonishing DVD from New Line,9,4 May 1999,"Well, the New Line Platinum series is continuing to grow, and this is an immaculate addition.  I enjoyed ""Pleasantville"" when it was in theatres, but seeing it again in this first-rate transfer was just incredible. ""Pleasantville"" is a really smart movie, and I'm not one to particularly enjoy fables (I loathed Benigni's ""Life is Beautiful"" and I thought ""Ever After"" was only mildly amusing).  Gary Ross, along with being a great writer (the disc indicates he has written presidential addresses) is a great visual storyteller.  The film is a work of art, equal to those in art book Tobey Maguire's ""Bud"" gives to Jeff Daniels.The scene in which Bud takes Margaret to Lover's lane is one of the most striking, and the most impressive balance of black and white and color in the film.  Also, Margaret herself, as played by the beautiful Marley Shelton (the only reason I can think to sit through ""Trojan War"" and ""Never Been Kissed"") is a work of art herself.  Those eyes.  That neck.  Those teeth...Anyway, if you're a DVD buff, you'll love also the inclusion of Fiona Apple's video ""Across the Universe"" directed by Paul Thomas Anderson of ""Boogie Nights"".  The ""Pleasantville"" package also includes an edifying commentary track by Gary Ross, and a second commentary by seasoned score composer George S. Clinton.  There are also featurettes on art design, special effects work, and the complete screenplay which you can print on your PC.  Keep up the excellent work New Line, we really appreciate it. May others learn from you.",Pleasantville
261,Ferrick,Visually sweet to cover the overall blandness,6,19 April 1999,"It is interesting to read and hear reviews of this film.  It is either loved or hated, it seems.  I recommend seeing it for the visual aspect, to see great effects.  Otherwise, the story seems to go from deep thoughts to over the top preaching.  I almost feel that it would have been better as a short that raises a bunch of questions without answering any of them instead of a full length feature that answers some questions that don't seem important while ignoring obvious flaws. The acting is above average, for the most part and there are some funny moments but I just felt unfulfilled by this movie.  Some movies do well to leave us with questions to ponder, but not when they make us question the use of the movie.",Pleasantville
262,Andy C-2,Could have been great.,8,2 January 2002,"This film is quite thought provoking and entertaining at the same time -and in a lot of ways is like THE TRUMAN SHOW (which Jim Carey spoils). In the main way, of been a imaginative and interesting idea not pulled off on screen. Pleasantville, at points, brings across a range of interesting social and political issues - by displaying a modern day brother and sister in a 'perfect' and 'plesant' 50's TV show environment which gradually gets changed towards a more modern day environment. Unfornuately the fairy-tail style and the more adult base themes doesn't mix brilliantly and subsquently the film suffers a bit of a identify crisis in relation to its target audience. Its a shame, because its refreshing to see a film with some interesting ideas and bit of imagination compared to general run-of-the-mill box office hits. This could have been used to make a minor-classic - but instead is a above average film - if not hugely more. And leaves little desire to rush to watch it again.",Pleasantville
263,MustacheUmbrella,"""For every season turn ,turn ,turn""",9,9 February 2001,"This movie should have won first prize at the box office. Remember this movie, and once seen through the eyes of an average intelligent human being, you wont forget how there is hope for the American culture ""A gentle comedy yet also a drama. I must say that this movie will enhance the audience and will open people up if they are willing to take the time and go deep into the valley of their mind. Pleasantville will change you, I am not joking!The movie makes an entrance at poking fun of those old sitcoms as spoofs like ""Leave it to beaver"" ""Father Knows Best"" The Andy Griffith, ""Dick Van Dyke"" but ends up becoming one perfect political satire statement.This is a follow up of the book ""Fahrenheit 451"" as well as ""The Truman Show"" but with a different twist. All the people in Pleasantville, as well as us (The audience member) , are though how we must live through change! At first, pleasantville is seen as this quiet little ""perfect"" simple minded community, where ""Everything is good with the world"" but then we learn that even though everyone is happy in Pleasantville, inside they are actually miserable. And we all learn quick that the only disturbance in Pleasantville is cats getting stuck in trees! There are no opportunities in Pleasantville, without this, progression cease to exist, without progression, there are no challenges, without challenges, there are no problems. No problems, no in dependency = no means to live. So really the people are dead in Pleasantville and live in this very boring circle where they do the same things over and over again. Really, they're living a quiet communism.But David and Jennifer (the characters who were zapped into their TV sets who end up in Pleasantville ) unknowingly are about to change this world for the better. They share to the world of Pleasantville their culture from the 1990's, and from there progression took place. People then had sex for the first time, basketball shots were missed, the ended up losing their first basketball game ever, and it later brought a bit of color to the town and opportunity. Yes, riots broke out, but they then learned how to defend themselves. So therefore, this movie was also about being afraid of change and how to deal and become accustom to it.We now assume to live in a very fast paced world, filled with rudeness, independently and danger. We assume that the ""Old days"" were ""BETTER"" But they are not. Learn that something just wasn't right. Somehow there is an attachment and we learn from the townspeople of Pleasantville of how to be a little more modest and polite, and the pleasantville residents learn to be a little more assertive and independent. Let our boundaries expand!9.2/10 A-",Pleasantville
264,aysx87,Heavyhanded,6,8 November 2011,"The potential was there--the actors were great (esp Macguire as nerd and a young, fat Reese Witherspoon and the puppyish Daniels), the 50s atmosphere seemed to set everything up for nostalgia and irony, and the premise of 90s children bringing color and passion in a 50s television show seemed like a great story. Unfortunately, the heavyhanded message detracted from the experience. The worst signs were the over-dramatic courtroom monologue adding nothing particularly original (""what's different is inside us""), the extremely heavy racial and religious allegory (girlfriend offering an apple? things that are off-limits to ""colored"" people? mccarthy-era fahrenheit 451-style book burning??), the overplayed color metaphor (the first few times were great, having it last to the end of the story dragged). It begins to seem a bit dumb and heavy...and its message is ridiculously left-leaning. A housewife, and some high school kids, find passion after sex (and masturbation, after which a tree goes up in the obvious flames), with no regard to teenage pregnancy, stds, etc. A bored schoolgirl finds passion after reading D. H. Lawrence. Leaving one's husband and starting extramarital affairs is given a thumbs up (and never resolved afterward.) Someone paints a housewife nude on a wall and the attack on it is made out to be some kind of anti-art, anti-passion mccarthyism crusade. In the end, the hero exhorts the audience to find their true feelings and passions, including anger. The town turns colorful. Boring, and biased, and an obvious, heavyhanded story.",Pleasantville
265,d13,Beautiful Crap,2,9 November 1998,"This is a great movie to watch with the sound all the way down.  The visual effects are stunning and it's very pleasant to watch as long as no one's talking.  Don Knotts is entertaining but, otherwise, this is a grotesquely shallow movie with absolutely none of the redeeming social value that it obviously is trying to find.",Pleasantville
266,triple-x,spot-on,7,29 March 1999,"Pleasant is the word for it: amiable, entertaining, likable, blissfully reassuring, lovely to look at, and ultimately toothless.  I give it a 7 (marked down from an 8 for Fiona Apple's soporific trashing of Lennon's ""Across the Universe"" over the end credits)",Pleasantville
267,TheAgent,Movies that shake their finger at you are suspect,5,2 February 2000,"The film goes overboard in its disdain for the images portrayed on television during the 50's. While we can all laugh at the cheesiness of ""Leave it to Beaver"" and its 'golly gee whiz' look and feel, I don't feel that such shows deserve the scorn Pleasantville heaps upon them. In fact many shows from that era have a loyal following and continue to appear on rerun channels. Thank goodness the bimbo Mary Sue Parker was able to go to bed with everyone and save Pleasantville from its goody-goody nature. Since no one ever did any hanky-panky in the 50s, it was fascinating to envision what that would have been like. The only redeeming moment for her was her change of attitude, her realization that this kind of life went nowhere.
The notion that movies or television have an obligation to address every one of society's ills is as narrow minded as many of the antagonist characters in Pleasantville. While there are lots of good films that do that, many successful films do not. Pleasantville exaggerated the flaws of its characters to the point of being overly unrealistic. The film sure has an awfully arrogant premise. It's as if the film is saying ""Look how enlightened we '90s people are and how politically and culturally deprived you '50s people are."" The people in the 2030's are going to say the same things about the people of today. What else is new?Pleasantville's message is nothing new. To be culturally enlightened you have to read ""Catcher in the Rye"" and like nude paintings and sculptures. Only 10 million literature professors have said the same thing.When I saw the trailers about Pleasantville, I thought it was going to be a satirical look at the cheesiness of 1950s entertainment. This is an approach that could have been quite successful. I was looking forward to seeing this instead of being lectured for two hours.",Pleasantville
268,ChainsawDaveandMisterShoop,Original and thought provoking,9,22 May 2003,"A little gem. Works as a great drama, and also as musings on life, segregation, art, racism, philosophy, teenage behavior etc... basically anything you want. The sharp directing and inventive use of color frame a greatly written film with a lot of appeal, and strong performances.Hollywood should actively make more films like Pleasantville.",Pleasantville
269,shagya49,Pleasantville,7,7 January 2006,"The only thing I didn't like about this film is the idea that the nineteen fifties were some period of eternal virginity. Having lived through that decade I can tell you that one singular and notable difference had to do with privacy not abstinence. People simply didn't talk about personal "" stuff "" on daytime talk shows. Brutality existed just as it does now but in some ways was less democratic and less ""psychologized"". The issue of colour returning to the characters centres about their discovery of emotion not (just) sexual mechanics. David realizes that the retro world which he enters as an escape from his pathetic family is just not that wonderful. They have problems just as we do and the solutions are the same: honesty, fairmindedness, intellectual curiosity and most importantly showing courage in the face of evil. I give Pleasantville a seven.",Pleasantville

What a superb actress!Pleasantville is a beautifully designed and directed film which in some ways is like the flip side and mirror image of The Truman Show all at the same time. Though I think it gets somewhat heavy-handed in its message and could use a bit of cutting, it is still one of the best films in a long while! Extremely creative and most emphatically worth seeing.",Pleasantville
271,lucky-16,Good actors. Average script. Way too much politics.,4,5 February 1999,"This movie is no truman show. The main characters are ""superman"" and ""superwoman"" (gotta be politically correct huh) who save the city which doesn't think in the ""right"" way. If this movie was filmed in 50s, these would be two white guys who ""save"" a 30s city which treats blacks in the fair way. Way too much politics and brainwashing in this movie. 4/10 (all four points are for actor performance).",Pleasantville
272,lucky-16,Not worth watching,4,23 June 2000,"There are going to be a line of reviews before and after mine, so I will excuse myself from repeating the storyline and characters (or, should I say, lack of storyline and character originality). The only worthy thing in this movie is cinematography -- the movie beautifully incorporates black'n'white with color pictures. However, cinematography in great movies like Braveheart beat this one by a mile. Unless you deeply care how a colored character will look into a black-n-white movie, spend your time and money somewhere else.Rating: 4/10, I saw it on an airplane, it beats watching through the airplane window by a narrow margin.",Pleasantville
273,Curly-10,A phenomenal film,10,4 April 1999,"Pleasantville is an extraordinary film, one that stirs up as many emotions in the viewer as those being felt by the characters.  I agree with other people who frowned at some of the immorality in the movie, but I don't agree with some of the comments which said that people in the movie only turned color when they were ""sinning.""  They turned color when they were experiencing deep feelings for the first time.  When did Mary Sue/Jen turn color?  When she had delved into a book for the first time.  When did Bud/David turn color?  When he stood up for someone that he cared about. Then there is the bathtub scene.  Maybe I'm way off, but I don't think that Betty actually ""you-know-what.""  I think that her oohing and aahing is supposed to make us think that she is before we realize that she is really oohing and aahing at the colors she is seeing.  It is all a question of interpretation and point of view, as is everything in the movie.  It is about our most human feelings and how we choose to address them.  Do we deny our feelings and live robotic, ignorant lives or do we acknowledge our feelings and nurture them?  These are questions that all of us must ask ourselves. If you haven't thought about these things before, this film will bring those questions to the surface and make you put your own life under the microscope.  It is truly a marvel that draws you in as much as the two 90's teenagers.",Pleasantville
274,AndyS-4,disappointing,5,22 November 1998,"I thought the movie was slow, predictable and simplistic.  The only interesting part had to do with the conflict between the greys and the coloreds.  It had obvious parallels with racial and ethnic strife worldwide. Except the solution reached in the movie has no relevance to those real world problems.",Pleasantville
275,MyOwnNarnia,Wonderful!!!,10,19 June 2003,"Anyone who doesn't like this movie must have something wrong with him or her, or at least have nothing artistic inside of them at all.Pleasantville is an enduring and priceless movie that shows the true side of people and the way that people treat each other, it displays love, jealousy, friendship, intelligence, stupidity, fear of change and total innocence (along with other emotions)... it is quite simply, one of the best movies I have ever seen and is on my top ten favorites list. Great acting, laughs, tears, humility.... LIFE.See this movie, you won't regret it!9.9 out of 10",Pleasantville
276,kevin6527,Hail to Joan Allen,8,10 November 2000,"Of all the actors in this interesting film, Joan Allen certainly is the most impressive one. Her deep emotions being trapped in the world of black and white totally turn around in a very subtle way. And this subtle star quality certainly makes Joan Allen a great actress specializing in difficult roles like a lonely housewife trapped in the routines of life. I was deeply moved by her convincing acting in this film.",Pleasantville
277,tsmiljan,The Beauty of Color,10,27 April 2007,"Although many reviewers have commented on the gradual switch from black and white to color as the film progresses, and although the themes of freedom and bigotry have been well documented in the reviews, I wanted to add an extra comment on the subject of color.One of the most striking moments in the entire movie is when Jeff Daniels opens the art book and thumbs through it. The movie audience, having spent some time like the characters seeing everything in black and white, can share with him the experience of seeing the paintings in their full color for the first time. We have all seen the famous paintings he looks at in the book many times, but have we ever seen them with such fresh eyes? The colors, both subtle in the Old Masters and bold in the modern works, virtually jump off the pages.And continuing in this vein, when Daniels wipes Joan Allen's face with his napkin and reveals her true and vibrant skin color, it looks exactly as though he is ""painting"" her face with his strokes. This was truly a transcendent moment for me, and I never tire of seeing this scene in multiple repeated viewings.See this movie if only for the renewed appreciation of beautiful things.",Pleasantville

I'm fond of Tobey Maguire and Reese Witherspoon and I believe this is some of their better work. This movie has good acting, characters, and story.However, they are a few problems with it. The fantasy world of pleasantville doesn't establish clear rules. There were some scenes I wanted to see; such as Maguire's character telling his tv parents where he's really from. It's hinted at, but glossed over quickly. I also wanted to see what the new Pleasantville looked like from the 90s perspective. Was it always in color? Did Reese Witherspoon never exist to her parents in the changed timeline? These unanswered questions don't detract from an otherwise solid watch.",Pleasantville
279,Ivanhoe,Pleasantville is a truly enjoyable film... especially if you understand it.,8,31 October 1998,"I have been reading several reviews on Pleasantville and I find it disturbing that some of the reviewers didn't understand it, and therefore didn't like it.In one such review, the writer says that he really wanted to love the film. But he gets it all wrong. He says that the reason he didn't like the movie was because of a major inconsistency: if emotion is what's changing things' colors, why do the outraged conservatives, led by Big Bob (Walsh), remain in black and white?The answer is simple. Emotion is not what is colorizing Pleasantville. It's one's acceptance of change. With that in mind, this reviewer may want to watch the movie a second time to see what I mean. All the people in Pleasantville, Bud and Mary Sue (Maguire and Witherspoon) included, turn colors when they realize that they want things to change. Even inanimate objects begin to change colors as if they were accepting what the humans around them were doing. In that way, the script and the effects remained very consistent.What I thought was going to be a fun lampoon of 50's sitcoms turned out to be a truly moving fun lampoon of 50's sitcoms. And Don Knotts really freaked me out. Okay, so some of the dialogue was a bit cheesy, but ya gotta overlook that stuff sometimes. Pleasantville is one of the best movies I've seen so far in 1998, with great special effects and production design, zestful writing and direction, and masterful acting by all performers. I'm pleased that J. T. Walsh's final performance was a memorable one.",Pleasantville
280,AGman,What a pleasant movie!,9,24 October 1998,"This movie was remarkable. I thought that the way the cinematography and color was used was magnificent. This movie steals scenes right out of other movies (Titanic, Shawshank Redemption, Fahrenheit 451, To Kill A Mockingbird, and Citizen Kane, just to name a few) yet it still creates its own identity. I also loved Don Knotts as the TV Repairman. Watch for the scene when Bud runs into the firehouse. This should be nominated for Best Picture.",Pleasantville

Great casting, really wonderful special effects, funny, smack dab accurate to the period, surprisingly moving, and generally keen.

Absolutely recommended.",Pleasantville
282,derekh,"Visually stunning, but flawed.",6,28 March 1999,"It's a great and original idea, and it's a visual masterpiece.  But ""Pleasantville"" didn't quite live up to what I thought its potential was. The plot itself seems rather aimless.  By that, I mean that it touches on a few themes here and there such as racism and how change can polarize a community, but it never really does anything with them.  You never get any sense of why you should really care what's going to happen next from anything other than a visual point of view.  There are also some rather large and obvious plot holes, such as how Jennifer's disappearance is going to be explained to her mother.  Pleasantville was written, produced and directed by the same person.  Sometimes, such a singular vision can prevent a movie from being watered down; other times, it can cause a movie to not reach its potential.  In this case, it seems the latter has happened.  The performances are all solid, but the film just seems to me like it needed a story editor to go through it a few times and tighten it up.  I gave it a 7 for good performances, original concept, and technical excellence, but it could have gotten a higher rating if it had been tighter.",Pleasantville
283,TLB73737,"Starts well, good conceptual ideal, but poor focus, empty message",1,17 January 2000,"This movie starts off well.  It quickly gets you into the idea that these two teenagers will experience contrasting experiences in two different realities.But once we understand the vehicle of the message, we quickly learn that the writer does not know what he wants to communicate to the audience.  Others on IMDB have come away with the message that they wanted to see.  However, if one is to closely examine the message that the writer is trying to dish out, you will easily see that he fails miserably.It is trying to say that we must be true to ourselves, follow our own path and not conform.However, the message (very clearly at the end of the film) is that we have no control over our lower inclinations and that to not let them out is to be miserable.  What folly!The lack of self-restraint is no path to happiness.  Neither is adultery, contrary to final third of the film.  The duplicity and hypocrisy of the writer's message will be clear to anyone who chooses to closely examine this film.There were, however, some fine performances from several of the actors. The acting is NOT the problem with this film.  It is the writing and direction. (Done by the same person).",Pleasantville

In a year full of war, disaster, and Shakespearean films, this movie put a new twist on the fifties flashback movies.  Tobey Maguire and Reese Witherspoon are two of the most under-appreciated teen actors of this generation.  They may still be young, but most of the parts that they play are very mature when compared to the teen bop movies that are coming out right now.  Joan Allen is still one of the most versatile actresses in Hollywood today.  William H. Macy always plays small roles that are played to perfection.  I must say that this cast probably couldn't have been chosen any better.

286,phantom1515,A wild ride that provokes thought...,10,29 June 2001,"Pleasantville is one of the best and most unique films of recent years. It's plot is simple on the outside (brother and sister are transported back to 50's sitcom and try to come back), yet upon further examination this film is actually a powerful social commentary on racisim and discrimination. David and Jennifer are two siblings from 1990's America. Their mother is on her way to visit her boyfriend (who is 10 years younger then she is), and in school all they seem to hear about is how the world is being destroyed. While Jennifer is pretty and popular, David is an outcast who seems to be obsessed with an old sitcom called Pleasentville. When one night the two of them are transported back into this sitcom they begin a journey to understand the concept of change. Along the way the people that experience change, become colorized. This begins a provoking and uplifting film about the power of individualisim, and the evil of racisim.When you decide to watch this film take time to notice the small things that make this movie worth watching multiple times.",Pleasantville

Finally I decided that perhaps it was going somewhere, and it would be interesting to see where it was going. Well, it went nowhere. I'll admit, it was very funny at some points. The naivety of the people could be very funny.The actors were good. I've become a fan of Tobey Maguire even though I haven't liked either of the movies I've seen him in.Nevertheless, this movie made no sense. Even if you call it a fairytale, fairytales live by rules, too. If there were no rules in a fairytale there would be no conflict because the hero would just think the dragon defeated. All worlds need rules. I can be led into accepting, for the sake of the story, that two kids can be sucked into the TV world. This is acceptable for the fairytale. But in the end, a rule was broken. It made no sense. I kept repeating, ""they can't do that!"" They didn't explain how it could be done, or what the results were--the movie just ended. They broke a rule and didn't explain it to make it believable.I was bored throughout the movie. The ending just made me extremely annoyed.",Pleasantville

In that respect, it is not dissimilar to ""Final Destination"" or ""Cube"".I'm not saying that it is not a good film. It is. But let's just say that the ending left a little to be desired.It is a very very original idea...it starts off so promising. The acting is faultless, the transition to black and white is very clever, the script is very witty. I think that where it goes wrong is that it tries just a little too hard to be intelligent. But it doesn't need to...that comes across naturally, and instead of being able to sit back and enjoy it as the delightful gem that it is, you spend too long trying to analyse the confusing subtle undertones.And whilst it endeavours to prove itself as a serious piece of cinematography, it forgets small, but vital plot details, which, for a viewer who must have every last detail tied up and successfully concluded, proves incredibly frustrating viewing.",Pleasantville

The characters are very likable, because they're willing to go where they haven't gone before. Joan Allen delivers a performance that had me tearing up.

290,honey-8,Liked it but didn't love it,8,1 November 1998,Pleasantville was an interesting concept and turned out to be a better film than I originally thought.  The only time I thought it went a bit too far was when the writer tried to recreate the whole court scene in To Kill a Mockingbird and also when they tried to do the whole black and white v. colored a la how it was in fifties society.  It was still a pretty good film and I would definitely recommend it to people.  The actors did an excellent job and Paul Walker is definitely a cutie!,Pleasantville
291,honey-8,Pretty good film,8,1 November 1998,"I like Pleasantville but I didn't absolutely love it.The whole idea of the film was an interesting concept that was both original and creative.  The cinematography for some of the scenes was absolutely incredible and beautiful (i.e. the scene where David/Bud and the girl who likes him are driving to the teen make-out point and the pink petals are flying everywhere).  I loved the music (After Five, the re-make by Fiona Apple of a Beatles song) and I will probably buy the soundtrack.  The acting was suprisingly good from Tobey Maguire (even though at times I thought it was a bit much and I liked his acting in The Ice Storm much better than in this film) and Reese Witherspoon.  Joan Allen and William H. Macy gave excellent performances, of course.  A face that I remembered because of his looks was Paul Walker, a very handsome man.It's definitely a film that I would recommend people to go see but I wouldn't say it's one of the best movies of the year.  What made me not think it was not the one of the best films of the year was because the writers attempted to make a statement with the film about the thoughts of society that really existed in Pleasantville's timeframe (the 50s).  It was a little too melodramatic for me and the film began to lose me from there. I really didn't like the ending; it really lost me.  The ending was like the perfect endings of the Pleasantville episodes-definitely did not like that.Go see it if you haven't because it deserves a look.",Pleasantville

293,kon-tiki-2,Yawn... or Yuck (both apply),1,9 May 1999,"One of the most disappointing films I've rented recently.  After reading all the glowing reviews, I had expected something at least as fun as the first ""Back to the Future"" movie, but boy, was I ever let down.  First of all, this movie doesn't know what it's even about.  There doesn't seem to be any sort of viable conflict to justify anything that goes on.  The story changes direction several times, but never comes together to add up to anything. The main theme appears to be that the corrupt and decadent 1990's culture is a vast improvement on the boring and innocent 1950's that we've seen depicted in so many old television shows.  What kind of message is that? That aside, this movie is far less entertaining than those same old programs that it makes fun of. The dialog is tedious, the acting shaky, the musical score forgettable, and the visual effects passe.  We've all seen the TV commercials where everything is black and white and yet one person is in color.  That's what this whole movie is based on.  The whole story and all the hub-bub is built around exploiting this one simple visual effect, which gets old really fast.  If you're thinking about renting this loser, forget all the Hollywood hype and save yourself a few yawns: put it back on the shelf and find something better.  It won't be hard.",Pleasantville

296,busy-boy,"#1 on my list of ""movies I would see again.""",10,28 September 2006,"*** SPOILER WARNING *** On the surface, ""Pleasantville"" seems like a fun, sci-fi genre, time machine regression into the past, much like ""Back to the Future"". Not even halfway through a first viewing though, you will feel compelled to rewind (metaphorically in DVD world) and rewatch the film from the beginning, lest you missed something important.Black and white TV sitcoms stand as a symbol of America's recent, modern past. They represent the last age of innocence, just prior to the assassination of President Kennedy, which history books will one day regard as the seminal event that set into motion a new age of disenchantment. Yet, under that veneer of innocence seethed a pervasive atmosphere of racial and religious hatred, political fear, intimidation and the lingering grip of fascism. The veneer was there just to help people escape.""Pleasantville"" revisits that nice world and uncovers it's ignorance and didacticism. That's not so nice. The process never is. But it also uncovers that world's beauty and restores its peoples faith and sense of self determination, as well as their pigment. The film so adroitly handles the issues of racism that one commenter here thought that the issue was entirely missed, merely because a black person was not included. The point missed is that our traditional concepts of what it means to be ""colored"", physically and by happenstance of birth, are not necessarily valid. Merely being the ""they"" in a ""we/they"" relationship is sufficient to feel the oppression.The change of each character from monochrome to color occurs when the individual grows, accepts knowledge and becomes self-aware. In this marvelous allegory, to be colored is to be whole.",Pleasantville
297,magnoliaX82,Pleasantville (1998) [Directed by Gary Ross],10,9 December 2002,"To put it simply, Pleasantville is one of the most intelligent films I've ever seen... and trust me, I've seen a lot! At first glance it might be confused for another cliched teen comedy (which is what irritated me so much about the tag-line, ""From the Co-Creator of Big and Dave!""), but it is an entirely different story. The story itself is as follows: two bickering siblings are mystically transported into an old TV show named ""Pleasantville,"" which follows in the tradition of ""Leave it to Beaver"" and ""I Love Lucy"" as being a virtually flawless world where couples sleep in separate beds and children use the word ""swell."" Suspend all suspicious disbelief for a moment, however, and try to see beyond the surface: once the film picks up it's pace, it becomes less of a fish-out-of-water comedy, and more of an examination on the issues and imperfections of life. In fact, it is one of the few movies that dares to examine every aspect of life -- INCLUDING political correctness -- without being politically correct itself. What I mean by this is that prejudice, sexuality, love, and humanity are for once portrayed as they really are, and not as society forces us to view them. This alone should have garnered it an R rating in my opinion, which would have aimed it at more mature audiences and convinced the Academy to take it more seriously. But the most intelligent thing about Pleasantville is that it refuses to impose a certain belief on the audience. It never hesitates at questioning the laws of society, but it also never attempts to answer them. Instead, it forces us to simply look at them from a different perspective, which is the smartest thing any movie could ever do... though very few have actually done. The BEST thing about Pleasantville, however, is the cinematography. In all honesty, it is the finest filming I have EVER seen. And it's not just the brilliant combination of color and black and white, it's the sheer focus of the picture as well: each frame we watch is carefully balanced, making the film both an intellectual AND visual pleasure. Other highlights of the film are the acting (Joan Allen at her very best, William H. Macy playing a character slightly resemblant of his role in Fargo, and Jeff Daniels actually doing something GOOD), the soundtrack (which earned yet another Academy nomination for Randy Newman), and the editing (if you watch carefully, there are very brief ""blurs"" in between each major cut, as there would be in any old TV program). While I am disappointed that so few people loved this film as much as I did, I wouldn't have it any other way: it is one of the few independents that hasn't gone mainstream or been spoiled by public hype.Grade: A",Pleasantville

299,SKeller64,Fantastic!,10,1 November 1998,"Much like one of my other favorite films of the year (The Truman Show), Pleasantville is a funny movie based around TV with a very strong message about society.  Unlike Truman, it's not quite as subtle with the message, but that's not a bad thing.  The movie is hilarious at times, though it's not quite a comedy.  The imagery (the use of color contrasted with the black and white) is very neat, and works incredibly well for the film.  Highly recommended.",Pleasantville

I mean, it had all the elements of a great movie:great acting, original idea, humorous at times, and great special effects.  But I just thought it had way too many mistakes that could have easily been noticed by the filmmakers.  Here's a list of some of them:how did the people now what color was before they started seeing it?...How did the people know what rain was before they started seeing it?...Why did the earth around the people slowly change color with them?...How did David get back to his home without that old tv repairman?...Another thing that kind of made me think less of this film was the typical courtroom ending with the whole typical thing happening, which is, of course, that everyone stops hating the accused and they all cheer and stuff.  This is what made me hate Patch Adams so much...but still, I have to admit, a lot of stuff from this movie, especially the middle, was pretty good, it just turned out to be an unoriginal(and stupid) second half to an original and weird beginning.

Rather than entertain, this movie chooses to present moronic stereotyped characters instead of anyone with any type of accountability.  There are a number of places where you will find it very hard not to laugh out loud at the movie's condescending nature.  The first 30 minutes is actually somewhat interesting but the movie falls apart fast and goes nowhere, and worst of all, it drags on.  Nice video by Fionna Apple on the dvd, though.",Pleasantville
302,MisterCellophane,Buried treasure.,10,11 December 2006,"**Spoilers throughout**Unfairly eclipsed by the excellent The Truman Show, and easily dismissed as a facile ""sucked into the TV"" comedy, Pleasantville is truly an under-appreciated classic.Strong performances and writing set it apart from films like the later Stay Tuned, with Tobey Maguire and Reese Witherspoon displaying acting capabilities that transcend their youth. The standout in this excellent ensemble has to be Joan Allen, whose remarkably studied performance is a masterclass in character development, as her Betty slowly steps free of repression and blossoms into a woman of sensuous, simple beauty and independence. Jeff Daniels is charming too as Bill, the bow-tied soda store owner who discovers passions within. Coming to terms with one's inner passion isn't an easy process, we discover, as the town breaks apart into paranoia and fear, dangerously teetering on the brink of a kind of apartheid until even the staunchest black-and-white citizen realises that change is inevitable and that the unPleasant waits within. It is precisely this thread of tension that elevates Pleasantville over the level of easy comedy, though there are a good number of affectionate laughs here.The beauty of Pleasantville is the way in which the film so easily and comfortably finds its stride and, like Groundhog Day, uses every last scrap of its unapologetically high concept to the maximum. The real coup de cinema is that the modern-day kids don't learn old-fashioned values as much as the citizens of Pleasantville learn from David and Jennifer how wonderful sexual and cultural freedom can be. This isn't just a fish-out-of-water comedy - the arrival of the kids disturbs the very fundament of Pleasantville. The way in which the seemingly happy yet horribly repressed town is slowly exposed to the freedoms of modern life is thrilling to watch - symbolised with such great clarity initially by the use of colour and other ""unPleasant"" things like lightning, rain and the joyous eruption of a tree into orange and yellow flames upon Betty's first orgasm. Another great achievement here is that the audience really gets a sense of how powerfully such changes impact upon the community - the first glimpse of a red rose is framed with such intensity that we ourselves are disturbed - uncertain as to whether we should be thrilled or frightened.",Pleasantville
303,cleu_fergie,"Different, but simply perfect.",9,21 August 2012,"Every so often do you come across a film that speaks of someone who stands up to 'the man', and rallies everyone to be bold. Every so often is there a film that screams the banal message, 'safety is overrated'. This ideology has been repeated so many times in numerous films (though it may fall upon deaf ears), that the message behind it all has become hollowed out. Truth be told, I've gotten bored with this sort of movie.Then comes Pleasantville, the movie that executes this idea so differently, it's simply perfect.Pleasantville is a make-believe town in the movie that is the generic stereotype of good ol' 1950s America; everything's swell, simple, and there was no such thing as no-strings- attached sex. It was a mundane black and white world with no hiccups or atrocities. Pleasantville was, well, pleasant. Then, everything changed when a pair of siblings (Tobey Maguire and Reese Witherspoon) arrived. Trapped in time, the two siblings are overwhelmed by oddities like loving parents, old-fashioned values, and a plethora of innocence. They soon learn to join this 'backwards' society, bringing colour to this small town. As the naiveté fades, the teens begin to wonder if their 'modern' perceptions are really the better option. I loved this movie, to say the least. The fact that this movie was set in a 1950s sitcom made the colour versus black and white contrast that much starker. I guess you could blame my inner Literature student for saying this, but this metaphor used made the movie a great deal more enjoyable, and the message so much sharper. The characters changed. They tried new things. They got more intrepid and spontaneous. People painted and had sex, wives no longer made dinner for their husbands, and the world was a technicolour wonderland. As the characters became more willing to try new things and take risks, they become people, and colour trickles into their black and white world. The characters literally had more colour in them as the movie went on. How is one to live passionately if they cling on to good old fashioned values, innocence or caution anyway, right? The concept used in this movie is brilliant. It puts its message across so effectively. Pleasantville is a movie that will make people sit up and go, 'Hey, I get the message. It makes sense.' The concept is so startlingly simple, but it's the most ingenious one I've seen. It grabs the audience's attention and entertains us no end. The setting, characters and plot are all woven together so fittingly. The development of the cardboard cut-out characters to real people, the demolition of awful stereotypes, and the fantastic screenplay make this movie worth your time.Pleasantville is more than pleasant, it is remarkable.",Pleasantville
304,Willieo,Wolf in sheep's clothing...,1,22 April 1999,"I wanted to see Pleasantville because it looked like a movie that had some neat visual effects and poked some harmless fun at a more docile time from America's past.What I saw was a movie which went from subtle hints that morality stinks to blatant signs that any moral person has absolutely no right to live.I'm not going to go into all the issues addressed (way too many in one movie...), but basically, if you had/have morals, you were/are a boring person with a closed mind.  To truly see things as they were/are, you had/have to throw away everything you believed/believe in and just do something outrageous and/or against the norm.The insidious thing was that by the end of the movie, the 'moral' people were the ones behaving the way immoral people act in real life, and vice versa.  I know 'moral' can be subjective, but this movie is just one more example of making 'good' people look like freaks by adjusting the norm to fit Hollywood's ideals.",Pleasantville

However, 50's television was nothing like the real life of the time, and most people knew that, and laughed at the bland, whitewashed version television insisted on showing. Unfortunately, ""Pleasantville"" implies that this was the way people lived and thought then, thereby setting up a series of straw men, and shooting them down.  Teenagers didn't have sex, there weren't pregnancies and STDs, the pointy bras weren't noticed?  Come on!   The only things that have changed are that now such things are spoken of openly, and we don't punish behavior and consequences as cruelly as we did then.If you want to know what the past was like, there are better sources than old television programs.",Pleasantville

As if anyone really believed that anyway.   The movie is full of all kinds of preachiness that is too obvious and heavy handed.  Sure, a world such as depicted in Pleasantville would have problems but I know of no-one who thinks of that world as an ideal. This movie got real old and boring real fast.",Pleasantville

I loved the score by Randy Newman.  I liked all of the characters (and the actors portraying them).My major problem with the film was with the disjointed script.  I don't believe it was focused well, and I don't believe it was written with a clear vision of what it wanted to convey.  There were many holes.  I felt no emotion and only mildly chuckled two or three times.  I wanted something to make me FEEL something -- essentially to bring ""color"" into my life.  For the first hour, I was under the impression that it was sex which gave the characters their ""color."" Then I thought maybe it was passion, but by the end of the film I was still unsure.  I liked the references to art and literature and music giving life its color.  And while I am certainly no prude, I think sex was overemphasized, and I was especially disappointed with the idea that Mom's bathtub masturbation scene was what brought ""color"" to her life. Oh how I wish that was all it took to achieve ""color"" in one's life.  In that respect, I believe the film stumbled and failed in getting at its intended point -- that  our realization of our own unique place within the universe is what ultimately illuminates us.

Or, rather, a teen-age boy who is clearly the writer's alter ego.Just because adults in the 1950s were not blatant and overt about their sexuality doesn't mean that they weren't sexual beings. It means that they understood the difference between public and private. Just because teens have a difficult time accepting that their parents are sexual beings does not mean that they are not. Just because adults in the 1950s were adults, not neurotic messes, does not mean that they were emotionless. And just because teenagers think that sex is the be-all and end-all of life doesn't mean that it is.In typical adolescent fashion, women are depicted as loving and nurturing and weak, while men are domineering and rigid and authoritarian. What woman wouldn't think of putting make-up on to hide a blemish? She wouldn't need her oh-so-wise son to think of it for her, and certainly wouldn't need him to apply it.What was the point of sending them into the television show? Yes, the t.v. repairman nattered on about something, but what was the real point? The television show isn't real. The characters aren't real, they are played by actors; the location isn't real, it's a studio set. So, what, really, is the point of trying to ""awaken"" them? They'll still be ageless fictional characters. Why try to force them to think beyond the boundaries of their fictional town, when it will remain a studio set? Yes, I understand that it's a metaphor. It's a particularly clumsy, awkward, and ham-handed metaphor.If we are to accept the characters as ""real,"" with lives that are not depicted on screen, then where are those lives? The movie can't have it both ways -- that they are real, but only exist when one of the main characters is around. That sex is unknown, but the town is populated with teens who had to come from somewhere. That the men's bland, placid exteriors cover a seething, hateful exterior, while the women are depressed and unfulfilled -- but they have no emotional life until awakened by their teen-age savior. That there is no world outside the town, but they have food, clothing, utilities, etc. Oh, and how was the town going to deal with the rash of teen pregnancies that were bound to occur? Twilight Zone dealt with similar issues in a similar format and did it so much better and all in 30 minutes. But, then, it was written by adults for adults.",Pleasantville

So many powerful messages within the movie, most of all, how important it is to feel and experience the joys and sorrows of life. Joan Allen's character experiencing true love and passion for the first time. Reese Witherspoon's character finding fulfillment in personal growth. I found one the most important message from the movie is how important it is to embrace who you are, such as being gay, and the power of belief in yourself. To not be afraid of the beauty of being different. Another one of the undertones is color- being 'colored' for example, which certainly fits into the '50's mentality of African Americans.

First off, this movie is stunning, from the makup to the costumes to the cinematography. A visual treat to savour and get lost in, with a perfect musical score to set the tone.Secondly, the acting in it is committed and well rounded. It does this without feeling preachy. I especially love Jeff Daniels performance because it feels so genuine.Third of all, I found this movie so enchanting as a child and it has held it's unique grip on me into my adult years. There has never been anything that feels like a carbon copy of this movie before or since. It radiates the same fairytale, golden age style as ""it's a wonderful life"" while also feeling relevant to its time like ""Cruel intentions,"" and struck a personal chord with me like ""the secret life of Walter Mitty""It's a truly stunning and lasting commentary on a fairly modern life with the spell cast by old TV shows and movies that have an ""everything is perfect"" quality.",Pleasantville

And I was very annoyed to see the film pay homage to ""To Kill A Mockingbird"" in one of it's numerous visual references to great films. ""Pleasantville"" should NEVER be mentioned in the same sentence, no...same book as THAT treasure. The waste of the acting talent in this film is a crying shame.

One scene is particularly chilling, one extremely tender, and others reminded me what a special gift is 'choice'.

316,rkchang,an amusing parody that moves on to commentary,9,12 March 2006,"When I initially walked into this movie, I was expecting nothing more than a parody of many of the 50's sitcoms that we've come to know and love. While the element of parody is still there, I found this movie to provide much more.This movie follows the story of David (Tobey Maguire) and Jennifer (Reese Witherspoon) as they get sucked into the show Pleasantville (which is named after the town the show takes place in). The two are forced to take on the roles of Bud and Mary Sue Parker. David, a massive fan of the show, struggles to maintain the status quo of the nostalgic land that he loves so much. Jennifer, on the other hand, is out to be her own woman, never minding the ramifications that this may have on her new environment. Along the way, the two find themselves pushing against the rigid social homogeneity and the psychological repression that is unmistakeably characteristic of this TV genre. With each push, the town's citizens and the town, itself, find themselves in ambivalence of the newfound color that the two have brought.The use of color is an obvious technical marvel for this film. The contrast of colored environments and characters with their black and white counterparts is amazing, and it's easy to see why this movie earned so many technical accolades. In addition to the technical aspects, the cast is wonderfully assembled. Both Maguire and Witherspoon give some of the best performances of their career. Joan Allen, Willam H. Macy, and Jeff Daniels adeptly play the 50's character stereotype yet also give a smooth transition for their characters' evolution towards their more ""enlightened"" colored selves. Some of the imagery used is both hilarious and insightful, combining some biblical themes with a slightly more modern context.I've re-watched this film several times on DVD, and I never get tired of it. I only wish I could get my hands on the amazing mural used towards the end of the film.",Pleasantville

OK so it has the common baseline of one person trying to fight for what he believes in, against something or someone bigger or more powerful than he is, however with Pleasantville there's a difference. What makes this film individual is how colour is used. As people blossom into what they want to be and show their inner passions they begin to change from black and white into colour. Also the cast list is impressive and each actor lives up to the great standard expected of them. This is especially true for Tobey Maguire, Reese Witherspoon and Joan Allen. I'd give this film 9/10.",Pleasantville

What was wrong wasn't that these people were living according conservative values, but that they didn't really choose those values in the first place!I like the fact that the film was bold, and that it made its point as directly as it contrasted the black and white with the splotches of Technicolour.

This film is definitely more than a romantic comedy.The method of showing social changes through this 1950s TV show was a brilliant and original idea, and the film so cleverly shows how this happens even in todays society (for even so much as owning a double bed?). There are no clichés here, and the whole film is ofset with humor that almost satirizes what is happening and what has happened in our own society.Good choices for actors, very well-written, and the effects, although not mind-blowing, are good enough for the film and don't detract from the main focus. Some brilliant lines in it (""Fire!Fire!Cat?"") and a wonderful world with some wonderful characters too.A smart film with a very apparent social message, but still light and humorous, Pleasantville is a gem to watch. I have it as my number one, and I think it is severely underrated. I would advise anyone to watch it.",Pleasantville
320,adamw_13,floored,10,16 February 2003,"Some critics here are saying the movie takes itself too seriously - but I believe some people are taking it too literally. ... Saying that the topics that are addressed have no impact on society anymore, clearly misses the point. ... The 50s -- or more specifically, 50s TV -- is used as a metaphor, because of the way 50s TV portrayed life in America. ... Thematically, this movie is about ""Living Life"" to the fullest, whatever that means. More specifically, to live life to the fullest -- to truly feel ""alive"" -- you need to take the good with the bad. Sweeping things under the rug and just acting ""pleasant"" all the time, is no way to live. That's what Tobey McGuire's speech at the end to his ""real"" mother is all about. Bad things happen, it's part of life. Having passion brings with it positives and negatives -- but suppressing true feelings for the sake of ""pleasantness"" is an empty life. THAT is the key ... and that ""issue"" is everlasting to the human condition. Another point: People fear change. This is universal from the start of time until the end of time. The film suggests that changing and growing as a society and as people -- even if scary -- is good. Just because the 50s were used as a metaphor for that, don't believe for a minute this isn't a universal issue that exists today and forever.Another issue common for people critical of this film is the sexual issue. They say that Gary Ross is promoting sexual promiscuity, sex out of wedlock, etc...  Again, I believe it misses the point.  Is Ross suggesting that premarital sex is OK?  Yes, and I'd agree - and I'm sure there's plenty of people who don't agree with that, and that's OK too.  But, again, the sex is just part of the theme - used as a high-profile example to making the overall point about ""openness"" - and not suppressing one's feelings.  Note that the Reese Witherspoon character was already promiscuous, and her transformation was actually something completely different.I can't make everyone like this film - I'll just say that, on a personal note, I was so floored by this film, I had to see it again the next day. That had never happened to me before, or since. Ross' commentary goes on to speak of everything I felt about the film when I first saw it. It was great to hear that his reasons for what he did, meshed exactly with how I took it. I had to write him a letter to tell him so - another thing I'd never done before or since.This is not a perfect film. I liked its subtlety, but then the racism correlation, and the censorship stuff, got a bit more overt. The courtroom scene at the end is a bit cliche ... and I also agree with one poster who said that, to make the point about taking the good with the bad, we should've seen a bit more about the consequences of their actions.
Those are merely nitpicks in the grand scheme of things. This is a 10 out of 10.",Pleasantville
321,adamjbernay,Thinly Veiled (Im)morality Play Praising The Sexual Revolution,1,25 March 2004,"The premise of two modern teens being sucked into a Leave it to Beaver -esque sitcom and the shocks of their different views of the world sounded very interesting.  Then I watched the film...It turns out this movie's message is: ""Life before the sexual revolution was gray and insipid.  Living a life of convention values is a dull, dorky way to live.  Casual sex and violating the sanctity of marriage is the way to happiness.""  This is the attitude that brought the world the AIDS epidemic, massive teen pregnancy, single parent homes, and multiple generations of black inner-city families living in poverty with no way out.The point-of-view in this movie is deluded.  The black-and-white people are vicious caricatures of late 50s/early 60s conservatives, and the ""colored"" people are self-aggrandizing portraits of the New Left of the 60s.  You wouldn't know that the motives of the New Left were, in fact, to destroy the American way of life and bring about a socialist state.I am not speaking of the original Martin Luther King-led civil rights movement when I speak of the New Left; instead, I am speaking of the post-King Left that not only did not uphold Americanism as King did, but in fact reviled King in favor of Malcolm X, until King became a folk hero in later generations.For more on this, I recommend you read the autobiography of one of the primary intellectual leaders of the New Left who saw the folly of his ways, ""Radical Son"" by David Horowitz.  Also, his slim volume ""The Politics of Bad Faith"" is worth reading as well (all of his books are worth reading, to be honest).",Pleasantville
322,gardenwriter,Pleasant surprise,8,11 November 2004,When this film begins it looks like it may be a silly film directed mainly at teens. But the action soon takes us to a very different place - something that is dark and almost frightening. This film is a wonderful allegory of how covering up what is real and genuine in us can lead to corruption and pain - and also of how we can be redeemed. I had a hard time convincing my husband to watch this - and then to get him to sit through the first twenty minutes or so - but then he caught on and was as riveted as I was to the changes that occurred in Pleasantville when people actually gave into their real emotions and actually did something genuine.,Pleasantville
323,welsh_werecat,Moving,10,8 February 2005,"This is no doubt the best movie I have ever seen in my life. It makes the viewer THINK about, well, everything. It has a plot that could fit into any number of genres. Comedy, Romance, Sci-fi.. So many people look back to 'way back when' and bring up the views that Pleasantville shows, they believe it is a wonderful time, when, in fact, even for the most pleasant of lifestyles, things are taken away...such as free will, individuality, love. This film brings all these issues into light: Finding your own passion, allowing to be individual, not following the status quo. It shows topics such as racism and other bigotries tastefully and intelligently. I'd recommend this movie to anyone.",Pleasantville
324,designcbts,"Fresh, unique and contemplative",9,20 June 2005,"I cannot recall seeing anything like this movie before. The way it plays out, it's almost like I'm reading a book (and I mean that in a very good way). This is not only a ""pleasant"" movie, it's got a lot of great symbolism too. Because I don't want to give too much away, I won't go into details. Suffice it to say, it's a well-crafted film that I think is great for kids coming of age. It addresses many of the issues which continue to plague our world. It's evident that the entire cast and crew put a lot of themselves into the production. Yet, it manages to stay seemingly light for those of us who just want to vegetate. Although I saw the show when it first came out, it's remained one of my favorites. I loved seeing Don Knotts again!",Pleasantville
325,bjb,Less there than meets the eye,3,20 November 1998,"I found the movie very slow, very uneventful, and quite boring.The novelty of the plot and the ""black-and-white to color"" transition were all there was to it...the characters were as flat as the B/W Pleasantville regulars.",Pleasantville
326,RocktBoy,Truman show with a pulse,10,31 October 1998,"While this movie presented things that are unpleasant (pre-marital sex, adultery, prejudice against people different than you), The large unpleasantness was living outside one's mode of behavior, if only for a little while.The only thing this had in common with the Truman show was the presence of Television (therefore, why don't we compare it to the Cable Guy?)  Truman Show was such a surface level film, making it so popular with the common folk, I reckon.Don't misunderstand, I thought those ""unpleasant"" things were inappropriate, but it forced me to examine the quality of life of the initial setting.In contrast, the displaced kids learned to re-orient themselves as well.....Sure it wasn't a family film.  But it did make me think.",Pleasantville
327,fragman,"Very good, certainly worth seeing.",8,11 November 1998,"The premise is simple, but it gets developed fairly well. All the characters are satisfactorily fleshed out, no pun intended. I especially liked Joan Allen.  She has a certain presence that is unexplainable, and mesmerizing. (Her beauty may have something to do with it...)Some of the ""points"" the movie was trying to make were not clear, or conflicting, or inconsistent.  I eventually stopped trying to determine what Gary Ross was attempting to convey, and just enjoyed the movie viscerally. That worked better.Before seeing it, I was reminded of Truman, like many other people were. What really surprised me, more than anything, is that not once during the movie did I ever think of that comparison.This movie is technically brilliant, with regard to special effects.  This is almost enough by itself to make it worth a look.Go see it, it's well worth it.",Pleasantville

It's not like The Truman Show at all, in fact this was filmed first, I think. It's more Twilight Zone-ish. All the actors are fantastic, especially Joan Allen, Jeff Daniels, Tobey Maguire, J.T. Walsh, Don Knotts among others. See this movie-believe me it's worth it.",Pleasantville

330,cjshan,"A ""Pleasant"" Classic",10,24 October 1998,"It's easy for a movie to have a gimmick, more difficult for the gimmick to be pulled off with success, but ""Pleasantville"" does one better.  It uses its gimmick to become what I believe is a modern day classic.  This movie is a hybrid of ""The Truman Show"" and ""Back to the Future.""  Not only is the movie a technical marvel, but the story is fantastic.  Blending elements of such historical events as segregation and McCarthyism, this movie tries (and wonderfully succeeds) in showing us what happens when a ""perfect"" little black and white sitcom community begins to turn to color, simply because its citizens begin to act like real human beings.  The movie isn't without it's flaws, is probably fifteen minutes too long, and in the year of ""Saving Private Ryan"" it's a shame this movie will be overlooked come Oscar time (for Best Picture and all-around great performances, particularly Jeff Daniels).  I only hope it receives an ample number of deserved nominations, for this is one of the true masterpieces of American cinema.",Pleasantville
331,Creed1010,Caught between Cheesy and Genius,6,4 November 1998,"Pleasantville made me argue with myself whether I liked it or not.  It was a beautifully filmed movie.  I thought the cinematography was as good as movies get.  There were many times that the movie plot seemed tender and began to draw me in, however, there were just as many times that it made me roll my eyes.  Some scenes were as cheesy as they come.  I felt the film could have been funnier if the writers hadn't tried to cram so many of their ""inside-out"" morals into the film.  I think Pleasantville would have been a huge success in the earlier part of the century as a silent film.",Pleasantville

333,Mr. Liza,A triumph of technique,5,13 April 1999,"A triumph of technique, but, story-wise, a muddle.  Could Gary Ross possibly have tried to cram any more poorly thought-out ideas into the already weak plot.  Fascism, racism, sexual freedom, the joys of masturbation--all strung along an overlong, subpar episode of ""The Twilight Zone.""  I was so busy being wowed by the superb cinematography, art direction, and the like, that I--almost--didn't notice the huge plot holes I kept falling into.  As always, Joan Allen and William H. Macy are great, but here's hoping I never see Toby Maguire again.  He and Reese Witherspoon should be bound and gagged.",Pleasantville
334,Marc-86,Lovely film,10,31 January 2000,"I find it hard to describe this film without making it sound trite and overdone.  It is definitely not that.  But a movie where two kids get sucked into a TV show from the 50's?  It sounds like a reverse Brady Bunch Movie, or Switching Channels gone bad.But this really is a special film with a lot to say about our world.  For years we have blamed Eve for the Apple, but are we really so sure we want to LIVE in an untainted Eden?This film made me appreciate the times in which we live.  It's so easy to say, ""times were so much simpler long ago"", and pine for the simplicity of life in the 50s, especially if you are a white male.  But we mature and develop intellect for a reason.  Clearly, with that intellect, there is a trade-off, and by learning we cash in our innocence.  Some people would rather not know that bad things exist, and live with their heads in the soil, know that their dinner is on the table, and live in the 'burbs with a white picket fence.  But I, for one, would rather see the blue sky, the colors of the rainbow, even if it means that life is stressful and complex.I loved the way that Ross subtly draws analogies to the civil rights movement of the 60s, and the way that Jeff Daniels' character has love of art, even if his eyes can't see the colors to paint them.  And it is not without its humorous moments, with the ""breakfast of champions"" and the cubist Santa Claus.But coming back to it, Gary Ross made a heck of a picture to make me realize how great life really is right now, despite the hassles.  And the acting talent brought it all home to me.",Pleasantville
335,raven2u,Many important messages in this film,10,30 December 1999,"I was impressed with this film. The idea was genius, the acting was great too. This film will be recognized for the FX but the quality of story is my reason for voting it a ""10"". This film expresses messages about liking yourself/your life, as well as individual knowledge and racism. Many other issues are hidden in this film too. Pleasantville is the type of film you get something new from every time you watch it.The creator of this film/story was creative with their ability to weave the 50's to present time. I highly recommend this movie.",Pleasantville
336,Bj-49,An Incredible Achievement,10,13 November 1999,"I can say, without a doubt, that Pleasantville was a truly breathtaking and brilliant film. I cannot rave on about it enough, but I'll try right now. I didn't get the part at the start (looking at all the teachers in different classes, talking about future problems with sex, disease, employment, etc.) until later in the film, where it dawned on me that this was simply pointing out how different life in the 90s is to life in the 50s. I myself cannot verify whether life in the 50s was really like this, as I am only sixteen years old, but it was still interesting to compare them. That was what this film really achieved: it showed that while lifestyles have changed enormously over the past 40 or 50 years, human nature hasn't. The same racist and prejudiced attitudes still occur today, and this deeper meaning that lies under the surface of Pleasantville is what makes it such an achievement. But I'm jumping to halfway through the film, so I'll get back to the start. I also laughed at the part where Jennifer and David are fighting over the remote, and it is mirrored in Bud and Mary-Sue fighting over the transistor radio. I cracked up at the basketball team missing all their shots at the hoop after Skip has just spoken to them. I also laughed at Betty Parker asking Jennifer what sex was. These, among other moments, lifted the movie up, allowing it to be serious and get a message across, but at the same time being full of laughs. The special effects and photography in this movie were truly a masterpiece. For once, they were put to good use, rather than being used for crashes or explosions. The special effects department here obviously devoted a lot of time and effort to the colour differences. The part where a black and white tree bursts into coloured flames was excellent. The combination of coloured and black and white people in the courtroom was also well done. But what was truly visually stunning was the part where a black and white David/Bud and Margaret are driving in a yellow convertible down the road, while millions of pink petals blow around. This was one of the most beautifully made moments ever put in a movie, and I pressed rewind several times when I got Pleasantville on video, just to watch that part again. That is one of the rare moments you can find in a movie that never fails to make you smile. The lush photography in this movie further adds to the whole experience, making it even more worthwhile. Some criticism has risen about several aspects of the movie. DON'T LISTEN TO ANY OF IT. People have complained about the dramatic second half of the film being a miss. This is completely untrue: the second half is direct, straight to the point and gripping. The changes that make the people turn to colour in Pleasantville, when people break away from their normal selves, were also excellent. In particular, when Jennifer stops being a tart and starts enjoying simpler things like books. Also, the script was excellent. The film flowed seamlessly, and the acting was a dream. A lot of the actors here were relative unknowns, except for Reese Witherspoon, who I have also seen in Freeway, Cruel Intentions and Election. I must admit, she is a talented and convincing actor, and has shown that she can play a variety of roles: country gal, bimbo/sl*t, good girl and ambitious, ruthless schoolgirl. Both her, Joan Allen, and Tobey Maguire deserved to at least be nominated, and should have won, academy awards for their superb acting, and once you add nominations for art direction, special effects, best film... Pleasantville deserved to get at least about eight nominations, not just one or two. In short, Pleasantville was not about sex, or television (although it was much better than those other television-dissectional savvies, The Truman Show and EDtv), or 90s versus 50s. It was about breaking away from yourself, changing, and facing up to the prejudices that are ever-present in our society. I cannot recommend this movie enough, and it easily earns an 11 out of 10. Don't miss it.",Pleasantville
337,Darrell-270,"Great acting, cool special effects, bad ending",6,29 December 2001,"I really enjoyed this movie up until the end.  It's as if a different writer took over or the writer got lazy.  It got very weird, and I think it should have ended differently.  I was disappointed with the movie due to the ending.",Pleasantville
338,sheffi,A fun movie that's also food for thought,9,18 February 2001,"I enjoyed this movie. The premise is a little old (time travel, back the 1950s America) but it's treated in a novel way - characters go back to a 50s sitcom - that makes for an interesting ride. Tobey Maguire is good in this, more interesting to watch, I thought, than in the later Cider House Rules. Once the initial novelty of the situation has started to wear off, the movie starts to change - now the focus is no longer how to get the heroes home, but how they affect the sitcom characters. It's a culture shock that affects both sides. The gradual introduction of colour into the black and white world is wonderfully done and has dramatic meaning. Some reviewers have seen a political statement in the movie: apparently their brains switched off the second they saw the sign in the shop window ""No coloreds"". However, I saw this as a kind of joke, and the point is not pursued, certainly not belaboured. The point, rather, is the age-old story of how people react to change, and how they deal with the inevitable fear and uncertainty it brings. A fun viewing for all, teenagers and older (there are a couple of simulated sex scenes). By the final showdown, the focus has become emotional sterility and how to break through to a more fulfilling experience of life: a lot of themes for a ""comedy"", and on the whole very well handled.",Pleasantville
339,lisawtgm,A great nostalgic movie,9,4 December 2012,"This was such a incredible movie, the way they blended color and black and white at the right times to convey different emotions rather then just music was very well done. After seeing this movie you start to realize that there was a purpose to integrating black and white and color. A main theme of the movie was living life to its fullest, taking the good with the bad, taking a chance once and awhile. Tobey Maguire's speech at the end when he talks about sweeping things under the rug and basically acting pleasant all the time isn't the right way to live. It is a part of life that bad things happen. When you show yourself having passion its going to come with positive outcomes and negative, when you keep in the passion for the sake of being kind or cordial it becomes a empty life. Its a everlasting key to the human condition. People quite often fear change, its universal from beginning to end of time. The film does a great job of showing this fear and when society comes together they grow as a society and it becomes a good thing even when scary. The transitioning from black and white to color expressed this fear perfectly. Some would say that the director is promoting promiscuity, out of wedlock sex. Although there was a suggestion of a point about openness and not conceal ones feelings. Reese Witherspoon's character was already promiscuous but when she finished a book with no pictures the act of completing something and changing her behavior is what changed her into color. The catalyst of people changing in the movie is the eagerness to experience new things and to become vulnerable. I feel that movies like Pleasantville confront the viewer and compel them to think are very rare in today's world of Hollywood movies. Which should be treasured by any avid film-goer. To wrap this all up this is more than the old way and the new way after change. We need to see ourselves inside and out. If you live a life that is stuck and not changing then what you get is black and white. It is when we allow ourselves to mature as people that we are granted with the ability to see in colors or outside the box. The town is only opened up to the rest of the world when everyone is in color and then they are all able to travel outside the few streets in town. Its odd how everyone knows what color is but then don't want it or change when it appears everywhere.",Pleasantville

341,kelan360,Allows your outlook on things to be much more - pleasant,7,7 February 2016,"It is 1998, American suburban teens Jennifer (Witherspoon) enjoys her time with those of the opposite sex and is in need of guidance, and her brother David (Maguire) finds comfort in the of 50's soap show ""Pleasantville"" to simpler times in which dinner is always on the table when the Father comes home and everything is nice and pleasant.The movie is almost like a comparison of ideal 50's life and 90's life. In Pleasantville, David and Jennifer get transferred into the television show and live out the lives of Bud and Mary Sue. Bud and Mary Sue enter a world full of censorship, a world in which the only colors permissible are black, gray and white. In the world of Pleasantville there is no messing around, things are orderly, every shot in the basket goes in and at the end of the street is the beginning of the same street. Yet this goes a little astray when Bud and Mary Sue aren't as 'pleasant' as the rest of the town which restores some color; the first very delicate pink rose grows in a world full of gray. Gary Ross has done a great job telling the story much like in his most recent movie ""The Hunger Games"". Pleasantville is not particularly similar to The Hunger Games, yet is has some similarities like both Bud and Katniss step into strange alien world in which they change their surroundings, much like when Katniss wins the Hunger Games and wins the hearts of Panem, Bud attempts to unify all of the people of Pleasantville.The movie is a well filmed production and has a heart warming storyline and really makes you appreciate the world in which you live in.",Pleasantville
342,hw6,Naked woman on store overstepped,10,24 March 2006,"Although this movie was excellent, any culture at any time usually prohibits the display of nudity in public whether it's actual or in a painting. When the drug store owner painted a naked lady on his drugstore window he overstepped common social values. Liberals have always been looked at as using freedom to impose sexual content on the public, or they're are looked at as being just perverted in someway. Nothing is wrong with sex or nudity, but it shouldn't be displayed openly in public. Pleasantville misses this point. If the drugstore owner hadn't of painted the naked lady on the front of his store, it would have made a stronger point of how conservative, reactionary values are always trying to inhibit life and freedom.",Pleasantville

Personally, I RARELY want to watch a movie more than once. This is a pick-me up, feel-good movie. The pacing is perfect. There are little surprises at every turn. You will be cheering. Little nods to famous scenes - as in ""To Kill a Mockingbird"" with the courtroom scene. It's just absolutely wonderful. My favorite actors in this movie are Jeff Daniels and Joan Allen for their scene together, but all do a fantastic job! Worth it. Watch it.",Pleasantville
344,Susie-3,What happened to the Oscar nomination?,10,23 March 1999,"Pleasantville was easily one of the best movies I saw all year, and this was a good year for movies.  Yet this movie was overlooked in the best picture category, not only at the Oscars, but also at the Golden Globes, which has TWO best picture categories.  Virtually every review I saw for this movie placed it ahead of The Thin Red Line (including the ratings here on the IMDB), yet it got nominated and Pleasantville got shelved.This movie was original, and NOT a carbon copy of the Truman Show, as some have suggested.  I found it a clever approach to exploring such issues as racism, and I found most of the characters to be rich and diverse.  It was funny and yet poignant at the same time- a combination of comedy and drama that I believe tends to make the best movies.  And I never thought someone saying ""Where's my dinner?"" could be so funny.  William H. Macy was also robbed of an Oscar, once again.  The rest of the cast was good, too.As far as the comment that Joan Allen turning into colour didn't make her radiant: what movie were you watching? We were not supposed to view her as the next supermodel.  Attaining colour was not about physical attractiveness.  This movie was about discovering yourself, which is what she did, and as far as I am concerned, that was all that was supposed to make her radiant.  Her beauty laid inside her.  If this is not the message a person took away, I could understand them not liking the movie, just as I have not liked movies that I did not get the point of.  If you did not get the point, maybe it would be worthwhile to watch the movie again, because it really is excellent.I also found the notion of the people in Pleasantville only becoming real throughout the course of the movie intriguing.  It is interesting to think of an entire world being created right before your very eyes, to watch the townspeople evolve and develop and mature, a miniature version of our own world, plagued by the same problems and enriched with the same joys.  I've found it interesting to imagine what might happen if such a world were to be created- how quickly would that world become like our own, or would it become that way at all? I don't think the goal of this movie was to instill such thoughts in people, but it did so in me nonetheless, and that is one thing I enjoy in a movie, for it to be thought-provoking.  And Pleasantville, being the intelligent and complex-yet-simple film it is, accomplishes this nicely.  And this is why it deserved an Oscar nomination, aside for for best costume design.  I am not saying it should have won (I haven't seen Shakespeare in Love yet), but it certainly deserved the honour of a nomination.",Pleasantville
345,zoniedon,A 'pleasant' surprise,7,26 October 1998,"Although the plot was revealed in the trailers and ads, I was surprised at the tone of the movie. It was more serious than I was expecting, yet it did have some funny moments and some clever twists. The film touches on social mores in the latter half and the film holds up admirably despite its long running time. (Slightly more than two hours) The casting was inspired. Pleasantville is inventive and entertaining. I enjoyed watching people leaving the theater appearing to not know what just hit them.",Pleasantville

I enjoyed it, but I'd like the creators of this film to know something: THERE WAS ALREADY A TV SHOW MOVIE THIS YEAR! IT WAS CALLED THE TRUMAN SHOW! The Truman Show was innovative, and this one was also, but not AS innovative.",Pleasantville
348,Blackfly,Clever idea. Too much philisophical baggage.,7,28 October 1998,"For the most part, Pleasantville was a clever and interesting film driven by a very unique concept (a ""Stay Tuned meets Quantum Leap"" sort of deal). Had this movie JUST been about two teenagers whose actions disrupt (and colorize) the fictional black and white town, it might have passed off as a heart-warming family film (or brainless feel-good entertainment, depending on how you look at it).  Certainly the idea was original and well developed enough to hold my attention for the duration of the movie, but apparently the author couldn't leave it at that. The problem with Pleasantville is that it begins to take itself too seriously.  By the middle of the movie, the author takes to drawing rather blatant connections to racial prejudice (""no coloreds""), a topic which has been more than adequately explored in numerous movies of a much higher caliber than this one.  Such dry and unfocused social criticism certainly will not bring to light any new insights on the nature of racism. I reluctantly admit that by this point in the movie I was coming dangerously close to mistaking the film's clumsy, surface-deep moral probing for actual profundity.  However, this sentiment is smartly struck down in the movie's climax, which is weakly done and lacks any sort of metaphorical foundation.  Pleasantville solves its problems so easily and unambiguously you'd think the author forgot he was writing about just a moment before. Prejudice, violence, and hate are not so easily solved in Care Bear fashion as this movie suggests. All that aside, you can enjoy the movie well enough if you try not to employ critical thinking.  In my opinion, this movie stands somewhere on the favorable side of mediocre, but I doubt it will be showing up on anyone's favorite movies list.",Pleasantville
349,SwingKid-2,This is a great film that let's you wonder what perfection really is.,9,28 October 1998,"When I saw Pleasantville I thought it was going to be a cheesy comedy about some teenagers getting sucked into the television. But in actuality it is a movie about a kid, David, who's fed up with the reality that he lives in. (i.e the violence, disease, and divorce) So he picks up the remote and turns on a cheesy old 50's show called Pleasantville to escape reality. His sister, Jenifer, is a super-popular slut who gets mixed up in the whole sucked into the t.v. business. But when the brother and sister duo start adding some life to the card-board cut-out characters and things start to turn colors does the real meat and brilliance of the movie begin.When things start to turn colors, life starts to breathe into the characters of Pleasantville. The color, of course, is symbolic for life and imperfection. Sure in black and white everything is nice but there is no joy and understanding. The color is the spice of life, like reading and music. For instance when David starts talking about where he comes from to a girl from Pleasantville, who's enjoying the colors and life, he tells her how horrible it is yet she says to him, ""it sounds exciting!""This film asks the question, is perfection what it's cracked up to be? The answer is no. It shows us that the colors and souls and decisions of life are wonderful, even if the side products like war and poverty aren't that great. As David says, ""you can't stop something that's inside you."" That is why Pleasantville is a movie that should not be missed by anyone who is a fan of life.",Pleasantville
350,Dave-291,A lovely film to watch,9,5 November 1998,"This is an exquisitely beautiful film.  ""Pleasantville"" possesses some of the most beautiful cinematography I've ever seen in my life.  The transitions from black and white to colour are superlative, and the scene where Tobey Maguire's character and his girlfriend drive up to Lover's Lane is quite possibly the single greatest filmic image ever.William H. Macy is fabulous in this film, as he is in most of his work.  He IS the father from the 1950's, with that inherent rigidity and innocence that the perfect world of television was enveloped in.  The rest of the cast played their parts well, but on the whole, didn't really do anything extraordinary.  Nonetheless, the film is a must-see.This film will win best picture and best cinematography.  Just as ""Titanic"" (though it was a significantly flawed film) had at least one element everyone could relate to or enjoy, so too does ""Pleasantville"".  See it and enjoy it.",Pleasantville
351,kafka-6,almost too pleasant,8,5 November 1998,"This movie had wonderful visuals, a good storyline, and a likable cast.  There were, however, a few things that kept me from putting the movie on my all-time favorites list.  First, there seems to be a simplistic one-to-one correlation made between sex and enlightenment, and though there are events later on in the movie which suggest that this isn't quite the case, sex and (secondarily) art seem to be the only really powerful ""coloring"" influences. Second, though I realize that Pleasantville is essentially a fable about censorship and the silliness of trying to separate life into ""acceptable"" and ""unacceptable"" categories, there are some cloying inconsistencies: For instance, the ""black and whites"" harass the ""coloreds"" in a violent manner, and they don't suddenly turn colored (though the mayor's transformation suggests that they should have).  Notably, the only people who act unpleasant in Pleasantville are the black and whites.  Those who become ""colored"" are not really transformed into ""real"" people(as the film would seem to suggest) with flaws, they are transformed into a sort of idealized enlightened society.  Like the 50s sitcoms they lampoon, the film-makers have chosen to ignore those things which might possibly be unpleasant.  The characters bring art, beauty, and enlightenment to Pleasantville, and suddenly everything seems hunky-dory.  The End.  Roll Credits.  I guess I'm cynical, but in my imagination, after the end of the film, the inhabitants of Pleasantville start having to deal with teen pregnancy, sexually transmitted diseases, spouse abuse, alcoholism, and pollution; then the good citizens of Pleasantville start thinking, ""It's nice that we can read, and go to the bathroom, and have sex, and see pretty colors, but was it really worth it?""",Pleasantville
352,China-9,Expect something different when you go to see this movie.,10,29 December 1998,"I was surprised when I went to see this movie. It was not at all what I expected. It was much more. I recently made a dramatic change in my life and this movie beautifully depicts the ""color"" change can bring to your life. Many 90's viewers will not find this movie ""fast"" enough for them. This movie relies on a strong script, beautiful cinematography, and fine performances. It delivers all three in spades. This movie will haunt me for a long time.",Pleasantville
353,Gath,What a Pleasant Surprise!,8,8 April 1999,"Well, having seen very little in the way of previews for this movie, I didn't expect much more than a slapstick silly movie.  I must say that I am extremely impressed by the writing talent of Gary Ross.Being a big fan of old TV shows myself, I enjoyed the magnificent display of Black & White alongside Color on the same screen.  Anyone who watches B&W TV programming knows that you don't need color to be able to tell what color Herman Munster's skin is or what color dress June Cleaver is wearing.  Ross did a great job of capturing that look, and then showed everything to us again in color, which I personally enjoyed a great deal.That, however, is not the really surprising part about this movie.  After all, Ben Hur had some amazing sets and wonderful costuming, but that's not why it's a great movie - it all comes down to what story is being told. Pleasantville was an incredibly unique take on oppression in its many forms, and as much a political statement as a comedy.  I couldn't believe I hadn't seen it coming sooner.I give Pleasantville an 8.  The story was great, the directing was very good, and the cinematography was beautiful.  I did see some room for improvement from most of the cast.  Other than Jeff Daniels, who performed about as well as he always does - nothing amazing, but no major problems, and Tobey Maguire, who did a great job, I saw a lot of over-acting.",Pleasantville
354,Stanton-5,Good film and a redeeming ending,10,11 September 1999,"I thought this film had fine qualities for viewing, but what really suckered me was the ending. The way ""Across the Universe"" blended in with images of what we would love America to be and how much we long for innocense.  I thought the dialogue the mother and son had at the end really gave this slightly above the average film of teenage lust/love a redeeming quality like ending.  I am not a fan really of teen based movies, but there was enough comical and tender romance to keep me interested.  I recommend this movie to practically anyone who loves a film that has good direction, and this one has great direction in it. Ross has done an excellent job with an average script and story.  Many kudos for him.",Pleasantville
355,SirRadiodude,"A diamond in the rough, with many lessons to teach!",10,31 August 2003,"A great movie many passed by. If you don't like to think... at all during a movie (XXX, ARMAGEDDON, TITANIC) this isn't the movie for you, stay away! To those who do like to learn, be inspired, and use that history stuff you learned at school this movie is it. This movie could be shown in school is my opinion, because it has so many historical references. Some of which are; civil rights inequality in USA (obvious), Kristalnocht in Germany, Pogues in Germany, Biblical references (obvious), Hitler-esc speeches and nationalism, and Censorship battles. If that ain't enough, see J.T. Walsh (Big Bob) play an amazing character, and one of his last before his death in 1998. Reese Witherspoon (oh soo soo hot), Tobey McGuire, and William H Macy serve up some other best performances as well. This movie got shafted by viewers at the box-office so pay it some dues and rent it soon, you won't regret it.",Pleasantville
356,Shanna-4,multifaceted and enlightening,10,15 July 2002,"It's difficult to categorize the the social commentary of this movie. Bigotry, small mindedness, routine bound, denials of emotion, and mostly ignorance are attacked in this film.  The only advocasy is that ideas are not something to be frightened of.We can try to be emotionally safe, but what do we gain and what joy is to be had from this sort of ""conservatism.""  Often, what seems the safest is the most detrimental to us all.When most everyone changed, Mary Sue and Bud turned to each other and asked, ""why are we still black and white?""  Bud had to find his dignity and Mary Sue, her intellectual capacity.  And this begs the question, what is inside us that we need to tap.  Is it a sense of beauty, like the soda shop owner? The revelation when he saw the works of Rembrandt, Monet, Cezanne, Van Gogh, Picasso and Turner.  Most of these artists were scorned during their lifetime by the establishment of art.New ideas are difficult to accept.  That's not to say that all things new are good, but change is inevitable nonetheless, and so with technology. The world of Pleasantville suddenly grew where buses took people off to college, as opposed to a circular street.There are several epochs in human history where change was resisted, but ideas are hard to thwart, and that process of trying to hold back that change sometimes is ugly.  This is seen in the Code of Conduct, but you know this could have been during the sixties when schools measured girl's skirt and boy's hair length.  Why for?This movie offers a great deal to think about.   Read a book, see painting. Get out of your routine lives and LIVE.",Pleasantville
357,hush_a_bye_angel-2,Remarkably amazing,9,17 July 2001,"The concept is simple: transport into a movie through the tv screen into the tv program and then - attempt to get out. But somehow the story writers managed to make it a lot more complicated than that. Adding a remarkable change from one world into another, one can see the simple things in life that we take for granted. Though at times this movie seemed a little slow - aspects of it never seemed to amaze me in such that there was so much more to the movies that meets the eye. A sweet, touching movie, glossed over with outstanding actors and ability. Leaving the audience gripped to the characters and their will to alter whatever life the Pleasantville folk have into what the perceive it should be. A gripping story that will capture the minds and hearts of all but the stone hearted.",Pleasantville
358,Stoker007,Wouldn't it be great,10,25 August 2003,I've seen this movie a number of times and have now purchased the video so I can go back in time to a place that I'm sure I should have grown up in ( my friends think I did ) It's a great Idea for a movie and all the characters play their roles so well. The mixture of the black and white then colour is brilliant. This is one of my Fav's.,Pleasantville
359,realchuckrambo,The Irony of Pleasantville,10,25 December 2020,"So, what is the irony of Pleasantville? The irony is that when this film was made it was intended as a ""hit"" on conservatives. But now the ""bad"" people who are portrayed in Pleasantville really resemble today's leftists. Today's leftists are most definitely burning books, cancelling people who don't agree with them, destroying art and statues that bother them, etc.Pretty funny, right? It really is hilarious.",Pleasantville
360,camera_obscura1,absolutely AMAZING,10,4 October 2003,"this movie is incredible! i love the way the writers incorporated the various racial segregation problems of history into the movie. the movie is brilliantly acted, written, directed, etc. this is definately one of my favorite movies of all time. rather than boring anyone who is reading this with a long opinion, let me just say this: I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS WONDERFUL MOVIE!",Pleasantville
361,maggie_rufflo,so much deeper then what meets the eye,9,8 January 2002,"I just saw the movie and even though time has passed for three hours I can only think of the same comment for this film...WOW! It was an absolute surprise for me. I didn't want to watch the film because I thought that it would be a flop.(I didn't know who the actors were, so I didn't know what to expect) My mother rented it and so I sat down to watch what I thought was to be a mediocre film. After an hour, I completely changed my mind. The film which started out with the story of two teens- a brother and a sister. They both lived in a regular house, alone with their Mother and they didn't get along at all. After a fight over the remote control, they both end up magically falling into a black and white T.V. program called Pleasantville. There they meet the type of family they never even heard of, the perfect one. The type of family were the Mother is home as a house wife and the father is at work making money for the family. While David(now called Bud) and his sister Jennifer(now called Mary Sue) try to fit into this abnormal setting, they realize that the town is not really...well real! Every child is perfect, there's no sex, drugs, or lying.Bud likes the new life-but his sister absolutly can't stand it! After she starts to muddle with the people's lives in Pleasantville, something peculiar starts to happen-everything starts to become colored!Now what seemed to start as a comedy, turns into something serious. The film starts to show the darkness of human behavior and what happens when people are frightened of things that they don't understand.Even though this movie has a wonderful plot and setting, a movie would not be complete without acting skills. I was quite surprised to see young Tobey Maguire play such a role. I haven't seen him in anything else-but am looking forward to it in the future. He portrayed the young, innocent boy Bud very well. His partner Reese Witherspoon who played Mary Jane was a match that I have to give Ellen Lewis and Debra Zane, the casting crew a thumbs up for. Together, Tobey and Witherspoon made the perfect match to show what a good kid can do compared to the bad one!The movie was absolutly perfect. It told a very important lesson that some people forget because it is not seen as clearly anymore. It showed how one family can stick together and fix anything if they work together. I recommend this movie for all ages.",Pleasantville
362,lemonaidkid,"Worst ""message"" movie of the 90s",1,26 June 2009,"Deserves a ""1"" rating for excellent b/w photography and color effects. Otherwise this is a ""0"" and a stellar example of the subliminal and pervasive 'Frankfurt School' leftist subversion that has tainted Hollywood product since Stalin was old enough to grow a mustache. The real shame is that generation after generation is now being sold a bill of goods on Cold War-era America that is driven by the same tired Old Soviet Bloc propagandistic nonsense that HUAC had been vilified by 'the press' for investigating back then. I wish someone would make a fact-based film about the Army-McCarthy hearings and finally show on which side the ""decency"" REALLY resided in that affair.",Pleasantville
363,lrocksalot,A unique movie that i did nothing but enjoy. Send my regards to Gary Ross.,9,25 June 2011,"In short terms, this is one of the best movies i've seen in a while. seriously think this is one of Tobey Maguire's best performances, along with so many other great actors and actresses that i don't even have to name. And the beauty of the scenery is just the icing on the cake. The best thing about this movie is that it only gets better each time you watch it, because you understand more of what's happening. It's hard to say anything that hasn't already been said, so all i have to say is, i fully recommend this to anybody that appreciates the more subtle movies that have so much more meaning and depth to them. It was just so, how do i put this, ""pleasant."" Gary Ross, i send my regards.",Pleasantville
364,MikeJone,"Nothing to see here, move along",1,23 December 2007,"This is an awful movie, let me say that right off the bat. The premiss for the movie seemed to have potential but it turns out to be a disaster. I'm watching the movie and I'm thinking ""what is the point?"", ""if I watch it a bit longer it will go somewhere, have something to say, something, anything"". I (painfully) watched it to the end and nope, nothing. The movie is a desert, there's just nothing there.Let me explain, what DOES the movie say? From what I could gather the message seems to be that human beings have good and bad in them. Not only good and bad strictly speaking but also somethings that lie perhaps in some gray area and some others that have nothing to do with morality such as artistic drive. In short, human beings are what they are - a mass of contradictions with many different facets, so on a so fourth. Further the message seems to be that we are better off - that it is better (?) - as such than as one-dimensional characters with only, shall we say ""pleasant"", characteristics.And that's it. I looked, I tried to find something more, but there is nothing else. Now, I ask my self how retarded is that? That insults the viewer's intelligence, even. Do we really need a - however long this movie is - to tell us the above? Without bad there can't exist good, right? As obvious as that is the movie doesn't even make that point. It's too much of a barren wasteland. It just seems to make the point that we are ""better off"" the way we are than as some sort of one-dimensional automatons. Which is in-itself debatable because if the so-called automatons are happy and it is a well known fact that humanity at large for the most part isn't, and I personally see no point nor meaning in life or existence anyway, perhaps it would be better to just be happy.But such considerations, or indeed any others, never get any air time.",Pleasantville
365,z3188548,Pretty close to perfect,10,7 October 2021,"I've always loved this movie but watching it again a few times recently I've realised how stunning it is.

368,Slava,This movie is a strange animal -highly moralistic comedy about moralistic TV serials.,3,7 November 1998,"I am a little bit confused about this movie: I cannot agree more that freedom is a great thing and  that truth in presentation of reality on the screen is very valuable thing too. I also agree that only very bad people can burn books and be impolite to women. However, if this movie against some violation of freedoms in 1950-s, it seems that it is too easy to fight what was already defied. If it have something to say about freedom (or its absence) today, I would prefer it was told more directly. If it just says that freedom and individual self-expression are great: things - thank you that you remind it to me, but I believe that I knew it already and is more  concerned that saying it is easier thing that reaching it. For me it looks as a movie made by standard receipt: use abstract (and good, no discussion) ideas and make an entertainment on their basis. Personally, I don't like it. It's too childish. And I prefer Princess Bride as a children movie. I should say that as an entertainment this movie is decent, at least it is more natural than ""Truman Show"".",Pleasantville
369,Antti,Best achievement in film history,10,18 April 1999,Stunning film. You can't compare this to anything. This gives you so much more than any other film. Everything that has been done in the film-industry in the last 100 years is just a little footnote somewhere in this movie. You can just forget about all the other moviemakers that have existed and see this one anyway you can.,Pleasantville
370,scaramou,Great escapism,10,15 June 1999,"Savor this movie! The basic Twilight-Zone plot of the blurring (and eventually disappearing) lines between fantasy and reality is not really new, but Pleasantville turns out to be a real original for a few reasons. The Art Direction is superb; the movie looks like a freshly painted canvas. The look of the film within a film makes you want to suspend reality and step into the old TV-show set yourself, to smell the clean air and reminisce about the way things never really were. The cast is charming and unpredictable and really has you rooting for the characters. This one should have won at least a few awards.",Pleasantville

It is a magical escape filled with the whole range of human emotion that never waivers from the moral of its story.People from all backgrounds can appreciate the movie, but on a personal basis, I thought it spoke volumes on what it means to be gay, although there is no gay plot, no gay story line and no gay characters.  I'm sure many others will find their own humanity in ""Pleasantville"" even if it makes them different from the norm.  I hope you get a chance to see ""Pleasantville"". You will be pleasantly surprised that this is no ""normal"" comedy.",Pleasantville

373,Joy-11,Disappointing,4,25 October 1998,"While there are some good moments in this film, including excellent performances by Joan Allen and William Macy, it was pretty bad overall.

374,daf-2,"Great acting, confused message",6,28 February 1999,"I left the cinema having seen Pleasantville annoyingly confused at the messages the film seemed to be delivering.Boy's world sucks because of divorcing parents, social awkwardness, etc.  So boy gets sucked into the TV show he watches to escape these problems.  Then boy becomes committed to adding colour to make TV world more like the place he just escaped from...but this time everything happens to turn out perfectly.  Perhaps this could have been done very well, but I wasn't left with the impression that it had been.There were some great moments, the acting was superb and I enjoyed much of it, yet the overall message just seemed confused and lost.",Pleasantville
375,Jesse-13,Seriously surreal,9,24 October 1998,"This is a quirky, charming, but disarming movie, that blurs the distinction between the myth and reality of life in the Fifties as portrayed on television, to liberate characters from an oppressive life that was fictional to begin with.  But our teenaged daughters loved it, and one caught an allusion in the courtroom scene to ""To Kill A Mockingbird"" that went right past me.  I want to see it again -- one, to figure it out, but two, to enjoy it again.",Pleasantville
376,Kronos-6,Nice but a bit overly drawn out,8,3 December 1998,"It's hard to imagine me saying it, but I found the film a little too didactic. The message was made and then it was hammered and hammered and hammered again.Aside from this, it is a really nice film. Touching and sentimental yet at the same time challenging a status quo. This is one of its greatest features...it offers an alternative to ""conservative family values"" without being radical and threatening to a contemporary audience.Then there's the visual work. I am simply amazed at the amount of wonder that can be produced by slowly adding color to a film. Very effective. Too bad we can't all see trees burst into flame in our front yard from the sheer intensity of our feelings.",Pleasantville
377,Lazlo Woodbine-2,A nice surprise which deserved to be a bigger hit,10,6 April 1999,I thought this film was one of the most original and interesting I have seen in a while.  It managed to be intelligent and thoughtful without being pretentious.  I urge anyone to see this.,Pleasantville
378,Stormy-3,"Pretty good, but it could have been great",9,10 November 1998,"I really was looking forward to seeing this movie, and in many ways it justified my expectations. However, once again Hollywood had to throw in too much sex and spoil the mix. It was OK for comedy, and the first backseat scene, where Reese Witherspoon introduces her date to the joys of sex, was pretty funny. But the bathtub scene (that's all I'll say!) made a lot of people I was with uncomfortable, and didn't add all that much. While the mother was a pivotal character, she could have ""gained her color"" in other ways. (I know, I know... this sounds prudish, but it was supposed to be the 50's for heavens sake!)The movie really got good towards the end, when the completely obvious racial symbolism started showing up. 'Pleasantville' did a great job of showing the irrational fears that people get when they encounter something different. And the special effects were some of the best I'd ever seen - not only were they great technically, but unlike most movies, they actually served the story!Overall, I liked the movie. The message about being yourself is right on, and much needed... but in general, the movie could have been more effective if it had been presented more tastefully.",Pleasantville
379,Tanik,See it. . . Now!,9,28 October 1998,"What an incredible movie... It was much better than I expected. Excellent job acting, especially from Maguire, and the woman who played the mother. (Her name leaves me offhand.) I had such an enjoyable time. The plot and the writing was fantastic. Really enjoyed watching the effects with the black and white and color combined. Looked very realistic. SPOILERS: Look for this one great scene with Maguire, the Mom, and makeup. Was not expecting the romance that I saw there. But, the whole sex thing bothered me a lot. I would have given it a 10 if they had not placed so much emphasis on that. This is definitely a must-see. Ladies, we definitely have a new looker in Tobey Maguire. Check it out! :)",Pleasantville
380,jerm-6,Profound movie with a campy premise,7,29 November 1998,"The first twenty minutes of this film gave me acid-like flashbacks to that John Ritter catastrophe Stay Tuned. But unlike Stay Tuned's one-joke premise (when Ritter flashes into an episode of Three's Company), Pleasantville engaged me on many levels.The film stimulated my intellect while entertaining my eyes with amazing colorizing effects. Unfortunately, the director felt it necessary to bring the film full circle by tacking on a sappy and drawn-out conclusion.Aside from the goofy beginning and ending, the silly concept of a magical remote control and the occasional interruption by the irritating Don Knots (also from ""Three's Company), this film presents about 80 minutes of highly enjoyable and profound cinema.",Pleasantville

382,brandy-19,A triumph! Outstanding!,10,7 April 1999,"Gary Ross' directorial debut is as fine of a film as 1998 saw. With dazzling cinematography and fine performances he guides what appears to be a delightful comedy into waters so few venture, that which is profound and thoughtful. This is by no means a subtle film. However, it takes its premise and runs with it finding a theme of how change is a necessary and often unavoidable fact of nature that is very healthy. Wonderful.P.S. Randy Newman's score is Oscar-worthy.",Pleasantville
383,Lyss26,"Joy, hope, and wonder beautifully put together!",8,26 February 1999,"I had no idea what I was going to see when I first sat down to see this film, and I was impressed beyond all belief. This was the first movie to really move me, with its buoyant, optimistic take on life and reality. I left the theater happier than I had ever been after a film, and even after a second viewing it still holds up and puts a big grin on my face, nudging me to go outside and LIVE!This film is beautifully done- the effects are gorgeous and stunning as color is sneaked into the ""perfect"" world of Pleasantville. The acting is excellent, and while the storyline and dialogue admittedly run towards the overly sentimental, overall the story is too enchanting to cynically dimiss as tripe. The many allusions in the film (to segregation, To Kill a Mockingbird, etc.) are added bonuses for those who care to look.Undoubtedly one of the best films of the year.",Pleasantville
384,jobe-2,Hated it!,1,6 April 1999,"Pleasantville was not as good as I thought it would be.  It was such a worldly movie.  It had affairs and other sexual stuff that are considered immoral.  It was like if you could have sex you would become colored and cool.  Pleasantville was a really cool place, but as the movie progressed it became more worldly and worse.  I hated this movie so much and I can't believe this movie made any money at all.",Pleasantville

386,Natedog-3,A unique and fascinating look at people and change in America,10,7 May 1999,"This film is simply great!  Just the fact that it has spured so many intense feelings about its importance and meaning ought to be enough to convince one that it is definitely worth a look.  I have seen this movie with so many different people, and -whether they liked or disliked it - they all focused on different aspects of it.  That alone should prove its timeless value and wide range of appeal.  I must say, however, that although it is hands down my favorite movie of 1998 I disagreed with its point that the 50's mentality has more to learn from the present day's mentality than vice versa.  Oh, well.  Joan Allen is terrific!  And the cinematography is, of course, beyond anything I have ever seen!  I applaud Gary Ross, the director, writer, and producer, for creating such a beautiful and thought-provoking film.",Pleasantville
387,hal9000-22,a masterpiece that deserves more recognition,10,27 May 1999,"My one line summary says it all.  So many people have viewed this film and slept through its deeper meaning.  They live the movie saying ""it's a good film"".  It's more than that.  Gary Ross made an intelligent film.  He shows us that with all the evil, tension, and discrimination the world is facing, we are making progress into a land of true prosperity: prosperity of the soul.  The audience must delve deeper into this well crafted plot to notice the allusion to America and to the Human Race in general.  Conformity may leave our minds free from burden, but it is difference that colors our spirit.",Pleasantville
388,DebReed,Really Disturbing,1,25 June 1999,"Pleasantville is the only movie I have ever walked out on.It was advertised as a family movie as creative as The Truman Show, but ended up being a boring two-hour commercial for how sex outside of marriage has brought society out of the blah dark ages of the 50's.The disturbing message and boring plot completely overshadowed the mildly interesting special affects and the Twilight Zone type plot.  Save your money and rent The Truman Show.",Pleasantville
389,creeping_jesus,Leave your brain at the door,1,30 May 2000,"because you certainly wont be requiring it once the film begins.Yet another incomplete plot with pretensions of social commentary added as an afterthought.What rubbish.Luckily I had free tickets so the only thing Im really angry at is the incredible waste of time the whole thing was-not to mention the tragic mess made of a fine Lennon tune(ok, THAT wasnt too bad).Also, as a parting thought, does anybody REALLY think Toby Maguire can act? Really?...no, I didnt think so",Pleasantville
390,zoni4316,Worn out themes perfect for an audience of 12 year olds,2,20 May 2000,"This is without a doubt one of the most air headed movies to hit the big screen in recent years. It tries to be a very serious message movie and a fun lighthearted one at the same time. Better to take it as a bad joke of a movie than as a serious one. It really fails on both levels. The sophomoric sledgehammer metaphors really sunk this one for me.The conflict is a modern 90's, sexually aware, colorful, liberal pop culture (good) against a 50's style uptight, repressed, black and white, conservative town (evil). Both sides are portrayed in stereotypes so narrow they look like they were written by a 12 year old. Gee, where have I seen a them like that before? The ""black and white"" people are conservative ugly racists, while the good liberal ""colorful"" people are wonderful because they get to be true to themselves and become sexually aware because they masturbate.Perhaps the most ridiculous scene is where the girlfriend picks a red apple from a tree and hands it to the hero. The film plays with many religious and moral issues but doesn't have a single thought provoking thing to say about them. Anyone who wants a film with religious messages can surely find better ones than this! The best part of the film is Reese Witherspoon's performance. She plays a ""good"" character who has an ugly side of her own. She can't save the film on her own though because the characters are nothing more than cardboard cut-outs. This film is full of the kind of dumbed down politically correct drivel that is very popular these days. Those who think that Al Gore is a hero will probably think that Tobey Maguire's character in this film is one also. Too bad there is no room for either character to come to an understanding of REAL adults.",Pleasantville
391,glorendil,"Excellent! Smart, amazing, deep - more than meets the eye!",10,25 June 2001,"At the time of this comment, I've seen the movie 3 times, and enjoyed it every time. I kept finding new things in the movie, new symbols, and there aren't many movies like that. The beginning is a bit slow, and for those who don't like science fiction it may seem silly. However, the movie is far from it. The plot picks up a pace and suddenly the seemingly silly movie is serious... You'll find yourselves in the middle of the storm. The characters (and not only the main characters!) evolve and grow throughout the movie, and some scenes may send chills down your spine... At the end, I found many statements that the movie was making, and I expect to find more the next time I see it (and I will see it again). As far as I remember the critics didn't like it, and I think it was highly underrated, and for no good reason. As I was saying, I highly recommend it. Last note - for those who have seen ""Chocolat"", you'll probably like it, as much as those who have seen it will like ""Chocolat"".",Pleasantville
392,kalisana,"A quiet, little masterpiece",7,23 October 2002,"This is a very nicely constructed allegory for both the US in the 1960s and western civilisation from the dark ages to now. As a history lesson, Pleasantville was almost magical in the way it revealed the role of art and literature (not to mention guilt-free sex) in elevating humankind to greater heights while demonstrating the dark forces that have always fought this progress. The good old boys of Pleasantville don't look particularly nice but their kind weren't particularly nice during all of western civilisation's progroms against people who were ""different"". Having said that, the film is never cynical about ""small-town USA"" or the people who live there. In fact, it's a warm and affectionate nostalgia for either the director or writer's memory of the ""good old days"". Pleasantville does get a bit cornball at times but nothing is too overstated or sentimental as to undermine the package -- which includes a fine cast delivering some pretty good performances, a great soundtrack and some very amusing one-liners (my favourite: ""We're safe, we're in a bowling alley."") in an otherwise user-friendly and thought-provoking polemic.",Pleasantville
393,rachaelallison2,How could someone NOT like this movie?,9,13 March 2010,"Pleasantville is a beautiful coming of age story. Jennifer (Mary-Sue, in Pleasantville) and her brother David (Bud) both have a lot of growing up to do in their own ways. After being sucked into Pleasantville, so to speak, they both open a whole, big world to the members of Pleasantville. Starting with Skip, who's Mary-Sue's love interest. She opened his world to the wonders of sex. I have read many reviews about this movie saying it's just all pro pre-marital sex. Not even close to what this movie is about!!It's about discovering the beauty that out not-so-perfect world has to offer. I love that the people in this movie discover themselves sexually, artistically and intellectually. Even rain is a beautiful thing.Bud even gets the Mayor to see the emotion that is inside of him all the time. I cry at this movie every time- of course, I cry at a lot of movies. I am in love with how creative, beautiful and deep this movie truly, truly is.",Pleasantville
394,Lord-Sean-of-ignorance,All is well in Pleasantville,8,18 March 2004,"What I liked about this film is how Tobey Maguire's and Reese Witherspoon's characters introduced change in the perfect little town of Pleasantville. I like all of the references that it made to real life; about accepting change, overcoming hard times and prejudice against a certain group of people.  The way the black and white people tried to hold back the people in color and the things that caused it really stood out for me.I thought Tobey Maguire's character, David Wagner/Bud Parker, was the coolest.  He knew so much about the show `Pleasantville,' loved the idea of living in the show and yet he when things started to change from black and white to color, he embraced the idea of things changing in a perfect world.The scene that left an image in my mind was the scene where the black and white people trashed Bill Johnson, Jeff Daniels character's, diner because of the color art on the window.  There was so much hatred and violence in that scene that it left an image in my mind.I would definitely recommend this movie to people who are fans of Reese Witherspoon, Tobey Maguire, Jeff Daniels, or William Macy.",Pleasantville
395,capggg,Good fantasy film that is poignant in its views,10,4 April 2004,"Pleasantville is cut from the same cloth as the Back to The future movies but it's a lot more serious than they in terms of what its trying to say are. It deals with intolerance, and the way people refuse to change for the better.  Toby Maguire and Reese Witherspoon are great as the brother and sister duo who travels to this fictional television town and causes mayhem with their modern ways of doing things. In their wake find a town that is devoid of feelings and maturity, and find out that people in this town are not what they seems once they get a tasted of the outside world. William H Macy, Joan Allen, and J.T. Walsh rounds out the cast as this film becomes darker as it progress, and more serious are it tackles real life issues concerning racism and the propaganda spun from the towns people who rather not change for the better. It's a well rounded movie that really hits the mark on what its trying to say, and its probably one of the best movies to come out in recent years.",Pleasantville
396,chileorgullo,Do not waste time on this movie.,2,15 April 2005,"This movie was awful. It made no sense. It strayed from one plot line to another. The characters were unbelievable. If you have never seen this movie. DON'T. You will have wasted 2 hours of your life better spent watching whatever was on the WB network. The only thing that would have saved this movie would have been if Tobey Maguire would have been bitten by a radioactive spider, but it wasn't going to happen in this movie. Or if at the end of the movie, Reese Witherspoon was on her way to Harvard. What was the message of this movie? Have sex, see things in color? Or old TV shows need more sex scenes? What did Malcolm's mom have to do with anything? Awful.",Pleasantville
397,jacodes,Fine but not great,6,7 July 2005,"I watched this movie for the first time the summer I got my high-school degree, in 2002 (I was already too old for what I think being the real target of this movie). I found the first half of the movie quite boring,much better is the second half where the plot becomes more complex and reaches its climax.I think this movie definitely suits more with American teenager taste rather than with the European teenager one. However the movie is not pointless, its criticism over some of the attitudes which characterized American society during the 50's is carried on pretty well, even though sometimes the director overdoes the sense of the plot becoming in several spots dull and tedious. I dislike Maguire (Bud) in his role of the wise and sensitive boy, while Reese Witherspoon (Mary Sue) was just fine in her seductive girl role.",Pleasantville
398,qtisabel,This movie was awesome!,10,25 June 2005,"This movie was a wonderful adventure about two siblings that don't get along, and soon find themselves in a new town, wearing new clothes, and what not. One sibling is popular at school, and the other is a total nerd. They soon find themselves in a 1950's school where people dress, and socialize differently than their used to. As much as I would love to give away the end of the movie, I'd rather have you guys see it yourselves because this movie is a comedy, and a dramatic one at the same time. The reason I liked this movie was because I love everything about the 50's, including the music, the clothes, and just their way of life. If you love a good movie that you can relax to after a long hot bath and after being smothered in lotion, than Pleasantville is right for you! I give it a 10!!",Pleasantville

400,benecjt,Why I hated this movie,2,6 October 2005,"First, I must say I liked the concept... how things were in black and white, and they slowly turned to color. I thought it was a novel idea.But I hated the message it left. It starts off giving you the feeling that times were better back in the 1950's than they are today - no aids, teenage pregnancies were much less a problem, the big problem in school was getting caught chewing gum in the classroom, etc. But then the movie betrays you. It mocks the 1950's, the ""Father Knows Best"" lifestyle of that era, and - somehow - tries to sell you the idea that we are better off today. Apparently, in the writers' minds, the civil rights struggle eclipsed all of the good things that the '50's had to offer. Well, I am not a racist or segregationist, but I cannot buy that line. With drug and alcohol abuse, sexually transmitted diseases, teenage pregnancies, and the disrespect teenagers have towards authority, I would take the '50's back in a heartbeat. This is sending a bad message to kids. A very immoral message.About the same time this movie came out, another movie was released called ""Blast from the Past"". Like Pleasantville, that movie highlighted the differences in our culture between the '50's and the '90's. Unlike Pleasantville, it did not mock those traditional moral values. On the contrary, it portrayed Brandon Fraiser's character as being well bred, well educated (as a home schooler), and with respect and admiration toward his parents. How often do you see that on TV or in Hollywood? I would recommend that movie over this one, hands down.",Pleasantville
401,UncleBatman,Pretentious and Predictable,2,29 August 2006,"Thanks to a TV repairman with dubious motives, two modern kids are zapped into an extremely dull caricature of a 50's sitcom. In the town of Pleasantville, the worst thing that ever happens is a cat getting stuck in a tree. (What ELSE would the fire department do all day?) The girl (Reese Witherspoon) immediately begins to tear things up. Though the boy (Tobey Maguire) initially likes things the way they were, he begins to change his mind. (SURPRISE ... NOT!)The town starts as black and white, though as things begin to change (for the better, according to the director), color appears. Kids begin having sex and become colorful because they have changed their way of thinking. (Why the girls never get pregnant is a mystery.) Tobey's mom gets colorful after a one-night stand with Jeff Daniels, and Tobey gains color after confronting a conservative stereotype bent on persecuting her. Reese gains color not because she's running around with all the guys like a ho (that's what she did before), but because she starts reading books.BIG SPOILER HERE: The entire town gets full Technicolor treatment at the end! Actually, that was only a spoiler if you somehow failed to figure out halfway through what would happen at the end.Of course, we're not supposed to see what a wreck our protagonists made of the town.",Pleasantville
402,miovan,A wonderful film with more depth then you see at first,10,17 November 2006,"At first, the plot seems quite obvious and not a whole lot challenge you. But as the film progresses, you realize there is more to this film then the complications of traveling from the 90's to the classical 50's. I loved this film and was stunned by the depth it showed. It was surprising, but I can understand that some might not see this. This is also a good feature with ""Pleasantville"". It works very good (Specially with the acting of the wonderful Reese Witherspoon) in one level, but it can take you up another level as well, if you choose to be receptive to this.It is definitely worth seeing, since it all blends together perfectly. Acting, sound, picture and context makes for an experience. Joan Allen portrays Betty Parkers silent questioning and discovering in such a heartbreaking way. She and Reese Witherspoon (Who plays Jennifer) almost makes the whole movie worth watching just because of their incredible acting.",Pleasantville
403,Pete-6,What a shocker!,10,19 December 1999,"This is one of those lovely films that gets you feeling quite smug and makes you think you've seen it all before, then changes the script, gets you caught up in some beautiful characterisation, and leaves your jaw on your lap, as the movie becomes more and more gorgeous!The teen comedy that leads you in, takes second place to a fable about perception and the nature of reality; a lesson on the importance of identity and self expression; and a political message about how easily the bigotry that plagued WWII and the McCarthy era could come back and haunt us.Always entertaining, but addressing the audience on so many levels, this is a must-see movie!",Pleasantville
404,Gampy,Truman Show did it better,6,23 October 1998,"Despite outstanding acting by Tobey whatever and Don Knotts and the always reliable Bill Macy, Jeff Daniels, Joan Allen and (surprise!) Don Knotts, what stands out is the clever story which really didn't make it. A friend fell asleep (he often does). It might have been more interesting had not The Truman Story been there first, even though there was little (but SOME) similarity in the plots. Especially good were the spots of color when the rest of the scene was in black and white. The NY Times reports this was accomplished by filming in color (as opposed to adding color to b&w). Worth seeing? It depends on what else there is for you to see. Or you may prefer to see this in video. It lasts 116 minutes and you DO feel it. Coming Sunday: Beloved, which friends who have seen it call ""very dark."" Is that a pun? Oh, and they say (as Siskel & Ebert did) that it takes a few times to understand the story...or one reading of the book and two viewings of the film. --Terry",Pleasantville

Those clinging to black & whitedefined their world in those terms.  Thus, I saw some strongsocial commentary here, but above all, it was hum",Pleasantville
406,Wagner-2,"Breathtaking, Excellent",10,29 March 1999,"""Pleasantville"" was an amazing film to watch. From the scene where Tobey Maguire's real world character was ""talking"" to the girl, it was definitely wonderful. The directing was interesting, and the effects were certainly cool. Several scenes were memorable, such as the first burst of color, the first fire, the first rain, and especially the picturesque view of the colored rainbow and trees (or something) against the black and white town proper. Breathtaking.The film works on many levels of interpretation; finding out what they are was fun. The premise was unique (to me, at least), and the acting was superb: Reese Witherspoon was wonderful when she first appeared as Mary Sue, her emotions a mixture of wanting to go back home and staying to get hooked up to the basketball player (whose name escapes me). William H. Macy and Joan Allen were both fantastic, as well as Tobey Maguire and Jeff Daniels.What escapes me is why the film wasn't nominated for more Oscars, or that Randy Newman's fantastic score didn't win. Also, here in the Philippines the film was rated G, despite the whole sex thing (as well as Betty's, um, self-discovery).It's a pleasant movie to watch.",Pleasantville
407,armyguy,"In a word, Pleasant",10,24 October 1998,There are a few films of this caliber this year (The Truman Show and Saving Private Ryan being them).

One of the Best films of 1998.,Pleasantville
408,KWells,Pleasantville is a pleasant surprise!,8,27 October 1998,"From the previews, I expected this movie to be a lighthearted fantasy of what would happen should a 90's teenager be drawn into the b&w world of Leave It To Beaver/Father Knows Best.  While this is true, what follows is a well written, thought provoking and heart-warming film that lingers with you after you the lights come up.  I truly enjoy it when a movie not only entertains you, but also gets those brain cells working.  Now, don't get me wrong, don't avoid this movie because you want light entertainment in an effort to get your minds off of things, it can be that for you too.  It's just an added bonus that such an entertaining movie can tickle a few questions up.The general plot of the movie is that two teenagers, David and his twin sister Jennifer, are drawn into David's favorite television show, Pleasantville.  While this fulfills David's fantasy, it is his sister's nightmare.  David tries to conform and maintain his roll as Bud, but Jennifer just can't help but be herself, causing a ripple of change to spread throughout the town.Screenwriter Gary Ross who also wrote ""Big"" and ""Dave"", once again creates characters you can both identify with and enjoy watching.  Taking you on a journey that is delightful and unpredictable.  If you liked either of Gary Ross' other movies, you'll enjoy this one as well.With the impressive cast, the acting is, of course, first rate.  Joan Allen and William H. Macy as the twin's b&w parents, show off the reason why they've been nominated for awards and Reese Witherspoon as Jennifer is intriguing to watch.  Though at first, Tobey Maguire is a little annoying as the squeeky-voiced nerd David/Bud,  as the movie progresses, he really improves and becomes quite endearing.Now, let's not forget Pleasantville's incredible digital effects.  While the effects in this movie may not be as dramatic as those in ""What Dreams May Come"", they are nonetheless just as impressive.  One scene in particular featuring Joan Allen is quite striking where David/Bud helps her apply b&w makeup to cover up her colored face.  How'd they do that?So, after a summer filled with big-budget explosions and flying fists, Pleasantville is a refreshing change, and well worth spending the money to see on the big screen.  Don't let it pass you by.",Pleasantville

As a matter of fact the first hour is pretty good-what with its technical wizardry and light campy comedy. Unfortunately, it ends up trying to make many statements about our culture. It becomes overly judgemental and shows the characters of American situation comedies as hidden fascists. There was nothing deep about these characters, and that's the way they're meant to be remembered - as giving us moments of light entertainment. We end up getting lectures by an eighteen year old who knows more than everyone in the town put together. What he doesn't get is that that was all there was. If you try to analyze a joke too much, you lose its meaning.",Pleasantville
411,ghartman,Not much better than The Truman Show,7,26 October 1998,"If you liked The Truman Show (which I did not think was so brilliant), you'll probably like this film as well. Best scene is the attack on the soda shop with its 60s civil rights movement iconography.

412,gtapolow,"So close to perfect, just a shade off...",9,26 October 1998,"Pleasantville has to be one of the most original concepts since the Wizard of Oz. Take one geek mix in a twin who is a slut and you have the perfect setting for extreme behavior modification.Plunged into the ultimate 50's paradise our heroes try (sort of) not to upset the very balance of Stepfordian glee. However, as each character finds that certain something that gives them life, we see it come out in full colour.The first 2/3rds of the movie are stellar and rank among the best written and directed pieces out there. The effects do _NOT_ overwhelm the plot.Unfortunately, the plot does get overwhelmed towards the end when the movie turns to social and racial commentary pitting 'normals' vs. 'coloreds.'Mind, you. It's not the attempt on commentary that brings this film off the top mark, only its execution; which becomes haphazard and uneven.Nonetheless..A must see! GAT/fqa",Pleasantville
413,Octavian,"Good film, could have been great",7,31 October 1998,"What keeps ""Pleasantville"" from being a great movie is the heavy-handedness of the last segment of the film, particularly the trial scene and its aftermath.  The film's moral, that we should accept the world in its diverse and flawed beauty rather than seek security in conformity, should have been obvious by that point to any viewer who was paying attention.   Despite this flawed ending, there is a lot to like in the film.   First off, the cinematography is beautiful- the blending of color and black-and -white is simply astounding.   There are some fine performances here, notably William H. Macey as the sit-com father who must face his fear of change.  There are many fine moments in the script, and much of the early part of the film is quite funny.  Overall, I would recommend the film, with the caveat that the last 15 minutes or so can't maintain the quality of the rest of the film.",Pleasantville

415,BlaineD,Great biblical and social allusions.,8,31 October 1998,"I especially enjoyed where the movie alludes to Adam and Eve in the garden of Eden, the civil rights movement, book burnings, etc.  The black & white and color effects added to the film rather than detracting which is the definition of a good ""special effect.""",Pleasantville
416,GBailey-2,Emotionally Satisfying,8,25 October 1998,Pleasantville is not a perfect movie but it will do until one comes along. Gary Ross has a Capra-espue love of humanity on par with Robert Zemeckis. On both a technical and emotional level this film sets its sights high and succeeds.  Probably the most emotionally satisfying journey since The Shawshank Redemption.  This movie lifts the spirit while entertaining at the same time(something the conservative moral watchdogs of our time fail to realize is necessary to get their points across).  The cast is top notch all around(even Don Knotts)and the little touches such as the colour reflection in a black & white window are a joy to behold....See This Movie!,Pleasantville
417,sebring,"Good casting, good special effects",9,26 October 1998,"Very enjoyable movie, although it was a little too long. I especially loved the cast, from Don Knotts as the TV repairman and Joan Allen, always luminous and totally underused in most roles. Her eyes convey so much pain.

On one hand, we are told a `Pleasant' world where everyone is comfortable with their lives is not as viable as a world colored with teenage sex and adultery.  Yet, on the other hand the instrument of change (one of the main characters) ended up deciding to stay in this now improved, but still, fifties world.  Her words, `I've done the slut thing,' are ironic as her doing her `slut' thing was what lead to the supposed improvements in Pleasantville.  Another theme in the movie is the use of the term `Coloreds,' and how it relates to the supposed bigotry of `Pleasantville.'  Please.  Is this producer really trying to compare a bewildered town's anxiety with its population sudden randiness with that of the atrocities of the Civil Rights Era?  Finally, why do the producers of this movie believe there are no words in the books of their town?  Weren't most classics written prior to the fifties?

420,NEWKID,Almost a great film.,7,23 March 1999,"Although the acting of Maguire,Macy et al was great I think that Gary Ross, the director and writer of the film, must take responsibility for Pleasantville being ignored by the Academy.  What was shaping up to be an excellent satire was ruined by a stupid pointless ending.  Are we really supposed to believe that Jennifer's(that's the slutty one played by Reece Witherspoon)whole character is to change because she reads one book?  Also what about the real world mother will she not notice that her daughter has vanished off the face of the Earth.  I am afraid that it is oversights such as these and the overstatement of racism that ruins this movie's Oscar chances.P.S.  Did anyone else think that the masturbation scene was a little over the top for a movie rated 12?",Pleasantville

But there are times when it seems to go beyond that simple explanation. Maybe I'm seeing things that weren't meant to be there, but equating anyone who resisted change with fascists? Seemed a little far fetched to me. And did anyone else notice that there were no consequences for people's actions?

PLEASANTVILLE tries to address too many issues and leaves too many important points unfinished and unexplained -- you'll leave wondering why the '90s mom doesn't notice her daughter is missing and where, in fact, the real Bud and his sis disappeared to when they were replaced -- but will still take your breath away and make you ponder not only the plot but ""How'd they do that ?!""  Especially notable performances by the actors playing Betty and Bud; the latter amazingly seems to realize that every phrase he emits is too incredibly pithy and insightful for a no-longer-nerdy high school senior yet gracefully accepts the challenge.

426,banzaisi,The moral of the story,7,14 March 1999,"I think the most poignant moment of the film was the last five minutes, after Bud had been in PleasantVille and got back home, and realised that there was no such thing as the ""right way to live"".However, this moment comes after two hours of excellent screenplay, in which we are drawn into the hidden desires and personalities of the residents of PleasantVille.An excellent film, with thought-provoking material to be found at all levels; do the stunning special effects need to be mentioned?",Pleasantville
427,tv8,Let's talk about it. Shall we ?,6,15 April 1999,"Can somebody please tell me what this film is about. Is it a technical spin-off of Spielberg's little red colored girl in Schindler's List, is it a new version of Adam and Eve banned from the Garden of Eden, is it a film-theoretical analysis of the early sitcom, or is it just silly entertainment? My idea so far: a little bit of all...and in the end completely nothing!",Pleasantville
428,bmovies,"A Truly Magical, Interesting and Wonderful film BUT.....",10,16 October 1999,"Two 1990's teens, David and Jennifer, living unhappily dysfunctional lives, gets magically transported into Davids favorite 1950's Black and White sitcom, Pleasantville where they turn the world upside down for the residents of the fictional town by introducing many 1990's things (slang words, culture, sex, etc.) into the Pleasantville's 1950's universe which in turn changes people, plants, even inanimate objects into color.I identify with David in that I too was brought up (I'm in my early thirties now) in a dysfunctional family, only a thousand times worse than his, and I also sought an escape from that by watching endless syndicated re-runs of all kinds of classic tv shows (where life was perfect, people were happy, people loved each other), to the point where I had every line and every piece of useless trivia memorized from all of those shows. And, just like David, I too wished I could warp back in time to live in a simpler and more innocent era (and/or to be transported into my favorite classic tv sitcom).
C'mon, be honest. Who among us hasn't wished that? I think that most of the reviews here bears me out on that. The enormous majority of positive reviews always mention the first half of the film with absolute delight while barely mentioning the second half of the film. The negative reviews harps on the second half of the film, barely mentioning the first half.
To watch David and Jennifer warp into a 1950's sitcom and have to live in it as if it were real life was quite thrilling. Oh, the possibilities! This movie gives one an idea of what that would be like. It kind of fulfilled that fantasy of mine to go back in time, to LIVE in one of my favorite sitcoms as if it were real. I truly wish that part of the film was a little more played out.  I found it quite funny for David to know everyone, everything, every nuance about the tv show which made it easy for him to get along with the program.David/Bud and Jennifer/Mary Sue are walking down the street on their way to school:Mr. Simpson: Hello Bud!David/Bud: Hello Mr. Simpson!Mr. Simpson: I hear your father has a new car.David/Bud: Oh yeah, a Buick. It's swell.Mr. Simpson: Great!Jennifer/Mary Sue: You know that guy?David/Bud: Yeah, he owns the Hardware store.But Pleasantville, which starts out as a comedy/fantasy film, changes gears midway and turns into a sociological/political argument against the fifties and against any modern day romanticism of those years which almost ruins the movie.  After all, a movie is supposed to provide entertainment and what better way to do that than to let us live out our fantasies vicariously? The film lets us do that for just a little while then does an about face and trashes our fantasies, and by extension, trashes those of us who look back on the past somewhat nostalgically. When it comes to the fifties, there are things we could have done without: segregation, the cold war, McCarthyism, etc. But there are some things that they were doing so right back then (lower crime rate, lower illegitimacy rate, an educational system that was the envy of the world, fewer divorces, more two parent families and fewer single parents, a healthy respect for religion, children and teenagers treated their elders with more respect, profanity wasnt a part of the everyday language, a Hollywood that was still producing mostly family friendly movies and tv shows, etc.) that we are doing so horribly wrong today.I wouldnt change parts of the film where David and Jennifer introduce and teach the residents of Pleasantville how to do things differently in their day to day lives (except for the sex parts which this movie wouldn't have suffered without) thereby introducing color to the town, but at the same time, I would have done it without having to attack a person's beliefs. The saving grace of the second half of the film is that Jennifer learns something from the towns simple ways, discovering that there are more things to life than her 1990's sluttish ways (like reading a book of classic literature) and becomes enchanted with the 1950's more innocent ways.The special effects are incredible. I liked the crowd scenes of Black and White people mixed in with ""colored"" people. The scene in which David/Bud and Margaret (the both of them still in Black and White) are driving down a road in a yellow 1950's convertible car while pink petals are blown all over the place, simply took my breath away the first time I saw that scene. And after multiple viewings, it never ceases to please the heart and puts a smile on my face. It simply has to be the most beautiful scene ever filmed. My only criticism of this scene is that it is too short. I wish it were a much longer scene.In spite of the heavy handed parts of the second half and in spite of my own minor criticisms, I truly love this film and I highly reccomend Pleasantville. (I only wish that Pleasantville Producer/Writer/Director Gary Ross would have stayed off his soapbox and let us enjoy our nostalgia)",Pleasantville
429,cbt@h2o,I was not appreciative,1,10 August 1999,"I was very disappointed with this movie.  It was too explicit.  If it was going to be bad, they would have had more hints of that in the previews. I was very sad that it had to be so sexual.  My friends and I had to walk out of the theater because it was so bad!",Pleasantville
430,Mary-52,a visual masterpiece,9,16 April 1999,"Pleasantville, directed by Gary Ross, was a beautiful ride through time. Not only was this film well acted and well directed, but it had a remarkable story line and it was visual perfection. This film integrates color into the picture with absolute technical mastery. It is almost like The Wizard of Oz when the color literally explodes out of the screen. Prejudice and racism are dealt with as well throughout this film. The people who remain black and white will not allow the people who have turned color into their businesses or drink from their water fountains. These ""colored"" people cannot help the way they look and they are suppressed by the rest of the ""black and white"" society. The end of the film pulls everything together when two colored people are on trial and they manipulate the rest of the town to turn colored. I love the fact that nobody can turn color until they find something that they are truly passionate about, whether it be sex, art, music, or literature. Overall, this film is a true visual masterpiece with a new and interesting story line.",Pleasantville
431,skapoko,Great! Except.....,10,25 November 1999,"This movie is great!  It is entertaining, funny, has wonderful acting, and an interesting story line.  I can watch it over and over again.  But when I do I always cringe at the high school scene with Witherspoon.  Now I can easily say that because that scene is at the beginning of the film it totally puts everyone in a bad mood.  I love the movie but that scene. Grrrrr. Dont you hate that?",Pleasantville
432,butzi,Too preachy by half,5,22 July 1999,"I just saw Pleasantville last night, ready to be taken in by a good comedy about our culture. What I got was an over-long movie which tries to take on the evils of the ""Moral Majority"" by preaching about artistic censorship and sexual uptightness. For my part, the movie had too few funny moments and too many vague generalizations about complex cultural issues.",Pleasantville
433,icez,An 8 out of 10!,7,22 May 2000,"Pleasantville - this is only one of the few films from which I have seen brilliance and entertainment at the same time. Gary Ross' film is evenly paced, ingenious and downright full of acting talent.It begins with a simple premise: Two teenagers from the modern era are transported into a 1950's sitcom. During their stay, their influences begin to spark a series of changes in the uniform community. This occurrence begins to disturb most residents and trigger a dispute among each other.Gary Ross' own screenplay is actually an excellent depiction of how a permanent community adapts to major changes. From monochrome to color and routine to decisions, Pleasantville explains how changes affect every single individual. Many in the film were confused and had a hard time to accept things brought about by changes. It was clearly seen in the film how a peaceful community transformed into a violent and segregated society as it clung itself together in ways to find solace and harmony.Moreover, Gary Ross' direction is a clever mix of brilliance and charm. He used several techniques, such as colored objects amidst black and white background or vice versa. His techniques are quite remarkable and astonishing, as most clearly seen with Toby Maguire and Reese Witherspoon's acting. Both give satisfying performances as the teenagers who introduced reforms into a predictable society.I liked the film, and how it ended, although it turned out to what I expected. From its comic opening to the tragic consequences displayed in the movie, Pleasantville is perfect for individuals looking for a movie with intelligence and appeal.",Pleasantville
434,Ichabod_Fletchman,A newer version of the good old days,10,17 May 2006,"*Possible Spoilers* The white picket fence, twin beds, and dinner on the table by 6. This is the way we like to think of the good old days. But did we ever think ""What if somebody shook the formula up. That's exactly what this movie does. It throws two modern day kids and throws them into the 1950's sitcom ""Pleasantville."" Luckily the boy, now known as Bud, is a huge fan and knows what to say and how to act. His sister, on the other hand, hasn't a clue. Bud fills her in and they realize that they've got know choice but to play along. But Bud soon discovers that the dream world and family he wished his own could be like is not as ""pleasant"" as he thought. his sister goes to the bathroom only to discover that there aren't any toilets. Why? Because in their perfect world, nobody ever had to. Pretty soon, things start to change. The star basketball player has sex and can't make a another shot. All of a sudden large beds come out for two!! And the biggest change of all when things start to turn into color. People experience new things and that makes them turn color. But there are still those who want things to keep pleasant. When Bud is persecuted for painting in color the whole city hall is divided between those in color and those who are still in black and white. I don't want to give away the ending but I will leave you with this thought: Our word my be unpleasant in many ways. But at least we have the choice for it to be so.",Pleasantville
435,crisianne,This movie makes me want to make my self turn color!,10,3 September 2002,This is a brilliant movie with an allstar cast! Toby Maguire was the perfect man to play the part; the boyish light in his eyes seems completely genuine through this movie that is much more than it seems.  Anyone who watches this movie intently should want to start seeing more color in their life.  I highly recommend!,Pleasantville

437,doughart,Any film that...,10,14 May 2002,Any film that can successfully sum up the transition from the 1950sto the 1960s while casting Don Knotts as God is bound to go over people's heads. It is unfortunate because this is really a wonderful film that probably would have been reviewed better if it had taken itself more seriously. The comment about the door always having been blue in the courtroom scene is missed by almost everyone but is such a wonderful summation of the films attitude about the changes it is examining. A must see.,Pleasantville
438,1ne,Thinly Veiled Social Commentary,4,16 July 2002,"So I sat through this movie and although there was a definitive feel good attitude throughout, reminiscent of fairy tales and family films...this movie just simply strayed into the realm of politics and social correctness. True, movies that try to rise above the screen should be praised for what they're trying to do, but when the motion is so blatant it just boggles the mind why they wouldn't come outright and say the things that they want to say in some other medium than to try to weakly conceal their commentary behind a feel-good flick. A major theme seems to be that sex adds color to your life, no matter what the potential repercussions. Pleasantville was so completely pleasant that kids can have rampant sex and no one suffers any consequences--only a little color. Or a woman can cheat on her husband and their only consequence is a little color and laughter. Come on. The movie seemed to really enjoy a portrayal of conservatism equals bland, boring and black and white while liberalism equals color and enjoyment. It took it to the level of some insane ""Do The Right Thing"" scenes in reverse where I was reminded of early south anti-Afro-American bias and hatred...but in this case it was the evil black and whites versus the good colored folks (referring to those people of Technicolor leanings). A few notes would be the performances of the entire cast . They were all simply astounding in their roles. Randy Newman's soundtrack was a bit upsetting, but then again that usually is. Without giving anything away, the ending was very flat. It seemed to me that the writer had no idea where he was going but he knew he wanted to make this social statement. With that accomplished, Gary Ross was stuck story wise, so you'll likely forget the last 20 minutes and remember the movie fondly or not. Simply put, I would tell persons to see the movie, you may even enjoy it...but don't let it desensitize you to the truth of reality. Like I said earlier, the feel good aspects of the movie may make it enjoyable for many, but that doesn't excuse the movie for what it's trying to say (and that quite poorly). You may think ""oh it is like real life""...just remember, in the real world, there are consequences, in Pleasantville, there's just color.",Pleasantville
439,thenutts,Pleasantville has come home to roost,10,24 October 2010,"A really great movie. Not only a great fictional story, but non fiction as well. Pleasantville has appeared on my cable system several times in the past few weeks and I have watched it almost every time. I was struck by the similarities between events in this movie and what we are experiencing today. There are some people who are able to change and grow easily in this movie, as there are in our world today. And then there are those who yearn for a return to the bygone days, with their ""traditional values"" and interest in the status quo. I was struck by the resemblance between the Pleasantville chamber of commerce and how they discouraged any sort of thought, and the Tea Party supporters that we hear all the time talking about their wish to reinstate those same types of traditional values. At least in the movie, those who develop the ability to think and feel emerge the victors.",Pleasantville
440,parisdv,"A ""pleasant"" movie",10,20 June 2006,"Pleasantville is a movie worth seeing. It is extremely charming and sweet. It shows how dull our world if it were just black and white. The set design is gorgeous and so is the cinematography. The acting in this movie is superb. This movie definitely should be on the list of to 250 movies. It is very well made. Pleasantville tells the story of a teenage boy (played by Toby Maguire) and his sister (played by Reese Witherspoon) who find a magical remote control and are transported into a black and white '50's sitcom. The town in the show is called Pleasantville. The people of Pleasantville are very limited in terms of life. They have not discovered many things yet, and the town lacks color. But when Bud and Betty (the boy and his sister) teach the people about things they have never experienced or know of before, the town becomes exciting and colorful.One of the best scenes in the entire film: The best scene is when Bud and Betty go to lovers lane. They are driving in the car as they see the world changing colors. Flower petals turn pink and fall from the trees. It is a gorgeous landscape and extremely pretty.Another of the greatest scenes is when Bud goes to his ""mother"" in the kitchen. She is ""colored."" He takes her gray makeup and paints her face with it to cover up her color. Then, she looks exactly the same as she did before. Her husband can not tell the difference.",Pleasantville
441,Peekie9,Worth A Lot More Than Given Credit,10,4 April 2008,"I very much liked this movie and found the analogy to Nazi Germany was very well done. The book burning scene and ""crystal night"" scene could have been taken right from Munich. Not to mention all of the scenes showing hatred against the ""colored"" people and how friends & families turned against the colored people. Then the courage of some people to save those who were being persecuted.The movie was a nice combination of romance, sci-fi & the problems of family life with a surprise ending. Not to mention the humor throughout, especially the scenes in the barber shop and bowling alley (""at least we are safe. Thank God we are in a bowling alley"").The start of the movie with a gradual transition into color was also well done. Finally, the actors & actresses did a very good job portraying the characters.It should have won a lot more than for just the score when Toby McGuire is relating how books work.",Pleasantville
442,sophie-rox,jaded technicolour,8,24 March 2011,"This film has been classified as a dramatic comedy, but I think that the humor content was not as high as it could have been and most of the comedy that was in it was ironic because of the era that the T.V show was based on. The film gains attention from it audience because of the different way that it was made. The film was made in the 90's but the T.V series that the main characters were forced into was based in the 50's in black and white. As the movie progresses and the characters from the naive and proper T.V series are slowly being corrupted by the real world attitude of the new comers, a gradual evolution from a naive black and white to a more jaded Technicolour begins and the consequences are not so pleasant (pun intended). This film highlights the way that life used to be lived back in the 40's and 50's where 'sex' was a mystery and most teenagers were innocent. This movie has magnified this innocents to make it seem as though no one ever did anything bad and in doing so made comparing the 90's where David and Jennifer (main characters) were from, and Pleasantville (where most of the movie is set) seem like parallel worlds, one corrupted with sex and drugs and one naive about anything deemed unpleasant. This film was well made, although I think that the writers should have explained why David loved the show 'Pleasantville' so much. I am under the impression that the character loved the show because his own family was falling apart; his mother and father were divorced, his twin sister hated him and his mother and her boyfriend were leaving town again. David wished that his life was like Bud's from 'Pleasantville' with a caring mother, an attentive father and a sister that didn't drive him crazy. I would recommend this film to teenagers, and grown up families (as it is not appropriate for young children). This film has good morals as it shows that when you take a risk or do something that is out of your comfort zone you can reap the benefits that courage bring, in this case courage brought the residents of 'Pleasantville' Technicolour. This film also shows how diversity can be feared. The residents that stuck to their routines and lived in a 'pleasant' hell (pun intended) stayed in black and white didn't approve of the colored people and many didn't want any association with them at all. Many issues of racism were raised in this movie, especially when black and white store owners made signs saying 'no coloured's' and separate but equal seemed to be implemented in the small town. Of course in the end right prevails and 'Pleasantville' opens its self up to the rest of the world.",Pleasantville
443,OneThousandThings,A great portrayal of clashing values,10,12 March 2006,"This film dealt with many issues: racism, freewill, art/literature and music in our society, and even used the Garden of Eden as a backdrop for the story but portraying it in a way that most don't usually think of it. What stuck out to me, however, was the director's brilliance portraying a circumstance of clashing values. The two clashing values in this film are free expression and order. The people of Pleasantville valued order before David and Jennifer arrived. These characters valued free expression and did not understand why they couldn't express freely in a town such as Pleasantville. As they expressed themselves freely, other people in the town began to do the same while the rest of the citizens tried to keep order. Change was considered undesirable in a town like Pleasantville, especially when it was rapid. Eventually most people realized that although it isn't desirable, change is sometimes necessary for a society to grow. Soon, the citizens realized that they had something in them that wanted to express. As this happened, the changing town seemed easier to deal with. The people of Pleasantville found that if they open their minds toward others and allow each other to be who they are instead of who society wants them to be, they will become not only richer in color but richer in any other way they can imagine.",Pleasantville
444,thelastplace,Need Info about movie,10,3 September 2005,"If anyone knows, was this filmed on location or a set. The town looks like Nelsonville, OH, where the movie ""Mischief"" was filmed. My hobby is to travel to movie sites(if possible) and I've been to Nelsonville, OH. What I like most about the movie is the way David(Toby McGuire) and Jennifer(Reese Witherspoon) change personalities with one another. She's cool and he's a nerd when they start and when it's over. Well, you know. The concept is cool, also. What we don't like when it changes, we try to stop from changing. The only thing that doesn't change is that fact that things change. We should all be as wise a David to understand that all change isn't bad, it's just change.",Pleasantville

J.T Walsh and Jeff Daniels, as well as the ever glorious William H Macy. This is a story that highlights the cruelty of bigotry and narrow-mindedness in a very unique way. The burning of the books because they tell the wrong stories and restricting songs and paintings because they are promiscuous.Gary Ross is an incredible writer that can spin a story so exquisitely. All I can say is that the time to watch this movie, you will not be disappointed.",Pleasantville
446,Kaelgrant,Classic Representation of the Flaws with Uniformity,7,13 April 2015,"Pleasantville with Toby Maguire is a perfect example of the flaws of being uniform and alike in every way. Pleasantville reminds me of the suburban expansion following World War II in which veterans retired to uniform, identical housing complexes. Pleasantville is a troubling reality of what it would be like to have little to no variation in character between persons. This movie is perfect in refuting the idea of similar being good. David and Jennifer embark on a journey with a magical remote into a show where everything lacks color and, overall, differentiation. A show David once very much enjoyed, Pleasantville soon becomes a repetitive lifestyle lacking genuine character and unique character qualities. David and Jennifer change Pleasantville into the enjoyable, sometimes devious lifestyle we all enjoy.",Pleasantville
447,Piercecat,Still pretty good.,8,14 April 2015,"I watched Pleasantville for the first time a couple years ago and I thought that it was pretty good to begin with. After watching it again recently, I can safely say that it still holds up.One of the things I liked about Pleasantville was how it was an allegory for the Civil Rights Movement. I thought it was pretty interesting how they went about the whole thing with the color changes and it took me a little bit to realize what the director was planning.Another thing I liked about it was how even though the characters in the show were fictional, you could tell that they were more than that as the movie continues and their characters get fleshed out. It made you feel like the world of Pleasantville wasn't just some TV sitcom, but a living breathing world.Overall I liked Pleasantville for what it was.",Pleasantville
448,jacobpatanellcc16,"Great movie, love the humor but history to it too",8,13 April 2015,"This movie was a great movie, especially the sense that it related to a teen movie in a way, having it based off high schoolers, and that the history of it was on point. Although I don't particularly like black and white movies, this one was a very watchable movie. The black and white of the movie is actually a huge part of the movie, it shows how they discovered color so to speak. This film was also very comical just because of the people original in Pleasentville and there naiveness to what kids nowadays is normal. The accuracy of a 1950s town in the movie was portrayed very well. Everyone was happy, fire departments were there for cats in trees, such prosperity, life couldn't get better. Personally, I loved this movie, and would watch it again, it's a different spin on most typical movies these days and would recommend it to most.",Pleasantville
449,calebdin10,Pleasantville review,8,14 April 2015,"Pleasantville is supposed to represent the perfect society. Pleasantville is a perfect society because of it's innocents. There is no conflict, sex, losing and there is no stress because every thing is easy. I do like the idea of the black and white image colors in Pleasantville in the beginning to represent the old times and the idea everything is straight forward and there is no debating. Which represents the time period because everything was straight forward and a routine. Then when the people started to change mainly by having sex they started to change into normal colors. Then the normal people started to attack and tried to get rid of the colored people. That in my opinion is one of the best connections to the real world in the movie. The idea that colored people which would be African Americans were hated just because of the color of there skin. The movie showed this without saying a single word about African Americans or civil rights and showed how wrong that is to judge somebody by there color of there skin. This movie had a lot of good connection and some very famous actors including Paul Walker. This is a good movie that shows history with out saying any facts about it.",Pleasantville
450,colinlambertx,A lot better than I expected,9,9 November 2018,"I watched this movie in a class, I wasnt expecting a lot, and it immediately hooked me and I loved it.
The film starts off like a weird 90s comedy, our two mains receive a magic remote from a magic TV repairman (who we never fund out anything about, whether that's a negative or a positive, I'm still undecided) and our protagonists are transported to another world (did I hear someone say Isekai?) and must find a way to get home and deal with thier situation.
This film manages to totally shake off any misconceptions about what it is pretty quickly, I was expecting a film about 2 teens who start messing with this new world and wacky hijinks ensue, and that happens, but minus the wacky hijinks
The show world starts off in black and white, and after an event, things start having color in them, and this is used as a visual metaphor throughout the entire film.
The special effects are incredible too, it doesn't seem like it would be, but the way the shots are composed and the way the colors are used are just stunning

The moral of the story, no matter how glib and well packaged it may be, is simple: the characters benefit from betraying who they normally are. Big whoop. How is this monotony and lazy storytelling entertainment? Is the advice of this movie for every woman to leave her husband? Is the use of color the best stimulus these people could come up with? This film is a waste of time and energy. I cannot even support the performances of the actors since they are ALL purposefully wooden and uninteresting.

452,CaliforniaCajun,Apples and Oranges,5,25 February 2006,"Comparing 1950s television programming to 1990s television programming is like comparing apples to oranges. The movie suggests that 1950s viewers would have liked TV better if it was more like the 1990s.What the movie doesn't tell you is that 1950s TV was different because the 1950s were different. Viewers wanted escape more than reality. Without the birth control pill, the fear of pregnancy was greater. The Civil Rights movement was in its infancy. TV was new. So was Rock and Roll. People were more afraid of Communism and nuclear attack. Kids said prayer in schools. One income families were much more common.All of these things had changed by the 1990s, and television had to adjust to the times.Trashing 1950s programming and portraying actors from that era as naive idiots didn't accomplish anything aside from making me mad.I gave the movie a 5 out of 10 because I enjoyed Don Knotts' performance and the 1950s sets in black and white were a nice change of pace from the movies I normally watch. I also liked the change of attitudes about the past on the part of Reese Witherspoon and Tobey Maguire as a result of their 1950s experience.I have the movie and watch it occasionally, but always find myself losing interest after Don Knotts is through.",Pleasantville

But I've seen Father Knows Best, Ozzie and Harriet, The Donna Reed Show, Andy Griffith, etc., all of which provided the black-and-white idealized fictions of American life that are the subjects of Gary Ross's movie Pleasantville.Why have I seen this movie about 15 times and watch it again every chance I get? I keep asking myself, if I had the same opportunity as David and Jennifer had in this movie, would I succeed in gently moving these black-and-white stereotypes of living human beings toward greater acceptance of life, self, and others? Could I help them see all the colors? I'd probably screw it up and make some unintended changes in the future as we have lived it. Could we avoid blurting out, say, that we survive the Cold War and that the Soviet Union ceases to exist - in 1991? Could we avoid talking about the Vietnam War and what a disaster that was? Should we mention the political assassinations of the 1960s, and Watergate? Maybe hardest of all, suppose we interacted with our parents, grandparents or other family members - would we have the strength to again see them as living people when we also know that they died during our lifetime?

456,Marilyn-3,I'd like to see the Director's cut!,7,27 October 1998,"Pleasantville is an ambitious movie. It approaches a wide range of rather serious themes. The most fully-developed and satisfyingly managed theme is that ""you can't go home again, or, forget the past, it wasn't all that great."" In the version that I saw, it seemed that a lot of ends were left untied. My husband and I both agreed that it seemed like the movie had been edited down from a longer version and not to its benefit. It's a very good movie, elegantly filmed and well acted. It suffers from either too ambitious an agenda, or too aggressive editing. I'd like to see the director's cut of this. I have a feeling that an extra 20 minutes to 1/2 hour of movie would take this from being a very good movie to being a really great movie.",Pleasantville
457,Dan-40,Pleasantville a Profound Look at our Unpleasant Future,10,25 October 1998,"Every once in a while, a film comes along that makes a profound statement -- or a disturbing prediction -- about the society in which we live and its culture. ""Citizen Kane"" and ""Network"" are examples. Well, add ""Pleasantville"" to the list. In this fascinating and troubling film, we learn how comformity and familiarity can breed fascism. We also learn the pleasure and triumph of free thinking and of striving to explore new possibilities. We also learn the rewards, and the price, of enriching our lives and encouraging others to do so. ""Pleasantville"" is much more than a spoof of '50s TV sitcoms. Viewers who consider it so are missing a much greater point. It's really about how we are condemned to a life of bliss on the surface, yet much deeper emotional blandness. We are condemned, that is, if we don't cherish individuality and dare to recognize our differences as our strengths and use them to better ourselves.",Pleasantville
458,bpiot,A wonderful social commentary!,7,24 October 1998,"The movie ""Pleasantville"" is a wonderful social commentary on the changing of attitudes. This movie did a great job of showing how change is a natural and necessary part of life. All the actors were brilliant and brought their own individual charm to the movie and the special effects are awesome. I recommend this movie to everyone, especially to those people who have a fixed definition of family values.",Pleasantville
459,binni,A Pleasant Surprise (no pun intended),9,9 February 1999,"Having seen a lot of poor movies recently I guess I was in for a pleasant surprise. That came last weekend as I went to see the premiere of Pleasantville.The acting is good, the story quite good and supplies us with a good amount of laughs, smiles and other merry reactions. My only regrets about the movie are when it turns serious seeking to outdo ""To Kill a Mockingbird"" and the fact that there were only about thirty people watching.All in all, very good value for money.",Pleasantville
460,Devron,Good but preachy and long,5,1 November 1998,"The first half of the movie was entertaining and thought provoking. The colorization effects were excellent. During the second half, however, it became too preachy and I no longer cared about the plight of the main characters. If 30 minutes were cut from the running time, it would be a better film.",Pleasantville

463,netra,A film that truly shows you the colour of life,10,23 May 1999,Pleasantville was a truly entertaining and enriching experience.  The visual effects were extremely well done and the message of the movie was something that we can all learn from.  The bottom line is that life is shaped by all of our experiences and emotions.  It ceases to move forward if we ignore or run away from any of them.  A definite 10 and a must see for people from 9 to 91.,Pleasantville
464,Kevin-72,1998 Best Picture,10,25 October 1998,"Now, I'm usually not too over-effusive with my praise of movies, but this film was brilliant.  My jaw was hanging open at every new special effects shot - one particular sequence of a car driving down the road towards ""Lovers Lane"" is quite possibly the finest cinematic moment this year. Granted, its a little sappy and gets a tad heavy-handed with the racist and Nazi symbolism, but this is a spectacular movie all around. I plan on seeing it again.I'm not sure it has the muscle to overpower ""Private Ryan"" and ""Beloved"" at the Oscars, but I predict it will garner a nomination...  it should at least be heavily considered.",Pleasantville
465,seefilms,Writer/First-time director Ross's bastardized version of Adam and Eve.,1,25 October 1998,"Pleasantville, which is extremely well crafted and beautifully acted, must also be categorized as one of the most irresponsible films of our time. Gary Ross, who previously wrote Dave and Big, both of which were excellent comedies as well as being timely moral statements, has now crossed the line.Not in filmic terms, but in morality.It's obvious that Ross is making a statement about the inherent freedom within everyone from Adam and Eve right down to people within the world of television.  This is a beautiful statement, one that should be lauded.  But it is also one that should be tempered with responsibility and reason.Tobey Maguire plays the proverbial Adam, a boy that loves everything to do with the 'pleasant' world of forties and fifties television, until he and his sister, Reese Witherspoon who plays the also proverbial Eve, are zapped into the television world of Pleasantville.In this world, everything is black and white, until Eve feeds the apple to an unsuspecting boy.  As his desire is aroused, color appears in the world. Soon, all the kids are doing it...literally, at the ridiculously named 'Lover's Lane'.  More and more color appears, and yet, strangely enough nobody gets pregnant.The mother of Adam and Eve, played by Joan Allen, is Mrs. Cleaver to a 'T', until her daughter teaches her about sex.  After having been taught, the mother proclaims that the father would never to THAT, to which the evil Eve says, ""There are other ways to find pleasure.""  To the mother, this means more than just masturbating in the bathtub.  She leaves her home and family without even speaking with her husband and the only after math that we see is that food is not on the table.In the end, the normal people of Pleasantville must somehow come to terms with the 'coloreds'.  But what of consequence?  The only true evil in the film comes by way of the males who refuse to partake in the world of color. They burn books, rape women, and are generally Hitler-esque.In Ross's world, color means free will.  The freedom to do whatever you please.  This is truly an amazing thing that human beings possess, but this gift we have is tempered by the fact that we have consequences for every action that we indulge in.In Pleasantville, there are no consequences.In the ancient allegory, when Adam and Eve were cast out of the 'black and white' Garden of Eden, they were sent into the world we know too well.  A world of hardship, but certainly a beautiful world.Nobody dies in Pleasantville before and after color appears, there are no accidents, no mishaps, with unprotected rampant sex comes no disease, no pregnancy, no remorse...no sense.  With the pleasure, there is no pain.Someone said, ""How can we know the sweet without tasting the bitter?""  Gary Ross will show you.Pleasantville is like the allegory of Adam and Eve cast UP from the Garden of Eden straight to heaven...  So why are we here at all?",Pleasantville
466,claudius-2,"good idea, bad script",3,11 October 1999,"Pleasantville started off fairly well, with a decent (if hackneyed) premise of being sucked into TV land...Then it continued with some shallow commentary on racism and individuality.  The writing came off as unbelievable (even with the outlandish premise) and the constant ""tying up of loose ends"" got real tiring after the fifth end was tied.This movie would have been decent with better writing and/or less time spent on gross overexposition.",Pleasantville
467,jpc7p,Pleasantville Defies Logic of Premise,1,12 November 1998,"Pleasantville, in essence, was a philosophical statement.  It argues that to live life properly, in color, you must listen to your inner desires and wants.  While this is a legitimate (yet disputable) argument to make, it fails to take its premise to the logical conclusion.   Essentially the movie was a contest between hedonism and order/traditional morality. This is fine, but such a game must be played by the appropriate rules of logic.   The concept that Pleasantville could flat-out endorse hedonism (with teenagers engaging in promiscuous sex) and maintain order is ridiculous.  The two are a trade-off.  *You cannot have both.*  The film does not recognize this fact.  The creators stray from the logic of their premise and in the end Pleasantville became a world without consequences.  This is even more illusory and illogical than the television world at the beginning.It could not even get its fundamental premise correct, yet it tried to offer commentary on such a broad array of topics as racism, woman's rights and Nazism.  It failed even more miserably at offering some sort of edifying perspective.  What was with the ""To Kill a Mockingbird"" rip-off?  Talk about trite!  I was ready to walk out of the theater.  That was a horrendous comparison.  These issues should not have been introduced at all.  They were not even introduced in an original format; the creators just re-hashed old, long-established concepts.  What's worse, they implied that individuals who prefer an ordered society (a society where you don't have to be afraid to walk down the street at night) burn books and segregate people!
If living in ""color"" means living in true happiness, perhaps the creators of this film should read some Plato, who argues quite convincingly that living a life simply for gratification of your desires does not make one happy.  It also does not create an orderly and peaceful society.  In fact, it does the opposite.  If you choose to endorse Nietschze's view that morality is relative and up to an individual choice, then take Nietschze to the end - that this creates a world without order.  Nietschze and Plato cannot be mixed-and-matched.Not only that, but the film insults individuals who prefer order and stability over rampant individual liberty and hedonism.  Those people are ""squares"" who don't really see things the ""enlightened way.""  The fact of the matter is that freedom v. order is a legitimate value choice.  One side has no right to criticize the other as being idiotic or stupid.Overall, I felt the film insulted my intelligence.  It tried to show me something which I know is obviously false.  Simple logic dictates this.  And it seemed to assume that I would buy it.  Having my intelligence insulted is one thing, but paying $7.50?  I'll pass, thanks.",Pleasantville
468,scott-69,I have a few questions.,6,26 October 1998,"Does ""cherishing individuality"" mean that teenagers should be having sex? Is it ""uplifting"" to see a woman cheat on her husband for no apparent reason? There might be a good message in this movie, but it was hidden behind a disturbing, liberal, ""if it feels good do it"" banner.If the intent of this film was to champion individual thinking and tolerance thats great. But why does sex have to be the catalyst for change? Does individuality have to mean the dissolution of morals?And in the end what do we take away from this film that is so ""emotionally satisfying""? Does the ""pleasure and triumph of free thinking"" make it any easier to accept divorce, broken families, teenage mothers and aids. All too often these are the products of Pleasantville's and Hollywood's free thinking.",Pleasantville
469,Sermik,A Sweet Story Painted on Film,7,26 October 1998,"""Sometimes we need to take a look back to see where we are going...""I know that line has been taken, but it fits so well.  This canvas on film is a true spectacle of today's technology without the monsters, gore, or such.  The way the attention to details and how the colours ""pop-out"" make this movie extra special. There were some areas that I would not agree too, particularly the sex-on-demand aspect of ""Mary-Sue"".  The acting was really well orchestrated.  Tobey took the lead rather well and Reese was captivating as she so wonderfully portrayed the 90's teenage slutty girl clashing in the classic family values of a 50's TV show.  And Don Knotts was none other than himself.  It was nice to see him on the big screen again. For such a plot, it was wonderfully crafted and sculpted, not ""corny"" as I was expecting.I'd recommend this movie to anyone (over 14) who wants to be taken away and could use an emotional up-lifter.",Pleasantville
470,lbn67,This movie was more than I expected.,9,23 October 1998,I went to Pleasantville fully expecting to laugh and be wowed by the colorful effects.  I did laugh a lot during this movie.  Several times my mouth was hanging open at the glorious colors on the screen.  But this movie also had a very good story to it and a great lesson about tolerance and learning to accept new and different things in our world.  I was blown away by Pleasantville and it is my early Oscar pick!,Pleasantville
471,Gort-4,Thought Provoking,8,24 October 1998,"In the year of the critically lauded ""The Truman Show"" Pleasantville turns out to be the better film in my opinion. It has its flaws, chiefly a surprisingly smarmy first half, but the film's tone goes dark about midway through which elevates it up from the realm of the juvenile into something interesting (unlike ""The Truman Show"" which I never thought was particularly interesting at any point). There are some nice references to movies like Do the Right Thing and Schindler's List in the 2nd half. Joan Allen is superb with her role as the mother, but,  even more importantly, the young male and female leads who carry much of the film are extremely good as well.",Pleasantville
472,Spab-3,"I've never seen a movie to be powerful on so many levels. See it tomorrow, but only if it's too late to see it today.",10,24 October 1998,"I absolutely loved ""Pleasantville.""  Everything about it is perfect....and the plot is riddled with attacks at modern society and values. ""Pleasantville"" is a satire, and allegory, and a metaphorical work all in one.  Bud, who I believe was played by Tobey Maguire, was a DeGaulle-Christ-King-Christ-Leary-Warhol-Moses figure, while his sister represented a force of change.  Though inclined to push for change in Pleasantville due to her alienation from those around her, she found that she too was not above change and soon found herself to be alienated again, but this time as the one of the innocent schoolgirls whose innocence she tried to destroy.  A masterpiece.  Don't miss it.",Pleasantville
473,Nate-23,This movie is inspirational,10,24 October 1998,"When I went to see this movie, I thought that it would be a comedy with an interesting situation plot.  I was wrong.  This movie has a ton of symbolism and a message that applies to every person who sees it.  I would highly recommend seeing this movie.  When I left the theatre, I left seeing ""in color.""  I think that's the best thing you can ask of any movie--to open your eyes to things you hadn't seen before.",Pleasantville
474,dane-5,A thorough delight,9,26 October 1998,"I saw this movie at its world premiere at the Austin Film Festival and again at a sneak preview.  I thoroughly enjoyed it both times.  It received a rare enthusiastic standing ovation at the premiere (the only one I saw at the fest that did).  There are several homages that the director included. Among those I recognized are to Citizen Kane, To Kill a Mockingbird, and Patton (the bowling alley scene: the scoreboard behind = the American flag in Patton).  I know there are more & would like to hear about them.",Pleasantville
475,Stan-32,Better than expected,9,25 October 1998,"My wife and I had high hopes for this film, and it exceeded our expectations. Some aspects hit close to home. The story holds a different escapist quality from most. Low-key special effects blend into the storyline instead of setting themselves apart from the plot. An example: How the library books react. We encourage others to see this special film.",Pleasantville
476,Mad Monk-2,Warm fuzzy feeling and quite a few grins in this one.,9,25 October 1998,"This film was just as I expected it to be -- funny, witty, charming, and wonderful special effects.  Reminded me a little of The Truman Show, in that it is a semi-parallel universe where the people are relatively clueless to the truth.  Both a good science fiction (other world) story and a ""human nature wins in the end"" story.  Warm fuzzy feeling and quite a few grins in this one.",Pleasantville
477,Perkins-2,Many Themes,7,25 October 1998,"This film contained a lot of smaller and interesting messages.

Powerful social commentary arising from ingenious direction.however....the framing is awful.

Funny, entertaining, and it makes you think.",8,1 November 1998,"Take a trip back in time to 1950s America where everything was wholesome, good-hearted, and nearly totalitarian. Pleasantville attempts to show us that too much freedom can bring about bad results, but too little freedom is just a gray, mindless world with nothing to look forward to. This movie wants us to live a little. Add some color to your life. Open your mind! There are many parallels to the Nazi book burnings and racial strife.

I figured that since the movie was about a 1950's sitcom, it would be alright.Boy, was I misled.I only saw the first 1.5 hours or so of the movie, because I walked out the second time that they showed naked people.  Much of the focus of the movie was on sex.I was misled, and I am hoping to prevent others from being so.  The film does make you think, and the cinematography was absolutely wonderful. However, for me, that wasn't worth all of the immoral things that were thrown in there.Don't see it.",Pleasantville

495,lauramll,Extremely timely,10,20 February 1999,"One thing that I think people are overlooking in their comments is the way that a film like Pleasantville mirrors what's going on in America today. Pleasantville shows how inevitable it was that the restrained society of America in the 50's would have to naturally give way to social change.   And when we look at today's politically correct society, which tries to make everything banal and harmless (much like a 50's TV show...) we begin to see the little bits of color peeking through the black and white, and we realize that it won't be long before the world we're living in changes into something that really will bring about racial and gender equality, rather than just give things a new name...",Pleasantville
496,wirehead,Provacative and Profound. Some viewers will not get it.,10,22 November 1998,"This film is a provocative and profound and is quite intellectual in a non-intellectual way. Some viewers, particularly those who see life in black and white terms, will not understand this film or find it boring. There is a lot of social and political  commentary but it is indirect. The film is a metaphor of American history form the 1950's to the present. It addresses conservative and progressive thinking, feminism, racism, diversity and sexism in subtle ways. People change to full color as they grow and their potential for free expression awakens in ways that often challenges the conventional.Some Generation X's may have trouble understanding this film. Many Baby boomers will love it because they were growing up during them 50's and understand the transformation that has occurred in the US.The brother in the film is cautious and conservative and admires life in the TV series. The sister on the hand is very daring and uninhibited. When the two are propelled back in time, the sister becomes the initial agent for change in Pleasantville. The brother is much more cautious and initially tries to keep things as they were. By the end of the show the son becomes the force that transforms Pleasantville into a modern town that has many possibilities. The sister in contrast chooses to stay in Pleasantville and matures into a better and more conventional person.This file can be appreciated at different levels. This is one of the smartest films I have ever seen. It is so smart that it will go over the heads of a lot of people particularly those die hards that still think Richard Nixon was a good president.",Pleasantville

It should have either stuck to the comedic beginning, or gone completely dramatic with real conflict and perhaps no solid resolution. The end was completely predictable and the second half of the movie was not even spent wondering how they were going to take you there.This would have been a fantastic movie had, say, people started reverting back to black and white because that was their very nature (or *something*, *anything* to provide some real conflict...like, what if they followed the Fahrenheit 451 references a little further). Either that, or stick with the jokes to make an amusing comedy/romance.All-in-all, I feel like it was money well spent, but it's not a movie I will remember in future years.",Pleasantville

The difference is that Pleasantville actually followed through with their idea and made an amazing work out of it.  The cinematography, script, and plot are all far and away the best I have ever seen since classics like Casablanca and Citizen Kane.  It is, quite simply, the best movie of all time.  The production company was stupid for not advertising it.",Pleasantville
501,lisaloeb,"A very unpleasant movie, with an ugly message.",1,6 September 1999,"The acting and the special effects were great, but that doesn't necessarily make it a good movie. The message it was trying to get across was very heavyhanded, pretentious, insulting, and very confused. The only consistent theme it seemed to have is ""change for the sake of change is always a positive thing"".I can see some of the positive points the film was trying to make, but these were overshadowed and outweighed by the pseudo-philosophy and blatant extremism of the director, who mixes up and muddles his message and isn't consistent about how and why things change to color.The movie doesn't show any negative consequences to promiscuous sex and adultery and treats them like acceptable things. The movie lost all sense of perspective when it started treating B&W versus color as black versus white. The writer obviously didn't have a clue that using more moderate subversions would have been more subtle and interesting than using aggressive provocations which might have gotten people killed in reality. The movie cops out on a lot of things like that. The ""enlightened"" revolutionaries are never forced to question the consequences of their actions.The most disturbing thing about this movie is the contempt and hatred it seems to have for innocence. The worst part was the scene with last B&W guy, when his innocence is forcibly taken from him, and we're clearly given the impression his humiliation from that is an amusing and laughable thing.Those people who think they're more literate and philosophically inclined should be able to infer what that subtext implies.",Pleasantville

However, this movie seemed like once the premise was created, played out excellently in the first half of the movie, it lost direction.  There was a great setup, but the creators didn't know where to take it.  They wanted to include a message, then let the message become so central, and so obvious and overdone, that it snuffed out the romp that the movie started with.  I'm not against having a message in this movie - I think it was important and relevant; however the ending was so maudlin and hard to swallow that I left the theater feeling overworked.",Pleasantville

One could argue that we have gone too far in the opposite direction; but I believe that one of the main points made in ""Pleasantville"" is: inherent in suppression of depiction of sexuality and other difficult topics is an underlying, unspoken, and largely unconscious intellectual fascism.  It is preferable to risk over-saturation, than to repress discussion in the first place. As the characters in ""Pleasantville"" become more rounded and human, influenced as they are by the 1990's aliens, they take on hue. As they become ""colored"" they suffer fearbased bigotry. It is only education which relieves their plight.",Pleasantville

508,Russ@RT,Visually impressive but somehow fails to deliver,7,16 May 1999,"An interesting concept which, if not wholly original, is at least well presented thanks to modern digital effects.The main characters of the film - including David & Jennifer (Toby Maguire & Reese Witherspoon) - seem very two dimensional, making the transition from black & white to colour less convincing than it could have been. The one possible exception to this is the attraction between Jeff Daniels and Joan Allen, which is wonderfully underplayed at the start, suggesting that before the arrival of the two 90's teenagers they had never really noticed each other before.It is not entirely surprising that the film has not been more successful commercially. It does not appear to have been very well marketed, especially the trailer which almost put me off seeing the film, and as a result has failed to capture the public's imagination despite receiving critical acclaim in the press.Overall, this is a film which could have been so much more and done so much better but at the end of the day is just pleasant.",Pleasantville
509,Evil_Roy,A very good movie.,8,24 October 1999,"I really liked Pleasantville.  I was totally absorbed by it from beginning to end.  The story was well written and flowed smoothly and evenly.  It was obvious some thought went into the writing of this film.  I will have to watch it again just to make sure I caught everything.  Gary Ross also co-wrote one of my other favorite movies, Big.  The effects were pretty cool, yet not overwhelming.  The story allowed for a few twists and turns, and for some unexpected character developments.  I would be hard pressed to find fault with any of the acting, let alone the film in general.  I cannot recommend this movie enough.  It is funny, thoughtful and inoffensive.

If you don't like it, you really really don't like it.  And if you do like it, you really like it very much.  Black and White.For me, I greatly appreciated this film.  The smooth transformation of the film from black and white to technicolor appropriately accompanies and enhances the transformation its characters undergo throughout.

When the two kids travel into the TV to help turn the town around, the fun just starts. As we progress into the picture, the players become colorized as they become aware of their surroundings. However, it is definitely heavy on the metaphors, especially at the scene in the courtroom. (See where all the colorized people are sitting)All in all, an interesting film to say the least. It probably would have won an Oscar except that it was released during the year of Titanic. Need I say more?",Pleasantville

514,injapan,Not What You Expect: A More-Than-Pleasant Surprise,10,11 August 2000,"A lot of movies, it seems, start out with an interesting concept, and then quickly degenerate into formulaic, unimaginative teenage fodder. ""Pleasantville,"" in more than a pleasant surprise, does the exact opposite. Using the same plot device seen before in much lesser movies, two children of the 90's get zapped into a 1950's sitcom reminiscent of ""Father Knows Best"" and ""Leave It To Beaver."" They suddenly face blending into a town where everything is in black-and-white, and everyone has charming, naive good nature. You expect it to get silly and go nowhere after the first few clever cross-genre jokes.Except that in this film, we get a big surprise: just when we expect the film to lose its charm, it becomes a far more intelligent, sophisticated and beguiling film than we thought it could be. First-time director Gary Ross actually decided to go somewhere with the plot; we expect that the two modern teenage siblings (the nerdy David and his slutty sister Jennifer, played by Tobey Maguire and Reese Witherspoon) will slip up and in doing so reveal witty differences between the two time periods. However, Ross delivers his surprise not just in how the two modern kids react to an ideal, white-bread 50's-style society, but more immediately in how that society reacts to their hedonistic influences. As David comfortably fits in to a world he is more at ease with, his sister instantly rebels, taking teen-dream basketball player Skip (Paul Walker) to Lover's Lane, where she shows him how to do more than hold hands, and shocks him into a very human male reaction (""Skip, it's -supposed- to do that!""). But as Skip digests and accepts this amazing experience, he sees a single rose by the side of road in color-and everything goes uphill from there.What is truly most surprising in this film is the unexpected nature of the underlying messages about the two disparate time periods. In an age where middle America looks back in fondness and more than a little longing for those clean, innocent days of a generation forever changed and gone, we get an interesting mixture of commentary not just on what was wrong, but also what was right. Director Ross subtly builds his exposition based upon the metaphor of color, representing change. The primary message is that while the good old days of a utopian suburbia may have been pleasant, we paid a price for it; when everything is ""swell"" and ""keen,"" we avoid the very bad-but also we avoid the very good. Discord is not too high a price for the true joys of life.Along the way we are treated to some beautiful imagery and sly metaphors which catch you by surprise, from Eve giving Adam the apple to fascist destruction of art and literature-with just the right cast to convey the messages with subtle conviction. Brilliant actors such as Jeff Daniels, Joan Allen and William H. Macy recognized a good film and helped deliver it, Daniels as a kindly-but-dumb soda jerk who realizes a love for art, Allen as perfect housewife discovering a repressed desire for freedom, and Macy as a good-natured dad, not forcefully unwilling to change, but rather woefully befuddled by the passing of his ideal life. Add to that exceptional performances by J. T. Walsh (in his final role, as the hard-headed civic leader who fights the change) and Don Knotts (of all people! as the TV repairman who facilitates David and Jennifer's transference to Pleasantville).This is not to play down the performances of the film's two stars Maguire and Witherspoon, who help deliver the film's subtle message, which is not just portrayed in the changes to the fictional characters of Pleasantville, but is also represented by the changes in the two protagonists. David and Jennifer's initial states of chaste nerd and high-school slut (metaphors for the 50's and the 90's) blend into their final, sensible common state somewhere between the two, suggesting that there are good things about both eras. Not only does the film suggest that the 50's were too good to be good, it also tells us that perhaps we would be better for putting a little of that era into our present lives.",Pleasantville
515,anewtablet,A movie that infers that cheating on your spouse is 'cool',3,23 February 2020,I like the movie except the way it suggests that cheating on your spouse is 'modern' and cool when the wife screws with the soda shop guy.

516,paul_walker,Colourful look at American values,9,8 April 2002,"Just seen Pleasantville, which I absolutely loved - it looks like another one on the bandwagon following the success of The Truman Show, but it's much more than that - it's by the same guy who did Big (Tom Hanks is a kid in a man's body) and Dave (guy looks like the President), and uses a similar sort of vehicle to tell the story - this time two American teenagers end up in a 1950's sitcom, Pleasantville, and have to live the lives of two of the characters from the TV series. However, much like in Time Machine, their prescence upsets the delicate balance of nature and starts a snowball which no-one can stop. Lots of clever use of digital effects enable us to see both colour and black and white images on screen which is used extensively to portray the changes in this otherwise very homogenous and stable environment. Gary Ross uses this situation to talk about the role of society, rules, values, personal freedom and also looks at what would happen if we actually had the perfect idealised world we think we remember...It's beautifully shot and visually demanding with a huge amount of effort going into many of the shots to help tell the story. Reese Witherspoon and Tobey Maguire take the leads and are both great but special mention must go to Joan Allen, who plays their Mom and is mesmorising throughout. In summary, a fascinating study of life in America, both now and then, with some great comic touches and fine performances from the cast.",Pleasantville

I don't know of course if this was the intention of Mr. Ross, but I did get a lot out of the film.The film to me seemed to touch on several things all at once.  The biggest thing I think I got out of it, however was that to see the true ""colors"" of the world we need to enjoy life to it's fullest and understand ourselves and our society.",Pleasantville

By the time I found myself laughing hysterically, I had my own experience of awakening. When it steered rather cleverly into social commentary, I cheered for the scope of its thematic invention. As much as I loved Seabiscuit (also written, directed and produced by Gary Ross), I do feel this earlier film has even more heart and guts in it, and certainly plays with our imaginations by virtue of its very recognizable yet fictional world grappling with change.If there is a film I would love to show in a ""Jesus Camp"", it is Pleasantville.",Pleasantville

This was the first time I had seen her on the big screen and I knew from the first that she was a wonderful actress and was destined for a great career.

The basic plot, of two 90's era teens being transported into a late 50's era sitcom, and how their actions affect to world around them, and the people that they are encountering, is dramatic and fascinating to watch. On the surface, we ave a self discovery movies as two people encounter them selves through difficult situations, and open up to their own full potential as they open up the full potential of other people. However, as we dig deeper, we find that the people are dealing with some basic human emotions and struggling with identity shift, in very violent ways as their simple and unchanging world encounters the depth and rich color of emotions that are not tied down to expectations.I find that this movie is a must see for all people who work and live in social environments, and it tells how easily fear, and prejudice against the ""other"" can cause a Nazi like mentality to spread like wild fire.",Pleasantville
523,cary-31607,Great Film Written in More Enlightened Times,9,13 June 2021,"Towards the late 1990s, films were starting to point to a more positive direction where movies could themselves contain tragedy, yet spawn hopeful messages. A good comparable for Pleasantville would be American Beauty or even the Ice Storm. This theme is a lost distant art that is really needed in these divided and troubling social media times.This movie succeeds at the philosophical level in showing how change is inevitable and very necessary, because (1) a world that never changes would be be boring and (2) while change brings some of its own sets of problems, it is a natural residue of any free society, like the hot embers and suffocating smoke of a beautiful camp fire.Where the movie is at its best is lampooning and contrasting the late 90s or modern culture with innocence of a hopeful and conformed 1950s public. The scenes at the basketball court, the scenes satirizing the wife's role in the 50's and other scenes are simply brilliant well-executed comedy.The film is not perfect. The movie suggests that rhetoric alone permits change, yet this is a simply way to accelerate the plot to its inevitable conclusion, and not even close to any reality we are familiar with. Hence, Pleasantville does not wrap up in a neat and tidy bow and observant viewers are left with more questions than answers.Overall, however, the film is highly entertaining, makes some interesting and valid observations and comparison, well-acted and very funny.",Pleasantville
524,rexah-1,Discover your passion,10,18 January 2007,"I loved this movie. It totally spoke to me. It is all about discovering your passion in life.The movie is a great representation about how some people live life in the status quo, and others dare to go find what they are passionate about in life. The clash comes when the seekers come face to face with the status quo.When Toby Macguire and Reese Witherspoon enter Pleasantville, the town is completely happy with their existence. The fact that no one in the town knows what is outside of Pleasantville is so indicative of people that don't know that there is anything else in life other than their routine lives. When Reese begins helping the teenage boys in town discover their ""passion"" and Toby Macguire helps others discover their passion through art and literature, Pleasantville is turned upside down. Excellent movie!",Pleasantville
525,ahughes-9,the real point of this movie,9,25 January 2007,"The point of this movie is sometimes lost on people because they think it is either too simple a story or a story that lacks any real depth. The point of the movie (as far as I'm concerned and from listening to the commentary track by Ross on the DVD) is that life is never simple and life does not follow any set of rules that are found in the fictional town of Pleasantville. Rules can be made, but all rules are broken at some point or another. Some people don't need a movie to tell them that, but others like to be reminded that life isn't as simple as some want us to believe. There are rich metaphors in this movie and a great deal of symbols that you sometimes need to look for and other times are very straightforward. This movie doesn't preach as much as it entertains (if not just for the art direction) and I whole-heartedly recommend this movie as it is one of my favorites.",Pleasantville
526,doc_lomax,surprised by the film,9,18 February 2007,"I watched ""Pleasantville"" on cable after having seen Spiderman recently, so thought I'd take a look at Tobey in another role.It seemed at first to be such an insipid film. I was about to flip the channel . . .Until the color metaphor occurred.It soon became clear to me. Other things then unfolded. By the end, I was quite amazed at what I had just seen and had to think back through the film about some of the scenes.Pleasantville is an excellent film. The ""coloreds"" reference is powerful and anyone part of a minority might see and appreciate the point being made. You might have to watch it 2 or 3 times, as I did, to catch some of the gist.This movie is not Hollywood propaganda, nor leftist garbage; it is simply a story of how simplicity, conformity and no change can be stifling, if not stultifying. ""Color"" may be threatening in a way, but is part of the beauty of life.The film has a philosophical challenge to the viewers, to decide yes or no to the following: Change is good.",Pleasantville

528,missmelisssx3,i though this was a good movie,8,9 January 2008,i really liked all of the special effects that this movie had. i don't know how they made everything black and white with some colors. Reese Witherspoon did a really good job as Mary Sue. but she kind of seemed a little old for that part. Tobey McGuire also did a very good job playing bud. He really looked like a high school student. i thought it was really funny when he went to the firemen to tell them about the fire and he was screaming fire at them and they did nothing but when he said cat they got up and went to help.

The movie became more and more interesting as it progressed because everything was turning colors. It look weird to have colored people on a black and white setting.

533,jalon_dukes,Sometimes the best parts of ourselves are the ones we leave unexplored,9,26 July 2011,"Through the years, unknowingly really, I have developed into a ""movie buff"". With this being said I find myself intrigued and mesmerized with those ""deeper"" movies. By that I don't mean the ones about love altogether but one's that are past the mindless ""explosions-for-the-sake-of-explosions"" movies, but use symbolism to relate to the viewer, as well as conveying new ideas in a more thought-provoking manner. So I must say that I was ""pleasantly"" surprised with the film. The film begins with a teenager by the name of David, who let's just say does not have the greatest home life. He copes with this by seeking refuge in the 50's perfect world, portrayed in a sitcom called Pleasantville. His sister, Jennifer's character, however is contrary to his. She is wild and enjoys life's thrills, worries about her appearance, and how she is perceived by those around her. The film really begins to take shape as the two characters are actually thrown into the sitcom. In the sitcom, all the characters are black and white but as David and his sister bring imperfection to their world they begin to see colors appearing on certain people in the sitcom. It seems that things such as sex, violence, sadness, and other feelings that are not ""pleasant"" trigger the change in color.However, it is not the corruption that causes color in Pleasantville, rather it symbolizes when people live life to the fullest with a wide array of feelings, not just the good, but the bad too, ""all of themselves"". So when the black and white characters begin to experience some of these new feelings such as love they begin ""really living"". The beauty of the color as opposed to black and white also symbolizes the beauty in living life to the fullness. The symbolic reasons as to why people obtain color is perhaps best evident (as well as the 'courtroom scene', which was one of my favorite scenes) when David and his sister are one of the last of the main characters to obtain color. David obtains color when he stands up for his mother. This displays David exercising an unexplored side of his personality, where he generally is content with his life and what is happening. But his stepping out of his comfort zone causes him to live a fuller life. His sister obtains color when she reads a book and genuinely enjoys it. This symbolizes that the best parts of themselves, the parts they never knew existed were there all along and once you experience all of life, its beauty and majesty, then can we live full lives, and in doing so we may have to do things out of the status quo (as Bud and Mr.Johnson did when they painted the mural on the wall, knowing they would be persecuted and ridiculed by other members of the town). Another great use of symbolism is the ending when Jennifer chooses to stay in Pleasantville, while Bud chooses to go back to his imperfect world. This shows that Bud, although wishing he could live in Peasantville originally, realized that a perfect world has no surprises, no newness to it and that he should embrace his imperfect world, as he realized in his time in Pleasantville. He also realized that he should just live and not expect things to be a certain way and that life will be life and it was meant to be lived to the fullest of our potential and embraced. While, his sister though wild at the start and hated Pleasantville originally, found that the best part of her was her thirst for knowledge and new love of literature, something in which she never knew she had in her. Besides the great theme, and beautiful portrayal through various accounts of symbolism there were also wonderful casting done in this film, as well as wonderful performances particularly by Maguire, and Daniels. I would highly recommend the film to those in search of the ""deeper film""",Pleasantville
534,moss-laurela,Great movie on so many levels,10,15 July 2015,"I love this movie. It's been nearly 20 years, (1998) but it still holds up. Inititally, the premise seemed like it had been done to death. Two kids grab a remote control and are transported into the TV. Wackiness ensues, but Pleasantville is not a wacky comedy. It's a touching drama, with a little comedy mixed in. It mixes social commentary, artistic brilliance and pathos. In 1998, when it was made, CGI wasn't as advanced as it is today. I've wondered how they made it. The artistry of blending black and white with color in one scene is done to perfection in this movie. Without this effect, the movie would not be anything like what it turned out to be. The fact that it takes place in the 50's is somewhat relevant. In that time, it was about to become very turbulent. Things in the 50's weren't as rosy as we remember them, but that makes this movie all the more relevant. It's a visually stunning movie with great production, writing and acting.",Pleasantville

I know that sounds ridiculous, but if the idea of color in their world is so crazy, and foreign, how would they know how to identify it with names? Maybe the director thought that would be the simplest way to handle this subject - that they just knew what ""green"" was. I don't know...I think a better way to handle it was if they just said ""it looked different"".

536,croaton44,"""A Question of Values""",4,8 June 2005,"The plot of this movie is straight-forward: A modern-day brother and sister accidentally end up in a 1950s TV show called ""Pleasantville"". The film's agenda, however, is clearly to promote multiculturalism.In their present surroundings, the kids live in a neighborhood patrolled by security. Their mother is a divorced woman more interested in her own sex life than the welfare of her children. The ""cool"" kids smoke, do drugs, watch MTV, and sleep around. They consider David ""pathetic"" for being a decent young man.In Pleasantville, life is harmonious. Children are well-mannered. A family consists of a man, his wife, and their biological children. People are friendly and courteous to one another. With the arrival of the two teenagers, however, things change.Some parts of Pleasantville and some of its residents change from black-and-white to colored. The result? A grocer quits his job because simply because he doesn't ""feel like it"" anymore. Betty becomes selfish and belligerent; being a housewife is no longer good enough so she abandons her family to be with someone else. The tension between the traditional black-and-white residents and the ""colored"" residents soon comes to a head.The traditional black-and-white people want things to remain pleasant. The ""coloreds"" want to expand their horizons even though they know that things will become ""louder, scarier, and a lot more dangerous"".The black-and-white people are invariably portrayed as evil, dim-witted bullies. They gang up on a ""colored"" woman in what might have been a gang-rape had they not been stopped by her son. They riot and smash a window-front in a scene reminiscent of one forever burned into our collective consciousness: Germans destroying storefronts of Jewish-owned businesses. Not wanting to leave the ""African Americans"" behind, the director also places a ""no coloreds"" sign in an obvious attempt to remind us of segregation.A ""colored"" man, naturally portrayed as genuine and kind (never mind that he's with a married woman) spray paints the brick wall of a police station with graffiti. This ""artwork"" shows fires and smoke, couples having sex in cars, snakes, and the town hall sinking. The black-and-white ""bad people"" are at first outraged by the vandalism but quickly ""come to their senses"".In the end, the coloreds win. Somehow, I doubt that everyone lives happily ever after.In real life, the coloreds have already won - with more great treats in store. Mutliculturalism and race mixing are glorified by the media. This country has become morally bankrupt. Places that were once safe are now dangerous; even convenience store clerks have to hide behind bullet-proof glass. The decent, hard-working, white men and women who made this country great are maligned and any form of racism is harshly condemned. The only racists shown on TV are redneck buffoons shown on Jerry Springer.In times past, attitudes were a little more realistic: ""...

Never mind the huge leaps in crime, illegitimacy, divorce, and substance abuse...we owe a huge debt to those free-spirited boomers. Thanks guys!This film is a prime example of leftist Hollywood propaganda. It is dishonest and disrespectful, and anyone involved with its production should be ashamed of themselves. Would it be too much to ask to see Hollywood make a film that affirms traditional values rather than tearing them down? Apparently so.Besides, I'll take the Fifties-era entertainers over the current crop of strident liberal boobs any day. We need a new Frank Sinatra.",Pleasantville
538,ocbound84,A real cinematic treasure,10,8 December 2005,"I'm glad to see Pleasantville has such a high rating here on IMDb. This film is truly cult classic material; there is just nothing else like it anywhere in my opinion.All the people who are caught up in this film's plot holes, (and it does have a few, I'll admit), are missing out on the beautiful, as well as simple, message that this film is trying to convey. As put before, it is a real tribute to the human condition and the fact that ""nothing is as simple as black and white"". There is such a bittersweet truth to this film that I think anyone can relate to. It shows how much we truly fear change, but ultimately must accept it, because change is inevitable. Read between the lines and you are sure to find something absolutely profound as well as heart warming.If you are capable of suspending your disbelief a bit and simply accepting that there are some plot holes, I suggest doing so. Pleasantville really is a cinematic treasure that no one should miss out on. It leaves us with a feeling inside that not many movies of today are capable of doing.",Pleasantville
539,playle,Supercilious,7,20 December 2013,"David, what a supercilious Creep with that arrogant smile across his face whilst he is destroying his ""adoptive parents""lives & marriage all because he can! and introducing anarchy into society because he ""thinks"" that's what they want! It reminds me of certain country attributes? the no colored signs seem to be a reference to the coloured racial prejudice of that time, but to me it didn't work.At the beginning I was quite into it but as time went on i was getting more & more angry mainly at the face of the main actor David as he smiles his way thru with ""how good I am""? & returning to his mother to sort out all her problems. finally when he leaves his sister in the total mess he made, ah thats OK she's expendable -- at least she learns a lesson! BTW it was also good to see Don Notts there, even younger than he used to.",Pleasantville
540,gordongrant25,Is that all ?,3,2 December 2014,I've been hearing about this movie for years. We watched it last night for the first time and all I have to say is : Is that all ? The first 30 minutes or so looked promising but it soon became apparent that this would be still another 'Hollywood treatment' of a not bad idea. Everything was so predictable and as expected. And it seemed that it could not decide on an ending. The Reese W. part started with a bang but an hour into the story she had mostly vanished. Toby M was engaging enough but Joan A which I usually like very much was bland and grey even in full color ! I found the entire film juvenile and uninspired. Tedious !,Pleasantville
541,tashia1,how pleasant-ville criticizes pop culture,10,29 March 2005,"I was wondering if anyone could give me their views on how pleasant-ville relates to pop culture today? On how peoples influence change they way others think and act, and how if you agree with the fact that everyone wants to be just like celebrities and if we continue this way than there is no individuality? I believe that the movie dealt with the black and white people not wanting any change in their lives. They were closed to new things and new ideas. On the other hand the ""colored"" people felt free and felt as if they were new people and were happier for the change.This film hit on some very important basis, such as racism and segregation. For example in the courtroom the colored people were separate from the black and white people, just like back in the civil rights era in the movie theaters the blacks sat on the top part of the theater and whites sat on the bottom. Also the no colored signs in the store windows. I personally believe that this movie relates to todays pop culture by everyone trying to be something their not. Everyone needs to be their own individual. With out individuality there is no diversity, no change, and no character. If we were all the same we would be like robots, talking, moving, and acting the exact same way. Just like Anthem by Ayn Rand. Without change there are no new discoveries in the world. Without change the world is just a close- minded monotonous place to live.",Pleasantville
542,nmorgan95,7/10,7,13 April 2015,"A funny look at a made-up 1950's sit-com and how a brother and sister get literally sucked into the makeup of the show and begin to change the landscape of not only the city itself, but the values that dwell within. This movie is funny to start out with, and there are a couple of great performances, but this thing begins a downward spiral during the last 1/4 of the movie. It does a very good job establishing its agenda and message, being not to fear change and to embrace diversity, however it pushes it too far in the end, feeling too much like a liberal Hollywood production that pleads with you to be in awe of it. It is probably worth watching just for the gorgeous visuals that are on display, but the end of the movie in particular left me wanting more.",Pleasantville
543,garkengia,Why all the low scores?,10,22 June 2005,"I realize that my comment may be about 5 years too late, but I have read a good deal of the comments posted about Pleasantville, and I think that some people have been overly harsh. In my personal opinion, a movie is unlike a book in that there are many things aside from the symbolism or opinions expressed that have to be taken into consideration when reviewing it (for example, cinematography, lighting, acting, casting, soundtrack, etc.). When you see a movie, you may disagree with the message that the director is trying to force upon the audience, but giving a rating of ""1"" seems a little too stingy. If you want to get into an academic or political debate, I'm sure that there are a lot of people who would be willing to disagree with your point of view. However, you would be grievously mistaken to write all people with different opinions off as stupid. it is inevitable that people will disagree about things. The director of the movie obviously has a certain idea of what life should be like; whether or not you agree with that is your business. I understand the arguments that some have posed regarding this movie, even if I don't entirely agree with the assumptions that they have made. The difference is I don't write them off as stupid people (i wouldn't give you a intelligence rating of ""1"" just because i disagree with you). In any case, there are other factors to consider when rating a movie. People who gave a rating of ""1"" failed to mention any of the other aspects of the movie (for example, were you as displeased with the acting as much as you were with the writing?). In short, I loved Pleasantville. I think that it was entertaining, as well as thought provoking. At the same time, it appeals to many different audiences (much like Shakespeare did). I think that this is the mark of a good film. Even if you disagree with some of the ideals that are presented in the movie, you would be hard pressed to criticize the soundtrack or cinematography of Pleasantville (not to mention the acting). Personally, I wouldn't be willing to spend time writing a several paragraph review of a movie that only got a score of ""1"". It simply wouldn't be worth my time. In my opinion, a ""1"" would be a movie with no redeeming qualities that I could not watch start to finish. I seriously doubt that this is the case with people who gave Pleasantville such a low score. If you have not seen Pleasantville, do so now. It is definitely worth watching once, if not many times.",Pleasantville
544,jking-49637,Overall good movie,9,5 April 2015,"This was a fantastic movie. It portrayed the way people felt about colored versus white people. The movie was upsetting because the people who were colored were embarrassed about it at first and were bullied because of it. I found it clear to see that the introduction of color into the movie was indicative of an overall change in the attitude and morals of the inhabitants of Pleasantville. Because of people changing to have color instead of being black and white made the town very segregated. Excpecially in the court room, this portraits the many court cases that happened in real life. For example, Brown versus Board of Education and Plessey versus Ferguson. However, as they changed to color they also became more accepting of differences.",Pleasantville
545,onur_mengi,Great Movie!,10,15 June 2015,"Pleasantville is by far one of the best movies I have ever seen and does not get enough credit for being such a good movie. Though it may seem like it, Pleasantville has really nothing to do with the old shows you see. It puts two kids who from our world who would be normal and throws them in to a ""perfect"" world that knows no real pain or war. These two kids change the lives of the people they interact with, and also get new perspective on their lives too. It is a movie that you have to mostly watch for the deep meaning behind it to actually enjoy it. Although I watched it twice before really seeing the movie for what it was, I think it is a great, meaningful movie.",Pleasantville

547,ninabourlet,A wonderful experience,9,10 November 2016,"Pleasantville is probably one of my favourite films. It's an American fantasy movie released in 1998 that tells the story of two teenagers living in the nineties who accidentally enter a fifties black-and- white sitcom which takes place in a town called Pleasantville. In this « utopic » place, all the people are perfect and innocent, but the arrival of the two teenagers will completely disturb the life of the inhabitants.. While changes will be generated, colours will start to appear in this black-and-white world.One first interesting point is obviously the use of colours, which will appear little by little as the residents of Pleasantville will start to have some real feelings and emotions generated by the presence of the two intruders, what will make them an essential part of the plot. Moreover the way they will be brought out throughout the story is really interesting as well : from a red rose representing love to the burning bush, they are all symbols and metaphors. Although the humour seems to be a little bit lightweight at the beginning, a lot of deeper subjects will be progressively developed. Indeed, Pleasantville is not only a comedy, it's also a drama that covers different topics and abstract ideas, such as tolerance, liberty,justice v.s. totalitarianism,.. A lot of important concepts to think about.. One last thing that I like is that it is a film that can be considered as « humanist ». In other words, a lot of human values are highlighted in it, like tolerance, kindness, compassion, generosity, education,..Art is also celebrated thanks to the contrast between a completely grey world and the progressive apparition of colours in it, which makes you aware of the importance of colours.To sum up, I think Pleasantville is a wonderful experience to watch for its nice atmosphere, its way of representing humanity, and, above all, for the pleasure of the eyes, generated by the amazing play with colours.",Pleasantville
548,bouncing_ball_of_rubber,More of a Critique of the 1950's Than Anything Else,10,13 April 2007,"When most people see this movie, they think of a coming-of-age for both David and Jennifer; David from a geeky, couch potato addicted to a television show from 40 years prior, while Jennifer is a wannabe ""bad girl,"" both struggling with living with their mother as she goes through a mid-life crisis. What most people don't see, and the country can thank a lack of effective history lessons in schools, is that the entire world in that television show was the United States in the 1950's.Being born in 1983, my first impressions of the 1950's was what I saw on Nick at Nite. The Patty Duke Show, Leave it to Beaver, Father Knows Best and Doobie Gillis made anyone who's parents grew up in that decade think that the 1950's was all white people living in the suburbs, when the children only feared the bully who played football, the teenagers would only be concerned about the football game or just saying hi to the cheerleader, and the mom did nothing but play bridge with the other housewives on the street until 4pm, when she would start making dinner that would be ready just in time for her WWII vet-husband to get home from his decent-salaried job at the financial institution, just so the whole family could eat and spend the rest of the evening watching television shows like The Patty Duke Show, Leave it to Beaver, Father Knows Best or Doobie Gillis. Pleasantville, before David and Jennifer became Bud and Mary-Sue, was inhabited by people like normal Americans of that time, who did not want to know that there was a big, scary world, and only wanted that pristine life.They felt sheltered from, and were almost ignorant of, the Korean War, Joe McCarthy's Red Scare, the quiz show scandals, the beginnings of the civil rights movement, and the Cuban Revolution. To most Americans of that day, they didn't want to know any of those problems, so, they just didn't know of those problems. This is just like the people of Pleasantville, who didn't know of any problems like fire, color, rock music, art, books, and even sex. It wasn't until David's and Jennifer's ""Bud"" and ""Mary-Sue"" from the 1990's that anyone knew of any of those problems existed. The actions and reactions inside Pleasantville mirrored the actions and reactions of the 1950's America.What's tragic about the movie is that the end result wasn't a full mirror. In the movie, all ended well, things were fine. In real life, the world went from care-free to the 1960's, where things weren't fine. But the product of the movie can be related by anyone who grew up in the 1950's and the 1990's.",Pleasantville
549,jwpirie,A marvel,10,5 December 2005,"Very possibly my favorite film of all time. Pleasantville explores a greatly simplified fantasy world -- a hypothetical 50's TV sitcom -- and examines what happens when reality intrudes on its premises. As Shakespeare put it, ""There's more to heaven and earth than is dreamt of in your philosophy.""Unfortunately, some reviewers see the film as commentary of another kind. They view it as a confirmation of, or attack on, their own personal philosophies, political, social, or the like. For those who are expecting such, let me say what ""Pleasantville"" is NOT:* It is not a criticism of the 1950s, its social mores or political bent.* It is not a celebration of liberalism versus some conservative straightjacket view of the world.* It is not a groundbreaking, original thought piece on philosophy, religion or anything of the like.The creators of this film could have made it such, but I think they were smarter than that.What Pleasantville IS is a celebration of real life, in all its messy, confusing, beautiful and often painful detail. And the celebration is masterfully executed.The device of the 50s sitcom is used to convey the film's central point: that it is often easy, comforting, even helpful for us to think about things in simplistic terms, and even that there isn't anything wrong with that per se.But to think about REAL LIFE this way is to live a smaller, lesser life. Life without color is easy to look at, and it certainly works. But a black-and-white life is certainly less of a life. OK, that one's easy, and that's where ""Pleasantville"" starts. (""I'm supposed to be IN COLOR!"") Even the next evolution, that life is better with sex, is pretty much taken for granted, but of course that ""enhancement"" to Pleasantville later brings the real-life complications we can all predict.And the complications continue, as Pleasantville residents discover that there are other places in the world, other people, other ways to think and imagine as evidenced in the books that had all heretofore been blank. As evidenced in the changes in music we hear at the soda shop. And these complications aren't all good. They introduce upheaval, prejudice, violence.But the film successfully carries the theme that you just can't have the good without the bad. It keeps reminding the viewer that, if you're thinking that way, you are missing a subtlety of life, and you'd better think again. And I think it goes even further, making the case that even the existence of these evils makes life the richer for living, because they enable us to distinguish what we like and wish for from what we find reprehensible.My favorite scene of the film may be when Bud brings Mr. Johnson an art book from the library. As he leafs through its pages, we are left to wonder what life would be like had we never had the chance to see these magnificent works, what a tragedy it would be, what a smaller, meaner life we would have lived. And a later remark in the film reminds us that seeing is only part of life, that the real joy is in understanding what we have the privilege to experience.The film seems at times like it is hitting the viewer over the head, but it's deeper than that. When Bud takes (Betty Sue?) to Lover's Lane, his first trip there, she offers him some berries as they sit on the grass by the pond. And then she gets up, runs to a nearby tree, picks a shiny red apple, and offers it to him. The metaphor is painfully obvious, but it's supposed to be. We all recognize it. The point is, Bud recognizes it too, and he realizes in that moment that the fact that not all change is good will sooner or later intrude on the lives of these people, which is precisely what then begins to happen in the film. The scene isn't precious for a ""Do You Get It?"" Adam & Eve metaphor, it's precious for the look on Bud's face as HE realizes the metaphor being enacted when a beautiful girl offers him a bite of a nice red apple, as his look reveals his thought: ""Uh oh. This is about to get ugly.""If you're looking for a groundbreaking thought work, look elsewhere than Pleasantville. It treats a classic theme, not a brand new one. But it does not, in my view, pretend to do more than that, and it treats that theme brilliantly.",Pleasantville
550,discogirl-1,unforgettable film of all time,8,3 January 2006,"David Wagner (Tobey Maguire) is a 90's school-kid with an addiction to a 50's black and white TV show, ""Pleasantville"". However, his hip twin sister Jennifer (Reece Witherspoon) prefers more up-to-date TV. This causes arguments and life takes a bizarre twist as the twins are zapped into Pleasantville. The peace and tranquillity soon disappears as Jennifer introduces the residents to her 90's attitude and colour starts appearing.This film is ultimately the best film to be released so far. If you are into modern day issues or concepts, then this film is a must see! Personally, I give this film a 10 for top quality special effects and the issues that appear in it such as discrimination, adultery, and racism. The way the people and the objects in this film are gradually colourised is a delight to watch, and overall, the ideas within the film are some of the most creative ones to emerge from films in recent years. It is really worth sparing two hours of your time to watch Pleasantville. I wholeheartedly recommend this movie, with the exception that it's not for young children, in spite of its PG-13 rating. This film is worth every penny that was spent in making it. Pleasantville really brings to life the controversy between people in society these days.",Pleasantville

Toby is, again, excellent at playing the wide-eyed yet knowledgeable-beyond-his years lead; the rest of the cast members are superb; cinematography beautifully simple (and simply beautiful); added to that the connections that we can all find to adolescence and its 'wonders' I think this is a thoroughly fine movie.Metaphor upon metaphor, this movie is a veritable Hero sandwich of metaphors!

552,nepfesh,Art Imitates Life - The Loss of Innocense,9,10 October 2018,"To me this film is about the changes (that actually happened) in society and within individuals. It portrays the transition, for good or bad, from the 50s with it's straight-jacketed roles, rigidity and conformity to the freedoms and expression of the 60s. It reflects the reactions to the changes of the sixties. It touches upon civil rights, racism, women's issues, group think, sexual liberation, the oppression of societal & political power, mob violence and especially the ignorant hoodlum mentality and sexual aggression of the 50s which in this case is directed toward the mother in the film. In the film, as people begin to feel, to express themselves, especially their inner-most selves, and thereby become more real, they go from their drab, black & white existence to becoming vividly colored. Indeed the entire community and surroundings become real and appropriately colored. It is an awakening; a self transformation; a transition from innocence and ignorance to awareness and knowledge. Sort of like what some baby boomers went through as they became college age. It was also a transition from one's limited and safe environment of childhood to an expanded one, that opens the whole world, but comes with the uncertainty and danger of adulthood.",Pleasantville
