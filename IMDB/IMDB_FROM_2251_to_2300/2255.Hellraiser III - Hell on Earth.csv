0,TheLittleSongbird,In the depths of hell,5,26 October 2018,"Despite appreciating horror very much (with a lot of classic ones out there, such as 'Halloween', 'Nightmare on Elm Street', 'The Texas Chainsaw Massacre', 'Night of the Living Dead' and 'The Exorcist', plus the best of Hammer House of Horror), even if not my favourite genre, it took me a while to get round to watching the 'Hellraiser' franchise. Due to having so much to watch and review, and the list keeps getting longer and longer.The film that started the franchise off is not only for me by far the best of the 'Hellraiser' films it also for me, and quite a few others it seems, is one of the stronger horror films of the 80s, though not quite of all time. What is meant by being by far the best of the 'Hellraiser' films is that it is the only one to be above very good, the nine sequels were very variable (leaning towards the disappointing) and the latter films particularly are suggestive of the franchise having run its course.From personal opinion, while a bit of a disappointment 'Hellraiser III: Hell on Earth' is still watchable and one of the better sequels in the series. Would say actually it is second best after 'Hellbound: Hellraiser II'.Quite a fair few good things here in 'Hellraiser III: Hell on Earth'. The production were fine, do prefer the nightmarishly Gothic look of the first two films but the film looks very stylish and atmosphere with visual effects that aren't overused or abused and actually a little more polished than 'Hellbound: Hellraiser II'. The theme song is quite memorable, while there are some imaginative and disturbing kills and Pinhead's scene in the church is one of the best in the series, hair-raising and wickedly funny.Did like the effort to give development to Pinhead and his story is interesting, regardless of whether it fitted within the rest of the film or not. Doug Bradley is genuinely intimidating and Terry Farrell does a decent job.It is hard however to ignore the drawbacks. 'Hellraiser III: Hell on Earth' lacks the creepiness and ambition of the previous two films, there is a lot of silliness and camp humour and it does undermine any creepiness or suspense and it just feels completely different tonally compared to its predecessors. The dialogue is toe-curling this time and didn't really see any need for some of the gore, which didn't unnerve that much and came over as cheap and gratuitous instead.Also thought the story, while slightly more coherent than parts of 'Hellbound: Hellraiser II', made little sense and was muddled. The rest of the acting is laughable and the Cebonites are nowhere near as creepy or mysterious. Worst of all is the ridiculously over-the-top and far-fetched ending, that was even more of an incomprehensible parody as the one in the previous film.Overall, watched and one of the better 'Hellraiser' sequels but could have been better. 5/10 Bethany Cox",Hellraiser III - Hell on Earth
1,Leofwine_draca,"Slick, gruesome sequel",6,21 July 2016,"I always get a kick out of watching HELLRAISER III: HELL ON EARTH, which remains an oddly enjoyable movie even though it isn't a patch on the first two in the series. Those were dark, gritty, and thoroughly terrifying horror films, whereas HELLRAISER III is a slick and superficial gore-fest typical of early 1990s Hollywood horror film-making. It's very similar in look and feel to WARLOCK: THE Armageddon and WAXWORK II: LOST IN TIME, other sequels that director Anthony Hickox made during the era. It's lost the disturbing independent vibe but replaced it with superficiality and style.The story this time around sees Pinhead trapped inside a weird statue which ends up being purchased by a sleazy womaniser who runs a nightclub. Before too long, the hellish demon is free to cause havoc once more, this time wandering Earth to claim more victims. The only person who can stop him is Terry Farrell's random protagonist, who just so happens to have possession of the powerful puzzle box.HELLRAISER III most noticeably features plenty of black humour which was missing in the gruelling first two films. My favourite part of the film is the way in which the human characters are turned into Cenobites, each with their own look and special power. The guy who shoots CDs is hilarious as is the cameraman with a literal camera in his head. There's plenty of sloppy gore on offer here and the special effects are pretty good, although Pinhead's ""look"" is a bit off and he lacks the menace he had in the first two movies. Doug Bradley just doesn't cut it as he did previously.The rest of the cast are little better, with Farrell out of her depth and the others giving occasionally laughable performances, although Paula Marshall is surprisingly effective in her smaller part. Kudos to the special effects team who create all manner of nasty mayhem involving hooks, chains, and other body-flaying scenes of carnage, with the nightclub massacre a particular highlight.",Hellraiser III - Hell on Earth
2,SnoopyStyle,going mainstream,6,27 October 2018,"In New York City, Pinhead, the puzzle box, and the other Cenobites are trapped in a pillar. J. P. Monroe buys it for his nightclub, The Boiler Room. Frustrated TV reporter Joey Summerskill (Terry Farrell) encounters Terri (Paula Marshall) at the hospital who brought in a victim of the club. She decides to investigate when her story is turned down. Terri turns out to be one of Monroe's many girlfriends and she has the box.This is the franchise turning into a more standard horror. It has the skin-ripping fun. The characters work. I love Farrell from Star Trek and she's fine as the protagonist. I like the mind games from Pinhead. The WWI dream stuff can be better substituted with an additional character. It's trying to explain the monster when it doesn't need explaining. It does give a final solution which is very important. Honestly, Pinhead is a brilliant monster design. The new ones are pretty cheesy. The camera and the CD Cenobites can exists no other time. They even try some quippy dialogue although Pinhead is undefeated as a character.",Hellraiser III - Hell on Earth
3,nogodnomasters,Where did the chain come from?,6,22 March 2020,"We are introduced to Joanne (Terry Farrell) a reporter looking for a break. Formula dictates she is the final girl. She witnesses a Hellraiser event and wants the story which connects her with a night club called the ""Boiler Room"" with a satanic decor. Terri (Paula Marshall) is an occasional girlfriend of the owner JP Monroe (Kevin Bernhardt). He owns a large pinhead statue. Terri has the puzzle box, the gateway to hell. We get the back story of Pinhead.Continuation of the series and sets up for the next level. It was okay, like ""Friday 13th 3"" or Nightmare on Elm Street 3"" and better than ""Halloween 3.""Guide: F-word. sex. near-nudity.",Hellraiser III - Hell on Earth
4,gavin6942,Departure From the Novel Leads To This...,6,11 January 2007,"A reporter (Terry Farrell) is looking for the big story and finds it at The Boiler Room, a popular club where a young woman witnessed someone die in a very painful manner. Also, the reporter has dreams of her father, who died in Vietnam. And the origin of Pinhead! Some people consider this one the best in the series. I am not one of those people. While there are many great aspects of this movie, the primitive special effects seem to subtract from the overall story. And continuing in the Hellraiser tradition, many things simply do not make sense. Who opened the art store? Where did the statue come from? Why does the statue not attack JP at first, but will later on?As I say, the special effects are primitive. And I do not mind that, because at least they put in a solid offering. But some things just seem like they could have been done better. In Hellraiser parts 1 and 2, there was no problem creating a person without skin that looked creepy. We see another example in this film, but they also get ""slurped"" into a statue and this is very unconvincing. In 1992! The effects of the original ""Nightmare on Elm Street"" blow this out of the water. Others have complained about the cenobites looking like Borg rejects, and that is a fair point -- this film goes above and beyond in incorporating terrible ideas into cenobite bodies.Terry Farrell does a fine job as the lead. She is a strong heroine, and unlike your typical horror woman, she has more brains than body. You might recognize Farrell as a character from the greatest sitcom on television in recent years, ""Becker"". The plot is respectable. There really was no more story to tell about the Cotton family at this point. Moving on to show what lengths evil will go to in order to return to Earth was a good change. And brought to us by Peter Atkins (also the writer of part 4) and Anthony Hickox (who directed the incredible ""Waxwork"" films).I do not care for the change in direction the films take from here, though, regarding the cenobites. I understand after explaining Pinhead's origin (something I am very thankful for) they opened the door for more cenobites, but this film and the fourth introduce some of the lamest characters with the lamest one-liners. The subplot of the father is okay, but also makes the Hellraiser mythology even more complex than it is... now we have Hell, Earth, the mind, who can and cannot touch the Lament Configuration... oy vey.Obviously when a horror series gets going, the sequels are not going to be what the original was. You get paler and paler copies of the original (like ""Multiplicity""). But ""Hellraiser"", unlike ""Leprechaun"", at least kept the quality respectable through part four... and some (though not myself) would say even up to part six. Check this one out to clear up some mysteries, then catch part four to get the whole story.",Hellraiser III - Hell on Earth
5,jboothmillard,Hellraiser III: Hell on Earth,4,21 April 2013,"The first film is a great dark story, the second film was a blood fest with a rather silly story, I will admit that I didn't have very high expectations that this third film would be an improvement, but I watched it anyway. Basically it continues where Hellbound: Hellraiser II left off, where the block came out of the blood covered mattress, and Cenobite leader Pinhead (Doug Bradley) is trapped along with the puzzle box inside of this carved pillar, alongside other faces, it is the Pillar of Souls. Rich and spoilt playboy J.P. Monroe (Kevin Bernhardt) is the one who buys this pillar, being a collector of dark objects and artwork, he is the owner of the night club The Boiler Room. Young television reporter Joanne 'Joey' Summerskill (Terry Farrell) is looking for a big story to be taken seriously, and she starts an investigation into the strange puzzle box, which was stolen from the club by Terri (Paula Marshall), and Joey witnesses the pain the box can create when it mutilates someone is hospital. While Joey uncovers some video tape interviews by former victim of the Cenobites, Kirsty Cotton (Ashley Laurence), Pinhead lays dormant in the pillar until some blood is dropped onto it, and he awakens to consume club goer Sandy (Aimée Leigh). With the help of Monroe he gains the blood from a couple of other victims to completely reform out of the pillar, and meanwhile the spirit of Captain Elliott Spencer, the man who became Pinhead, visits the wannabe reporter to warn her about the demon. Pinhead has become his own entity and will not gain any humanity back, and he will bring Hell on Earth and take over at his own accord unless he is stopped, and he turns many innocent victims into Cenobites with powers. Joey does use a little help from the puzzle box to try and stop the terror, but her main goal is to fuse Captainn Spencer and the Cenobite leader back together to become one entity and be sent back to Hell. In the end, after the epic battle against the new monsters and the dark powers from the realm of evil Pin head and his former self are fused and his entity and the others sent back into the puzzle box, Joey sticks it in the wet cement to make sure no-one else will find it, but the new building it is for is built to lo0ok just like the markings of the box, i.e. Lament Configuration, this twist continues in the next film. Also starring Ken Carpenter as Daniel 'Doc' Fisher and Peter G. Boynton as Joey's Father. This is obviously the film that signalled that Pinhead was the only remaining villain from the first film, so no more Chatterer or The Female (or Butterball), but I guess that is the point of the sequels, because Pinhead is the horror icon, and he is obviously the most watchable part of the series, with his philosophical dialogue and love for torture. The story is still a little bit messy like the previous, the deaths and blood spills are certainly still inventive and in some cases funny, and the use of church stuff and going against good in the world is interesting, a better but still slightly disappointing horror. Okay!",Hellraiser III - Hell on Earth
6,Tweekums,Hell comes to New York,7,24 December 2018,"After the events of the previous film the Cenobyte Pinhead is trapped in a stone pillar along with the cube. This is purchased by arrogant New York playboy J. P. Monroe to decorate his night club; The Boiler Room. The film has a new protagonist; reporter Joey Summerskill. She is brought into the story when she sees a man taken to hospital with chains hooked into his body. The only witness tells Joey that the chains came from the mysterious puzzle box that was in the club. Joey investigates the club and soon finds herself caught up in a nightmare that will see numerous people killed as hell is unleashed onto the streets of New York; only Joey will be able to stop it if she can send Pinhead back to hell.It must be said that this film isn't as good as the first two but it still isn't bad. The main weakness is that the rules have been changed so that anybody can be a victim of the Cenobytes rather than those who willingly summon them; this is at least explained but mainly it feels like an excuse to raise the body count. As one might expect there are plenty of fairly gruesome deaths; unfortunately some are accompanied by a 'witty' one-liner. Pinhead has a far larger role in this film and we do learn more about his origins; Doug Bradley does a fine job in the dual roles of Pinhead and the ghost Captain Elliott Spencer, the First World War officer who later became Pinhead. Terry Farrell is also impressive as Joey. Unfortunately many of the other cast members are distinctly wooden. Overall I'd say that even if it isn't as good as the first two films it is still worth watching.",Hellraiser III - Hell on Earth
7,BA_Harrison,More cenobite silliness.,6,2 December 2006,"The third entry in the Hellraiser series shows a distinct change in approach, aiming itself squarely at the teen market rather than at the 'serious horror fan'. Pinhead returns once again, dishing out pain and misery to all who cross his path. It is up to intrepid reporter Joey Summerskill (Terry Farrell) to try and send the spiky-bonced monster (and his legion of all-new 'cool' cenobites) back to Hell.Anthony Hickox, director of straight-to-video horrors such as Waxworks and Sundown:Vampires in Retreat, eschews the rather serious and dark tone of Clive Barker's original movie, opting instead to go with a rather more accessible plot that itself takes a back seat to the special effects. This film is all about the visuals and Hickox loads the film with some very effective (and some not-so-quite effective) makeup and optical FX. And in true early-90s fashion, the action is accompanied by a pretty awful 'metal' soundtrack.Fans of the first two films may not like the new direction the film takes, but those who found Barker's vision rather too twisted in the first place won't be overly offended. I enjoyed the movie for what it wasa big dollop of B-movie excessand in that respect, I think Hickox has done a pretty good job. It won't win any awards, but you'll have fun while it lasts.",Hellraiser III - Hell on Earth
8,paul_haakonsen,Hell sure wasn't impressive...,5,21 December 2015,"With the title ""Hellraiser III: Hell on Earth"" this third installment of the ""Hellraiser"" franchise does seem to want to accomplish something extraordinarily grand. But truth be told then there wasn't even remotely anything even close to Hell being unleashed unto our world.That being said then don't get me wrong, because ""Hellraiser III: Hell on Earth"" is still an adequate movie in the ""Hellraiser"" franchise. But it just wasn't as thrilling or vile as the original ""Hellraiser"" movie.One of the good things about this third movie is that more depth is added to the Pinhead character and it was a nice touch to offer that to the fans of the franchise.The fans watch ""Hellraiser"" for the deviant ideas and creations of Clive Barker's warped mind, but sadly this third movie didn't have a lot of a screen time with the Cenobites, which was a real shame. And the new Cenobites that were introduced in the movie just weren't all that impressive or memorable. I was, however, quite impressed with the stone pillar in which Pinhead was imprisoned. It had amazing details and a certain H.R. Geiger quality to it.""Hellraiser III: Hell on Earth"" is an entertaining enough movie in its own right, but it just wasn't the best in the ""Hellraiser"" franchise.",Hellraiser III - Hell on Earth
9,Coventry,"The ""waste"" of a perfectly good franchise",6,15 October 2003,"first of all, Hellraiser III isn't a BAD film. In fact, it's quite good if it would stand on its own. And it certainly is one of the more decent efforts in the overall disappointing decade of the 90's. Compared to the first two Hellraisers, however, it's a bit of a failure. Hellraiser ('87) and Hellbound ('88) were horrorfilms in the purest possible form and my two all-time favorites. There were 4 indicators in those movies that brought them close to being the definition of horror.1. Creating a unique and utterly morbid atmosphere (through settings, music etc...)2. Building up an unbearable tension ( the occasional twists etc..)3. Showing nasty and very bloody sequences in a beautiful way4. The presence of a true horror icon !! ( in this case...PINHEAD )Hellraiser III fails to at least 3 of these points...The dark and macabre settings from Hell and the mental institution are replaced by a bar which plays horrible rock music, there's almost no tension to detect and it's a very predictable story. The gore however is still present, but the quality of it doesn't come near the originals. The Boiler Room massacre puts Clive Barker to shame, I think. The whole story know turns around the character of Pinhead. He's more than ever the star of this movie and that almost goes wrong. He talks too much and he even starts to become funny. That certainly isn't good for a horror icon. ( Look at what a joke Fred Krueger became ). Director Anthony Hickox obviously is a big fan of Pinhead and he wanted the movie to be especially about him. Every now and then Hickox tries to link this film to the original story but it clearly isn't his biggest concern. The tapes about Kirsty in the Chanard institute and the dream-sequences where Joey meets Elliot Spencer are too fake and forced. The movie does explain where Pinhead comes from but it certainly isn't stressed enough...Hellraiser III goes very much over the top near the end and I almost lost my love towards Pinhead after the church scene ! I'm trying to forget that particular part. It really is a shame that this movie is part of the series. If this would have been a new film ( with a new demon ) it would have been an enjoyable, well-made change. But as part of a great series it fails to deliver and you're left behind with a disappointment. This movie was followed by episode 4: Bloodline and a few others after that. The fourth is a surprisingly good attempt to bring back the spirit of the original ones and should be watched directly after the first two. Everything that came after part 4 should be skipped unless you're a die-hard Pinhead fan.",Hellraiser III - Hell on Earth
10,Theo Robertson,Not Sure About This One,5,15 December 2002,"HELL ON EARTH is an improvement on HELLBOUND. Or is it ? Well in its favour HELL ON EARTH eases up on the stomach churning gore that made its predecessor such a turn off , but I can`t help thinking that Clive Barker has sold out the franchise . Sure much of this film is entertaining but it`s also - despite having a couple of Brits as Director and screenwriter - very Americanised and dumbed down . Out goes the unique visions of hell and in its place we get massacres and bullet proof monsters stalking the streets of New York . I did enjoy some of this film but it is uneven in terms of both script , direction and acting . It takes a long time for the action to start for instance and seems to contradict much of what went before in the two previous movies and I was totally unconvinced by the battle scenes . South east Asia seems to be composed of fields and elm trees just like in THE GREEN BERETS and the trenches of the great war weren`t muddy enough for my liking .But as in THE MONSTER CLUB the demons in this aren`t as hellish as humans are. In HELL ON EARTH we see the ripped apart bodies of young men from the first world war and Vietnam while we see panoramas of the WTC twin towers . Compared to what human beings are capable of the cenobites are surely angels after all",Hellraiser III - Hell on Earth
11,poolandrews,"""Down the dark decades of your pain this will seem like heaven."" Disappointing third instalment.",6,7 January 2006,"Hellraiser III: Hell on Earth starts in a New York art galley where night club owning playboy J.P. Monroe (Kevin Bernhardt) buys an interesting & unique piece of art, a sculpture that contains the remains of Pinhead (Doug Bradley) the sadistic Cenobite from the original Hellriaser (1987) & Hellbound: Hellraiser II (1988). Joey Summerskill (Terry Farrell) is a journalist on assignment reporting for a news program from an emergency ward in a Hospital where she is witness to a strange incident. A guy is rushed in with hooks attached to chains piercing his flesh, Joey looks on as the guy's head explodes. The guy was brought in with a girl named Terri (Paula Marshall) whom Joey locates & questions about the incident. Terri says that the guy stole a strange puzzle box from Monroe's sculpture & that's where the hooks came from, the sculpture is in Monroe's night club The Boiler Room. Joey is determined to find out the secret of the puzzle box & land herself a big story. Meanwhile Pinhead has convinced Monroe to bring him victims so that he may resurrect himself & raise hell on earth...Directed by Anthony Hickox this is the point where it's generally agreed the Hellraiser series became crap, while Hellraiser III: Hell on Earth isn't really that bad it's nowhere near as good as it's illustrious predecessors. The script by Peter Atkins, who also makes an appearance as one of the new Cenobites, turns the series into the crappy horror franchise that it has become & tries as hard as it can to appeal to the American teenage market, ugh. For a start it makes a central character out of Pinhead, the previous films were never just about him, they were about an overall feel, creepiness & atmosphere & not revolving around a invulnerable horror character spouting lots of one-liners. The other Cenobites also disappoint, instead of the twisted grotesque design from the previous films Hellraiser III: Hell on Earth turns them into a gimmick, from a bartender (writer Peter Atkins in a cameo) who uses his fire breath to ignite alcohol, a DJ (Brent Bolthouse) who has CD's implanted in his face & he uses them to throw at people (they must have razor edges or something) & Doc (Ken Carpenter) as the cameraman who has a camera stuck through his head, right. They come across as tacky & crowd pleasing. In the previous films the Cenobites were kept in the background, all mysterious & menacing while this time around they dominate & have little purpose. The films starts off a bit slow but things pick up at the end & it's not a bad watch but just comes a such a disappointment after the two originals which were two of the best horrors to come along in decades.Director Hickox has to take responsibility for ruining the series. The films set in New York, again to appeal to American audiences, he gives Pinhead's alter ego Elliot Spencer a large role & it all becomes supernatural & muddled. In the end Pinhead fights himself & it's just mundane. The other Cenobites are wasted, they use their 'special power' to kill someone & that's it. The puzzle box is almost completely forgotten & is no longer needed to summon the Cenobites. The dark atmosphere & tension present in the previous films is severely lacking & replaces them with explosions & silly novelty deaths. There are a few decent gore scenes, hooks embedded in flesh, exploding heads, severed limbs, skinless people, a hole on someones head, a melted hand & death by lethal CD's!Hellraiser III: Hell on Earth had studio backing which is why it ended up so commercialised so it probably had a decent budget. The film looks nice throughout & has good production values. The acting didn't impress me.This is a disappointing film yet at the same time not a particularly bad one in it's own right. If you liked the first two for their originality, darkness & gore then I'm pretty sure that you will be very disappointed with Hellraiser III: Hell on Earth like I was. Having said that I still think it's OK & worth a watch.",Hellraiser III - Hell on Earth
12,grantss,"Quite disappointing, especially after the first movie",4,9 August 2017,"Quite disappointing, especially after the first movie.Hellraiser II picks up where the first movie left off. Kirsty (played bu Ashley Laurence) is in an institution after her experiences of the first movie. She is then visited by the gang of ghouls we previously met...The first movie was quite original for a horror movie. (Not that this says much, as most horror movies are incredibly formulaic and predictable). The plot was fairly solid too, with good direction and special effects.This, the second movie, is not anywhere near as good. Plot feels random, unoriginal and unengaging. The story just lurches from one contrived, inexplicable horror scene to another.Not worth watching - save your time.",Hellraiser III - Hell on Earth
13,Boba_Fett1138,They really messed up things for this one.,5,11 January 2010,"It's very simple why this movie does not work out as well, or is as great as, the first two movies. You can really blame the movie its script for that.The movie has a quite messy story, that besides strays too much away from the first two movies. It's a movie that is different in its style and with its treatment of its characters. Pinhead for instance gets his hands way too dirty in this movie and does way too much. What was the case with the first two movies was that the evil was called upon by the human characters, who also did some horrible things themselves. In this movie it seems as if Pinhead wants more and more power, after he has been released again. This was not at all what the character at first was about. A lot of things just don't make sense within this movie, especially when you start comparing it with what happened in the first two movies.This movie too desperately tries to be an horror movie, done in somewhat the same style as the A Nightmare on Elm Street movies. Even dreams play a quite prominent role in this movie its story.What was more painful than Pinhead's pleasures of pain was the movie its acting. There are some real horrible actors in this movie and since they gave Doug Bradley way more lines and screen time this time it becomes all the more obvious that he just simply isn't a very talented actor.The movie just doesn't ever become a very compelling one to watch. If you have seen the first two movies this one is still somewhat watchable, though you will foremost be still disappointed.5/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",Hellraiser III - Hell on Earth
14,view_and_review,Bloodier and Dumber,3,9 April 2020,"Look, we've already seen what Pinhead can do with his hooks and chains, but how is he back into action?It makes no sense to go into the details of how Pinhead came back after being destroyed in part two. Through some improbable and convoluted way involving a copper statue, the box, and a pompous night club owner, Pinhead was brought back to life in New York. Now he's in the real world and he is seeking to stay.A struggling reporter named Joanne ""Joey"" Summerskill (Terry Farrell) has the box and the ability to send Pinhead back to hell. The way to send him back to hell is very vague and uninformative, but at least Joey understands... I think.This entire episode was a mess. No one is going to accuse horror movies of being intelligent, but some are dumber than others. Pinhead still desires pleasures and flesh, but the victims this time around are just set pieces, they have no personalities and no true characteristics besides vapidity. ""Hell on Earth"" went for maximum carnage as though that was an adequate replacement for substance. So many horror movie franchises do that once they get into their third, fourth, and fifth episodes. Their idea wells run dry so they just reach for the body count button as though that will mask the pitiful plot when all it does is make the movie bloodier and dumber.",Hellraiser III - Hell on Earth
15,kannibalcorpsegrinder,One of the best in the series,10,31 October 2014,"Sensing a chance for a real story, a newswoman stumbles upon a sociopath art dealer who's in possession of the box that summons Pinhead and his demons and forces her to find its origins to finally defeat him.Frankly, this one is one of the most underrated efforts in the series. Among the many positives here is the fact this one finally manages to uncover the real past involving Pinhead and his connection to the box which causes this to really connect the series together. By doing that in accordance with the heavy use of action within this, as there's no shortage of exciting, high-energy action scenes, this one is packed to the brim with exciting elements. The opening hospital scene that sets up the cause to investigate the nightclub, the first encounter in the bedroom with the Pinhead statue, the gradual realization of the friends turned into the new Cenobites and the massacre at the nightclub are just some of the rather impressive and exciting action through this, and each one tends to get all the more exciting by gaining in spectacle that causes all the rather enjoyable fun throughout. Of course, the real spectacle here is the mad dash through the streets where there's non-stop threats on display, from the initial attacks like the possessed power-lines and charged water chasing after her to the blasting eruptions underground and finally the appearance of the Cenobites which lead s to all sorts of chaos as their new-found powers are put on display against the few passersby left on the street as well as trying to contain her running down the street. This is a lot of fun and really gets the kind of exceptionally enjoyable and gory action-packed sequence that scores quite well as a show highlight as well. There's also the rather fun feature of having Pinhead around for quite a bit of screen-time being ably rewarded with him fully getting those glorious monologues and dementedly enjoyable quips that he goes through on the others, and the ones in here are among the better ones in the series due to all the extra time he has. That also gives him some fine extra scenes as the tormenting of the priest in the church and the release from the statue which really completes this one quite well. The only thing that really hurts this one is the battle in the secondary dimension that really just amounts to all sorts of posturing without really doing anything and is filled with some lame special effects throughout despite being quite impressive the rest of the film. It's the only real flaw in this one.Rated R: Graphic Violence, Graphic Language, Brief Nudity, a sex scene and mild drug use.",Hellraiser III - Hell on Earth
16,FlashCallahan,Panic at the disco....,6,18 September 2014,"Reporter Joey Summerskill learns about the notorious puzzle box, the unbearable pain it can bring, and Pinhead, after seeing a young clubber get ripped apart by the box's chains. She tracks the box and a woman named Terri down to a club called the Boiler Room, owned by playboy J.P., who feeds Pinhead, trapped in a marble pillar, blood from club members so he can escape. As time runs out, Joey must think of a way to bring Pinhead and his Cenobites back to the realm of Pinhead's human self or succumb to an eternity of pain and suffering......Seeing the third installment as a fifteen year old teenager was, ironically, heaven. The make up was brilliant, it was all blood and gore, and the music was loud.Seeing it twenty years later, the make up is still great, the blood and gore covers up the obviously bonkers plot, and it's blooming loud. Sometimes so loud you cannot hear the bad script, but you can still see the poor CGI.The Hellraiser franchise has always been an oddity. Obviously Barker never intended Pin- head to be referenced as much as Freddy or Jason, he wasn't even a main character in the series until this movie, and this is where the series went down the wrong alley.The director is notorious for making goofy films. Look at the Waxwork movies, and the second Warlock, enjoyable but throwaway fluff.The Hellraiser films where supposed to be serious Gothic horrors, and thanks to this, we get a video camera faced man walking round shouting stuff like close up.It's not bad by any means, but imagine how many must have felt when the franchise basically sold out?",Hellraiser III - Hell on Earth
17,Aaron1375,Hey Pinhead is finally the star.,6,6 February 2004,"After the first two movies being the most popular character and having very little screen time, finally Pinhead is the focus.  Ironically, this one is rated lower than the first two, so maybe he was better off in the background.  I actually like this one about the same as two and I liked two better than one.  So I did like this part better than one also.  I am guessing though, this one isn't liked as much because it really is more of your standard slasher rather than the twisted world of the first two so I can understand why people didn't like it as much.  This one has Pinhead actually separated from the human he was.  He is still part of this macabre statue seen at the end of part two and he is now owned by a very odd art dealer.  This and that happens and before long Pinhead is unleashed on earth killing everyone in his sights and changing them into more weird beings like him.  There is also this lady involved I think she was a reporter and she has a dream of the guy who Pinhead was.  All in all I thought it was okay, but this is the last Hellraiser movie I watched and from what I see here there are quite a few more of them.",Hellraiser III - Hell on Earth
18,trashgang,better then part 2 due the church scene,8,22 September 2016,"First of all, be sure to see the full uncut version of 96 minutes, mostly you will find the cut version of 91 minutes or TV version clocking in at 89 minutes!3 year after part 2 the franchise was back. Nothing to do with previous parts from now on every entry stood on it's own. Of course Kirsty (Ashley Lawrence) was back for a moment to lay a link to other parts but that's all. Away from the UK up to New York. An owner of a Goth club the Boiler Room bought a statue that delivers pain. A journalist witnesses the arrival of a victim at a hospital full of chains and his head explode. Off she goes with a Goth chick to see what is going on. Soon they discover the Channard archive.It takes a while before pinhead comes in. The thing they did was putting pinhead in lighting so the mystery and atmosphere of part 1 is gone, the same happened with Freddy Kruger remember. But they were clever enough to actually tell the story of Captain Elliot Spencer (Bradley) who becomes pinhead as we know. So we have the story taking place in NY and the story taking place at WW 1. To see the horrors of pinhead you have to wait an hour, but once he enters the gore do comes in. Not that bad after all this entry. If you are searching for the full uncut the thing added is more blah blah done by Captain Spencer and some gore at the trenches. Further you go deeper into conversations. It's also the first hellraiser with nudity. For me better than part 2 and pinhead at his best at the church.

20,Smells_Like_Cheese,Pinhead gets technical,6,17 March 2012,"Strange thing in the world of the horror genre, we have the big names of Jason, Freddy and Michael. But there are a few names while still well known for some reason didn't provide such a big splash when it came to the box office like Hellraiser with Pinhead who is one of the best monsters in cinema. The monster is nothing more than about torture and pain, he feels no mercy towards anyone and loves the pleasure of hurting your flesh. The first Hellraiser is without a doubt a twisted crazy classic, to get into Clive Barker's head must be a trip. He created some very disturbing images that will never get out of your head once you see Hellraiser. It was the first time where a horror film had started dark and stayed dark throughout the entire movie and there was no letting go to let you breathe. Then the sequel came along, still staying dark and having a new world to take us into with the same characters and our questions from the first film were answered. It was a good sequel that could hold up a candle to the original. Then, in the spirit of most horror films, we were given the third Hellraiser called Hell on Earth.The revelation of his own former humanity has resulted in Pinhead being split into two distinct entities: His former self, British Army Captain Eliot Spencer, and a manifestation of Spencer's id, which takes on the form of Pinhead. While Spencer ends up in limbo, Pinhead is trapped, along with the puzzle box, amongst the writhing figures and distorted faces etched into the surface of an intricately carved pillar - the Pillar of Souls. The pillar is bought by the rich and spoiled J.P. Monroe, owner of a popular nightclub called The Boiler Room. An ambitious young television reporter, Joey, slowly begins to learn about Pinhead and the mysterious puzzle box. She is introduced to the pain the box can bring when she views a teenage club-goer being ripped apart by the box's chains in a hospital emergency room. Joey is contacted by the spirit of Elliot Spencer, who tells her that this ""Pinhead"" is a separate entity. Without Spencer's humanity to act as a balancing influence, this Pinhead is completely evil and has no sense of order. Rather than abide by the laws of the Cenobite realm, he will indiscriminately wreak havoc on Earth for his own pleasure unless he can be stopped.So given new eye candy with Terry Farrell as the leading lady, competing with Ashley Laurence as Kirsty is no easy task. Terry does do pretty well in keeping up with Elliot Spencer, but her scenes with Pinhead are not up to par. A lot of fans did complain about the new cenobites, that they were too goofy looking, I agree in some sense but still liked the over all look of them. I thought they still were pretty intimidating, well except for the CD throwing cenobite, what was that about? I loved how in the end there were about 10 explosions every 2 minutes and they kept going and going and going. I also got a great kick out of how every person Joey bumped into died a second later in the end, if she ran into me on the other street, I'd be more afraid of her than Pinhead. The way people reacted in this film was unreal at times and the story was a bit silly and a let down from the two previous films. But I did find a certain entertainment from the film and I think some people are a little too harsh on it. Pinhead came to bring Hell on Earth and he certainly did for an hour and a half.6/10",Hellraiser III - Hell on Earth
21,Red-Barracuda,Another good instalment in this series,7,5 November 2021,"Well, I have to say that this series has surprisingly maintained the quality level once again, with this entry being at least as good as 'Hellbound', its actually better in several ways though really, as unlike that previous one the ambition here doesn't overstretch its reach. The story this time has Pinhead returning via a macabre sculpture purchased by a sleazy nightclub owner. Amongst the highlights, there is a bloody massacre in the club and new, inventively designed Cenobites roaming the city causing pertubation and despair. I'm sure this series must have fallen off the ledge eventually as it went on, but the first three instalments have been very good in my opinion and showcases what an original concept this franchise was.",Hellraiser III - Hell on Earth

23,KineticSeoul,"It's a watchable third installment in the ""Hellraiser"" franchise",5,30 May 2014,"The previous ""Hellraiser"" movies portrayed Pinhead as this mysterious enigma that is a force to be reckoned with. This time around Pinhead is portrayed as some boogeyman that needs other to power him back up. The plot is somewhat similar of the goons trying to get a powerful evil villain to come back to the real world with a physical form and powers. While a female reporter is trying to find out what is going on with crazy murders that is taking place and having crazy dreams and visions while doing so. The plot this time is super far-fetched and doesn't make much sense at all, especially when it comes to the human mind. The scare factor is almost all gone with this installment with more human indulgence going on. It actually seemed like a rehash of the first movie with more stuff going on, but more doesn't necessarily mean better when it comes to movies. This time it shows the a lot more human side of Pinhead and his personality traits when he was human. Of his thoughts, motives and desires. Which in a way would have been cool, but takes away from the effective momentum of Pinhead as a horror icon. Not only that this installment breaks away from the rules when it comes to the cenobites (it does explain why, but it gets distracting and feels like a cop-out for mayhem). This one expands upon the human indulgence on the human flesh and pleasure, not in depth though but exterior wise (most of the movie takes place at a night club). Including a bit more masochism as well when it comes to the humans and Pinhead. But it fails to expand up on the mythos in a effective manner. I personally don't think this installment is a effective installment, but it's just alright. It's not awful and for the most part at least watchable.5.6/10",Hellraiser III - Hell on Earth
24,thesar-2,"Ah, Hell",4,25 July 2010,"They've got to come up with better subtitles. The same word showing up in the main and subtitle should never be done once (Hellbound: Hellraiser II,) but twice? (Hellraiser III: Hell on Earth) What's next? Hellraiser: Hell in a Handbasket? All Hell Breaks Loose: Hellraiser? Or just: Ah, Hell, Another Hellraiser? (Actually, there'll be more in the future of the series: Hellseeker and Hellworld. I don't think those were as clever as mine.) While they're at it, they should pick up a better screenplay writer. Or reboot the series, despite a lot of people's distaste for reboots/remakes. Hellraiser III: Hell on Earth, though not a horrible movie, would've been best served shelved and then rebooted two decades later.In the same lines of other 1980s and early 1990s horror franchise sequels, comes Pinhead's third outing in which now the box is bestowed upon a TV reporter, Joey (Farrell,) in the Big Apple who must trick Pinhead – for some demon, sorry, Cenobite, he's pretty naïve – in the ghost world of Pinhead's alter-ego Captain Spencer so Pinhead can be defeatedONCE AND FOR ALL! Seriously, they were making this up as they went along. But there's a little more to the thin story. Joey's trying to make it big in the news, so she's trying to crack a story after witnessing a exploding victim of the puzzle box everyone in the Horror Movie world should avoid, much like saying Candyman 5x in the mirror or going into the waterwhen they tell you there's a shark or piranha in there.Meanwhile, Pinhead's pinned to a post and copying from the movie's two predecessors, he needs someone to bring him blood so he can escape. No problem – these Hellraiser movies are chalk full of fools. Needless to say, he escapes, and there really is Hell on Earth with the biggest blood bath totaling more deaths than the first two movies combined times six.I admired that about this movie. Not only was the subtitle (lazy, though) accurate, but with the very limited budget – what producer really thought his/her return on investment would be high, anyways, so aim low – they did an effective job at mimicking Superman II's NYC Street Fight. (Yes, I'm aware it was Metropolis in the Superman flick, but NYC was always the inspiration for NYC.) In addition to the street scene where Joey must flee Discman (I actually liked that one) and other foes, the club attack was pretty impressive, for what it was. If you're into Slicing'N'Dicing types of horror movies.The lines were weak (SEE: Hellbound: Hellraiser II's much better display of Pinhead quotes,) the special effects – though slightly improved (SLIGHTLY) – weren't quite there yet and the sound quality was awful, as was the acting. The sequel's definitely inferior, and they literally just made up new rules or new scenarios to fit the screenplay that had to take all but 15 minutes, which included a 10 minute break, to write, but it's recommended for ONLY die-hard Pinhead fans. You could do worse.",Hellraiser III - Hell on Earth
25,gridoon,Plodding sequel.,4,30 December 1999,"The third installment. The third effort. The third failure. Is this series cursed? That seems to be the only reasonable explanation. Like its predecessors, this film makes little sense, doesn't even follow the rules that it has previously established and adds up to a waste of time. At least they made it a little less gruesome and repellent than ""Part II"" (which any normal person must have found unwatchable), but the plodding pacing of this third part in almost equally disastrous.",Hellraiser III - Hell on Earth
26,Robert_duder,The first mainstream Hellraiser film does well enough while leaving some key things behind,8,14 July 2011,"What made Hellraiser one and two brilliant besides the direct hand that Clive Barker had in it was the special effects. They were low budget films that they went out of their way to create this incredible fantasy world with well made special effects that drew you into their world and created this twisted fantasy world. When a film doesn't have a huge backing or Hollywood money I think the film makers get to do more creatively and have to work with less and that is what can make or break an indie film especially a horror indie film. So enter Hellraiser 3 which you can absolutely tell was the film where they started to get Hollywood money. The special effects are a little less realistic and more computer generated. The story is a little more mainstream and same with the characters. Sadly we also lose the main character of Kirsty Cotton who was the Hellraiser scream queen from one and two although fortunately she is shown in a small segment to help move the story along. Hellraiser 3 isn't bad and it still keeps the continuity going which is great but I felt like it sort of trivialized Pinhead and made him the joke rather than the evil killer.Kevin Bernhardt is the sleazy club owner who is sucked into Pinhead's evil world of lust and pain. His character is vapid and emotionless and basically just there to be the evil human villain which I suppose he accomplishes. Terry Farrell is our new heroine and she does well as the strong headstrong reporter. Her connection to Pinhead's character works well and the investigation she does carries the story well. Paula Marshall is decent as the lost homeless girl being used and abused by Bernhardt's character. Marshall and Farrell have good chemistry together and I think are underused as a team. Of course Doug Bradley returns to his signature role as Pinhead and his real life counterpart Elliot Spencer. Bradley embodies Pinhead and is certainly a horror master in character. I cannot imagine anyone else playing Pinhead. The voice, his behaviour and the entire character is twisted and disturbing even though Hellraiser 3 made him seem a little less mysterious and evil and more mainstream.One of the highlights of the film and perhaps some might think as a stumble is the addition of the creative, twisted, and almost humorous 'new' cennobites created by the puzzle box. Camerahead (played by Ken Carpenter) who also plays Farrell's human camera man before being turned, CD the DJ (my favourite as he has some incredibly gory kills with flashy saw like CD's), and Barbie Cennobite (a bartender turned killer). The climatic scene of the three cennobites attacking civilians in the street is without a doubt a cool scene although as mentioned very Hollywood. But for me it did not ruin the film, it simply made it a little more mainstream. It didn't hold the true level of fear and mystery and gore that the first two films did. Director Anthony Hickox started with some truly great really bad B-Movie horror films so this was right up his alley at the time but he definitely slipped into just straight up bad B-Movies which is unfortunate because I do see some talent here. If you're a true Hellraiser fan obviously this one might offend your senses but for a third instalment and as a huge horror buff I didn't mind this one bit. It was worthy albeit different than the previous ones. The series may be stepping downwards but its a slow stepping so not so bad. 8/10",Hellraiser III - Hell on Earth
27,bowmanblue,Dramatic drop in quality,7,1 October 2017,"If you're into serious sickness in your horror and skinless corpses getting down and dirty with each other before hatching murderous plots, then Hellraiser 1 and 2 should do quite nicely for you. They follow each other and tell the tale of a mysterious puzzle box that, when opened, summons the 'cenobites' – a race of demons who want to tear you apart for their own amusement. The first two films go together nicely and the second expands on the first. However, with part three we're introduced to new characters and the series seems to deviate from what's gone before. The only thing that links it is 'Pinhead.' And, if you don't know who that is then you obviously haven't seen any cover art for the franchise. He's the 'lead cenobite' and basically the only real reason you're going to want to watch part three. In fact, Pinhead, despite being the villain, is the most charismatic and interesting aspect of the whole film. Once you take him out of it there's really little left that's any good.It's about a female reporter who discovers the existence of the cenobites and the box that calls them and decides to investigate. However, the whole film is very dated. Somehow the first two seem to exist in a time and place that's pretty indeterminate. I had difficulty telling whether the originals were set in America or the UK. Here it's set firmly in nineties America – and it always will be. Everything screams nineties, with the possible exception of the acting, which in cases like 'Doc' could well be taken from the nineteen forties. I hate to pick on one actor, but the lead female's cameraman seems to act like he's reading his lines off a prompt card out of shot.At least he's not in it that much. The lead female is about as generic as you can get and just stumbles from one forced plot device into the next. Everything about the film screams 'low budget' and, despite a few nice moments of gore and practical (bloody!) effects, everything falls on Pinhead's shoulder to save.If you're a fan of the first two, know that the drop in quality is about the only thing dramatic about 'Part III.' Most of it is dire, interspersed with good scenes starring the bad guy who you might as well root for seeing as the heroes are so damn bland. Oh, and watch out for the dumbest cops ever to be caught on camera in the final act. They deserve everything that's coming to them.",Hellraiser III - Hell on Earth
28,ericstevenson,Could have been better or worse,6,20 October 2017,"I admit that this isn't a film I enjoyed but I ended up disliking it a lot less than most people. I can't say it's a guilty pleasure because I still didn't enjoy it, but I enjoyed it a lot more than most people? This is notable in being the movie in the series where Pinhead gets the most kills. I think it technically has one of the highest kill counts in any slasher movie. Pinhead initially appears without his henchman but they do come later. In the first couple of movies, most of the kills were done by other characters oddly enough. It actually was pretty creative.The main problem is that it is hard to take some of this stuff seriously. It doesn't really get entertaining until the last third or so. It's hard to take seriously a lot of the goofy special effects but to be fair, some of them do work. I don't like how it tries to look like some artsy film when it's often an excuse to show disgusting stuff. This was gross even by the standards of the other movies. There is some good dialogue, especially when the priest says there are no demons and they are just parables and metaphors. **1/2",Hellraiser III - Hell on Earth
29,CuriosityKilledShawn,Pinhead Goes to Hollywood,6,18 November 2017,"Things get dumber and sillier in this second sequel. The series could have ended with Hellraiser II but there's profit to be had, folks. And so the series endured. The original ending for Hellraiser II had Julia rise up out of the mattress after devouring the delivery man, but as it was filmed, it was the torture pillar (which doesn't make sense, but I'll accept it). If Julia had come back then the series might have went in a more thoughtful direction, alas, it was Pinhead and the new owners, Dimension Films, wanted to milk every last penny out of him.The torture pillar (looking nothing like it did previously) is now on sale in an art gallery where it is purchased by arrogant rich kid JP Munroe. The pillar is installed in the private sex chamber of his club The Boiler Room, where early 90s kids go to listen to their ""edgy"" rock music. The Lament Configuration is broken off the pillar and destroys a club-goer, leading TV reporter Joey Summerskill to hunt down the truth and discover the horror of Pinhead and the Cenobites.When Kirsty revealed the truth to Pinhead at the end of the second movie it separated his human side from his Cenobite half, creating two individual entities. Now, without the balance of his suppressed humanity, Pinhead is unbounded and free to create as much mayhem as he wants.With the move from hardcore British cult horror to shiny, hip, Hollywood the movie is considerably less scary and much goofier. Pinhead's make-up has been slightly altered to make him look less intense and now with a slight overbite which makes him look, dare I say, cute. But make no mistake, Doug Bradley OWNS this role once more and the entire movie. Given a LOT more to do this time around he is the best thing in it. His monster army is very silly and the movie eventually becomes quite cartoonish but the plot is good and it is very fast-paced.Christopher Young didn't return to give the score some much-needed grace but composer nobody has ever heard of, Randy Miller, steps in and recycles Young themes with some of his own generic filler.The intention was to make this gruesome franchise appeal to mass audiences and, in that regard, it's a perfectly fine popcorn flick.",Hellraiser III - Hell on Earth

The story is more complex and rounded, effects are better, there are several really memorable scenes, and Pinhead got a bigger portion of the screen-time than in the past, which allowed Doug Bradley to shine. The movie, of course, has its drawbacks, such as a meaningless slaughter in the nightclub, that conflicts with the rules set in the previous films, but I think that on the beam scale quality side heavily outweighs the one with flaws.7,5/10",Hellraiser III - Hell on Earth

34,tomgillespie2002,Turns the work of a visionary into a money-grubbing franchise,4,8 May 2016,"In 1987, Clive Barker brought to the cinema screen a vision of horror and degradation that was tightly wound around a fascinating mythology of sadomasochistic demons from another world who questioned our own desire for the ultimate pleasure. It is no understatement to say Hellraiser changed horror, and its inspiration is still clear to see in modern horror, although none I've seen possess the ability to truly get under your skin (but thankfully not rip it apart) as Barker's film does. A franchise always beckoned and its first sequel, Hellbound, tried to develop its universe further but ended up a good-looking mess.Hell on Earth signalled the series' rapid decline in quality and imagination. Ambitious young reporter Joey Summerskill (Terry Farrell) is searching for that one big story to help project her career forward. While she wraps up a dull story at a hospital, a man covered in blood with metal chains protruding from his body held up by an unseen entity is rushed in, and is brutally ripped apart just as he is placed on the operating table. Knowing this could be her big break, she tracks down the woman who fled the hospital, Terri (Paula Marshall), and discovers her at a club ran by a slimeball named J.P. Monroe (Kevin Bernhardt), who has recently purchased a stone pillar possessing the trapped soul of Cenobite Pinhead (Doug Bradley).Hellbound, for all its flaws, at least attempted to further establish the mythology, giving us glimpses of Pinhead before he opened the lament configuration. Although Pinhead appears in his human form, dressed in World War I attire, we learn little about his history, and combined with the horror icon's inexplicable new found love of quips and shouting, Hell on Earth feels completely disconnected from the films that came before. It's also cheap- looking, in particular a scene which sees Joey fleeing from Pinhead and his fresh-out-the-oven new Cenobite recruits is badly edited, consisting of feeble explosions while the unconvincing Farrell screams repeatedly. Surely an embarrassment for Barker, Hell on Earth contorted the idea of a visionary into money-grubbing franchise.",Hellraiser III - Hell on Earth

Unfortunately, ""Hellraiser III: Hell on Earth"" was not better than the second and of course not better than the first ""Hellraiser"" movie. There were not any surprises or plot twists to make this movie interesting and the interpretations of the cast were worse than the two previous movies.

37,Anonymous_Maxine,"Hellraiser III is by far the best of the series so far. It is the first one that has any decent acting (although still not great), good direction, and even a fairly respectable story.",8,8 November 2000,"Pinhead has returned, and again he wants to destroy that pesky puzzle box, the door to Hell, so that he will never have to go back. His return to the world of the living is fascinatingly done with an updated version of that horrific rotating pillar that we're all so familiar with by this point. Kevin Bernhardt plays J.P. Monroe, an arrogant night club owner (the `Boiler Room') who is at first persuaded by Pinhead (still trapped in the stone pillar) to help him come fully back to life in the traditional Hellraiser manner. As is to be expected, not everything goes perfectly as planned, and the ensuing madness is both sickening and morbidly entertaining.
Ashley Laurence has been mercifully removed from the cast (probably saving the film from failing like the first two did), except for a thankfully brief cameo in which her character is referred to in order to learn about the history of the box and to prove its capabilities. Hellraiser III gives the series a much needed jump-start, following a weak but cult classic original, as well as an even weaker first sequel. Unfortunately, the `Female Cenobite' (mysteriously left unnamed), `Chatterer,' and `Butterball' (both of whom probably SHOULD have been left unnamed) are gone, but a series of about half a dozen new Cenobites keeps the hellish imagery alive. I think that one of the better elements of this installment in the series is that they show all of the new Cenobites being created. However, when Doc becomes a Cenobite (`Camerahead'), some of his dialogue refers to his life as a human, contradicting the previously established characteristic of the Cenobites that they don't remember their human selves.In the anti-religious tradition of the Hellraiser series (remember `Jesus Wept,' from part I? That was by far my favorite), some of Pinhead's antics in the church near the end of the film are great. When the priest holds up the cross to him, Pinhead melts it in the poor guy's hand, which is a terribly cruel thing to do, but at the same time he utters an absolutely brilliant bit of dialogue, `Thou shalt not bow down to any graven image.' Words to live by, people. After that, Pinhead's self-crucifixion scene was wonderfully sickening, yet his intentions in doing that were both clearly presented and morbidly farcical. Jesus was crucified, paying for man's sins, thereby saving mankind from damnation and becoming the subject of countless masses of people's unquestioning adoration, inspiring Pinhead to crucify himself and state that `I am the way.' This is great stuff.
Besides all that, I think that this installment had some of the best death scenes of the series so far, particularly in the nightclub. Some of that was almost physically painful to watch, a sure sign of success for a horror film. Not only was that Boiler Room massacre convincingly portrayed, but writer Peter Atkins also had the excellent idea to have poor Terri walk through the masses of mutilated bodies after the massacre had ended. Pretty uplifting stuff, huh? A little too gory and bloody? Don't moan about that, it's not supposed to be good, clean, fun. This is a horror film, and by definition, horror films are supposed to be horrible. And Hellraiser III achieves this horror better than either of the two that preceded it, finally leaving the viewer satisfied. Even when you think you are watching what will be a cheesy ending, a plot twist makes it good again, saving us (and the film, technically) from a goofy and patronizing happily-ever-after.' This was a very good horror film. It's almost worth watching the first two just to get to this one, and hopefully this unexpected but very welcome upward trend will continue with the rest of the series.",Hellraiser III - Hell on Earth

Though this third installment, does show signs of wearing, it still packs quite a punch, where it seems to have eased up on the violence some, that's if comparing it to number 2 which was all out, in vast supply. There is still a bloody lot of gore, but it's not as graphic like in it's predecessor. (chains have never looked more scary) This Hellraiser is remotely different from the other two. This one's more modern, if with a wooden plot tacked on around the gore, what have you. Here Pinhead has escaped. His box has ended up in this statuette that this young gigolo, nightclub owner, JJ ,has bought. So we know what is to ensue. The p..sed off girlfriend, (Paula Marshall) ends up at this female journalist's place, investigating this big story, where soon it's them against the forces of evil with Pinhead taking it out onto the street in an explosive finale. Hellraiser fans will still like this one, where others there will be varied opinions. We have a nice little sex too with rose giving JJ, before the sweet little thing becomes Pinheads, and JJ's mouth is agape with shock.",Hellraiser III - Hell on Earth
39,FiendishDramaturgy,Coffee with Pinhead.,8,13 September 2004,"This was the definitive movie in the Hellraiser series in that it defined Pinhead as the ultimate nemesis whereas before, Frank held that role.Many critics have stated that this movie was totally unnecessary within the series, but I beg to differ. It explained who and what Pinhead was, introduced you to his character in a much more satisfying way, and allowed the viewer to develop a bond with his charismatic persona; both as human and as demon.These factors are quite necessary if this series is to continue. Terry Farrel and Paula Marshall (of Warlock: The Armageddon and Steve Martin's surprise 2004 summer hit ""Cheaper By The Dozen"") both contributed their best work (Paula Marshall was just hitting the big screen), rendering solid performances.This movie will be somewhat of a disappointment for splatter fans as it is not the bloodiest of the line. While this may not be the bloodiest (but it is quite bloody) or most action-filled installment, it is most necessary in following the story line and flow of the gruesome nightmare journey into Hell that is Hellraiser.It rates an 8.2/10 from...the Fiend :.",Hellraiser III - Hell on Earth

42,a_baron,Hellraiser III: Hell On Earth,6,1 December 2015,"The third instalment of the ""Hellraiser"" franchise begins with a reporter the big story continues to elude until one night at the hospital she witnesses something supernatural and inexplicable. The mischievous cube has returned and is wreaking havoc. Then one of the creatures behind it offers a character named JP the chance to join up with it; at first JP is reluctant, he lures girls into his inner sanctum with flattery, and once he has had his way with his conquest of the night, gives her her marching orders. He may be a jerk of the first order, but murder for pleasure is not his style, even though the entity reminds him he murdered his own parents!JP agrees to go along with it but the partnership doesn't last long because after he tries to feed his next conquest to it, she punches him out with a knuckle dustered fist, and takes his place. After that it all gets a bit confusing, as if it hadn't been already, but if you like gore, special effects and pyrotechnics, you should find something in the last twenty minutes or so of interest, and if you like the type of music one usually associates with films of this nature, you might like the soundtrack too, especially the title song by Motörhead.",Hellraiser III - Hell on Earth
43,Witchfinder-General-666,The Decline of the Cenobites begins...,4,20 March 2009,"***SPOILERS*** The ""Hellraiser"" franchise is probably one of the most ingenious ideas ever in Horror cinema, but sadly it is also the proof that ingenious Horror formulas usually decline with each sequel. Clive Barker's ""Hellraiser"" of 1987 was an absolute masterpiece of Horror and positively one of the most terrifying films ever brought to screen. The 1988 sequel ""Hellbound: Hellraiser II"" was not quite en par with its predecessor, but still a great and genuinely scary Horror film with an incredible atmosphere, terrifying infernal villains and ultra-gruesome gore effects. This third film in the series, ""Hellraiser III: Hell On Earth"" of 1992 only keeps up on the gore, but sadly not on atmosphere and suspense, and is an ideal example of how the 90s were the decade which generally marked the decline of the Horror genre.I wouldn't necessarily call ""Hell On Earth"" a bad film as such, but I simply find it annoying to an infuriating point how the film detaches the creepiness of its predecessors. The settings of part 1 and 2 were Hellish beyond comparison, the epitome of an original and highly terrifying vision of cinematic Hell. This third part is suddenly set mainly in a club where a bunch of idiots dance to bad music and pseudo-macabre decoration. The first face that is seen in the film is that of club-owner J.P. Monroe (Kevin Bernhardt), and from the very first second, I couldn't wait for that idiot to die a violent death. The guy buys a morbidly-looking sculpture, which is - surprise! - a hideout in which Pinhead and his fellow Cenobites are waiting to be awoken... The majority of the other characters are not much less annoying. The only slightly likable human character is the female lead Joanne, played by Terry Farell, and that's only because she's pretty hot. The worst thing about ""Hell On Earth"", however, is the decline of the iconic character of Lead Cenobite Pinhead (Doug Bradley). As it was the case in so many other Horror films in the 90s, the makers of this film obviously felt the necessity of giving one of the most terrifying Horror villains a 'funny' touch - which completely destroys the gruesome greatness of the character. They even felt the need to make a 'good' counterpart to Pinhead - the person he was before becoming a demon. Also, Pinhead's persona is turned upside-down as he laughs all the time in this one - another aspect which lessens the creepiness of the character. Even so, Pinhead is still by far the most memorable aspect of this film. Another aspect in which this is still exceptional is the ultra-gruesome and genuinely sadistic gore. Gore alone isn't everything, though. Among other unnecessary aspects, ""Hell On Earth"" adds many superficially 'coool' elements like blue cyber-rays or a Cenobite with a Camera coming out of his eye. Ouch! Overall, this review may sound a bit too pessimistic. As said above, the film isn't all THAT bad, and it definitely has its entertaining moments. It is just so unspeakably inferior to its predecessors that it is hard to point out any positive points. It is still better than most of the sequels to come, but the lack of scariness and the travesty of the original is hard to forgive.",Hellraiser III - Hell on Earth
44,breakdownthatfilm-blogspot-com,Beginning to lack charm,5,2 August 2013,"Clive Barker's Hellraiser (1987) is considered by many to be one of the most unique horror films of the late 80's. What emphasized those opinions were gruesome images along with its Gothic tone. A year later, New World Pictures released Hellraiser II: Hellbound (1988) and although it wasn't as critically praised, it still resonated with many fans. I found it enjoyable but the writing was much weaker than I had expected it to be. Then, jump four years later and we get Hellraiser III: Hell on Earth (1992), which to many just didn't satisfy and bordered on the edge of really bad. The sad thing is that, it is bad, even with the few good things it has going for it.The plot is about a ""down on their luck"" news reporter, Joey (Terry Farrell), who can't find a decent story to save her career. That is, until she comes into contact with the lament configuration after watching a hospital patient's head explode. Amazingly after being okay with such a traumatizing experience, this intrigues her more to find out what this tiny puzzle box is all about. To do this, she digs into the past using archives from Dr. Channard's mental asylum and interview footage of Kirsty Cotton. It is also explained to why Pinhead is back in this movie because in the movie before, he was killed off. This is one of the better parts, at least when it comes to the back-story and continuity. Peter Atkins, the same writer of Hellraiser II: Hellbound (1988), wrote the screenplay. I'll admit, it's very much appreciated that Atkins' is keeping the continuity straight. If that wasn't at least on track, my rating would probably be lower. But even so, Atkins' ability to give explanations to why this mystical puzzle box decides to make various humans cenobites, and others not, makes no sense. Is it just by random chance? The cast on the other hand is another bowl of mixed nuts. It's great to see that the casting department had Ashley Laurence come back for a small cameo in the asylum footage and of course Doug Bradley as Pinhead himself. That was great, but the main lead, Terry Farrell wasn't. Farrell just didn't make her character come off as a strong female lead, no matter how many times one says ""Go to hell!"".Unfortunately, dialog is another problem. I don't know what Atkins was thinking when it came to dialog, but almost every character here (and maybe even a little bit of Doug Bradley's lines) all have this sarcastic if not watered down dialog that makes them sound like these lines were written for a bad comedy. The Hellraiser franchise is not a comedy, not even a dark comedy, so why are characters making bad puns or being overly sarcastic? Even some of the new cenobites have corny dialog. For example, any female besides Joey (Farrell) wasn't that smart in speech or actions. What's up with that? It wasn't necessary then and it isn't now.Let's not forget though, this is a horror franchise so there will be plenty of death, blood and ugly images. And for those who wish to see that, yes, you will get your eye full worth without a doubt. But, if you're the viewer looking for the same kind of tone and chills you felt from Hellraiser (1987), it won't be found here. Even more surprising is how absent Randy Miller's score to the film was. I was actually impressed with his work from both Darkman II: The Return of Durant (1995) and Darkman III: Die Darkman Die (1996) because he not only made sure he stuck to the original theme, but added some unique tracks to them as well. Here however, right from the intro credits is Christopher Young's music! It's not to say Miller didn't provide anything, because I know there were tunes in there I never heard before but it seemed like most of the music was just recycled and edited. It's sad when a composer comes off as sounding lazy – especially if they aren't that bad to begin with. It's not to say this movie doesn't pull through, but its original tone and atmosphere of the picture no longer exists which makes it depressing that a franchise so likable is beginning to lose its charm. It's beginning to get to a point where the only reason why someone would want to watch this is for Pinhead alone. But Doug Bradley can't carry this picture by himself. Otherwise it would've worked from the first installment.The third entry is much lighter in atmosphere and doesn't carry itself the way the first two did. The continuity is thankfully kept in order but the dialog isn't too clever and the only real character that's worth a watch is Pinhead himself.",Hellraiser III - Hell on Earth
45,p-stepien,Hell to earth... please send in script doctor,5,9 January 2010,"Hellraiser was quite the franchise back in the days and I decided to revisit the world of the Cenobites and the Pinhead phenomenon. The first part had all the terror, but fell apart when it mattered most (the ending was atrocious). Hellbound improved on the script and had some great memorable scenes, but all in all was just too chaotic and amateurishly written to really captivate. Hell on Earth filmed several years later is a step up from part II, but a long way away from being a good movie.This part focuses mostly on Pinhead (Doug Bradley) as he tries to escape the confines of his realm of hell and traverse into our world. The means of achieving this is through the sculpture that emerges at the end of Hellbound. There to stop him is Joanne (Terry Farrell), a failing news anchor with high aspirations, but not much luck. Unfortunately for her Pinhead has already broken into our world and is ready to introduce torture that this world has yet to see...This movie very much focuses in Pinhead, the break out character of the series and in some sense Doug Bradley is the sole reason that this movie is any good. No matter how crappy lines he receives he sells them with such conviction and evil that you find the whole scenario believable. The back-up cast is relatively fine, albeit visibly C-class actors, so Bradley really shines amongst mediocrity.There are some nice lines in this one, albeit all too often the script dives head-first into banal corny directions making several scenes of horror a bit laughable, instead of scary. The most idiotic cop-out by the script concerns Pinhead being a bad-ass killer throughout, but suddenly becomes as harmless as a poodle with rabies when Joanne is the target. On the plus side for the scriptwriter someone finally tried to introduce some set of rules which reign in the world of Cenobites and the mysterious cube. Not all of it makes sense, but at least the film seems to have more focus and doesn't derail as Hellbound did.The last third of the movie is really a let-down, after a quite nice build to the culmination. Suddenly we have goofy Cenobites popping up all over the place. Unfortunately they provoke laughter and not fright as all of the Cenobites from the first two parts did. Enough said that you have a DJ Cenobite, a cameraman Cenobite and a barman Cenobite... Basically this causes the movie to take a turn for the worse into bad 80s horrormovieland...Surprisingly after 4 years the special effects seem to be worse than in the original. The first two parts actually withheld time rather well, whilst in this one you can't help notice how out-dated some of the effects are. That said the sculpture is done brilliantly and several scenes may make you cringe in a good way.To finish on a high note: The end scene is pure brilliance.",Hellraiser III - Hell on Earth
46,vengeance20,Slightly Better than I & II,5,3 November 2016,"So again I watch this film for the 2nd time in 3 years & again, only remember little bits & pieces due to the lack of interest. Though this one was slightly better than the first 2 it still didn't have an interesting enough of a story despite the change from the first 2 films.This film focuses on a art collector who buys a statue with the Lament Configuration on it along with Pinhead himself. The film focuses on Pinhead & his orgins along with the cenobites in the previous installment as they're revealed to be all human or once before they were transformed. It focuses on how pinhead was once a sgt. in the air force back in the 1920's before he came across the Puzzle Box & was turned evil. He himself asks to be freed from the evil or at least for it to be destroyed.I found the film to be quite decent & had some gory bloody visuals as always. I furthermore, liked the ending climaxed scene with the normal humans who were cenobites walking down the street terrorising everybody! That was great being honest & aside form a few gorgeous actresses here & there. It was more action packed & had a bit more going for it. Though sadly it still wasn't iconic enough.I'd give this film a 5.5 out of 10, it was like I said slightly better then the first 2 installments. But just not enough for it to be totally iconic.",Hellraiser III - Hell on Earth
47,Zbigniew_Krycsiwiki,Quick thoughts on this one.,7,14 February 2018,"If one can overlook the needless steps toward mild comedy, and a more mainstream feel to this entry, it can be a gruesomely good time, with Doug Bradley in fine form as the s&m demon from Hell, now known as Pinhead. His entrance in the church, as well as his subsequent monologue, is chilling. A horrifying image of him, briefly losing his control, as he shoves the cross off the altar, before, arms outstretched, he then calmly, intensely declares, "" I am the way "" , immediately before the Gothic windows explode, is the film's most memorable scene. The movie veers off into action film explosions at one time, in a simultaneously out of place, and also fun, scene.If only the filmmakers would have dropped the cameraman's annoying attempts at humour ( every time he answers his brick-sized cell phone, he annoyed says, "" Speak. "" Seriously? How did that cringe-inducing line make it past the first draught of the script? )",Hellraiser III - Hell on Earth
48,TedStixonAKAMaximumMadness,"""Hellraiser III: Hell on Earth""- An entertaining but generally disappointing mess. Worth watching once for its amusingly dated style and a handful of fun scenes.",3,22 October 2016,"I guess they must get Mtv down in Hell, huh? Because without doubt, if there's any way to describe director Anthony Hickox's ""Hellraiser III: Hell on Earth"", it's this: This is the 90's alt-rock, music video variation of the franchise. It's practically oozing of all things early 90's. Over-stylized, kinetic visuals where the cameras zoom and flow about like an over-caffeinated bird. Odd transitional fashion trends that feel like the dying throes of the 80's. Amusingly dated optical and early digital effects that would look out of place just a couple years later. So much grunge. Jaded punk- rock mindsets of rebellion against ""conformity."" And on-the-nose visuals and commentary that seem jarringly out-of-place.Yes, this is certainly a ""Hellraiser"" from the early 90's.Some time after the events of the previous film, the mysterious ""Pillar of Souls"" is purchased by spoiled-brat nighclub owner J.P. Monroe (Kevin Bernhardt), who soon enough realizes that it houses the eternal evil of the demonic cenobite Pinhead, once again portrayed with delightful depravity by Doug Bradley. As Pinhead manipulates Monroe to bring him sacrifices so that he may be freed, reporter Joey Summerskill (Terry Farrell) begins to piece together the backstory of Pinhead, realizing that his soul has been fractured into two pieces... the evil and unrestrained Pinhead and the much more sympathetic British Army Captain Elliot Spencer. And thus, Summerskill must go on a dark and twisted journey to stop the now-freed Pinhead, and reunite the two halves of his spirit in order to restore balance and stop him.Written by Peter Atkins and Tony Randel, the script is a bit of a tangled swarm of notions and ideas that on paper may sound fascinating and hard-hitting, but don't come together as any sort-of cohesive whole. At times, the narrative is lost in what feels like a swirling storm of half-baked sequences, where story and character development takes a backseat to action-oriented set-pieces and buckets of blood. You really do get the feeling that somewhere behind-the-scenes was a producer standing over the two, forcibly making them eject key sequences from the script and demanding the insertion of new scenes specifically modeled after music-videos and video-game advertisements... all in a desperate attempt to appeal to the youth demographic who might have found the previous films ""boring."" I really can't imagine it happening any other way, especially after their much strong, earlier work on the second film in the series. And it all comes down to a story that feels like it was created to sell soundtrack albums and novelty t-shirts for High School students first... and to tell a compelling story second.Director Anthony Hickox seems a bit in over-his-head here. While I'm not overly familiar with his previous work, his guidance of scenes and character feels a bit too ""off."" Like he's easily distracted. This is especially true of the slower and more deliberate sequences of dialog and character development, which feel very disjointed and sloppy. I can't help but get the feeling he's afraid of losing his audience, so he instructed everyone to over-emphasize their words and move in big, broad motions. It's frankly bizarre at times. One of the more amusing sequences being a key scene where Pinhead is first revealed to Monroe, which feels both boring and over-the-top all at once. Only later in the film when things really start to go crazy does he start to get a handle on things and seem more confident in his visual choices... but he's still far too blatant for his own good, lending to a feeling of disconnect from the intended horror. It's too much like you're watching a low-budget action-picture... it stops being scary when every scene has the camera zoom or turn to a dutch-tilt or end with a quippy one-liner from our villain.Outside of that, the rest of the production really is a disappointing mess. Outside of Bradley, the performances are all uniformly bland, with far too much over acting and smart-alec dialog for you to really care. The new music cues by Randy Miller are very forgettable, with only the returning themes composed by Christopher Young standing out. The editing is jarring and gives you a sense of whiplash, as it's cut with lightning faces pacing- again in an attempt to make this a ""Hellraiser"" for the Mtv crowd. And even the cinematography seems a bit uninspired. It's just... sub-par in essentially every way conceivable.Still, all of that being said, I can't help but feel this is still worth watching for series fans. It may sound paradoxical after all of my droning complaints above. But there's just such a fun and frenetic sense of entertainment value on display that I can't completely dismiss the movie. It's bad... Oh, it's bad! But it's bad in that way that you'll still have a big grin on your face while you scoff and roll your eyes over how stupid it all is. And I think a lot of that has to do with the delightfully dated quality it has as an early-90's release. It's never boring. The aesthetic style and camera-work can be a lot of fun to watch. You'll certainly get a lot of laughs from the misplaced humor and wildly over-the-top characters and gore effects. And there are a select handful of scenes that do work in their own silly, demented ways. It's not the high art of Clive Barker's iconic original. Nor is it the twisted labyrinthine puzzle that was ""Hellbound: Hellraiser II."" No, this is just plain-old ""dumb fun."" Filler fluff that's good for a gasp and a laugh on a slow, rainy day when you don't have to go to work and wanna just veg-out watching some visual junk-food.

And the cast, not because they were good, but because I recently watched Paper Dolls series and knew Paula Marshall from other movies and TV shows.

52,Stephen_A_Abell,"Needed More... Though, Not A Bad Film...",7,7 March 2018,"Here's part three of the Hellraiser Saga... Once again this continues from where the last film ended, though it's a looser connection. The battle between Pinhead (Bradley) and his original human self, Captain Elliott Spencer, allowed him to break free of hells shackles. Entrapped in a monolith, he is awoken by Sandy (Leigh), when an accidental cut splashes blood on his stone features. Revealing himself to JP Monroe (Bernhardt), an unscrupulous womanising club owner, Pinhead makes a deal to free himself from his confines and to help JP to achieve his dreams...This leads to lots of twists and turns in the storyline as you know you can't trust a daemon. The only thing which stands in his way is an aspiring investigative reporter, Joanne ""Joey"" Summerskill (Farrell), who's investigating the gory and violent murders which are appearing in the city.The first thing that becomes evident is the amount of budget available for this film. Instead of being kept within the confines of a house or a hospital, now we're out in New York City. Penthouses, apartments, clubs, restaurants, ally's and streets. The locations are so much bigger. This is good, as it gives scope for a larger story with more hellish violence and gore... and it nearly delivers. Nearly, because the scene where the Cenobites finally take to the streets is actually underwhelming. What was required were a few more Cenobites and quite a few more victims, both pedestrians and police. It's nice to have explosions... I just wanted more.The acting is okay, Bradley still stands out and is excellent as Pinhead. Farrell does a good job as the reporter. However, it's Bernhardt and Marshall, who plays Terri, who have their bouts of woodenness. The direction too is quite different from the first two, gone are the artistic and atmospheric lighting for a more natural feel. This is okay, but the film does lose a little of its mood and spirit, which added strength to the first two movies. I can understand the need for doing this. If you expand the daemons universe to include a lot more of reality then it stands to reason to get that feeling across would be to lose the more imaginative aspects of the filmmaking. That said there are still quite a few iconic shots, such as the entrance of Pinhead at the club and later in the church, and nicely thought out camera shots and angles.Though I didn't find it as good as the first films it's still as enjoyable, though for different reasons... and as Pinhead would attain, variety is the spice of life.Another good thing is that this film actually works as a stand-alone, you only need a vague idea about the previous stories; whereas, Hellbound actually made you feel as though you should have watched the first film before viewing. So for that reason, I would recommend this to all horror fans and newbies alike. This is a well written, structured, and acted film... which has its fair share of tension, fear, and suspense.",Hellraiser III - Hell on Earth

Netflix streamed this film in 1.33 aspect, despite the fact that the film was shot in 1.85. This means visual information was literally cut off.Sound: 8/10 Music was composed for the film by Randy Miller, plus music from a number of rock acts was included. Some of the club scene 'live' music was pretty good.Acting: 4/10 I liked Terry Farrell as Jadzia Dax in Star Trek: DS9, but not so much here. To make it worse, the movie made a poor attempt to convert the actress into being a blonde. Doug Bradley was fine as usual. Paula Marshall I could have done without. Kevin Bernhardt showed all the talent of a bad high school actor.Screenplay: 2/10 The character Terri could knock out JP with one short jab? Give me a break. There's a whole lot less here in terms of story and motivation than in the first two. The feeling of suspense, menace, and what-happens-next was considerably less. The carnage at the club was less affecting than the more personal horrors in the first and second films.SFX: 3/10 Very little special here.

57,ivo-cobra8,Underrated solid a decent best third sequel to the Hellraiser horror flick franchise - I love it!,10,20 March 2016,"Hellraiser III: Hell on Earth (1992) is my second favorite in the trilogy of Hellraisers. I know this film get's a lot of hate, I know it is not a classic, but I seriously love this movie to death, I never thought it was that bad. In my opinion Hellraiser III is very decent third good sequel that it is actually a real horror flick and it is not a fantasy like was the second movie. I still love this movie mainly because of actress Terry Farrell which she did of one her best acting performances as the main heroine reporter Joanne 'Joey' Summerskill. Terry Farrel did a TERRIFIC job as the main heroine in this film that I love to death. The film was filmed in New York which you can see the twin towers from here, we finally see Pinhead the leader of the Cenobites been an evil monster like he is, unlike he was a friend to Kirsty (Ashley Laurence). He wanted to destroyed the world and I loved that, I love that they show what the new Cenobites can do, they were killing people. I love the flashbacks and dreams sequences on a Vietnam war. I love Doug Bradley playing to characters one as Pinhead and the second one as Captain Elliot Spencer that reveals the story to Joey (Terry Farrell) to what happened with him. I also love that Ashley Laurence has a special appearance in here in a video cameo.Plot: An investigative reporter must send the newly unbound Pinhead and his legions back to Hell.They should have ended the series with the trilogy, by this film, I don't care about the next sequels, I don't care about the Bloodline movie. I think Hellraiser III: Hell on Earth is the last decent film in the franchise that I Love, I will definitely never watch Hellraiser: Bloodline or any other Hellraiser movies I will only stick with this film.About the plot a reporter Joey Summerskill becomes a witness in a hospital of unusual death of a young man. So she try's to get a story behind it, so she finds the girl Terri (Paula Marshall) and she try's to help's her out, but the owner and her ex boyfriend J.P. Monroe (Kevin Bernhardt) rules her back in to his dark world, while try to sacrifice her, to the Pinhead statue, but that backfires at him. I love that Pinhead get's resurrected and he get's his army of cenobites back on this world. Joey is the only one that can defeats him and she does. I disagree with all the haters about this film, it is a great horror flick and it does have a happy ending. For the 90's this movie worked for me. Loads of excitement are gore all around. And a good story to boot. Doug Bradley was great playing both roles, and Pinhead was definitely a bad ass in this flick. I love Terry Farrell as the lead heroine in this flick.I think the speed of it is better than the others, and has a slasher feel. Pinhead lost to a cenobite in the second one, so it loses points for that to me. They made Pinhead into more of a monster here. It works. With the split and all it makes sense. The acting from all the cast is decent, the special effects are good and they aren't terribly. The story ark is good and the a action on the end of the movie is fantastic. I love that Joey runs in to a church while Pinhead was chasing her it was fantastic, when Pinhead re encounters a priest. This movie is really different horror film from the first two but it is still a decent! Director Anthony Hickox did a solid job as the director, he shot the camera perfectly. The Boiler Room Club massacre was also a great horror shot scene that I liked and I still love what the movie shows what other Cenobites can do, like they were using CD's for a blades and were cutting people awesome. I also love the night scenes when the final battle was showed.Overall: This movie isn't the best or a classic like the first two were, but it is a solid and decent film to watch worth of a time. It is not boring it fast paced and well acted. I love this movie and mostly I love Terry Farrell in this flick I love her. Hellraiser III: Hell on Earth get's a solid 10 by me.Hellraiser III: Hell on Earth is a 1992 American-Canadian horror film and third installment in the Hellraiser series, directed by Anthony Hickox and starring Doug Bradley, Terry Farrell, Paula Marshall, and Kevin Bernhardt.10/10 Grade: Bad Ass Seal Of Approval Studio: Dimension Films Starring: Doug Bradley, Terry Farrell, Paula Marshall, Kevin Bernhardt Director: Anthony Hickox Producers: Christopher Figg, Lawrence Mortorff, Clive Barker Screenplay: Peter Atkins, Tony Randel Based on characters by Clive Barker Rated: R Running Time: 1 Hr. 33 Mins.

58,fernandoschiavi,"Despite its flaws (which are not few), for those who liked the first two, it deserves a look because the film serves as the last chapter to the trilogy",5,15 August 2021,"Twenty-five years ago, the third part of the Hellraiser franchise came to American cinemas, which still had a long way to go. The first two films were fairly moderately successful and still managed to gather a huge legion of fans, who loved the whole bizarre and sickening world of the story. So, the intention of Hellraiser 3 would be something similar to Jason Attacks Manhattan (1989) and Predator 2 (1990), that is, to bring an evil previously contained in a relatively small location to the big city. Which isn't an entirely bad idea, although the first one barely took it and the second one did very well. It's interesting because it gives a greater sense of ""calamity"", which usually results in a lot of fun scenes.The film opens with J. P. (Kevin Bernhardt), a nightclub owner, visiting a museum where the totem pole is being displayed. Remember that weird beggar who always appeared in previous movies? Well, here he is back, selling the item to the guy. At the same time, we meet Joey (Terry Farrell), a reporter looking for a big scoop. She ends up in a hospital where she comes across a man who comes into an emergency, covered in blood and chains. His death doesn't take long and Joey realizes there's something wrong there. She looks for the girl who accompanied him, Terri (Paula Marshall), whose ex-boyfriend is exactly J. P. The young man at the hospital was a stranger she had seen dying in the club holding an unknown box, which she now owns. The two then begin an investigation in search of the object's origin. That's when J. P. wakes up Pinhead...It is inherent in the process of transforming a film into a franchise that starts an almost endless cineseries, as happened with Friday the 13th and Nightmare on Elm Street, for example. The big difference between the aforementioned slashers and the film based on the work of Clive Barker, which started in the eternal classic Hellraiser - Reborn from Hell, is that the footprint here has always been darker and more visceral than other 1980s films, and Pinhead is a character much more evil, powerful, profound and philosophical than their peer's movie maniacs. That, and the whole creation of a dimension of pleasure and pain populated by creatures as bizarre as the Cenobites is a point that puts Hellraiser one rung up the ladder.Hellraiser III - Hell on Earth exactly trivializes all of this and drops the franchise from this step, which would no longer be able to reach again in the features that are produced practically until today. From an atmospheric, dirty, perverse movie, there's a caricature with pathetic action and chase scenes, actors with depressing performances, weird new cenobites and a completely mediocre story. At least the sequel does well to follow a new path for the franchise, establishing some criteria that would last until the end of the saga. The problem is just that they have chosen a generic approach to a story as rich in detail as Hellraiser's. Another point that greatly impoverishes the production is the script that is full of prepations in the dialogues. When moving to the screen, director Anthony Hickox doesn't even try to soften and ends up delivering some horrible scenes, where even a simple one goes like ""Oh no, gas!"" It seems exaggerated! This ends up hindering the performance of almost the entire cast.Overall, Hellraiser III is quite intense in violence, featuring five new cenobites after previous ones Chatterer, Butterball and Female were destroyed in the previous film. The new infernal creatures are three men, one with several CD's stuck in his head, another with a video camera serving as an eye, and the last one with a constantly moving mechanical device inside the brain, as well as two women, one of them with barbed wire covering her face and spewing fire from her mouth like one of those mythological dragons, and another with a lit cigarette dangling from an exposed opening in her throat.Another highlight scene is when Pinhead in a killing frenzy literally massacres everyone in the club, mercilessly, in one of the many graphic scenes in this third part. People are killed in every way and liters and liters of blood run down the screen. Only Joey, who is in possession of the cube, after being properly instructed in a dream by Captain Elliot Spencer, who is actually Pinhead's human form before deciphering the object and having turned into the devil, can face the fetish guy. However, there is a chase scene (which is quite long indeed) that looks like a B-movie, with things exploding, policemen shooting, power lines pumping electricity into the water gushing from fire hydrants. Until then, the cenobites' attacks have been discreet and focused, focusing on the victims they want to barter their souls and torture for all eternity. Here it becomes a circus show of exaggerated rascality.But luckily we have Pinhead to save the movie. Finally, Doug Bradley lets loose like the villain, and we see all his malice, all his disdain for the human soul and his mediocrity, howled in dark, sarcastic, mocking words. The most emblematic moment of Hellraiser III - Hell on Earth is the church sequence, in which Pinhead enters the place, attacks Joey and the parish priest, and even blasphemes heavily against the Catholic Church, stopping at the altar, pulling out two of its nails of the head and nailing his hands, imitating Christ in an offensive way, saying ""I am the way"", and then making the priest swallow his ""flesh and blood"" in a kind of damned communion. It's a unique moment in the franchise. Speaking of Pinhead, its pre-Cenobite history is fully explored here. Previously, Kirsty had ""separated"" the Pinhead from Captain Elliot Spencer (his human identity) and now, Elliot helps Joey through dreams she constantly has. It even has a certain resemblance to some plots of A Hora do Nightmare!The end of Hellraiser III - Hell on Earth already leaves room for another sequel, which we know came, and in a cart. A shame this trivialization of a villain and such an interesting concept, which remained until the second part. But horror movies are like that: sequels and sequels with virtually zero quality, extrapolating a formula that worked. Clive Barker's universe was the next victim of this cinematographic movement, and that, is to suffer more than eternity trapped in the unbearable pain of the cenobites' chains and hooks. Despite its flaws (which are not few), for those who liked the first two, it deserves a look because the film brings a lot of cool stuff to the table, serving as the last chapter of the original trilogy! The first half is kind of slow, but once the movie kicks in, it's pure sadism.",Hellraiser III - Hell on Earth
59,Falconeer,"Insultingly stupid ""sequel"" to two horror masterpieces",2,16 February 2007,"There is a fine collectors DVD set from Anchor Bay; The first 3 films in the ""Hellraiser"" series, contained in an awesome replica of the 'Lament Configuration' puzzle box. ""Hellraiser 3: Hell On Earth"", is an embarrassing mess of a film. It has the unfortunate honor of being the first dud in a series that got progressively worse, after two of the finest horror films to emerge from the 80's.The original ""Hellraiser"" is a truly dark, hypnotically evil little film, filled with sadistic sex, grisly violence, and corrupt, sinister characters. It is one of the few films that is still genuinely frightening. Next came ""Hellraiser 2: Hellbound"", a film that is surprisingly great, and in some ways even surpasses it's predecessor, with it's amazing and outrageous imagery, particularly it's unique vision of Hell. And Julia, an even more formidable embodiment of evil, than Frank, of the first one. Then along comes part 3, an Americanized version, watered down and dumbed down by Hollywoods toxic influence. As usual, Hollywood sucks out the power of a horror film, by adding sickening comic overtones. While the original Cenobites were scary and fascinating in their own right, these new cenobites, with names like ""Cd Head,"" and ""Camera Head"", are laughable and stupid. It's like ""Freddy Vs. Jason"", or a bad ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"" episode"", especially towards the end, with the battle of the cenobites in the streets of New York. In fact, from the opening scenes, when it becomes obvious that the location has been shifted from dark and gloomy London, to tacky and trendy 80's New York, I knew that i was in for a disappointment. What the filmmakers failed to realize here, is that the thing that made parts 1 & 2 so special, is that they were pretty much devoid of the ""comic overtones"" crap. Those films were played straight, and deadly serious. They played like horror films for intelligent, thinking adults who take their films, especially horror films seriously. ""Hellraiser 3: Hell On Earth"" is geared towards 13 year old kids who throw popcorn at each other in the mall cineplex. The story is all over the place, and the screenplay is a mess. The only element of the film that possesses any quality is the storyline about the handsome and sinister J.P. Monroe, a sick bastard who killed his parents to inherit their millions. He uses the money to buy an extravagant nightclub, a miniature world where he crowns himself King. He comes to possess the evil statue that houses Pinhead, who employs the corrupt J.P. to feed him young girls, so that he might again become flesh and blood. The J.P. character is good, but he is killed off fairly early, and the movie completely falls apart after. Guess what happens? Lots of dumb American teens get killed. What a profound disappointment for someone who has such great respect for the first two films. For fans of serious horror I do not recommend this trash. The series does not recover itself until ""Inferno,"" the fifth installment, an elegant and stylish film noir study of a corrupt cop who comes across the Lament configuration box. However for fans of the ""Scream"" films, and the countless ""Friday the 13th"" and Nightmare On Elm Street"" sequels, where liberal doses of comedy are mixed in with teens being butchered, they might enjoy this one.",Hellraiser III - Hell on Earth

I've seen it many times. But last time I saw it, last year, it lost its impact. I haven't seen the first in many years, but I remember it as a decent film. I do not consider Hellraiser II as a masterpiece, but it must be seen. My rating for that is a B rating for a B movie, 7 stars. #III in comparison is garbage. And the only reason to see it is if you need to see all the Hellraiser movies. If you're a fan of the II, you will probably hate it. You might as well just see II and call it a day.Here's the main problem. The story sucks. A female reporter sees a death in a hospital by way of chains ripping a person apart. Now, she's the only person investigating this. Where are the cops, and the hospital personnel who witnessed the chains suspended in air ripping the victim apart. By the way, the fx were OK, but much better done in Scanners, or Hellraiser II. Then the reporter speaks to the victim's girlfriend and has a clue to go to the, wait for it, THE BOILER ROOM, a rock/trip club owned by a rich dirtbag who happened to kill his parents for money. Maybe they could have shown a scene of this fool killing his parents, that may have been interesting. Reporter goes to the Boiler and some stupid dialogue and acting follows. In a dream sequence we find out that the reporter lost her father, she never knew, in Vietnam. This bit of ungenius writing comes in handy later as a deception device for Mr. Pinhead. So, I'm not going to go into every little detail of this mess. But the script sucks. If you have a bad script, it can only be saved by the acting, music, and directing. Every element of this film is equal in quality. Everything here is just plain simple mediocre crap. The Pinhead dialogue/one liners are interesting for the first time or two, but gets to be a blabbering nonsense. All the actors are mediocre, except for the cameraman, he sucked. The fx were OK, here and there, but then towards the end we get a bunch of cars exploding and ridiculous nonsense, which adds nothing. The only other thing that saves this movie from complete disaster is Motorhead has a tune or two on it. The film is watchable, but do not expect any thought provoking ideas or even an entertaining film. A few pieces of dialogue from Pinhead, a few fx scenes, a few interesting twists, does not make a movie. These are just elements. The only way I made it through this is by playing some guitar while watching.I got this in a DVD collection, 6 movies for $5, Hellraiser III to VIII. I will only recommend this if you want to see all Hellraiser films. Otherwise watch the first and second and call it a day.Rating D, 3 stars.",Hellraiser III - Hell on Earth
64,Shattered_Wake,"'Hellraiser' without the suspense, tension, or intelligence",6,2 August 2008,"In a city without pain, a reporter, Joey (Terry Farrell), discovers a man being attacked by seemingly alive chains. Before she can get her scoop, the man explodes into a shower of meaty chunks. Hearing the story of a mysterious box, Joey tracks it down to an embarrassingly 90s club called The Boiler Room. There, she finds out that clubgoers are being fed into a pillar by some rich prick (Kevin Bernhardt) to sustain Pinhead (Doug Bradley) in an attempt to bring him and his legion of Cenobites back to the world. It's up to Joey to defeat the Cenobites and send them back to hell where they belong. . . or bring Hell on Earth.In what's obviously the most action-packed of the first three films of the Hellraiser series, Hell on Earth seems to take a turn more for the style of the stalk-and-kill-type slashers, regardless of 1992 being a dead year for the slasher subgenre. All four of the major slasher series (Freddy, Jason, Michael, Chucky) had already reached their break by this point, so it seems that Hellraiser was either too late on becoming a 'slasher'-type film. . . or they just wanted to become a way to fill the void. Either way, while it made for a faster-paced Hellraiser, it did not make for a better one. Now, I'm not saying it's a bad film, because it's not. . . just very mediocre (which is the worst type of film to me). It's an interesting film just to see a new look at the franchise and there's a nice amount of the classic Hellraiser violence, gore, & horror. . . but the painfully good tension of the first two Hellraiser is greatly lost in exchange for all of the action. I would suggest this to fans of the franchise as there's a good amount of Cenobite action and all. . . even though some of the Cenobites are ridiculously dumb (I'm sorry, but CD-head? Gasoline-martini man? C'mon now). But, it's definitely the worst of the first three (the only ones I've seen thus far, but I have IV sitting in front of me ready to be watched & reviewed). . . but it did keep me entertained and that at least allows it to have an average rating.Final verdict: 5.5/10.",Hellraiser III - Hell on Earth
65,baileycrawly,"""A Waste of Good Suffering!""",7,3 March 2020,"Hell on Earth: Hellraiser III is easily the most ""mainstream"" movie.
The story Clive Barker published and later adapted for film was a thrilling story of eternal pain and pleasure, of repressed sexual desire and the darkest wishes of the human heart. It was a ballsy, no-holds-barred story that one doesn't have to look particularly deeply into to see why the story (and subsequent films) were so shocking and disturbing.
Hellraiser III is around the time when things started to go commercial, to cater to the lowest common denominator rather than appealing to the outcasts who were (and still, for the most part, are) misrepresented in the media. It takes a character who loves to push them to the threshold of pain and pleasure and instead become nothing more than a slasher killer. The revival of the character is a tad redundant, the additional story arc with his character (won't say more for fear of spoilers) seemed out of place and would definitely have been a more appropriate fit in the following film.
Hellraiser III was produced on a budget astronomically larger than the original film, and yet the special effects are spotty. It's hard to say whether it's because some of the effects are more ambitious than in previous films, if they spent a ton of money on particular effects and had to cheap out on the rest, or a combination of the two, but some of the special effects in this are not good.
There are some new cenobites who appear in this film as well and, without offering spoilers, it's important to note that they are some of the most ridiculous villains ever conceived in a horror film and not something that would conceivably come from the same brain that gave us The Hellbound Heart just a few years prior.
There's always a demystifying effect with villains, especially in the horror genre. Pinhead was as a clear hit from the time the first film came out (much to the surprise of Clive Barker, who had signed away all the rights to the character). Though he only gets little screen time (and though his presence is as commanding as ever), Pinhead is being demystified. The character who was once a figure that kept many up at night has begun inching his way toward dark comedy in a way he hasn't in the previous films, which is alarming for an individual who has seen more than his fair share of horror franchises go the way of comedy and wind up dead on arrival.
That being said, the infamous climax of this film is still as shocking as it is exciting. Flirting with outright blasphemy, it's a deliciously evil scene that is sure to please any horror fan.
Overall, Hellraiser III is the point in the series at which the cracks begin to show. Where the first two movies were faithful to the story and concepts of the creator of our beloved cenobites, this film throws the lore and canonical details (aside from, of course, the return of Pinhead and a small role from a previous actress in the series) out the door in favor of appeasing the mainstream slasher market of the time who cared more about body counts and creative deaths than content of actual substance.
Hell on Earth isn't a horrible movie. It's not even a horrible Hellraiser movie. But it's not as good as it could've been by any stretch of the imagination.",Hellraiser III - Hell on Earth
66,SkullScreamerReturns,Hellraiser the rock video version,7,13 April 2021,"It's been long since I saw Hellraiser 2 but I liked it about as much as the first one. Part 3 gets the award of third best film in the series (though I still haven't seen all the later parts yet.)For some reason I was under the impression that this movie would have a lot of comedy elements like in later Nightmare on Elm Street films but that wasn't so much the case. Sure it isn't a too serious film (for example there is a cenobite shooting cd's from his head!) but still it was mostly more serious than I expected.Ok, the plot is quite all over the place. I couldn't even describe it. There are certain recurring themes like Pinhead wanting the cube and the father of the lead female character wanting her attention from the other side but it all feels quite random.But the good thing is that I wasn't bored. In fact, I felt like watching a good music video where there is not much plot but visually interesting things happen, and there's always some dramating feeling even though you don't really know why would this weidness have such effect. I guess it's well directed and shot, and the original musical theme from the first film returns, so somehow it all comes together.If you want a movie with a plot that makes a lot of sense, then don't watch this one. But if you're into more abstract stuff that has style over substance, then maybe watch it. Especially if you like rock/metal music. Armored Saint is in the movie, and Motörhead's ""Hellraiser"" is in the end credits. I think this sums up the movie!

69,emperor_bender,Pinhead...Freddy Krueger style!,9,20 February 2008,"A lot of people badmouth this movie because it was different than the first 2. I Think it was better actually. I liked Pinhead in this movie, he seemed more alive. Also, new characters, which was a very nice change of things from the first two. We have a new storyline here as well, which is very well done and I think it outdoes that of the first 2 movies. We also get a new set of Cenobites here. They are very interesting, and a nice change of pace from the same 3 cenobites in the first 2 movies. Except the one new cenobite in the 2nd movie (won't mention name to prevent the use of spoilers). Fans of the Nightmare series will love this, and die-hard Pinhead fans will love this as well. There's something for everyone. I give this 9/10.

70,Gafke,An Okay 3rd Installment,6,22 January 2006,"Where Hellraiser 1 and 2 were both very dark and very British, Hellraiser 3: Hell On Earth is very Hollywood.J. P. Monroe is the scumbag, soulless owner of The Boiler Room, a somewhat gothy dance club decorated with morbid art. In his search for more profane objects to add to his collection, J. P. comes across, and subsequently purchases, an odd pillar in an art gallery, which fans of the first two films will have no trouble recognizing. Enter Joey Summerskill, a frustrated reporter who comes across a bizarre death in a hospital emergency room. As she watches, a young man is torn to pieces by hooks and chains that appear out of midair. Eager to discover the story behind the gruesome, supernatural death, and with only one clue to follow, Joey arrives at the Boiler Room and befriends the insecure and abused Terri, J. P.'s ex girlfriend. Together, they discover the history of the Lament Configuration, the bizarre happenings at the Channard Institute and the story of Kirsty Cotton. But it doesn't end there. Joey begins having dreams about a man named Elliot Spencer, a World War One soldier who warns her that evil has been unleashed in the form of his own evil alter ego, the Cenobite Pinhead. Indeed, Pinhead soon breaks free and turns The Boiler Room into a slaughterhouse. Now he wants Joey. But can Elliot Spencer stop Pinhead before Joey is taken to Hell?This isn't a terrible sequel, really. It's not great, but it's nowhere near as bad as some of the others that followed. There's some nice bloody gore and naked girls, and Pinhead, as always, seems to be enjoying himself immensely, seducing his victims with a smile and making his offer of an eternity of pain seem quite irresistible. His scene with a priest is particularly nasty and blasphemous...and wickedly funny. The storyline doesn't always make sense, there's a lot of unintentionally laughable moments and some of the acting borders on the ridiculous, but all in all, Hellraiser 3 is pretty good cinematic junk food. If nothing else, Doug Bradley alone always makes these films watchable with his flawless portrayal of Pinhead.6 out of 10.",Hellraiser III - Hell on Earth
71,Bogey Man,Not bad at all!,7,3 June 2002,"Many consider that this third Hellraiser: Hell on Earth, directed by Anthony ""Waxwork"" Hickox is very bad and stupid, but I don't think so and I was pleasantly surprised when I viewed this. The story takes place this time in a big city in which the Pinhead and cenobites try to attack and bring Hell on Earth, thus the title. There is again a certain way to call Pinhead, and all the weak persons do so in order to get some satisfaction and pleasure...Instead, as we have learned in the previous films, they get something that PINHEAD considers pleasant and satisfying! Pain.There are many atmospheric scenes and one disco mayhem scene is memorable as Pin and pals attack and soon many kind of killing machines are invented and *small spoiler* cenobites destroy the whole place and people in it. Flying and slicing CDs are only among the many ""creative death tools"" found in this nice piece of horror trash. *no spoilers anymore!* The atmosphere is very dark in the streets throughout the film and I think this is as ""noteworthy"" as Hellraiser 2, as far as we talk about sequels. Part two has that problem that it relies too much on splatter effects and becomes pretty stupid and boring. This third installment is in my opinion far more interesting and also inventive, and I was pleasantly surprised having read all the bad comments from some people. This is not a horror masterpiece like Barker's first Hellraiser, but as a sequel and piece of 80's (often stupid) horror, this effort by Anthony Hickox is very well done and can be viewed several times without getting bored.7/10 but still, cannot be mentioned in the same sentence with the original Hellraiser.",Hellraiser III - Hell on Earth
72,krachtm,The beginning of the end.,4,24 April 2011,"There isn't really much to say about Hellraiser 3, because all Clive Barker fans are already familiar with this movie, and they all have strong opinions about it. I'm on the side of those who think that this movie single-handedly ruined the Hellraiser franchise, damning it to crappy, direct-to-video sequels. I'm not sure how one could mess up a Hellraiser movie so badly. Pinhead becomes a Freddy Krueger-inspired serial killer, spouting off one-liners and killing off young adults by the dozen. The Lament Configuration becomes Pinhead's sole weakness, rather than the vessel by which he is summoned. The cast is younger, prettier, and wears less clothes. The new Cenobites are a huge disappointment. What was once the stuff of nightmares becomes over-the-top and silly. In fact, the whole movie is campy, silly, and panders way too much to teenage audiences.The absolute worst part? I liked Anthony Hickox's Waxwork and Waxwork 2. How could he have made such a horrible mess of this movie? Hopefully, it was studio interference that ruined Hellraiser 3, but I guess everyone messes up sometimes.",Hellraiser III - Hell on Earth
73,fciocca,"Slightly better than the previous installment, tries to mix horror with typical Hollywood 90's action, and the result is weird",6,18 October 2020,"Hell on Earth mixes well conceived gore horror, which is very graphic and horrifying, with action sequences, especially towards the end. The result is very weird, I don't know really how to feel about it. The movie is more dynamic for sure, but at the same time, it loses a little bit the classic feel of the first two chapters. There is more CGI, and it does not look ridiculous as in Hellbound, in general VFX looks smoother and less invasive. However, practical effects are still the majority and as always they look amazing.The storyline is interesting and entertaining, it deeps the whole franchise universe, explaining new stuff and it connects perfectly to the previous chapter, as there will be a few references to Kirsty. I personally liked the characters too, found them better in every sense, really enjoyed Terry Farrell interpretation. Next to the main villain Pinhead, there will be also new Cenobites. Unfortunately, after a really good story development, the ending is just lame, there are a lot of explosions, which do not make any sense, and a very boring and unnecessary long final fight, won by the main protagonist, due to a stroke of luck happened in the right moment.The movie is kinda good, and if you are interested in the Hellraiser franchise is for sure worth a watch, there are all the elements for a decent horror gore production.",Hellraiser III - Hell on Earth

75,kingofdanerds,Another failed New York set horror film,4,3 May 2021,"1992 saw the release of another Hellraiser film for better or for worse. You see, this was the first of the Dimension Hellraiser films, that is the Dimension Film banner by Miramax due to the original studio or some stuff being bankrupt. Hellraiser III was originally going to continue the story of Kirsty and Julia but the actress who played Julia (Claire Higgins) did not want to do it. The film was directed by Anthony HIckox who directed the first two Waxwork films. The film sees Doug Bradley return as Pinhead (and will be in the role for quite some time) and Terry Farrell (Star Trek: Deep Space Nine). The film was a box office success but not really much of a critical success.After the events of Hellbound: Hellraiser II, Pinhead has split into two. The evil is Pinhead and the good is Elliot Spencer and Elliot Spencer wants the evil gone and so he enlists in the help of a TV news reporter before Pinhead unleashes Hell on Earth.Hellraiser III is one of those films that I liked when I first watched it and dislike it. First off, this film feels like the 90's Dimension Film. People who have watched the plethora of Dimension horror films will know what I mean. Hellraiser III lacks a lot of what made the first two films unique and appealing (that is if you like the style and tone of the first two films). Gone is the dark tone, the eroticism, the great special effects and the story is just strange. For newcomers to the Hellraiser series, you might like this film more than the vast majority. Why? Because Pinhead is officially a villain which was what everyone who has not seen the series before thinks of. But when watching the series all the way through, it is a head scratcher but yet here is why. Money and marketing. FIlm studios were like ""We have Jason and Freddy and they are slowly declining, let's make Pinhead the new big horror villain."" By doing so, you will get more money because that is what people want. They want an alternative to the declining horror stars. But here is another problem, trying to explain why Pinhead is the villain. This film does a poor job in trying to explain why Pinhead is the villain. Pinhead is the villain because the human part (the good) has separated from the evil. But they might as well have just had no explanation at all because the whole good and evil split deal is not very interesting at all and it is the big deal of the story. Which mostly sums up this film perfectly. Uninteresting. The acting is horrible. The characters are just as horrible. Our main character is a cliche riddled heroine. Why cliche? Oh, because they throw in small cliches like that she has been trying to stop smoking. Which in fact is only brought up for no reason once. Plus apparently her father died in Vietnam which could be interesting in concept but is not in execution. It adds nothing to the story. The one character interaction that is tolerable at the least is between our main named Joey Summerskill and this other lady named Terri. Perhaps it would have been nice to see some romance relation because the whole air is there and perhaps the whole eroticism of the first two films could have made a sort of appearance in this film. But no. It does not. The Cenobites is where I am most mixed about this film. Sure, Doug Bradley turns out a good performance as Pinhead and is effectively evil even if I do not wholly agree with it. The makeup on him looks cheap and just bleh. There are more Cenobites that come about in the film but none from the previous films. People call them lame but I think lamely unique is a better term. Lame because they are not creepy or disturbing and unique because, well, they just are. As for the special effects, they are just not very good. You would think with a bigger studio you would have better effects. But no. It trys to do more than what can actually be done. The kills are not really great. There is really only one kill that happens in the beginning of the film that I would consider good in terms of being just plain creepy and something that resembles the first two films. Another instance would be somewhere in the climax. Which brings up what I think of the climax. The subtitle of the film is Hell on Earth and the film does manage to deliver what the title says for better or for worse. (Note that if it is in the title, it technically is not a spoiler). It is out of place especially for a Hellraiser film, but it is fun to watch. Anything that I can find good in this film is the soundtrack which is fun by itself.Hellraiser III: Hell on Earth is a largely uninteresting film that takes away all of the fun and appeal of the first two films. This film might appeal to newcomers somewhat but for me who has seen the franchise, a big L.",Hellraiser III - Hell on Earth
76,Aussie Stud,"While not the best of the series, it was certainly hilarious!",7,24 June 2001,"The third installment in the Hellraiser series, we follow a female reporter, Joey, who stumbles upon the infamous 'Puzzlebox' and unleashes the terror within. The opening scenes of the movie are quite amusing. We see a screaming male wheeled into an operating room on a gurney. He has the infamous metal hooks and chains hanging from his shredded flesh and we can immediately identify this to the joyous work of Pinhead and his cenobites. As the doctors calm the screaming male, a sadistic nurse lays out weird-shaped and rather deadly looking implements on the table behind him. This really has nothing to do with the story, but it gives you the sense that these people aren't really Doctors and nurses. Before they can operate on the male, the chains spring to life and rip his body apart and we are introduced to the central character of this story.Joey is a struggling reporter who decides to cover this particular story. She talks to the victim's girlfriend, Terri, who explains that all of these things happened after he played around with a 'puzzlebox' that he stole from an antique collector. Terri gives the puzzlebox to a sleazy club owner who she once slept with and he unleashes Pinhead and his cenobites once again as he accidentally opens up the portal that connects Hell with Earth.The fun starts here once Pinhead gatecrashes a popular night club called ""The Boiler Room"". This is actually the highlight of the whole movie. As the patrons run towards the chained doors, each one is killed in a brutal yet hilarious fashion. One female patron has a spear of ice jutted into her open mouth. A male patron gets three snooker balls shoved down his mouth!! You basically see a lot of people getting hoisted into the air with chains and whatnot, but we get to see very elaborate killings. When some of the unfortunate victims return as cenobites, Joey discovers that she's stumbled upon more than just a ""hot scoop"". Actually, the cenobites in this movie are the most creative out of the whole series. Joey's cameraman gets turned into a cenobite and he has his camera installed into his head! A disc jockey has the unfortunate experience of having CD's implanted into his head and further uses them like Ninja stars as he hurls them as weapons! A bartender concocts molotov cocktails as he 'shakes but not stirs' his 'special' drink as he throws them at police officers who fire pointlessly at them with their guns.The most hilarious scene is when Terri (now a cenobite) walks around with a cigarette poking out of the flesh of her exposed throat and she burns Joey with it. But all good things must come to an end once Joey sends them back to where they came from. Not much insight is given to Joey's character - but the viewer hasn't really come along for the ride to learn about someone we don't really care about. We all came to see Pinhead and his cenobites, and that's what we got! The only one real surprise about this installment was catching Kirsty in a cameo as an asylum lunatic trying to convince everyone that she has been to Hell and back. It is quite obvious she was placed in this scene as a special treat for all the Hellraiser fans out there as this scene was completely irrelevant to the storyline.While not the most memorable of the Hellraiser series, it certainly provides enough laughs for an hour and a half of fun. It usually airs on the Sci-Fi Channel every few months. Keep your eyes out for it!6/10",Hellraiser III - Hell on Earth

Besides of the horrible and disgusting lead, the story was not good, the script didn't make much sense because of its countless plot holes, conveniences, and exceptions.

78,extravaluejotter,Pinewood to Hollywood - A Step Too Far,1,28 August 2006,"""Hellraiser III"" significantly ups the bar in production values compared to the 2 previous films. Actually filmed in America this time (the other 2 were shot in Britain although they were set in America), everything about ""Hellraiser III"" is bigger, grander and more spectacular than its predecessors.Apart from the story, that is. Although Clive Barker is an executive producer, his hand is noticeably absent from the screenplay. Bolted together by Peter Atkins and a hack who went on to work with the Power Rangers, the story loses a lot of its emotional appeal. The film focuses more on gore and spectacle than the original tale of obsession, love and loss, and is weaker as a result. Attempts are made to provide the heroine with an emotional back-story, but they descend into cliché by using that tired old ""I lost my father/brother/son/hamster in Vietnam"" plot device.I could tell that I wasn't engaging with the story when I noted the use of an old-fashioned wireless set as a way of initially communicating with the Pinhead Cenobite's original human persona. Captain Spencer is meant to have been a British army officer from WWI (1914-1918), but public radio broadcasting didn't start in Britain until 1922. Being able to nitpick like this when you've paid to watch something on the big screen is not the sign of a particularly good film.The idea of a Cenobite without any moral compass reduces Pinhead (A horror creation on a par with Dracula, in my opinion) to the same level as every other stereotypical celluloid purveyor of pointless cruelty and ultra-violence. Adding insult to injury, the closing credits are accompanied by some amorphous Goth-rock band belting out a track called ""Hellraiser"". How imaginative. All the ambiguity, magic and mystery of the original films has been well and truly bled out by ""Hellraiser III"". Avoid.",Hellraiser III - Hell on Earth
79,Vampenguin,Worst of the first three,4,15 April 2006,"Anthony Hickox's father, Douglas Hickox, directed one of my all-time favourite horror films, Theatre of Blood. When I saw the Hickox name appear in the opening credits, I thought maybe, just maybe, greatness could run in the family. Put simply: It doesn't. The two Hellraiser films up to this point were both very well done, different horror films. This, on the other hand, was likely made simply to cash in on Pinhead's icon status, and turn him in to another Freddy Krueger. Though it did start out pretty good, the more it told us the worse it got. The killing blow was when Capt. Spencer called Joey over to ""his world"". Made an already cheesy movie even worse, flashback and all. Shortly after that, they decide to break their own rules by killing a ton of innocent people. Make sense to you? Me neither. The new Cenobites were awful, especially the CD dude. They were definitely scraping the bottom of the barrel for that one. The film's two redeeming qualities were the incredible gore effects, and Doug Bradley. No matter how pointless and cheesy his character gets, this guy always puts on a good performance. As far as this series goes, stick with the first two.4.5/10",Hellraiser III - Hell on Earth
80,By-TorX-1,"Fun, but the Mystique and Menace of the Cenobites is Eroded",6,3 August 2020,"Hellraiser III: Hell on Earth is effectively Pinhead unchained in New York, and while there is gratification to be had in his torturous urban ways, the wonderful Sadean/Faustian mythos of the Cenobite lore is sadly undermined and diminished. Pinhead was always one of the most ambiguous of the movie monsters in that he effectively only gave the pleasure seekers who summoned him what they wanted (although they invariably did not read the small print on their contract), but in Hellraiser III he goes on an indiscriminate rampage. In this regard, it is not clear what Pinhead's goal is, does he intend to lash the whole world's population with hook-tipped chains? As such, the more intimate settings of the previous films give way to mass chain flayings and lots of explosions, flames, shattering windows and sparks a-flying in the NY streets. However, the biggest let down is the new generation of Cenobites, who lack the mystery and almost beautiful grotesqueness of the originals, and who incorporate (now dated) video and CD technologies, and even quip out one-liners. Indeed, is a Cenobite mixologist scary or just silly? As for the CD spinning Cenobite DJ, I suspect that he now feels as outmoded as the video cassette Transformers (and is mocked by cloud computing Cenobite). The film looks good, and Doug Bradley is as awesome as ever, but the intimacy of the original Hellraiser suits the character better. Thus, New York is best left to Jason Voorhees or the Cloverfield monster to menace, while Pinhead is far better delivering his unique brand of bodily pleasure to solo box puzzle solvers.",Hellraiser III - Hell on Earth

What he doesn't know is that the statue hides inside of itself all the evil's power, in the cruel creatures' form led by Pinhead. The imprudent guy ends up freeing the creatures. Third and weakest continuation of the 1987's success, ""Hellraiser"".Trying to accomplish a worthy and creative work as the two previous films, director Anthony Hickox increases a quick rhythm and blood to the show (in stylized scenes, replete of special effects), and he in fact gives anthological sequences as the massacre that takes place inside the club, but even so the result is mediocre, and Hickox isn't the main responsible: the fragility comes from a confused and uninteresting plot that ,instead of beginning from where ""Hellbound"" finished (a cold psychiatric hospital in London), starts in a hot Los Angeles.The whole cast's poor acting is other point that helped to turn ""Hellraiser 3"" into a collage of violent and nonsense scenes.The two first, ""Hellraiser"" and  ""Hellbound"",were filmed in England, and both had a memorable and exceptional cast (to begin with William Hope, who played Dr. Kyle Maclay in ""Hellbound"", and in special with Clare Higgins, who interpreted Júlia, the perverse stepmother.This magnificent actress's character was the main responsible for turning the Barker's stories into something even more special), a script with the Barker's ideas and basic concepts (the pain, the pleasure, the cruelty), an impressive and oppressive photography, a powerful sound track (courtesy of the great composer Christopher Young) and courageous directors who have experience enough to dare.And, when trying to recreate the way to tell a Barker's book, Anthony Hickox failed.

84,Clintekabor,Human dreams... such fertile ground for the seeds of torment,6,20 June 2020,"Hellraiser III Hell on Earth in my opinion is better than it's predecessor but still doesn't stack up to the heights of the first film.This film revolves heavily around Pinhead being spit into two personalities. His human self as captain Elliot Spencer and his cenobite manifestation of Pinhead.Pinhead is trapped with other cenobites and the essence of people from hell in a Pillar of Souls which manifested itself at the end of the previous film.The movie follows a young reporter Joey who has nightmares about the war and eventually is contacted in one of her dreams by Elliot Spencer. As the film progresses Joey meets a women named Terri who has come into possession of the Lament Configuration.The Pillar of souls is purchased and now owned by an egotistical club owner J.P Monroe. Who after making a deal with Pinhead starts feeding him souls from his club in exchange for all his desires.Eventually Monroe is fed to Pinhead by Terri which frees him from the pillar. Pinhead then resurrects his victims as new cenobites and begins to slaughter all the partygoers in Monroes nightclub.Joey escapes but is pursued by the cenobites through the streets and eventually gets trapped in a construction site. Joey solves the puzzle box known as the lament configuration sending the cenobites to hell. Pinhead meanwhile is confronted by his other half Elliot Spencer who fuses himself with pinhead before Joey kills pinhead and sends him back to hell.Joey buries the Lament Configuration at the construction site and we see many years into the future a buildings interior which looks like a identical replica of the box.My final word is that I have enjoyed the franchise as a whole to this point however It will only suit those who absolutely love the horror genre and away from the Hollywood budget and special effects. I think it has some twists and turns and I personally enjoyed it but it is different and only for those with a taste of blood, gore and human flesh.6.5/10",Hellraiser III - Hell on Earth
85,PlayerSS,"It's rare when I can say it, but this was abysmal.",2,2 June 2006,"I just went back and watched first two before this one. What was Doug Bradley thinking when he signed on to put Pinhead through this? There are quite a lot of things wrong with this movie.First off Pinhead is way to ""humanized"" in this one. He talks a lot which makes him more human and less demon from Hell. I also didn't like how it wasn't really Pinhead doing all the killings. It was just a shell of Spencer's former evil manifested on earth. I hated that. I couldn't believe it when it pointlessly started laughing during the club scene as well. Which brings me to my next points.The movie was way to urban to be a Hellraiser movie. I didn't like it that it took place in a club a lot and in the city. Plus Pinhead and the cenobites were exposed to way to many people. What ever happened to the only people seeing them was the people that figured out the box? That took away a lot of mystery of them.Next is all the pointless scenes of gore. I'm a big fan of gore, but the gore meant completely nothing in the movie as compared to the last ones. The club scene where Pinhead out of no where just kills a bunch of people is a shame.They tried so hard to make Pinhead the anti-hero villain like Jason or Freddy eventually became, but by this time nobody was asking him to be the anti-hero. This was only the third movie. I didn't feel for anybody in the movie and they tried desperately to make people care about Pinhead for some reason.Next up is the freakin cheesy new Cenobites. I'm sorry, but a fat bartender Cenobite isn't going to replace butterball Cenobite. WTF was up with the camera Cenobite and his one liners? I also had to chuckle at the CD Cenobite.The pay off to the Spencer/Pinhead separation was done decent, but Spencer and Pinhead being separated really wasn't needed in the first place. Oh well it's rule that classic horror series must be turned into jokes.In the end this movie was completely abysmal. Which there's not many movies that earn that title from me. Pinhead was elevated to the central character and humanized a lot, because of all the lines he had and his actions. The desperate attempt at making Pinhead the anti-hero villain didn't work for me.The pay off to the Spencer/Pinhead separation was done decent, but Spencer and Pinhead being separated really wasn't needed in the first place.

He becomes the central villain as he is let loose upon the city (along with the people he turns into inventively-designed Cenobites). However, a reporter (who witnessed someone being torn apart by chains and is determined to find out what happened) is guided by the ghost of Elliot Spencer, Pinhead's former self who has been released from his demonic side.All in all, this is an inventive and well-made sequel, probably one of the best of the Hellraiser series.",Hellraiser III - Hell on Earth
87,badfeelinganger,"Peter Atkins script, Anthony Hickox's film is a worthy successor to Clive Barker's flesh-ripping original. A good horror sequel , this is adult horror to die for.",10,18 September 2014,"Hellraiser III gives the series a much needed jump-start, following a great and classic original, and a strong first sequel. Unfortunately, the 'Female Cenobite' (mysteriously left unnamed), 'Chatterer,' and 'Butterball' are gone, but a series of about half a dozen new Cenobites keeps the hellish imagery alive. I think that one of the better elements of this instalment in the series is that they show all of the new Cenobites being created. In the anti-religious tradition of the Hellraiser series, some of Pinhead's antics in the church near the end of the film are great. When the priest holds up the cross to him, Pinhead melts it in his hand, and at the same time he utters an absolutely brilliant bit of dialogue, 'Thou shalt not bow down to any graven image.'After that, Pinhead's self-crucifixion scene was wonderfully sickening, yet his intentions in doing that were both clearly presented and morbidly farcical. Jesus was crucified, paying for man's sins, thereby saving mankind from damnation and becoming the subject of countless masses of people's unquestioning adoration, inspiring Pinhead to crucify himself and state that 'I am the way.' Therefor the underlining meaning is that Pinhead will sacrifice himself, paying for man to 'live' in sin. Utterly brilliant! Besides all that, I think that this instalment had some of the best death scenes of the series so far, particularly in the nightclub. Some of that was almost physically painful to watch, a sure sign of success for a horror film. Not only was that Boiler Room massacre convincingly portrayed, but writer Peter Atkins also had the excellent idea to have poor Terri walk through the masses of mutilated bodies after the massacre had ended. Pretty uplifting stuff, huh? A little too gory and bloody? Don't moan about that, it's not supposed to be good, clean, fun. This is a horror film, and by definition, horror films are supposed to be horrible. Hellraiser III achieves this horror better than either of the two that preceded it, finally leaving the viewer satisfied. With its bravura camera-work, fetishistic Cenobite designs, nerve-jangling soundtrack, and literate Peter Atkins script, Anthony Hickox's film is a worthy successor to Clive Barker's flesh-ripping original.Freed from the stone prison of the Pillar of Souls, Pinhead quickly dispatches decadent rock club owner JP Monroe. Hearing of JP's gruesome death, TV reporter Joey Summerskill sniffs a scoop, but what she finds is something more nightmarish: Pinhead and his new purveyors of pain, Camerahead, CD and Barbie.",Hellraiser III - Hell on Earth

However this one isn't great. The plot was good and if executed well I think this could have been a good movie, however some of the scenes in this movie were sloppy and wrong. I liked the idea of the soldier who became Pinhead finding Joey and telling him to lead Pinhead to him were he has power, but again this was a scene that I found kind of messed up and not living up to it's potential. Not really recommended but watch if you want to complete the trilogy because the sequels that follow this one are a waste of time and cheap sin offs.*/***** Very poor.",Hellraiser III - Hell on Earth

90,lonchaney20,"It sounds okay on paper, but director Hickox unintentionally turns it into a hilariously overwrought parody.",5,25 March 2017,"Of all the horror franchises to devolve into mindless slasher nonsense, I find the Hellraiser series to be the most depressing. Whereas there's only so much you can do with the simple set-ups of films like Halloween and Friday the 13th, there was something edgy and elegant about the first two Hellraiser films. While they were certainly as gory and titillating as their slasher counterparts, they had a little more going on under the surface, and were just as interested in their characters as they were in their violent set-pieces. This is mostly due to Clive Barker, the writer and director of the first Hellraiser, whose poetic and shocking horror novels remain benchmarks in the genre. Even starting from Hellraiser II, however, certain slasher tropes were starting to creep in, such as corny one-liners and gratuitous death scenes. Even so, they both never forgot their primary aim, which was to present a seriously disturbing horror film geared towards adults; even Hellraiser II doesn't showcase its few one-liners with winking irony. Starting with Hellraiser III, though, several things went horribly wrong: the studio began to meddle, Clive Barker found himself increasingly unwelcome as a creative consultant, the budgets grew smaller, and Pinhead became the primary antagonist of a series which increasingly lost its footing. It's difficult to say exactly where it all went wrong, but somehow the stars aligned to make a Hellraiser III so ludicrous that it seems to come from an entirely different planet than the first two.This entry, scripted by Barker's long-time friend Pete Atkins (also the screenwriter of Part II), finds Pinhead (again played by the brilliant Doug Bradley), still trapped in the Pillar of Souls after his battle with Dr. Channard. The Pillar is purchased by the gloriously reprehensible douche bag/club owner J.P. Monroe (Kevin Bernhardt), who soon discovers that he can free Pinhead by feeding him souls. Meanwhile reporter Joey Summerskill (Terry Farrell) stumbles onto the story of a lifetime when she witnesses a man torn apart in the E.R. by the power of the Lament Configuration (i.e. the box used to summon the Cenobites). Her investigation leads her to J.P.'s ex-girlfriend Terri (Paula Marshall), and the two try to figure out exactly what the hell is going on.It sounds okay on paper, but Hickox unintentionally turns it into a hilariously overwrought parody. Given Hickox's previous horror comedies such as Waxwork and Sundown: The Vampire in Retreat, I assumed this might be the intention, but Hickox insisted in interviews that he was attempting to make a serious psychological horror film in the vein of Jacob's Ladder or Angel Heart. Instead he directs his cast to deliver corny, unmistakably nineties dialogue in an alternately stilted or over-the-top fashion. Only Doug Bradley really escapes with his dignity intact (the man can make even the lousiest dialogue sound like Shakespeare), but I must admit I enjoyed Bernhardt's absurdly sleazy turn as J.P. He looks like the sleazy American cousin of Rupert Everett, and I love how transparent his attempts to sweet talk women into his bed/into Pinhead's stomach(?) are. Only those two really help to sell the ridiculous goings on. Our two female leads are likable enough, but they're not nearly as convincing as Ashley Laurence is in the previous films, though it doesn't help that they're confronted by the most ridiculous Cenobites in the whole series. After the film's most ambitious set-piece (a massacre in a crowded nightclub), Pinhead mounts his attack on humanity with the following soldiers of Hell: there's Camera-Head, whose head has been fused with his news camera, and who spouts one-liners like ""That's a wrap!"" and ""Are you ready for your close-up?""; CD-Head, a DJ whose head is pierced with CDs and whothrows CDs at people; and the Barbie Cenobite, a bartender whose head is wrapped in barbed wire, and who uses a cocktail mixer filled with gasoline to wreak havoc on some cops. It's jaw-droppingly stupid, and completely undermines the pain/pleasure dynamic of the first two entries. If Hickox was aiming to emulate Alan Parker or Adrian Lyne, he's way off the mark - instead think Sam Raimi, if Sam Raimi was a moron.To be fair, though, the movie looks very good, apart from the corny, early-nineties CGI, and some decent dialogue actually trickles through now and then. I particularly enjoyed several of Pinhead's lines, such as ""Down the dark decades of your pain, this will seem like a memory of Heaven,"" and ""I will enjoy making you bleed, and I will enjoy making you enjoy it,"" which briefly touches on Clive Barker's original intentions for the character. Unfortunately this film, by turning Pinhead into a Freddy Krueger-esque slasher front-man, set the series on the wrong path for good. Atkins and director Kevin Yagher attempted to put things right with the ambitious Hellraiser IV: Bloodline, but studio meddling would turn a potential masterpiece into a complete disaster.",Hellraiser III - Hell on Earth
91,videodrome1234,Just a slasher,5,23 August 2014,"If the franchise would have ended with the 2nd part, then there already would have been too many films, but the 3rd part is even more out there. Barker must have thought that too, 'cause after Anthony Hickox's 3rd part Barker jumped ship and back away from the whole thing (even if he was only just the executive producer on this one already) So he didn't have much to do with the story and he didn't hide that fact or the fact that he wasn't too pleased with the sequels. Hellraiser III made the biggest mistake it could make. It lowered Pinhead to the level of all the other baddies, he only differed from any other typical killer by looking better and having a few good one liners. So they successfully made a slasher movie out of the series. Pinhead is stuck in a block after the Big Confrontation in ""Hellbound,"" The block containing Pinhead and the puzzle cube is bought by a young playboy as an art piece. Pinhead busies himself escaping by getting the playboy to lure victims to his presence so he can use their blood. Once free, he seeks to destroy the puzzle cube so he need never return to Hell, but a female reporter is investigating the grisly murders thus standing in his way. After the pointlessly dragged out beginning (you have to wait till almost half the film for Pinhead to escape) he is ridiculously quiet and spends the rest of the film running from the other Cenobits with the cube in his hand. Barker's pain and pleasure theme is gone, in its place we get the very original ""we have to stop the bad guy before he releases chaos onto the world"" theme. After the first film that's totally of logic. The makers must have wanted us to just forget that he was neither evil nor the bringer of chaos before. So this part brings to fruition what Hellbound started: in other words stripping it of meaning. Then with no original concept it just adds itself to all the other stupid, pointless horror sequels. This also meant that the terrifying Pinhead becomes someone who chases a woman how? by walking menacingly slowly behind her! He becomes a supernatural baddie in a slasher movie, who kills without discretion or reason anyone who gets close just not the one he should be killing. And the Cenobits who are made from his victims are just plain lame. The killings at the disco that were promising in the beginning of the scene quickly turns to something with which it's easy to see that the whole film should have landed in the garbage. In the bloodcurdling calm Pinheads place we got a hysterically laughing, over emoting Freddy clone. In place of the weighty, brutal atmosphere we got a silly, cartoon parody of itself kills just to shock viewers. So even the gore doesn't end up meaning too much. All in all the only thing positive that can be said about Hell on Earth is Pinhead's awesome church scene. And its true, if you forget there was a first part, that it's a perfect slasher film. 5/10 https://www.youtube.com/user/Videodromeblog",Hellraiser III - Hell on Earth

96,blubb06,Pinhead: The Hannibal Lecter of B-Movies,6,6 August 2007,"At the end of ""Hellbound: Hellraiser II"", we were introduced to the human side of Pinhead, the iconic face, voice and hook thrower of the series. The sequel elaborates on this  he has indeed split into two characters, the cenobite and his former self, both more alive than ever.I read in an interview that actor Doug Bradley got offers from female fans to father their children. There's a sex appeal to the character very like Hannibal's, and it must be in Bradley's facial expression or the fact his make-up doesn't really disfigure him (Unluckily for us, the sexual angle in Clive Barler's Book ""The Hellbound Heart"" is never explored). Bradley personally thinks it's the way he's filmed in that gorgeous costume. It adorns a plain-looking guy and turns him into the androgynous drag queen from hell.With 15 years distance and the higher resolution of DVD, a lot of the effects and make-up in this enjoyable shocker look ridiculous, which is half-way compensated by the good acting of the main cast. It has a straight-forward story (Pinhead taking over the real world) and some memorable scenes, particularly when he mocks the Christian last supper. It introduces female heroine and news-hound Joey whose dreams of saving her father (Daddy is back  again!) from death in Vietnam lead her to Pinhead's human self, a disillusioned officer in the trenches of the First World War. Joey is partly accompanied by the tramp girl Terri, a lost soul who can't dream or separate good from bad friends. She's an ex-girlfriend of J.P. Monroe, the sadistic grown-up rich kid who lets Pinhead loose upon the real world. They are all flawed, yet somehow sympathetic. The supporting cast ultimately end up in the meat grinder as usual, but Pinhead has to coerce and seduce rather than threaten this time. He has to use all his remaining brain cells  at least in the first half, which leads to his most intelligent lines in the whole series  maybe. I can't tell, because this was the last one I watched.Of the first three, it's the most fun and the most spectacular in terms of explosions and massacre, though not the most shocking  the crown of skin-crawlers goes to its prequels, and among those narrowly to ""Hellbound: Hellraiser II"". Pinhead gets to play his favorite game with a club full of people, some of whom can't act even for their lives, but must have had a great time. The weird ""Boiler Room"" club setting and constant Heavy Metal music remind me of the Rammstein video ""Angel"" (Engel). The lighting unfortunately doesn't work very well for Pinhead at DVD resolution, but the set is spectacular. Bradley's performance as his human side relies too much on screen presence  there's almost no acting to speak of in his scenes with Joey as they wander among the mutilated dead of his past. Just like in the unmasking in ""Hellraiser II"", he remains completely characterless  a cartoon. Maybe that's deliberate to keep him usable in the future, but also a bit disappointing. World War One was disillusioning for many people  one of them created the ""Lord of the Rings"".An enjoyable waste of time, and also a cult classic.",Hellraiser III - Hell on Earth

Also looks like the movie makers wanted to make Pinhead more like an iconic super-villain like Jason and Freddy. Hellraiser 3 can't be looked at with serious eyes, because it's so campy and ridicules, it's a very typical for late 80s and 90s horror films where the movie makers just wanted to make them light and cartoonish.

98,saxon-7,Pinhead Released,7,25 February 2006,"Pinhead Released on Earth is basically the story of this addition the Hellraiser franchise and while it's not as good as the first it's better than the second, if a bit poorly made (some of the Cenobites are a bit laughable). The story while good isn't that well executed by Anthony Hickox, but it's fun to see what Cenobites Pinheads creates, while these new Cenobites aren't as scary or should we say serious than the ones in the first two, they sure are a comic bunch. The way that Pinhead is brought back from his demise is a bit so-so (come on he can't really be killed anyway.), it's still keeping with the character's background.The acting in this one is, apart from Doug Bradley; who ones again outperforms his co-actors as Pinhead/Elliott Spencer, is very lacking. Terry Farrell is so over the top in her acting of Joanne Summerskill; an journalist that comes across a video recording of Kristy, that it's more of a joke than anything else, granted she some shinning moments but they are few and far between. Paula Marshall does an okay job as Terri; a lost teenager that has no place to go but of cause knows where Pinhead's monolith is, but the character dosn't have that much dept. >Spoiler< The Cenobite made out of her is almost as laughable as the one made from her former boyfriend. Ashley Laurence's role is so small that it's can't be judged, but nice to see her in this as it keeps this installment in line with the franchise.I give this 7 out of 10, mostly due to the fact that the effects are better than in Hellbound.

100,Django-21,Average sequel with some flair left,7,10 March 2001,"This is an ok and entertaining movie.  Still I would have preferred another Kirsty adventure to explore the various concepts and ideas of Hellraiser 2 in more detail. The original two Hellraiser movies had more creative input from Clive Barker and also had a more British gothic feel.  This americanised approach to sequelitis gives us the usual yawn inducing jokes, lots of explosions and special effects overdrive that made the horror sequel (and most of the originals) so archaic and at times plain embarrasing in the late eighties and early nineties. However Hellraiser 3 still has a lot more to offer viewers looking for something darker or more thought provoking tan the average stalk 'n' slash sequel.  The nightclub owner, JP Monroe (character name) is a selfish hedonistic male slut who has sex with women and then doesn't want to know them.  But he is shocked initially, when he sees the fate of his latest conquest at the hands of Pinhead (still in statue form from the end of Hellraiser 2).  Thismakes his agreeing to procure more victims for Pinhead even more evil and it's good to see some sort of layering of evil at work.  Deep Space Nine's Terry Farrel is hardly in the Heather Langenkamp or Ashley Laurence school of intelligent and resourceful heroines but she is more than a few steps up from the Denise Richards school of bimbos. Character Terri (Paula Marshall) is pretty pathetic at times, but as she's probably been under the influence of creeps like JP Monroe her whole life, it is possible to sympathise to an extent and there is a nice twist to her victim role, when it's her time to feed Pinhead. Once Pinhead is freed from the statue there is some fun to be had with the nightclub massacre, the creation of new cenobites and the pursuit of Joey (Terry Farrel) who has what Pinhead needs but can't just take. The original Hellraiser score is as effective as ever and helps inject some mood into the early parts of the film and it also subtly foretells Terri's expected demise. Ultimately however, Pinhead has been reduced to camp bogeyman and to some extent it is your usual Hollywood gore sequel, but there is enough of a sombre tone carried over from the earlier Hellraiser movies to raise it above some of the garbage that horror fans were being fed at the time.  And at least it does develop (if not totally satisfactorily) the human origin of Pinhead from the previous sequel.  I'd say 3 out of 5.",Hellraiser III - Hell on Earth

He's just shown killing more than when we just saw him kill one victim. He still has smart things to say. And he still has all 128 pins embedded in his head.The new Cenobites were interesting, but they weren't as creepy as the Chatterer, Female, or Butterball. The only two real intriguing Cenobites were the CD Cenobite and the Terri Cenobite.The cast was good. We got to see Doug Bradley as Human and Pinhead. Terry Farrell, long before her role on Star Trek: Deep Space Nine, is intriguing to watch as the young reporter who is given the task to stop Pinhead, as well as Paula Marshall and Kevin Bernhardt, who play an ally and foe to the reporter that become Cenobites in the end (I wonder if those were really the actors under all that makeup and leather).And a big plus is that they use the original score instead of cooking up some cheesy score as most third sequels do.

I know a lot of people love it, but I just thought it was atrociously bad.
First off we have Pinhead, whom the producers wanted to be more like wise-cracking Freddy Krueger. This does not fit the character at all. Sure, his monologues are catchy and some scenes are... interesting - because of Doug Bradley's superb performance - BUT this is not Pinhead.
The effects are cheap and terrible (the exploding head at the beginning eg does not look real at all). The new cenobites look laughable and pathetic rather than shocking and gruesome.I spent more time laughing AT this movie then anything else.
The movie focuses more on non-bloody special effects with multiple explosions, the ""Boiler Room Massacre"" is laughable at best. This is not at all what a Hellraiser massacre should look like.

My criteria for a bad horror film: 1) the acting doesn't have to be great, but at least as good as a high school drama student; 2) special effects don't have to look that real, but at least show that someone tried to make it look realistic (show a little effort);  3) it should have a somewhat coherent plot; and (applying only to sequels) 4) let it follow the other movies logically, use a little continuity, and resolve what was left unresolved in the previous film(s).  That said, this film isn't even 'so-bad-it's-good' it's just bad.  Terrible acting, terrible story, but slightly follows previous movies in the series via references to Kirsty Cotton, from the first two films.  But even the reference is, at best, weak and only serves as a way to connect the film to the others (which is okay, but amounts to-- and resolves nothing).  The new cenobites are pretty stupid too.  This movie tries to be things it cannot be: it tries to be a good story, but it's not; it tries to add a little comedy, but nothing's funny; it tries to be scary, but if there was any horror in this movie it's the fact that it was made at all.  But it is gory, but not like the previous movies.  Pinhead is more menacing when he's in an atmosphere that's not quite British and not quite American.  He's scarier in an attic or in the walls of a mental hospital than a New York nightclub or in the streets of Manhattan.  This film sort of suffers from the 'Friday the 13th Syndrome'--""let's put Pinhead in New York and see what happens"".  What's next, Pinhead in space?",Hellraiser III - Hell on Earth

111,tonyband,Hell On Earth is not the movie many Hellraiser fans portray it to be. Pinhead brings Hell On Earth To New York,9,2 February 2016,"Vilified by many as the beginning of the end as far as the Hellraiser series is concerned, Hellraiser III: Hell On Earth is anything but.This film is what Hellbound: Hellraiser II is to the original, a progression, a sense of a series in evolution. It continues what Hellbound began and doesn't hold back for one second. After Hellraiser we screamed for more Pinhead and his Cenobite army, and after Hellbound we again wanted more Pinhead and his return to the sequel; now Hell On Earth brings Pinhead back as well as increasing his much wanted screen time in a film which has more action than an Arnie/stallone movie! This is essentially what this movie boils down to, and why I like it so much, the action it has. From the increased chaos on the streets of New York to the complete carnage in a seedy Night Club, this installment has it. It has the quality that so many horror fans long for in their favourite horror movies, which most of the time they lack; action and a distinct amount of pace to go with it.Hellbound had its share of high-intensity scenes, however this film also has them and despite Hellbound and Hell On Earth not being a shade on ""Hellraiser"" in terms of imagery, visual impact, story and raw quality, Hell On Earth is a decent movie, which holds it's own as far as entertainment value is concerned. Like in its predecessor, Hell On Earth again takes Pinhead's character to new levels and we learn more still about what he is and who he used to be. Elliot Spencer, Pinhead's past self, actually comes into the story in a big way, giving us a most interesting film packed full of hair raising events and unusual but intriguing Cenobites to watch.Hell On Earth is not the movie many Hellraiser fans portray it to be. It is instead another positive accomplishment as far as a good sequel is concerned, so again I highly recommend.",Hellraiser III - Hell on Earth
112,gomi28,Money: the root of all evil,2,30 June 2002,"Although the first 2 were under budget and the SFX were very bad, they followed the original story.  Hellraiser and Hellbound were not about nail-biting edge of your seat gags and one-liners, it was about presenting a concept most people are exposed to but do not think of.  We are taught that Heaven is where we all want to go to, and Hell is bad, but what if it were switched and hell is what we strived for.  Barker was trying to make a twist on Puritian belifes as he feels trapped or banished from ""regular"" society as can also be seen in ""Nightbreed"".  In Hellraiser, only those that make an attempt will be blessed with ""an experience beyond limits... pain and pleasure, indivisible.""  It isn't about mass distruction and death, it is about people comming to terms with what awaits us after this world.Even on a tight budget the ""real"" hellraisers were successful, so a big company, Paramount, thought ""Why can't we make $$ off of this thing"".  So this 3rd attempt had a larger budget and threw a bunch of special effects in, found some witty one-line writers, used Doug Bradley and the box, but never bothered to read anything Clive Barker did.  Just because Doug Bradley is Pinhead doesn't mean they know what they are doing.  They took a good story and made it into a generic slasher movie.  The cenobites didn't even have the corpse like blue skin signifying lack of blood.It started out OK, but in the middle they made some idiotic decisions: Random people become cenobites (you have to strive to become a cenobite, Frank and Julia never were), these cenobites have CDs and cameras in their heads??!?! WHAT THE HELL??!?!If you like ""Nightmare on Elm Street"" and have no clue what the real Hellraiser stories (as in before the movies were even thought of, like in the comic books) this might be good for you, as it wasn't lacking in Hollywood fluff, but for anyone that knows who Grizlard was, this was a disapointing derailment of a good concept.",Hellraiser III - Hell on Earth

Even a smoker cenobite and a metal pipe in his head cenobite. The camera-man cenobite even said hilarious things after killing people like: ""That's a wrap"" and ""Ready for your close up"". Even Pinhead started to use muscle power and yelled and growled like a dog. They killed Pinhead to say it in other words. And one scene you could se Jim Carrey appear in a coffee cup! It looked just like him! Surely it wasn't him, but... Jeez! I'm giving this movie 5 for two reasons: awesome killings and scenes that made me cry of laughter. Seriously, I cried!

Hellraiser 2 was also a fantastic film. it was one of the very few sequels that are actually as good or better than the original. (this and wayne's world 2). Hellraiser 3... well,it was pretty good. the big problem here was that rather than making him the emotionless figure of pure evil like the first two he was turned into just another bad guy in another horror movie. basically hell on earth was campier, bloodier, trashier, and much more mindless than it's predeccesors. back when it came out it seemed like an abomination, now, when compared to current horror (if you can even call them that) movies it looks like a masterpiece. so overall i thought it was a decent movie, just don't compare it to the first and second.",Hellraiser III - Hell on Earth
116,EtherealMind,Why do people rate the Hellrasier movies so highly?,3,22 June 2011,"I've never understood why these Hellrasier movies get so much accolades in the horror genre. Hellrasier is often called a ""horror classic"". I've never understood why. Putting Hellrasier in the same category as the Exorcist or Halloween is just laughable in my opinion.This third instalment has plenty of gore and gruesome death scenes but suffers from the same problems I've always had with the other Hellrasier movies - the acting is just terrible, the dialogue is inane and the direction is amateurish and extremely dull. There is literally no attempt made to make any of the scenes suspenseful and intelligent. Everything is just thrown in your face and made obvious. Aside from the gore, Hellrasier has nothing going for it. I wish there was something positive I could say about it but I really can't. The only positive I can draw from this is it has some interesting death scenes. That's it.The Cenobites in the other Hellrasier movies were actually pretty cool, in this movie though, the Cenobites just look ridiculous and silly. (You'll see what I mean when you watch it). There's also too many Cenobites on screen at once - Why couldn't the director just stick with the original four Cenobites we were already familiar with? Was it really necessary to have 5-6 Cenobites on screen at once?""Pinhead"" was also extremely annoying in this film; with his pretentious one liners and obvious attempts to try and come across as evil and spooky. (Cackling like a maniac etc..). If you want to watch a movie with people getting killed brutally for no apparent reason, then you'll probably enjoy this film. But if you're looking for an intelligent, well directed horror movie I'd strongly recommend you watch something else. This film isn't for you.",Hellraiser III - Hell on Earth
117,umyde,American horror (horrible) franchising,4,20 October 2002,"I guess fans of this type of movies will always give a dime for their icons, may they be Jason, Freddy, Candyman or whoever else. These icons are the offspring of a tradition that started with the late 50's b-series and spawned into the 70's gore. There is a slight difference, however: no real commercial sense was implied in the making of these movies. In the case of the HELLRAISER series (as well as NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET, FRIDAY THE 13TH, etc.), a bright idea, instead of being explored, gets exploited. Nothing left but to be startled at the stupidity of it all. Although I wouldn't go as far as to consider myself a fan of the series, the original HELLRAISER was the first cinema fright I remember as a child. Also being a fan of gore, trash and underground cinema, I cannot consider HELL ON EARTH anything but a laugh of a movie.

119,Angelosilence,No Justice in Hell,3,13 July 2003,"Hellraiser III is a big departure from the previous two films (although it was written be Pete Atkins, who wrote Hellbound).  The beginning of the film presents us with lighting and locales that just seemed too representative of the early nineties time period. 	A lot of the film doesn't make sense for the first hour, which is punctuated by dreams, and a few killings which just chalk it up to `slasher' status.  Events are too formulatic, which cheats us out the novelty of Hellraiser I and II. 	Things start to make sense after about fourty-five minutes, when we learn that Pin-head's human form has been split from his Cenobite persona, which has taken refuse in a statue, that talks to its owner. 	The dialogue from Pin-head is a lot less all-knowing resident of Hell, and a lot more devil-on-your-left-shoulder.  But at least his vocabulary stays intact.  This doesn't save him from being degraded down to Freddy-status as just another evil voice in the shadows. 	After being released from the statue, Pin-head goes out on a rampage, and making himself so damn public.  Because everyone has seen him (not to mention an earlier hospital scene), the movie seems a lot less personal, and looses traction for it.  The up side of this sequence is the end where you watch a closed door seep out blood with hook noises coming from inside for a length of time that just makes one feel slightly uncomfortable. 	In the final moments, Pin-head creates his own Cenobites, which lessens their mystique.  The last four were truely creatures of hell, but these guys just look like a make-up designer's wet dream. 	All in all I thought it made a good horror film, but its desire to stay with a more conventional formula makes it a bad choice to carry the title Hellraiser.",Hellraiser III - Hell on Earth
120,soldier-81367,"A piece of art, it's quite exquisite, relax baby it's better than sex",10,30 May 2017,"""Hellraiser III: Hell On Earth"" came out four years after ""Hellraiser II: Hellbound"" which is a bit strange considering that ""Hellraiser 2"" came out a year after the original was released. As a viewer, I'd be more skeptical of ""Hellbound"" when it came out considering the quick turn around, but with a four year gap between films, surely they've used that time wisely to craft a great story and film right? ""Hell on Earth"" picks up sometime after the events of the second film, when we are introduced to a young, swaggering asshole named J.P Monroe who purchases the ""Pillar of Souls"" that was briefly shown at the end of ""Hellbound"" from a random homeless man in an art gallery. Pinhead and the box are trapped within the pillar, and while as a piece of art, it's quite exquisite, it's not exactly something you'd really want in your living room.thanks to special effects by Bob Keen, who did everything from EVENT HORIZON to THE NEVERENDING STORY. For example, when Pinhead finally -- and expectedly -- becomes free to make people suffer horribly at J.P.'s club The Boiler Room, he slaughters the entire club, laughing himself silly while doing so. (At least the guy enjoys his work.) The effects here are excellent.Terry Farrell really shines as Joey. The role is a pretty standard nosey reporter just looking for that big scoop but for whom nothing ever works out. As clichéd as the character's setup is, somehow Farrell makes it work. She sounds sincere and thoroughly innocent, which obviously works nicely to contrast the pure evil.What really makes HELLRAISER III stand out is the sheer messed up nature of it all. The violence. The gore. The anarchy of death left in Pinhead's wake. That's shown in graphic detail when one of J.P's bimbos get her skin ripped off like a piece of meat. The music by Motörhead's ""Hellraiser,"" written by rock gods Lemmy, Ozzy, and Zakk Wylde. That alone makes it all worthwhile.0",Hellraiser III - Hell on Earth
121,kroko007,another perfect sequel,10,17 May 2006,"Ah, 'Hell on Earth' another gem, solely for having Doug on screen more than most. But it was enjoyable for other reasons, too. I never even noticed that Pete Atkins snuck in there as the bartender who becomes Barbie the Cenobite! And of course the back-story on Elliott was a treat.Everyone really did a fantastic job in this one, too, with playing their characters to the hilt. Even the little ditzy blonde that J.P. lures to bed only to end up a McCenobite snack. Yeah, she was a talking stereotype, but she was 100% into it. She is also a study in how clueless women often act, sad to say. They believe what they want to, ignoring the facts of life and getting hurt  or in this case munched down without sauce. Another little bit of psychology tossed in, and I love it every time they do it. In that scene, there is a quote that I rarely hear cited in any 'favorite quotes' thread, but it's a great one: ""Their wealth was so tempting, their affection so conditional, what could you do?"" Dr. Pinhead is in. Face it, he'd make a great therapist, even if the couch might have nails sticking out of it. Of course my personal favorite quote is also in this scene: ""Flesh. Power. Dominion."" But I'm not going to explain why. =) It was great to read that Doug had gotten to play with the make-up for the second crew's director, applying the wound effects on the guy that Camerahead stabs his lens through. Doug tells us in his book that he was just standing around on set when the crew turned out to be short-handed and he stepped up to help. Now whenever I watch that scene I think, ""There's Doug's handiwork!"" The main thing that bugged me about this film was Joey falling for Pinhead's trick of showing up as her father. Not a problem with the movie, it's just one of those 'scream at the screen' moments. How can she be so stupid? But hey, that's our clueless women believing what they want to phenomenon kicking in again! (Not to pick on women - men do it, too). ;) And I know he doesn't believe it, but the bit where Doug says the word 'unstoppable'? It's not messed up.

You will notice that first a central button is pushed. This face represents the ""witchcraft secret"" revealed especially on pages 170 and 171 of ""The Adventure of Self Discovery"" by Dr. Stanislav Grof and available from www.heliotrope.com .""Pain and pleasure indivisible"", it replaced LSD. ""You cannot enter the Underworld without the golden bough ( Vogel stimulation with the Vegas nerve)"", but, ""The road to Averness is easy"", Virgil, in his ""Aenied"". William Morgan was killed for revealing this secret. Second, two things spread and a finger is stuck in the gap. This represents the ""alchemy secret"" revealed in the earliest posts of Dr. Lahunkun in groups.yahoo.com/group/alchemy61/ . There you will learn how to make an opposite polarity cancellation reactor, which the ancients called a ""shekina"". Dr. Wilhelm Reich was killed for revealing this secret. And, third, the circle was traced all the way around by a finger. This represents the ""sorcery secret"", that there are other probability time lines that can be contacted, visited and used by taking advantage of the fact that the polarity cancellation equals the natural logarithm of the probability relationship. Did you ever notice that TV and movies about time travel always propagated that if you, messed with the past it could be disastrous for the world. First of all, you can't go back on your exact time line, like to meet your actual past self, for, the quantum probability wave crests prevent this by clashing. This is solid quantum mechanics. The propaganda that time was only one line for everybody was a lie, and it's denial a secret. But, we complained enough that Scientific American, in it's May 2003 article ""The Multiverse"" confessed that there are multiple time lines; and, the ""mutiverse"" is so infinite, for example, there has to be a real Pinhead somewhere, sometime, on some probability time line, in a ""multiverse' that has everything. And, each probability is repeated infinitely. Sorcery is probability manipulation. For example, rituals by manipulating probability distributions change time lines. Rituals are not ""witchcraft"". There is no real witchcraft without Vogel stimulation. ""If with but the faith of a mustard seed you say to this mountain move it shall be moved."" I knew a girl who bragged about the incredible bad luck she had. The more people who believed her the worse her luck became. It pays to control our speech. Rituals are sorcery. Dr. Franz Ludwig Boltzman was killed for revealing this secret, and THEY put S = k Lyn W on his gravestone. In ""Hellraiser II"", ""Hellbound"", we saw that Hell is structured in stone. Who builds in stone? What is a builder in stone called? THEY consider these secrets to be THEIR exclusive privileged property. THEY dare claim a monopoly on Hell!

125,deathadder-13878,The nineties: when horror died.,3,24 November 2016,"Hellraiser 3 is one of those lame attempts at continuing a horror franchise that audiences were subjected to in the 90's. Child's play, Friday the 13th, Halloween, etc. These movies just got silly and poorly produced by the early 90's.As for the movie at hand, it's almost totally lacking in the relatively sophisticated mood and creativity of Hellraiser (1987) and Hellbound: Hellraiser 2 (1988). These were movies about the dark aspects of the human condition, about authentic human beings falling prey to lust and temptation. Their misadventures opened the door to the Cenobites, those sinister BDSM icons. Besides punishing sinners, the more innocent also would end up drawn into the mess.In the 3rd film, we instead get unpleasant and shallow characters that we just don't care about. The compelling thing about the earlier movies was how seemingly ordinary and unpretentious people were seduced by their base impulses. We didn't hate or ridicule these people. The guy who brings the Cenobites back in this movie is a twenty-something L.A. club owner who looks, talks, and acts likes a total jackass. With his shaved and toned chest, he seems like some kind of G.Q. or Playgirl reject who inexplicably got cast in a series which had established a seriousness and maturity with the first two movies. The heroine of this movie is played by a fairly likable actress, but her character isn't interesting and her dialogue/character building scenes come off as flat, like the director couldn't wait to get to the ""good"" parts.Also, the first two movies had a kind of stately British vibe to them. Part 3, on the other hand, is very obviously a lowest common denominator L.A. B movie. It tries hard to be ""hip"" (e.g. now very dated) with it's locations, rock music, and young cast. Sure, some of the 80's hairstyles of the first two films haven't aged all that well, but besides that the first two movie were not about fashion, they were sincere and moody explorations of sinister things. In part 3, the excruciating club scenes are shot and edited frantically, like a music video complete with mediocre 90's hard rock. Not even scary, odd that a ""horror"" movie would have long stretches that are not even tense, let alone scary.Being ""fashionable"" is something that badly hurt 90's horror. Jamie Lee Curtis wore J.C. Penney in Halloween; Tommy Hilfiger got his logo in the credits of The Faculty (1998). Another element to this is the dialogue content and delivery in 90's horror; in 70's and 80's horror characters even when teenage were more low-key and unpretentious. By the 90's it seemed like every script writer and actor came off as trying way to hard to make characters ""witty"" or ""clever"". In practice this led to snarky and shallow characters that were hard to relate to.The movie climaxes with an orgy of mass-violence (shot and edited in an overactive way, just like almost everything else in the movie) that reinforces the notion that overuse leads to boredom. Pinhead and his new cast of Cenobites (that are more poorly designed and acted than the earlier Cenobites) murder more people at a faster rate than any other ""slasher"" villain ever did. I'm sure it seemed cool at the time, but it's not scary and it destroys the credibility of the villains who were more restrained in the first two movies. Also, having everything be on ""Earth"" (or at least a theatrically flamboyant early 90's version of Earth) means that we don't get the ambitious Hellscapes that were well-realized in the 2nd movie. The stop-motion wonders of that film's climax are gone too, as for this movie it's just Pinhead and his new boring crew giving the F/X crew opportunities to hone their make-up wound skills. After you see a neck slash or head gouge for the tenth time, who cares? So it's a three for me. It isn't as aggressively sloppy as some of the other ""efforts"" of it's period, so if for no other reason than that, I'll give it credit.",Hellraiser III - Hell on Earth

I've seen them both recently and can say that as horror movies go they still hold up even after all this time.With the push for digital effects in movies going higher and higher, well they had to cut the budget somewhere. While this the 3rd movie in the series has more back story for the main villain Pinhead, the acting talent working opposite Doug Bradley is lacking. Thats not to say Terry Ferrel's is a bad actress just that her talents either aren't quite developed in this film or it was made in a hurry to meet a deadline.Gone are the cenobite assistants to Pinhead, replaced by a new cast of cenobites, most of which just feel cheep and cookie cutter made.Many of the characters come across as very fake, as if either the actors aren't all that good or the production was in a hurry to finish and didn't get the best performance from each cast member.Special Effects for the time were decent costumes were not bad. What struck me as odd was the heavy 80's look through out this film, despite the fact that it was filmed in 92 a time when grunge was on the rise.All in all this film is good if you enjoy the series, but if your new to horror or aren't really big on the genre then id avoid this film.",Hellraiser III - Hell on Earth

Monroe, Terri, Joey, these characters aren't that far behind the Cotton family, they share the same hedonistic, self-centered, obsessive, pleasure/pain driven behavior we expect in a Hellraiser movie. P.J. particularly is the perfect summoner of Pinhead. Self-indulgent, hedonistic, violent and violent obsessive, amoral and eager to go further in the realms of extreme experience. It should work with him. The plot is there, the lines are there, the scenes, the sets. In the paper, it seems very appealing, but in the screen, none of that shows up on screen. All the characters are pale, weak, like a bunch of lovesick teenagers waiting for something to happen in their lives.As the main roles can't convince the audience, the movie reveals exactly what it is: a gory horror movie, meant to shock the audience with graphic violence. And that's too bad, because you can't (I couldn't) get ultimately connected to it. Every now and then you get wondering about the quality of the blood or what's the best outfit among the cenobites, when you should be scared out. That's why this movie falls so far behind the original. It's ultimately shallow, a shell of the movie it could have been, if it was done the right way.But it is not that bad at all! Not at all! When Pinhead (and Cap. Spencer, in a smaller scale) is on screen, he breaths some fresh - or should I say filthy - air in the effort! He is cruel as ever and comes with a handful of cool lines (note the 'secret song' quote) that are rooted in the classic Barker material.The boiler room slaughter is a very strong scene, and the church mocking sequence is one of the most creative horror movie sequences I've ever seen. The video-taped Kirsty is also very cool, and it could have been explored in a better way.This movie is specially appealing for those who demand a larger screen time for Pinhead, as he didn't get much of it in both Hellraiser and Hellbound. Hell on Earth gives you loads of him!By the way, I have to state that Pinhead laughs a little to much in this, and I like the original ""shut face"" attitude of the first film best, but I admit this is just me.The new cenobites, in my opinion, can't get close the original group. They just don't share the same feel, and you can tell from the start they are a different breed. I personally like to think the cenobites in this movie as a Pinhead carved fake, not as actual Leviathan-made cenobites...I can't forget to mention the score. The songs played are O.K., but the score in itself, just like in Hellbound, is too weak!!!! It sounds like something you've heard before, but can't get you in the mood, i.e. elevator music. This movie could have been 50% if you only add a score at the same level as the original.All in all, this is a movie that was killed by its own director. Each and every flaw in it could have been avoided by a careful direction, but it seems that this one was more concerned in making cameo than making movie. I really wish somebody else had done it, and I wonder what a master such as Zack Snyder could have done with this material.Nevermind, Doug Bradley knows what this stuff is all about, and manages to save the day. So if Pinhead is dear to you, don't pass this by.",Hellraiser III - Hell on Earth

What a complete insult to all hellraiser fans. The cenobites are suppose to be both terrifying and sophisticated and not full of cheesy one liners. A Camera man, DJ and bartender cenobite? Come on!!! I'm glad that whoever came up with those cenobites either got fired or got a kick up the ass because Hellraiser 4 (bloodlines) saw the return of some really creative cenobites.Jesus wept........more like Clive Barker wept.If you loved the first two movies and want to carry on watching Hellraiser movies......then skip this load of dung and go straight on to Hellraiser: Bloodlines.",Hellraiser III - Hell on Earth

First it starts out showing jp (the medium-rich nightclub owner) buying a statue of distorted faces, one of which (THE MAIN ONE) is pinhead, there is the box stoned into it. Then joey's at the nightclub and sees doctors pulling in a boy all bloodied with chains impaling his body, later the chains shock him and you see his head explode and chunks of it go everywhere (A+ on the gore there!) So now Joey is working on the case, she makes friends with Terri and they kind of work together on the case. (SKIPPING AHEAD A FEW SCENES) THen it shows JP giving a rose to a pretty blone, then 1 minute later banging her in the room in front of the statue, eventually the blonde gets all mad and then yells at him backing up to the statue, then chains come flying out of the statue and rip off her epidermal layer, it is another A+ on the gore, then the chains suck her into the statue, basically Pinhead talks JP into getting women for him to (KILL/BRING TO HELL) So he gets Terri back and they fight after Terri knows what's going on then pinhead shoves 2 HUGE pistons into jp's head, impaling it (A- on the gore here) basically pinhead talks to Terri when he is out of the statue, then he walks into the nightclub and massacres it (A+++ on the gore here!) But you don't see it all eventually you have 40 ppl left and it shows the door with blood gushing under it. Joey calls the camera man to the site and joey leaves after him, she doesn't find the camera man (which is really like a main character) she goes up in the nightclub to find disturbing/gruesome dead bodies, some hanging by their tongues, all mutilated, skin ripped open, pool balls stuck in their throats, ew! (A+ on the gore here) then she see's the camera man dead with the camera stuck in his throat and his head in his hands, after talking to pinhead she runs out to find everything blowing up then she sees the camera man as a cenobite chasing her (NOT REALLY) well he kills a guy by the camera impaling his head! (A on the gore here) then it introduces the other new cenobites (the robot that throws like metal disks into ppls heads) who gives some nice bloody deaths to a guy and a policeman. YOu also see a big (medium fat) cenobite that breathes fire and pinhead, police cars pull up, shoot the cenobites, all they do is get knocked back a tad but keep on walking, they kill the cops (not really gory because the fire-breather blew up their cars, then we see the church scene which could be offensive to some viewers (NOTHING REALLY BAD BUT I WON'T EXPLAIN IT'S ONLY 3 MINUTES LONG)then Joey at the construction site to see the JP and Terri cenobites, eventually she opens the box at the site and traps the demons in the lament configuration! Then pinhead tricks her then pinheads human form argues with him and only here is a weird scene but joey wins it all.*NOTE YOU GET TO SEE KIRSTY A BIT IN A MENTAL INSTITUTION*Overall, a good bloody fun movie with some good acting and some freaky cenobites!7/10Rated R : Strong Graphic Violence and Grotesque/Gruesome images Sexuality, and language.",Hellraiser III - Hell on Earth
131,searching-13860,Hellraiser III: Hell on Earth is an entertaining picture,10,22 January 2016,"Hellraiser III: Hell on Earth takes place in the city streets, which are filled with apocalyptic imagery: crashed cars, fire, explosions. With this moment, the series has transitioned from the small-scale, intimate horror of Barker's original film to a more expansive, apocalyptic vision of Hell on Earth (as the title of this second sequel suggests). The new Cenobites come complete with catchphrases ('That's a wrap', Doc/the cameraman Cenobite asserts after killing a number of police officers), and in retrospect it's easy to see why Hellraiser III: Hell on Earth alienated some of the fans of the first two films, but it doesn't deserve the negative attention it deserves to be re evaluated and Hellraiser:Bloodline.The climax of Hellraiser III: Hell on Earth leads to a battle of wills between Spencer and Pinhead which employs some ugly-looking CGI morphing effects and might make the viewer think of the climactic 'mind battle' between telepathic brothers Darryl Revok (Michael Ironside) and Cameron Vale (Stephen Lack) in David Cronenberg's Scanners (1981). The film's final scenes contain what perhaps are some of its strongest ideas. After the threat represented by Pinhead and his Cenobites has been quashed, Joey wanders through the devastated city landscape and buries the Lament Configuration in some wet cement on a building site. Via a montage, we are shown a new building being constructed around the site where the puzzle box is buried – and outside this new building is a strange, esoteric statue, whilst inside the architectural style of the building has taken on the aesthetic of the puzzle box itself. There's a hint here of an exploration of the relationships between occultism and architecture – of the kind highlighted in the myths surrounding the architecture of Nicholas Hawksmoor. A classic film with an intriguing story ans good acting, it is well above the usual standards of the genre.",Hellraiser III - Hell on Earth

While I must admit I really really enjoyed this movie and probably enjoyed it most of all from the Hellraiser series from a visual standpoint, I can't really say I am going to give it a good review. Why you may ask? This one should have been the one to reveal Pinhead's past. How he got to be what he is....etc. He just kind of up and goes to earth through a statue and this is were the creepy storylines from the first one go sour really. It doesn't really have anything to do with the others. What's up with that woman's flashbacks of her father in the war. I can't remember very well but does it even explain that and it's connection to Pinhead? I don't think it did. Pinhead was never meant to be a slasher icon or anything like that....horror icon...maybe...not slasher but this movie becomes a slasher in the end and that changes Pinhead a little too much. So in the end...I find this movie to be eye candy and fun in that slasher feel....but not in the Hellraiser feel.",Hellraiser III - Hell on Earth

The stereotypical characters make me sick.  There's  the whiny girl with a bad case of PMS who thinks her life is miserable because her boyfriends have been mean to her.  There's the rich spoiled brat of a nightclub owner who entices countless women with mommy and daddy's money only to spit them out when he's done with them. However, what makes it all even worse is that Pinhead is the most stereotypical of all.  What was once a brilliant character is reduced to ""find all of the supermodel victims I can and kill them with my chains ala Freddy Kruger.""  The story has gone from a complex masterpiece from the genius mind of Clive Barker to a film more generic than Wes Craven's 'Scream' with the typical 'the bad guy is loose and we have to stop him' plot that has accompanied almost all other horror movies to date.  On a scale of 1 to 10 I'd have to give this movie a 1 compared to the 10 Id give it's predecessors.

139,sunejensen27,The Turning Point,2,5 September 2007,"This garbled, confused and at all stages, amateurish movie is the reason why the Hellrasier franchise has turned into nothing more than a incoherent series of proving grounds for b-movie directors.Whereas the first and the second movie, have a firm grip on the Hellraiser mythology in terms of themes and the more technical aspects, director Hickox makes sure to blunder his way through the process of crafting the movie, and to firmly stab the mythology in the back. Sub-par editing, bland acting and dull settings are just a few of the things that makes this Hellraiser one of the worst. Suffice it to say that it has as much quality as Hellworld, but whereas Hellworld only violates a series that was already dead, Hellraiser 3 loads, locks and fires the killing shot.Lets take a look at a few of the reasons, this trash is only worthy of scorn or even wrath:Whereas the first two feature Cenobites and their world as based outside traditional western belief system, and centers on more broad themes of lust and perversion , sure its called hell in the first two, but it is strongly implied that it is not connected to a contrary belief system; this is a hell that takes all comers, from the perverted (Frank)to the innocent (Kirsty). Hell itself is positioned in another dimension or even state of consciousness. Hellrasier 3 turns Pinhead into an antichrist figure and a harbinger for some sort of hell on earth. It completely ignores the previous notions of hell and seems intent of wrapping it into layman's definition of satanism and all its trappings . As a result the mythology ends up as pinhead and his minions packed into into the simplest of religious understanding.Pinhead is given way too much screen time in this one. One would have thought this was good, but since the script cannot handle the character with any sort of complexity or mystique, he ends up as buffoon. This is the exact point where Pinhead turned from the majestic emissary of lust and torment, and into the creature serving as plot device for moralistic horror clichés , as we have seen in the fifth, sixth, seventh and eight installments . The regal monologues seen earlier, has been replaced with a baser language and foolish one liners. During the film it got to the point were i half expected the character to fully make the transition to urban slang in order for the debasement to be complete.This assault on the series isn't done with visual subtlety either. The previous installments created doomy and intriguing imagery, using detailed sets, mysterious props and sheer presence from the actors. Hellrasier 3 used the standard action fare of exploding cars and flying glass, in the hopes that this will pass for horror. There's plenty of gore, as there should be in any Hellraiser film, but the inspired dispatchings are far in between, and Pinhead and crew seems more interested in getting the job done, than taking any pleasure in it. Its a classic case of quantity over quality.Instead of interesting and almost tragic (but never harmless) cenobites, we are presented with a gang of cenobites whose design seems to inspired by a casual glance round the scriptwriters apartment. These creatures are purely there to showcase creature fx, not because they serve the already barely coherent plot. As a result they all end up appearing shallow and certainly random. The story revolves partly around TV-reporter Joeys (played by looker Terry Farell, that seems to be incapable of expressing even the basest of emotions) investigation of a gory ""accident"" connected to a fancy nightclub, and partly on the owner of said nightclub. A few links to the originals are present, but the script fails to use any of these links successfully, and ends up with serious plot hole issues best ignored. The ending (and the events leading to it)is possibly the worst in any of the Hellraiser films yet , i lack words to describe my feelings about the nonsensical ending. Loathing is the word that might be most appropriate. It is evident that few of the involved had any love for the franchise. This movie was made purely for the studios coffers and the crews paychecks. We, as viewers, are poorer for it.",Hellraiser III - Hell on Earth

The effects were so overdone that I ended up laughing through most of the end.I didn't notice too many continuity errors tho, the only one I can think of off bat is when Terri is running from Pinhead, the fire hydrant blows off and floods the street and the power lines fall into the water and you can see the sparks in the water.

However, in this movie, Pinhead kills dozens of innocent people who never touched the box, and several of those victims were turned into Cenobites who later go after the heroine. Huh????

By now, I've just watched the first three films of the series. I very enjoyed the first two films, for they had a very cool and creepy atmosphere and were some masterpiece of dark art. But Hellraiser 3 never reaches the level of these two flicks. First of all I missed the great scenes in hell that made Hellraiser 2 such a great and stylish film. Secondly, the acting of some of the main characters is very bad, especially Terry, although the actress is very pretty. Thirdly, there is too much Pinhead. Don't get me wrong, as I already said above, I very like this character, but sometimes less is more, it should be something special and thus rare when he appears, and in this film he appears much too often. Though I liked the idea to bring his human form into play. What I also disliked is the whole disco setting. Although I'm a great Heavy Metal Fan, I didn't enjoy the whole thing, for it lacks the darkness that the first two films had in them.

He also is not as frightening because of the constant humor which is actually quite enjoyable. I enjoyed that this movie explained exactly where pinhead came from. I liked how at the end Both the previously human pinhead and pinhead joined as one in order to save the lead female. However, it would not be the end of pinhead. considering he comes back for the sequel Hellraiser: Bloodline.

146,searching-97445,"Hellraiser III: Hell on Earth"" The film unfolds as intelligently as it can. Good Adult Horror",10,25 January 2016,"Directed by Anthony Hickox and written by Peter Atkins, the film unfolds as intelligently as it can, under the circumstances. One piece de resistance has Pinhead dispatching every single patron of a crowded rock club, with weapons including flying, razor-sharp CD's. Another finds Joey, in one of the bizarre dream sequences that link this film to the ""Nightmare on Elm Street"" ethos, meeting Pinhead's nice-guy alter ego and being given the worst possible news: that the gateway to hell is somewhere in her apartment.A horror film that starts off in an art gallery deserves at least a little credit for upward mobility. And ""Hellraiser III: Hell on Earth"" is also commendable for helping to usher in the age of high-tech horror, with computer-generated special effects that bespeak a definite sophistication. That's not to say that a head isn't blown to bits 10 minutes into the story. But it does at least help make sense of this series and its considerable success.Pinhead's refined diction helps make him of interest to a more discerning audience, as does his way of expressing himself. ""There is a secret sound at the center of the world, and its sound is like razors through flesh,"" he tells the pert television reporter Joey Summerskill (Terry Farrell). ""I'm here to turn up the volume."" At first encased in a statue that is purchased by the vain, greedy rock club owner J. P.

The director and or producers decided to make Pinhead and the Cenobites 'cool' and 'fun' like the Nightmare on Elm Street series did with Freddy. This is basically a failure. Don't get me wrong, Pinhead has some good moments of dialog as he manipulates these idiotic characters from the pillar. But the one-liners were much too cheesy for my tastes. Anyhow here's the lowdown.The good: J.P. is a schmuck that you want to see killed by Pinhead. You get your wish. The club seems like a place I'd go if I were of age in '92. Terri was cool and hot. I wish she was the main character.The bad: Weak story. Joey. I found the character annoying. What a terrible name for a woman. The new cenobites were ridiculous. They gave them one liners.

Considering the first two films this one lacks in gore, story and concept.this film was made for one reason to introduce new cenobites, which i might add are not even in the future films, except for one brief moment. Not even long enough to warrant this film.I found this to be more of an embarrassment to the series.Now if you want a film that delves deeper into the History and background of the Box and the life of Pinhead as well the toymaker watch HR:BloodLines i found it to be much more satisfying, although I wanted more in it I felt it did more for the series.",Hellraiser III - Hell on Earth

Shot in NC, my home state this laughable ""sequel"" exceeds in only one thing, overdone B-horror cheese. The plot, which has basically little connection to the first two films, takes our viewers to what apparently the writer believed to be the counter-culture/underground rebellious youth scene of this time period. There a reporter runs about trying to stop Pinhead who for whatever reason is resurrected through from a stone statue. The worst parts of this film though have to be the new Sinnebites created specifically for this film. For whatever reason the creators decided to have 1, a demon created from a DJ that shoots CD's from his head, and 2, a demon created from a reporter that has a camera lens in his head he uses to smash people's skulls with.
