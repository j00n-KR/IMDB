0,TheLittleSongbird,Like a delicious looking but over-egged and bland tasting pudding,5,11 November 2018,"When seeing the trailer for 'The Nutcracker and the Four Realms' seeing 'Christopher Robin' in the cinema a few months ago, it immediately went high up on my most anticipated films of the year list and one of the films that left me desperate and impatient to see it. Simply adore the 'Nutcracker' story, have read it and seen the ballet and many adaptations of it so many times, and Tchaikovsky's music and the cast involved boasted a lot of talent. How could it go wrong?After seeing the less than favourable critical reception, my high expectations were lowered. Still saw it anyway being such a 'Nutcracker' fan and being determined to disagree with the critical consensus, thinking to myself could a film with such a promising trailer be that bad. My retrospective feelings are that 'The Nutcracker and the Four Realms' is not that bad and not one of the worst films of the year, plus it is much better than 'The Nutcracker 3D'. Unfortunately, count me in as someone who was disappointed, it may not one of the worst films of the year but it was one of the most disappointing. As a Disney fanatic too, while nowhere near as bad as 'A Wrinkle in Time' in particular of their relatively few misfires 'The Nutcracker and the Four Realms' is a lesser effort of theirs.Regarding how it fares as an adaptation, actually did not interpret, despite being led to believe otherwise, 'The Nutcracker and the Four Realms' as a straight up adaptation or re-imagining of the story. If anything it was more of a sequel to the original Hoffmann story, which is frequently referenced throughout, although the protagonist of most of the adaptations is named Clara the protagonist's name in Hoffmann's story is Marie, the name given to Clara's deceased mother in this film.Starting with the good things about 'The Nutcracker and the Four Realms', it looks fantastic and is a visual feast. The production, set and costume design are truly sumptuously opulent with amazing attention to detail and colours at pop out at you. The effects are well crafted if not quite as meticulous. Another strong asset is the music, there is a healthy dose of Tchaikovsky's 'The Nutcracker' throughout, incredible music embedded seamlessly. James Newton Howard's score sparkles with charm and magic that one wishes was with the rest of the film.It starts off very well, starting with a striking opening sequence and there is some emotion and sense of purpose to begin with, despite it not being much new. The ending was sweet, but the highlight scene was the ballet sequence detailing how their world was created, there was drama there and it was magnificent musically and in dancing (as well as being one of the few parts where anything was explained properly). The performances were variable, with some good performances and a lot of bad ones. Starting with the good, Mackenzie Foy does a fine job carrying the film and does have likeability.Matthew MacFadyen portrays the grieving and stern father well, and despite having far too little screen time Morgan Freeman brings mystery and gravitas to Drosselmeyer and barely recognisable Helen Mirren is an imperious Mother Ginger. Misty Copeland's effortless dancing is a major bonus, while the nuisance mouse indeed has more personality than most of the cast, and Gustavo Dudamel's contribution to the music performance should not be ignored, have no complaints regarding the orchestral playing or conducting, they bring the enchantment of the music wonderfully.Unfortunately, the sense of wonder seen and heard in the visuals and music are not there in the script and story. 'The Nutcracker and the Four Realms' is like a pudding that looks so delicious and beautiful, but when one bites into it it tastes over-egged texturally and doesn't have enough flavour while hardly unpalatable. The above actors are the only ones to come over well. Jacob Fowora-Knight is very wooden while Keira Knightley's simpering overacting becomes annoying. The rest of the cast struggle to register in pretty useless roles that are either merely plot-devices or out of place distractions. Have liked a good deal of Lasse Hallstrom's previous work, 'My Life as a Dog' is a favourite, but somehow there was the sense he was the wrong director and not entirely sure what to do with the film.Found the script too mechanical, bland and muddled, there was the sense too that it, like the story, wasn't sure whether it wanted to go the light-hearted, camp approach or serious approach. It tries to do both and executes both pretty poorly, the humorous elements clumsy, unfunny and out of place (annoying even) and the more serious elements taken too seriously that it robs the film of charm and magic and replaces it with a mean-spiritedness with a few darker elements (with some unintentionally creepy-looking harlequins that don't really do anything) that jar as much as the humour does.'The Nutcracker and the Four Realms' does lose momentum, to the point that the film becomes stuck when really it was the most urgent the film should have been, once Clara goes on the Fourth Realm quest. The final act suffers from a rushed and unexciting climax and a twist that was forced and actually guessable quite a fair bit of time before it was revealed. The film, on top of having a lot of over-familiar fantasy tropes, primarily suffers from a lack of emotion, magic and soul, all appearing in spurts (so at the beginning, the ballet sequence and the end), with much of the film feeling very hollow, flat characters that don't have much to engage properly with them let alone find them rootable and from feeling incomplete, disjointed and jumbled. The latter would have been rectified if the mythology of the Fourth Realm was explained much more (because that was very underdeveloped and confusing), that the Four Realms in general were gone into detail in much more because we don't learn much about them and if it tried to do quite a lot less and had a more focused tone. It tries to do too much and does little with it all.Overall, to me it was not that bad but it did disappoint on too many levels. Should have been a lot better. 5/10 Bethany Cox",The Nutcracker and the Four Realms
1,SnoopyStyle,extravagant without the magic,5,31 January 2019,"It's Christmas in Victorian London. Clara Stahlbaum (Mackenzie Foy) is excited when her father (Matthew Macfadyen) shows up with the kids' presents. Clara gets her late mother's ornate egg but the key is missing. The family attends a ball hosted by their godfather Drosselmeyer (Morgan Freeman). He had made the egg and key for her mother. Clara steps into an alternate world where a mouse steals her mother's key. She encounters the Nutcracker Captain Philip Hoffman (Jayden Fowora-Knight) who reveals that her mother was a beloved Queen and by definition, she is a respected Princess. The mouse gives the key to the evil Mother Ginger (Helen Mirren) in the Fourth Realm. Sugar Plum (Keira Knightley) explains that her mother used a machine to animate them and they need the machine to animate an army to defend against Mother Ginger. It needs the same key to turn on as the egg.The look is extravagance without the magic. It's CGI everywhere and it feels lifeless. I've always thought of Clara as a younger girl. Mackenzie Foy is around 17 and is more likely to be boy crazy. I wouldn't mind reworking that but the movie doesn't go there and Jayden Fowora-Knight is a dud anyways. The performances are pretty lifeless. The young leads are too stiff and the veterans are overwhelmed by the CGI. It's a reworking of the classic but I wish for more of the iconic music. The more recognizable music is relegated to the closing credits. It's a big epic but I'm never pull into it completely.",The Nutcracker and the Four Realms
2,Horst_In_Translation,Good fantasy movie especially for the holidays,6,12 December 2018,"""The Nutcracker and the Four Realms"" is a new American English-language film from 2018 and the most recent effort by Oscar-nominated director Lasse Hallström. His co-director is Oscar winner Joe Johnston and if you see for what and which category he won the Academy Award, it may be a bit surprising to see him attached to this project. But yeah, with these big names in charge of the production and of course the famous nutcracker reference in the title music-wise, it is no surprise this project attracted some big names. I knew Morgan Freeman would be in this one and while he is fun when he is on, he has only 2 very short scenes unfortunately that you can hardly call him part of the cast. Then again, the man is 80, so I'll forgive him. Macfadyen I am not too familiar with, but I guess especially female audience members will appreciate him early on and his dance scene at the very end. For the guys, the older ones, there is Oscar winner Helen Mirren playing the initial main antagonist and for the younger ones we get Keira Knightley playing the actual main antagonist and yeah what can I say I am a fan of the latter, so I enjoyed her presence, even more so as I did not know she would be in this one and she has a lot of screen time. Well, early on you could say she goes a bit too much over the top, but when we find out her character was just playing a role, it all makes sense again. That wig though lol. I had a feeling early on that it may not all be right here what seems right and it did turn out this way. Also her preference for armed soldiers, even if they were just creatures without souls was disturbing to say the least. I also found the first clown sequence a bit disturbing, even if we find out eventually that these are not the bad guys, must be my ambivalent relationship towards clowns.The main character is played by Mackenzie Foy, not related to Claire, and people who've seen Twilight will perhaps appreciate her in here. I think she is okay, does not make a huge difference, but there is also hardly any baity material to her character. The one huge letdown from the cast is Jayden Fowora-Knight, who was painfully bad at times with his line delivery (or the dub was just weak), but even next to the mediocre Foy, he seemed like a bit of an amateur really. They should have cast somebody better for a character with so much screen time. As a consequence I was almost glad that they did not develop a romance story between him and Foy's character, probably to keep it harmless for very young audiences, but well this would have been even more cringeworthy I guess. Now as for the story itself, it needed a while to get going I suppose, but then it was as simple as it was adorable. Maybe fantastic even. With which I mean fantasy and not that it was that great. It was okay I suppose. But not a must-see by any means. What did stand out here were all the visual aspects: costumes, effects, sets, make-up... Okay I did not like that the main character ran around half of the film in something that resembled a circus uniform, but that was my only criticism. There were sets and locations where I really wanted to be with the characters, especially those that offered a whole lot of snow. It was a beautiful film from that perspective, almost Oscar-worthy and I am curious if it can score a nomination or two in that department. I have a feeling it won't though. A bit of a pity. Now as for the ending, I think there is an option that we can get a sequel next year or in 2020. We will see about that. I think the first film here was good enough for me to give a second film a chance. Pretty enjoyable and I also liked that Knightley's character had to shrink eventually and that the main character's attempts in convincing her that she is just acting from grief and not a bad person stayed unsuccessful as honestly it would have felt maybe a bit too forced for a happy ending with everybody being alive, happy, united and best friends all out of nowhere. By the way, why did Knightley get first credit at the end? Anyway, I'm glad she was in it. I sure think she elevated the material and I wasn't even sure initially if it is really her or just a look-alike. That's all. Nice to see American kids films with so many big names in the cast. Here in Germany, it is very common, but in the US, films that are primarily made for children do not really offer a huge quantity of stars usually. Maybe this one can change things a bit to that regard. I give it a thumbs-up and positive recommendation. It's definitely not as bad as critics say only because it does not offer very complicated scenarios and plot twists. Okay the title may not be perfect as we find out nothing at all about 2 realms, only very little about one realm (Mirren's), but yeah this may also be a chance for a sequel to further elaborate in that department.",The Nutcracker and the Four Realms
3,claudio_carvalho,Beautiful Entertainment for Children,6,9 June 2020,"In the Victorian England, the teenager Clara (Mackenzie Foy) is a young scientist that lives with her older sister Louise (Ellie Bamber), her younger brother Fritz (Tom Sweet) and her widower father Mr. Stahlbaum (Matthew Macfadyen). The family misses their mother and wife Marie Stahlbaum (Anna Madeley), who was also a scientist and has recently passed away. On the Christmas Eve, Mr. Stahlbaum delivers a gift left by Marie for each sibling and Clara receives an egg-shaped locked box without a key to open it. The family goes to the ball promoted by Clara's godfather Drosselmeyer (Morgan Freeman), who is also a man of science, to spend the night and she asks for the key to him. When Mr. Drosselmeyer delivers his gifts for each child he is hosting, Clara crosses the boundary of a world created by her mother, where Clara is a princess, and ruled by the regents of the realms Land of Snowflakes, Land of Flowers, and Land of Sweets that protect them from Mother Ginger (Helen Mirren), who is the tyrant of the Fourth Realm in the beginning of an adventure full of fantasy and betrayal.""The Nutcracker and the Four Realms"" is a beautiful family entertainment for children. The cinematography and CGI are amazing and will certainly satisfy the target audience. The cast has names such as Helen Mirren, Morgan Freeman and Keira Knightley, but the lead actress Mackenzie Foy is weak. Unfortunately, the story is silly for adults, and the film does not have any heart. Lasse Hallström is a magnificent director, but this movie is bureaucratic and shows no emotion. My vote is six.Title (Brazil): ""O Quebra-Nozes e os Quatro Reinos"" (""The Nutcracker and the Four Realms"")",The Nutcracker and the Four Realms
4,nogodnomasters,Everything you need is inside,8,11 November 2018,I have not seen any other adaption to make negative comparisons. I found the fairy tale to be delightful and a powerful positive role model for young girls who can be both a scientist and a princess. I thought Mackenzie Foy nailed her role. I honestly expected more music.,The Nutcracker and the Four Realms
5,lee_eisenberg,about what I expected,5,4 November 2018,"Ah, ""The Nutcracker"". That novel-turned-ballet that's become a Christmas tradition. I saw a stage production of the ballet in 2015, and it was one of the most impressive things ever. You've no doubt heard at least one of Pyotr Chaikovsky's songs from the ballet.There have been occasional movie adaptations of the story. The latest is ""The Nutcracker and the Four Realms"", which expands the story. The movie was pretty much what I expected: nothing terrible, but no masterpiece by any stretch. It tried to be so much at once that it became sensory overload at times. The protagonist's father came across as sort of a predator also. Rather creepy in that sense.Now the good things about it. The visuals are a sight for sore eyes, and the protagonist is a princess, but not one merely waiting for a man to sweep her off her feet; she discovers that she has a goal to achieve, and sets about doing so (which Joseph Campbell described as the hero's journey). And as has happened in a number of Disney's movies in the 21st century, a presumably good character turns out to be a villain (a far cry from their movies in which being ""pretty"" automatically makes her good).Basically, you'll be disappointed if you expect a great movie. ""The Nutcracker and the Four Realms"" is anything but, especially since the Nutcracker himself is only a supporting character. If you merely expect an entertaining movie, you'll be satisfied. This is NOT a horrible movie; having seen ""Mac and Me"", ""The Flintstones"", ""Everyone Says I Love You"", ""Eyes Wide Shut"" and ""Man on the Moon"", I know how to define a horrible movie. Just accept it as a lighthearted mediocrity.",The Nutcracker and the Four Realms
6,tavm,The Nutcracker and the Four Realms is good family enertainment from Disney,7,10 November 2018,"Just watched this with my movie theatre-working friend. We both enjoyed this adaptation of the various ""Nutcracker Suite""s on film from the Disney company. It involves a young girl who lost her mother and is distant from her father and siblings when they go to a party. Then she experiences an adventure that may change her for the good. Because of some set pieces, it's not always easy to understand what's going on but it never lags in energy so there's that. So on that note, The Nutcracker and the Four Realms is good, not great entertainment.",The Nutcracker and the Four Realms
7,writers_reign,Nutcreaker,3,3 November 2018,"Despite knowing that Keira Knightly is to acting what Jeremy Corbyn is to Grand Opera I ponied up at the Box Office having failed to make even a cursory check and so under the impression that if nothing else my ears would be in for a treat via the ballet music. Boy, did I get a wrong number. What I did get - during the time I wasn't actually asleep was a fakokta from which Disney may well never recover. Appalling, atrocious - and that's only the A's. Luckily I wasted less than two hours which I'll still never get back.",The Nutcracker and the Four Realms
8,Calicodreamin,Loose adaptation,5,4 December 2019,"A loose interpretation of the famous play. While most of the characters are there, and the beginning and end are essentially the same, the middle bit is all different. I found the storyline to be well developed, the music payed homage, and the acting fairly good. However, the mound of mice was disturbing, and the sugar plums voice annoying... not sure it all really worked together.",The Nutcracker and the Four Realms
9,neil-476,"Derivative, but that won't matter for kids",7,10 November 2018,"Clara's mother died. The family feels it keenly, Clara and her father particularly, but they attend the grand Chhristmas party thrown by Clara's beloved godfather Drosselmeyer anyway. And the present he gives her leads to a magical realm where she must pick a side and fight for what's right.This Disney Christmas family film has a story made up of bits and pieces from all sorts of sources, bolted together into a narrative of great, if non-specific, familiarity. We have the original The Nutcracker And the Mouse King on which the Tchaikovsky/Petipah ballet was based, but among the other more obvious inspirations are The Wizard Of Oz, The Lion The Witch And The Wardrobe, and Alice In Wonderland.They work well enough to create a film which, I suspect, will become a family favourite, with exotic fantasy locations, some pleasing jeopardy, decent effects, and fun performances, not to mention a little bit of heart.McKenzie Foy (the creepy half-CGI Renesmee in the final Twiglet movie) is adequate as Clara, but Jayden Fowora-Knight makes little impression as the Nutcracker. The pleasure is in the stars who play the incidental characters - Morgan Freeman as Drosselmeyer, Helen Mirren as Mother Ginger, Kiera Knightley as an unbelievably sugary Sugar Plum Fairy etc.There is a moderate amount of the ballet music, and a small amount of well-presented dancing. It is utterly derivative, but fairly enjoyable for all that.",The Nutcracker and the Four Realms
10,ferguson-6,not your parents' nutcracker,6,2 November 2018,"Greetings again from the darkness. Missing: Tchaikovsky and Ballet. OK, not missing entirely, and it seems all we do is beg for creativity and new approaches in movies, so let's give this one fair treatment. It's not the traditional ""Nutcracker"" holiday fare you've come to expect on stage, on TV, in the mall, at schools, and just about everywhere. Instead, it's a version wrung from both the 1816 original short story ""The Nutcracker and the Mouse King"" by E.T.A. Hoffman and the 1892 ballet by Marius Petipa with music from Tchaikovsky, yet also something quite different. Still, different doesn't always mean better ... sometimes it just means different.We are treated to a beautiful extended opening shot as an owl swoops through old London. This acts as preparation for the abundance of stunning visuals headed our way throughout. Budding star Mackenzie Foy (INTERSTELLAR, 2014) plays Clara Stahlbaum, a young girl distraught that it's her first Christmas without her beloved mother Marie, who recently passed away. Clara's quietly grieving father (Matthew Macfadyen) delivers the presents Marie left for each of the three kids. Mechanically inclined Clara's gift is an ornate egg that requires a specialty key to unlock the hidden message Clara believes her mother has left.A lavish Christmas party at her Godfather's (Oscar winner Morgan Freeman) mansion leads Clara to a parallel universe where her mother Marie was Queen of the four realms. This is a fantastical land that reminds (maybe a bit too much) of Tim Burton's ALICE IN WONDERLAND and the classic THE WIZARD OF OZ. Clara buddies up with a live Nutcracker soldier Phillip (newcomer Jayden Fowora-Knight), who quickly becomes her trusted bodyguard. Land of Snowflakes, Land of Flowers, Land of Sweets, and the blighted Fourth Realm run by a cast-out Mother Ginger (Oscar winner Helen Mirren) make up this world. Keira Knightley stars as the Sugar Plum Fairy, and her devilishly fun performance is responsible for most of the energy, humor and entertainment outside of the visual effects. The two time Oscar nominee seems to relish the voice, the costumes and the chance to play a quirky character.Disney touches like the animal sidekicks are noted: Phillip's loyal steed, and the pesky little mouse that flashes more personality than anyone in the film outside of Sugar Plum. Most of the comedic secondary characters (including Richard E Grant and Eugenio Derbez) fall flat with very little do in a screenplay from Ashleigh Powell that gives the impression of multiple hands in the pie. Adding to the disjointed feel and lack of cohesion in the story flow is the fact that two very different directors worked on the project. Lasse Hallstrom (CHOCOLAT) handled principal photography and then Joe Johnston (CAPTAIN AMERICA: THE FIRST AVENGER) spent a month on re-shoots with attention to visual effects. The contrasts between these two directors is quite clear in the finished project despite the cinematographer of Oscar winner Linus Sandgren (LA LA LAND).The mishmash of styles and tone prevents us from ever really connecting with characters or being drawn in by the story, but beyond that, there are some really terrific visuals and special effects. I especially liked the look of the enhanced tin soldiers and the work of two time Oscar winning costume designer Jenny Beavan. Of course, this is a familiar story and many viewers bring certain expectations into the theatre with them. The iconic Tchaikovsky music is played early and throughout the film, though mostly in teases and in blends with new music from James Newton Howard. We do get a glimpse of Maestro Gustavo Dudamel conducting the orchestra, and for those expecting ballet, the fabulous Misty Copeland performs a couple of times, though it's likely not enough for those hoping for more of a ballet production. The end result is an impressive visual experience that will likely still disappoint those looking for another holiday watching tradition.",The Nutcracker and the Four Realms
11,FeastMode,my notes,2,27 July 2019,Visually stimulating. a good lead performance. everything else is abysmal. so many hilariously dumb moments. i laughed a lot. so many things that tried to be cool were just lame. and the rest of the performances were laughably over the top (1 viewing),The Nutcracker and the Four Realms
12,ThomasDrufke,Bland,5,11 November 2018,"With a great streak of live action films, Disney takes a step back with Nutcracker. It's not the fall from grace that say, Maleficent felt like, but it's just a bland adaptation of beloved source material. There's just nothing special or significant about this version of The Nutcracker. It has gorgeous visuals, production & costume design, and a wealth of fantastic actors, but the script and direction feel incomplete. And I actually love a few of Lasse Hallstrom's films, so I was hopeful he could bring something special to Nutcracker, but having an inexperienced writer in Ashleigh Powell, perhaps wasn't the best decision. Or perhaps even more realistic, is that The Nutcracker (as a play) just isn't the easiest to translate into a straight narrative film. Either way, you can certainly skip this one.5.0/10",The Nutcracker and the Four Realms
13,westsideschl,More Mechanical Than You Would Want,4,4 February 2019,"The acting, dialogue & script was more mechanical than the mechanical tin soldiers. Lots of emphasis in this film (emotionless, lacking in feeling) on CGI, and costuming. Most disturbingly was the unrealistic, image portrayal being pushed onto young females that there is only one perfect look to have a beautiful life. Most disturbingly was the unrealistic image portrayal being pushed onto young females that there is only one perfect look to have a beautiful life. Thin, cute w/lots of cosmetics to hide any blemishes.

An attempt is made to make our female new age intelligent by being physics & mechanically literate, but it came across as hokey fake - not real.",The Nutcracker and the Four Realms
14,tabuno,"A decent, memorable, if not top brilliant classic of a movie",8,28 January 2019,"Supposedly it took two directors to finish and wrap up this gorgeous fantasy movie with a lot of post-production editing. Inspired by the short Nutcracker story, this movie would never be a The NeverEnding Story (1984) movie based on Michael Ende's international best-seller nor The Chronicles of Naria: The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe (2005) based on C.S. Lewis. Nevertheless, the story outline flows together most likely because of the tight editing. From the very beginning the sweeping camera photography enwraps its audience into a delightful collage of old sites of Victorian England. The set design and amazing landscapes are brilliant. The performance captivating, even the father whose stoic face is betrayed with small poignant pauses and looks of subtle emotional despair. Somewhat predictable along with a harsh but maybe unavoidable twist, the movie seems to transform from magical, fantastic mystery along with the royal flourishes of The Princess Diaries (2001) to a more simple dichotomous clash between good and evil. Nevertheless, the simple ending surprisingly is a pleasant soft surprise with its relational bonding scene along with a delightful series of ballet dance numbers during the closing credits. This was a decent, memorable, if not top brilliant classic of a movie.",The Nutcracker and the Four Realms
15,Thanos_Alfie,Different plot...,5,20 January 2019,"""The Nutcracker and the Four Realms"" is an Adventure - Family movie in which we watch a young girl going to a party with her brother, her sister and her father. There she is transported into a magical world where she has to find some answers about her mother and the gift she left her after her death. With the answers, she has also to find a key which is very important not only for her but for the whole magical world.I liked this movie because it surprised me with its plot. It was very different from the previous Nutcracker movies that I had seen. I enjoyed very much the beautiful costumes. About the direction which was made by Lasse Hallström and Joe Johnston I found it very interesting and I liked very much their idea of having a ballet scene at some point of their movie. Regarding the interpretations, I have to admit that I was happily surprised by the interpretation of Mackenzie Foy who played as Clara and she was very good. Some other interpretations that have to be mentioned were Jayden Fowora-Knight's who played as Phillip, Keira Knightley's who played as Sugar Plum and Morgan Freeman's who played as Drosselmeyer and gave a different touch in this movie.Finally, I have to say that ""The Nutcracker and the Four Realms"" is a great family movie, with a very different plot than the original Nutcracker movies but equally interesting. I recommend everyone to watch this movie because I am sure that you are going to enjoy it. If you want to watch a classic Nutcracker movie then you should watch one of the previous movies and not this one, but if you want to watch a different movie than the previous then this is the movie you should watch.",The Nutcracker and the Four Realms
16,cruise01,A coming of age fantasy tale that could have been so much more.,6,3 November 2018,"The Nutcracker and the Four Realms (3 out of 5 stars).The Nutcracker and the Four Realms is a decent fantasy adventure film that retells or is loosely retelling the The Nutcracker story. It is flashy with costumes, set design, hair and make up, and visual effects. But the story does feel like it is crossing similar grounds to the Narnia movies or Alice in Wonderland. It is not a bad or terrible film. It is entertaining and fun for the whole family. Especially for the holidays and Christmas season.The plot follows Clara (Mackenzie Foy) who travels to a mystical world of four realms. When she is trying to discover a missing key for her gift. She runs into the sugar plum (Keira Knightley), Hawthrone (Eugenio Derbez), Shiver (Richard E. Grant), and the mother Ginger (Helen Mirren) who apparently is trying to take over all the realms. Clara has to find the missing key and fight the dark army of nutcrackers and to claim the throne that belongs to her.The plot feels similar to Narnia. But it was nonetheless entertaining. Clara feeling a little lost with her family. And her father wanting her and her siblings to go to a Christmas party. From there, she falls into a fantasy world that is thrown into chaos. Where she needs to fight off the evil and make everything right was great.The direction did feel a little dull with the film. The overbearing visual effects were questionable. A lot of moments were you could tell it was green screen or the cgi did not feel like it was completed. From the beginning moments of the outlook of London looked terrible and like a bad cgi scene from The Polar Express movie.The costumes, set design, and make up were flashy and characterized like it was an Alice in Wonderland movie. Mackenzie Foy gave a beautiful performance. Keira Knightley as Sugar Plum was also a fun performance. Eugenio Derbez and Richard E. Grant barely had anything to work with. Helen Mirren was also okay playing Ginger.The film had a fair share of action with Clara facing against the mice army and nutcrackers.Overall, The Nutcracker and the Four Realms was a fair fantasy adventure film. The plot is shadowed by its overbearing iffy visual effects, costumes and set designs. Mackenzie Foy does shine with a beautiful performance. But the movie will be quite forgettable.",The Nutcracker and the Four Realms
17,pennyelenabooks,Good Enough,6,21 January 2019,"I didn't hate the movie. For a childrens' one, it was nice and entertaining. The CGI were good and the whole four realm world was presented decently. The story was okay as well, though predictable. Also, they kind of messed up the explanation on the existence of the realms. And the nutcracker had little say in the story. But, overall, I wasn't bored. So 6 out of 10.",The Nutcracker and the Four Realms
18,leonblackwood,Really poor movie but the sets are spectacular!,3,15 March 2019,"Review:
What a total waste of time and money! This typical Disney movie, certainly looked spectacular and the various sets were truly amazing, but I struggled to keep my eyes open through the whole movie. The period drama tone was set right from the beginning, and then it seemed to go all ""Narnia"" in the middle. The storyline was pretty awful, along with the uninteresting characters, who became pretty annoying after a while. I found the plot quite patronising and predictable throughout, and it amazed me how nothing seemed to faze the main character, who found herself in this magical world all by herself. It's saving grace was the attention to detail, and vibrate colours which looked great on the big screen but apart from that, it really wasn't that entertaining. I was hoping for some adult wit or at least good performances that would make it watchable, but it really failed in that department. Even the big names, like Morgan Freeman, Helen Mirren and Kiera Knightley, didn't make a big impact in the film, which is mainly down to the poor adaptation of this well-known tale. Anyway, the film kicks off in Victoria London on Christmas Eve, were Mr. Stahlbaum (Matthew Macfadyen), gives his children the Christmas presents his wife Marie had set aside for them before she died. The younger daughter, Clara (Mackenzie Foy), receives a handcrafted egg-shaped box, which she is unable to unlock. The Stahlbaum family then heads to a Christmas Eve ball, hosted by the children's godfather and skilled engineer Drosselmeyer (Morgan Freeman). Refusing to dance with her father, Clara scurries from the crowd to ask Drosselmeyer how to unlock her egg. He then reveals to Clara that the egg was a creation of his that he gifted to Clara's mother when she was younger and that her mother's wish was to bestow the gift to her daughter. Drosselmeyer announces that it's time for the children to open their gifts, and Clara finds her string with her name on it, signifying her gift. The string takes her to a forest in a parallel world where she sees the key for her egg. Before she can grab the key, a mouse snatches it, and she's unable to reach the mouse because it crosses a frozen-over river. Clara approaches Captain Philip Hoffman (Jayden Fowora-Knight) the Nutcracker, who leads her across the bridge into the Fourth Realm, but they are unable to obtain the key from the mice. Philip then guides Clara to the palace, where she meets three regents of each land from the Sugar Plum Fairy (Keira Knightley) of the Land of Sweets, Shivers (Richard E. Grant) of the Land of Snowflakes, and Hawthorne (Eugenio Derbez) of the Land of Flowers. They tell Clara that they are at war with the Land of Amusements which they now refer to as the Fourth Realm. Watching a ballet that tells the story of their world's creation, the Sugar Plum Fairy explains to Clara that her mother created this world as a young girl. She later explains that her mother animated everyone with a machine that can turn toys into real-life people. Sugar Plum says that she can use this machine to defend the other three realms against Mother Ginger (Helen Mirren), the regent of the Fourth Realm, but it needs a key. Clara notices that the machine's keyhole matches that of the one on her egg. Clara and her soldiers head towards Mother Ginger and steal the key the mouse had snatched. However, Clara is disappointed upon discovering that the egg is only a music box. Once Sugar Plum obtains the key, she uses the machine to turn toy soldiers into life-size soldiers that obey her every command, including her command to attack the Fourth Realm. She then reveals that she had lied about Mother Ginger who, with her people, resisted against Sugar Plum's plan of taking over all four realms in revenge for her perceived abandonment by Marie and that the machine can turn this world's people back into toys as well, intending that to be the fate of the other regents who resist her. Sugar Plum then imprisons Clara, Captain Philip, Shivers, and Hawthorne. Clara and the other prisoners escape and she and Captain Philip are then greeted by one of Mother Ginger's mice who shows Clara another way into the machine room and guides Captain Philip to Mother Ginger to convince her to help Clara overthrow Sugar Plum. Clara enters the machine room and shuts down the machine whilst fighting off soldiers. Mother Ginger comes to her aid and helps her to fight off the soldiers. Sugar Plum ultimately traps Mother ginger and attempts to turn her back into a toy with the machine. However, Clara tinkers with the machine so that it aims at Sugar Plum, which zaps her and turns her back into a porcelain doll as punishment for high treason to the Realms, deactivating her army and saving Mother Ginger. With the Realms restored to peace, Clara promises to visit the Realms in the future and returns back to London. As I said earlier, total garbage! With such a huge budget and some decent actors, Disney made a right mess of this classic book. Personally, I thought that the girl who played Clara was bland and boring, and the ridiculous climax at the end was terrible. Anyway, I think you can tell that I wasn't impressed with this film, but I can see the young ones enjoying it. Saying that it didn't really smash the box office, and it didn't go down to well with the critics so it seems like a lot of people have the same view as me. Disappointing!Round-Up:
This movie was directed by Lasse Hallstrom and Joe Johnston. Lasse Hallstrom brought you many of the ABBA videos in the 70's and 80's, Once Around, What's Eating Gilbert Grape, Something To Talk About, The Cider House Rules, Chocolat, The Shipping News, Casanova, An Unfinished Life, The Hoax, Hachi: A Dog's Tale, Dear John, Salmon Fishing in the Yemen, The Hypnotist, Safe Haven, The Hundred-Foot Journey and A Dog's Purpose. Joe Johnston has brought you Honey, I Shrunk The Kids, Rocketeer, The Pagemaster, Jumanji, October Sky, Jurassic Park III, Hidalgo, The Wolfman, Captain America: The First Avenger and Not Safe For Work. He is due to direct The Chronicles Of Narnia: The Silver Chair, which is in development, so he hasn't let the disappointment of this movie hold him back. Both of these directors have an impressive back catalogue, so I can only put it down to a failure in the collaboration department, why this film was so poor. I just hope they don't decide to do a sequel!Budget: $120million

Okay, I guess we can pretty safely asume that something called marketing is the reason here.Anyway, this one is like cotton candy - it tastes good but if you get too much of it you get no yummy in your tummy but some bad achy.The Nutcracker and the Four Realms is an okay flick if you want to watch it with your kids, as the movie got some nice visuals as an adult you got a good chance to survive the experience without too heavy damage.",The Nutcracker and the Four Realms

21,southdavid,Lackluster and the Bore Realms,3,20 November 2018,"Oh, good lord it's horrible. I try to see the best in most film and TV I see, I really do - but this one is a challenge to find anything.So, in classic Disney fashion, a (wealthy) Victorian family in London are about to celebrate their first Christmas since the matriarch of the family has passed away. The father of the family, played by Matthew MacFadyen, insists that his three children attend their Godfathers annual Christmas party, at which his middle daughter Clara (Mackenzie Foy) discovers an access portal to the four secret realms, where her mother acted as queen.From there, the film is very much a cannibalisation of other Disney films, thrown together in a desperate attempt to lengthen the plot to feature length. Principle target is the Tim Burton ""Alice In Wonderland"" films, though there's bits of ""Mary Poppins"" and a healthy dose of a live action ""Fantasia"". The trouble is, it's boring. Irredeemably boring. It generally looks quite nice but I couldn't make myself care about any of it. Its plot twist is obvious, its characters are annoying, its hilariously cruel in its dismissal of the value of the other two children and it's comic relief are never either (Poor Jack Whitehall's Disney career gets off to a bad start). Even if you like Ballet, it only really features in a couple of scenes.In terms of things I liked, I'll not criticise Mackenzie Foy - she does a reasonable job with what she has to work with. Keira Knightly in the second half of the film looks like she's having fun, even if the audience isn't.It tells you everything that Disney pushed ""Solo's"" release forward by six months, to make sure that it stayed away from their impending ""Mary Poppins"" juggernaut, but were happy to release this, which, on the surface, is a much more comparable film. If they had no faith in the end product, why should you.",The Nutcracker and the Four Realms
22,lisafordeay,Not a bad film,6,5 November 2018,"The Nutcracker and The Four Realms is based on the ballet on The Nutcracker and stars Mackenzie Foy from Twilight Breaking Dawn Part 1 and 2 and tells the story of a young girl named Clara who goes off on an adventure to find the missing key which opens a mysterious gift that she got for Christmas from her deceased mother. She teams up with the nutcracker and meets an overbearing fairy called The Sugar Plum Fairy played by Kiera Knightly and sets out to defeat Mother Ginger played by Helen Mirren. But is Mother Ginger all that bad?
Overall the cinematography was beautiful to look at,the acting was ok I guess Kiera Knightly though irritated me in this film with her annoying accent and the story has alot of twists and turns. I was disappointed though and this maybe a spoiler that Clara ends up not being with the nutcracker in the end as I suppose since Kiera banned her daughter from watching The Little Mermaid and Cinderella where she quotes""I don't want my daughter to watch these simply because both women want the man to save them and that her daughter would except that men are all charming in real life. To me im 27 years old and I love fairytales and I got on OK in life.
If you are looking for a christmas movie then check it out. For me I felt I was watching a Tim Burton film with music from Danny Elfman(even though it was directed by the guy who brought you Jumanji 1995).Its an OK movie but its nothing spectacular. My advice go watch A Star Is Born instead.

This is a Disney movie that I think should have been released a little closer to Christmas. It seems like it would be a better time for it-not right after Halloween. Mackenzie plays a young girl that is celebrating her first Christmas since her mother's death. As you can guess, it's not a happy time for her. That is until she opens a present her mother left for her. The only problem is that she can not open it-it needs a key. Her mother was an inventor and left her the puzzle and Morgan-a close friend of her mother's-helps point Mackenzie to an alternate world in search of the key, where she also learns about secrets that her mother had. This new world has 4 realms-Land of Snowflakes, Land of Flowers, Land of Sweets and the dreaded fourth mysterious realm-with Keira and Helen as two of the rulers. There are several dance numbers, including ballet, and the music is a mixture of both new and old-New being James Newton Howard and old being Tchaikovsky. It was an enjoyable movie but I just think it would do better box office if it would have been released closer to Christmas.
It's rated ""PG"" for mild peril and has a running time of 1 hour & 39 minutes.

As a whole, though, it isn't good - despite neat effects and a couple of big names.Keira Knightley (Sugar Plum), Helen Mirren (Mother Ginger) and Morgan Freeman (Drosselmeyer) are familiar faces and are enjoyable on a base level, but their characters are rather forgettable. Mackenzie Foy (Clara) and Jayden Fowora-Knight (Philip) are decent together, while Jack Whitehall (Harlequin) and Omid Djalili (Cavalier) are smart casts - if underused.It's the plot that lets this down, it just all makes for underwhelming viewing - I, personally, never got into it.

28,kirbylee70-599-526179,CLASSIC TALE REBOOTED,8,11 February 2019,"Most of us have grown up with the music of Tchaikovsky's ""The Nutcracker"" flowing through our minds and in our ears every Christmas season. The ballet around the music has been performed for decades and the story filmed in different ways from filming that ballet to involving Barbie in the mix. So to hear that a new version of the story was coming from Disney was no huge surprise. What is surprising is that rather than retell the story they've created their own based not on the ballet but on E.T.A. Hoffman's short story ""The Nutcracker and the Mouse King"". From that we are presented with THE NUTCRACKER AND THE FOUR REALMS.In Victorian London, England, the Stahlbaum family is preparing for Christmas. It will be their first without Mrs. Stahlbaum who passed away. On Christmas Eve each child is given a present that their mother left for them by their father (Matthew Macfadyen). The gift young Clara (Mackenzie Foy) receives is an ornate egg created by Mr. Drosselmeyer (Morgan Freeman) with a lock but no key.The family goes to the annual Christmas Eve party hosted by Mr. Drosselmeyer, Clara's godfather and stepfather to her mother. Drosselmeyer is a tinkerer, a man who knows how things work and who created many intricate items from clocks to toys. His home is like a museum with myriad rooms to venture in. He has Clara help him with a problematic toy, knowing her penchant to tinker with things much like himself. Before they can discuss the egg it becomes time for him to present all the children in attendance with their gifts.Each child must follow a string from the garden tree to their gift. As Clara follows hers she finds herself transported to another world altogether. When she goes to take her gift, the key that she seeks, it is stolen by a mouse. She pursues the mouse until it cross the thin ice of a river. Clara goes to a bridge to cross as well and encounters Captain Philip Hoffman the Nutcracker (Jayden Fowora-Knight). When she tells him who she is, he realizes she is the daughter of Marie who was once the queen of the Four Realms. He escorts her to the main land among the four and introduces her to the rulers of 3 of the 4 realms.They are comprised of the Sugar Plum Fairy of the Land of Sweets (Keira Knightley), Shivers of the Land of Snowflakes (Richard E. Grant), and Hawthorne of the Land of Flowers (Eugenio Derbez). They glowingly welcome her but inform her that the ruler of the fourth realm, Mother Ginger (Helen Mirren) is trying to dismantle everything her mother created. Only with her help can they restart the engine that will allow them to protect themselves. And that engine needs the same key that Clara is searching for.The movie has a few plot twists that some will see coming an others will be stunned by. It weaves together the original story that Tchaikovsky created years ago along with the music he composed but in small doses rather than centering the entire tale around it. And the one piece that uses the most of his music tends visually to make one think of MOULIN ROUGE rather than the typical ballet with the style in which it's presented. It still makes for an eye catching rendition.But does it work? Well in many ways yes but not always. The movie feels like one I'd have to watch a second time to fully enjoy. There is so much to see here from the opening sequence that takes us on a flying journey of London via CGI to the various locations of the Four Realms. And the film moves along at breakneck speed with little time to stop and consider what is transpiring. There is a lack of depth to the characters with the exception of Clara which doesn't hinder the film but leaves you wishing perhaps we had more of several of those characters as well.
NU
With the movie coming out on disc as winter is supposed to be dwindling some might not want to purchase the film as the holiday is past. If you enjoyed it that would be a mistake. Or if you love having movies on hand when the Christmas holiday rolls around it would be a mistake not to add this one to it. It entertains and presents an opportunity to introduce the music to children who might not be exposed to it otherwise. And it also gives the entire family a chance to sit and watch an entertaining film together.The themes in the film, the loss of the mother, the effect it has on not just Clara but her father and more will be things a family can use the film to open discussions to with their children. At the same time the various characters will make some laugh and some cry and some learn from. It's a movie that is definitely worth adding to your collection.",The Nutcracker and the Four Realms

30,rgkarim,"This Film Is Nuts On Visuals, But Cracked In Its Story",7,2 November 2018,"The holiday season has begun and with it comes a number of specials and big budget movies to cover the anticipation. Tonight marks the first of a long list of big films to grace the silver screen, with Disney attempting to go strong with a retelling of a legendary, immortal piece of the Nutcracker. Will it be the light hearted, poetic fantasy that the ballet has captivated audiences for years on, or will it be the dark, foreboding tale of war? Robbie K back with a written review to help determine what tale lies in store. Let's get started.Film: The Nutcracker and The Four Realms (2018)Directors:
Lasse Hallström, Joe Johnston
Writers:
Ashleigh Powell (screen story by), Ashleigh Powell(screenplay by)
Stars:
Mackenzie Foy, Keira Knightley, Morgan Freeman
LIKES:Acting: Clara is the center of the Four Realms universe and blows the part out of the water. A model example of the girl power, modern woman role, she has grown much past her cinematic days of Twilight. Graceful, fierce, creative, and more importantly human, Foy played the balanced character well and made the most of the dialogue. Knightley hits her part on the mark as well, using that lighter pitch to bring the sensational sweetness of the fairy in her attempts to capture the hearts of the younger group.The Ballet: Paying tribute to the most famous form of this story, Four Realms makes time to portray the art at the nexus of the four areas. A beautiful display of the dance form, the ballet Misty Copeland's form was splendid to watch as she pirouetted and leaped amidst a wonderful stage that felt much like attending the ballet. For aspiring dancers of this form, this will be the favorite part.The Music: Classic and modern meet together in this wonderful soundtrack, utilizing the theater technology to blast your ears with a symphony of sweetness. All the famous pieces are there for you to enjoy, whether it be the classical Nutcracker Suite to the wonderful balance of the Rat King's theme. Fans of the music should be fulfilled with Disney's use of these tracks and how it supports the visuals.The Visuals: To save room, I'll combine everything together in this like. The Four Realms is gorgeous, a true feast for the eyes at seeing everything come to life in a bountiful display of color, texture, detail, and magic of the world. Settings were dynamic representing high rich culture of the real world, and the whimsical wonder of Clara's own world as each realm utilized a different countries architecture as a basis. Once the world was built, the computer animation came in and cleaned up the designs, bringing smooth transitions, realistic looking creatures, and that same Disney magic we love to be wrapped up in. Finally, the costumes and makeup are stunning themselves, crafting some of the most unique, fun, and curious characters to come out of the Disney woodwork. Expect lots of copying of their designs in future Halloween costumes my friends, because Four Realms deserves big praise and awards for makeup and wardrobe combining into this magical display.DISLIKES:Mice Design Choice: Okay, this is a small dislike, but one nonetheless. The mouse king and his subjects have a creative utilization, and are cute as a button when the field mouse design comes into play (in fact he is the most humorous and adorable part of the film). However, the letdown is that the mice are almost a carbon copy of the ones from Cinderella and quite simplistic compared to the rest of the visuals this movie held. Disney's got the money and the imagination so I would like to see them use it more than this.Under Utilization of Characters: This one is pretty self-explanatory, but after going through the motions to design all the wonderful characters, the studio did a lackluster job of using them. The denizens of the Four Reams disappear in the background, stifling their potential to tell a fantastic story, remain involved in the full movie, and really bring characters that we can grip on to. So while they sine bright in their 15 minutes on screen, there was so much more for them to bring to the table.Story Presentation: The Nutcracker's complex plots and multiple portrayals mean rich lore to dive into and immerse oneself in. Shame that Disney could not deliver on that story in this movie. While geared towards the target audience, Four Realms splendor is skin deep as much of the tale is lost like the fourth realm. Backstories are incomplete, questions are left unanswered, character development is surprisingly weak for most groups, and even worse those characters left out feel even flatter. The major saving grace is Clara whose girl power, dream big princess that will inspire the key demographic, but outside of that, the preachy morals cannot save the skimming and predictability this story focuses on, so can't say I was impressed in this aspect.The Action: No surprise, the action has been diluted for the key demographic in this group. Four Realms battles are really small skirmishes, that are cute, simplistic dances of choreography that lack any real bite to them. While this might be good for younger members, Four Realms needed more suspense to break through the predictability of the film. Some of the battles are also difficult to follow, due to dark settings, odd angles, and the speed of the film.
THE VERDICT:Four Realms continues to prove why Disney reigns high on the imagination train of visual perfection. Costumes, setting, ballet, and characters shine bright in this film, helping to bring one into the realms and root for Clara to succeed. Sadly, the movie's focus on visuals and effects means that the story took hits, with only one story really holding any spark to net my interest. Disney didn't utilize their characters to the full effect, and sort of robbed us of the complete experience that they were going for. Worth a trip for aspiring princesses, ballet artists, and the target audience of girls, but otherwise outside of visuals you can hold off on this one.

Movie Overall: 6..0",The Nutcracker and the Four Realms
31,rannynm,"A Wondrous, Visual Experience",7,9 November 2018,"The Nutcracker and the Four Realms is a wondrous, visual experience that is somewhat light on substance. Apt acting and sensational ballet dancing excel and make this something more memorable than the premise might suggest. Any Disney fans will want to check this out.
The story follows young Clara (Mackenzie Foy) as she recovers from her mother's death. However, a spark of hope lightens Clara after seeing her late mother's parting gift of a box with a hidden key. This key belongs to a parallel world, unlike anything, to which Clara must travel to obtain the key. With the help of budding soldier Phillip (Jayden Fowora-Knight), Clara learns of all obstacles that await, especially in the form of the menacing Mother Ginger (Helen Mirren), leader of the Fourth Realm. Most importantly is a looming war that could preside over the three Realms that are at peace - Land of Snowflakes, Land of Flowers and Land of Sweets and are threatened by the Fourth Realm. In the three Realms resides Sugar Plum (Kiera Knightley) who is on same page as Clara and braves her up for the Fourth Realm as the fate of the Realms and her mother's dying wish relies on it.Mackenzie Foy, as Clara, well presents her character's central struggle to find her inner place amidst all the tragedy, while also being hopeful and cheerful. The end result of this character development is a joy to watch and most definitely the movie's best subplot, amongst all the other slumberous ones. Kiera Knightley, as Sugar Plum Fairy, regales with well-written comedic relief, but the timing of her intervention seems quite random and very over-the-top at times. Regardless, children, most of all, will find enjoyment with all the youthful energy. Jayden Fowora-Knight, as Philip, is my favorite character, despite this being only the second film he has appeared in. His charm and braveness add a relentless vigor to the character that never gets old. Helen Mirren, as Mother Ginger, likewise shines, despite her character suffering from a lack of screen time and character development. With what she is given, she shines with the menacing undertones that could mean good under the entire demeanor. Also, Misty Copeland's cameo is full of entertainment with her ballet proficiency bringing a certain something to the stage without feeling like a forced addition. Instead, it feels more like a celebration of the Nutcracker's roots and remains my favorite scene.Lasse Hallstrom and Joe Johnston expertly direct the visual flair with clear attention to every nook and cranny of the special effects and sound design. Despite this, the movie has flaws coming from the lack of a compelling story line, aside from Clara's inner struggles. Everything feels introduced way too quickly and without clear meaning. This leaves the movie feeling rather inconsequential and just an excuse to put the Nutcracker on the live screen. Still, the movie delivers an amazing awe to each scene's production.The message of the movie is to never lose yourself in sorrow and always connect with your family and friends during times of grief. I give this film 3.5 out of 5 stars and recommend it for ages 6 to 18.Reviewed by Arjun N., KIDS FIRST! Film Critic.

Instead of only being based on the ballet (which, to me, has beautiful dance but lacks narrative) it is a hybrid of the ballet and the book THE NUTCRACKER AND THE MOUSE KING. This is a beautiful, creative, imaginative, skillfull, and layered production. There is the excellence of Misty Copeland as the Ballerina Princess, the ingenue charm of MacKenzie Foy, the veteran performances of Morgan Freeman, Helen Mirren and Keira Knightly, the beautiful set pieces that made the realms so real, the comedic and the menacing elements of story, the real loss of our protagonist and the resolving discoveries (""missing is remembering"" was a powerful thought), wonderful music, and an abundance of imagination and whimsy.

35,rockman182,The Nutcracker and the Four Realms (2018),6,10 November 2018,"Before actually seeing this film, I have to admit that I was hyped for this film. I've liked Disney's live action adaptations, and yes that includes Alice in Wonderland. The film looked like it would carry the form of a very excellent Beauty and the Beast from last year. The film had a good cast, looked grand viscerally, what could go wrong, right? Absolutely everything. This film was a massive disappointment almost from its opening frame. I'm actually surprised at how big of a misfire this was.The film is about a girl named Clara who follows a thieving little mouse to find a magical world that her mother had previously discovered. The world that she discovers has all the wonders you can imagine and consists of pure fantasy. Among the four realms lives someone named Mother Ginger who is apparently trying to bring down the other realms and bring havoc. This is Mackenzie Foy's first lead role and she stars alongside Keira Knightley, Helen Mirren, and Morgan Freeman.The cast can't save this film. its soulless. For all the pretty and wondrous visuals on display (no doubt the film looks amazing), it is completely soulless. Everyone is going through the motions, the plot finds itself being so convoluted, and its just hard to stay invested in anything that's going on. It's a good thing that this film wasn't so long because if it had anymore it would be absolutely miserable. Disney' usually doesn't churn out complete garbage like this, so its kind of shocking.Visually its great, but that's not enough to save this mess. Its a shame for Foy as she could be a future star but this isn't the vehicle to go on. I kind of fear a bit for what's coming because I'm not feeling the live action Aladdin that is coming soon. I heard bad things but I had to check it out and form my own opinion. This thing is so hollow and won't b remembered at all in a few months time.4.5/10",The Nutcracker and the Four Realms
36,RforFilm,"A beautiful look cannot save the boring, lazy, sloppily put together, broken toy that is The Nutcracker and the Four Realms",3,5 November 2018,"With each holiday season, we're reminded of stories like A Christmas Carol, How the Grinch Stole Christmas and even A Visit from St. Nicholas. The story of the Nutcracker is another one often seen. Though originally starting as a novel titled ""The Nutcracker and the Mouse King"", most people remember it as a ballet that was composed by Tchaikovsky. A lot remember either performing in it or having a six year old that performed in it. It has little nostalgia value to me, but I can't deny that the image of the Nutcracker has become synonymous with Christmas. So why haven't there been more adaptations?""The Nutcracker and the Mouse King"" suffers similar problems of other fairy tales in which it contains elements that wouldn't adapt well in a visual format. Much of the ballet, if you were to chose that story, focuses on the dancing, with the plot really taking no more then about fifteen minutes. It's possible that the storytellers at Disney could take the tale and make it something better. The story of ""The Snow Queen"" took several tries before it was made into Frozen. Let's see if Disney can find the magic to make The Nutcracker and the Four Realms a strong toy.During the Victorian era in London, young Clara (played by Mackenzie Foy) is a very smart, clever girl who would rather read and study science then go to parties. Her father insists that she, and her siblings, go to her godfathers Christmas Eve party. Before they go, they all receive late Christmas presents from their late mother Marie. At the party, Clara goes to her godfather Drosselmeyer (played by Morgan Freeman) to open her present, a metal egg with an inscribing ""Everything you need is inside"", but tells her it's a part of her mothers wishes.While searching for her present, she is lead into a mysterious forest where she encounters a nutcracker, Captain Phillip (played by Jayden Fowora-Knight). Upon hearing that she's the daughter of Marie, he takes her to a palace where she discovers is the center of an enchanted kingdom covering four realms. The Sugar Plum Fairy (played by Kira Knightly) thinks that the key to opening Clara's gift is within the grasp of Mother Ginger (played by Helen Mirren). Clara comes to discover that not all is as appears and that she needs to take her mothers place as queen to save everything.The idea of taking The Nutcracker and the Four Realms and turning it into an Alice in Wonderland/Narnia story is not a bad idea. But despite good intentions to modernize it, it falls on it's feet. This is a film equivalent of a gingerbread house; nice to look at, but completely hollow on the inside. To start with, the movie is very pretty to look at (even if it goes overboard with the CGI imagery). When it needs to look magical, it's magical. When it needs to be scary, it can be nightmare inducing. When it needs to look like Christmas, I want to go there.But that's where the film stops for me. My main problem is the story itself, which is not only a copy of the Tim Burton Alice in Wonderland, but offers no morals except to ""BELIEVE IN YOURSELF"". Not only is it incredibly lazy, but in the case of the main character, did she really need that? The opening shows Clara happily operating an invention of her own, but mentions she's too sad for Christmas. Huh...what? The other characters like Mother Ginger, Sugar Plum Fairy, and the Nutcracker simply say the same lesson over.Im sure a lot of parents will still want to take their kids because it's still a good lesson. Let me just say that when I went to the theater, the family filled autitorum contained more silence and people fussing in their seats. I too was fussy as despite being only an hour and a half, it feels too long and drawn out. Pacing is another problem as a lot of it seems more focused on world building then establishing character. Even that fails because it looks so theatrical and plastic, that I can't imagine anything living in this place. You know your Nutcracker is in trouble with when a ballet dance happens, the Sugar Plum Fairy explains the story within the dance rather then letting the intelligence of the audience figure it out.I'll give this three broken nutcrackers out of ten. While it may not be the worst, it's certainly one of the more ""sloppily put together"" movies Disney has put out. I love the Christmas season and hate to see a holiday film wasted on something that's not invested in itself. At this point, your six year olds Nutcracker ballet will be more entertaining then this mess. This sugary mess is a definite skip.",The Nutcracker and the Four Realms

38,MihaiSorinToma,Yet another failed execution of a good idea,6,29 April 2019,"Despite its rather interesting idea, this movie managed to create a plethora of boredom and quite an empty universe, filled with unfinished characters and a pretty unconvincing story. Although it had potential, especially judging by its trailer, it failed to impress in any way, leaving a lot to be desired. Everything seemed flat and underdeveloped, like they thought of a lengthier film but ended up cutting it just to fit an imaginary time frame. I know that it was developed with kids in mind but the story and the action are way too simple. You only get one twist towards the end and that's about it. Everything seems predictable and lame, thus you get little to no satisfaction as problems are solved.There's little to say in terms of upsides. You get a good main actress which transmits a good amount of emotion (most of the time), especially through her British accent, you get a fantastic world which has plenty of unexploited potential but which is well presented and ""drawn"" and you also get an interesting premise. The result is a pleasant atmosphere in which the so called action takes place (I say this because it is very scarce) but overall isn't able to generate enough drama, emotion or even excitement for the movie to be a good watch. It isn't bad either, especially if it were to be seen by a child, but from my point of view, it is a failed execution of an idea which had a lot more inside.",The Nutcracker and the Four Realms

41,bob-the-movie-man,A fantasy that's glossy and beautiful to look at.,6,12 November 2018,"Before the heavyweight juggernaut of ""Mary Poppins Returns"" arrives at Christmas, here's another Disney live action feature to get everyone in the festive spirit.It's Victorian London and Young Clara (Mackenzie Foy) lives with her father (Matthew Macfadyen), her older sister Louise (Ellie Bamber) and her younger brother Fritz (Tom Sweet). It's Christmas and the family are having a hard time as they are grieving the recent death of wife and mother Marie (Anna Madeley). Like her mother, Clara has an astute mind with an engineering bias and is encouraged in this pursuit by her quirky inventor godfather, Drosselmeyer (Morgan Freeman). At his fabled Christmas ball, Clara asks for his help in accessing a gift Clara's mother has bequeathed to her. This leads Clara on a magical adventure to a parallel world with four realms, where everything is not quite peace and harmony.This is a film that visually delights from the word go. The film opens with a swooping tour of Victorian London (who knew the Disney castle was in the capital's suburbs?!) via Westminster bridge and into the Stahlbaum's attic. It's a spectacular tour-de-force of special-effects wizardry and sets up the expectation of what's to come. For every scene that follows is a richly decorated feast for the eyes. Drosselmeyer's party is a glorious event, full of extras, strong on costume design and with a rich colour palette as filmed by Linus Sandgren (""La La Land""). When we are pitched into the Four Realms - no wardrobe required - the magical visions continue.The film represents a Narnia-esque take on the four compass-point lands of Oz, and on that basis it's a bit formulaic. But the good vs evil angles are more subtley portrayed. Of the Four Realms leaders, Keira Knightley as Sugar Plum rather steals the show from the others (played by Richard E. Grant, Eugenio Derbez and Helen Mirren). Mirren in particular is given little to do.What age kids would this be suitable for? Well, probably a good judge would be the Wizard of Oz. If your kids are not completely freaked out by the Wicked Witch of the West and the flying monkeys, then they will probably cope OK with the scary bits of the ""Realm of Entertainment"". Although those who suffer from either musophobia or (especially) coulrophobia might want to give it a miss! All kids are different though, and the ""loss of the mother"" is also an angle to consider: that might worry and upset young children. It is definitely a ""PG"" certificate rather than a ""U"" certificate.Young people who also enjoy ballet (I nearly fell into a sexist trap there!) will also get a kick out of some of the dance sequences, which are ""Fantasia-esque"" in their presentation and feature Misty Copeland, famously the first African American Female Principal Dancer with the American Ballet Theatre. (I have no appreciation at all for ballet, but I'm sure it was brilliant!)As for the moral tone of the film, the female empowerment message is rather ladled on with a trowel, but as it's a good message I have no great problem with that. I am often appalled at how lacking in confidence young people are in their own abilities. Here is a young lady (an engineer!) learning self-resilience and the confidence to be able to do anything in life she puts her mind to. Well said.The story is rather generic - child visits a magical other world - but the screenplay is impressive given its the first-feature screenplay for Ashleigh Powell.The film is credited with two directors. This - particularly if there is also an army of screenwriters - is normally a warning sign on a film. Here, there clearly were issues with the filming since Disney insisted on reshoots for which the original director, Lasse Hallström, was not available. This is where the ""Captain America"" director Joe Johnston stepped in.I really enjoyed Mackenzie Foy's performance as Clara. Now 18, she is a feisty and believable Disney princess for the modern age. (If, like me, you are struggling to place where you've heard her name before, she was the young Murph in Nolan's ""Interstellar""). Another name I was struggling with was Ellie Bamber as her sister. Ellie was excellent in the traumatic role of the daughter in the brilliant ""Nocturnal Animals"", one of my favourite films of 2016. (Hopefully the therapy has worked and Ellie can sleep at night again!).A newcomer with a big role is Jayden Fowora-Knight as the Nutcracker soldier: Jayden had a bit part in ""Ready Player One"" but does a great job here in a substantial role in the film. He stands out as a black actor in a Disney feature: notwithstanding the Finn character in ""Star Wars"", this is a long-overdue and welcome approach from Disney.British comedians Omid Djalili and Jack Whitehouse turn up to add some light relief, but the humour seems rather forced and not particularly fitting.I wasn't expecting to enjoy this one much, but I did. Prinicipally because it is such a visual feast and worth going to see just for that alone: I have a prediction that this film will be nominated for production design, costume design and possible special effects.I think kids of the right age - I would have thought 6 to 10 sort of range - will enjoy this a lot, particularly if they like dance. Young girls in particular will most relate to the lead character. For such kids, I'd rate this a 4*. The rating below reflects my rating as an adult: so I don't think 'drag-a-long' parents in the Christmas holidays (if it is still on by then) will not be totally bored.(For the full graphical review, please check out One Mann's Movies on Facebook).",The Nutcracker and the Four Realms
42,silvermistvio,"Pretty looks like ""Narnia : The Lion, The Witch and The Wardrobe"" film.",5,28 April 2019,"Am I the only one who feels like this film really looks like ""Narnia : The Lion, The Witch and The Wardrobe"" film? The scene where Clara first arrived to that little world, that snowy place really looks like that one where Lucy first arrived to Narnia. That scene really reminded me of that film.The story is also like Narnia film I've mentioned, but difference is that the evil one is hidden. When everything's in place, she appeared. Rather than we know who is evil, hidden is kind of nice. It makes the audience surprised.The acting is basically fine. But I don't like Mackenzie Foy's acting that much. It seems like she needs to be better than this. And (out of topic) I can't quite believe that the little Renesmee from Twilight grew up like this. She's like an adult girl. I was really surprised when I saw her name in the credit. LOL.The animation is good since it's from Disney. So, no doubt. Hence, no more comment on it.I also don't like the title either. The title is like focusing on nutcracker while the whole film is performed by Clara. Still, it really makes it new version. I've only seen nutcracker once in the Barbie film. When I saw it in the film, I was like it's kind of different from it. But I can't say where it becomes different. Yet, it looks great.Finally, the costume. I'd say the costume designer is terrible. What's wrong with Clara's costume? The purple one is the worst. I mean she's the lead, so, at least, they should've done a better job on her dress. But they didn't. So, I really don't like it.Overall is that although it really looks like Narnia film (with no fighting scenes which makes it different from it) and it doesn't have that much thing to enjoy, it's worth to watch at least once.",The Nutcracker and the Four Realms

It may not even make anywhere near its huge Production costs of 120 million $'s judging from the reviews and poor reception .I found it enchanting , reminding me of Pantomimes that I went to see as a child. It's an old fashioned and yet original take on the much loved Christmas Classic of The Nutcracker.At times very humorous bordering on Camp humour , especially when Sugar Plum played by Keira Knightly turns (I was glad as she was irritating me a little being so sweet)
Helen Mirren gives a delightful performance as Mother Ginger and Mackenzie Foy is delightful as Clara.
I thought they should have used more of the talent and humour of Jack Whitehall as Harlequin and Omid Djalili as Cavalier they had some of the funniest moments in a film that does have a few slow spots in the first half but they're needed to set the plot.Lasse Halstrom directed Chocolat, on of my favourite movies and I can see similarities in this film , go with an open mind you may enjoy it.Great music and 3G scenery not a classic like The Wizard of Oz but some of the same old fashioned magic. I thought it far superior to Fantastic Creatures and the Crimes of Grindelwald also showing at the moment and getting a much better reception , it's all a matter of personal taste and I imagine all at Disney are hoping for a huge hit and better reception for Mary Poppins Returns,I don't think they need to worry.",The Nutcracker and the Four Realms

We all new this movie wouldn't be good but I love The Nutcracker so I wanted to see it. This movie wasn't really good but it wasn't really bad. It didn't have much to do with the Nutcracker story so I was a bit disappointed. The story was kind of interesting at the beginning but then it just all fell apart. It was also so predictable. I will say Mackenzie Foy, like always, did a good job playing Clara. I also liked Morgan Freeman for the 5 minutes he was in it. Everyone else was annoying or didn't stand out. By far the worst part of the movie was Keira Knightley as Sugar Plum. She is such a great actress and all of that went away in this. She had the most annoying fricken voice and didn't really seem to get into her role. There were some good things about it, other than Mackenzie Foy. The production design was really good. There was one scene with a ballet and that was the best part. The production was really cool. The costumes were pretty good too. The score was good for the songs from The Nutcracker but the rest was just meh. There's not much to say about it.

53,jamiedarlow-37510,Pretty enjoyable and magical!,6,20 February 2020,"From Disney based on the story and ballet of the same name (minus the four realms!) it follows Clara (Mackenzie Foy) who is lost and perplexed following the passing of her mother. Her Christmas gift from her mother this year is a beautiful egg that seems to be holding a secret inside. Through the help of her godfather (Morgan Freeman) she is shown the right path to discovering the secret and transported into the world of the four realms. Visually it is quite lovely; beautiful colours and fun costumes aplenty from designer Jenny Beavan (Mad Max: Fury Road, Roald Dahl's Esio Trot). It's a really Christmassy film which I loved about it and just made for a really relaxed and warm watch. Co-directed by Lasse Hallstrom (Chocolat) and Joe Johnston (Jumanji, Jurassic Park III) it's actually a pretty well held together narrative considering two directors who usually work alone have come together for it which is impressive! The first half of the film in particular has moments that are truly magical that you can get swept away in; including a wonderful dance sequence with ballerina Misty Copeland. The last half does go very much into Narnia/Alice In Wonderland action territory but manages to do it in a way that I think doesn't take itself too seriously. Performance wise everyone is good and there are great appearances from Richard E Grant, Helen Mirren and two particular English comedians! The strangest performance is Keira Knightley's as the Sugar Plum Fairy. I still can't quite tell if I liked it or found it a bit cringeworthy which is an odd combination; nothing against her at all as she is a fantastic actress! But it did remind me a bit of Reese Witherspoon's whimsical performance in A Wrinkle In Time which is not a good thing.

It's a shame, because the director has made some really great stuff. (Captain America: The First Avenger, and 1995's ""Jumanji"".). The main issue was the plot. The plot was all over the place. I remember very little about it. It was a muddled mess of a movie. The acting was way over the top. Keira Knightly usually does so well, but, sadly she is the worst one here. Every single line is over enunciated or overacted. I think doing all those Pirates movies with Johnny Depp rubbed off on her, because it's like watching a female Johnny Depp. The film, rather than telling the story of the Nutcracker, which is a fine story, and if they had stuck with the original story it probably would have been fine, decides to tell a completely different story, that is very, very, loosely tied to the story. I think the only thing it shares with the original story is the title. It was trying to imitate too many other fantasy movies. Wizard of Oz, 2010's Alice in Wonderland, Narnia. It spent too much time trying to distract with flashy visuals, when it should have been focusing on the story and acting, and it suffers greatly for it. This movie has no audience. Kids won't like it, because the scary visuals will scare them, and adults will find it boring. This movie is probably the closest thing to being on acid that I will ever experience. Skip this one. See if a local theatre is doing a production of the original ""Nutcracker"" instead.

56,ayoreinf,"E.T.A Hoffmann meets Disney's era of TTT, and comes out fairly well",8,7 November 2018,"To be sure, The Nutcrucker and the Mouse King, is a different story. Its villains are straightforward villains, its heroes seem simpler, but like the more famous Danish fairytale author extraordinaire, H. C. Andersen, his artistic fairytales have deeper layers which Disney wouldn't reach, ever. Disney, doesn't stand for hidden depth. It stands for good story telling, good characters, and great artistic design. And we sure get it all in this version of the Nutcrucker. And ever since Enchanted, Disney also stands for what I call TTT - Turned Tables Trend - of Disney's movies, where Disney's grandees decided that in order to join the modern age they must add some sort of a plot twist to their movies. And they did it so relentlessly that I consider it a surprise when they tell a story where the villain is really the actual villain and when the hero's road to victory is straightforward.As I said it here beforehand this became so ridiculous, that certain movies ended being plainly stupid (Into the Wood), but sometimes they do get their story all right, and then all their strengthes combine well into a charming story. In my book, this one such case. What we got here is a charming fantasy, with the recently required strong female character, that seems to extract some special hate on this site, and I can't understand why. Again, I already said it here, but I realize I must say it again: this is a commercial trend, but the entire movie business is commercial, and other commercial trends didn't get such quantities of passionate hatred.One last remark, In my personal book, I've never seen Keira Knightley doing a better job.

Granted, predictability isn't a terrible flaw of a Disney film, or even a PG film, but at times it does seem like the cliches are coupled with a lack of conviction. Plot wise, the stakes aren't that high: the Nutcracker kingdom doesn't need that much saving, and also the forces that could take over the four realms aren't that terrible or even powerful, so the whole story is so unchallenging that no one really had to try--the viewers or the actors both. And in some scenes, this lack of impetus is really felt. Child actress Mackenzie Foy casually defends herself against the tin soldier's swords, Hellen Mirren barely struggles when she is seized, Keira Knightley hardly reacts in a critical action moment. So really, there's not enough action, either physical or psychological, to fuel the story or engage the viewers.This being said, there is quite a dramatic premise that could have made for a promising children's film, that is, how to process the death of a parent. The metaphor of the tin men (they are hollow, and therefore destructive) and the anger they represent in the hands of Sugar Plum, who is very obviously a stand-in for the grieving Clara, is rather poetic, actually. You get the feeling there are some really good bones to this story, but it's almost like much that was serious was overcorrected to the point of becoming hollow as well. ""The Nutcracker"" should've been a much better movie.The actors mentioned (Mirren, MacFadyen, Freeman) are sort of like remnants of the better film that wasn't created. Their roles are small and almost tertiary rather than secondary. It's odd how little impact their characters have for actors as capable as they are. Very much missed opportunities.Mackenzie Foy as Clara is fine, and I think she almost has it at times.Keira Knightley is the best part about ""The Nutcracker,"" I think, in a role that is very much unlike her. She brings a sense of fun and wickedness to the film. I like what she did with her voice. I rather think she deserved more screen time.I did find some aspects of ""The Nutcracker"" annoyed me out of proportion, but anyway, instead of nitpicking I will say ""The Nutcracker"" is a good effort and generally pleasant, although vastly watered down to the point of being eye-rollingly inoffensive. Some darker elements sort of peak through, though, and some intelligent metaphorical devices (the tin men, the ""monster"" made of mice) save ""The Nutcracker"" from being completely generic. Because some of the message of the film did land for me, despite the thick fog of Disney ""inspirational"" platitudes, I will give ""The Nutcracker"" a 7/10 instead of a 6. Clara and her journey does offer some insight to the nature of grief and how to keep a family together despite trauma.",The Nutcracker and the Four Realms

And the movie goes one, never really getting any type of excitment out of you.I will just put some observations I had here, and finish it, I think what I already said sums up it very well.Do they believe she's the princess just cause she says so?She definitely handled the whole royalty thing inexplicably well.The CGI is not good.There is a FIVE MINUTES dance sequence that goes basically nowhere, showing nothing relevant at all.The soundtrack is just blend and generic.Man, the performances are not good. I can't blame the actors here, cause there are a lot of good actors here, but still. Keira Knightley steals the scene tho, her performance is insanely bad, she is so over the top and seems like she is reading her lines from the paper throught the whole movie.Well, at the end, it seems just like a generic, uncharismatic version of Alice. If you want to see a fantastic adventure, with magical creatures and strange worlds, just go see both of Alice's films that have recently come out, it's way better.",The Nutcracker and the Four Realms

73,Fudge-3,Reasonably good fantasy for Christmas,7,19 November 2018,"Nice fantasy story for Christmas even though the release date was a bit early. Well staged with good music with a few nods to its ballet ancestry. The production, acting and CGI are all pretty good while the costume and scenery was great. I'd have enjoyed more dance.I've not seen the ballet but this is a different story anyway. Three children, who've recently lost their mother, are taken to a Christmas ball. Each child there follows a string that leads them to their gift. Clara's string leads her instead into a magical land. Imagine a very gentle cross been, 'The Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe,' with, 'The Hobbit,' and you'll get the idea. I call it a drama rather than an adventure but it's good escapism and there is some humour.There are a couple a sequences that will bore young minds where things get explained that don't need to be explained. Beautifully shot passages of the princess' tour of the fantasy realms get squeezed into an exposition about its history. The editor should have been more brutal and left it out for the forthcoming DVD's uncut version. Even so; the story telling soon gets back on track.I enjoyed the mouse, Mackenzie Foy plays the flawed heroine Clara, Helen Mirren gives us a powerful Mother Ginger while Keira Knightley, in danger of over-exposure, does an excellent sugar plum fairy.There is some mild threat but it is safe for most children.",The Nutcracker and the Four Realms

Watching the Nutcracker years ago when I was younger, I kind of understand the story is the certain way, although this film feels more of a sequel than a remake of the Nutcracker since the story is based on the mouse king.Looking at reviews most of judge=ing this as a great film because of it costume design, which yes I will admit the costume design and set-piece are well done, but what people don't seem to understand material things don't make a film as a whole great.Don't get me wrong Mackenzie Foy beautiful actress, her performance carries the film I would go as far as to say solid acting with what she was given, Matthew Macfadyen done great for his role as well as Morgan Freeman.With set piece and costume design does bring this film out in Disney style film, but this film was heavily flawed and cringe-worthy for a nutcracker film.Dislikes: WOW this film seriously sucks, I don't mean this in a nasty way, I mean this is a seriously bad written film that completely lost the identity of the Nutcracker, not to meantion the very adventure of the Nutcracker.Where was the flair and adventure the Nutcracker story has the sense of danger, im sorry but this felt like an on-screen Stage show you would see at the Stage Theatre in some Parody of itself, with a bunch of tired Disney cliches and bad casting and no to mention force diversity from someone that cant acted im sorry but Jayden Fowora-Knight acting felt so forced in this film it didn't feel natural like his been acting for a long timeDon't get me started on the casting Jack Whitehall for this film, was his scene meant to be funny, because they were, I found myself shaking my head at these scene with the cringe on just how bad casting this was. The weak plot line twist of a villian not being who you would think it was it's so cringe-worthy it was unreal, it's like the film was trying to be three things.It's like the film was trying to be a style of Narina with an epic story yet fall completely on its faces, with a ballerina stage style film while trying to be a film, these two things don't work, your iver trying to be the film or a Stage Theatre Parody with stupid jokes.Im being honest this is the worst Disney adaption they've done, Maleficent and Beauty and the beast disney Adaptions were good, this film sorry is the worst disney film ive ever had to sit through, it completes lost it identity lost its epic and heroic adventure with some of the worst acting for a few actors.Not a film for Adult nor is it the Nutcracker we all know, it's just a shame because Mackenzie Foy was the only thing perfect in character writing in such a badly written film.Overall: Not the Nutcracker with a cringe-worthy acting and lose of idenity, worst lazy written film from disney that I feel will flop with a weak plot",The Nutcracker and the Four Realms

For me, still the perfect story and cinematography is Narnia series, but here we can also entertain ourselves by the imagination of each character, especially the new coming Hollywood idol Mackenzie Foy and the previous idol, Keira Knightley. Nutracker story is coming from imagination of a child that lost her mother and jump into adventure in other world, just like Narnia, Alice in Wonderland, Sophie's World, and Wizard of Oz. Thank you to the Editorial and Animator team that entertain our eyes since the beginning. You know, having such a good animation is so hard in my country, because perhaps it lacks some technologies. But here, Disney team can create a very good movie for everybody. Still they have some philosophical explanation for some symbols. Four realms can represent four continent and which continent is the most greediest among others. Here also we can see black male character not just white heroes.

Only the protagonists - Clara and the Nutcracker - are the same, but the rest of the plot is totally invented by Disney, with the intention to create something new and different.
The result is nice but not so good, despite the presence of wellknown actors such as Keira Knightley and Morgan Freeman. Wonderful the scenes and locations, however what is lacking is the plot, easy and banal in several points, full of commonplaces.

Fast forward to THIS movie, I saw the ad's, they gave me deja vus about the earlier movie, but we gave it a try because we go and see The Nutcracker every couple of years and even if my husband doesn't like ballet, he gets the story and likes the music. Do NOT go and see this if you even vaguely like the classic Christmas Nutcracker ballet, I doubt you will enjoy this strange adaptation.Yes, it is chock full of famous names, just like A Wrinkle in Time was, but that doesn't make it good. Mackenzie Foy is the stand out here, but she cannot save this. It will not be a classic Christmas movie to watch every year, my daughter said she won't even watch it for free on Netflix.The saving grace from my daughter (10 years old) was that it wasn't as long as some movies are, but she would gladly have walked out about an hour in because she wasn't enjoying it at all.I would honestly not recommend anyone to go see this, it takes a classic story that many people love and tries to make it into something it isn't.I gave it 1/10 because no one in our group liked it at all - thankfully Disney does have some great movies coming soon (Ralph Breaks The Internet, etc).If you are a parent, make sure you go to the cheap day showing at your local AMC (Tuesday usually), or to an early showing where you don't have to pay full price.I'm not sure what the people who gave it 10/10 were watching, but I can hardly think it was this movie.",The Nutcracker and the Four Realms

Morgan Freeman, Mother Ginger (Helen Mirren) is a joke, Cavalier (Omid Djalili) and Harlequin (Jack Whitehall) are really annoying, the SugarPlum is irritating, Shiver doesn't do much and Clara's family are kind of unlikable yup, so is the acting, it's super dull and not very memorable, the only one who is actually good is Mackenzie Foy, she does try and for the most part I think she is good, she's a lovely looking actress, she can do a good British accent and she does try and does succeed, everyone else I feel sorry for, these people are really damn good, Morgan Freeman, Helen Mirren, Keira Knightly, Richard E. Grant, Jack Whitehall, Omid Djalili, come on guys..... you are better then this, all of their performances are really just them playing themselves and it's really sad and hard to watch, not only are the characters super dull and not all that memorable, but most of the performances are really not that memorable and are just a joke.So yeah... this movie is not only a awful movie, but this is easily the worst Disney Live-Action movie..... yes even worse .. but we don't talk about that, lazy writing with a predicable plot, visually dull and cheap looking Effects, characters that are forgettable and dull stereotypes, with bad acting, granted the visuals can look nice at times, Mackenzie Foy is the only one putting on a good performance and Jame-Newton Howard's score is a delight, but that's not enough to save this train-wreck of a movie, I'm not exaggerating when I say it's one of the worst movies of the year and one of the worst movies of all time...... yes I just said that......, I don't recommend this movie at all, sure kids might enjoy it, but I barley got any joy at all, and even the screening I went to with not many people, I didn't hear any laughs or enjoyment from them, it's THAT bad..., so yeah avoid this at all times, if you want a good kids/family Goosebumps 2 and Smallfoot are worth a watch..... or wait till the Grinch comes out.I'm going to give this garbage of a film 1.2/10.",The Nutcracker and the Four Realms

90,Tug-3,Deserves a (slightly) better reputation,5,12 December 2020,"Several films have tried to translate ""The Nutcracker"" to the big screen, some as straightforward adaptations of the ballet and others as interpretations of the original book by E. T. A. Hoffman. The original text is dense, dark, and does not lend itself to a straight cinematic retelling. The ballet, meanwhile, uses only the scaffolding of Hoffman's plot, usually dispensing with the narrative by the end of the first act and bringing out a series of showpieces in the second. As a result, it too is not a prime candidate for a scripted interpretation. Still, it's such a beloved Christmas staple that the lure to adapt it has proven irresistible.Of the retellings I've seen, ""The Nutcracker and the Four Realms"" is the best, but I say that cautiously. As with the ballet, it uses only the base elements of the original book, mingling in some elements of the ballet, although with some interesting subversions. (Kids who love the ballet will be excited at the presence of the Sugarplum Fairy and Mother Ginger, but to see them at war is certainly unexpected.) However, if the writers discarded the character names and the Christmas Eve party that bookends the film, you could easily take this for another Narnia or Alice in Wonderland sequel. The plot elements line up so closely with Tim Burton's Alice in Wonderland that it's hard not to see the Sugarplum Fairy as a spin on Helena Bonham Carter's Red Queen. The story becomes more depressingly derivative as it progresses, so by the time the villain's Grand Scheme is revealed and two sides go to war, you sigh in resignation and strap in for the upcoming CGI-fest.Still, this movie has some terrific qualities. All the acting is strong and sincere. I like Morgan Freeman as an avuncular, rather than terrifying, Drosselmeyer. Keira Knightley is gleeful and she lights up every scene she's in. Mackenzie Foy is a steady, likeable presence in a movie where she's on screen for at least 90 percent of the running time. Additionally, the sets, costumes, and CGI are well-done. You can tell a lot of thought went into making this film, especially in little background touches. The Christmas Party scenes are particularly well done, making clear why visiting Drosselmeyer's would be a thrill for a child.James Newton Howard deserves acclaim for his soundtrack. It's no easy task to adapt one of the world's best-known classical ballet scores, at least not without seeming disrespectful. (If you want an example, check out the atrocious Nutcracker 3-D from 2010.) The music fits in seamlessly, especially when at one point the score dips in and out of an actual ballet, focusing on dancers and then on the fairy-land audience.",The Nutcracker and the Four Realms
91,Tigerbai1,Drama Fantasy Adventure,7,21 August 2019,"I would rate this PG due to fighting scenes. This film with its all-star cast is not your typical happy Christmas movie but a drama fantasy adventure - coming of age. It deals with things like legacy, bravery, confidence and biblical conviction and grieving. Clara pursues the key to open her mother's gift and to find the meaning of her note. As in the real-world truth can be elusive not because its hiding, but because lies and falsehood are vying for credence at every turn and distract us if we are not careful.Clara nearly gives in to doubt and discouragement but remembers her mother's parting note - the four realms adventure helps her realize her mother's legacy. Her mom was telling her she had within her the Holy Spirit and the things they had already taught her - all she needed to face the world and the be the person she's meant to be. Though God is never mentioned in the movie similar to the Chronicles of Narnia and the book of Esther the influence of God is implied. You can only miss the true message if you desire to. Its easy to spin things to your own evil purposes like the media and sales people do to get people to buy what they don't need and watch made-up sensationalized news shows otherwise no one would watch and their ratings would go down because truth is often boring and downright hard to swallow like medicine.The film is essentially asking us all - how will you choose to live? What legacy will you leave your children. We all have a sphere of influence for good or bad. Will you throw your kids to the wolves to influence for selfish lazy & false motives or teach them absolute truth against which there is no law. To live life their way or God's way. Evil would like objective truth to fade from existence, but it never shall as shown in this fantasy film. We are shown how circumstances and surroundings are out of our control while we are growing up. Spoiler alert: Sugar plum is the turn coat -- seemingly innocent and kind and asking Clara for help, but when opportunity knocks, she seizes the opportunity to overthrow the other 3 realms. Earlier in the film she complains of the so-called dangerous and rebellious Ginger Mother who in reality was the only realm who knew who posed the true danger. As in real life danger can come in all kinds of packages with fine sounding arguments. Their ignorance and inability to discern the truth almost cost everyone their freedom. We see how important it is to protect our young and show them the correct path and not leave to society or their teachers to learn morals and ethics. It is the parent's responsibility before a righteous God. Why would anyone trust our precious children to strangers on how to live and what to believe? The prophets of old lost their lives to bring the biblical message to all mankind. Evil rarely looks evil on the outside, but is insidious striking when we are most vulnerable, and at our weaknesses. Sugar Plum could have also chosen good, but had given her heart over to darkness and despite the truth offered her could not accept it when the moment of truth came and she as the move portrayed suffered the consequences for her actions -- which is as it should be. Good offered her a chance (as it always does) to change and she would not.Clara gradually gains an understanding of who she is enabling her to fulfil her unforeseen role --reminiscent of what life does to all of us. The film draws you into her character and somehow your own story as you watch it. Clara must overcome her doubts and anxiety and trust her God given gifts and strength by faith. It's wonderful how they tie in reliance on friends and trust and loyalty. This film does a great job of dealing with grief and how it can keep us off balance if we don't remember who we are in Christ and what our parents taught us - the implication being good biblical character since we are in the Christmas genre. It brings out how difficult and disorienting death can be in a family and how we must be patient and understanding while helping other family members cope with the loss as well. It depicts clearly how working together & fighting for right is good and worth the effort in the end when our cause is just though the way may be hard to discern and navigate. It's the old adage 'evil prospers when good people do nothing'. God forces us to face life head on and to ask the hard questions and seek for answers until we find them. We ignore God (truth) to our own demise as depicted in the film.Finally recognizing her mother's desire was for her to embrace life to the fullest Clara realizes that means making tough choices and fighting for right. Sometimes a peaceful solution is not on the table. And that she is free to remember the past while always striving forward to be the person God made her to be. She doesn't allow herself to be paralyzed by grief, evil, and the complexities of life. She sees her mother's legacy of mercy, unconditional love, patience, loyalty, kindness, bravery, duty, and family. Spoiler alert: toward the end Clara realizes she had misjudged her father. He simply grieved differently at the loss of his wife (her mother) than she did. Not less, just differently. This is a splendid adventure with a moving theme for all ages. It forces the viewer to think which is why I recommend this one whether you've experienced a death in the family or not. Enjoy! Some may ask why the 7 rating with such positive comments, but when you've seen thousands of movies you realize everyone sees things differently and you must leave room for the 8s 9s and 10s.",The Nutcracker and the Four Realms
92,harshada_shewale,Very few plus points,5,2 November 2018,"The only plus points are:
1. Visually extravagant sets and beautiful locales
2. Casting of Clara was perfect
3. The musicEverything else is terrible.
1. Most of the actors have given robotic, fake performances. Keira Knightly is the absolute worst - fake, pretenscious arrogance. The cast, though reputed, wasn't given enough bandwidth.
2. The story. Absolute terrible story, why can't you just stick to the original Mouse King story? Where was the Mouse King? I kept waiting and waiting.. Moreover the story is far too simplistic.
3. Terrible direction and script. Boring, mundane dialogues not worthy of Disney.
4. Felt like a repeat of Alice in Wonderland and Wizard of Oz with a dark setting.OH Disney! The other live action remakes were so good! Why did you mess up the Nutcracker story? It's such a beautiful one!",The Nutcracker and the Four Realms
93,bonniejoy-978-68763,Alice in Wonderland meets Nutcracker,5,12 February 2019,"Well after seeing Nazis in Fantasy - I mean Nutcracker Untold Story I decided to go ahead and watch Narnia meets Alice in Wonderland meets Wizard of Oz meets The Nutcracker - I mean Nutcracker and the Four Realms. Part of why I wanted to watch Nutcracker Untold Story was because I knew it was the worst version of the Nutcracker story period and knew that Disney would have a lot more effort. And for the most part I was right. In comparison, the story's a bit better (no Nazis or terrifying imagery), it feels more fairytale like as it should be, and about 75% of the time the music placement works. And I find the actors to be really good - come on, you can't go wrong with Morgan Freeman and admittedly, it's hilarious to see Kiera Knightly as the overly sweetly perky sugar plum fairy. I also like that there's a few ballet moments (again being a fan of the original ballet) and even has a brief wink at Fantasia. There's even a ballet performance for the end credits and it's a treat to watch. I also like the idea that Clara's mother's name was Marie and she went to the realms before. What the ballet usually forgets is that the main character's real name wasn't Clara, but Marie. So does this make this a sequel to the original story? Yep, this is a sequel to the Nutcracker story. As a side note, it's nice to see Richard E. Grant redeem himself in this after doing Nutcracker 3D.So what doesn't really work? This basically is a checklist of Disney cliches that aren't that interesting. For instance, taking a bright and colorful story and turning it into an all out war. Tim Burton did that with Alice in Wonderland and while it's still a guilty pleasure, it didn't work well because everyone was mad with no sense. It doesn't work for Nutcracker because a majority of it was bright, delightful, and dancing sugar plums. Yes there was a war between the rats and toy soldiers, but it wasn't this intense. The twist villain. Whether before or after Frozen, many of us have grown tired of these twist villains, and I certainly have. While it can work like in Coco, it has become a tired and uninteresting last minute cliche. It didn't work well in Maleficent, Incredibles 2, or this. On top of that, the motivation doesn't make sense. Also, it is the same tired story: the chosen hero foretold comes to stop a force of evil, when temporarily defeated goes about moping and doping, when you know she's going to rise back up and win.So I don't think it's bad. The plot, if I think about it hard enough is irritating, but visually it's pleasant and enjoyable. Definitely a lot better than Nutcracker 3D, but could have been so much better. If they got rid of the ""war"" plot, this could have been so much better and have some originality to it. However, for what we got, I liked it okay (so happy to see some ballet in it as well as hear the music). So I would have to give this a C+. If you like it, great I like a few things about it too",The Nutcracker and the Four Realms

They filled the screen with intriguing scenes and glorious landscapes. The baddie was childishly bad, not ""out to conquer the world"" but she did bad things not to the point of murder; there's more to evil than murder, there's power grabbing without thinking of consequences.

96,mirkobozic,Cotton candy feminism,3,10 November 2018,"Even people who never even heard of Tschaikovsky know about the Nutcracker. The same goes for people who never attend ballet performances. In short, the Nutcracker is the theatre equivalent of the Home Alone movies for the holiday season-a standard, albeit a kitschy one. But then again, kitsch goes with Christmas just as good as wine with good cheese. And yes, cheesy is one of numerous adjectives that come to mind when I think about this lates product of Lasse Halstrom's imagination. How can someone who produced masterpiece fairytales like ""Chocolat"" come up with something like this? It made me feel that the camera tape was made of cotton candy. Essentially, it's the ""four realms"" where things went terribly wrong. Instead of providing us with simple narrative, mountains of gingerbread and a touching sountrack (it's a Christmas ballet, not Star Wars), Hallstrom decides to introduce us to Clara, the main protagonist who happens to be a clever, innovative pre-feminist heroine stuck in Victorian patriarchy. She finds out her mother used to be a queen of a magical world that since turned into a rainbow-coloured chaos where Helen Mirren is dressed to kill in a castle shaped like a huge doll.Clara almost flaunts her antisocial behaviour and wants us to think she's cool because she's not obsessing about things that are ""expected from us"". Her family's overblown grief about her deceased mother and her absence at the big Christmas tree pushed it over the edge for me, but you stick with it because it really does look like a perfect holiday with big decorated trees, dolls, warm fireplaces, presents and cakes. There is this annoying trend in Disney where every female lead in the classic fairytales suddenly turns into a witty, pseudo-feminist who's about to save the world, or at least, herself. It's almost isulting how they twist and turn traditional narratives where women only ever aspire to be wives or mothers instead of inventors or Hillary Clinton. In other words, in the imagination of the Brothers Grimm, to paraphrase Clinton, they gladly stay at home and bake cookies. And desperately need men to break the curse and save them, while the villains mostly are-what a surprise- other women. Similarly to ""Alice in Wonderland"", Hallstrom's movie fails because it insists on a nonexistent stereotype in the original context of the source material. It's only because we're in Victorian London that Clara isn't a black vegan lesbian, to tick all the boxes of feminist political correctness. So I'd suggest you stick with the ballet, as it has more grace and the exact amount of cotton candy to make it digestible.",The Nutcracker and the Four Realms

The story of gallant nutcracker fighting to protect the damsel who, in her own right, participates actively in the struggle against the evil mouse king, gets a ""twist"" that is utterly predictable. When you first see the CGI mouse, with his anthropomorphic behaviorism, one thing can be quite certain... nobody will be throwing any shoes at it. From there only the most simple of children will have trouble connecting the dots to figure out who is evil and who is good.The road to get to the ""gotcha"" moment, however, will remain long and tedious, cluttered with meaningless dialogue between characters who were shot in such a way to maximize the edit potential by rarely having them on screen together. Then there is an odd hodge podge of effects, from costumes that look like they were put together out of junk found in an attic, to soul less CGI that simply makes no sense.As a journey of discovery, it literally steals it's ideas from the Chronicles of Narnia as well as Hugo. There is minimal romance. The heroine is sufficiently plastic to allow her to speak completely in platitudes, and to be totally forgettable. The villian is one-dimensional, and by the end of the movie we have to just wonder whether Disney is capable of telling engaging stories or merely has to rely on the rent earning potential of ""famous"" stuff... like the Nutcracker, which, after this venture, most certainly remains a tale best told sans Disney.",The Nutcracker and the Four Realms

109,OlgaGorelik,"Imaginative, beautiful, touching, and very well acted",8,11 November 2018,"When your child talks about wanting to see a movie for months before it opens, sometimes it's a good thing. If it weren't for my 10yo son's insistence that we see The Nutcracker and the Four Realms on its opening weekend, I might have gotten spooked by bad reviews. I found the movie quite delightful - imaginative, beautiful, touching. I liked how the elements of the ballet were incorporated into the film. From Misty Copeland's magnificent dancing to parts of the familiar music numbers blended seamlessly with the modern original score, which is great in its own right. Even the architecture of the palace pays homage to the ballet's Russian origin. And what a great way to introduce kids to ballet!
I took my son to see the The Nutcracker on stage when he was about 7. The second act was when he got fidgety and disruptive. The film took that very part and turned it into a story filled with action and complex characters. It put the story somewhat on its head, yet it is surprisingly logical - within its fantasy realm, no pun intended. Veteran actors took their three dimensional characters and ran with them - barely recognizable Helen Mirren as Mother Ginger, Matthew Macfadyen as the grieving father, Kiera Nightly as Sugarplum Fairy. With the latter though I had a problem when her reactions became bizarrely sexual. Not because it's inappropriate for a kids movie, but because it just felt wrong. But everything ultimately hinges on the young Mackenzie Foy, who is just perfect as ingenious Clara. And Jayden Fowora-Knight is revelation as The Nutcracker - so wonderfully charming and effortlessly alive. There's an actual chemistry between these two that made me almost wish for some romance.
I could have done without the two doofus soldiers used for mandatory comic relief, although the scene that makes fun of customs forms was dead on. I am also getting a little fed up with Disney's insistence on pushing STEM girl role models, but that might just be me having seen too much of Doc McStuffings and Stuck in the Middle on their TV channels. I found Clara totally believable as science minded inventor, but every time snowflakes would land on her bare arms without causing so much as a goose bump, the movie would lose a little something.

Yeah the story is definitely cliched but compared to what Disney will come out with the following year (minus MCU), it's actually really good and manages to be faithful to the original story. The main character is better written than Alice, it has better visuals and color scheme, and the music was the best thing about the movie.My only complaints would be that Sugar Plum isn't well-written as she's the twist villain, but even then her reasons for doing so aren't explained that well and could have been more fleshed out. Another thing that could have been fleshed out more was Clara's Mother. We don't know how she created the world in which the realms subside in (and despite the fact that we know that she made a machine that turns toys into real people); and her relationship with Clara isn't shown at all, which doesn't really help us to connect with the main character.In another situation, I would have given the film 6 stars.But seeing all the other terrible stuff that Disney has been churning out since 2019 (and now 2020 with Artemis Fowl), I'm adding one more star since this feels refreshing in comparison.",The Nutcracker and the Four Realms

Or if in Star Wars they suddenly revealed that Darth Vader and the Empire were the good guys and Yoda and the Jedi were evil. This time they made the Mouse King good and Sugar Plum evil. Please, Disney, just stop, it isn't working.Overall, the movie was ok and worth a watch, but it felt like they dropped the ball in several areas, most especially the twist of revealing who the true villain was.

She actually does do a good job playing her, I will admit, and while this isn't one of her best, it is a lot better than the Twilight movie she was in(Lol)!And the only character I found annoying in this movie was Keira Knightley's character. She has an annoying high pitched voice and she is a boring villain. Every other character except for Clara, like I said is very boring. The nutcracker had no character as well!
Overall, I didn't hate this movie, I just wish the characters had more personality and was more nutcracker-like and had more story to it, and I will say it did have a few good moments in it.
If you have kids and they wanna see it during Christmas, they may enjoy it and it is out on Netflix, where I watched it not around Christmas time.

123,PradoCedric,A bloated and fractured fantasy misfire and mess with beautiful yet flat qualities,1,1 November 2018,"Honestly, where to start with this beautiful travesty? Despite boasting a stellar talent and cast with the likes of Helen Mirren, Keira Knightley, and Morgan Freeman, this cinematic endeavor turns out to be an unholy and misguided collaboration, and points to everything wrong about this terrible and miscalculated adaptation.First, the tone and the quality is clearly a rip-off to the other fantasy films that preceded it, such as the 2010 version of Alice in Wonderland, The Chronicles of Narnia, and The Wizard of Oz. The script is totally cliched, muddled, confusing, and convoluted, given the fact that the screenwriter of this film who is just a first-time inexperienced screenwriter, has no idea on how to blend well fantasy with other genres such as drama and adventure. Also, this film has major inconsistencies within the plot and are incoherent. Even the additional writing of Tom McCarthy is giving no redeemable favors. Even the dialogue is bland, boring, and flat. Much of the character development is also non-existent, and the characters itself are half-baked and dreadfully written. Another issue that this film have is the cheesy and campy tone that almost draws negative similarities with bad movies that have these similar qualities such as Batman & Robin, and 2003 adaptation of The Cat in the Hat.Second, the acting is totally flat and atrocious. Despite Mackenzie Foy's very considerable effort in bringing depth to her performance, it simply resembled as uninspiring, flat, boring, and mediocre. Morgan Freeman and Helen Mirren have given a flat and terribly phoned-it-in performances, which is a major disappointment considering the two acting legends are one of the most exceptional and versatile acting talents in the acting business, and their performances are simply nothing but paycheck roles. Even Keira Knightley's performance is far from being terribly wasted, it's simply the worst. From the terribly yet laughable and cartoonish voice, monotone, and mannerisms that draws unfavorable comparisons to Helena Bonham Carter's whimsical style, this type of acting style does not work on Kiera Knightley's filmography and she's better off on handling roles of usual dramatic leading ladies of literature. Even the performances of Matthew Macfadyen, Misty Copeland, Eugenio Derbez and Richard E. Grant are simply useless and wasted.Third, despite its stellar yet remarkable costumes, the production design, and the musical score; these aren't enough to redeem this fantasy misfire. It's just style over substance. Even the green screen within the film is terribly noticeable and the CGI is distracting. Worse, the film is hollow, bloated, flat, and soulless. It lacks the magic, charm, heart, and soul that the other superior Disney live-action fantasy films such as Into the Woods, Cinderella, Beauty and the Beast, The Jungle Book, Pete's Dragon and Christopher Robin, possesses. Even Alice in Wonderland and Maleficent which had a weak story, still had the same characteristics and are at least guilty-pleasure and redeemable. This film on the other hand is irredeemable from start to finish. It gets points for diversity but just like the ill-fated A Wrinkle in Time, much of its great ambition just falls flat and is arguably can be spelled as a disaster.This is no doubt considered as one of Disney's worst fantasy film in many decades, and also a runner-up of the worst Nutcracker adaptation behind the abominable The Nutcracker the Untold story or The Nutcracker in 3D. Also, it's also considered one of this year's worst and disappointing films.",The Nutcracker and the Four Realms

I fully agree that if you are an adult, you will find it tell a so simple story with a terrible way. But if consider yourself as a children which you may find every factors are special designed for this group. First is the time, only 1hr 39min, which also is the longest time that a child may sit still. Every line and the way tell the story are all easy for a child to understand.

They do give a fair score sometimes but sometimes they just ignore some important factors like what kind of audience is this movie facing to? Can not blindly pursue the artistry of the film with adult eyes, especially such fairy tale movies like this.

137,bigblack2009,Tchaikovsky Is Rolling In His Grave,1,4 November 2018,"Slow torture for kids and grownups alike, The Nutcracker and the Four Realms gives a bad name to the very concept of family entertainment. What went wrong? Where to begin?!? On the surface, this Disney debacle seems like a no-brainer for the holidays: It's an 1816 gothic fairytale by E.T.A. Hoffman and a ballet with music by Tchaikovsky. What we have here is simply a botch job with two directors - Lasse Hallstrom (My Life as a Dog) for starters and Joe Johnston (Jurassic Park III) for reshoots - and absolutely no personality of its own. Dance fans can look forward to a pair of all-too-brief appearances, including one over the end credits, from ballet great Misty Copeland. After that, composer James Newton Howard smothers the sounds of this perennial seasonal favorite in aural swill.It's Christmas Eve in in Victorian London, and clever Clara Stahlbaum (Mackenzie Foy), the 14-year-old embodiment of female empowerment, is in a funk. Her mum has recently died (there goes Disney again with the dead parent thing) and neither Clara nor her siblings are in the mood to follow their mopey dad (Matthew Macfadyen) to a lavish Christmas ball. Not to mention that her father insists she wear dead mum's dress - creepy, right? Mum has left gifts behind for her children. Clara gets an egg-shaped box with no key to open it. Frustrating, yes? So is mum's note: ""Everything you need is inside."" At the party, the young woman seeks out her godfather Drosselmeyer (Morgan Freeman in paycheck mode), a toymaker who zaps her into another dimension. If only he could zap audiences out of the multiplex.Any hope that things will pick up are quickly dashed when Clara enters ""the four realms,"" where it turns out her mum was once queen. Hope you like headache-inducing vistas that can leave you in a digitally induced coma! And good luck figuring out why the leaders of the realms are at war with each other! Searching for answers, Clara teams up with a Nutcracker soldier named Phillip (Jayden Fowora-Knight), and an animated mouse. It seems like Mother Ginger (Helen Mirren, reduced to mugging) is evil. Or maybe it's flower-covered Hawthorne (Eugenio Derbez) or icy Shiver (Richard E. Grant)? Or how about Sugar Plum, who seems to be having a squeaky-voiced meltdown in the welcome distraction of Keira Knightley's helium-high portrayal of toxic cotton candy.Any description of what follows, including a battle of tin soldiers, clowns on the attack and a swarm of killer mice, would only evoke other, much better films such as The Wizard of Oz, The Chronicles of Narnia and Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory. What this Nutcracker offers is so overproduced, so mechanical and so indigestibly whimsical that it won't just be two-year-olds who want to puke it up. Clara is told that the four realms represent a parallel world where time moves faster. Not in this movie, which slows to a crawl in the act of boring you breathless.",The Nutcracker and the Four Realms

But they're so painfully cliché - don't be surprised if both cause the adults in the audience to laugh out loud.It seems that Helen Mirren, as pseudo-villain Mother Ginger, and Morgan Freeman, as Clara's mysterious godfather Drosselmeyer, are simply thrown in to make the film more intriguing to older audiences. It doesn't work.It also complicates the film itself: Was it made for children? Families? Fantasy buffs? Adventure enthusiasts? It's unclear.I almost feel bad trashing (what I take to essentially be) a kids' movie with perfectly likable 17-year-old lead, but there's just no reason why this adaptation should exist.It feels like even children - especially in this era of on-demand entertainment and content saturation - will find the film annoying and predictable.

The story is a bit simple - you don't have to be a rocket scientist to figure it out halfway into the movie but I still really like this version with the added element of ""the sweet thing being rotten inside"" and also Keira Knightley was hilarious as this sugar-shock b***h...she should play negative characters more often.My only problem is probably that they cut the end too short and left it a bit flat without any real climax.But on the other hand again I liked how they made Clara a mini-engineer.

I got almost exactly what I was expecting- a visually beautiful beautiful fairy tale (where a good part of my stars go to). You can't really expect to have psychological debates on the story, nor will it leave you with any new knowledge on life on this planet (what fairy tale movie does?!). But it does its job well. Costumes, make up, design, music were just magical! May be it's just me, but I saw the movie also paying homage to ""The Swan lake"", which was a nice touch. Clara's music egg played the music from one of my favorite parts from the ballet and I loved it.I was a bit disappointed by some of the acting (Helen Mirren as Mother Ginger for one) and may be the story should have been given a bit more time to unfold properly and give it a bit more depth, but hey - can't always have it all.
For those who are disappointed it is not like the ballet, you surely know it is ""The Nutcracker"" season soon in most ballet and opera houses, so please go see those shows.I guess it depends what expectations one goes into the movie with, but if you want an eye candy-literately , I recommend you to go and see it.P.S.

On Christmas eve she discovers , with a little help from her Godfather Drosselmeyer played by Oscar Winner Morgan Freeman , A Magical World consisting of Four Realms each ruled by different regent.

Mackenzie Foy does a good job playing the lead and among the other actors Keira Knightley is a stand out , giveing her character a unique voice and set of mannerisms. The movie also really gives you a christmas feeling with all its snow , Christmas trees and presents. Richard E Grant and mexican comedy super star Eugenio Derbez also does a good job with their roles though both are slightly underused. Misty Copeland's role is also very small and i didn't even notice Miranda Hart. Actually i'm not even sure she was in the movie. Maybe her role has been cut from the finished film.

The Nutcracker and the Four Realms try to make their own story, but fail miserably. The film looks like a patchwork of other films. Making it a confusing and unsatisfactory plot. The plot was tedious and without surprises. There is no plot and character development, everything runs rushed and incomplete. If it occurs in Victorian London, please follow the era. There is no funny scene. Laugh at some scenes for another reason. Most characters have no charisma whatsoever, everything they do sounds forced and unenthusiastic. Blame the writers and the direction. I love Kiera Knightley, but that was her worst performance (it was painful to watch). The CGI was overused, making all the landscapes fake, and the costumes I found extravagant. In addition to several useless scenes that filled the minutes ... what a waste of time.

156,ninjachewit,It blew my expectations... in the other way,1,11 November 2018,"Be warned first of all, this movie is supposed to be about Christmas but does more to represent the Spanish War. Its message is also unclear and actually quite dangerous. Without trying to reveal spoilers, i'll go ahead and basically say that the moral of this movie is that actual family presence means nothing and can be overridden with clever purchases and their uses (aka appealing to the consumerist part of Christmas).The movie shares two tones, one being the exquisite and quite beautifully CGI rendered world of the kingdom, and the other being a Halloween looking tent that Mike Myers might want to hide out in. The part that irks and confuses me, is that there is no clear reason for why these two tonal shifts have to be so conflicting with each other in the film other than to provide an obvious front for conflict. This symbolises to me a lack of care and depth that went into the developing this film's characters or story. It was a complete attempt to appeal to the audience, there was no sacrifice on the writers part to put something original in here.

Like many of these cinema extravaganzas, originality is secondary to the visuals, with elements liberally borrowed from Narnia, The Wizard of Oz and even Dr Who all fighting for plot supremacy in a landscape lush with superficial imagination and rich colours.Keira Knightley as the Sugar Plum Fairy was the stand out star of this show, with Helen Mirren as Mother Ginger playing a more subdued role than normal.

You've heard the music in every mall and if you were ever a dancer you've danced it. But the weird modernized version in this movie will make you want to just hear damned Tchaikovsky.
I felt the same about the dancing. Show me at least a little more dancing.
The serious problem with this movie that really burned me though was the treatment of Misty Copeland. If you even have a passing knowledge of her you've seen those calves and shoulders. She's the single most striking dancer of our time. What is the deal with not showing her face and having her say at least one line? Frankly it just struck me as racist.
It's hard to lean on the plot of a ballet that essentially has no plot. It makes for a thin movie that needs more Tchaikovsky, more dance and more Misty Copeland.",The Nutcracker and the Four Realms

Disney has really missed an opportunity with this film. There is no life to it, no chemistry, no character development. It thinks it's clever but it really isn't. The CGI is poor, the acting is wooden. I was bored from the beginning to the end. Nothing made any sense whatsoever. You didn't really see two of the four realms and there was never any real explanation about what happened to the fourth realm. The ""twist"", so to speak, was the most predictable thing ever. The nutcracker soldier was just a bit part and not really particularly important. The whole thing was just a massive let down.

I was done at 39 mins.Atleast I lasted longer than ""A wrinkle in time"".",The Nutcracker and the Four Realms
162,samwillpearce,If you desire a fun family Christmas movie - look elsewhere,4,7 October 2019,"""The Nutcracker and the Four Realms"" is further evidence that Disney doesn't need to make a live action remake of, you know, literally everything. It was a film no one really asked for and few people were super fired up to see. After watching it, I can say that there's nothing awful about the movie... but there's also nothing great. It's not an abomination of filmmaking, but it's not really worth the time or the money either.
""The Nutcracker and the Four Realms"" has its good parts of course. It features some truly impressive and creative visuals, and despite the overwhelming amounts of CGI, is very pleasing to the eye. I also appreciated the ways in which the film pays tribute the the ballet it came from. The filmmakers put effort into respecting the source material despite taking some heavy creative liberties.
Unfortunately, however, there are many parts that detract from its few high points. It's super-clichéd, and many of the dialogue moments felt flat and uninspired. From a predictable plot to a silly, by-the-numbers climax, there's no genuinely tense moments. In addition, the attempts at humor were not very well written and didn't make much sense. I think I yawned more often than I laughed, if I'm being honest.
Even the three A-list actors in the film couldn't do much to save ""The Nutcracker and the Four Realms."" Dame Helen Mirren gave a surprisingly uncompelling performance as Mother Ginger (though this may have been the fault of the script) and Morgan Freeman was barely in the movie. But unfortunately the worst part was Keira Knightley (who I normally love) as the Sugar Plum Fairy-she was just kind of annoying. From her high-pitched voice to her awkward mannerisms to her straight-up unbelievable character, she was sadly one of the lowest points of the movie.
I say all this with full knowledge that the film was intended to be more of a kid's movie. But does it deliver even as a kid's movie? Sure, it's bright, colorful, pleasing to the eye and contains some fun (clean) action younger audiences will probably enjoy. But at the same time, very little context is established for the film in a way that even a young kid would notice, it's not really all that Christmasy for a Christmas movie and it's just flat out boring in parts. I'm aware that I may be judging a little too harshly for a children's movie, but I'm not even sure the movie appeals to its target audience.
Overall, I didn't think this movie was awful, but it's not good or memorable enough to be worth a watch. If you're looking for a fun fantasy film to watch with your younger siblings, you'd be better sticking with ""The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe"" or Tim Burton's ""Alice In Wonderland"" (both Disney properties as well, and both of which this movie was kind of a rip-off).

166,Fd-Up-Squirrel,Enjoyable for what it is,7,9 June 2019,"I avoided this movie based solely on it's lackluster performance and some pretty hateful reviews. I finally decided to see just how bad it was and I actually enjoyed it.
Not sure what most reviewers were expecting, but it has its moments.
First and foremost... it drags the same ""Female Lead finds she's the savior, doubts herself, finds her confidence, puts on armor/uniform and leads the charge"" storyline we've seen a few dozen times over the years.
It loosely follows the classic ""Nutcracker"" story, so if you're expecting a faithful adaptation.. don't. The cast has its moments, not always the best.. the incredible sets and worlds are shamefully under utilized.. and the fact that Tchaikovsky's gorgeous music is only sprinkled through the score are a shame.
On the upside, what little we DO see of the worlds is incredibly gorgeous, vibrant, and vivid. The costumes are just as incredible.
It's not The Wizard of Oz, but comparable to the live action Alice in Wonderland... and seriously better than ""Through the Looking Glass""",The Nutcracker and the Four Realms

168,et-89,Weird messages in this movie,3,5 November 2018,"I saw this movie with my 10 year old daughter, who thought it was bad, and I had to agree. This movie's script is terrible, and I'm tempted to go into this and discuss how I think it could have been improved, but I won't. I just want to highlight some of the strange messages one can get from it. (Spoilers ahead.)If someone kidnaps you and assaults you, they may still be a good person and you need to listen to them. (Mother Ginger uses the mice to kidnap Clara, then her frightening clowns to bully her into her presence. Clara naturally runs away, but in the end it turns out that Mother Ginger is actually good and the movie implies that Clara should have listened to her.)If someone tells you to trust them and immediately show you that you can't, you should still trust them and everything will be okay in the end. (Clara sends Captain Phillip away, then almost slips to her death, being saved by him at the last moment. He then leaves her anyway, trusting that everything will be okay as she traverses the slippery cliffs.)Regardless of how accomplished a woman is, her greatest accomplishment is having kids. (Clara's mother, who was an incredible inventor, called Clara her greatest invention, and apparently not only stopped inventing things after she was born but also never mentioned that she invented a machine that could breath life into toys. Because apparently, once you're a mother, all that invention nonsense no longer matters.)This is not a comprehensive list. Really, someone should have looked at that script with a critical eye. While Disney movies often have messages which aren't that great (like the whole princesses thing), they don't often scrape the bottom of the barrel like this one.",The Nutcracker and the Four Realms
169,mrpatras,There is no end falling in the pit of hell,1,13 November 2018,"Basically, this is a white tale played by black folk, and that's about all.

For me, I felt the music was sprinkled throughout at just the right moments - if I wanted the musical, I would go see it on stage or via a recorded session. This movie was not intended to be a rehash of the musical but instead it was meant to serve as an interpretation of the story. It had all of the right elements for me, as a viewer, and the story picked up about 15 minutes in. I'm not saying this movie was amazing - I love all genres and a rating of a 7 from me means it could've been better but I'm not asking for my money back because the film did its job. I'm really interested to see if kids today love this movie because I feel we adults critique this film based on decades of growing up with the musical.",The Nutcracker and the Four Realms

174,judeknicks,"It's bad, here's why",5,3 January 2019,"During previews for the Nutcracker & The Four Realms, there were many children's films coming soon to theaters. After counting all the previews, I found that four of six were remakes of classic stories being remade by Walt Disney Studios. The incentive for making so many films is to make a huge profit, which is a fair enough reason considering the box office takes of Beauty & The Beast, Cinderella, and Maleficent. Those were good movies in their own right, which is something that simply cannot be said about this movie. I thought the critics would be wrong, but they were certainly right about the film being bad. If Disney wants this next slate of remakes to be critically and financially successful, it must do everything it can to not to follow in The Nutcracker's footsteps. This is my first bad review in quite some time, so shall we begin?I am not used to writing reviews in the format reserved for bad movies, but since this is one, let us begin with the great aspects of The Nutcracker & The Four Realms. With a budget of $120 million, the producers and visual artists had quite a bit to work with, but certainly not enough to match the effects of the most visually splendid films, such as Avengers: Infinity War ($316-400 million), Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End ($300 million), and The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey ($200 million). Usually, films that have the same budget as this film have very noticeably CGI effects that don't come off great at least in my eyes, such as Rampage and Ghost Rider, which also aren't good film company to serve as comparison. To compare to a fellow Disney remake, Beauty & The Beast has a budget of $175 million, which was used very well. However (in a good way), The Nutcracker's visuals were absolutely on par with those visually splendid films. The world's created with the CGI were beautifully rendered, and the set design in the real-world scenes was extravagant and fitting for the Christmas-based period in time. The costumes were also well-designed and fitting for the settings. Due to the bad reception, it is unlikely, but I truly believe that this film should be nominated for an Oscar for its costume design. Visual splendor cannot carry a film towards overall excellence, but the visuals for this film certainly keep it from sinking rock bottom.Another positive element of the film was the beautiful film score that incorporated Tchaikovsky's classic pieces and some new content very well. Of course, being a film based on classic ballet, it must have Tchaikovsky and classical music or else it would be as dumb as Gotti using Pitbull music even though it was based in the 1980s. Along with the proper incorporation of classical music, the first half of the film was a great set-up that felt homely and harkened back to some childhood memories. The sets were great, we got more of Morgan Freeman, and the ballet performance by Misty Copeland was among the best scenes in all of the film industry for 2018. That is where the praise for this film ends.With the runtime clocking in at only one hour and 35 minutes, there is so much film to pack out in such a short timeframe. With these limitations, the movie moves too fast as we enter the world of The Four Realms. There is a lot of missing information that would allow the circumstances of conflict presented to make sense if they were properly explained. Instead, there is little explanation as to why there is any form of conflict. I've begun to care less about plot holes by understanding that filmmakers seek to reap box office results first, but when a film does not give explanation as to what events occurred for conflict to exist, it just doesn't make sense.I'd say that another atrocity committed in the film was its use of clichés from other Disney films while utilizing them in the worst way possible. I was shocked by how much content and elements that The Nutcracker borrowed from other Disney films, especially considering that this is a Disney film itself. It was made worse by the fact that these elements were ultimately executed in the worst way possible. This movie borrowed heavily from the first Chronicles of Narnia, which seems like a bad sin made worse considering both films are made by Disney.Since the film aims to appeal to young viewers aged 10 and under, there was a lot of childlike humor and tone that made the film feel corny. It isn't impossible to include quality humor in a kid's film, but The Nutcrackerfell into the bad side of appealing to children. I should've expected that, but considering the maturity found in many Disney films such as The Incredibles 2and Big Hero Six, I was very disappointed and felt like I was an adult with a child's mind for sitting through the movie.The last disappointing aspect of The Nutcracker & The Four Realmswas the performances of the main leads. Mackenzie Foy, whose claim to fame was in Twilight along with a great performance in Interstellar, was largely lifeless in this movie. The delivery of the lines came out flat, which contributed to the film's corny feel. Keira Knightley exacerbated this feel with her awful, nasal voice and too many moments of overacting. I'd say that Jayden Fowora-Knight, who played Captain Philip who was supposed to be the Nutcracker but there never was any Nutcracker, also had the same problems as Mackenzie Foy. A few other actors weren't bad but just overtly childish. Helen Mirren did well with what she had, but she was barely in the movie.When trailers for the film were released in December of 2017, I was really excited for the film. The release date came perfectly in time for the beginning of the Christmas season, and the story is a timeless classic. After months of waiting and doubting the bad reviews, I can verify that those reviews were warranted. Despite a great beginning and some very positive attributes, the film largely gets lost within Disney clichés and corny moments. If you want a very good version of the classic Nutcracker story to make your holiday mainstay, just watch the Barbie version or see a live ballet. The Nutcracker & The Four Realmshas unfortunately earned its place among the very worst films of 2018, and worst films that Disney has ever made.Translating my frustrations into a rating, I would give this movie 5 stars out of 10, which means the movie is simply not worth your time. I really loved the first twenty minutes of the film, so those portions of the film would be worth watching. Otherwise, there are other ways to be productive.",The Nutcracker and the Four Realms

184,jviaes,Four Stars for Four Realms,4,6 June 2019,"What do you get when you cross feminism with the Santa Clause 2 and Kungfu Panda?Seriously, some of the key story points were taken straight out of other movies! The bad guy (girl) creates a tin soldier army that she enlarges with a machine to take control of everything. Remember the little nudges from the Santa Clause 2? And what about the moment when Clara sees her reflection in the mirror that appears in her mother's present to her? That happened to Po in Kungfu Panda when he opened the dragon scroll!Despite the plagiarism, the film did have its moments. What they did with mice becoming a one fighting being was cool, but honestly it all went downhill with Clara. Hollywood trying to force feminism down our throats is getting real old. Clara is a young girl into science and has a brilliant mind who through the entire film is doubting herself yet at the exact same time is fearless. Characters in stories are supposed to grow into those roles. Not to mention how disrespectful she was to her father. Women in the Victorian age were fearful of rejection from their fathers and here is Clara pretty much spitting in her father's face.The Nutcracker was something else altogether. The tale of the Nutcracker is slightly horrific, dark, and still shows Clara being the hero. They might as well have called it ""Clara and the four Realms."" Sure they kept the Nutcracker, sorry, Phillip, by her side the whole time but he took a back seat and basically became best friends with his mortal enemy. The original story can have so much creativity to it if they just stuck to it. Honestly all this inclusiveness Hollywood is trying to bring out is just bringing potentially good films down.",The Nutcracker and the Four Realms

I'm not such a fanatic about Disney as to believe that they don't make mistakes, and they made quite a few with this one, most especially not living up to its potential.
However, this will probably still make it into my library because it is a cute show. As far as a lot of Christmas movies go, it's a lot better than a lot of others I've seen (which of course is not a reason for a good rating, but let's allow it to be viewed and compared in its genre).

I think many who gave negative reviews also expected the film to be a movie of the ballet adhering exactly to the story but it doesn't which is not a bad thing because The Nutcracker Suit is probably one of the best know ballet in the world so giving it a bit of a rewrite gives it a new look. This is a genuine family movie suitable for all, which is somewhat of a rarity these days. The story was good, the acting was excellent.

The nutcracker has next to zero impact on the story and we learn nothing about him other than his station guarding a bridge. We don't get to explore the four realms, except for that minute long ballet/parade montage that felt completely out of place and wasn't at all enlightening. The script is flat and implausible. I found myself confused at Clara's reactions to the world around her and her complete lack of curiosity. She never once questions suddenly finding herself in a different world or finding out her mother is the queen of said world - we do see a flash back of her mother telling her that she found a world once, with flowers and sweets bla bla bla, and even then Clara didn't ask more about this or ask her mother to elaborate at all, I don't understand why. She's made out to be an intellectual and yet she questions nothing around her. I feel sorry for Keira Knightly, she was trying to do something different with her character and was just done dirty when no one told her that it sucked big time, every time her character spoke I could only cringe. The entire movie was just a superficial mess. Disney obviously just wanted to make a pretty movie because that's all this is, a pretty catastrophe and not in the profound way.

197,smilefumble,"The Nutcracker and the ""Bore"" Realms",2,3 November 2018,"Having been a fan of the Tchaikovsky ballet since I was a boy, I got excited when I learned that they were doing a new live-action adaptation of it.However, upon seeing the first trailer, while the visuals looked pleasing, it seemed to me that the film was going to do that clichéd plot where the ""chosen one"" has to save a magical land from a wicked tyrant. Disney has done that story TWICE already with Alice and Wonderland (2010) and Oz the Great and Powerful (2013) but I still went to see it on the grounds that perhaps they would bring something new to the table.Although, I can now say that if you have seen the two films I previously mentioned, you don't need to see this one because there won't be any suspense as you will know everything that will happen.Not only that but in getting through all the clichéd plot points, the filmmakers left some holes. The villain got everyone under her thumb by making one of her fellow rulers the scapegoat but it is never explained how she convinced everybody that the other regent was evil. Also, why does she need a larger army if she has soldiers from three of the realms on her side?Additionally, while the costumes are beautifully designed, the eye-popping visuals that the trailer promised are few and far between. Having four different lands in the story was utterly pointless as the montage of Clara touring them lasted all of about ten seconds. 90% of the movie is set in the destroyed fourth realm which is shrouded in tones of black and grey. Seriously, they had magical realms of flower, snow and sweets in the story and THAT is what they focus on?Worst of all, the ""Nutcracker"" part of the title could easily be removed and it would make no difference whatsoever. The character to whom they gave that title was never cursed to be made of wood nor did he crack any nuts; he was just a normal human being. Tchaikovsky's music was scattered throughout the film in places where they could have used any other waltz and there was only a few seconds of ballet.I suppose children might enjoy this movie but those who go to it excepting a stunning, creative new take on the Christmas classic will leave sorely disappointed.",The Nutcracker and the Four Realms

Thats about it. The soundtrack is just... a let down, it felt like I was listening to trailer music.

I love Christmas and I love Disney movies, so I wasn't expecting it to be a ballet or even follow the original story, but this was just another heartless, soulless paint by numbers script. Yes the visuals and costuming was some of the best I've seen, but I imagine if they were just beautiful photographs on a gallery wall I would have enjoyed them more because I could imagine that something fun and interesting was going on, rather than the reality of this movie! Yes I love Mackenzie Foy but she can't save a dull script. Keira Knightly is as miscast as Cameron Diaz was in the Annie remake! Stop with the fake fairytale voices, it's distracting and off putting. Helen Mirren and Morgan Freeman were unnecessary big names in a story that requires not much of them.Maybe if you liked the boring Maleficent, you'll like this. At least a Wrinkle in Time had a less predictable flow. This had so much potential to be something like ""Hugo"", but just follows the same straight-line plot as the 20 previous movies made about good vs evil!

I'm not sure I liked Kiera Knightly as the Sugarplum Fairy. She just didn't seem to really fit the character for me. I loved that the movie was clean- yes fighting but no bloodshed, no bad language.

The Nutcracker and the four kingdoms, has been so far the third best delivery that has disney, behind avengers and black panther, during what was the year 2018 and so far during this 2019. Christopher robin is left behind, completely a garbage compared to this work of art.
this movie has an incredible cast and the music surpasses the previous installments, such as Cinderella, Alice in Wonderland (although it does not reach the heels of the music of the beauty and the beast, nor the special effects) but I assure you that this exceeded the music and special effects of Christopher Robin.
the duration time is acceptable, it does not last more than two hours, I think it was a great decision because the story does not arrive for two and a half hours either. nor does the story come for a saga like other deliveries. now the one chosen for the main role, it was a great decision for disney, Mackenzie Foy is a great actress and a great woman, this role that has been her best role so far in her career, I'm sure she has made mackenzie the favorites for another Disney production.",The Nutcracker and the Four Realms

220,paul-carlier,A complete mess,3,4 November 2018,"This film simply doesn't work. However, with a major studio behind it there appears to have been an effort to spend their way out of trouble. Firstly the plot is boring and confusing and has no direction. It wanders aimlessly. The editing is all over the place with scenes stitched together and jumping about. The acting from some of the cast, particularly the Nutcracker, is embarrassing to watch. Thankfully Matthew MacFadyen provides much needed emotional gravitas as the father and Morgan Freeman and Helen Mirran are great scene stealers. Keira Knightleys also does her best she can with a poor script. There are great actors in this film such as Richard E. Grant who are criminally underused. Hopefully they were paid well. This film clearly took so long to make, probably due to reshoots, that you can see Mackenzie Foy getting older and then younger between scenes. This is a very poor addition to Disney's recent high quality live action films.",The Nutcracker and the Four Realms

Perhaps rightly so - but as someone who has never seen the ballet and whose inner child eats up any tale that elicits wonder - I enjoyed this film.Yes, it contains the tried and true elements of Alice in Wonderland and The Wizard of Oz etc, but that's what makes it shine as a compilation of these stories for a new generation.

My husband and I were commenting that the sets and costumes were lovely, probably being lined up for a Disneyland ride, but the story made no sense, the acting was abysmal. The story fell flat, four realms were introduced but they seemed to play no part at all in the story, the acting by the ""regents"" was so over the top it reminded us of a third grade play. The complete 180 by sugar plum mid movie was ridiculous. Really, it was just annoying. I can't tell you how it ends because we just got up and left. And I do not have high artistic standards.

Lots of homage to the old classic Nutcracker stories both stage and films.

As for the main powerhouse Kiera Knightley really knocked it out it of he park , she gives one of the most bizarre yet unique performances of the year. She's clearly having a good time and it shows she definitely makes the picture for me . Miran is ok very underused. Jayden Fowora-Knight on the other hand is another star I hope to see more of in the future just a brilliant actor.

232,dgardner-8,Leave Nutcracker Ballet Expectations at Home!,8,8 November 2018,"I don't think I have ever been more impressed - and simultaneously disappointed - in a Disney movie in my entire life! The Nutcracker and the Four Realms is a gorgeously filmed fairy tale, filled with absolutely stunning visual scenes. The CGI images are wondrously and seamlessly integrated with the ""real"" actors and the plot has all the necessary ingredients of an exciting and fanciful adventure. Mackenzie Foy as Clara does a credible job as the main character, and veterans Morgan Freeman and Helen Mirren add necessary interest to their roles. But if anyone ""steals the show,"" it would be Keira Knightley as Sugar Plum.However, having enjoyed numerous productions of the Tchaikovsky ballet over the years as an annual Christmas tradition (in earlier days), I was dismayed to find that this film is clearly in the category of ""inspired by,"" and not ""based on"" its famous predecessor. I was hoping that the movie would use Tchaikovsky's themes and perhaps mirror the (admittedly limited) structure of the ballet. Although the score hints at the original composition from time to time and there are some very beautiful ballet scenes (including during the closing credits) the film is only superficially related to the original.That said, my guess is that seeing it again - without my ""originalist"" expectations - I might enjoy the film even more than the first time. Also, the visuals are at times so incredibly rich, this film may achieve in time a high level of acceptance on its own merits. So my advice is, by all means, go see this movie and enjoy it for what it is: a new Disney fairy tale inspired by a beloved work of art. But be sure and leave your Nutcracker Ballet expectations at home before you go!",The Nutcracker and the Four Realms

234,tealgalaxy,Enjoyable family movie,9,4 November 2018,"I don't understand why this film has so many hateful reviews. As someone who loves Disney movies, I can safely say I thouroughly enjoyed this. I don't know a great deal about the original story or the ballet, but the film stands on it's own very well. Although I felt I was watching a spin-off of Tim Burton's Alice in Wonderland in parts, my high expectations for the film did not disappoint.
I felt every actor fitted their role perfectly, espically Mackenzie Foy, who in some ways brought the entire film to life. It's not without it's flaws, but don't go to watch this film with the expectation that it'll be anything more than a coming of age story made by Disney. It's not phenomenal, but it's perfect for people who want to watch a decent family film.

236,alerasoul,"I Really, Really Wanted to Like This",5,20 March 2019,"Without spoilers, I'll say there are just too many individual moments within the movie that make it just outright weird. I'd compare it to ""Pan"" in this regard, where the movie starts out and maintains its curious setup in an interesting way for the first 28 minutes (to the second). Then, things get really, really awkward, and just continue to get even more so.The story doesn't really work, in my opinion. At first it's pretty interesting, but then it takes a nosedive into the realm of ""I want to look like Tim Burton made me"", and it fails spectacularly. The acting is fine, technically, if you put it to who the characters are supposed to be, but even then, there are aspects of choices made that feel off, and sometimes out of place. Keira Knightley's performance as Sugarplum is surprisingly awful. I consider Keira's acting to be stellar in everything I've seen her in. This was just painful. I suppose, though, it might have been a director's choice?The ending (the very, very ending), in my opinion, restored some semblance of some heartfelt stuff we can feel with (familial love, all that jazz), which is why I rate this a 5/10. There were a solid 35 or so minutes of the movie that I enjoyed thoroughly enough to merit this a 5. And again, about 28 of those minutes are the beginning. After that, there isn't much I found enjoyable.I rarely write reviews, though I've seen over 1,500 films in my time. I thought I'd write something for this one, seeing as I personally had a strong desire to enjoy this film. I really did. I was even willing to give it some benefit of having some bad moments. But alas...",The Nutcracker and the Four Realms
237,lucyania,I have no idea why people didn't like this movie.,10,16 January 2021,"At the beginning I was very critical, thinking that the costumes are a bit too clean, too cliché and the sugarplum fairy is acting absolutely fake and wondered why in the world my favourite actress would interpret a character this way or if it was the director's idea. Then plot twist- she was acting fake because she's the villain! I should have seen that coming but I guess most kids won't either. And the realms aren't all perfect, I loved the feel of the 4th realm and the contrast of them. And I just love the lesson of sticking together as a family in awful times like going through grief. Overall I just think it was such a visually stunning movie and that ballet scene at the end was just lovely. If I have kids, this will be one of the first movies I will show them.",The Nutcracker and the Four Realms
238,flyntlock,"No seriously, was Matthew Macfadyen the original nutcracker?",7,26 October 2019,"This movie was weirdly not for children in my opinion, considering there's a lot of fantasy violence, but...Going in, it's a very ""Alice Through the Looking Glass"" situation with the reveal that Clara's mother was the ""original Clara"" (not sure if she was named after or had her name changed after her mother passed away?) that ruled one of the Four Realms as their queen until her departed and passing away of in the real world.I thought this was going to be a complete re-telling of the original ballet acts until there was that sort-of reveal. I GENUINELY enjoyed the world-building that went into this new level of weird and at some parts it was actually quite horrifying (in regards to the tin soldiers and their dead, dead, dead-dead-dead eyes as they walked about). I really enjoyed the kingdom divide as represented in the original as very unique and distinguished locations, and the character design is lovely and fun.Looking at who wrote (and especially directed) this kind of gives you a look into how and why the movie's structure, world-building, and overall tone is the way it is. The movie takes itself seriously in a LOT of places but begins to ease up on those reigns as you are further introduced to the whimsical aspects.The whole movie I was going ""Macfadyen's character is sort of just there, wouldn't it be strange is he was a nutcracker taken from the realm?"" as stated that they can leave but their fate was uncertain. He ""becomes human"" in the end of the ballet (which apparently in THIS movie-verse wasn't a ""dream sequence"" but a temporary realm jump). However, the question remained LITERALLY up until the VERY END OF THE MOVIE where Clara's father hears the music box and reflects on it as some forgotten, but comforting tune he and their mother once danced to. The WHOLE movie he was weirdly insignificant until that last minute of the POSSIBLE implication that he is more to the story.Call it a theory but it's the only way I can justify those otherwise pointless scenes.",The Nutcracker and the Four Realms

240,brucegiff607,An Unfortunately Generic Fantasy Film,4,15 December 2018,"The Nutcracker and the Four Realms is what you get when you combine something like Narnia with The Nutcracker. Clara (Mackenzie Foy) receives a present on Christmas Eve from her dead mother: a golden egg that needs a key to open, but without the key. At a Christmas party her family goes every year, she's led into another world created by her mother where toys are alive! The world is divided into four realms, but one realm has revolted and is controlled by the evil Mother Ginger (Helen Mirren). With the help of a loyal nutcracker, Phillip (Jayden Fowora-Knight), Clara now must help save the kingdom and find the key stolen from her.There is one element in this film I can safely say is great: the music. Grant it, The Nutcracker is ballet with famous classical music automatically associated with it, and by adding such music, composing the musical score might have been half done already. There is original music in the film, as well, and it is composed in a way that doesn't feel out of place compared to the other music and help add music you'd expect in an exciting, epic fantasy. I honestly love the musical score in this film and find it to easily be the best thing about the film. When I look back over the films from this year, The Nutcracker and the Four Realms might even make my top 10 musical score/soundtrack in a 2018 film. It's probably the only element worthy enough to be in a top 10 of the year.For the most part, I find the acting to be either alright or just meh. I like Jayden Fowora-Knight's performance as the nutcracker. I also like Helen Mirren as Mother Ginger and I feel she has the best performance in the film (which isn't saying much when most people are just okay). There is very little of Morgan Freeman, Eugenio Derbez, and Richard E. Grant, but they are good as well for what they are given. I feel the visual effects and cinematography is good, as well. The visual effects are a little iffy at times, but sometimes it feels acceptable to be bad or cartoony when the world and characters are toys come to like. There is still some bad visuals here and there, but it all evens out to be good visual effects overall.The worst thing about the movie, in my opinion, is the story. Think of any cliché that's in a fantasy movie where a character from the real world enters a fantasy world, and all or most of those clichés will be in this one. There is just something about the story that feels generic and done too many times. It's overly predictable, as well. I managed to figure out the twist in the film before the halfway mark. There were just too many clues that gave it away. As soon as a ""good"" character mentions she just needs a key for a machine that can bring to life an army to help ""defend"" the kingdom, I realized that this was actually the villain of the movie and she wants to make the army to rule the kingdom. There is very little to the story as well, making it feel as hallow and basic as the army the villain creates (tin soldiers).There are some forced comedic jokes in the film. Some might seem like they could flow into the story, naturally, but most feel like they stop the movie to make a ""funny"" moment. The ""funny"" scenes revolving around the two comedic soldiers are excruciating. I also don't like most of the characters in the film. I found the main character, Clara, to be annoying at times. Some of Mackenzie Foy's line delivery in the moments where she's mad makes me think of her character as more of a clueless brat more than a character I want to care about. Some of it could have been saved. She's mad at her father at the beginning, because she believes he's forgotten about their mother and just wants to continue on like her death never happened. Except, it's very clear his character is hurting and deeply misses his wife. If the actor had been more subtle with his sad expressions, maybe we would be on Clara's side and realize he's actually sad when she realizes it. Because his saddens to too blatant, I immediately sided with the father over our main character. I just wanted to scream at her, ""Open your eyes!""Keira Knightley's performance as Sugar Plum is really bad. I find the voice she uses in this movie irritating. It doesn't help that practically all her dialogue after twist happens is awful.In the end, The Nutcracker and the Four Realms isn't a horrible movie, but it's too predictable and generic to be good. It's just very meh.Story: 4

250,egsayers-99737,"Pretty good, all things considered",7,16 August 2021,"I waited three years to watch this because of the bad reviews. Honestly, I expected the worst, and so obviously I found it better than expected. I think that's probably the problem with the bad reviews; they expected it to be this revolutionary Disney hit, not to mention much closer to the ballet. Spoiler: it's nothing like the ballet, but this is Disney, so why would we expect it to be?There are, of course, the cheesy lines and the Disney sap, but at the same time, I don't think it was as emotional as it could have been. It's about not only a daughter but an entire kingdom dealing with the death of a loved one - it should have included at least one tearful speech, but it didn't. However, there is no unnecessary romance, which I personally appreciated. The ""not like other girls"" tune isn't as bad as one would expect from your typical Girl In Victorian England Movie, and Clara never voices a word against dresses or corsets, merely saying that she's not good at that stuff. I feel as though they played up the ""Clara is an engineer and a scientist"" aspect and then didn't allow her to utilize her scientific smarts as she could have.The climax of the film felt lackluster, as did a few of the performances, but overall it was good. I don't understand people criticizing Mackenzie Foy, as I felt her performance was perfectly normal. Kiera Knightley was absolutely wonderful as Sugar Plum, and Helen Mirren as Mother Ginger was great. Morgan Freeman didn't have much time to shine, but he made the most of what he got. Clara didn't fight much, or well, but why would she? She's a teenage girl in Victorian England, it's not like she's going to know jiu jitsu. Admittedly, rest of the fighting was clunky, which contributed to the anticlimactic nature of the climax.I loved the costumes and the visuals, which very much lived up to expectations. I don't believe I was ever distracted from the film by bad CGI. The soundtrack too was amazing, repurposing the ballet's music, along with adding a little of its own flair. At times, it was very reminiscent of 2010's Alice in Wonderland and 2014's Maleficent, but I loved those soundtracks as well so I count that as a good thing.I also liked the little details, callbacks to the ballet, such as the robotic Mother Ginger's skirt being a circus tent (in the ballet, Mother Ginger is played by a man on stilts in a VERY large skirt which acts as a tent that children run out from under). There is more ballet in this movie than I expected, and the end credits are worth the watch for it.All in all, this was a very typical Disney movie, with good performances, great soundtrack, and amazing visuals. I really don't get the horrible reviews. Did we watch the same movie?",The Nutcracker and the Four Realms
251,funwsin,"Poor acting, boring story, nothing in common with ""real"" Nutcracker",1,12 November 2018,"Huge disappointment. The acting was amateurish. Not even Helen Mirren could save the movie. Morgan Freeman in his usual ""I am wiser than anyone else"" role. The composer of the music believed he could do better job than Tchaikovsky.
Aside from bad story, directing and acting, the 3D was distorted, the effects were cheap and obvious, the picture was bleak and smeared. Colours muddy and dark. Total disaster. I will think twice before I go to see another Disney fantasy movie.",The Nutcracker and the Four Realms
252,miangalyr,Stunning visuals don't make up for the hollow story,1,15 December 2018,"Everything in the entire story is centered around Clara. She's at the heart of the clockwork and everything revolves around her. I wonder why they even bothered to put ""The Nutcracker"" in the title...
While the visuals and the choice of props and colors were excellent, the plot is tiresomely predictable, even for a family movie. The dialogue is flat and cliché. Most of the characters seem somewhat forced into being instead of feeling like natural persons.
From my point of view, this movie took the original story and drained it of its magic. This might be enjoyable if you haven't read the original story or seen any adaptation of it. Otherwise, it might be best to save yourself the headache.
In a nutshell -no pun intended-, and at the risk of sounding cliché myself, ""the book was better"".",The Nutcracker and the Four Realms

However, dialogue and story is beyond muddled. Internal logic makes no sense. Another fairy tale is now an edgy political commentary and an ""epic war"". World feels confined and claustrophobic. A bunch of tired Disney cliches surface here, like moping about dead mothers and Chosen One Princess. They even have a twist villain, because that's so beloved.It's cynical and unpleasant.

And i was like okay, lets just wait. I do not see the cast, all i know is that mckenzie foy is in this movie. So i was just waiting for the nutracker to finally show himself. For the half of the movie. And never find him until the end of the movie. If you mean the nutracker is that doll army, than it just destroying the story i know.

I feel as though this was a part 1 in a series because of all the unanswered questions, and knowing Disney...it probably is. I wasn't as annoyed with the acting as other reviewers seemed to be...just the potential of a beautiful world and story. I've never seen the nutcracker ballet, or know the story too well.

The visuals are absolutely stunning and the music is wonderful. The plot is a bit convoluted and there are certainly some unnecessary aspects, but nothing that is too distracting. This is absolutely a popcorn movie, just go enjoy the visuals and the fun, don't try to analyze it as high art.Unfortunately, as a typical Disney movie, it revolves around a child who lost a parent and must learn to deal with it. But the ending justify's the emotions pretty well and it is all handled in a healthy way.There are a few semi-intense scenes where they got nervous, but nothing really scary happened. The relationship of the main character and the nutcracker is a little odd (are they flirting? is he even real?) but it is not a main plot point so it is a minor issue.",The Nutcracker and the Four Realms

It's not perfect by a long shot the story is very thin. but I must talk about loads of 1 star attention seeking reviews on here. I can understand u not liking something but to rate it 1 out of 10 means it's one of the worst movies ever made which it is not. I really don't understand the hate it's not memorial or one of those films u would want to watch again I give it 7 out if 10 meaning an above average movie nothing special but worth a watch with young children if u have them.,The Nutcracker and the Four Realms

The costumes are terrible,really terrible, Kiera knightly's acting is by far the worst I've seen since Elton johns awful appearance in the second kingsmen film! The entire film lacks flow,story,continuity and is above all boring.The four of us that went all agreed it was probably the worst film we've seen and we visit the cinema a lot! Such a shame, just laughably badly made/designed costumes,shocking acting,week storyline and no real pull to keep you watching.

274,tad-cornell-com,Utterly lifeless (light spoilers for first ten minutes),2,12 June 2019,"I didn't go in with high expectations. Even still, I realized within the first fifteen seconds of the film that it was going to not be worth the time (though I continued anyway). I will start by saying this film relies heavily on bad CGI to try and convert a large sense of scale and grandeur. The opening shot is a fly over of Victorian London. There is, however, no depth or texture to the CGI which makes it all fall incredibly flat. It's incredibly lazy.The story itself is cliche as cliche could be, and that much is obvious within the first ten minutes wherein we learn the protagonist, Clara, is somehow a genius who knows Newton's laws of thermodynamics despite being a girl in Victorian London and this not having access to this type of education (so may argue The Godfather taught her, but it doesn't seem the case); the mother is dead, because it wouldn't be a Disney film without that; the father can't express emotion because of course we need the father/ daughter tension; etc. it's cliche after cliche with the movie. It's also chock full of plot tensions which don't go anywhere and get resolved within five minutes (the two times Clara doubts herself and then gets over it particularly stand out).I'm all honesty, it feels like the studio wrote the film without an actual writer who cared in the slightest. If a film were to be produced entirely in a factory on an assembly line, this movie would be the result. It is an utterly lifeless film devoid of any semblance of heart.",The Nutcracker and the Four Realms

277,Abdullah-Al-Mamun,The cast was pretty good.,5,17 December 2018,"Went to see this yesterday and I have to say that I was pretty confused about everything because the story is all over the place. I think it's a good movie for kids, at least over 13-14. Some scenes were pretty creepy for a small kid and I think it can give them nightmares. There weren't any kids in the movie theatre though so I guess that says something about the movie. There were some scenes where I was really creeped out and I can honestly say that the clowns in this movie are scarier than IT !The story follows Clara as the ventures into this parallel universe where toys are alive. These realms were created by her mother, who upon passing away, left a music box to Clara without a key, so obviously she searches for the key and ends up in this universe. There she meets many people that are gonna help her find out what message her mother left for her. I don't wanna tell you more because I don't wanna spoil it.The cast was pretty good. I actually really liked the actress who played Clara, I think she was Renesmee in the Twilight series. I think she's gonna be a great actress and I can't wait to see more of her. As for Keira Knightly...I'm so over her. She was so annoying in this movie. I do believe she did a great job, but I just don't like her that much so she wasn't one of my favorites. I feel that the Nutcracker had very few lines and was pretty much forgotten for the majority of the movie, many of the other charaters felt more like fillers than actual people. That's all I have to say about this movie. I think it's a great movie to watch during the holidays, but don't expect to be blown away.

I watched this movie twice in one day just because I wanted to savor every detail. Every window, every wall, every doorknob,... beyond stunning. I enjoyed the story and the acting was fun. Especially Keira Knightly her different way of acting was very quirky and fun. And the decor of the ballet scene was also beautifully done. I am so thankful for creative movies like these.

All the rest was flat and I was annoyed by the acting of the Nutcracker.
*The costumes overall were ok but when I saw Hawthorn with his green eyebrows and Shiver with his plastic icicles I had to keep myself from laughing.
*Then the biggest flaw of them all; the plot. It was all over the place... I was left with so many questions unanswered;
-Why did her mother send Clara to this world? Did she know there was a war? If so, why didn't she go and save the realms? Why did she not want her other children to go see this world?
-Howcome everybody simply believed what Sugar Plum said about Mother Ginger? And what exactly díd she say Mother Ginger had done? Did everybody simply believe Mother Ginger attacked the realm without anybody ever seeing anything?
-What on earth was the point of sending the owl along with Clara?
-Marie said Clara was her best creation...uhh..what about her other 2 children?
-What had happened to all the inhabitants of the realm of Amusements?

First of all, this movie has no resemblance to the ballet. The only thing remotely similar is the first scene and maybe the waltz . It is more of a combination of Alice and Wonderland and Chronicles of Narnia.
Secondly, the acting was a cringe-worthy. Though the cast was diverse in characters, there was no real emotion between the characters. And I found the main character making me want to fall asleep. You could tell she had all scripted lines.
However, the worst part of this movie were the many cliches. During the beginning of the movie Clara's dead mother says that all that Clara needs is inside of this egg. Come to find out what's inside the egg is a mirror and she finds out that ""she is all she needs"". Like really come on? I know that Disney could have come up with something more creative.
The one saving grace was the many expensive sets. But that doesn't hide the dissapointing script, slow plot, and terrible acting. Also, Morgan Freeman had a total of two lines in the whole movie.
If you decide to watch this movie, make sure to keep your expectations low.",The Nutcracker and the Four Realms

I enjoyed Keira's portrayal of Sugar Plum however! I honestly didn't know it was her till much later., and has Elizabeth Banks as Effie Trinket vibes. I wish the Nutcracker was a bigger part...because he's...ya know... the title of the movie and all...Foy was alright but I need more emotion I guess.

311,boikova-julia,Quite a disappointment,2,3 February 2019,"Was really looking forward to this when saw an advert, but I am rather disappointed I after I watched it. Terrible story line, rather predictable and not interesting at all. Also actors have incredibly silly lines. Yes it is for kids- but it could have been done way better. Feel sorry for the actors too, great cast, but it is one of those scenarios when even the great cast couldn't have saved it from being bad. Costumes - bugs me as much as bad directing and story line - some of them were okay, but some looked like students work - very immature and overdone in a bad way. Just because it is Disney movie doesn't mean you need to shove all things different colour possible together and you think it will work. Sugar plum should have been wearing more than one outfit, looked a little cheap that she wasn't (the dress fit was bad and didn't suit Kiera knightly) . Misty Coppelands first dress was too big, and you couldn't see all her beautiful movements. Helen Mirren had super bad make up and costume, made her look frumpy and not complimentary to her character.",The Nutcracker and the Four Realms

The scenery, costumes, and imaginative story make it a magical and indulgent viewing experience. I am planning to rewatch it during Christmas time this year with my husband. I found the plot easy to follow, and I liked that they changed things up with some cultural diversity and a Black nutcracker. Disney is doing well with pushing boundaries and becoming more inclusive as we have also seen with Beauty and the Beast and other films. One thing that I would have liked was a bit more music from the ballet, but I am not sure if I just missed some of it due to watching while being tired. I recommend people watch this with an open mind, and not expect it to be the same exact story in the ballet.

Well good but not really as great as I wanted it to be. It does have some good action and characters but what's really great about the movie is the score. I thought it was good, especially that Disney logo reorchestration. The way they depict the Four Realms is beautifully designed, especially the castle in the center of it all.All in all, I gave it an 8/10. You would either watch it on a Disney Cruise or on the Streaming Service.",The Nutcracker and the Four Realms
319,lauraehrhardt97,It's an enjoyable movie.,7,2 November 2018,"I really enjoyed this film. A lot of the negative reviews seem to be awfully nitpicky for a family Disney movie. It's no masterpiece but I can't understand all the hate.As we can all agree, it's visually stunning. The costumes are magnificent as well as hair and makeup. The sets are stunning and surprisingly, according to some of the interviews I've watched, most of it is not CGI. They created a beautifully detailed world and it pays off.The story is not the same as the ballet, nor does it claim to be. I personally wouldn't want it to be the same. We get to experience the beloved elements of The Nutcracker in a new way. Though there's a lot of room for improvement, specifically in the script, I really enjoyed the new story. The dynamic between Clara and her late mother is great and is the real emotional draw of the film. Because it's a Disney film aimed at kids, the script is awfully cheesy at times, but not enough to be distracting.Clara herself should be a strong selling point of the film. She's highly intelligent, specifically in engineering and physics. They make it a point to differentiate Clara from her sister, Louise, a proper (for that time period) young English woman. Not that there's anything wrong with being all prim and proper, in fact, Clara admittedly does spend a lot of the film in beautiful dresses and makeup. And yet, she's still the hero and she still kicks ass. This is important because it associates these feminine traits with power.Hear me out on this. I feel like so many of the strong heroines we know and love are, in some ways, stripped of their femininity. They're typically made to be a strict ""tomboy"" who's ""not like other girls."" This by itself isn't the problem. The problem is that instead of embracing feminine traits, they diminish them. I know gender roles are bull, believe me, but I don't think women should be shamed for being what society deems feminine. You can be a bad b**** AND enjoy princess dresses. Women should not have to adopt ""masculine"" traits in order to succeed. Because of this, I think Clara is a fantastic role model for young girls who will almost undoubtedly take something from her.So, although it's far from perfect, it's fun, beautiful, and full of heart. It's not claiming to be the next Shawshank Redemption so I don't see why it's being drilled so hard. It's a delightful little Disney movie, don't think so much about the specifics and just enjoy.",The Nutcracker and the Four Realms
320,hernadymarcell,Nut Crack?...er,3,30 March 2019,"Keira Knightley's performance is sooo cheap and worse than amateur here,that it could made this film even worse than you thought it's possible. Give her a razzie right away! Clearly no one cared about anything at all in this movie,except the visual managers. The film starts quite promising, but don't get yourself fooled.

I took this someone to see The Nutcracker and the Four Realms, hoping it'd be enjoyable and full of laughs for us. What the hell did we watch?The thing that makes it bad is not the story line, which has been overdone to death and was so predictable that me and the date called the ending several minutes before it ended. A typical storyline like this can work well if the actors are into the performance and if it is written well. The problem is...it isn't. We don't get much backstory at all. We just know that the mom has died and now she's left her daughter to go on a quest.The performances are either over the top or not believable at all. I can see a hyperactive kid who likes adventure getting very bored with this movie. I found myself checking my phone. We don't really get much in the way of ""action"" until around 45 minutes into the film, which for a children's flick that's supposed to be about energy, is probably way too long for them. I'm 20, and it's too long for the child in me as well.The lead actress in this was worse than paint drying. Literally anyone could have acted better. Can the woman just...pretend to care about what she's in?If you're looking for something to shut up your kid for 90 minutes, than this is for you.

Yes, it is not the original Nutcracker, but it absolutely delivers on a fresh new take of the story that keeps you wondering how it will lead you through their enchanting world.Bravo to the leading lady for her intelligence and strength of character, someone I wouldn't mind my daughter looking up to. You have to use your imagination, which the world is clearly lacking these days!The original Nutcracker music was cleverly placed in throughout, which gave the right amount of nostalgia and Christmas spirit.

Well, I don't know why other people said what they did about it, but I knew in the first three seconds-- literally-- that this was going to be a great picture.
Dame Helen Mirren, Morgan Freeman, and Keira Knightley are all great in their roles and Mackenzie Foy plays her part just as beautifully as she is herself.
The film is not lacking in any sense, as far as I'm concerned. The cinematography is absolutely STUNNING, the acting is great, and I there are a lot of innovative ideas that were incorporated into this classic story to make it feel refreshed and all the more interesting.
""The Nutcracker ..."" is like a traditional Christmas dessert that you grew up enjoying year after year with some added spice and some delightful additions mixed in to make it all the more delectable this time around.

1. This is a movie not the ballet. If you wish to watch the ballet, go watch the ballet.
2. This story is not about the ballet and the original Nutcracker story line. This is the story after. Queen Marie, Clara's mother, was the original little girl from the ballet who ventured to the world of the Nutcracker.

PROS:
Art work & CGI was good.
The Clowns, the mouse king, I were awesome! (worth watching just for this).
Most of the Comidy was good.
Main actress & her father were good too.CONS:
There was no chemistry between some of the actors to make the acting smooth.
They tried to provide a good suspenseful moment but reveal the suspense too quickly thus not able to enjoy & absorb the moment.
There was several scenes where you can tell the actor didn't know what they were suppose to do & director just let it slide. Making the scene awkward instead of a special moment. (ie. Towards end of movie Boy dances with sister or nutcracker feels sad shes going back home, something was off)
What's with the buff & super toned ballerina in the intro & credits? At first I thought it was a guy in a ballerina outfit, my bad!.I'm a fan of Princes Bride, Legend, Alice in Wonderland, Harry Potter. if you like those movies then don't expect the same results because its far from being that good.

They were wonderful to look at, but that was all this movie had going for it. Keira Knightly and Jayden Fowora-Knight were the only acting parts that were decent.While some parts of the movie were enjoyable, overall it was boring and I was unable to really get into it despite being excited.",The Nutcracker and the Four Realms

It never purported to be something with artistic or acting bite like Shawshank. It's a family Disney Christmas fairytale. And it delivers that. I didn't find it overly twee or overly forced or anything. It was magical, and sweeping and fun. My kids certainly enjoyed it too. I'm amazed so many people hated it. It was a lovely film.",The Nutcracker and the Four Realms
363,tneiderer-674-306750,While not the best... kids really enjoyed it,8,31 May 2019,"Yes- some of the acting and CG was not the best, but my 4 year old and 10 year old really enjoyed it. I knew going into it it wasn't going to be 'The Nutcracker' as the name of the movie is 'The Nutcracker and The Four Realms'. They did a good job at adding all the 'characters' and adding Tchaikovsky's scores into the film. It is a new take on the ballet story. I tried to get my kids to watch the ballet...they didn't last long. When reading other reviews on here I'm assuming they were expecting the ballet or they didn't go (or have) with children. All in all it's a good family movie with a new twist on an old story.",The Nutcracker and the Four Realms
364,bevmueller,Why all the hate?,9,6 January 2020,"I read reviews prior to watching the Nutcracker and the Four Realms and couldn't understand how a major Disney movie can be anything less than a 7 let alone boarder on a 5. Some people seemed to be appalled by its similarities to such movies as Harry Potter, Narnia and Alice in Wonderland.
How is that a problem?
In comparison to these other movies I'd say that the Nutcracker and the Four Realms was equal to, in merit, to each of them. And neither of those listed have a corner on the market on fantasy and elegance or origination, but rather can be used as standards in which to rate other similar works by. I do rate this film as compatible to these others and well worth the watch.
In addition to the compatible merits, Nutcracker is about family ties and grieving the loss of a mother (wife and friend); of the eldest daughter finding herself through, and in spite of that loss. It is exquisitely done - beautiful to behold. It is not all about ballet or musical numbers
As some seemed to expect and decimate as a result of their shattered expectations - yet there is ballet numbers beautifully well done.
In the end, the movie moved me to tears - especially in how the family was able to be whole once more despite the hole left from their great loss of Clara' mother. It connected me to my losses (son, brother, others) giving me hope that my family can heal also.",The Nutcracker and the Four Realms
365,josilyn_and_gackt,"Different, and very good",8,9 February 2019,"I enjoyed it. It is a different take from the original piece of story, but that's how it's always supposed to go in Disney. Make it different and to revel who is the villain in the end. That's why it adds a twist within half way within the movie, cause that's what's make it enjoyable and I do love the twist in story that Clara is the main character that she understands what she most do is right.",The Nutcracker and the Four Realms
366,laughingurlie16,"May not be perfect, but it's a lot of fun!",8,9 November 2018,"I feel like a lot of love went into this movie. The visuals are beautiful, which was mainly what I was looking for when I decided to see it. The costumes, the appearance of the realms... all beautiful! Kiera Knightley's performance is a lot of fun. I enjoyed seeing her as the giggly Sugar Plum Fairy instead of the more serious roles she typically plays. The movie contained a diverse cast in a way that wasn't distracting, including an appearance by ballerina Misty Copeland. I'll admit that some parts were rather cliche and predictable, but it's also a ""family film,"" so I try to keep in mind that they're not really going for subtlety. As a warning to people with children, a few minor characters are a little creepy-looking, such as weird clown-things and expressionless toy soldiers. Overall, I found it to be a sweet movie with some heartwarming messages, and very pretty to look at!",The Nutcracker and the Four Realms
367,er_nat,Great family film,8,5 November 2018,"I'm not comparing this to anything else. This isn't some grand Oscar winning movie. However, as a re-imagined take on the traditional nutcracker story I found it to be enjoyable. So did the crew of 7 adults and 10 kids who saw it. The acting was great, the costumes inspiring, so much so that all the kids and adults want to ""be that for Halloween"".Not every film needs to be Oscar worthy to be considered worth seeing. I was thrilled to see Misty Copeland dancing. I loved how the music was woven in. As someone who has seen ""The Nutcracker"" ballet countless times I was intrigued by how the different aspects of the original story were sprinkled throughout. This movie is great for families. Kids about 5 & up will be fine. There's a few parts they may need to hold a hand, and then they'll be great.Some people like to rip apart films that most families will absolutely enjoy.",The Nutcracker and the Four Realms
368,bluebonnetdream21,Simply Lovely!!!,10,9 November 2018,"I loved every single bit of this movie-from beginning to end!Where to even begin: the cast; the costumes; the familiar crossover of the classic we've all seen in some variation or another throughout the years.I loved the whimsy of it all... the ease with which the characters lept from the screen and captured your attention with each moment. And, there was humor! I loved Whitehall making an appearance-any sort of silliness like that just makes my day.I loved the sincerity with which Clara's character searched for answers, for true meaning in it all-I felt I could relate to that sense of loss most of us have unfortunately had to endure. The humanity of her character and gentle nudge the writer gave to portraying her as a strong, capable young woman, but not in such a way that it ever diminished anyone else and their worth.Oh... and how can I not mention... Mr. Darcy... as the father-it was almost too much for my heart to handle. I adored how they reconciled at the end.And that again is why I'll say... this film was simply lovely in ever possible sense of the word!",The Nutcracker and the Four Realms

381,sarihewlettpacheco,The Nutcracker and the Four Realms,8,18 November 2018,"I saw this movie tonight after much anticipation. Yes I read and heard the negative commments, however, I never base seeing a movie on them. What do I look for in any film, well a few things such as...believability, set construction, costumes, attention to detail, story, the point of the story, character chemistry, and the ebb and flow fo the story. The set and costumes are magnificently done. In close ups the attention to detail is spot on. The story does not try to be what the original ballet is about. Instead it gave you a different look at a familiar story. If you look at the film for what it was then believability was there. It's a fairy tale, which means nothing is real so anything can be real. The point of the story is to show a young lady who has suffered a loss that all is not really ever lost its always with you and in doing so it helps to bring a suffering family together. It takes this young lady to go onto a fanciful journey to understand how to look for something that is not right in front of your eyes and see it. I gave it an 8 because it did spend too much time in places which slowed the momentum and the flow of the story. Also there were a few confusing spots. All in all it is a good family film that is light and reminds us all that even though we suffer loss and feel pain your re stronger than you think and those we loose are never lost they are always around inside each of us. This is a good thought for Christmas and any time of the year. I feel an Oscar nomination should be given for the set designs and costumes. The were beyond amazing!",The Nutcracker and the Four Realms

The Nutcracker and the Four Realms is a beautiful RETELLING of the classic Nutcracker.If you were looking for the same old tale, same old storyline, then this isn't the film for you. I suggest you rent the many replica versions already made, and welcome you to enjoy them over and over again. It is a classic for a reason.However, if your imagination is open to viewing this story with a completely fresh point of view, I don't believe you will be disappointed. I actually believe you will thoroughly enjoy it. Fantastic sets, beautiful costuming, exquisite dancing, and wonderful acting.I absolutely loved how this cast played to the overall story, the healing process, as a the main character. Keeping the story, not the individual characters, in the spotlight. It's a storyline we all must face at sometime in our lives, and this version palatable to all ages.An extra bonus for those of us that both love the classic Nutcracker and are willing to love the the new, I was completely tickled that both Marie and Clara earned beautiful roles in this story.",The Nutcracker and the Four Realms

The manuscript was really bad but the surrounding environment was partly beautiful and the directing wasn't all bad. The jokes was terrible and not even children will problably laugh to this movie. The only good acting performances was made by Morgan Freeman and Matthew Macfadyen. The CGI has gotten to much focus in the reviews, it's sometimes bad and sometimes better but not the main error in the movie, the opening is for example not bad at all.

I was really looking forward to hearing most of the score. Also, I am tired of the leftist Hollywood types slipping leftist symbols into Childrens Fairy Tales. I must say Disney did conspire with the Russians on set and costume design and I was really impressed with both the sets and costums and the use of the Katuska Doll characters. Colors were pretty.

Still, it is quite predictable and not truly touching. Yet, seeing the film is an adoption of the ballet, and since the ballet was mostly a feel-good christmas event, it stays true to the original and probably was not meant to have much depth.
The mood of the film is like the ballet: it is cosy due to the christmas theme, playful due to the music (composed by Tchaikovsky) and a bit freaky due to the costumes. The scenery and interior is probably influenced by Russia and France, the countries from which the ballet originate, and is absolutely stunning.
The film also contains parts of the actual choreography, beautifully performed and pictured in my opinion.

When the movie first started I got excited, it made me want Christmas to come, but then all that excitement left when I saw Morgan Freeman. I like him, but his casting made no sense. Why didn't he have a English accent? Especially since he raised Clara's mother and she had an English accent. Why was he the only one without an accent?

412,alan-michoacansito,Good but could have been better,6,3 November 2018,"I'm not going to lie going into the Nutcracker I surely was surprised. Unlike, many others I have enjoyed the trailers and I knew going into it I was gonna enjoy the film. Now, yes I did find the film pretty enjoyable, but I'm not going to lie this movie had some flaws. One was throughout the middle of the film the pacing was a bit to quickly. Now, that also comes to the issue of the amount of time. I felt to have told an slightly better story they should have given the movie more screen time. Not, only that I felt the story or movie itself could have been a better not that I'm saying it was horrible it had some really great twists and turns lot gonna lie, but it could have been better. I mean they were given 32 days of reshoots and my guess the producers and directors didn't really to that to there advantage. Through I do have to say the acting was marvelous. What a brilliant cast each have it there all and I'm extremely proud of Foy she did a marvelous job and can't wait for here future has for her. Not only for people who the CGI made it look unattractive I found myself dazzled when it came to special effects I was so proud of the effort the team did when it came to the design and look of the film. Also, give a huge shoutout to the composers of the film they did an outstanding job with the music just so pleasing to the ear. So, to wrap up if you know it won't sound interesting to you then honestly you shouldn't go and go watch something else, but for others I would suggest to watch it and bring your kids. Just a heads for the kids there are some quite dark and creepy moments. So, that's my review on The Nutcracker and the Four Realms. In, my opinion it was a good movie, but at some time could have been a better.

I was so bored about the story that it totally killed my enthusiasm of waiting for a twist to come...when I ACTUALLY had like a 3-4 minutes flash of having seen something better (the disturbing clowns from the circus tent - they were so morbid and bullying that at least it made me feel something about the film for a short time) I turned to my boyfrined and said: ""you know what, maybe, it is not THAT bad eventually""...he said opening his eyes: ""what? why? I fall asleep..."" and then I continued to be bored...
-""We will protect the realm!""...against what? the original plot?
it is so slow and uncreative that it hurts because we've been waiting for this film to come out for a year, the trailer seemed super exciting but I never had the feeling of being entertanied or be in a flow.-the nachos were good.",The Nutcracker and the Four Realms
417,georgeidom,It was really enjoyable if you are not buthearted by the title watch it.,10,21 November 2018,"It was a really really good farytale, just the title its a bit misleading and gets a lot of people butheart. I rate it 10 cause it has unfair rating by now from a lot of people putting 1 star. 1 star must be amateur film to put. The real rating in my opinios is 7.",The Nutcracker and the Four Realms
418,jessicacroninwalker,Disservice to Ballet,1,4 November 2018,"Great costumes, music, and scenery, but everything else was AWFUL! Completely different plot, the one ballet scene was added as an afterthought then a weird montage at the end as the credits roll. Sadly, I will not be bringing my kids to this movie. #SorryDisney",The Nutcracker and the Four Realms
419,sougata-06448,Poor movie by Disney,2,4 June 2020,"I did not expect such a poor movie by Disney. It's 2020 man not 1960!!! Poor VFX, poor character drawing ,most of the things are poor in this movie. I have wasted 1 and half hour of my life by watching bthis movie.",The Nutcracker and the Four Realms
420,ferminadaza-20161,When more is not better,5,9 November 2018,"When I think of the Nutcracker, I think of the magic of Christmas, that kind of magic that inexplicably makes unbearableall all the hassle related to Christmas. It's like the effect of a drug. But if the Christmas atmosphere is a drug, this film is the equivalent of an overdose. Disney has, as often happens, exaggerated. Someone should explain them that more is not always better. The only moment of true grace in this Christmas circus put on by Disney, is given by the performance of two exceptional classic dancers, Sergei Polunin and Misty Copeland.
Totally inexplicable was the little emphasis given to the present of the best dancer in the world, but probably the marketing department was too busy with sugar sticks and ginger biscuits under steroids, to deal with true art. Fortunately, Polunin needs no introduction and in the few minutes he appears, accompanied beautifully by Misty Copeland, even a Nutcracker without Tchaikovsky's music seems acceptable!",The Nutcracker and the Four Realms
421,frosty-87206,"Just good fun, which is nice in todays world",9,9 December 2018,"After having watched this movie I was impressed with the simplistic approach to the subject matter, and I think that helped to make it an even better movie. Yes it's easy to nit pick at it as some have done but many great movies in the past you could have done the same. I think the story has a realistic feel with a touch of magic, something which every child over 6 could understand yet fed with an undertone which only an adult would understand.The movie reminded me very much of the Princess Diaries and just as well made (if not better in some parts).My recommendation is for all young and old to see and just enjoy a very good fun movie.",The Nutcracker and the Four Realms
422,bernicevendeza,Another mediocre rendition of the nutcracker,2,3 February 2019,"Graphics and effects were beautiful, but they shouldn't have bothered with another one of these. Just like its ballet versions, this was boring and nauseating to watch. There isn't much difference from the real plot, aside from the fact that disney -just as always- felt the need to kill off the protagonist's parent just to make the movie more dramatic. It's probably a personal preference, but if you need to kill off a child's mom &/ dad to make the movie more interesting, then there's something already wrong. Our family debated very long before purchasing this movie- most of us knew it would suck. Thank God we didn't watch this in the cinema. Crap load of disappointment",The Nutcracker and the Four Realms
423,ibrahimally-56846,Just sad,4,2 July 2019,"The movie is just very fast moving from scene to scene and despite having A-list actors it's has under exploited their capabilities.
The movie has also failed to create a deep connection amongst the characters and also failed to create a satisfying tale...
This is very sad for a Disney film",The Nutcracker and the Four Realms

425,contactslbrown,Don't believe the really low reviews...,9,2 November 2018,"This is a beautifully made movie. Who cares that that changed the story slightly.Many reviewers are wanting an exciting, or funny or edge of your seat film. This is a more gentle coming of age movie. If you go with the right expectations, you will be satisfied.",The Nutcracker and the Four Realms

427,seanphilcollinspaul,Shallow,3,16 November 2018,"Is it truly worth the time, funds and effort to produce films if they are not something unique or maybe pushing the bounds a little, or throwing us a little uniqueness? The nutcracker was sweet but lacked real heart, uniqueness and a memorable feeling. Having watched attentively (with effort to keep up the attention) I couldn't help feel that I was straining to stay interested and waiting for the meaningful events or punchline to kick in. It seems we have become okay with mediocre but still expensive entertainment. Hopefully movie makers will continue to strive to entertain and not simply regurgitate ideas as this film sadly did. Either way, a big big thanks to the actors and entire army of people that strove to produce this pretty film! The ballet was wonderful and the racial diversity of the actors was great:)",The Nutcracker and the Four Realms
428,jgchenier,A (Mostly) Charming and Beautiful Film,7,7 November 2018,"Cast:
Some standouts, but mostly 'meh' if I am being honest. My favourites were Clara and The Nutcracker, because I actually enjoyed the chemistry between the two of them. Some of others got annoying after a while, though were still decent.Scenery:
My second favourite aspect of this film! I loved the way everything was designed...it felt very cartoony and unrealistic, yet realistic (in some ways) at the same time. I absolutely loved how the four realms were designed (very unique to each), though I wish we could have seen a bit more of them. London was okay.Costumes:
Here is my top aspect of the film! I loved the costumes so much...maybe a little too much, because at some points I found myself distracted by them. But I just loved the vibrant design and colour of them! Especially (I don't really think it's a spoiler because it is in the trailers...) Clara's soldier dress! That was my favourite!Storyline:
Simple, though I did have a bit of trouble following along. I basically just knew what was happening because I know the original story of The Nutcracker.Soundtrack:
Even though there was not much dancing (quick side note: the dancing that was done was really well done!), I was super happy that they added the classic and iconic music from The Nutcracker ballet, because it is my favourite instrumental soundtrack ever! It really did add to the film for me personally, and even the other music fit in nicely.Overall:
Overall, this film was a nice updated retelling of the classic story we know. But, if you are looking for that classic story, and/or a lot of dancing, you will be disappointed. I did like the four realms, and the story behind them, as well as Clara's (maybe a little bit of a spoiler?) smarts. Go in to the movie expecting a change to the story, and you will not be let down.",The Nutcracker and the Four Realms
429,sfinxbook,this movie is a mess,1,3 November 2018,"This movie is a shame for Disney Studios,
Disney used a misleading title to convince the audience.
There is not that famous The Nutcracker in this movie.
Neither children liked the movie! Extremely boring",The Nutcracker and the Four Realms
430,j-17927,Children will like it.,6,9 November 2018,"Most part of the movie is very boring. I almost fell asleep if Keria Knightley didn't become bad. The scene is beautiful . I think it will wow little girls. But for me, it's not that attracting. And for the story, not exciting at all. Just an average fantasy film.",The Nutcracker and the Four Realms
431,guidelocal,Child's Play,1,31 October 2018,"This is set up very much like a children's elementary school play, and not the good ones. The story is very strange and kinda bizarre. They try too hard to make this film suspenseful that in the end it is not. I would wait for this on streaming, not worth the theatre high prices! This is disappointing that it is coming from disney.",The Nutcracker and the Four Realms
432,seasalticecream,Where is the emotion?,2,3 November 2018,"This movie has the same problem that plagued Beauty and the Beast 2017 and Alice through the looking glass. Yes, it looks good. Yes, it kinda entertains. And yes, it´s not a god awful movie to sit through.But it´s predictable and cliched to the point where no ammount of red herrings can fool and no ammount of fake thrill can make you excited. And worse of all, it has no heart, no emotion, no motivation. There´s nothing memorable or endearing.The character are not characters, they are bland plot devices (Clara and the Nutecracker), glorified and irrelevant extras (like it sadly happens with the Flower king and the king of the land of snowflakes) or just swift cameos ( Morgan Freeman and Mother Gingerbread). The have no dimension, no porpuse, nothing that coud make the audience care about what happens to
them or the story.This is by war thebiggest flaw of the movie.Why would the audience care about a movie when its characters are so boring and dull?To add to its non existent characterization, the world building is just as awful.You never get to explore this world, to know its habitants. It feels like a superficial tour where the guide doesn´t even bother to explain what is happening, or why you should care about what you are seeing. You get to point A to point B and finally to point C, only to get thrown out of the bus without the chance to ask what the hell just happened.This is a lazy cluster of a mess, an empty husk devoid of anything resembling human emotion.I´m actually amazed someone was paid to write this thing. I´ve seen works online made by fans that are far better in both narrative structure and characterization.What a shame. You can actually see the potential this idea once had.",The Nutcracker and the Four Realms

Also used all the cliché things from Narnia, Harry Potter, Alice in Wonderland and some other movies.

448,goldenratio-96449,Mess,2,19 January 2019,"Frivolous Tchaikovsky is fine - you can claim it was adopted to the child's tender soul even though generations of excellent people grew on correctly played music. But then overgrown Klara, who seems like she has been tired with past year's experiences with correct Nutcracker. In fact, all team got so tired or ininventive with story, that they decided to make a bowl of soup, where Ch. Dickense's dark ambients are mixing with tech savvy ""Hugo"", and mice are taken for the running away rabbits from the ""Alice In Wonderland"" etc. Why does Klára have to celebrate Christmas at her Godfather's? What bothers me is when our kids grow up, they will perfectly know about presidential campaigns, bank interests, but they will not know where is this or that chunk of story comes from. Can you imagine, how dumb will their children and then grandchildren be? However 2 stars because actors did a remarkable work. general Nutcracker was the best, sir.

454,Boop87,It's a good film,8,21 February 2019,"Many are comparing this to the original Nutcracker and it definitely isn't on that level. However, I never saw anything where Disney said that it was supposed to be a full on remake. They took a bit of the original storyline and branched off into something new. Yes, there are remnants of other films but it's still a fun watch. The sets are beautifully done and the characters are entertaining. There is only a bit of actual ballet but it's done very nicely.
