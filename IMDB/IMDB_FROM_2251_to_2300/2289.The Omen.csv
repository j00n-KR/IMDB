0,MartinHafer,"Pretty silly but still watchable and high on the ""cool factor""",6,16 November 2007,"The film is about a couple (Gregory Peck and Lee Remick) whose child dies at childbirth and is replaced by the son of Satan (wow, that's a bummer). As the little lad grows, weird things happen and a couple weird people come into his life that would indicate he isn't quite the sweet little angel he appears to be. But, naturally, his parents can't believe their child is THAT bad--after all, how many parents have been INCORRECTLY told that their children are sons of Satan? I'm a school teacher, so trust me that it does happen and happens quite a lot!! Well, because the child is Beelzebub, Jr., when Peck finally is forced to acknowledge that the kid is evil, it's not surprising that all hell breaks loose--leading to a thrilling finale.This film is featured in the wonderful book ""The Fifty Worst Films of All Time"" by Harry Medved. And while I generally agree with his picks, there were a few films listed that seemed more like ""guilty pleasures"" or ""cult films"" instead of truly bad films. Sure, this is NOT one of the better films of the 1970s, as in places it all seemed awfully silly and over-done, but STILL it is pretty watchable because on a superficial level it is pretty cool. Now a thinking and overly critical viewer will notice all the silly religious mumbo-jumbo, so I advise you to turn off your brain when you watch the film and just accept it for what it is--a relatively high-budget and silly horror film that won't change your life. Sure, at times it all seems very histrionic but do we always have to watch intelligent or thought-provoking films? So, the next time you want some silly eye candy, try this film--it's not all that bad and will most certainly keep your attention.",The Omen
1,TheLittleSongbird,Still atmospheric and genuinely frightening,9,30 December 2010,"The Omen... it's a great film, and one of the best of the horror genre. It still remains atmospheric and genuinely frightening after all this time, and no matter how many times I've watched it the impact is still there. One or two parts may have dated slightly, other than that, and knowing me it's me being picky, there's little to complain about. the Omen is especially held together by a truly unsettling atmosphere and some imaginative death scenes. Jerry Goldsmith's score is also fantastic, and the film looks very nice. Richard Donner's direction is excellent, the pacing is just about right and the cast is distinguished, not only from Gregory Peck but also from David Warner, Leo McKern and especially Lee Remick as well as a genuinely terrifying Billie Whitelaw. In conclusion, just great and highly recommended. 9/10 Bethany Cox",The Omen
2,bkoganbing,Revelation Comes To Life,7,10 June 2007,"The Seventies brought both devil worship and Bible prophecy as subjects for the cinema and the two best known examples of the genre were The Omen and The Exorcist.Gregory Peck is a rich American industrialist whose wife, Lee Remick, has just lost her child at birth. In a moment of vulnerability he makes a deal with some rather strange people who provide him with a newborn as a substitute. Lee and Greg leave the hospital in Rome with Lee none the wiser. Shortly after that Peck is appointed the American Amabassador to the United Kingdom.When people start meeting all kinds of strange and bizarre ends around young Harvey Stephens as Damien, a few bells do start going off. But the film ends with most of the cast dispatched by satanic forces looking to protect the devil's own.Peck and Remick do fine in the leads, they both realize that the roles and the film will indeed be subjects for satire later on, but perform without any tongue in cheek at all. My favorite in the supporting cast is Patrick Troughton, best known as the second of the Doctor Whos, and he plays a corrupt Roman Catholic priest. In bizarre endings he meets one of the most bizarre. Ditto to Holly Palance, Jack's daughter who plays young Damien's first governess.These films aren't exactly my cup of tea. But The Omen made a mint back in the day and who can argue with that?",The Omen
3,Leofwine_draca,Not just one of the best 1970s horror films - one of the best horror films full stop,10,8 September 2016,"A classic religious horror film about the Antichrist, enlivened by fine performances from a distinguished cast, inventive and outrageous special effects, superior Oscar-winning music from Jerry Goldsmith, and excellent production values. This and THE EXORCIST remain the best religious-themed horror films of the 1970s. For once, we get an original tale for this film. As an added bonus, it was filmed in Britain, which adds authenticity for me as a viewer. Gregory Peck is perfectly cast as the father who is forced to realise that his son is evil. The film manages to be genuinely chilling, helped somewhat by the classic music which many films have used since. The best example of this is the build up to Troughton's death, where a storm blows hundreds of leaves around and the music plays loudly, alerting us to the fact that another impending death is due.Speaking of deaths, this film has lots of them, and they're all fantastic: hanging, impaling, falling, stabbing, shooting, and finally decapitation, which is the most spectacular of them all, and much remembered by those who have seen the film. They're meaningful and exciting, for a change, unlike those in most slasher flicks I can think of. Gregory Peck, Lee Remick, Patrick Troughton and especially David Warner are all good actors and actresses and it shows. Warner in particular plays a sympathetic but doomed character. The film was hugely successful and has spawned three sequels so far, two of which continue the same formula with Damien, but the last one decided that the evil one was a girl and is best forgotten. Inventive, chilling, and totally convincing, THE OMEN is a must for every movie fan. A classic, what more can I say?",The Omen
4,SnoopyStyle,Memorable images in slow moving film,7,25 October 2013,"Robert (Gregory Peck) and Katherine Thorn (Lee Remick) are a loving couple. They're desperate for a child. With their stillborn child, a priest suggests replacing the dead child with a healthy newborn and not telling Katherine. He is the new US Ambassador to Great Britain, and Damien is now 5 years old. Strange things start to happen when Damien is around.Rarely has a child look more menacing but they have made Harvey Stephens truly creepy. It's a slow moving film. There isn't many big action or thrilling scenes. There are some iconic visuals like the women jumping off the roof to hang herself, the priest spiked to the ground, or maybe the most iconic of all Damien on a tricycle. These are images that will be remember long after we're all gone. For that I would recommend this movie. It also doesn't hurt to have Gregory Peck.",The Omen
5,Hitchcoc,"So You Want to Have Kids, Eh!",9,22 December 2016,"This tale of the coming of the anti-Christ is incredibly captivating. What begins as a simple story of a man and his family, his wife and little boy, turns into a truly gripping film about a demon that is about to enter the world and hold sway. Gregory Peck plays the father and Lee Remick the mother of a little boy who is utterly evil. Of course, since we are all sane people, we don't believe there can be such a thing, and we go to the ends of the earth for our children. Damien, who is a precocious, but reckless kid takes his devil role very seriously. His father suspects something is wrong and goes about trying to figure things out. Meanwhile, Damien's mother is left alone with the little fellow. Eventually, things move to new heights and the violence comes. By the way, what an awesome choice for a musical score--""Carmina Burana.""",The Omen
6,mark.waltz,The real horror lies in what we don't see and what we fear about the future.,9,1 October 2014,"With the abundance of fear-pounding movies about demons, satanic creatures and theories of the world's ending (and Satan's take-over of it), classic movies like this sometimes are looked upon as pre-historic in comparison. The real issue is today that it seems that more than 50 percent of the movies coming out and T.V. series going on (and quickly off) the air are all about the fear that is the future of society as we would not like to know it.When ""The Omen"" first came out, it was unjustly compared to ""The Exorcist"" simply because of its sinister supernatural nature and the fact that it involved a child (Harvey Stevens). The two movies couldn't be any more different. In reflection, ""The Omen"" is a much better movie because its chills are real and the fear comes out of the unknown rather than silly gimmicks like throwing up pea soup. Here, priests are speared, nosy reporters slaughtered, and an innocent nanny is possessed by something which leads her to commit suicide in a ghastly manner. Wild animals in a wildlife park go ballistic just by the presence of an innocent child, and the mother, unaware that the child she has in her arms isn't hers, undergoes a series of horrors that are certainly a fate worse than death. Evil comes in the presence of the new nanny (Billie Whitelaw), one of the scariest looking servants since ""Rebecca's"" Mrs. Danvers.Damien's ""parents"" are the prominent Gregory Peck (an American ambassador overseas) and his gorgeous wife Lee Remick. They are happily married with the exception of the fact that she has been unable to have a child-until now. The well-meaning Peck doesn't want to break his wife's heart when their child is stillborn and takes in a child whose mother he has been told has died in childbirth. With piercing blue eyes, this baby boy is gorgeous, and grows into a beautiful child. But his destiny has been foretold and by the time Peck learns the truth, it is way too late and real horrors never heard of in a Grimm fairy tale begin to take over their lives.This is a suspenseful and horrific tale of what the book of Revelations has been warning us about for centuries. This is the beginnings of the life of who became world leader Carpathia in the best-selling ""Left Behind"" series, only told through a non-Christian perspective. The world has not yet gone through the rapture or any of the tribulations predicted by the book of Revelations. This is simply the story of a family whose structure is destroyed because of the element of evil accidentally dropped into its lap. An invisible evil presence is felt through Jerry Goldsmith's Oscar winning score, one of the spookiest in film history, and definitely appropriate to the sinister mood. It reminded me of the atmospheric middle-ages score by John Barry written for ""The Lion in Winter"".Of the sequels and remakes, only the second (and minimally, the third) really hold any interest when compared to this. While almost 40 years have gone by without any definitive sign of a possible anti-Christ living in our world, hints are always subtly revealed, leaving spooky parallels in world history. Today's films seem to be overstuffed with the glorification of this coming of evil, making the warnings of the initial ""Omen"" films easier to take on the souls because their message and motives were clear rather than indications that the writers of the newer films are welcoming this change in history with open hearts.",The Omen
7,kosmasp,Good boy (not),9,14 September 2021,"Of course you can apply that to the kid or the dog. If we're talking kid, I have to admit, the minimalistic approach (Damien does not really talk here) is really something that elevates the movie. Also do not expect this to be a ""gore fest""! The amount of violence is kept at a minimum - but if something happens, it is able to really get to you! There are a few scenes that while some might call or dismiss as jump scare (no pun intended), are very well planned out.In a sense you also have a ""using premonitions (pictures) to give a hint/clue as to what will happen to a character"". Something that was done quite well later on in the Final Destination movie series.Having Gregory Peck playing the main role may seem like a big deal in hindsight, but back then it seems like he was not really wanted that much (age wise). At times I had the impression he didn't feel too well ... uncomfortable even in his skin/character.While you can say and write a lot about the casting and the actors involved (very well assembled) there is a lot more to say about the music! Not just because it deservedly got the Oscar that year. This movie may have been one of the reasons Star Wars got made too ... and while you may consider the Exorcist the better horror movie, it does not mean you can only have one movie to rule them all.The pacing and some other things may have aged at least a little bit and may feel a bit odd nowadays, but effects overall work really good. Especially with the animals! Even if the makers themselves do not have the fondest memories of how they achieved their goals - they did a great job.Richard Donner is a great director - and he really shows it here too. And one that does not take himself too seriously as the audio commentaries reveal too. A classic for a reason! I'm about to (re)watch the rest of the series and the tv show this spawned - again no pun intended.",The Omen
8,gavin6942,A Quintessential Horror Film With Atmosphere,8,11 November 2012,"An American ambassador (Gregory Peck) learns to his horror that his son (Harvey Stephens) is actually the literal Antichrist.Some people have compared this film to ""The Exorcist"", another Satanic film released around the same time. Others have compared it to the remake (which, good or bad, owes its existence to this film). I have no interest in doing either.The film stands on its own merits, with the solid cast of Gregory Peck (a legend) and Lee Remick. David Warner, perhaps the last great horror actor, plays a significantly large role in the second half. And even the minor characters -- especially Father Brennan -- carry the picture. This is not to mention the director, Mr. Donner, whose carry only went up from here.What sells this film is the atmosphere. Jerry Goldsmith has an incredible score (those Latin chants are key). And even after going more than a decade without seeing the picture, the death scenes stood starkly in my mind as fresh as if they had just happened. This is one of the horror greats.",The Omen
9,lee_eisenberg,Devil went down to Italy,7,6 June 2005,"By now, it should be clear to movie fans that the really good trifecta of Devil-themed movies are ""Rosemary's Baby"", ""The Exorcist"" and ""The Omen"". An obvious point is that all three deal with children, but ""The Omen"" takes an interesting approach. Gregory Peck and Lee Remick play Robert and Katharine Thorn, American ambassadors to Italy. Their son, Damien, was born under unusual circumstances, but they still love him. Then, the bad news comes: Damien is literally the Antichrist. Not only is this boy pure evil, but he's not afraid to get rid of anyone whom he considers a threat, namely a pesky nanny.Okay, so maybe the whole movie is sort of improbable, but after you watch it, you likely won't look at little children as totally ""innocent"" anymore. Whereas ""The Exorcist"" drew most of its terror from the really gross scenes, ""The Omen"" draws its terror from what we don't know, from what may be creeping beneath the surface. Among other things, it was interesting to see Gregory Peck and Lee Remick, who were usually known for more ""serious"" roles, star in a horror movie. Chilling.",The Omen
10,jboothmillard,The Omen,9,16 March 2005,"This is the terrifying story about a boy named Damien who had many evil powers. His parents, father Robert Thorn (Gregory Peck) and mother Katherine Thorn (Lee Remick) assumed that things were happening by coincidence, but they weren't. For example, whenever the father drives Damien (Golden Globe nominated Harvey Stephens) past a church, Damien screams with fear (as the Devil would), so maybe Damien is a representation of the devil on earth, or his son. Keith Jennings (David Warner) is convinced that Damien is evil because of all the signs, or rather, all the ""omens"". The only way of stopping these things happening is to kill Damien, but obviously the father has loved him for too long he cannot find courage to do it. Also starring BAFTA nominated Billie Whitelaw as the evil Mrs. Baylock and Patrick Troughton as Father Brennan. A very terrifying film with some devilish parts, including Damien causing his mother to die, and of course, Warner's beheading scene with the sheet of glass, and a good ending. The moment where he sees the three 6's on Damien's head, representing the anti-Christ, is the true moment where Peck knows the evil son. There has been a legend since the film was made of a ""curse"" on many people involved in the making, e.g. the guy that helped make the beheading scene had a car crash approximately 6.66 miles from a town called Omene, was it coincidence, or was it the devil at work? It won the Oscar for Best Music for Jerry Goldsmith, and it was nominated for Best Song for Goldsmith's ""Ave Satani"". It was number 81 on 100 Years, 100 Thrills, it was number 9 on The 100 Greatest Scary Moments, and it was number 25 on The 50 Greatest British Films. Very good!",The Omen
11,Woodyanders,Worthy of its classic status,9,18 March 2009,"Ambitious American ambassador Robert Thorn (an outstanding and dignified performance by the inestimable Gregory Peck) begins to suspect that something is amiss with his adopted son Damien (well played by gifted child thespian Harvey Stephens) following a troubling series of odd and fatal ""accidents."" Thorn and cynical photographer Keith Jennings (the always excellent David Warner) embark on an investigation which takes them all over Europe in order to uncover the truth about Damien's possibly satanic origins.Director Robert Donner and screenwriter David Seltzer give the fantastic supernatural premise a semblance of plausibility by firmly grounding said story in a believable everyday world. Moreover, Donner maintains a steady pace throughout, keeps the tone resolutely creepy and serious (there's a welcome absence of any dumb and obtrusive humor), and stages a few elaborate murder set pieces with breathtaking go-for-it verve (an impalement on a huge spike and a stunning decapitation by a large runaway pane of glass are especially effective while a cheery young nanny happily hanging herself at a birthday party proves to be genuinely shocking and disturbing). Better still, the special effects are used in an admirably judicious manner and the picture overall primarily relies on developing and sustaining a potently unsettling gloom-doom mood to get under the viewer's skin. The tension gradually builds to a nerve-wracking fever pitch and culminates in a truly harrowing last third. The uniformly sterling acting by a first-rate cast qualifies as another major asset: Peck and Lee Remick as Torn's sweet, yet frail wife Katherine bring a tremendous amount of class to the film, Billie Whitelaw gives a positively chilling portrayal of sinister governess Ms. Baylock, Patrick Troughton excels as intense priest Father Brennan, and Leo McKern contributes a neat cameo as occult expert Carl Bugenhagen. Kudos are also in order for Gilbert Taylor's glossy cinematography and Jerry Goldsmith's supremely shivery'n'spooky Oscar-winning score. A superior mainstream horror hit.",The Omen
12,ccthemovieman-1,One Of Scariest Movies Of The Modern Era,10,8 June 2006,"This movie scared the heck out of me when I saw it in the theaters in 1976, and it's still creepy today. It was almost 30 years later when I finally saw it for the second time and I thoroughly enjoyed it again, although it wasn't terrifying to me anymore. The DVD version is excellent because it presents the movie in the 2.35 widescreen mode, which is essential to the viewing of this film if you are a fan of cinematography. A VHS formatted-to-TV picture would lose too much of the great camera-work done in this film. I was amazed how beautifully filmed this movie is, so if you love this film and don't have the DVD, please consider getting it.The story was a bit slower than I remembered it back in '76 but still provides enough action and plenty of chills. This time around, I found the nanny (Billie Whitelaw as ""Mrs. Baylock"") to be more scary than the devil/kid! I didn't even remember her from 30 years ago but she got my attention on the DVD. It was a very effective job of acting by that woman.In the meantime, I always enjoy looking at Lee Remick's gorgeous face with her magnetic eyes and Gregory Peck is usually rock-solid in roles he plays. This is no exception.Although I question some of the supposed quotes from the Book Of Revelation from the Bible (there is no ""s"" in Revelation, the screenwriters showing their biblical ignorance.), the movie is still a good witness to people who don't believe in Satan. They might after viewing this movie. This is one of the classics of the '70s and often underrated. The sequels to this were simply not memorable and not worth your time. I don't know about the re- make that just came out, but it would be tough to top this film. I think I'll stick with this one and I won't wait another 30 years to see it again. Maybe tonight!!",The Omen
13,rmax304823,A commercial bullseye.,4,13 March 2007,"""The Exorcist"" made an awful lot of money, so it was inevitable that there follow a spate of supernatural thrillers. This is one of the first, itself to be followed by I forget how many sequels and imitations.Suspenseful, gory, and thoroughly commercial, this slice of machine-processed turkey baloney was notable for a couple of reasons. Pretty stylish goings on, what with the Ambassador to the Court of St. James and all that. Well-known stars too, Peck and Lee Remick. And, finally, ""The Exorcist"" didn't have any violence to speak of but ""The Omen"" made up for it. Reviewers couldn't help commenting on the shocking violence. Poor David Warner. His head is not only lopped off by a sheet of glass but it rolls over and over like a bocce ball.It's hard to believe now that this was once considered a shockingly violent supernatural thriller. It's been overtaken by its own vulgarity. Subsequent film makers promptly deep sixed the supernatural element or minimized its importance. Since the point was to establish a cascade of gore -- period -- why shoot it in fancy, expensive locations? And let's get rid of the tiresome plot logic, which might cause someone to think? Let's just have evil incarnate. Give him fingers with scissors on the end and have him slice up nubile young girls on the screen. Or have a group of semi-naturals stumble into a farm run by a family of ghouls and maniacs. Nobody will notice the holes in the Swiss cheese plot because the entire plot will be one big hole. Nobody will care anyway.And nobody did.That said -- ""that"" being that commercial greed begets commercial greed -- this isn't bad as far as these things go. There are only four truly violent episodes and they're set up more carefully than we would now take for granted. The plot is still an attempt at a story. And the locations are neat and the acting not bad. David Warner is not too well cast. His angular, leptosomic form and horse face seem better suited to comedy or bitchery. The script doesn't help anyone. ""Have no fear, Little One. I am here to protect thee."" (""Thee""?) And the priest is afflicted with what might be called the gibberish syndrome. A person has some extremely important information to tell someone else and finally finds himself in a position to do it, within some tight time constraints. But instead of laying out the message linearly, he begins spouting gibberish. The priest doesn't say, ""You've adopted the anti-Christ."" His visage becomes that of a lunatic with red-rimmed eyes and he keeps chanting, ""Eat the body and drink the blood of Christ,"" over and over.Nice, shivery scene though when Peck and some other Nosy Parker are chased through a cemetery by a pack of savage Rottweilers with the hydrophobia dripping out of their jaws. The score is by Jerry Goldsmith, who did the splendid ""Chinatown."" In this case he resorts to the generic -- pounding drums, shrieking strings, a male chorus chanting ""Satanic"" verses -- like Karl Orff on mushrooms. Nothing, though, can lift it out of its own sump. The producers clearly designed the climax in a way that could lead to a sequel or sequels if there still seemed another nickel might be made out of it. That happened, pari passu. The originality and craftsmanship behind ""The Exorcist"" was long forgotten. How about this? We get rid of the human writers entirely and just program a computer to grind out variations on themes?",The Omen
14,Tweekums,Not particularly scary but still deserves to be considered a classic of the genre,8,24 April 2017,"At six o'clock on the sixth of June two children are born in Rome; one is born to the wife of American diplomat Robert Thorn but dies soon after birth, the other to a woman who dies during childbirth. A priest at the hospital suggests that Thorn takes the surviving child and raise him as his own without telling his mother.Time passes and Thorn is made Ambassador to the Court of St James. Everything goes well until the child, named Damien, is five when his nanny hangs herself in a very public manner. She is replaced by Mrs. Baylock, a sinister woman who claims to have been sent by the agency. Soon afterwards a priest tries to warn Thorn about his son; what he says sound like the ravings of a mad man; references to Revelations and prophecies about the arrival of the Antichrist! Soon afterwards the priest is killed in a freak accident and Thorn is approached by a photographer who has noticed strange shadows on pictures he had taken of the nanny and the priest that feature strange shadows that mirror the way they died. By now Thorn is very concerned so returns to Italy to discover the truth about his son meanwhile back in London his wife is in grave danger.This is a classic '70s horror film but don't expect it to be very scary. There are a few shocks and some mildly gory moments. This doesn't mean it isn't worth watching though; the story is solid and the cast is impressive. Gregory Peck does a fine job as Robert Thorn; especially towards the end as he learns the dreadful truth and realises what he must try to do. Lee Remick is also good as his wife, Billie Whitelaw is suitably sinister as Mrs. Baylock and David Warner impresses as the photographer. Harvey Spencer Stephens doesn't really have much to do as the young Damien but he certainly manages to smile in a creepy way. The film does show its age in places and certain things seem too unlikely; notably the Thorns failing to check up on Mrs. Baylock's references and the way Robert Thorn goes off to Italy then Israel without any of the protection one would expect a senior diplomat to have assuming he could get time off! The ending is a bit down beat but that does at least leave things open for the later films in the series. Overall I'd certainly recommend this to horror fans; especially those for like horror films inspired by religion.",The Omen

16,BA_Harrison,One hell of a movie.,10,4 May 2007,"After an American diplomat's son dies shortly after birth, he agrees to adopt an orphaned child, leaving his wife to believe that the substitute boy, Damien, is really her own. In reality, Damien is the AntiChrist, born of a jackal and deliberately placed with an influential family by Satan's acolytes in order for him to eventually become a powerful world leader.Richard Donner's superb Satanic horror classic is a thrilling, suspenseful and thoroughly absorbing tale, based on the end times prophecies of Christianity, as found in the Book of Revelation. A major studio film, with a brilliant cast, marvellous script, and an amazing Oscar-winning score by Jerry Goldsmith, The Omen is a movie that demands to be seen by all fans of the horror genre.Gregory Peck plays Robert Thorn, the poor sucker who is tricked into taking Damien into his home; Lee Remick is his wife who begins to suspect that the boy is not really hers. After Damien's nanny commits suicide (to be conveniently replaced by nasty Satanist, Mrs. Baylock, played perfectly by Billie Whitelaw), and Father Brennan (Patrick Troughton), a priest who tries to warn the diplomat that his son is the devil's offspring, dies in a gruesome freak accident, Thorn is contacted by Keith Jennings (David Warner), a photographer who has been investigating the bizarre events that have been occurring.Together, Thorn and Jennings delve deeper into the mystery and discover the shocking truth, and realise that the only way to end the horror is to ritually kill the evil child using seven special ceremonial daggers.With a subject matter that could easily have ended up as unintentionally funny in the hands of a lesser director, The Omen manages to be extremely creepy, very atmospheric and often very shocking. There are many standout macabre moments in the film, including Damien's refusal to enter a cathedral, a baboon attack at Windsor Safari Park and the oft-mentioned slow motion beheading scene, but it is Thorn and Jenning's visit to an ancient Etruscan cemetery that is the highpoint of the movie for me: after the heartbreaking discovery that Thorn's real son was actually murdered, we are treated to a great scene in which several dogs launch a vicious attack on the two men.Turn off the lights, light a few candles, crank up the sound (to make the most of the foreboding choral score), and have a devil of a time watching one of the best horror movies of all time.",The Omen
17,moonspinner55,"Better than most of the ""Exorcist"" rip-offs...",5,1 December 2002,"Wealthy Ambassador is told the baby his wife was carrying was delivered stillborn, and that yet another infant in the ward was born healthy but the mother died; he agrees to a secretive switch, but lives to regret it. Once ""The Exorcist"" took off, every studio in Hollywood had to cash in on the devil-cycle with stories of the occult. This one has a large budget (which accounts for its handsome, chilly-gray look) and a good cast, but it continually warns of frightening prophecies and then proceeds to throw outlandish killings at us. Poor Lee Remick suffers two different falls in a disgraceful bit of bad screen writing; Gregory Peck and David Warner fend off a pack of devil dogs at a cemetery in a battle which would've left them dead (here, they stagger away). The film clobbers the viewer with distress, with bodies piling up as if from a slasher movie (this film is really no different, it just has a slicker look). Gripping and occasionally suspenseful, but always in an unpleasant, distasteful way. Followed by an extremely woebegone batch of bad sequels. ** from ****",The Omen
18,dbdumonteil,the possessed child round 2,7,29 July 2006,"For a lot of cine buffs, the masquerade of ""the Exorcist"" (1973) was deemed ground-breaking enough to consider this enticing fantastic film to be a benchmark in the horror/fantasy genre but I'm not one of them. Three years later, ""the Omen"" steps into the breach William Friedkin's standard (for the ones who are fans of it) opened and the detractors of the film will surely qualify it as a pale mimicry of Friedkin's film, I will definitely choose Richard Donner's work which is perhaps the finest of all his career. A filmography often characterized by action-packed stories, the likes of the ""Lethal Weapon"" saga.So, Donner uses again some ingredients which made the success of ""the Exorcist"" like the child possessed by Satan who worries his surroundings and turns them to his advantage. First, it was a shrewd idea to have located the story in the American political milieu because it prepares the final sequence and the most famous one of the whole movie with sardonic humor: Damien holding the hand of the American president and grinning at him. Evil entering the White House and as the USA is the most powerful country in the world, the latter is in jeopardy. Apocalypse now indeed...As for the story, it is shot in a thrifty style. Would-be chilling special effects which plagued Friedkin's film and made it farcical weren't among Donner's priorities when he shot his film. So, special effects are kept to the minimum. It doesn't mean that ""the Omen"" is a total masterwork. Donner has a conspicuous taste for easy effects like the death of Damien's mother and his conventional directing sometimes stops the viewer from feeling shivers in some spooky sequences. Conventional could also be the most adequate epithet to deem the storyline as a whole. But these weaknesses don't handicap too much the thrill of the vision and as I said before: a ton of special effects wasn't Donner's priority and in spite of the scheduled dramatic progression, the film is eminently watchable.So ""the Omen"" is a more than valuable effort than its elder brother about the child haunted by Satan. If ""the Exorcist"" hadn't been created, maybe Donner's film could have had the stance of yardstick. And like its elder brother, this variation of the possessed child made crowds flock to it and caused a chain of cheesy sequels and even a remake which opened on the 06th June 2006 in the world. The choice of the date is evident. What about its quality? I will talk about it in my review devoted to it on this site.",The Omen
19,edwagreen,The Omen- That Nasty Little Brat! **1/2,6,25 September 2006,"The original and probably the best of the series dealing with the anti-Christ child who reeks havoc on the lives of his parents, presidential aspirant and ambassador, Gregory Peck and his lovely, but troubled wife-Lee Remick.As the child gets older, the woes of his parents worsen and why not. He was destined to destroy them to move closer to his ultimate goal of world control.As the sinister governess, Billie Whitelaw is excellent is conveying the emotion of an evil woman.The ending is quite predictable. Nobody allows a child to get stabbed to death under Hollywood standards.While adequate for the part, Peck seems uncomfortable when not acting in films of social consciousness. This film is more like social horror.",The Omen
20,Coventry,Enter the horror Hall of Fame...,8,11 October 2003,"Warning : Some things written directly below this can be seen as SPOILERS !!!The Omen is a great movie about the best and scariest possible topic ever. This movie really proves that horror is the most powerful genre in cinema...it contains the creepiest thriller moments and a good amount of touching drama. A horror role model and one of the better efforts in the genre ever. Made in 1976, The Omen had several groundbreaking aspects and it still stands after more than 25 years. Like its even more famous ""predecessor"" ( sort of ),The Exorcist uses the Christian Religion as a basic plot. If you add a few sensitive side aspects to that like child death, armageddon and politics I assure you'll be pinned to your screen for a good 110 minutes. Gregory Peck, although normally not a routine horror actor, gives away a terrific performance as Robert Thorn. He's an American ambassador who can't manage to tell his wife ( a good Lee Remick ) that their son died while giving birth. He accepts to adopt an orphan that was born on the same day and he decides never to tell his wife. When the boy - Damien - turns five, he's going through some...euh...changes ! It seems that Damien is the unmitigated Antichrist. The son of Satan himself, sent to the earth on 6am on the 6th day of the 6th month, to take over the world and to annihilate every quoin of the Christian belief. When it comes to atmosphere and tension, The Omen satisfies the most critic horror fan. The story develops itself like a sort of mystery that needs to be revealed. It's filled with surprises since you get the idea that nobody is safe in The Omen...You fear that every character can die at every moment and that fascinates you so much...The film isn't very bloody but that certainly doesn't bother you. The tension of it overrules the most beautiful gory scenes. And I have to mention the great use of music. I admit I am a sucker for loud, biblical and opera-like sounding music but I can't believe that someone is left cold with this music. The score leads in some of the most breath-taking scenes I've ever seen. Overall, The Omen is a must see and not strictly for horror fans. The whole myth about the Antichrist and his birthmark - IF it is a myth of course...- is one of the best stories ever written. Favorite ""rewind""-scenes : If can't decide between these two so I'll add them both to this review...The first one is at Damien's birthday party. The party gets brutally interrupted by the nanny. She's standing on the roof and what follows is one of the most surprising and unexpected scenes of terror ever seen. Second one...Allow me to tell you that The Omen contains the greatest decapitation scene EVER !!! You'll know it when you see it !",The Omen
21,Theo Robertson,Much Better Than THE EXORCIST,8,10 January 2005,"This movie appears in the book 50 Worst Movies Of All Time alongside such fare as ROBOT MONSTER . This is completely undeserved because i rate THE OMEN as one of the best horror movies from the 1970s , if not all time . The book in question makes a big deal of how young Damien's parents experience some ghastly going ons without realising something is seriously wrong , but this is churlish since the audience ( like in most horror movies ) are one step in front of the protagonists , we instantly know what's going on even if the characters on screen don't and this is what makes the narrative so suspenseful , we're waiting for Ambassador Robert Thorn to put two and two together . It should also be pointed out that these types of tradgedies do happen in life and there's a rational explanation with no supernatural causes involvedComparisons with both THE OMEN and THE EXORCIST will be made but this is by much the better film I think . Both films deal with satanic powers and both are very dead pan but unlike THE EXORCIST the serious tone of this movie doesn't go against it , THE EXORCIST goes out of its way to shock the audience while THE OMEN keeps its discipline and is all the better for it . Richard Donner brings shock moments where it's needed like the revelation of the priest after the fire , the scene in the cemetery and the lorry accident at Megiddo and unlike the shock scenes in THE EXORCIST they're never unintentionally funny . Giving roles to well known Brit character actors like Patrick Troughton , Billie Whitelaw , Leo McKern and David Warner also helps the movie a lot The only real criticism I have is that it's not as good as I originally remembered after seeing it for the first time , but that's a problem with a great number of movies I've seen , or that the biblical city of Megiddo is nowhere near the location described in the screenplay ( It is in fact a few short miles west of the border of the West Bank on the route to Jenin ) but that won't matter to 99.9% of the rest of the audience . If I ever write a book called 50 Best Horror Movies Of All Time THE OMEN will definitely feature in it",The Omen
22,Hey_Sweden,666! The number of the beast!,8,18 November 2018,"Inspired by the Book of Revelations, this horror classic still stands tall as having established a genuine brand name in the subgenre of religion-themed horror. It has a grandiose, operatic quality, all enhanced by Jerry Goldsmiths' over the top, thunderous, Oscar-winning score, and has the distinction of boasting elaborate death set pieces, the kinds of things later heavily emulated in the ""Final Destination"" film series.It also boasts a stellar cast: Gregory Peck (""Gentleman's Agreement""), all warmth and affability, plays Robert Thorn, an American diplomat in Rome whose infant son has died. Rather than tell his wife Katherine (the radiant Lee Remick, ""Anatomy of a Murder"") the sad truth, he agrees to a proposal from a priest, Father Spoletto (Martin Benson): swap another newborn for the dead child. And this other kid grows to the age of five (now played by adorable Harvey Stephens), but Katherine has her doubts about this kid, even more so when bizarre deaths happen. Thorn and a photographer named Jennings (David Warner, ""Time After Time"") do some investigating into the matter of the childs' parentage, and learn some pretty horrifying things.""The Omen"" still packs a delicious punch 42 years later, announcing the arrival of a versatile director, Richard Donner, in a major way. For the most part, he'd only done television beforehand. Donner directs with a great flair for spectacle, and also gives ""The Omen"" excellent pace: although it runs close to two hours, it never drags, and is always interesting. It has wonderful atmosphere, especially in a sequence set in an abandoned ruin of a cemetery in Italy; here is where Thorn and Jennings finally find some answers, while devil dogs mill about in the background and soon go on the attack.Those aforementioned death set pieces are fantastic, although in general they're more simply done than the killings in the ""Final Destination"" films that this viewer also brought up. What is likely to be the highlight of ""The Omen"" for some people is the strange decapitation that occurs fairly close to the end of the picture. And yet, there is really not that much gore on hand.Peck delivers an engaging performance as this ambitious politico who becomes more distraught as he wises up to the reality of his desperate situation. Remick has less to do, but still comes across fine as the wife / ""mom"" who eventually begins to fear this unholy spawn. Warner provides some efficient support, and Billie Whitelaw (""Start the Revolution Without Me"") is wonderful as the subtly sinister nanny who appears to take charge of little Damien. Patrick Troughton (the second 'Doctor Who') and Mr. Benson (""Goldfinger"") are superb as the priests complicit in the baby swap five years ago. Leo McKern (""A Man for All Seasons"") has an uncredited cameo as Bugenhagen, who gives Thorn all-important instructions late in the picture; Jack Palances' daughter Holly (""The Best of Times"") is the ill-fated nanny, and Canadian actor Nicholas Campbell (""The Dead Zone"") makes his film debut in a bit as a Marine guard.""The Omen"" is one of those films that just builds in intensity as it goes along, taking its audience on a doom-laden, macabre ride that they don't soon forget.Eight out of 10.",The Omen
23,Doylenf,Some spellbinding moments but not totally credible...,6,30 August 2006,"For an effective chiller that has several well-executed scenes of horror, THE OMEN moves at too leisurely a pace under Richard Donner's direction. GREGORY PECK and LEE REMICK are a good pair as the parents of a little boy who turns out to be the Anti-Christ, a fact they slowly become aware of after a number of strange things start happening. The sequences where he raises the Devil, so to speak, are the most harrowing in the whole tale--but happen after too many talky moments take away some of the interest.HARVEY STEPHENS plays the malicious youngster (his blond hair dyed black) and his efforts resulted in a Golden Globe nomination as Best Actor in a Debut Role. But oddly enough, he soon disappeared from the screen and today is a successful businessman in London. However, Jerry Goldsmith's fascinating background score did win him a well-deserved Oscar for Best Scoring of a Dramatic Film.BILLIE WHITELAW is also effective as the boy's nanny, who is anything but a Mary Poppins type. She too was highly acclaimed for her sinister interpretation of a woman who has already made her own pact with the Devil.None of it is altogether convincing, but it sustains interest with its interesting camera-work and location filming. Peck is rather low-key and somber in the lead, but David WARNER as a photographer friend does nicely in a thankless supporting role and LEE REMICK does her usual fine work.Chilling stuff, perhaps a bit tame by today's standards, but worth a look.",The Omen
24,preppy-3,One of the better horror films,8,4 December 2006,"Robert Thorn (Gregory Peck) is the American ambassador to England. His wife Katharine (Lee Remick) gives birth to a baby who is born dead. Without letting her know Thorn switches her baby with another whose mother died while giving birth. Things are fine until Damien (Harvey Stephens) turns five. Then people start dying and Peck realizes that little Damien may be the Antichrist.HUGE hit in 1976. I saw it when I was 14 at a theatre. I remember liking it but being disappointed. It had an R rating so I expected a much bloodier picture than what I saw. Seeing it again my feelings have changed a little. It still is a very good film and it really doesn't need blood and gore to tell it's story...but I now find it slow and uninvolving. Everyone knows the ending by now and for a film that runs almost two hours that's not good. Still it is worth seeing.The direction by Richard Donner is great (he really knows how to use a widescreen); Remick and Peck are excellent (although I do wonder how they got them to agree to do a horror film); the deserved Oscar-winning score by Jerry Goldsmith helps the film immensely; the script is good and Billie Whitlaw is downright terrifying as Mrs. Baylock--the scene where she goes after Remick in the hospital has always scared me silly.The deaths are inventive (to put it mildly) but very bloodless. Even when Jennings (David Warner) gets his head cut off there's next to no blood. Also that's the best part of the picture--the effect is convincing, the music is pounding and Peck's reaction is realistic.So this is a little slow but the writing, acting, direction and music more than make up for that. I give it an 8.",The Omen

26,CinemaSerf,"Tattoos, torture and a goldfish bowl...",7,7 November 2021,"OK, so at times this is a bit far-fetched, even for a horror movie, but I reckon it is still my favourite from the genre made in the 1970s. From a rather murky start in a Roman hospital, we see Gregory Peck and wife Lee Remmick head to London where he is to be US Ambassador - along with their new baby sone ""Damien"" (cue the squeaking violins). Not long after their arrival, their nanny commits suicide - rather gruesomely, as it happens - facilitating the arrival of ""Mrs. Baylock"" (a rather menacing Billie Whitelaw). As their son ages, and fuelled by some rather ghastly prophesies by Patrick Troughton's ""Father Brennan"", Peck slowly concludes that there is something a little dodgy about his son. Thing is, can he thwart the evil contained within the young boy? Richard Donner does well to build and to sustain a sense of peril from pretty much the outset of this film - aided, ably, by a Jerry Goldsmith score that uses maniacal choral vocals and strings to keep you behind the sofa. Peck isn't at his best, and some of the scenes - especially in the graveyard with the Baskervillian hounds - do stretch the imagination, but for the most part it seizes your attention and keeps it. I have to admit to being disappointed by the ending - just why did the police give chase?",The Omen
27,poolandrews,This kid's a little devil... Classic demonic horror from the 70's that has stood the test of time pretty well.,7,23 September 2005,"The Omen starts in 'Rome June 6th - 6AM' where the rich & powerful Robert Thorn (Gregory Peck) is told by Father Spiletto (Martin Benson) that his recently born son is dead, that his wife Katherine (Lee Remick) is not aware of it yet & that a replacement new born baby is ready if he wants it. Thorn accepts the offer & brings the boy Damien (Harvey Stephens) up as if he was his own, shortly after Thorn is appointed the American ambassador of England where he & his family move. However, when Damien turns the age of five things start to turn somewhat nasty. Holly (Holly Palance), Damien's nanny, decides to commit suicide by hanging herself in front of Thorn & his guests. A vicious Rottweiler starts hanging around the Thorn estate, Father Brennan (Patrick Troughton) pays Thorn a visit & desperately tries to warn him of his son, Damien freaks out whenever he goes anywhere near a church, Katherine becomes pregnant but loses the baby in an 'accident' & they hire the nanny from hell Mrs. Baylock (Billie Whitelaw). A nosey photographer named Keith Jennings (David Warner) starts to dig a little & becomes aware of the strange goings-on, he contacts Thorn & as they investigate they slowly arrive at a theory that they may be dealing with the Antichrist himself...Directed by Richard Donner The Omen is a classic horror that plays well even today, two decades after it's initial release. The script by David Seltzer is a little slow in places but still managed to engage & interest me throughout, the character's are strong & as a whole the story & plotting are solid. The little kid Damien looks real evil but is barely in the film & most of the running time is spent on Thorn trying to figure out what's going on. The Omen was made in 1976 & has dated extremely well, both in terms of story & it's overall look without many hideous 70's hairdo's & clothes to date it. Director Donner does a good job at building the tension & considering the small sounding $2,800,000 budget The Omen is remarkably well made. The fantastic decapitation scene is one of the best ever committed to film although the rest of the violence in The Omen is disappointingly tame by comparison. The cinematography is great, very classy & stylish. Jerry Goldsmith won an Oscar for his brilliant music & as a whole The Omen has very nice production values & a polished feel throughout. The acting is strong by a good cast, apparently Charlton Heston, Roy Scheider & William Holden all turned down the leading role eventually taken by veteran actor Gregory Peck who hadn't worked prior to The Omen for five years & took a cut in salary, make of that what you want... Overall I liked The Omen, it makes for good entertainment & it has a certain greatness about it. Worth watching just for that cool decapitation scene & Jerry Goldsmith's score alone...",The Omen
28,utgard14,Worth a Look,7,2 November 2013,"The Omen is an intriguing horror movie with several creepy moments and novel death scenes. It borrows from The Exorcist and Rosemary's Baby but offers enough on its own to overlook that. Richard Donner's direction is very good and a cast led by vets Gregory Peck and Lee Remick does a fine job with sometimes schlocky material. Some of the impact and shock of certain scenes has been lessened by time, as one might expect. But the overall intensity of the film holds up well I think. There are some points where the film drags and the overall resolution to the story is a tad predictable. Not the specifics exactly but the tone; I knew halfway through it would be one of those movies that ends ""that way."" I think you'll realize what I mean as you watch it.

If it goes to deep into rare unheard of religious theories then I'll usually turn it off. I saw parts of this movie as a kid. It was because of this movie that for years I thought Damien was another word for Satan or the devil. That little boy made me shudder.This was a creepy movie. A lot better than Rosemary's Baby though the concepts are very similar. The casting in this one was good even though I'm not a fan of Gregory Peck. He's too theatrical. Like every line has to be delivered with the utmost emphasis and diction. It's a movie not the stage. His acting style was more suitable for the 50's and 60's but I think acting and movies went through a conversion in the 70's.Take this movie for instance-no way would this movie have been made in the 50's and 60's. The 70's is when you started to see more nudity, more violence, more foul language, and more risqué topics. Cowboys and Indians were replaced by cops and criminals. The monsters like Dracula, Frankenstein, and the creature from the Black Lagoon were replaced by Leatherface, the devil, and demons.

Director Richard Donner layers the moments of truly gnarly gruesome killings (Warner's doomed photographer is destined as one of the best on screen offings and thanks to the miracle of stop-frame & rewind you'll be thrilled to know it's really gross and truly unsettling) and the bone-chilling score by composing vet Jerry Goldsmith copped a richly deserved Oscar.",The Omen
32,evanston_dad,"Gregory Peck, What Hath Thou Wrought?",7,28 August 2007,"I usually prefer my horror to be of the psychological, creepy variety, but even though the approach taken in ""The Omen"" is to bludgeon you with shock effects, it's still one damn scary movie.Gregory Peck classes up this movie mightily just by being in it, and he does tremendous work as Roger Thornhill, a U.S. senator who becomes the unwitting father to Damien, aka the AntiChrist. Most of the movie is focused on Thornhill's reluctance to accept the overwhelming case laid out against his son, and then the hair-raising finale finds him dragging Damien to a church to do away with him before the authorities, who of course don't know the true nature of the circumstances, can stop him.""The Omen"" is staged as a series of outrageous scare scenes, many of them revolving around the death of someone it's more convenient to Damien not to have around. Thus his nanny hangs herself at his birthday party, leaving the door open for a mysterious and much more sinister nanny to appear and take care of him. A priest who's on to some of what's going on gets skewered by a church steeple. Damien's own mother (Lee Remick) takes a tumble, first off a second story balcony and then out of a hospital window. And in the film's most famous scene, a photographer who has been unraveling the mystery of who Damien is is beheaded by a sheet of glass.But the film's not all schlock effects. It's well written and paced, and the screenwriters take a wise approach to the material -- it's as much mystery as it is horror film. And there's something hugely creepy about the fact that Damien isn't directly responsible for any of the film's black magic. He's too young yet to know what he is or what power he has, and there are demonic forces around him that are making sure he stays protected, but which we the audience never see. In this way, ""The Omen"" is far scarier to me than ""The Exorcist,"" which treats the subject of demonic possession so literally.I'd put this in my list of top ten scariest films.Grade: A",The Omen

Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that this was a decent film concerning Biblical prophecy on the topic of the Anti-Christ. Unfortunately, as is so often the case, the writers (in this case David Seltzer) typically add some extremely ridiculous scenarios which go well beyond anything ever mentioned in the Bible. For example, this film goes to great lengths to depict the mother of the Anti-Christ as being a jackal. I'm not kidding.

However, seen today, the movie's effectiveness has sharply worn off. To a degree, the movie is still interesting in that it gets you curious enough to watch until the end to see what happens. But there are a number of flaws along the way that are very distracting. The fact that the movie is about the antichrist, yet gives this figure a limited amount of screen time (and even less to actually do) might have been forgiven had the narrative been better constructed. The narrative is strange in the fact that it simultaneously seems much too long and stretched out for its own good, yet at the same time is seemingly missing many plot details that would have made things a lot clearer. Many viewers might also be disappointed that while the movie was rated ""R"" at the time, the (limited) amount of horror is quite tame by today's standards.

Gregory Peck and Lee Remick plays Robert and Katherine Thorn, Ambassadors to Great Britain. After his son is pronounced dead he is convinced to adopt a boy named Damien. Strange occurrences follow including the hanging death of the nanny and the impalement of a priest who attempted to warn Thorn that his son is really the Anti-Christ. Grand first feature by Richard Donner with a screenplay full of Biblical lore. Peck is a strong presence as Thorn, attempting to understand what he is dealing with while everything falls apart. He is soon presented with several daggers to seal the deal. Remick's emotional state shatters until her unborn child dies in a innovative fall from a railing. David Warner plays a photographer caught up in the search for answers when strange marking appear on photos. Harvey Stephens plays the weak yet menacing child Anti-Christ. The one flaw would be the awkward behavior of Billie Whitelaw as the replacement nanny. Actions such as bringing in a dog unannounced or questioning the authority of the Thorns should have warranted her termination.

36,kannibalcorpsegrinder,A Classic in every sense of the word,10,1 May 2015,"Following the birth of his son, a US diplomat in London gradually begins to suspect something is wrong with him and when the demonic truth is thrust upon him he resolves to put an end to it to save the world.This here is an unmitigated classic that still holds up well to this day. A lot of this is due to the fact that the film manages to mix the classy approach with far more appropriate horror dealings, and that leaves this one very nicely in combining those two within this. The general air to this one, from its grandiose atmosphere to the star-power and it's respectability all manage to scream out about its origins and big-budget background, and they do tend to help this out in terms of building the horror. The travel to the church and the rather chilling encounter in the cemetery does manage to incorporate a rather suspenseful air to this while still employing a far classier edge that doesn't betray those horror angles since this one is firmly in the belief that this is still a horror film. That keeps this one building a rather tense tone throughout this by continuing to keep it's scenes rooted quite firmly in the genre so scenes like the cemetery attack, reputable not only for truly revealing the story but also the savage action of the dog attacks jumping all over them while savagely barking and yelling the whole time in a truly masterful scene and echoes the baboon attack earlier which is just as much fun. There's a lot of these types of scenes throughout the film, from the chase in the park to the church ambush following that as well as the birthday party scene which is all sorts of chilling here in front of the kids present as well as the finale where he has to come face-to-face with all the evil forces finally at full-force against him which is all sorts of fun while mixing in some chilling elements to this. That's where this one really gets a lot of positive points and might actually be the best part of this one where all the actions within this one feel creepier than they really should due to the fact that it's a horror effort, from the gradual dawning of his status to the camera play showcasing their future fates as well as the ruse about the adoption all creating a sinister air here. While this one does take a little too long to get going and spell itself out, it's not enough of a detriment with the positives here.Rated R: Graphic Violence, Language, children in danger and mild, off- screen animal violence.",The Omen

38,Aaron1375,Very chilling tale of the Antichrist.,8,30 July 2009,"I read another comment on this movie saying that it is in a book of the 50 worst films ever...how is that possible? This movie is very well done and one of the better horror movies of the 1970's in that it has a rather interesting story and a really good evil little child. The story has a husband and wife experiencing the loss of their child, I think it was during pregnancy or shortly thereafter. Thankfully (well not really thankfully) a man comes and lets the man have a child that is apparently an orphan or something. Well they take the kid and raise him as their own...not sure, but the mother may have been unaware that her child died, but do not quote me on that. Well during a birthday party there nanny quits in very extreme fashion, but she still shows a soft side for Damien (the little boy now about four) and they have to hire a new nanny and they get a great new dog too. Well before you know it strange things begin to happen as a reporter and a priest begin to realize something is wrong and it is not to long before the father suspects something is up with his son as well. Nice movie, a couple of good kills and that creepy music that accompanies all satanic horror movies to really make for a good atmosphere and mood. The sequels would not be nearly as good or effective, however they are both much better than the Exorcist sequels.",The Omen
39,safenoe,This ain't Child's Play,7,13 August 2017,"I rated this 7, which is 6.66 rounded up.Anyway, this movie ain't child's play, and much has been written about The Omen. When I first watched it, I thought ""omen"" meant something awful or negative. But ""omen"" is a neutral word but thanks to this scary motion picture, we associate it with a 666 kid-running-amok. Anyway, after the movie screened, I can imagine parents nervously checking for 666 marks on their kids' scalps and re-familiarizing themselves with the Book of Revelation. But a word of caution for parents in this predicament...the 666 may in fact be 999, as the absence of an underline on the kid's scalp may confuse things, and a 999 kid is innocent.",The Omen
40,The_Void,A horror masterclass,9,23 December 2004,"Following on from The Exorcist, The Omen is a horror film that gained itself instant notoriety for it's dissection of Christian theology to create a horror movie. However, despite it's many macabre incidents and dark mythology, The Omen is actually a family drama. The focus is always kept on the family at the centre of the story, and fatherly love makes up the backbone of the story, while also creating much of the horror. That's what puts this film above many other horror films of a similar nature; it creates it's scenario first, completes it with interesting characters that you can relate to and care for, and then it adds the horror; by which point it is all the more powerful, owing to the fact that the audience has some feeling for the characters. Horror works much better when it has backbone and emotion behind it, and The Omen proves that. Of course, the fact that The Omen is more than technically sound isn't exactly incidental to the film's success with horror and art fans alike, as this film features fabulous directing, some great acting and an intelligent, mature script. And, despite the fact that movie is largely story based, we are still treated to some glorious gory highlights, which include a spire being flung through a priest, and what is maybe the best decapitation ever filmed.Gregory Peck, who gives one of his all time best performances, stars as Robert Thorn; the American ambassador in Britain whose wife had a still born baby. Unbeknown to her, Thorn decides, on the recommendation of a priest that is present, to take the child of another family as his own. However, things go awry for the family when it turns out that this child is the Antichrist. The name 'Damien' is more famous than the movie itself. Damien is absolutely perfect name for this movie as despite being an everyday, ordinary name; it has a true horror ring to it. Owing to this film, if there really was an Antichrist; I would expect him to be called Damien. The film is topped off by a great score, which is very over the top, but it works magnificently nonetheless. The theme song that plays over the opening credits is incredible and belongs right near the summit of the list of best themes ever composed for a movie. Religion has proved itself on many occasions to make a great subject for a horror movie, and it has more than done it in this film. It takes obvious influence from earlier seventies horrors, such as The Exorcist, but it does it in an original way and the result is one of the greatest horror movies ever made.",The Omen
41,Sylviastel,A Terrific Horror Film!,10,20 November 2001,"The Omen is one of my favorite films of all time. You cannot have a better cast than Lee Remick, Gregory Peck, Billie Whitelaw CBE in her best role as the hellish nanny, and David Warner. Harvey Stephens gives a terrifying performance as the young boy, Damien. IT's worth viewing, it's a must see for anybody who believes in the paranormal like myself. Although the story behind the film offers quite a fascinating look at the possibility that it may have been cursed in the first. You know the saying that art replicates life. Now that they have remade it with Liev Schrieber and Julia Stiles for the 30th anniversary of the first film, nothing comes close or better to the original. It's still one of my favorite horror films of all time. They replaced Whitelaw's Mrs. Baylock with Mia Farrow which is kind of a genius casting call since she was Rosemary in Rosemary's Baby, another classic thriller. The original beats any remake because the cast is just excellent, Lee Remick and Gregory Peck are truly believable as an older couple in love and wanting a family. Harvey Stephens is just perfect as Damien. And of course, the other cast members, the wonder Billie Whitelaw best known for her performances in Samuel Beckett plays, David Warner as the photographer, and Rumpole's own Leo McKern as the archaeologist in Israel. I just wished that I saw what the original mother looked like even toward the end of the film.",The Omen
42,siderite,Devilish marketing,7,11 June 2006,"I seem to remember the movie from my childhood as a smart, intriguing and scary film. Apparently, I was very impressionable back then. Now, all I could see are ""controversial"" ideas used as a means of marketing the movie. Of course, you can't really call them clichés, as they were used for the first or second time, but now the plot seems ""just another devil movie"".Of course, back in 76 you had no real visual effects, you had to rely on actors really playing their part. I think Gregory Peck did a good job. I continue to dislike Lee Remick as I did in childhood, so I didn't really cry when she died. I even liked the dogs. I should check my hair these days.Anyway, the atmosphere is rather well created, mad priests screaming nonsense and all, but then you could sell something like this. I will watch parts 2 3 and 4 these days and come up with more comments on movies.Conclusion: it is rather difficult to watch these days, it certainly employs film methods that are now obsolete, but it is a good movie, a bit above average. It might be interesting to compare with the 2006 remake.",The Omen
43,JamesHitchcock,The Number of the Beast,6,15 July 2009,"The number 666 (the so-called ""Number of the Beast"") has traditionally been associated with all things diabolical, so I thought this film would be a suitable subject for my 666th review for IMDb.At one time supernatural horror films normally dealt with assorted monsters, vampires, ghosts and things that go bump in the night, but in the sixties and seventies the fashion arose for what might be called the theological horror film, dealing with such matters as Satanism, demonic possession and the end of the world. ""Rosemary's Baby"" and ""The Exorcist"" are films of this type, and ""The Omen"" is another in the same tradition.The central character, Robert Thorn, is very much a part of the American establishment- scion of a wealthy old-money family, a close friend of the President and his country's Ambassador to Italy. While they are living in Rome, Robert's wife Katherine gives birth to a stillborn child, and he is persuaded to adopt a baby born on the same night in the same hospital, and whose mother died in childbirth. They name the child Damien, a name presumably chosen because of its closeness to ""demon"". Soon afterwards Thorn is appointed US Ambassador to Great Britain- Italian viewers may not be pleased to note that in the movie this is regarded as a promotion- and moves with Katherine and young Damien to London.As Damien grows up, however, he becomes the focus of a series of strange and unsettling events, including the suicide of his nanny at his fifth birthday party. Thorn is warned by a priest that his adopted son is in fact the Antichrist, the son of Satan himself. At first he dismisses the man's warnings as the ravings of a lunatic, but later begins to suspect that there may be some truth in them, especially after the priest dies in a bizarre accident. Desperate to find out the truth, Thorn visits Rome and Israel with a photographer named Keith Jennings and realises that Damien is indeed the Antichrist.From a technical point of view, the film is well-made. This was Richard Donner's first major film and he showed the abilities he was later to bring to other action films such as ""Superman"" and the ""Lethal Weapon"" series. The action sequences are well handled and contribute to a growing sense of tension; only occasionally, as in the scene where Jennings is decapitated in a freak accident, do the rather primitive seventies special effects show through. This scene was clearly intended to be horrific, but today it comes across as inadvertently comic. The look of the film is dull and autumnal, regardless of the ostensible time of year, with a muted colour scheme, and this adds to its sinister atmosphere, as does Jerry Goldsmith's musical score.Gregory Peck was not the first choice to play Thorn- the producers originally wanted Charlton Heston in the role- but he plays it so well that one cannot imagine any other actor in the part. Thorn is similar to some other Peck characters, such as Atticus Finch in ""To Kill a Mockingbird"" and Sam Bowden in ""Cape Fear"" in that he is a decent, liberal man suddenly confronted with the problem of evil, except that Thorn is confronted with evil in its purest form and with a dilemma- whether or not to kill his adopted son- even more stark than anything which confronted Finch or Bowden. There is another very good performance from Billie Whitelaw as the sinister Mrs Blaylock, who becomes Damien's new nanny after the suicide of her predecessor and quickly becomes his guardian angel. Or rather his guardian devil, as she is a servant of Satan sent to protect the boy form harm.My reservations about this film are largely theological. My own religious position is a liberal one, and although I believe in the existence of God I do not believe in the literal existence of the Devil who is, at most, a representation in symbolic form of man's capacity for evil, not some sort of rival god. I am normally prepared to suspend my scepticism about supernatural phenomena in the interests of good entertainment; I have never, for example, allowed the fact that I do not believe in witchcraft to spoil my enjoyment of the Harry Potter films. I tend, however, to make an exception in the case of films which ask me to accept the literal existence of Satan, or which preach that the end of the world is nigh, and there is a reason for this.A literalistic interpretation of the Book of Revelation as a prophecy of a coming Armageddon has always struck me as a hallmark of the most reactionary and intolerant sort of Christianity, the sort which is always more ready to hate one's enemies than to forgive them and which finds it easy to identify the Antichrist with whichever enemy (the Pope, Muslims, the United Nations, whoever) is at the top of that particular sect's hate-list. I doubt if the makers of this film made it with the explicit purpose of furthering a Christian fundamentalist agenda; a much more likely motive was to emulate the financial success of ""The Exorcist"", which had been one of the biggest films of 1973. Nevertheless, I feel that that is the sort of agenda which this film, and others like it, may well inadvertently further. 6/10",The Omen
44,Smells_Like_Cheese,"A big step up from ""Rosemary's Baby"" and a little baby step away from ""The Exorcist""",8,15 November 2004,"I thought ""The Omen"" was a fantastic movie. The thrills and intensity was very exciting. I thought this was way better than ""Rosemary's Baby"". This had a little more to get from. The acting is phenomenal. The story is very cool and original. It is also very frightening. It's a great thriller from the 70's. I would highly recommend this. For anyone. You could be a fan from ""The Exorcist"". Or just love horror fans. It is practically a must for those fans. There are some moments that were a little boring. And the ending didn't satisfy me. Not like ""The Exorcist"" did anyways. But it is still a great movie. Watch it alone in the dark. You'll get the full effect.8/10",The Omen

It's more chilling and freaky and subtle. There isn't any fake pea soup here, either. Which isn't to say that ""The Exorcist"" isn't any good - but it hasn't fared as well over the years.""The Omen"" is just really good. It was released the same year as Exorcist if I'm not mistaken and Gregory Peck gives a fine performance. The part where a character's head is lopped off and rolls across a street in slow-motion, and then director Richard Donner cuts to a whole new sequence, is really chilling and bizarre.It's that sort of eerie unexplained stuff that makes this, in my opinion, superior to a lot of the other stuff out there - i.e. many other trashy supernatural flicks that don't hold anything against this.",The Omen
46,Red-Barracuda,A solid bit of big budget 70's religious-themed horror,7,31 January 2014,"In Rome, an American diplomat's wife has a stillborn baby. He secretly swaps another from a woman who died in birth. Unfortunately for him, this child is the spawn of Satan.This was the third in the big three satanic themed horror movies released by the Hollywood studios; The Omen falls somewhere between the other two, Rosemary's Baby and The Exorcist. It doesn't have the subtlety of the former but is a lot more restrained than the latter. It's probably the most obviously mainstream of the three, although in fairness all three were smash hits at the box office. They all share the scary idea of the ultimate evil being channelled through the vessel of a child. This one, alongside Rosemary's Baby, is more specifically about the birth of the Antichrist but where Rosemary's Baby ends with the birth of the child, The Omen begins with this event. In doing so, we focus our attention on the impact of the child as opposed to the mother's pregnancy as we did in Roman Polanski's film. This change basically opens the door for a less restrained film, with the depiction of a variety of violent supernatural events that follows in the wake of the Antichrist on Earth. In this sense, it's a film where inventive macabre set-pieces play an important role. In particular, the death scenes stay firmly in the mind. We have a particularly haunting scene where the boy's first nanny hangs herself in front of the guests at a large garden party, later on there are a couple of elaborate death scenes where a man is impaled by a falling church spire during a storm and another where a photographer is decapitated by a sheet of glass. These latter two sequences typify the kind of inventively violent deaths that would make up the large part of the subsequent sequels. In this first instalment they are integrated into a plot with a greater emphasis on story development. A lot of the focus is on the boy's 'father' and his initial reluctance to believe the truth and his subsequent return to Italy to discover the horrific facts behind Damien's birth. This results in some interesting, sinister moments such as the scene in the ancient Etruscan graveyard where the body of the boy's mother is found. So The Omen is a good mix of the atmospheric and violent horror strands.The high production values in this one are fairly obvious. There's location shooting in Italy, Britain and Israel. A cast led by the A-Lister Gregory Peck and with fine support work from several others including ex Doctor Who actor Patrick Troughton as a troubled priest, David Warner as a photographer whose pictures reveal strange and ominous hidden supernatural imagery and, best of all, Billie Whitelaw as the very sinister nanny Mrs Baylock. Additionally, child actor Harvey Stephens is suitably creepy as young Damien. While it would be seriously remiss to not mention composer Jerry Goldsmith's sterling contribution, seeing as his score is one of the best things about the movie - its sinister choirs all the way in a very dramatic soundtrack. The focused direction from Richard Donner holds everything together resulting in a very solid film indeed. It was followed by a couple of entertaining sequels that carried on the story in a pretty satisfactory fashion.",The Omen
47,Rainey-Dawn,"Im-""Peck""-able Film",10,4 March 2016,One of the greatest horror films of all time. This one still gives me the shivers when I watch it. If you a fan of horror films and have not seen the original Omen (1976) then by all means find a copy of it to watch - you will not be disappointed. I highly recommend this movie.The casting in incredible - everyone is believable. Harvey Stephens as Damien is just amazing... most child actors are not that grand but Harvey is simply fantastic.The musical scoring by Jerry Goldsmith is just as haunting as the film itself. The directing and the story - the story - will leave chills within you for days after watching this one.What I like best about this film is the fact there is little gore in it. It's just a darn good story - lots of psychological thrills and horrors with just a handful on camera graphic scenes - just enough to keep it terrifying without over doing it.

49,thesar-2,A Damien Child is Born,7,30 July 2017,"If not for Mom, Dad & Donner, The Omen would've just come across as capitalizing on The Exorcist. Yes, I know the horror trend back in the early to mid-70s (or all of the 1970s?) was Religious horror. I guess people were trying to cleanse themselves from that hippie, Earth-loving 60s.I'm going to fast-forward a bit. A friend wanted me to see Omen III, or The Final Conflict, so I figured I'd revisit the series. I remember seeing the first and the 2006 remake years ago, but not parts II and III. But, I don't remember the content of either much, so this was like first-time viewings for me.I wanted more, I thought as I watched part 1 from 1976. I loved the story, sets and acting, plus the gruesome deaths from that timeframe. But, I still thought more could've been done to expand on the story.That all said, I now appreciate this film more thanks to the 2006 remake. That hollow, terrible retread really showed me how powerful and effective the original was.On its own, it's still a nice, slow-burn of an Antichrist story. Basically, spoiler?, Damien comes into the lives of a political couple and whenever anyone comes close to the truth, they mysteriously disappear. Will 5-year-old Damien survive all his assassination attempts? I dunno. Maybe look to see if there are any sequelsoh, I see.It's not perfect and it IS a slow-burn, but the score, acting, tension and absolute mood makes up for any shortcomings.***Final thoughts: After watching the original, and really only, trilogy, it's safe to say, just watch part one. None of the others are worth the trip. It's like one long 6-hour TV-miniseries with plenty of downtime throughout.",The Omen
50,sol1218,The Devil's Apprentice,9,8 June 2006,"(There are Spoilers) After the 1973 release of the devilishly inspired movie ""The Exorcist"" scores of films about the Devil were cranked out of the movie studios in Hollywood and overseas to take advantage, in their box office sales, of that ground-breaking horror classic. It wasn't until three later in 1976 that a movie came along that not only matched ""The Exorcist"" in sheer Satanic inspired terror but actually eclipsed it in it's storyline The movie has the Devil comes back on earth to usher in the End of Times that would effect the entire human race not just the little 12 year-old girl that the Devil possessed and took control of in that 1973 block-buster.Rushing to a Catholic Church run hospital in Rome where his wife Katie, Lee Remick, was about to give birth US diplomat Robert Thorn, Gregory Peck, is told by one of the men involved in Katie's hospitalization and delivery Father Spiletto, Martin Benson, that his and Katie's son was born dead. A shocked and heart-broken Robert is then told that his and Katie's dead son was replaced with a newborn baby boy who was born with his mother dying in childbirth. Robert knowing that Katie always wanted to have a child and that the news that her baby was delivered stillborn, and that she'll never be able to have children again, would kill her goes along with Father Spiletto and keeps the truth from Katie. The time of the Thorns adopted sons birth was recorded in the hospital at exactly 6:06AM Rome time the date was June the sixth or 6/06 and the Thorns named their son Damien, Harvey Stephens,With Robert later appointed to be the Ambassador to the Court of Saint James, Great Britain, things couldn't have been better for him and his wife and young son. Suddenly at Damien's fifth birthday party strange things began to happen that lead Robert to later believe, as the evidence piled up to the point where he could no longer ignore it, that whoever his sons real parents were they weren't human and even more shocking not of this earth!All this weirdness starts with Damien's nanny, Holly Palance, jumping to her death at his fifth birthday party, with a rope tied around her neck. Strange tings continue to happen with Damien exhibiting such subconscious terror that when taken to a local zoo with his mom the animals go completely berserk with fear at the very sight of the young boy. Robert is later contacted by a catholic priest Father Brenner, Patrick Thoughton, who claimed that he was at the hospital the night that Damien was born. Robert is told that Damien's birth mother was not a human being and his father was non-other then the Devil himself! In short Damien is the Beast predicted in the Bible to bring about the end of the world, and human race, in the climatic engagement between Good and Evil thats so frightfully described in the battle of Armageddon. What even more convinced Robert about Damien's dark background was when Father Brenner was killed, just after he got in contact with him about the truth of Damien's strange and demonic powers. Father Brenner's impending death was predicted by a number of photos of him taken by free-lance photographer Keith Jennings ,David Warner,that indicated,like they had with the deceased Damien's nanny, that he was somehow marked for death!Damien in the meantime was being protected from harm and exposer of his identity by his new nanny Mrs. Baylock, Billie Whitelaw, a fanatical crypto-Satanist and this vicious large and sentry-like Devil Dog that Robert, who was very intimidated by, seemed to have to way of keeping out of the house!Following up a number of clues to Damien's true identify both Robert and Jennings go to the cemetery where Damien's true mother is buried. The two are shocked to find, like what Father Brenner told Robert, that Damien's mother wasn't human! Just as Robert and Jennings are about to leave a number of wild Devil Dogs, much like the one protecting Damien, suddenly appear out of nowhere attacking and driving both of them out of the grave yard and surviving from being torn to pieces by climbing over the cemetery's iron fence.Robert and Jennins go to the Holy Land in Israel at an excavation site outside of Jerusalem's to see archaeologist Carl Bugenhagen, Leo McKern, about the true reason behind Damien's connection to the Thorns. Bugenhagen after confirming Roberts darkest fears gives him a number of knives that will put an end to Damien and the nightmare he's creating.Robert is again shocked down to his socks and soul when Jennings who tells him that he would eventually suffer an untimely and sudden death from a photo indicating it that he took of himself! Sure enough Jennings is later decapitated in a freak accident in the Holy City. Now almost a firm believer in that Damien is in fact the Antichrist of the book of Revelation Robert has one and only one doubt left to overcome and that's the Devil's mark, the number 666, that's to reveal Damien's true and horrifying identity. Coming home to the US Ambassadors residence outside of London Robert finds the ""mark"" secretly hidden under Damien's hair where he's suddenly and ferociously attacked from behind by Mrs. Baylock. The movie quickly moves to it's final and almost unwatchable and, in the case of whats expected of Robert Thorn to do, unbearable ending!Superior horror film that hasn't aged one bit since it's released thirty years ago with a really unique and unnerving soundtrack that's effectively used throughout the film, as well as in the opening and closing credits.

51,lost-in-limbo,He's evil. Pure evil!,8,24 March 2006,"Robert Thorn the American ambassador to Great Britain watches his wife's pregnancy when a priest tells him that his newborn has died, but he convinces him to substitute the baby (the wife not knowing) with another child that lost its mother in labour at the same time. Watching their young child growing up, he starts show unnerving signs, which the parents slowly start picking up on and also bizarre tragedies start occurring. This leads Robert on a whirlwind investigation that all points to his son being the Anti-Christ.Right off the heals of 'The Exorcist' successful stint with moviegoers comes another one of those endless 70s religious themed horror flicks involving Satanism. 'The Omen', I'd definitely say is one of the better horror films in the shadow of ""The Exorcist', but I'll even go to say its an vast improvement over it's influencer. That might be a surprise for some, but I found this film superior as it was more entertaining, fascinating and truly creepy in its context and shocks. Everything about it has a knack for falling into place. From the impending doom that's achieved by its coldly layered atmosphere to a premise that teases the viewer on how it's all going to play out. I won't deny that it seems silly enough when you pay close attention to it all, but with such conviction in the performances and that off confident direction, these factors makes sure that it doesn't slip overboard into cheesy daftness. Another stroke of brilliance would be Jerry Goldsmith's memorably, nerve-wrecking score with those explosive chants scattered throughout.On a grand scale the film was efficiently catered with well established cinematography and polished set-pieces that had penetrating might, which director Richard Donner handled with precise skill. Even when there wasn't much happening he knew how to keep things compellingly tight with good pacing and impressible imagery. Though, when it came to the essential thrills, he caps off some remotely tense (dogs' attack) and macabre moments (infamous decapitation) that display bite and flair. The climax is great and the ending is a fitting imprint too. The plot is filled with shocking revelations, interesting characters and it emits a glorious amount of excitement and dread from it mysterious outset.The performances are that of top quality by a stellar cast. Gregory Peck and Lee Remick are convincingly excellent as Mr and Mrs Thorn. David Warner turns in a marvellous performance as the photographer Keith Jennings. Then Billie Whitelaw is genuinely creepy as Damien's nanny Mrs. Baylock. Patrick Troughton is superb as the withering Father Brennan. But my applause goes to Harvey Stephens' who's the epitome of evil well; he definitely looked the part and had a memorizing awe as Damien. Although, Peck deserves more credit really, as he brought such devotion to his character that we honestly feel the pain and confusion that hits home.One of the true benchmarks of horror, along the same lines of 'The Exorcist', but for me it beats that film all ends up. Expect a devilishly good time!",The Omen
52,ElMaruecan82,Well I'll be Damned...,8,11 May 2018,"Weird, I was overly intellectual in my reviews of ""Rosemary's Baby"" and ""The Exorcist"", raving about the way these two horror milestones built up their premise around universal aspects of fear: loneliness in the midst of a conspiracy and fear of the unknown, mostly due to the fact that the 'villains' were invisible. About Polanski's masterpiece I concluded that its secret was to know how to keep a secret and that ""The Exorcist"" was so eerie it was scary even before the scare happened. Yet, given my adoration of New Hollywood, I never called a spade a spade and mentioned that these movies dealt with Satan, which was quite groundbreaking for its time. Religion has always prevailed in cinema's history as the Bible was a great provider of stories with as much thrills and hearts than any fictional best-seller or juicy screenplay... but religion has often served the epic genre and elevated glorious and uncorrupted figures without allowing Satan to rise above, with a few unlikely exceptions like Disney in ""Fantasia"". Maybe the devil is such a larger-than-life villain that the his existence is disturbing enough and there's no need to make a cinematic fuss about.Still, the New Hollywood period started with violence and sex ceasing to be taboos, so the days of religion were counted as well. ""Rosemary's Baby"" was the first to deal with it and had the nerve to feature such lines as ""Hail, Satan"". Some sneaky thinkers will add that the year after, Polanski's wife was savagely assassinated by Charles Manson's followers, cutting through Hollywood's state of grace with the realization that the world of sex, drugs and rock'n'roll had its evil counterpart, just like the Holy Trinity with the Anti-Christ. But the show went on and ""The Exorcist"" became one of the seminal blockbuster movies with the devil as the star, and once again, many strange events undermined the making of the picture, if not the crews' lives.It's just as if you couldn't make a movie about Satan without his eventual interference as if a giant had been awakened. But these movies barely showed the devil and were much about him as ""The Godfather"" was about Mafia, we saw, we understood, we perceived the malevolence but in an intimate way. Richard Donner's ""The Omen"" is intimate all right, as it's centered on a family: Mr. and Mrs. Thorn played by Gregory Peck and Lee Remick, but it also leaves no secret that we're dealing with the Anti-Christ. Writer David Seltzer knew the impact such a movie would have and decided to set the bar even higher than ""Rosemary's Baby"" yet with less supernatural extravaganza as the exorcist, and you've got it to hand it to the writing/directing, the dosage works. Indeed, this a solemn and serious horror drama, whose poignancy is enhanced by the behavior of the two parents, a rich and wealthy ambassador who learned his son's death and adopted a motherless newborn child the same night, both things unbeknownst to his wife. The story then is a stressful and disturbing escalation toward the necessary realization that something is wrong with the kid Damien, played Harvey Stephens, perhaps the most intimidating and frightening child from any film. He's as ominous as Danny in ""The Shining"" (some scenes even seem to foreshadow Kubrick's film) and unlike Regan in ""The Exorcist"", with his cherubim-like face, there's always a reasonable doubt over his vileness. Does the film work, now? Yes, and no... and then, yes. It works because all the signs leading to the final revelation are cleverly incorporated within the story, so that you have a fine alternation between shocks and interrogations, ""what just happened?"" and ""what the hell is happening?"". Many scenes became staples of horror movie and I must say some kept my eyes open wide and my mouth agape, it's one thing to wait for something bad to happen, and another to be shocked even after the anticipation... even that one we all know it was coming because of the premonition. So without spoiling any possible aspect, let's say that this is one hell of a hellish journey. Now, I'm not saying there are instances the film doesn't work, there's just a short sequence that slightly undermines the credibility of the story. When new nanny Mrs. Baylock (Billie Whitelaw) comes, you know there's something not very orthodox about her. Now I could accept trust at first sight, but her insistence not to take the child to church or to have a scary Rottweiler as a guard dog, should have alerted them. Or when the priest supposed to warn Peck starts quoting the Bible instead of just saying it played and straight. Many times, the film is in danger to fall in the 'idiot plot' trap but thankfully, it pulls itself together and get back on track when they finally become suspicious.But after all, these movies are all about signs, even more disturbing because they can be attributed to coincidences or accidents. Exactly like the curses we've mentioned, was ""Rosemary's Baby"" or ""The Exorcist"" or ""The Omen"" for that matter cursed (some coincidences are pretty creepy)? This is the stuff that can happen but we wish to ignore for our own peace of mind. Peck is the ultimate decent man, a rich, educated and good parent who can't believe in things that don't make sense, until it hits him in the face, sometimes painfully, sometimes with the help of people from a nosy photographer played by David Warner to an exorcist played by Leo McKern. The atmosphere is heavy loaded, the anticipations keep our hearts hooked, Jerry Goldsmith's Oscar winning score a haunting to the ears, the jump scares always effective... and there's that thorn you definitely wouldn't want in your side, that damned ""Damien!"", with his angelic face, would you believe that Gregory Peck would have the guts to do it? that question is disturbing enough to encourage you to watch this film.",The Omen

The success of the best pictures of this time was there understanding that the genre is fundamentally about fear and madness, not about monsters, although there must be something beneath the surface too, to put the audience on edge.  My own favourite is 'Don't Look Now', but 'The Omen' is genuinely chilling, with an excellent performance from Gregory Peck as the man who adopts the devil for a son.  Less pretentious, and overheated, than 'The Exorcist', the film's strength lies in its relative restraint.  The surprise ending is good, as well.",The Omen
54,MOscarbradley,Something of a cult classic even if it isn't all that good.,5,15 October 2018,"When you set it beside something like ""Rosemary's Baby"", ""The Omen"" isn't really much of a movie but it has attained a kind of cult status and is even seen as something of a classic in some quarters, spawning not one but 3 sequels and a remake. It also set a trend for movies about the Anti-Christ and benefitted from a better than average cast headed by Gregory Peck, Lee Remick and David Warner while Billie Whitelaw is suitably unbecoming as one of Satan's handmaidens and it actually managed to pick up an Oscar for Best Score.For anyone who still doesn't know the plot it's about Peck's American Ambassador discovering the child he has taken home from the hospital after his own baby dies is actually the Son of Satan! Unlike ""The Exorcist"" there are no swivelling heads and a distinct lack of green bile but there are a couple of spectacular deaths, including a terrific decapitation scene. The first sequel, ""Damien; Omen II"" is less po-faced and actually a lot more fun.",The Omen
55,gbill-74877,Fantastic,9,20 October 2021,"A truly creepy film, all the more sinister because it asks the viewer to believe the agents of diabolical evil include a small boy and some sweet looking doggos. The gradual realization an ambassador and his wife (Gregory Peck and Lee Remick) have that's something's amiss with their son plays out beautifully, with some brilliantly tense scenes involving the nannies, a troop of baboons, and a cemetery at night, all of which are given a dreamlike feel by director Richard Donner. The casting choices were great, especially Harvey Stephens (the boy) and Billie Whitelaw (nanny #2), and the soundtrack has to be among the all-time best in cinema.The film is obviously awash in Christian lore with the Antichrist and Book of Revelation references, and I like to think of it as being bookended by the original sin of the man not being honest and telling his wife the child wasn't theirs, and its excellent ending which channels Abraham being asked to sacrifice Isaac. And while we see evidence of the Devil in his minions and the macabre accidents that befall those trying to stop him (e.g. Impaling, beheading), there is less evidence of God, something I found wonderfully subversive and perhaps truer to the way of the world. Dark and chilling stuff, which still works 45 years later.",The Omen
56,lesleyharris30,"Great Performances make this Movie seem Scarier than it is,",5,30 August 2015,"The Omen is a decent movie with a reasonably well developed storyline and a great cast. The film is considered a classic and a landmark of the horror genre, to me the thing that makes this is the acting, the performances offer the most thrills, you can really see and feel the fear from the actors, particularly Gregory Peck, one of the most talented actors who ever lived, here he delivers some stellar acting as a concerned and frightened father, and he stays as that throughout. To be entirely honest, the film never really does it for me as a horror, it really dosen't try to be as consistently scary as many people may think, there are long periods of time where the characters are simply talking, and once we do get to some exciting moments I simply feel let down from all the build up. The movie is also very far fetched which is why I wasn't particularly frightened, the idea of Satan coming to Earth and taking over the body of a child is bizarre, and it never tries to make this story seem real, there is no indication of the filmmakers trying to make its audience think they're watching something that could happen, and because of that I simply didn't feel scared. I'm sure many people think differently, but I find the Omen to be a boring, overrated horror that's big on acting but small on thrills, and I wouldn't recommend it. The Devil returns to Earth in the form of Damien, the son of an American diplomat. Best Performance: Gregory Peck",The Omen
57,Irishchatter,A Devil Child!,8,21 January 2016,"I really enjoyed the movie regardless if it was gruesome, scary or full of deaths. It does make you feel like you are cursed in a way, it's not real but you do feel that someone is watching you lol. The Omen does remind you a lot of ""The Shining"" except the child was already the son of Lucifer. I would've loved to have seen the dark God in this actually! I never knew there was an actual novel of the movie, it probably did get it all but again, no film ever does. When you look at even a Harry Potter book, you would realise that there are important story points missing in the film series!I think if Damien was already killed off, then it wouldn't need to have sequels. It was really a bad idea as well to make ""The Omen"" a remake. I never would be a fan of remakes or sequels, Hollywood just ruins the title!

58,CuriosityKilledShawn,Absolutely horrible,1,23 September 2008,"The Omen does NOT deserve its classic status, not in my opinion. It's no different than any other 70s exploitation flicks. Whereas rubbish like Last House on the Left and others were considered trashy and confined to grindhouse cinemas, The Omen (a really crap title when you think about it) undeservedly got a higher status because of the cast and studio.LHOTL was honest about being nonsense, but The Omen, desperate to be the next Exorcist, manipulated and preyed upon the naive public's fears of THE DEVIL (dun, dun DUUUUUUUN) with a load of gobbledygook hocus-pocus and characters so stupid you wish they'd just die horribly and get it over and done with.Gregory Peck (a highly respected actor) seems so stiff and bored in his role that every scene with him is difficult to watch. The only actor worth watching in this gibberish is the underrated David Warner.It's just garbage. Cheap, nasty, exploitative garbage and a classic in no way whatsoever. The 2006 remake achieved the impossible and actually made it worse.Oh, and by the way, 'O Fortuna' by Carl Orff has nothing, NOTHING to do with The Omen.

59,vincentlynch-moonoi,"Simply brilliant, but brilliance did not beget brilliance",8,31 December 2014,"You pretty much are guaranteed a home run when Gregory Peck is first up to bat. Then add in the wonderful Lee Remick, the intriguing David Warner, and a dose of Leo McKern, and you've got a ball game! This first film is the Omen trilogy has it all. A superb cast, a good plot that restricts itself to a limited time period, top notch special effects (at least for the time; although the beheading scene is till terrific), and an age old prophecy turned into a modern-day story. My only complaint is that it's too bad there wasn't someone like Peter Jackson around to supervise the two sequels...because that's where this tale of 3 films falls apart...no uniform guiding hand to keep the sequels up to the level of the original.Of course I saw this film at the theater back in 1976, but I hadn't seen it since until 2014. I had forgotten just how good it was. Let me restate that. I had forgotten just how great it was.And I think here is the key that made ""chapter 1"" so good -- superb acting crafted by Gregory Peck and Lee Remick that made us want to like those lead characters. It was ever hard to resist resist Damien! Compare this to the first sequel where William Holden and Lee Grant seem cold and don't make us want to like them at all. I'd almost have to say that Peck is masterful here...although I wonder how much he liked tackling this kind of project.For those of us who enjoy ""quality"" horror films, this one fits the bill!

60,Bored_Dragon,"True masterpiece, within the genre and in general",10,27 April 2018,"Richard Donner's horror classic ""The Omen"" is not nearly the most terrifying, but it certainly is the best film of this genre I have ever watched. And I watched a lot. The creators adhered to the golden rule that there must be nothing in it that can not happen in reality, which, on the one hand, limits the possibilities of leaving the imagination at will and make the film visually shocking, but on the other hand, it makes it more realistic and believable, and therefore more essentially dreadful. If we ignore the basic premise that Damien is literally the son of the Devil, story development, characterization and the way in which gradually builds up the atmosphere, make this film more eerie drama than a real horror. On the technical side, there's hardly any flaws, and among the actors in particular stand out performances of five-year-old Harvey Stephens in the role of Antichrist and Billie Whitelaw as a hellish nanny. And as icing on the cake, the greatest asset of this film is original music by Jerry Goldsmith, for me one of the greatest masterpieces of film music, for which he deservedly won an Oscar.10/10The quantity of jinx that followed the film was too big to be just a coincidence, so many believe that the movie touched in things that are better be left alone and thus earned the ""curse of The Omen"". Star Gregory Peck and screenwriter David Seltzer took separate planes to the UK, yet both planes were struck by lightning, and in Rome, lightning just missed the producer Harvey Bernhard. The plane that Peck was supposed to fly to Israel, from which he gave up at the last minute, crashed and there were no survivors. Rottweilers hired for the film attacked their trainers. A hotel at which director Richard Donner was staying got bombed by the IRA and he was also struck by a car. Several other members of the crew survived a frontal collision on the first day of shooting, and during post-production, John Richardson, in charge of special effects, suffered an accident in which he was injured and his girlfriend was beheaded. It only remains for us to hope that the ""curse"" refers only to creators, not to the audience.",The Omen

The filmmakers take this nonsense much too seriously. It may have worked better as a black comedy. The script follows no logic. Donner goes for cheap thrills at every opportunity, but what are supposed to be the big scary moments are poorly executed and not the least bit scary. Peck manages to keep a straight face through all the silliness, but at age 60, was a bit long in the tooth to be believable as a first-time father.

62,jacobjohntaylor1,A very scary movie.,5,21 July 2016,This is one of the scariest movie made before 1981. It has great acting. It also has a great story line. It also has great special effects. It one of the scariest movies from the 70's. 7.6 is overrating it just a little. It is good but it is not that good. I have it 5 out of 10. Omen III The final conflict is better. This movie is a must see. It is a true of classic there is a lot of hype about this movie. Exorcist II is better. But still this a great movie. Scarier then Silence of the lambs could ever be.

63,Dr_Coulardeau,Far from what I expected,8,24 November 2008,"Creepy: ""When the Jews return to Zion / And a comet rips the sky / And the Holy Roman Empire rises, / Then You and I must die. / From the eternal sea he rises, / Creating armies on either shore, / Turning man against his brother / 'Till man exists no more."" Fake quotation from the Bible of some Yeats-like poem, hardly supported by the Book of Revelation. Apart from that bigot filiation to texts that are absolutely transcending in their inspiration and here reduced to some superstitious unfounded belief. We have to go over this vision and the unacceptable use of dogs to protect the son of Satan, the Antichrist, a direct allusion to the dogs of Allah, to the Moslem creed actually more rather than less hinted at with Jerusalem and the discovery of the roots of Christianity on a background voice-over of a Muezzin calling for prayer. Then the film is an archetypical matrix for so many films to come that will describe the coming of the Antichrist. Yet no film will ever be as short and as powerful as Yeats' ""The Second Coming"". The film is a masterpiece in cinematographic form, though it is rather easy and uses some techniques (hiatus and ellipse) that are so common that they need some renewing to be as effective as they could be. That is to say that this film has aged because it uses techniques of cinematographic story telling that have been so much improved and multiplied over the last three decades that they seem slightly weak in this film. In a way that's a shame because it remains a matrix of that type of horror stories but it has lost a lot of its bleakness and terrifying effect. I even find it weak in some sections, like the killing of the devilish son. Weak and tamed and softened and many other things. Thirty years ago killing a child of five could seem horrible. Today, I just wonder if it is not something we are born with. After all the genocides of the last twenty years and all the suicide bombers, even at times women with child, we have the right to wonder if that insanity is not in-grown in our memory from beyond birth and death, like some genetic inheritance, some genetic re-incarnation. I was expecting something a lot more powerful because I will definitely consider that the religious gibberish in the film is just what it is ""gibberish"".

64,johnnyboyz,"Teaming up to take on The Devil, no less; a more than competent thriller about the gradual uncovering of something estranged and unpleasant, which works well.",7,3 October 2011,"One of the more telling moments of Richard Donner's original The Omen unfolds nearer the end, much nearer the end, during which a composition of the lead character's face fills the screen as he lies down whilst on board an overnight flight to the territory of Palestine. The film changes its scenery, a much longer shot of the locale at which he was just travelling to and has now arrived at; but Donner cross-dissolves from our lead's face and into the establishing composition of an array of centuries old ruins lying there in the beating sun rather than merely cutting to it, a highlighting of how far along he's come in the Hellish quest of realisation that he's had to undertake and a reiterating of how everything, at least inside of his life or mind, has quite literally gone to near-wreckage. But that comes later on down the line; Donner's film about the impending doom of a situation should a more than apt-lead fail, and a somewhat exquisitely made piece which makes great use of its premise in order to unearth some genuinely exciting thrills, spills and shocks. It totals up into an exciting, what I like to refer to as a satanic thriller more-so a horror, which succeeds in involving us as much as we are when the above edit unfolds.Robert Thorn, played by Gregory Peck, is an American senator. The man is quite clearly in a state of distress when we first see him; his charging through the Italian streets of Rome, whilst sat in the back of a taxi, as a voice-over of what we perceive to be a recent telephone conversation telling us of how a baby has just died at birth, fills our ears and gets across an unnerving sense about proceedings from the off. Arriving at a nunnery-come-hospital, he sits outside in a waiting area – the man cutting a distraught figure as we appear to glance down at him from the first floor through some banister bollards somewhat eerily resembling a child's point of view as they glance down at the ground floor from up on high. It is Thorn's child and wife of whom the voice previously spoke, and his arriving at the building sees him get there in the nick of time to make a drastic decision over whether to adopt a previously born child whose mother eerily died in tandem with that of the Thorn's own. Known to Robert, but not to his wife Katherine (Remik), whose grief and natural reactions to such a tragedy are denied, he agrees and makes the switch with those running the monastery - the Thorn's leaving with a newborn after all.That child is Damien (Stephens), someone of whom grows up in affluent and loving family conditions until he becomes a young boy of about five years old when all manner of sordid activity begins to happen. But again, that comes later – much later. In the mean time, we get the sense that Robert is a guy with a fair old ability to get things done. His career within the field of politics sees him with a deal of charisma and carry a general sense of profundity; a man whom, by his wife's own admission, humorously or otherwise, could very well be one the ""future presidents"" of The United States. The Thorns move from Italy to England's capital city, London, upon Damien's ""birth""; their wealthiness and this general sense of the family being better off in life than most others is here put across via the fact they are chauffeur driven around a series of London streets rife with other vehicles looking less than glamorous, and probably housing people of a less wealthy disposition, in comparison.Then comes the grief and the strife; a series of episodes highlighting how seemingly disturbed the boy is coming along and then passing by, in the process piling it onto us that trouble is afoot but done so through means subtly conveyed rather than bombardment: when a trip to an open plan zoo goes awry, we question as to whether the animals might just have genuinely been more aggressive that day. When he gets distressed at going to church, maybe he's just nervous or mildly autistic enough not to like large crowds at this early stage in life; perhaps, when a maid commits suicide in the manner she does, she was just suffering internally herself and loved the boy too much to be dismissed from her duties. One of the perks for Harvey Stephens, Damien's actor, is that the more downplayed his performance, the more effective he is; that is to say, the less he reacts to all of this terrible, awful and quite disturbing content the better – the worse the actor, the more damn affecting the whole thing is.Thrown in for good measure is David Warner's photojournalist Keith Jennings, a man who, through the medium of photography (a relatively recent, in comparison, man-made invention which I'm sure Satan himself, whose existed from the dawn of time, didn't account on having his plans thwarted by) realises there are meanings behind certain blemishes in certain photographs he takes. There is method to these sequences; when one picture reveals Jennings to be as doomed as everyone that has preceded him, we sense the terror and the fear imbued within later scenes when Jennings puts himself on the front-line in the battle against evil which later makes itself known - such scenes build tension and draw on effect through the anticipation of the character's grizzly demise, a far cry from all the effect and all the 'substance' lumped onto that of what might pass as more recent horror fare when the mere presentation of the gory demises seemingly suffices. The film is a devilish mystery, a morbid detective thriller; a film able to etch out a general sense of unease just by having a photograph fill the frame – it is a worthy piece.",The Omen
65,filipemanuelneto,Better than many current horror films.,9,16 April 2020,"To give this film a chance, the ideal is to forget the logic a little, because the script and the plot don't have much logic and, if we start thinking about it, everything falls apart easily. I felt it after seeing the movie. And believe me, the film is tense and a little scary, and it will be worth giving it a try. It was for me.It all starts in a hospital in Rome, where the son of a senior American diplomat based there has just died at birth. Luckily, or just by chance, a young Italian mother also dies when she gives birth to a healthy baby boy. The diplomat then decides that he will be the father of that orphaned child and raise him as his own. It turns out that, over the years, the young boy seems to be accompanied by unusual characters and a scary dog, and dark things and deaths happen when he is around.Well, the film is not that good as the story is somewhat unrealistic and it all sounds quite exaggerated, but, placed in the context of horror films in general, there is no doubt that it scares more than many CGI loaded films and skips that are done now. Unlike the films of today, which are based on the amount of jumps they can cause, it is a film that feeds a lot on the environment and the permanent tension, slowly built up. That works for me a lot better than making me jump in the chair. The actors' work is also quite good. Gregory Peck was already a veteran and did an excellent job, he is quite credible in his role and his growing doubt about his son's nature seems truly real. Lee Remick is also a good actress. She gives good support to Peck and her work gets even more interesting as she demonstrates her character's growing depression and anguish. Billie Whitelaw is truly scary and an important addition to create suspense and intensify the film. David Warner was fine, but I found his character weak and not very credible even by the standards of this film. Patrick Troughton was quite credible in the role of a priest who lost his mind, but he also has a debatable character.Technically, the film is not a masterpiece but it met my expectations. Richard Donner was a good director and guaranteed good editing and post-production work, good footage and camera work. The film is a little dated: cinematography, a little faded, colorless and uninteresting to our eyes, was very common in the films of the Seventies, and the clothes, hairstyles and cars are from that decade too. But I handled it well, after all today's films will also look dated some fifty years from now. Of all the production values I would highlight especially the good filming locations and, above all, the extraordinary soundtrack by Jerry Goldsmith, winner of the Oscar for Best Soundtrack that year. It is rare, but sometimes it happens in horror films that we find a soundtrack that can, in fact, make the film even more frightening.I don't know if this film has already reached the status of classic or cult, but I think it deserves to be revisited today. It is not a pearl, it will not mark anyone's life, but it does what a horror movie should do: mess with our fears and make us feel uncomfortable to the point of make us feel nervous if we hear a noise in the room while we see it.",The Omen

72,FiendishDramaturgy,Preachy classic,5,9 September 2004,"This movie is a classic in the horror genre. But it is also a two hour sermon touting the mainstream bible and the dogma found therein.The catholic church has amended its interpretation of the biblical book of Revelations to say that it is no longer considered a prophecy but, like much of the bible, a parable. That declaration rendered this franchise rather moot, but if you are not watching this line for the ethical and biblical implications, it is still an entertaining two hours.It is rather dated and slightly contrived, but those contrivances are easily forgiven against a backdrop canvas of excellent camera work and a musical score that will really get your heart pumping. Also present are some great performances, particularly that of little Harvey Stephens, who really hasn't done much else in the way of acting since. Greggory Peck offers up his usual professionalism as the little bugger's father and Lee Remick delivers what is probably one of her best performances.Gather all that together and you've got one well done horror flick. Completely wrapped around the monotheistic mainstream religion, this is merely a movie for the sake of entertainment. There is nothing here which is thought-provoking or enlightening. I can't help but wonder what the populace of the rest of the world (which is NOT as wholly anti-open-mindedness as is the USA) thinks of American movie makers' obsession with the neochristian devil. America seems to think it is the sole owner of that religion.How ignorant.On a brighter note, this movie spawned a good line of self-serving horror.

But when we are talking about a movie like (The Omen - 1976), then it is not the same.Here we have great stars: (Gregory Peck) as the best star you can get for the role of (Robert Thorn), (Jerry Goldsmith) himself, and MR. Superman, Lethal Weapon, Maverick's (Richard Donner); he is one of my favorite directors.You will find too smooth but deep cinematography by (Gilbert Taylor), there are lots of good scenes like the cemetery scene as one example. I think it was the time that big producers in Hollywood wanted horror movies for families, without any sex, nudity, violence, or bad language. And that just suits me very much.I hated 2 things though: The 6 year old kid (Harvey Stephens) as the title character (Damien) didn't do any scary acting, or acting. Sure he was badly casted, or badly directed, or both. Add to that, the last scene in which the devil's son is standing between a man and a woman. I had a long time to understand that the man was the president of USA with the first lady. And for your information, I knew it from a book by the great English cinema critic (Peter Nicholls)!Finally, it is a movie where evil is the conqueror at the end. That is important, as well rare, for an American movie back then. And as for me, it is a very very rare to say: ""I love this"" about a horror movie!",The Omen
75,Bezenby,He's here! And he want rusks!,7,20 November 2012,"Gregory Peck looks suitably concerned as it turns out that the baby he hastily adopted on the night of his own baby's death may be the son of the devil. Turns out the book of revelations details the second coming of the Antichrist or something, so it's an all out adventure for Peck and sidekick David Warner as they try to get to the bottom of the conspiracy. Good old Christian doctrine comes into play here as we've got the doubting (at first) Peck, who writes off Damien's behaviour as that of a normal five-year-old. As the proud father of my own little Damien, I have spent many an hour checking my kid's scalp for three sixes, especially after he's tried to put our budgie in a blender or destroyed a piece of furniture, but at least I haven't had a priest turning up at my door pleading for me to kill my own child. Also, I'm sure that when our babysitter killed herself it was just due to the brimstone tinged contents of our kid's nappy, rather than being compelled to swing from a rope by a persuasive dog. The first Omen film is rather good. It's filled with dread and there's some pretty good set pieces in there, plus when you've got decent actors like Peck and Warner playing it pretty straight that helps things too. It's still worth a watch after all these years, but sad to say any of the sequels don't really stand up to the original.",The Omen
76,jamesrupert2014,Good entry in the 'creepy kid' genre,7,19 October 2018,"Evidence mounts that Gregory Peck is the foster father of the Antichrist, as does the body count. While including some imaginative death scenes, including the famous decapitation scene, the film is remarkably bloodless. Not a bad entry into the Satanic kid's club (but not in the same league as ""Rosemary's Baby"" (1968) or ""The Exorcist"" (1973)). The cast, including young Harvey Stephens as Damian, is quite good, as is the story and script (although current audiences, weaned on Buffy etc., may consider the constant explanations of '666' superfluous). The ending is a bit of a letdown and the film spawned a number of limp sequels, but otherwise, worth watching.",The Omen
77,generationofswine,An Honest Review,10,1 July 2017,"I just recently re-watched this and the remake...there's really no fair comparison.Gregory Peck wins over Liev Schreiber, but then Peck is the better actor.Lee Remick is far more believable than Julia Stiles who doesn't seem to convey the same earnest fear and suspicion.David Thewlis is a good actor, but in bit parts he always seems to phone it in and David Warner was just the more believable photographer.I mean, the 1976 The Omen is dated, but that's not a bad thing and in this case you get the sense that they were doing something fresh and really trying to frighten you...and they did.By comparison the remake is paint by numbers and offers nothing new.1976 is, hands down the more frightening, more dramatic, and more suspenseful film. Compared to 2006. 1976 is believable.",The Omen

It is also my birthday, in fact I was 6 when this was released, I've always found that pretty cool. Anyway, to the movie, 44 years on and I still think it to be not only one of the best horror movies from the 1970's (and there were some truly marvellous ones),but also one of the best films of Satanic cinema. Great cast, well filmed and comes with an effective musical score by Jerry Goldsmith.Most of the movie takes place in Britain and I love influence of British horror, there is also a cemetery scene in Italy which is pure Gothic. The Omen is well known for its imaginative, brutal deaths, in particular a young nanny hanging herself at a kids party, plus we also get one of the best decapitations ever filmed. Now I'm not religious, neither do I believe in the existence of the Devil, but immersed into the story it is both gripping and scary. A must see for horror fans.

Damian Thorn who is born from a Jackal was switched at birth with son of an ambassador. He's the anti-Christ, and has the mark of 666 on his head. The story unfolds as his father gradually finds out what his son really is.Not only was the theme sensational, so was the intricacies of the plot, and the story itself. Not to mention the very stylish and gory ways people gets killed. The only movie I can think of that comes close is ""Eyes Wide Shut"". First class acting by the stars also adds to the quality of the movie. One of the best horror movies to be made. This one is definitely worth the watch.",The Omen
80,ackstasis,"""Have no fear, little one... I am here to protect thee.""",8,1 July 2007,"The extraordinary success of William Friedkin's 'The Exorcist' in 1973 triggered a surge of (usually cheaply-made) horror films centering on Satanic possession or demonic children. Of these films, the best of the bunch is surely Richard Donner's 'The Omen,' which took a very simple horror concept and gave it an air of respectability through an experienced cast, excellent writing and a terrifyingly apocalyptic soundtrack from Jerry Goldsmith.When the only son of Richard and Katherine Thorn (acting veteran Gregory Peck and Lee Remick) dies within moments of his birth, Richard makes the difficult decision of secretly switching his child with that of a newly-arrived orphan. Young Damien (Harvey Stephens) grows into a quiet and adorable five-year-old, the only child in a powerful American political family. However, it is at this point that Richard notices some mystifying oddities about his young son. People around him begin to die in horrible ways: a young nanny hangs herself, a cautionary old priest is impaled by a long metal rod blown from the roof of a church. Richard Thorn, with the help of photographer Keith Jennings (David Warner), slowly begins to suspect the horrible truth  that his adopted son is the offspring of Satan, the literal Antichrist, destined to doom every last human being on the planet.Coming into this film, it seemed odd that an actor as famous and respected as Gregory Peck had chosen to star in what looked to be a pretty average horror fare. However, there is certainly more to 'The Omen' than initially meets the eye, and Peck's acting is integral to this. Perhaps because his performance as Atticus Finch in 'To Kill A Mockingbird' is so strongly ingrained in cinematic culture, Peck's character exudes such earnestness and integrity that we can only sympathise with his impossible plight, and are wholeheartedly convinced that the killing of a young child is the only way to reach a happy conclusion. After all, young Damien is not even human, is he? Young Harvey Stephens is excellent as the devilish youngster, switching effortlessly between his violent fits of satanic anger and the quiet, innocent pleading of a terrified child. Lee Remick, the delightfully-evil Billie Whitelaw, David Warner and Patrick Troughton also give very solid performances that help make the film as good as it is.Seventeen-time nominee Jerry Goldsmith won his only Oscar for 'The Omen,' a accolade that was certainly not undeserved. The intensity of the film's dramatic scenes is essentially doubled with the addition of Goldsmith's score, which features a strong choral segment, with a memorably foreboding Latin chant. The refrain of the chant goes as follows: ""Sanguis bibimus, corpus edimus, tolle corpus Satani {We drink the blood, we eat the flesh, raise the body of Satan},"" interspersed with cries of ""Ave Satani!"" and ""Ave versus Christus"" (Latin, ""Hail, Satan!"" and ""Hail, Antichrist!"").",The Omen

One of the results of this was the Omen Trilogy, of which this was the only good movie. An American Ambassador son dies on June 6, at 6 AM (6-6-6, get it?) and they give him a replacement baby. Later on, Doctor Who tells him that he needs to embrace Jesus! Then he gets impaled on a spike and doesn't regenerate. Meanwhile, the Ambassador teams up with David Warner where they discover the extent of the Satanist plot to put the Anti-Christ in a position to take over the world. It finishes with a confrontation at the end where the Anti-Christ lives to be in two more movies. On a related note, one of the major characters talks about having an abortion. Something a major character in a movie would never talk about today. the movie is quite good and atmospheric, with Jerry Goldsmith's score making things scary without a huge special effects budget.

In 1973, Satan himself took control of a teenage girl, scaring people witless for ages (The Exorcist). In 1976, his son came back, this time under the appearance of a five-year old boy...Thirty years on, The Omen remains one of the best horror films of all time. I saw it for the first time a few days ago, and I had trouble falling asleep the following night. Like in Halloween, there's almost no gore at all, but that doesn't weaken its ability to shock. If you want real horror but can't stand blood, The Omen is perfect.The movie begins in Rome, where American diplomat Robert Thorne (Gregory Peck) is told his son died just after birth. Since his wife (Lee Remick) doesn't know about it, he accepts father Spiletto's offer: to take care of an orphan and raise him as his own child. Five years pass, and Damien (Harvey Stephens) seems to have a great time living in London with the Thornes. If it weren't for that priest, Father Brennan (Patrick Troughton) who starts telling Robert the kid must die. And that inexplicable suicide at the birthday party. And that photographer, with whom Robert begins to realize the truth: what if sweet little Damien was actually the (literal) Antichrist?The Omen's power doesn't lie in the atrocious deaths or other ""typical"" shock factors. It's the subject itself that's unsettling. Consider the scene where Thorne (brilliantly played by Peck) starts having doubts about his son: should he kill him or not? That's a thought which is supposed never to even be joked about. It's the prospect of murdering a child that upsets the most, or at least that's what happened to me (I actually felt sorry for Damien, even though I knew I was making a mistake). And the whole thing is made more chilling by Jerry Goldsmith, whose score is arguably the best (read: scariest) horror soundtrack ever, bar John Carpenter's Halloween theme. Those tunes, alongside the last shot in the film (trust, you'll have a hard time forgetting that one) make The Omen unmissable for those who love the genre. Rosemary's Baby aside, it's the best film ever made about the Antichrist. That Harvey Stephens really scared me...",The Omen

The story is also a good one and builds very nicely - it's true there are times when perhaps it gets a bit slow, but it is always interesting and more often than not a segment of the story concludes with some poor sod meeting their maker.Director Richard Donner does a superb job here making good use of sound and incidental music to help send the chills down one's spine - if I was to be critical then I might say that the score was a tad over-used, but when it's as good as this one then this never really becomes a problem. Donner also gets good performances from pretty much all the main players; the best of the bunch are arguably Patrick Troughton, Billie Whitelaw & Harvey Stephens who all give very unnerving performances. Lee Remick and Gregory Peck are both good here, but they're not as memorable as some of the supporting players.As well as a decent story, a good score and a lot of good performances the film also boasts several memorable and nervy sequences; the graveyard scene, the scene with the first nanny and a couple of death scenes from key characters.

90,I_Ailurophile,"Timeless, chilling horror",10,13 April 2021,"Forty-five years after its release, the pall of doom exuded by 'The omen' has not waned: This is a thrilling, startling horror classic that stays with us well after we're done watching.With rare exception, the power of horror as a genre is in eliciting visceral reactions from the audience. This may be achieved with blood and gore, with ""jump scares"" to inspire acute fright, or with pervasive atmosphere to continuously feed the audience a sense of foreboding. It's the latter that I particularly favor in horror, and 'The omen' is full of it.'The omen' succeeds so greatly in ramping up tension, suspense, and atmosphere throughout its picture that it handily counters the possible flaw in its design. Horror films, even more than in any other genre, live or die on suspension of disbelief. If an audience can't press pause on their senses to indulge the ""What if..."" scenario a movie presents, it's going to fail. This is particularly challenging with pictures that in any way emphasize religious mythology, as someone who doesn't share the beliefs that a film centers is going to find themselves disengaging from the story. It's why tales involving exorcism mostly bore me.Yet even as 'The omen' goes all in on supposed prophecy and imagery in the Christian Bible (and champions the horror trope of creepy children), the threat represented in Damien exceeds the limits of religious iconography to become a generalized embodiment of ill tidings. Whether one is a believer devotedly clinging to every word in ""the gospel"" or a non-believer that finds religion at best passé, 'The omen' rises above the confines of its inspiration to become a chilling symbol of things going very, very wrong.One of the foremost keys to the movie's success is composer Jerry Goldsmith, whose original score not only complements but helps to wholly define the dark air about the feature. Haunting, unforgettable choral selections pair with low, ominous horns and otherwise tones to foster the sense that something very old, very ritualistic, and beyond easy comprehension is on the march. One can go years between viewings of 'The omen' and Goldsmith's music will reverberate in our minds all the while. There's no questioning that any composer who wins awards for their work has deserved it, but Goldsmith's Academy Award for 'The omen' strikes me as an exemplar of an artist being properly rewarded. Bravo!Lee Remick is great in her supporting role as the increasingly rattled Katherine Thorn, and it's always a pleasure to see David Warner - here portraying the well-learned photographer and investigator Keith Jennings. One must also give a nod to Harvey Spencer Stephens - only 6 years old at the time of the film's release, Stephens' range may have been limited by his age, but he perfectly portrays every cold stare and disquieting smile of Damien. Above all, Gregory Peck's starring role as Ambassador Robert Thorn is masterful, befitting a performer of his caliber. Thorn's gradual unraveling from distressed, to alarmed, to desperate is a fascinating journey in and of itself. Peck's stern gaze and unmistakable voice give Thorn a definite air of authority, making his character arc here all the more unsettling for the viewer - not unlike a child who sees their parent express fear.One can read apocalyptic verses from a religious tome all day and they'll make no impression, especially when they're couched in language and imagery that the most extravagant high fantasy can't be bothered with. In the capable hands of writer David Seltzer and director Richard Donner, to say nothing of other crew in the production, 'The omen' distills the fanciful notions of another age and gives them a relatable human presentation. There are plenty of scenes here to maintain unsettling atmosphere throughout the picture, and some acutely startling moments, too. From the details of Damien becoming part of the Thorn family to the thrilling conclusion after the ambassador has discovered the truth, 'The omen' never lets up enough for viewers to take it easy, with all points in between filled with creepy, troubling, and escalating events.Even still, part of the success of 'The omen' is in declining to fully show us its hand. The perfect 1976 ending brings the film to a chilling conclusion with an ominous portent of more terrible things to come. Unfortunately, that capstone was subsequently spoilt - like so many other features, this film's box office returns inspired a succession of sequels that were barely a blip on the cinematic radar by comparison. Ultimately those other films feel simply unnecessary, and dull the impact of the ending we get here. Like other lackluster sequels across many genres, perhaps we're best off just forgetting about them.Production standards have only improved in the past 40 years, as have special effects, and many horror films take advantage of these benefits to throw heaps of gore at the audience. But for whatever blood there may be here, or acute scares, it's generally deemphasized - and 'The omen' still handily bests many releases of the past several decades in doling out chills and thrills. It doesn't even need to rely on the religious connotations of its narrative to keep us at the edge of our seats.By the strength of its story alone, and the atmosphere and tension it builds, 'The omen' became an instant horror classic, and it holds up fantastically well even now. Flashier titles come and go, but this has a staying power that can't be denied, and shouldn't be passed up by anyone with a love of horror genre, or cinema as a whole.",The Omen
91,dworldeater,Untouchable classic,10,24 January 2020,"The genesis of The Omen was film producers looking to make something to ride the box office success of The Exorcist and to make something similar. However unlike most pale imitators The Omen, in my opinion is a lot better and one of the most well made horror movies ever. This put director Richard Donner on the map(, who was best known for television at this time) totally knocks this out of the park and became one of the most solid and versatile A list Hollywood directors of his time, with a large body of work in all kinds of genres. This is by far his best work and along with the cast and crew The Omen is flawless and the perfect horror movie. Absolutely terrifying with an equally engrossing story with an outstanding cast led by Gregory Peck with Lee Remick as his gorgeous wife with a just as remarkable supporting cast with unforgettable performances from British character actors David Warner, Billie Whitelaw, and Patrick Troughton. The film still looks real sharp with great cinamatography and has a eerie, hypnotic Oscar winning score by Jerry Goldsmith that helps evoke a foreboding and evil atmosphere that adds to the tension and terror of the film. Also, the devil is in the details with great locations, sets and props. Plus tight editing that amplifies the suspense in the right parts. Even though this is a story of a child that is the antichrist destined to rise from the world of politics to bring the apocalpse, their is nothing exploitive about it and is a first rate classy production. Another brilliant choice by Richard Donner is that the film allows the viewer to interpret it in two different ways. One could interpret this as a series of strange circumstances that lead to Robert Thorn's downward spiral into insanity and psychosis or if his adopted son Damien is actually the son of Satan. The Omen made lots of money at the box office and saved Fox studios from going bankrupt and in doing so the profits from this helped fund another upcoming blockbuster Star Wars. This is the 1st and best of 3 films, the other 2 films in the trilogy are excellent, but this film is really special, unique and superbly crafted and powerful , that The Omen is in a class of its own and is A+ film making.",The Omen
92,Witchfinder-General-666,Sublime Occult Horror,9,12 November 2009,"""The Omen"" of 1976 is a true classic of occult Horror that is capable of mesmerizing and giving the viewer the creeps even after repeated viewings. Richard Donner's film was doubtlessly inspired by William Friedkin's earlier classic ""The Exorcist"", and, along with Friedkin's film, one of the absolute must-sees involving satanic kids. This simply is a film that works perfectly on all levels: The most intriguing Horror topic is illustrated with a spine-chilling and fascinating premise, and executed brilliantly on all levels. The film is an incredibly atmospheric, persistently suspenseful and genuinely creepy Horror Thriller and an intelligent Drama at the same time. The fascinating story is brought to screen with greatness in all aspects, be it the ingenious settings and cinematography, the constantly high suspense-level, the great acting or the tense atmosphere which is underlined by a simply unforgettable score.Robert Thorn (Gregory Peck) is the American Ambassador in Rome. When his unconscious wife Catherine (Lee Remick) gives birth to a stillborn baby boy, Thorn can't bring himself to tell her. At the suggestion of a priest, he exchanges his dead son with another newborn boy, whose mother has died in childbirth, making his wife believe the healthy boy is hers. Both his real son, who died, and the the other boy whom he accepts as his son were born under a bad Omen: it is the sixth hour of the sixth day of the sixth month; the year is 1966. The couple name the boy Damien... Five years later, the Thorns have moved to London, where Robert has become the U.S. Ambassador to England. With Damien's fifth birthday party, mysterious things begin to happen around the boy...""The Omen"" is one of several 'demonic child' films from the 70s, but, in my humble opinion it is definitely one of the best ones. Personally, I would even say it surpasses both previous films that it is most often compared to: Roman Polanski's ""Rosemary's Baby"" (1968) and Willaim Friedkin's ""The Exorcist"" (1973). These two films are both classics, no doubt, but while ""Rosemary's Baby"" has dated a bit, and also has its lengths, and the ""Exorcist"" has many unforgettably creepy moments but sometimes lacks cohesion, ""The Omen"" is incredibly suspenseful from the beginning to the end, and its coherent and extremely creepy script is brought to screen in a brilliant manner in all parts of the film, forming a stunningly uncanny and tense wholesome. The film has an intensely creepy atmosphere and a constantly gloomy feeling of doom from the beginning. The story simply is very creepy as such, and director Donner brings it to screen in a manner that is truly magnificent. The photography, choreography and settings, and, maybe most memorably, the brilliant, spine-chilling score - this film's atmosphere is rich in all aspects. At the same time, ""The Omen"" is also a compelling and highly intelligent film with complex characters. The acting is superb. Gregory Peck's reputation as one of the greatest actors ever in cinema is no coincidence, and he is once again brilliant here. Great performances also come from the other cast members, such as Lee Remick who plays the wife, David Warner, or Patrick Troughton, who plays a great little role and whom fellow Horror fans will also know for his roles in Hammer's films such as ""Scars of Dracula"". Utmost praise has to be given to then-six-year-old Harvey Stephens, who once again proves that children can be the creepiest of all Horror creatures. His performance is scary and very powerful, one of the truly memorable child-performances in Horror cinema. The film mainly builds up suspense through plot and atmosphere and isn't very action-packed. Yet it includes several highly memorable disturbing and gory moments. The ingenious decapitation sequence is only one of them. ""The Omen"" is an absolute must-see for all Horror-fans and film- lovers in general. A remake was done in 2006, but I will probably never watch it (recent Horror remakes tend to make me angry). This original is a spine-chilling occult masterpiece that must not be missed... by anyone!",The Omen
93,ferbs54,Preaching To The Choir,8,13 December 2007,"At this point I feel that I might be the only person in North America who had not seen ""The Omen""...until last night, that is. (Well, OK, maybe my Aunt Frici in the nursing home hasn't seen it yet either.) So permit me a moment or two while I ""preach to the choir."" Far from being just another ""Exorcist"" rip-off, ""The Omen"" is a literate, handsomely mounted horror picture that shows us what happens when American ambassador Gregory Peck discovers that his cute little boy is no less a personage than the Antichrist. (And you thought you had problems with YOUR 5-year-old!) Peck's presence, as well as Lee Remick's, add immeasurable class and dignity to the proceedings. The picture would have been far less an achievement without their presences, but Richard Donner's imaginative direction and Jerry Goldsmith's creepy score (incorporating what sounds like Gregorian chants) help put it over the top. Billie Whitelaw should be singled out as well, for her turn as the (literal) nanny from hell. Leo McKern, strangely uncredited, is also fine in his small but crucial role. The film contains at least half a dozen classic and violent set pieces, culminating with what might be the most suspenseful haircut in film history. But then again, the entire film is extremely suspenseful and believable, and not a little scary. My stomach was in knots by the final credits, but I'm so glad that I FINALLY got to see this modern-era horror classic. Oh, by the way, the extensive extras on this commemorative DVD are fascinating to watch, as well.",The Omen
94,aidanratesmovies,"Interesting, but often slow. Gregory Peck shines",5,7 August 2020,"Slow paced and slow natured, but timely and well acted, The Omen may not be the strongest horror film of the 70's but it is certainly worth a watch. The film can be at times quite a bit formulaic, with its plot often going in circles as cliches are circled throughout themselves. However, Donner makes this work in a decent enough way with his impressive direction skills, as well as Gregory Peck in the lead role, with his excellent performance. The film does have a nice haunting score which can prove to be quite good at times, and certainly worthy of its Oscar win. The acting, aside from Gregory Peck, is still rather decent. No one shines as great as Peck, but Billie Whitelaw does provide an impressive performance as Mrs. Baylock, and truly brings a admirably originality to the role. In the end, The Omen had me a bit bored at times, and it could be a bit predictable. But more often than not, the talent both behind and in front of the camera is the reason why such a simple story succeeded in the end, and I am glad that it did so.
My Rating: 7.25/10",The Omen
95,Boyo-2,It was better when I was sixteen,7,5 September 2000,"Coming on the heels of ""The Exorcist"" probably helped this movie get made. It made piles of money and spawned several unnecessary sequels. It was a classy production with reputable stars (Gregory Peck and Lee Remick), and dependable co-stars are a sinister Nanny (Billie Whitelaw), and the venerable David Warner.  The movie is satisfyingly evil and scary but several scenes fall flat - Peck and Whitelaw's knockdown fight, in particular, should have been much better staged.  The whole thing is wrapped in a loud but effective Oscar-winning score by Jerry Goldsmith, which is perhaps the most memorable thing here.",The Omen
96,truemythmedia,"Fun, Schlocky, and Still Spooky",8,30 October 2019,"In my opinion, ""The Omen"" is just one step below horror greats like ""The Exorcist"" and ""Rosemary's Baby"". ""The Omen"" is a good movie- at times it's even very good- but there are also quite a few scenes where the film doesn't quite know what it wants to be; does it want to be a psychological thriller with subtle scares and revelations in the final scenes that really drive home the horror to linger in the viewer's mind long after the credits roll (like ""Rosemary's Baby""), or does it want to be a popcorn horror flick that enjoys making the viewer jump here and there while watching the film, but shortly after viewing it, the unsettled feeling one experiences quickly flees the body (like ""The Conjuring"")? I don't think the screenwriter, David Seltzer, knew, and I don't think the director, Richard Donner, knew either. This movie tries to be both an intense psychological horror movie and a film filled with schmaltzy, over-the-top kills and, surprisingly, it mostly works; mostly, but not entirely.",The Omen
97,Reviews_of_the_Dead,A Legit Horror Classic,10,11 March 2020,"This was a film that I'm pretty sure I saw after the remake. For whatever reason though, it just eluded me until college when I started to seek out more of the classics that all horror fans should probably have seen. I think this is only the second time that I've seen this one as well. The synopsis is mysterious deaths surround an American ambassador. Could the child that he's raising actually be the Antichrist, the Devil's own son?We start this movie on June 6th, at 6:00 am in the morning. Robert Thorn (Gregory Peck) is an ambassador for the United States living in Rome at the time. His wife is having their baby and he arrives at the hospital. He's told by a priest there that this son didn't make it. An alternative is given that a mother passed away during childbirth and that she had a son. It is kind of shady, but it is decided that Robert will present his wife Katherine (Lee Remick) with that baby as their own.It then gives us glimpses of the happy family until Robert is given the news that they're moving to London as he's been reassigned. His college roommate is now president and there are aspirations that Robert will be president one day as well.The first of the odd things happen at a birthday party for their son Damien (Harvey Stephens). Also at this party is a reporter of Keith Jennings (David Warner). Things take a turn though when the nanny hangs herself, stating that it is all for Damien.Another nanny shows up, Mrs. Baylock (Billie Whitelaw), but the family is confused as they didn't reach out to the service to replace the position. Things get even weirder when a Father Brennan (Patrick Troughton) arrives at Robert's office and locks them in, telling Robert that he must destroy his son before it is too late. At first, Robert doesn't believe him, but when things happen that correlate back to what he's been told, he starts to fear for the worst. Keith notices some odd things about some of the pictures that he's taking as well. Is Damien the Antichrist? Or is the stress of life getting to be too much for Robert, Katherine and Keith?Now if you read other reviews from me, you know that I really do love when religion is played with in horror and we get the perverting of that toward the side of evil. We really do get that here with this coming out in 1976 and the height of the 'Satanic Panic' era as well.This film doesn't play its hand too early though. We get the set up of Robert arriving at the hospital to learn that his son was a stillborn, but there's a baby without a parent born at the same time. Nothing really goes wrong until the nanny kills herself at the party. This could be chalked up to her being crazy and nothing more. It is really a slow build though to be honest. Katherine notices it first with animals being spooked when it is just her and Damien. She just feels there's something off about it. There's a blow up when they're going to a wedding in a church. It just presented in a way where there are rational explanations for things, but looking at them as a whole is where you start to think something else is up. To go even farther though, Robert debates what to do until the end and I love that. He's seen evidence, but what he has to do is pretty horrific and he questions it.If there's a subplot that I'm not in love with, it is with Keith. I don't necessarily know if I like the pictures showing things. It just feels a bit forced to have Keith become a major player later, but I do like what they do with this subplot in the end. I take this more as they wanted Robert to have someone do more investigation with and who better than having a photographer, as he knows how to investigate and has an eye for detail. In general really it feels like they needed something, so I won't say it ruins anything.This movie is really paced in a way where it never gets boring. I like that it slowly builds to the point where as a viewer, we know what is happening. The characters are putting things together so that helps us as well. Being the runtime is 111 minutes, it doesn't feel like it and I think it really isn't wasted either. Nothing feels forced, rushed or it doesn't really drag either. There also seems to be a few different self-fulfilling prophecies, which is a troupe I think is great. Do we definitely know at the end whether Damien is the Antichrist? Not necessarily, but the evidence is there and how it ends is great.That will take me to the acting, which is looking at the cast I'm surprised with how strong it is. Peck is a legendary actor from the past and I love that he took on this role. He's great as this politician which adds a layer to this story. He's in the limelight because of it, so he just can't do things as it would be a scandal. Remick is really good in descending into madness. I love that it plays with the mother intuition here. She doesn't know things, but she feels them and I like that aspect. Warner is someone that I knew growing up for more kid friendly movies, so I love seeing him in things like this. He's great in this secondary role he plays to drive the story. I like Whitelaw as this nanny that we don't feel good about, but the parents don't have a reason to distrust. There's just the feeling. I also think that Stephens does well in his limited role. He just has a creepy look for Damien, but still seems normal as well. The rest of the cast rounded this out for what was needed.The effects are really subtle actually and I think that really helps with the atmosphere. As I've said, things are played downplaye so we don't know if their fears are founded. We get to see what happens with Father Brennan, but no one else does. It looks real and I love this is done practically. I do have an issue with a death later that we can see was done with props, but it still has a bit of charm there. I think overall the effects were well done and the cinematography as well.The last thing to cover would be the soundtrack. It is mostly chorus style music that is done in Latin. I think this adds both the ambiance of religion, but also gives it a spooky feel that works with what the movie is going for. I'm not going to lie, I kind of what to seek it out for mood music while writing.Now with that said, this movie is really a classic. I love just how we're playing on the parent's feel that their child could be evil. They don't want to believe it and things are built on secrets. I'm not a religious person so seeing this family that really isn't either come to terms with the facts they're presented with is great. I think the acting really helps to bring this to life. The movie is slow in its build, but in a way where things are presented to drive the story. The effects are solid along with the cinematography and I really like the soundtrack that is coupled with everything. If there's any gripe would be the subplot with Keith does feel a bit forced, but I understand why it is there. This is a great movie, one of the best in the subgenre for sure. I would highly recommend seeing this film for horror and non-horror fans alike as is still works even almost 45 years later.9.5/10",The Omen

However-I can't say that I like this movie very much. I am a big fan of pschological thrillers-this was a combo of that and a classic horror but as much as it scared the heck out of me it didn't do much else-Many of the scarier movies from that time period wove more then just a scary spell-they made me appreciate the great story telling and I developed a real fondness for the movies over the years.(Jaws, The exorcist for example.) Not so-The Omen. It was just fear for fear's sake-to much tension but no fascination with the overall storyline.

'The Omen' boasted an impressive cast, a hugely inventive story (concerning the birth of the Anti Christ) and a really exciting series of death scenes. Actually what makes this film work so well is the seriousness of the main character, played by Gregory Peck. This coupled with an atmospheric musical score, by Jerry Goldsmith, ensures this would be a horror movie of both quality and distinction. A sure must see, for any true fans of the Horror genre.",The Omen
101,nycritic,That Weird Little Boy,5,20 December 2005,"Horror took an extreme left turn after ROSEMARY'S BABY. Where in that film, the 'horror' in itself was never seen except through dreamy suggestions, another film came and took center stage to claim its own niche in the list of ""scariest movies of all time."" THE EXORCIST was at its core a battle between good and evil to ensure the innocence of a little girl possessed by the insane spirit of a demon.That film broke all the barriers as to how horror could be filmed, what could be seen and what envelopes could be pushed. With groundbreaking use of music, sound effects, subliminal images and a genuine sense of extreme dread, director William Friedkin created a powerful, unforgettable film that until this day sends chills down anyone's spine.So it was natural with the advent of THE EXORCIST that films would capitalize on its success and horror would be expressed in even more graphic ways. Since it dealt with the conflict of Good vs. Evil at a religious level, why not bring that into the cryptic End of Days theme where Evil as an Entity would rise one last time and defy the Lord? Brilliant idea.Hence the plot of THE OMEN, which combined elements from these previous two films in the form of a conspiracy, not of Satanists but of evil priests longing to bring forth their own Antichrist, and what a better way than to give him a privileged birth where he could rise against mankind himself? This little boy would carry the symbolic name Damien -- daemon, demon -- and would wreck havoc against those perceived as threats.So into the Thorn household Damien comes and immediately, gruesome incidents begin happening. Not surprisingly, no one catches on until it is too late and the damage has been done -- a ploy made to ensure sequels, more than likely. How evil can be so powerful is beyond me, but apparently, it does know no boundaries. At least it showcases a slew of spectacular deaths, and poor Lee Remick has the unfortunate position of falling not once, but twice. (I think three would have been excessive.) This is the sort of film that is made for one purpose only: money. Laughable dialogue, moments that instead of scaring are irritating or plain flat, a conclusion anyone can see miles away, THE OMEN would indeed spawn two sequels and a made for TV movie, each worse than the previous. Sad to see actors the stature of Gregory Peck and Billie Whitelaw wasted in roles that are meaningless.",The Omen

I remember back when I was in my 12, I watched this with a friend in a Sunday morning. I remember how scared we were and how this film frightened us. I thought that seeing this now, after seeing lots of suspense films I would find this weak, but I still find it a little creepy. The scene that the dad was in Damien's room and began shaving his head has got to be one of the most suspenseful scenes in movies. The director dropped the background sound and we had no idea of what evil could happen.. Fortunately, nothing much really happened and we breath again only when the scene is over.The fact that it's a religious film makes me be less scared, since I'm an atheist and don't believe in these things. Still, the film is creepy enough to tense and entertain the spectator. An indeed classic!",The Omen

104,PredragReviews,Classic in Gothic Horror Genre,9,4 May 2016,"This 1976 horror film scored a hit with both critics and cinema-goers alike who had embraced a deep interest in Gothic horror and its history. It has a first-rate cast, superb acting, brilliant shock tactics and a soundtrack to send shivers down your spine whatever your state of mind! The cast is great, especially Gregory Peck, who is just a brilliant actor, and also Patrick Troughton (Klove from Scars Of Dracula) who brilliantly plays Father Brennan or the especially creepy nanny Mrs. Baylock (played by Billie Whitelaw). We also get to see a young David Warner and Lee Remick. Also remarkable: Harvey Stephens who plays Damien. Charlton Heston, Roy Scheider, Dick Van Dyke and William Holden were considered for the lead role of American ambassador Robert Thorn, but turned down the role. Also, Jerry Goldsmith won an Oscar for best original score and the demonic singing adds a lot of atmosphere to the story. It sounds impressive on the DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 track, as do some of the more subtle sounds such as gravel crunching underfoot. The track is front-heavy and a little quiet, but it does the job.The original part of the trilogy remains one of the best horror movies ever made, but it won't appeal to everyone. The pacing will seem slow by today's standards and the story relies on suspense, characterization and acting ability, rather than gore and special effects. Well worth seeing if you want to see how the genre has developed over the past four decades.Overall rating: 9 out of 10.",The Omen
105,philip_vanderveken,"For all the fans of suspenseful, but not gory horror movies",8,6 April 2005,"The problem with horror movies is that there are always two camps of fans. Those who prefer movies full of gore, zombies,... (for instance ""The Evil Dead) and those who like horror movies full of suspense like for instance ""The Others"" and this one. Personally I'm not a fan of gore, but I certainly can appreciate this kind of horror movies.Robert Thorn (Gregory Peck) is the American ambassador in Rome who's wife has a stillborn child. Because he can't tell her the awful news, he decides to adopt another child, whose mother died shortly after giving birth, and not to tell her the truth about her own son. The child who he adopts on recommendation of a priest, was born on the 6th of June at 6 o'clock in the morning (so at 6 on 6/6). Five years later the Thorns have moved to London, where they live as a happy family. Because of Damien's fifth birthday, they have organized a big reception and everything goes smoothly until his nanny throws herself of the roof with a rope around her neck. She's killed instantly in front of the eyes of the guests. But this isn't just a coincidence, many more people will follow her in death and all have something to do with Damien in one way or another. The child appears to be the son of Satan...As I already said, I'm a fan of horror movies that are full of suspense and this movie has plenty of it to offer. This entire movie is full of tension and thrills and offers exactly what I hoped for. And even though this movie is already about 30 years old, it still hasn't lost any of its power. Perhaps the main reason why this is, is because of the actor's performances. They all did a good job, but it is the little Harvey Stephens as Damien who steals the show. That little boy was just incredible. I really loved him in his role of Damien, the son of Satan. If you are a fan of horror movies that aren't full of gore, than I suggest you give this one a try. Don't mind about its age, it's a good movie and I reward it with at least a 7.5/10.",The Omen
106,Chase_Witherspoon,The devil went down to London,10,27 December 2012,"A film that polarises opinion irrespective of its religious incantations, some unimpressed by its comic-book style hokum, others like myself willing to be immersed in the tale of the anti-Christ (Stephens) born into a wealthy American family living abroad, setting a course for Satan's second coming. Peck, playing American Ambassador to the UK and his wife Lee Remick lose their child during birth, but with the assistance of corrupt clergyman Martin Benson, Peck manages to procure a replacement child of shady origins. In the history of bad decisions, this is right up there with the most catastrophic, as the baby Damien wields his unassuming temperament against those conspiring to subdue the rise of the devil on earth.David Warner co-stars as the intrepid photo journalist who's bitten off more than he can chew investigating a series of strange events surrounding the family, former ""Doctor Who"" incarnation Patrick Troughton has a memorable supporting role as a doom-saying priest, and other notable roles are played with aplomb by Martin Benson, Leo McKern, Bruce Boa, John Stride and Anthony Nicholls to name a few. Jack's daughter, Holly Palance has a great cameo in one of the film's many penultimate moments, early on at the birthday party.Billie Whitelaw's inspired performance as the sinister house-keeper is perhaps the template that would be emulated many times over (e.g. Dimitra Arliss in ""Bless the Child"" for example), and in my opinion, the real sleeper in this film. Her measured performance is one of the key aspects that elevates this tale beyond the comic-book hokum for which some reviewers hold contempt, notwithstanding the fuzzy logic on the religious overtures, which to be honest, who really cares. It's only a movie, and a chilling one at that, director Richard Donner immortalising himself with this effort, which in my opinion is easily in the top ten horror films ever made for its imagery, atmosphere, visual effects and of course, ""Ave Satani"" soundtrack.",The Omen
107,Gislef,Spoiler: The Devil Wins,7,25 November 2020,"I said it about the 2006 remake, and it applies to the original as well. 'The Omen' is typical of the 60s-70s trend of horror movies where evil wins. It started with 'Rosemary's Baby' in 1968, probably. And it continues on for various other movies, like 'The Awakening' that tried to cash in on the success of 'The Omen'.There's a certain fascination in the inevitability of watching Satan carry out his plan. But it's also kind of boring. Satan doesn't lose. Satan can't lose, given everything that's shown here. If Satan wants to replace a nanny with one of his own, then he's going to send a Rottweiler and it's going to make the first nanny kill herself. Not a thing anyone can do about it. Ditto for Father Brennan getting killed. He can run, but he can't hide.The horrific inevitability works better in the original as it does here,, both because it was relatively new at the time. And because it's not a remake. The one thing about the inevitability of the 2006 version is that it doesn't do anything different from this version. We know how the '76 version works, and the '06 version just did the same thing.It's also interesting to see the star power associated with the '76 version. You've got Gregory Peck rather than Live Schriever, and that's a step up right there. Lee Remick is more impressive as the mother than Julia Stiles. Harvey Stephens is better than Seamus Davy-Fitzpatrick. And you have great performer like Patrick Troughton, Leo McKern, Billie Whitelaw, and David Warner. Even if Warner's character Jennings is rocking the 70s leisure suit and hairstyle a bit too much. Ah, the 70s.So the '76 version works because of better performances and the fact that it's ""new"". Or at least it was at the time. These days it seems a bit more aged, but it's still a good high-budget horror movie for when it was made. Some of the material that has become tropish (like the Satanic chanting) which is tiresome now, was fresh in '76.But that's just my opinion, I could be wrong. What do you think?",The Omen
108,rivertam26,A great film that holds up,9,8 April 2020,"This film is so schlocky I love it. Its definitely a classic. Obviously you know it's about the devil's son and his younger years. Directed by Richard Donner of the Lethal Weapon movies the film pulls bo punches with its wild death set pieces. From a babysitter who hangs herself and crashes through a window to one hell of a decapitation by glass and even more. But what makes the film so effective besides the fine performances all around is the way in which the material was approached. In the beginning it's very much like a family drama and when it does become more it never tries to be scary it instead develops in truly shocking and freakish ways. The movie holds up and it's easy to see why it was a hit and spawned at least two good successful films.Budget: $3m

109,oneguyrambling,Some kids aren't that cute...,7,30 October 2010,"When a Mummy and a Daddy love each other very much, and they unfortunately have a baby who does not survive the birth, the Daddy shouldn't agree to take a newly orphaned baby without telling Mummy first.That's the first few minutes of The Omen, it opens in Rome and pretty much runs as described above. The father is Gregory Peck as Robert, a prominent politician (who has a great ""I AM ACTING!"" voice), and the mother is Lee Remick as Kathy. Faced with the choice of telling Kathy that the baby did not survive, or taking the opportunity handed when another mother dies during her own son's birth, Robert takes the latter way out.At the time the local priest says ""God has given you a son."" yeah, right. Let me know how that works out for ya.Cut to about 3 years later, Robert is promoted to be the US ambassador to the United Kingdom, resulting in an immediate move for the family and the young Damien.When Damien turns 5 they throw a big party at their home, this is where it gets messy. The family nanny sees a dog lurking nearby, a pitch black dog (a rottweiller?), for whatever reason the nanny seems impelled to take dramatic action, she goes to the first floor and wraps a noose around her neck and throws herself off the edge. But not before screaming something to the effect of ""This is all for you Damien!"" In the resultant chaos Damien spies the dog, still lurking, and gives him a friendly wave.At the party - and at most major events that occur to the family over the next cinematic hour - a photographer is snapping away all the while.A few days later in rolls Father Brennan to the embassy who asks to speak to Robert, who initially agrees. After he goes off on a bit of a tirade rabbitting on all sorts of ominous doomsday stuff, he is turfed.Enter the SuperNanny Mrs Baylock, she arrives unintroduced and unrequested at the home, and while she appears quite nice and professional you can tell immediately something ain't quite right with her (especially when she goes into Damien's room and it appears that she doesn't have any white parts in her eyes!) Evidence keeps building up against the poor little tacker, obviously the nanny suicide being exhibit A - for now...Over the ensuing few days: - A trip to church sends Damien into a cuckoo-bananas frenzy, forcing them to abandon the sermon and; - A day out at the local drive-through safari park shows Kathy that even animals have fear and hatred for Damien, especially the baboons who go (wait for it) apesh**.Initially Kathy blames herself for Damien and actually asks for psychological help for herself, where she claims that Damien is not her child, and that he is evil. You'd think that at this point the right thing to do would be for Robert to 'fess up but in his mind the lie got him this far, what more could go wrong? Father Brennan shows again at a local rugby match, telling Robert to meet him the following day for 5 minutes only as his wife is in danger. When Robert meets him Brennan spouts a lot of nonsensical sounding gibberish and tells him he must visit some guy to ""Tell him how to kill the child"". Upon parting ways, a storm flares up from nowhere and ""follows"" Father Brennan who seeks solace at a church, though things don't go so well for him when there The straw that breaks the camel's back is when Damien is fanging around the first floor on his tricycle and seemingly makes a beeline for Kathy as she stands on a table watering houseplants. This scene is quite famous and has been parodied a few times, there are many quick cuts between Damien, Mrs Baylock and an oblivious Kathy, and when she falls off the balcony the camera follows her to the floor.I don't feel that I'm giving too much away to this point when the poster has a picture of the boy with glowing red eyes. Damien is Satan's spawn.There I said it.Anyway once the photographer gets involved and contacts Robert things heat up, Robert decides to investigate for his family's sake and this takes him on a long quest first to a hospital in Rome, then a monastery, then an abandoned cemetery, and finally a city near Jerusalem. He must have racked up some frequent flyer miles! The climax is slightly tacky after such a prolonged deliberate build up and almost felt like a let down, but the final scene was effective and set up the sequel which was apparently inevitable even though this film was made in 1978, and sequelitis wasn't yet rampant in Hollywood.Even after a movie which dealt with the son of Satan and his attempt to take over the world by using a small boy, I was never actually scared or even nervous watching the movie. I might remind you that The Exorcist came out before this film and it was very edgy and way more scary than this, but The Omen was well acted and for some reason I like movies that pose theological questions or theories.Final Rating – 7 / 10. Perhaps hasn't aged that well and gore hounds look elsewhere, but a well made film and worth a look to escape the usual ""High School Cannibal Cheerleaders 11 - IN 3D!!"".If you liked this review (or even if you didn't) check out oneguyrambling.com",The Omen
110,xredgarnetx,"Entertaining horror movie, albeit somewhat dated",7,21 June 2006,"Richard (""Lethal Weapon""/""Superman"") Donner's THE OMEN is one of the most literate horror movies ever made, and to its credit the recent remake was an equally classy affair, an almost scene-for-scene replay that used large dollops of David Seltzer's original dialog. In the original, Gregory Peck and Lee Remick play an ambassdor and his wife living abroad who have a child who turns out to be not all that he's cracked up to be. People start dying around the tyke, and it slowly dawns on Peck and Remick that the kid is not exactly human. This unusually intelligent son-of-Satan potboiler has all the requisites of a '70s horror flick, including a plethora of violent deaths and several ominous moments. It also has, in Peck and Remick, along with David Warner as a suspicious photographer and Billie Whitelaw as the kid's sinister nanny, the best cast ever to grace a horror flick. This elevated THE OMEN to ""A"" status. Now, as to the film's faults: satanic plots are not to everyone's taste, and they can quickly get boring, so the audience for this will be limited. It's not like watching JAWS or Texas CHAINSAW MASSACRE or NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD or HALLOWEEN. The '70s photography. film stock and certain uncorrected sound sequences are badly dated by today's standards. And I hate to say it, but Peck and Remick are way too old to be the parents of this infernal baby. Fact is, they were old enough to play the kid's grandparents. This unfortunate situation was corrected in the remake with the casting of the much more youthful Liev Schreiber and Julia Styles in the Peck and Remick roles. I also must admit I have never been a big fan of satanic movies, so kudos to master director Donner for keeping me awake through most of this mini-masterpiece.",The Omen
111,PimpinAinttEasy,A pretty overrated horror movie .....,6,13 May 2014,"Frankly, THE OMEN is a bit overrated in my opinion. GREGORY PECK is too dour. There was no chemistry between him and LEE REMICK. And the photographer suspecting paranormal forces based on photographs was hard to digest. I couldn't believe that all these seemingly rational (albeit mildly religious) people were ready to believe in the influence of Satan. Unlike in THE EXORCIST, the parents being forced to believe in demonic influences were not convincing enough.Overall, the parts were better than the whole. Some of the frames looked like paintings and there are some interesting directorial flourishes. I bet they spent a bomb on this. But it really is not in the same league as say THE EXORCIST or THE SHINING. This was a re-watch and I was underwhelmed, I remember liking it a lot when I watched it as a teenager.(6.5/10)",The Omen
112,Sirus_the_Virus,A great horror film.,10,10 October 2009,"One of my all time favorite horror films is The Omen.The Omen is a very scary and original film. Director Richard Donner directed this classic film. Any film that has to do with demonic stuff just creeps me out. The Omen is the story of Robert Thorn(Gregory Peck) and his wife(Lee Remick). After his wife has a miscarriage, Robert decides not to tell her and adopts a new child. Named Damien.Damien, Robert, and his wife decide move to London because Robert is an ambassador. On Damien's birthday one year, a woman commits suicide. After that, a bunch of other bad things start to happen. Soon, Robert becomes under the impression that his son is the son of the devil. He also learns a bunch of other horrible truths.The Omen is a creepy ass film. Most of the horror films nowadays blow. But I still try to remember ones like this, and this really is a genius film. Richard Donner has directed many great movies such as Lethal weapon and surprisingly, The Goonies. The Omen is one of the best horror films ever. The Omen:****/****",The Omen
113,mossgrymk,the omen,7,26 August 2021,"Criticizing a movie that made gazillions of dollars and obviously entertained and frightened gazillions of people seems rather pointless so I'll just say of this decently made ""Exorcist"" spinoff that there shoulda been a lot more Damien and a lot less of Greg Peck and David Warner tooling around Italy and visiting priests and monks. As it stands now it's as if ""The Bad Seed"" were ""The Bad Seedling"". Oh well, I guess they were waiting till the kid was more grown up in the sequels. B minus.",The Omen
114,PatrynXX,Better than The Exorcist,8,30 December 2001,"Spoilers?   Heck for a movie like The Omen, you know the ending.I liked this better than The Exorcist.  And also consider it better than The Exorcist.  Everyone seems to think The Exorcist is one of the scariest films of all time.

115,Stephen_A_Abell,666 The Number Of... Damien. Or... Who's Your Daddy? Lucifer's My Daddy.,10,6 March 2021,"Greetings and salutations, and welcome to my review of 1976s The Omen.Before I get into the review, here are my ratings for the movie.The story gets 2 out of 2:
The Direction a 2:
The Pacing receives a 2:
While the Acting gets 1.75:
And my Enjoyment level earns a 2 out of 2:
The Omen, therefore, receives a total of 9.75 out of 10.Now, this is how to make a horror film. The story has so many twists, turns, and reveals that it's never boring. The Omen is the ultimate ""Child of Satan"" movie. When the American Ambassador and his wife lose their baby son in childbirth, a catholic priest offers Robert Thorn an alternative solution. Thorn's wife, Katherine, will be heartbroken at the death of their child. Therefore, Father Spiletto and the nurses arrange a rapid adoption for them. An unmarried mother has died in childbirth. Fortunately for the Ambassador, her orphaned child is a son. Thinking of his wife's happiness, he agrees to the adoption.But things in this hospital are not what they appear to be.The years go by, and the Ambassador and his family reside in England.The Thorns are the image of an ideal adoring family. Until Damien's fifth birthday; and the arrival of an unusual hound. Things start to follow a more sinister path in their idyllic life, which begins with the nanny's suicide of love.The writer, David Seltzer, throws pretty much everything into the story. A couple of priests seeking redemption; a photographer who snaps premonition photographs; a nanny who's so perfect and outwardly caring that it's scary as hell; and the shocking truth about Damien's birth. It certainly is a change from the usual one-trick pony horrors of today.
Another visible difference is the direction.Richard Donner presents the audience with a delight for the eyes. Every scene is superbly structured and crafted. He applies light and shadows superbly and isn't afraid to use various camera angles. A lot of the scenes in The Omen are near perfect. My favourite of the lot is when Thorn meets the priest, Brennan. Father Brennan highlights the danger his wife faces. Fighting against believing the impossible, Thorn orders the priest to leave and never bother him again, then walks away. No sooner has the priest left his seat than a mysterious wind starts blowing. As he backs down the path, Donner establishes to the audience that the strange wind is following Brennan's departure. Scared, he runs across a park. As the fall leaves billow across the scene, Donner moves the camera back and up until it stops behind a tree branch. As lightning flashes, we're showed a close-up of the priest, then a distant shot showing the lightning splitting the tree limb in two. The priest flees for the sanctuary of his church. Donner films the fleeing priest at a slightly upward angle. The distorted shot adds to the feeling of dread and unease. Donner kept the pace of this sequence brisk to build tension and excitement. I won't tell you what happens from here as I hate adding spoilers, especially when the film is so enjoyable. I will say, the director completes the sequence with a harsh full stop and halts on the last image for a few seconds. This stillness adds to the chill.Donner, Is brilliant with pace. As stated above, he knows how to handle action, tension, and uneasiness. In a few scenes, he slows the pace to a near excruciating slowness. Which. in turn, ramps up the suspense and tension. This film was a pleasure to watch.The only reason I don't rush to see this film more often is because I appear to have a Gregory Peck aversion. I don't understand why, but I don't like the guy. When I see his name on the roll call, my heart sinks, and I seriously think, do I need to watch this film now? What's more peculiar is he's the lead in some of my most loved movies' To Kill A Mockingbird, Cape Fear, and The Omen. Stranger still is that he's a superb actor.In The Omen, Peck plays Thorn, the Ambassador. And he nails it. Peck possesses a natural air of a refined American gentleman, which is ideal for this role. What should be more appealing is he doesn't shy away from the action. Though, a couple of times in the graveyard, and the dog attack, scenes you can see it's a stunt man, the rest of the time, it's Peck. And I have to provide him credit for man-handling Damien. Some actors may have requested a slight change here. Though what Peck and the director delivers is an honest and realistic vision.David Warner, on the other hand, is an actor I'll always watch. His portrayal of the photographer, Jennings, is spot on. Though the character isn't too deep, you don't distrust him when he wholeheartedly accepts the Son of Satan story. Even though his new friend, the Ambassador, is still having doubts. His belief in Damian is forged in the man's search for the truth. He didn't have to look into the story so deep. But when he did, the evidence was overwhelming for him, and a believer was born.Apart from The Omen, I've not caught Lee Remick in any other movie that
I can remember. And, that in itself says a lot. She's an okay actress, and the role of Katherine suits her well. Though at times, I thought she needed to add a tad more to her portrayal.I've always liked Billie Whitelaw, and she made the nanny's character her own. She comes across as being so nice and correct that it's difficult to consider her evil. Until she gets into defence mode. At which time, you can see the slight madness and hatred in her eyes.And my favourite Dr Who, Patrick Troughton, is sublime as Father Brennan. I do like an actor who can immediately immerse the audience in their character. Troughton didn't do stereotypical. Peck and Warner, in some ways, retain their essence in their characterisations. But Troughton and Whitelaw convey an entirely new and whole character, with little or none of themselves in the role.The Omen still is one of the outstanding Horror films that every Horror fan and connoisseurs should have in their collection. Along with the series sequels and the novels. If you're a newbie to the genre or you've not watched this film yet, do yourself a favour and obtain a copy. If you hitherto possess a copy, then brush off the dust and slide it into the machine... unless you likewise express a Gregory Peck aversion.Come on over to my Absolute Horror list and see where the Son of Satan birthed in my rankings... but watch out for spooky kids on tricycles.Take Care & Stay Well.",The Omen
116,Richie-67-485852,Bad Sign Good Movie,10,8 April 2017,"For its time, it thrilled and chilled and had people talking and wondering. Today, we refer to it as good entertainment and it still is. Helping the movie along is Gregory Peck which brings believability to the story as the character he plays is not easily persuaded about anything. That allows the story-line to develop and become tense as we watch him first reject and then reconsider the different signs and ""omens"" that come to pass. Along the way, all characters leave their signature acting which makes for a solid flow of good movie. Also helping the viewer to settle in and buy this story premise is the chilling music score that comes along at the right time. It has the effect of making you stare at the screen so as not to miss anything coming. That's what you do! Effective use of a good story has never failed to be worth the price of an admission to the movie-goer and this is no exception. One can only wonder what it was like to go see this on the big screen and just devour popcorn like there was no tomorrow. Enjoy how it unfolds rather nicely but pay attention in the beginning. I like watching movies with the captions on which literally captures all the dialogue some of it crucial to understanding the movie plot. Snack recommended, tasty drink and have your bible handy just in case you manage to really buy all this as presented and scare yourself silly",The Omen
117,Karl Self,Omenious!,7,14 October 2008,"I really like the sober style of this movie, and how it tells a pretty garish and over-the-top story with a minimum of special effects. It is also very convincing in how it paints a cute child as the incarnation of evil which has to be slaughtered to save the world -- and is therefore not exactly recommended viewing for paranoid schizophrenics. The child's evilness is related convincingly without resorting to gimmicks such as glowing eyes-SFX or stuff flying through the air. Last but not least, the Omen is a classic which ought to be seen just because of the large impact it has had on popular culture. The acting is also very good.Unfortunately the story-telling isn't all that great, and especially in the segment when the ambassador is trying to get to the bottom of his son's origin I couldn't make sense of what was going on -- who is that photographer, why did the hospital burn down, etc. And it never comes out why the movie is called ""The Omen"" in the first place.But still, it's the rare example of a scary movie which is enjoyable, intelligent -- and really scary.",The Omen
118,vip_ebriega,"Even if it won't be considered a classic in the future, THE OMEN is still a superior mystery thriller.",9,7 February 2007,"My Take: An effectively creepy thriller with convincing performances and memorably gruesome murders.I picked up the copy of ""The Omen"" when I was looking for a decent horror movie to watch. I didn't know much about the story when I bought it, all I know is that it was about a devil child and his plot to wreck havoc upon the Earth. I didn't expect much when I first saw it, I wouldn't even think I would understand the story. But when I finally watched it, I no doubt enjoyed it a lot. ""The Omen"" was such a great horror story, that I watched it countless times.""The Omen"" goes beyond the expected story. American ambassador of Britain (played excellently by Gregory Peck) adopts a seemingly simple child in order to replace the stillborn baby. Lee Remick gives a great performance as the unknowing wife Kathryn, Billie Whitelaw is eerie as the Thorns' governess. And David Warner is fine as the doomed Keith Jennings. Oh! And the performance by Patrick Troughton, as the damned Father Brennan, deserves some credit.But much of the credit goes to child star Harvey Stephens in the role of Damien, the adopted son of the Thorns', who is prophesied to be the Antichrist, the son of Satan. Stephens gives enough chills as Damien. Unlike the others who played Damien in the sequel and the kid who played him in the 2006 remake, Stephens looks more like a normal-looking boy, which makes it the more chilling and mysterious. On the other hand, the other Damiens look immediately like strange-looking boys, which makes it much easier to tell who's who.Other credits goes to Jerry Goldsmith's Oscar-winning score which really goes with the film's disturbing atmosphere, Gilbert Taylor's magnificent work behind camera and Richard Donner's superb direction.This suspenseful horror tale really kicks. The sequels lack the kick of the original but still watchable. But still, the original is still the very best.A real classic. Rating: ****1/2 out of 5.",The Omen
119,one9eighty,Oc-cult classic supernatural thriller from the 70's,8,8 October 2018,"It's 1976 and Richard Donner (you may know him from his ""Superman"" films) directs what would later be the 5th highest grossing films of the year, and a cult classic which would be discussed many many years later, and it would spawn sequels and a (bad) remake forty years later.The Omen is an intelligent film (for Hollywood), both with its plot, and the delivery of events and information. On the 6th of June, at 6am, two children are born. One doesn't survive birth, while the mother of the other child doesn't survive child birth. A swap is done to allow the baby to have a family and the mother (played by Lee Remick) to have a baby. While everything initially seems normal it turns out that strange events and circumstances follow the family, and in particularly the child - Damien (Harvey Stephens). It unfolds that the child could be the mortal vessel for the son of Satan which would ultimately bring about the end of days. Not wanting to believe it, the father, the US Ambassador (Gregory Peck), starts on a fact finding mission, but danger is never far away. As he delves into the source of his adopted child it becomes clear that he's out of his depths and will have to make some serious decisions if he were to survive.This is a great film that uses the unseen to terrorise, as much as some of the things which do unfold on screen - it has a lot of power in its visuals and its score (by Jerry Goldsmith).Experienced actors, such as Gregory Peck, give this film a totally credible feel, despite some of the unfeasible explanations given out in the narrative. The pace of the film is decent; it uses a montage of still photographs to advance the infant to toddler years early on so it can have a disturbance happen early on in Act 1, setting things up for how the film is going to proceed. The audience uses Gregory Peck as a pacing tool, often discovering things the same time as him, or using him as an emotional thermometer on the occasion it discovers something before he does. It manages to build up tension and suspense, and due to the climax of the film, its tension and suspense that transcends the finale of screen time. I really enjoy this film, it may not have aged that successfully in the 40-50 years since its release, but it's still a damn good film - and that's the reason it's still considered a cult classic all these years later. It takes a simple enough story, sticks to it without veering off to much, it's delivered with quality, and wrapped up with a polished look and sound. 8 out of 10.",The Omen

121,CharltonBoy,Without a doubt this is scarier than the exorcist.,9,16 July 2001,I remember watching The Omen when i was a kid and being a big horror fan at the time this film had i great impact on me. I remember it wasn't until i was in my twenties that i could actually watch the be heading scene without looking away! 25 years on since this film was made it is still as brilliant as it was back when i was a kid. For me this is a lot scarier than The Exorcist . Maybe that is because i only saw the latter last year and didnt see it as a child. The Omen is most memorable for 3 things in my opinion. 1. the death scene very frightening. they are filmed so so well that they make you jump even if you know they are going to happen. 2.The casting of the child that played Damien. This kid really does look evil especially the very last scene. 3.The musical score is magnificent.The haunting latin chanting is as scary as some of the scenes and i wonder without the music would the Omen have been such a hit? Horrific but brilliant. 9 out of 10.,The Omen
122,jluis1984,Excellent tale of horror and suspense!,8,6 August 2007,"As the dominant faiths of the Western hemisphere, the Abrahamic religions (mainly Christianity and Judaism) have played an important role as source of inspiration for many art forms through the centuries. In the narrative arts, they have inspired all kinds of stories, as their cosmology is so complex that can be used in almost everything, from moral fables to epic tales. Obviously, they have also inspired many horror stories, mainly because the three have a definitive personification of evil in the figure of the Devil, which makes an excellent villainous character due to its many different traits. Naturally, the Devil and its followers have been villains in horror films since almost the beginnings of cinema, however, it was during the decades of the 60s and 70s when three of the most influential horror movies about the Devil were made: ""Rosemary's Baby"", ""The Exorcist"", and ""The Omen"".""The Omen"" begins in Rome on June 6, 1966, when American ambassador Robert Thorn (Gregory Peck) receives the news that his new son has been stillborn. Devastated by the news, Thorn worries about how will this affect his wife Katherine (Lee Remick), so when he is offered the chance to adopt a newborn baby whose mother died giving birth to him, he accepts and decides not to tell a word to his wife. Years go by and everything seems happy for the Thorn family, with Robert quickly ascending in the political arena while his son, named Damien (Harvey Stephens) grows up apparently normally. However, on Damien's fifth birthday, his young Nanny (Holly Palance) hangs herself mysteriously in front of everyone. This will be only the first of many strange events surrounding Damien, making Robert begin to suspect that there's something unnatural in his son.Written by David Seltzer, ""The Omen"" mixes drama, horror and suspense by mixing cleverly an apocalyptic theme with a concept that was very popular in horror stories during the 60s and the 70s: the ""evil child"". While obviously inspired by the success of ""The Exorcist"" and ""Rosemary's Baby"", Seltzer gives to his story a new angle closer in spirit to movies like ""Village of the Damned"", as in ""The Omen"", the kid is not a victim or a tool of the supernatural evil, but truly the embodiment of evil. Due to this, Seltzer wisely bases most of the movie's drama around the dilemma that consumes Damien's father, who can't help but see innocence in his beloved son, as well as in the consequences of his doubts and his search for answers. This serious approach, together with strong character development, give the film a powerful sense of realism, which in turn truly makes it a haunting experience.With ""The Omen"", director Richard Donner had the first major success of his career, and it's not difficult to see why, as while Seltzer's script is truly inspired, credit should go to Donner as the man responsible for ""The Omen""'s overall style. Knowing that the strength of the script lays in the realism of its human drama, Donner keeps a restrained style in ""The Omen"", and handles the supernatural themes with a subtle elegance that helps to create a haunting atmosphere of dread that fits nicely within the apocalyptic theme of the film. While all we see is a little child, Donner skillful use of Gilbert Taylor's cinematography and the eerie score by Jerry Goldsmith, makes it seem as if it was truly the beginning of the end of the world. Donner's directing of his cast also plays an instrumental role in this, as he brings out strong and realistic performances out of them.Leading the cast is Gregory Peck, delivering a terrific performance as U.S. ambassador Robert Thorn, the unsuspecting adoptive father of the Antichrist. As usual, Peck gives his character a lot of humanity, as well as his commanding presence. While Peck is initially a bit wooden in his performance, this kind of fits nicely in his role as an upcoming politician who must take the most difficult decision a father has to face. As Thorne's wife Katherine, Lee Remick is equally as effective as Peck, playing Damien's troubled mother with great realism. However, it is Billie Whitelaw who steals the movie as the sinister Mrs. Baylock, Damien's new nanny who is completely willing to do whatever is necessary to help Damien to rule the world. Whitelaw's performance is truly haunting, and while a bit over-the-top at times, she portrays one of the best horror villains of the 70s.It's pretty easy to criticize the many inconsistencies between the movie and the biblical sources that inspired its main plot, however, to label the film as pretentious or inaccurate in its portrayal of Christian imagery would be pretty ignorant and ultimately pointless, as ""The Omen"" never intends to be a representation of any biblical story or theological prophecy, as it's only a fictional tale of horror and suspense inspired by them. What truly can be criticized about the film are the small but numerous plot holes that appear from time to time through the film, certainly minor yet noticeable problems that could had been easily avoided with a bit more of care in the development of the script. The movie's extremely slow pace doesn't help in this, as while it allows Donner more development for his characters, it also makes the movie be a bit boring at times.It's difficult not to compare this movie to ""Rosemary's Baby"" and ""The Exorcist"", as the fact that ""The Omen"" was obviously inspired by those two masterpieces of horror is hard to ignore. But even when it may come as inferior when compared to those classics, ""The Omen"" still is one of the best horror films produced by a major studio during the 70s, thanks in part to the classy style Donner added to the film. It's true that ""The Omen"" hasn't aged well, but more than 30 years after its release, it remains a powerful and haunting experience. 8/10",The Omen
123,The_Movie_Cat,"""God has given you a son.""",7,31 October 2000,"Who remembers early eighties television series ""Jigsaw""? Truly a children's programme of disturbing content. There was co-presenter Adrian who never spoke  was he telepathic, or a Michael Myers-style psychopathic killer? There was a yellow-headed man, years before The Simpsons, with a large nose and an evil stare. A real Hieronymus Bosch monstrosity, he used to give me nightmares for years. But perhaps most terrifying of all were the dwarf and the Scotsman (David Rappaport and Sylvester McCoy) who used to appear dressed as superheroes whenever anyone used to say a succession of eight words with a ""double o"" in the middle. They were the ""O Men"", and they were, to young minds, unsettling. Conversely, The Omen, while a finely made film, lacks this one vital spark  the ability to scare or unnerve.Despite what you may have heard, it's a surprise to find that the film's basis, Damien, doesn't actually appear that much at all, perhaps just around fifteen minutes in total. This takes away the need for a strong child actor, and tells the story through the eyes of the adults. Central character then is Gregory Peck, who brings a strong performance to the role of ineffectual Ambassador who has little control over the events around him. He's backed up by a superb cast all the way, especially notable for the triumvirate of Billie Whitelaw (who played a similar character, if diametrically opposed, in The Water Babies), Patrick Troughton and Leo McKern.The crafting of the story, and the direction, is virtually faultless. Indeed, it's hard to believe that the director of this one went on to make mainstream, though still notable, films such as the first Superman and the quartet of Lethal Weapon movies. So successful was the movie (Over a $100 million profit from $8.8 million budget - including $6 million on the publicity campaign) that two reasonable sequels were released within five years. The second in particular was an adequate view, with more than a passing debt to Hitchcock and a genuinely surprising twist. We really don't have to mention the TV movie Omen IV here do we? Yet what all three films have in common is that the central character of Damien just isn't that scary as portrayed. Indeed, he doesn't even acknowledge his own nature until it's pointed out to him in the second, so the rather podgy little boy fails to generate fear. When he knocks his mother over a stair rail, it's less like the demonic work of the antichrist, more the clumsy-footed antics of a token fat kid. Also defying the myth built around the series is the incidental music. While strong, and often over the top, it lacks a clear theme and does not, as spoofs would have it, feature a particular passage of music that was used to advertise aftershave.The film is excellently acted, well written and strongly directed. Almost outstanding on every level, it's just a shame it doesn't deliver on the one that matters most  the ability to scare. 7/10.",The Omen
124,krorie,Proud Parents Of A Little Devil,10,24 November 2005,"This is equal to or better than ""Rosemary's Baby,"" depending on your tastes. It certainly is one of the great Hollywood horror movies. Don't waste your time on the three sequels. ""The Omen"" is the only Damien film that is worth seeing, unless you have nothing better to do. It has the scariest graveyard scene on film. Those rottweilers still give me the willies each time I watch the flick. And unless you've read the book already the surprise of what Robert Thorn and Keith Jennings find when they open the mother's grave is horrendous. There are several other almost equally frightening parts. Watch out for the baboons.The movie plays like a Greek tragedy. The Book of Revelations states what is to happen. The Greeks called it fate. Christians call it prophesy. Doris Day called it ""Que sera, sera."" There is no cop out at the end. Director Richard Donner sticks to his guns and delivers shock after shock.Who could ask for a better cast? Gregory Peck plays his character to perfection. He could very well be the U.S. ambassador to the Court of St. James. The standout performance is given by Billie Whitelaw in the meaty role of Mrs. Baylock, the devil's own. She has to compete with the devil dog who almost steals the show. This movie is not for the squeamish. If you like edge of the seat terror and suspense, get ready for a winner. The eerie music by Jerry Goldsmith, third to Bernard Herrman's ""Psycho"" score and John Carpenter's ""Halloween"" music, only adds to the chills. And Whatever happened to young Harvey Stephens who plays Damien? Look closely at your Presidential ballot in 2008.",The Omen
125,fernandoschiavi,"The Omen may not even be seen as a classic, but it remains one of the most beloved examples of psychological horror works of the 70s",8,16 October 2021,"The Exorcist, Rosemary's Baby and The Omen. These three films have a lot in common, from the fact that they are productions that address themes related to the figure of the devil, through the use of children and babies as agents of terror and the presence of some of the greatest actors and directors in the history of cinema. But above all, these three have the privilege of consistently appearing at the top of many lists of the best horror movies of all time. The Omen is the weak link in this chain. It's not about questioning that it's a movie that should be seen by any self-respecting horror fan, but rather pointing out some flaws that end up putting it on a level below the other movies mentioned, and also some others that deserve more. Wanders in that trinity (such as Satanic Heart, The Marriage of Satan, and The Watcher of the Damned).When The Omen was released, almost 40 years ago, in the exact year of 1976, the public was still in an uproar with the repercussion of The Exorcist, which was responsible for causing several nauseating effects and (some say) irreversible effects on the public, plus all the tragic and mysterious events that probed the filming of William Friedkin's film. With that in mind, the success that Richard Donner's first film, who until then had very little behind-the-scenes experience, achieved is laudable, as the production was in serious danger of falling into the shadow of The Exorcist's feat.Many venture to say that, when it comes to horror movies that use Christian mythologies as a basis, The Prophecy is the one that best worked with all these elements. Based on a book by David Selzer (and who also wrote the script for the film), the story introduces us to the couple Robert and Katherine Thorn (stars Gregory Peck and Lee Remick), whose first child ends up dying in childbirth. Fearing that such a tragedy could affect his wife forever, Robert lies to his wife and adopts a child whose mother had died the same night, and introduces the child to Katherine as the couple's newborn child. Years later, a series of mysterious events begin to envelop Damien's (Harvey Stephens) christened child, until Robert hears through the mysterious priest Brennan (Patrick Troughton) the chilling possibility that Damien may be the son of the anti -Christ.Biblical texts have always found space in cinema, usually through narratives that focused on the first books, the saga of Moses or the creation of the world. With the events that took over the social scene of the 1960s, people began to be interested in the disasters and predictions pointed out in the Apocalypse. The emergence of the Satanic Bible, by Anton Lavey, as well as natural disasters, such as floods, earthquakes and unknown diseases that devastated society and won the news, in addition to the wars and conflicts that gripped the world, were facts that marked deeply the period, having the cinema as one of the channels of reflections of these anxieties. By bringing The Prophecy to the core of the film's production, we realized that the war between good and evil reached devastating proportions.David Seltzer's screenplay was successful because it was cut. Initially titled The Antichrist, purchased by Warner, however, because it was too similar to The Exorcist, it was shelved. A clause in the contract said that if the production didn't take place, it should go back to the writer. So he left for FOX. The producer asked them to remove the excesses: no witchcraft, no goat's paws. The focus should be on dialogues based on the sacred scriptures and on growing tension, aiming for a sharp dramatic turn at the end.On the positive points of the film, the cast is perfect, especially the couple Peck and Remick, he composing the image of a powerful man caught in a whirlwind of inexplicable events, and she explaining the fragility of the loving mother who gradually realizes that her son is a monster. Three dots, however, form the icing on the cake of The Prophecy: Billie Whitelaw, as the mysterious Mrs. Baylock, possesses a frightening and chilling presence on the scene from her very first moment, swallowing the attention for herself the moment she appears. Notice how the actress works on her posture and gaze, something that Donner delightfully highlights with her camera when she makes use of close-up close-ups. Harvey Stephen follows the same path, where the child actor is able to precisely mix an aura of innocence and maleficence in his angelic face and suggestive smile. However, the apex is even the soundtrack by Jerry Goldsmith, responsible for the only Oscar snapped up by the film. Using male choirs that sing satanic passages in Latin (sometimes backwards), the score is capable of raising the hairs of even the most resistant audience, highlighting the dramatic potential achieved by the work.Richard Donner's direction is superb, especially for a director who doesn't have very strong roots in horror. With the limited number of resources at hand, he goes in search of simple artifices to reach the viewer, such as close-ups in the eyes of the characters, tricks and camera positions that value the claustrophobia of some scenarios and a wonderful play of light and shadows, which gives us the constant feeling that something really evil stalks the characters. Donner has also filmed some of the genre's most impactful graphic violence scenes that are born classics, such as the nanny hanging, Jennings' beheading and Kathy's murder. It's a brilliant crafting job. Along the way, the director still finds time to give small nuances of humanity to the characters, which makes the story truer and, therefore, more frightening, as the viewer feels that it could actually be happening. A good example is the way Donner shows the pain of little Damien's mother, when she starts to move away from her son, after noticing the little boy's malignant tics.Furthermore, the script moves from scene to scene in a suspenseful crescendo that leads to one of the most original and intelligent climaxes in the genre. Some of the moments are among the most disturbing of the horror B movies. Watch little Damien's terrifying visit to the zoo, for example, and try not to be impressed by the giraffes and monkeys' reaction to the boy. Another spectacular scene is the dark passage of Thorn and Jennings through the dismal Etruscan cemetery, where they make a potentially explosive discovery. These and other scenes built with classic lighting, architecture and deep ambiance, both in the studio and on location in Rome, cradle of Christianity, which give a solemn air to the film, as well as some shots in London, make the film a classy masterpiece. The art direction is another highlight of the film, highlighting a room lined with Bible pages and the Gothic choices in mirrors in the interiors and architectural details in the exterior spaces.However, the script has a lot of holes. The biggest one is the way people who stand in the way of Antichrist are killed. The screenwriter David Seltzer doesn't make up his mind: sometimes Satan's followers like Mrs. Baylock need to intervene, sometimes the killers are supernatural forces, like the lightning bolt that knocks down the stake impaling Father Brennan. The devil also suffers from timing: why let Brennan tell Thorn everything she knows and then kill him? Wouldn't it be easier to just hurl lightning at him (or send one of his followers) before the priest revealed everything, which would save the cramullion a lot of work? Another frustrating detail is the way the film portrays the horned followers: all of them (not just Damien) are predestined who are born with the 666 mark tattooed on their skin. Now isn't it much more frightening that anyone can be seduced into the darkness (as Rosemary's Baby has brilliantly shown) than to be born with this stigma? This somewhat erases the tempting face of Evil, although it's interesting how Father Spiletto's character tries to fight his fate.The legacy of The Omen is enormous, capable of being published in a book with numerous pages. As pointed out in documentaries and television programs dedicated to the film, production accounted for the emergence of the Star Wars franchise. Fox was in financial trouble on a large scale, and the film took a new direction for the studio. The story became comic books, reached vast space in pop culture, found resonances in several other films about ""cursed or cursed"" children, in addition to having won a remake and a television series. The work may not even be seen as a classic, but it remains one of the most beloved examples of psychological horror works of the 70s.Furthermore, it is often seen as part of a thought-provoking trilogy about the earthly life of the supposed Antichrist. As with the controversial The Exorcist, the film also carries its own tragedies during filming (several accidents occurred with some involved in the production, and actor Gregory Peck's own son committed suicide shortly before filming began), but the difference is that, here, the quality of the work can speak louder.",The Omen
126,cchase,Scaring The Hell Into You...,9,12 February 2006,"With the stratospheric success of THE EXORCIST at the box office, it was only a matter of time before Hollywood got a case of the Imitation Blues, and everybody started cranking out pictures about Mr. Scratch, a.k.a. The Evil One, Lucifer, Satan, etc. Leave it to two television vets - writer David Seltzer and director Richard Donner - to come up with the best of the lot.Like its pea-soup stained predecessor, THE OMEN has become so ingrained into the lexicon of pop culture, that it's almost inconceivable for someone not to know anything about it. But just in case you don't: Robert Thorn (Gregory Peck) and his beautiful wife Kathy (Lee Remick) have always wanted a child, but have had a previously unsuccessful attempt at conception. Anguished by the latest miscarriage, Robert is desperate to go to any lengths to avoid the complete emotional destruction of his beloved spouse by this latest tragedy. When someone makes him an offer that is outlandish yet irresistible, and that someone is a priest, Robert in his desperation decides to make a deal with the devil. Literally.And what he and Kathy thought was a healthy, bouncing baby boy, turns out to be the human manifestation of The Anti-Christ. Which becomes more apparent as warnings, signs and some pretty spectacular deaths pile up around the Thorn family, as those invested in the rise of the Devil's son to power will stop at nothing to ensure that the prophecy is fulfilled at any cost.Gee, and Rosemary Woodehouse thought SHE had problems! Basically, you've got your B-movie plot line with a lot of pseudo-religious hoo-ha mixed in, and the results could've been laughable. But the main three points that give this movie the gravitas and believability that make it so frightening, are the straight-faced, no-nonsense performances of Peck and Remick, and Jerry Goldsmith's ominous, Oscar-winning score.Because the leads are so strong in their roles, every single cast member follows suit, and the result is one goosebump-raising time at the movies. What could've seemed like rank overacting suddenly becomes very engaging and terrifying, with special kudos to David Warner, Billie Whitelaw, Patrick Troughton, little Harvey Stephens, of course, (who evokes chilling memories of a certain little Miss McCormack) and a terrific yet uncredited Leo McKern (the BBC's RUMPOLE OF THE BAILEY) as demon hunter Bugenhagen.Donner, with ample help from cinematographer Gil Taylor, invests nearly the entire film with an impending sense of dread and doom, especially as the forces of good battle against seemingly insurmountable odds to tackle their Satanic opponents. But add Goldsmith's malevolently majestic soundtrack, and it clinches the deal for the nightmares that so many people had well after this movie had stretched into three (!!!) more sequels. There were folks I spoke to who were more terrified of this film than THE EXORCIST and ROSEMARY'S BABY put together.By investing in a solid cast, a tightly constructed script and doing whatever it took to make a limited budget look like a mega-blockbuster on screen, Donner and Company took what could have been a camp-fest and turned it into a creepy classic for the ages. SO classic, as a matter of fact, that now it has actually spawned a new (and probably unnecessary) remake.I don't envy the producers of the new version one little bit. Gentlemen, you have a big, red-hot pair of pointy shoes to fill....",The Omen

I'm talking about gruesome death methods!What makes this film such a blast are several factors including cast, plot, soundtrack, London set scenes, pre CGI special effects and possibility for sequels.The cast includes the late (now, it was made nigh on 40 years ago) Gregory Peck in one of his later films.The supporting cast are excellent and include David Warner who has an extensive film and TV filmography.UK readers might be more aware of Billie Whitelaw and Patrick Troughton.The music score is award winning by composer Jerry Goldsmith. I later learned he was awarded an Oscar for this effort.I recently mentioned John Williams excellent efforts in Jaws. Goldsmith deserves credit for this film. He also has an extensive filmography.Basically the film follows some very strange happenings around Ambassador Robert Thorn (Peck) after he adopts a boy, Damien.Where has Damien come from?Who is Damian?Where has he gone at the end?One anomaly I noticed.

Unfortunately, the film is rather dated and a lot of its features which were original have been repeatedly copied in recent years.The music deserves a lot of praise because the soundtrack really is very iconic and very well designed and cinematography was rather dark and suitably so. The actual plot was a bit slow in parts and I have seen something of a similar ilk before but I appreciated it nonetheless even if it wasn't one of the best horror movies I've ever seen like some people say.7/10: Extraordinary when released but not as incredible now, worth a watch purely for its cinematic history and cultural values",The Omen

132,Darkside-Reviewer,This review is for you Damien,8,29 January 2021,The Omen (1976) is without a doubt one of most disturbingly creepy horror movies ever made. The Omen wasn't the first movie to depict the idea of an evil child. In 1973 (The Exorcist) was released into theatre's quickly becoming one of the most influential Horror movies ever made so much so that it inspired countless other classic Horror movies one of course being The Omen.The Omen tells the story of a wealthy political figure Robert Thorn (Gregory Peck) and his wife Katherine Thorn (Lee Remick) who sadly loose their only child during childbirth. On the same night Robert is given the opportunity to adopt an abandoned newborn baby boy who he plans on presenting to his wife as their new born son without his wife ever knowing. Robert accepts the offer to adopt the baby and presents him to his wife as their own baby. They name the child Damien Thorn (Harvey Spencer) and raise him as a seemingly normal child who is loved and wants for nothing. Then upon Damien's fifth birthday his behaviour suddenly begins to change and strange things begin to happen around him almost as if evil surrounds him at all times. Then after a violent incident accurs during Damien's fifth birthday party a mysterious preist named Father Brennan (Patrick Troughton) turns up in Roberts office and warns him that Damien is in fact the spawn of Satan himself and must be killed before it's too late.The very idea of a child being the spawn of Satan with the ability to manipulate those around them into doing unspeakable acts of pure evil. Aswell as the having the power to manipulate future events so people die in violent accidents. This is every parents worse nightmare to create a child that is pure evil in every way possible. The psychological aspect of the movies plot is what makes the idea so terrifying because while obviously the idea of sireing an antichrist child is pure fiction it is without a doubt every parents worse fear to have a child who would grow up to become an evil person.The creepy atmospheric music is what really sells the intense and frightening scenes in this movie. The camerawork by director Richard Donnar is phonominal really capturing the essence of the film in every shot. Every character is perfectly cast with everyone giving amazing and memorable performances that make this movie a true classic.I highly recommend watching The Omen at least once in your lifetime. While it may not be as exciting or action packed as modern day Horror movies sometimes it's nice to go back to the old movies that inspired them.,The Omen

134,virek213,The Coming Of The Antichrist,9,31 August 2002,"Following on the heels of such films as ROSEMARY'S BABY and THE EXORCIST, THE OMEN became one of the most commercially and artistically successful horror movies of all times.  Even today, after myriads of imitators and increasingly outrageous sequels, it stands as a masterful Satanic thriller.Under the excellent direction of Richard Donner, who later made SUPERMAN: THE MOVIE and the LETHAL WEAPON films, THE OMEN boasts a chilling storyline about the much-feared coming of the Antichrist, or Devil's Child.  That child is Damien, who has unwittingly been adapted by the U.S. ambassador (Gregory Peck) to England and his wife (Lee Remick).  When horrible things start happening, a priest (Patrick Troughton) tries to give Peck a warning about the child, a warning he disbelieves.  Not long after that, the priest is impaled during a freak storm.  Only after Remick ends up in the hospital in a suspicious accident at home engineered by Damien's nanny (Billie Whitelaw) does Peck start to investigate.  Along with a sympathetic journalist (David Warner), he makes inquiries to the priests and the nurses who engineered the adoption and comes to realize that Damien is, in fact, the Son of the Devil with a birthmark of ""666""--the Mark of the Beast--on his scalp.But even when told by a priest (Leo McKern) is Israel that the killing must be done on hallowed ground, he refuses vehemently.  Only after Warner is gruesomely decapitated does he go back to London for the ultimate confrontation between Good and Evil that could spell the end of the world.Despite a slight hectoring tone in its recitation of Biblical prophecies, David Seltzer's screenplay for THE OMEN is a benchmark of narrative invention, something that sets it apart from a lot of horror films, even THE EXORCIST.  The film is propelled by the actions of the characters and the excellent Oscar-winning orchestral/choral score by Jerry Goldsmith.  And with the one spectacular exception of the decapitation scene, the film's best-remembered set piece and still one of the most gruesome of its type, THE OMEN doesn't rely on gory special effects.  Peck, Remick, and Warner are extremely good and professional in their roles, and Whitelaw makes for a disturbing nanny.  Harvey Stephens plays Damien quite well...frighteningly well.Like THE EXORCIST and ROSEMARY'S BABY, THE OMEN was the subject of a great deal of controversy in religious circles, something that only helped to boost its box office; it eventually grossed $50 million, a not inconsiderable sum for 1976.  Horror film fans must get their hands on this movie, though children under seventeen must not be allowed to see the film unsupervised; it is rightly rated 'R' for explicit adult content and sometimes graphic violence.",The Omen
135,DonFishies,"Interesting, but has many boring moments",8,8 June 2006,"I had heard of it, but was never really intrigued enough to go out and watch The Omen. But when the remake was announced, I became interested, and even more so as the mythical 6/6/06 day was arriving. So in special ""celebration"" (not the right word, I know) of that day, I purchased up the original and watched it. While I was not terribly disappointed, I was not entirely impressed either.Robert Thorn (Gregory Peck) is an American Ambassador in Italy, whose wife Katherine (Lee Remick) has given birth to a stillborn baby, on June 6 at 6 A.M.. For the sake of his wife, Robert goes to an orphanage and adopts a new born child, who he brings to his wife, without ever telling her of the tragic death. They name him Damien, and soon after, the Thorns are moved to Britain. As Damien's fifth birthday comes though, a bizarre death occurs at his party, and even stranger things begin to happen soon afterwards, leading Robert to start believing that his son may be the Anti-Christ.While the film is not particularly scary, it is fairly tense. As the film goes along and the death toll rises, you cannot help but start believing what is going on is much more real than it may seem. Just the idea of the devil being born again in the body of a child is terrifying enough. And as a result, Richard Donner's production performs well, even thirty years later. David Seltzer's screenplay is well versed and well written. Even though you can predict what's coming, the writing is still very well done and well communicated. Jerry Goldsmith's score holds up well, if a little more dramatic than it should be.Peck is great as Robert, always questioning, and never truly knowing the truth. When emotional moments come however, his acting is not as reciprocal as it should be. But this is a great actor here, and he handles the material well, and never really messes it up. Remick is not bad, but falls to the wayside about halfway through, in order for Robert's investigation to really take hold of the film. David Warner does a great supporting turn as the photographer Keith Jennings, and for his short role, Patrick Troughton does great as Father Brennan.If I was disappointed at all with the cast, it would be the fact that Harvey Stephens' Damien and Billie Whitelaw's much discussed Mrs. Baylock are barely in the film. These are two of the creepiest characters in the horror/suspense genre, and they barely have any chances to show why. Of course, when they are on screen, they are fabulous, but those moments only come so few and far between the main story.If the film has anything wrong with it, it's the fact that there is so much in it, that it feels overly long (even at one hundred and eleven minutes). The film is totally interesting for the first half, but begins to get bogged down by a ton of exposition by the beginning of the second half. It drags out, and what should feel really shocking, really feels boring. Yes, the many moments that are supposed to strike us as horrific, do strike us that way. But the time that the film takes to get to it's eventual conclusion is really long. And even with the exposition, there are still way too questionable moments that are left unanswered.The film holds up and is very well made, but it could have used a bit of extra editing. The entire thing is very interesting, but some may get turned off by how strikingly boring the film becomes. I could only wish there was much more of Mrs. Baylock and Damien in the film too.7.5/10.(An extended review also appeared on http://www.geekspeakmagazine.com).",The Omen

Although he exhibits the exact same traits (dignity, patience, reserve) that won him an Oscar for playing Atticus Finch in ""To Kill A Mockingbird,"" he is wholly inappropriate and entirely unsympathetic in this film. A great actor adjusts, a great actor remains open to different characters, different styles, different genres of film... did Greg not realize that this was a horror movie?Here he plays an American Ambassador who adopts an infant named Damien, whom we later learn is the spawn of Satan. Notice I say WE learn... Mr. Peck is skeptical, and even after being warned by a priest, witnessing his nanny's senseless suicide, visiting the grave of Damien's canine mother, and discovering the death of his own wife he still isn't sure he's dealing with the genuine article. In a bad device direct from bad horror films, Greg has to check for the ""666"" birthmark in his son's scalp. Of course, by then it's too late...See Peck stiffen, and contain all emotion... see Peck go twenty screen minutes without changing his facial expression... see Peck conveniently declare he does not believe, just long enough for a main character to be killed off. I was very disappointed in this picture. I expected a horror classic but what I got was a spooky story stretched skinny and a reluctant lead whose main personality trait was being so THICK that it took him two hours to accept what everyone knew walking into the theater.

Robert Thorn (Gregory Peck) has just found out his newborn son is dead. He can't let his wife Katherine (Lee Remick) know though, since it would devastate her. But when a priest offers him another newborn whose mother died, all problems are solved, they name him Damien.....The Omen is one of my favourite horror films. When I first saw it, it scared the living hell out of me. The score, done by Jerry Goldsmith is now one of the most famous horror movie scores. It sets the mood and sends a chill up your spine. The acting is outstanding (especially Billie Whitelaw as Mrs. Baylock). Gregory Peck and Lee Remick are, as usual, fantastic. Billie Whitelaw is pretty much flawless as the evil nanny and Harvey Stephens, although he doesn't say much, is very good as little Damien.The last thing that makes the movie scary are some of the most bizarre deaths. The most known of them is a decapitation which is one of the scariest deaths in horror history.5/5.",The Omen

146,Al_The_Strange,"""Till man exists no more.""",9,24 October 2012,"Of all the films ever made, this is easily one of the most notorious. If for no other reason than all the freak accidents that occurred during the film's production; cast and crew members fell in danger, and a few passed away, from plane crashes and car accidents throughout the production period. It makes one wonder whether there was a curse of some kind surrounding the film.Regardless, it was a success in its day, and continues to resonate. It is most memorable for the freaky deaths it shows on screen (something of a progenitor to the Final Destination films; there are a few scenes in The Omen where some small or freakish thing causes another thing to maim, impale, or decapitate the hapless characters). In between these scenes, the film takes on a slow pace, and uses all its breathing room to let the story and narrative flow.Despite its pace, the film manages to maintain interest (and maintain tension) through its story. It does a phenomenal job at taking the core theological concept and weaving a tale out of it: a tale that feels plausible and realistic. In spite of that, it really instills the fear in the viewer; the on-screen deaths and the off-screen implications help build the tension and dread in the audience on a psychological level, and that makes it very effective as a horror story. It helps that the story and characters are thoughtfully developed.This film looks really classy, with decent photography and editing. Acting is great; Gregory Peck is impeccable, and everybody fulfills their roles well. Writing is strong. This production has adequate and real-looking sets, props, costumes, and locales. Music is epic! 4.5/5 (Entertainment: Pretty Good | Story: Perfect | Film: Very Good)",The Omen
147,nitzanhavoc,"Must have been excellent in the late 70's, but in today's standards - lacking, to say the least.",5,2 December 2012,"As a devout Horror fan who fancies himself a Horror freak, I've wanted to familiarize myself with some of the genre's classics. The process included watching the full series of Nightmare on Elm Street, Friday the 13th and Children of the Corn, and it was only a matter of time before my ""travels"" took me to The Omen.While watching the film (as well as writing this review) I've made sure to bear in mind that this was a film from the late 70's, when several aspects of the Cinema field have not yet developed, or at least not yet fully matured. For instance, what I've found to be most blunt, has been the acting. Throughout the film I haven't been able to not notice that the actors appear to be acting for the sake of acting, rather than to try and appear realistic and assist suspense of disbelief (very much like actors in musicals and plays in the theatre, who act like actors in a play or musical rather than like ""real"" characters). Furthermore, the ""struggle"" scenes (weather with other characters or beasts) all appear very unrealistic. And lastly, little Harvey Stephens, while adorable and precious, simply failed to frighten me in any way...Much of that criticism is probably due to the time the film was screened, when the a woman hanging herself, a man having his head chopped of and the very thought of children being possessed by the devil were enough to startle, unnerve and even shock an audience. Add to that the fact that I happen to be Jewish and not Christian, and you might understand why The Omen didn't really leave such an impression on me.However, having said that, if I do take consideration of the time the film was screened, I can very well understand how groundbreaking and innovative it must have been, and how many spectators have probably been really frightened by it. The story and script were good, the poor lighting and visual effects were probably (yet again) fine for the 70's, and the ending probably had people on the edges of their seats.All in all, I'm afraid I've been born too late and am too young to be able to fully appreciate The Omen, one of the masterpieces of the genre. I consider it my personal loss. However, I've had a great time watching it, and I recommend it to anyone who's a Horror fan and/or a fan of late 70's cinema.",The Omen
148,SkullScreamerReturns,"I can't stand ""evil children""",4,21 November 2020,"I had a vague memory of Omen being annoying when I saw it some 20 years ago. Watching it again wasn't quite as bad as I remembered but it clearly isn't my favorite kind of horror film. Most of all, I just don't like movies where the villain is a child. That's unfair...hiding behind cutesy innocence and being secretly devilish. You just wish someone would punch the devil in the face but that won't happen because you can't go punching kids.Technically it is a decent film in a similar style as Rosemary's Baby for example. The acting and directing are ok. It's just... there's not much anything cool in it. I like horror with monsters and something fantasy-like. This movie is a little bit more rooted in a realistic style, at least the visual side of it. So if you want a ""thriller"" with just a little bit of supernatural in it, then this might be your cup of tea. I just don't like it that much.I don't mind child actors in comedy for example but please, don't put them in horror movies, thank you.",The Omen

The story kept me interested up until the very end and Gregory Peck gives his usual terrific performance.  Without relying on lavish special effects or a giant budget, The Omen still manages to be one of the scariest and intense horror films of its era.  Personally I enjoyed this film more than I did The Exorcist, but that's just me.  Still, I would recommend The Omen to anyone that enjoys a truly scary and thought provoking horror film.  I personally found it to be much better than I originally expected.  Also for a laugh, be sure to look out for David Warner's awful 70's hairstyle.  8/10.",The Omen

This was 1976, remember, so what you'll get - and I'd say as an added bonus - is the very Seventies look and feel that movies had during this very unique era.When Peck exhumes the grave, and when the film closes with young Damien smiling, the hair on one's back shoots through the roof.

However, this was a movie that for some reason didn't thrill me all that much. Don't get me wrong, it definitely wasn't a bad movie. I just felt it was hard to follow the storyline. The storyline was great however. All the actors were good as well. The only one I wasn't too fond of was Ms. Baylock. But thats just my opinion. There were some very unique kills as well. Ones you won't find in any old basic slasher movie. Also, Robert THorn and Keith Jennings were 2 very convincing characters. Father Brennan was also genuinely creepy and a little shady, but it all worked well with the actors who played the parts. I give this a 6(66)/10.

Rather than devastate her with the news, Robert agrees to take in another baby born on the same night, in the same hospital, and whose mother died giving him birth. No one but Robert and the hospital priest will ever know that the baby isn't theirs. Six years later, terrible events begin to occur and all of them seem to be centered around the Thorn's son, Damien. A nanny hangs herself at a birthday party, a grim priest tells Robert that he knows who the boy's mother really is, and a news reporter named Jennings is finding alarming omens in the photographs he takes, omens which foretell a violent death for anyone who gets too close to the truth. When Katherine suffers a suspicious miscarriage, Thorn and Jennings head for Rome to find out if it's true: is Damien the Anti-Christ, son of Satan? And if he is, will Robert be able to destroy him?This movie followed in the wake of The Exorcist, and was immensely popular. Movies about apocalyptic disasters and demonic children were hot box office commodities in the 70s, and The Omen had both topics covered. However, The Omen was also an intelligently scripted, beautifully filmed and very suspenseful thriller to boot. It wasn't just a rip off of The Exorcist; it had its own story to tell, one taken from the Book Of Revelation, the most grim and frightening book in the Bible.The characters played by Gregory Peck and Lee Remick may be the ""beautiful people"" - rich, powerful and privileged - but they are still real people, and quite accessible. Kathy is a strong but emotionally fragile woman who seeks help from a psychiatrist. Robert will do anything to protect her from heartbreak and pain. It is their devotion to each other that makes this film so tense as we watch their lives unravel. Robert thought that by taking Damien in, he would simultaneously save his wife from grief and give an orphan a home, but the road to Hell is paved with good intentions, and in this case, that road is very real. David Warner as Jennings and Patrick Troughton as the cursed Father Brennan also win our sympathy as the ill-fated men who try their best to help Robert. Billie Whitelaw as Mrs. Blaylock is evil personified. We like her even though she's Satan's minion - it's her wicked, secretive smile and the fact that she'll do anything to protect Damien. Even Damien himself has our sympathy, even though little kids in tiny little suits are just really upsettingly scary. It's not Damien's fault that he is what he is - he didn't ask for this dubious honor, after all - and when he begs Robert not to kill him at film's end, it's hard not to feel sorry for both of them. This is a great film, filled with vicious Rottweilers, nasty deaths, powerful music and great performances by the entire cast. Should not be missed by film buffs in general and horror fans in particular.",The Omen
153,avik-basu1889,Biblical Horror !!!!!,6,6 December 2014,"I generally like horror films which deal with psychological issues and other themes which relate to the general lives of people. Hence I am a huge admirer of The Shining, The Exorcist, Rosemary's Baby, Repulsion, The Babadook,etc. The Omen starts with the premise of Robert(Gregory Peck) completely heartbroken after hearing that his baby has died just after birth at the hospital. He thinks he can't inform his wife Kathy(Lee Remick) about this death. The head priest of the catholic hospital reveals that another baby was born at that very day whose mother died during birth. So Peck decides to introduce this stranger to his wife as their son without telling her the truth. Slowly it gets revealed that this baby who grows into the boy named Daniel may be the Antichrist.The problem I have with this movie is the fact that it is too preoccupied with religious symbolism and biblical consequences. The problem is that there is no theme to this movie except the biblical one. A similar movie could have been made with implicit themes about how the father could never accept the kid completely and all that is happening could be pigments of his prejudiced imagination like ""We Need to Talk About Kevin"". But that is not the case here. What you see is what you get in The Omen. It is still a reasonably engaging watch and I can understand how some scenes could have been scary to viewers in the 70s, but now they look like clichés. The acting by Gregory Peck and Lee Remick is good. But Billie Whitelaw as Mrs. Baylock is the most memorable and extremely scary.The film is competently directed. The soundtrack is fascinatingly disturbing and creepy.I would have liked it more had I not watched it in 2014 after being familiar with all the clichéd tropes. The lack of any relatable theme also didn't help. But The Omen is still a relatively entertaining film worth watching once.",The Omen

Plus, the remake doesn't bring any new cool stuff to the table, and while that was enough in the 70's, it's not any longer.When I see these old movies, I always partly try to imagine how it must have been to see them for the first time when they actually came out. The Omen was probably scary as all hell, back then. And while it definitely has some cool stuff in it, scared I was not. I'm sure it was also quite controversial, considering the subject matter and the young child playing Damien.I am always somewhat skeptical when I sit down to watch old ""classics"", because frankly, they tend to be a little boring. The Omen did entertain me, though. (I am on a quest to see all horror movies, so just wanting to have seen it, also comes into play)Anyway! The Omen is well made, has some effective scenes, a little bit of a creepy atmosphere (at least at times), the acting is good, and the story is pretty good.

When his adopted son turns five, strange things begin to happen, and people connected to Damien begin to die. Soon, the politician teams up with a photographer to uncover the truth and put an end to the satanic killing. The Omen is a very creepy film that still chills me every time I watch it because of its creepy plot and chilling score.From the very beginning of the film you get chills, because in the opening credits you are treated to a Satanic score that sets the total tone for the film. Then you see the date at the bottom of the screen during the opening scene, June 6th, 6 am. That let's you know right away what the movie is going to be all about. Through the first half of the film, it is a regular creepy horror film with freaky and cool deaths. The second half of the movie is like a mystery, and the scenes where the photographer and Thorne are putting together that Damien is indeed the son of the Devil still gives me goosebumps. And not only does this movie contain the coolest beheading of all time, but the very first in Hollywood as well. Right up until the last creepy second of the film, you'll be on the edge of your seat.As for acting, I enjoyed all of the performances except for Gregory Peck, who is very wooden in some scenes, but I have to look past that because of how great the rest of the movie is.

At first everything seems to be going well, Damien(Harvey Stephens), is bonding well with mom and dad. The movie takes us from when Damien was really little, to his 6th birthday. On his birthday the Thorn's throw a huge party, with a Photographer, Jennings( David Warner), animals, friends, and rides. Everything is going great until the nanny who suddenly hangs herself. When this happens her final words were "" It's All For U, Damien"". The Thorn's are baffled by the event, but before it happened Jennings took a picture of her. He show's it to Robert, and it is a picture of what's to come( a noose around her neck). The picture gets sharper, when the event is about to happen. A new nanny shows up, Mrs. Baylock( Billie Whitelaw). She is not who she appears to be, she is a demon in disguise, so to speak. She is very protective, and from the start she a Kathrine clash, i.e. when the Thorns take him to church. When strange behavior starts to show in Damien, Katherine and Robert are bewildered.One day a priest, Father Brennan(Patrick Troughton), arrives at Robert's office. Father Brennan warns Robert about Damien and how he is the son of the devil. Robert thinks he is crazy, and has the priest thrown out of the office. One day Jennings, is there taking pictures of Robert and gets the priest also. This time the photo is of Father Brennan, with what appears to be a stake going through him. It's another odd coincidence that can be explained. The priest had cancer, but it still doesn't explain how he was impaled, after he had a longer, more private chat with Robert. When Jennings arrives and talks to Robert, he shows him his various photos, and how the images would get sharper as the events got near. Including Jennings own photo of himself, and explains all this to Robert. Robert now believe there's more to the story about his son, and he must find the truth about Damien. He along with Jennings go back to the hospital where the adoption took place, they find out the hospital had a fire and most of the records were destroyed. He talks to a nun, and asks if there were any survivors. She agrees the Priest who was responsible for the adoption survived. He is living out his remaining years in a monastery. Through the help of Jennings they find the priest and a cemetery close by. There Robert finds out more about what truly happened to his biological son, Damien's real mother, and what he must do. He locates an Exorcist, who tells him about Damien, what he needs to look for, and for the events to end what he must do. This movie is so much better than The Exorcist, a lot of drama and the score will send chills up and down your spine.

161,jayjaycee,Increasingly more terrifying take on the antichrist subject matter,7,18 October 2020,"""The Omen"" is a 1976 horror film directed by Richard Donner starring Gregory Peck and Lee Remick.
⚪
All in all, this Richard Donner classic diabolically constructs a complex and clever story about the possible existence of the antichrist, and despite some major pacing issues and lengths in the beginning, it becomes an intelligent, detailed and increasingly more threatening take on the well-known subject matter, and not only due to the charismatic performance by Gregory Peck, an intriguing and subliminally terrifying, chillingly crafted classic.
⚪
For the seventeenth day of Spooktober I have picked another classic from the seventies that has had my interest for quite a long time. As far as I can judge it, many films from around the end of the sixties to the mid-seventies dealt with cursed children and/or the existence of the antichrist. From Polanski's subtly terrifying milestone ""Rosemary's Baby"" to William Friedkin's adaptation of William Peter Blatty's controversial novel ""The Exorcist"", creepy and satanic infants have clearly been a thing back in the day. A later production sparked by this trend is this Richard Donner film. From many sources I have heard that this is generally seen as the direct contender to Friedkin's opus, and some even considered this one here to be scarier than it. Even if I haven't seen it yet (it is scheduled for next weekend), I can already tell you that I think that this is not the case at all. I mean, I have only looked at images of the seventy-three flick and they freaked me out more than this entire film did. Nevertheless, I think that Donner did a fantastic job with this film. In his feature film debut, if I got it correctly, he deals with the question whether the antichrist exists or is only a figment of everyone involved, and while the alleged son of Satan was still in the womb in the Mia Farrow lead film from sixty-eight, he is a young boy in this one, a boy that looks so innocent yet so mysterious at the same time. Six-year-old Harvey Stephens has since then become part of horror history, for a good reason, but I think the most pleasant aspect about this film is Gregory Peck as the disturbed father. The ""To Kill A Mockingbird"" superstar, generally known for playing dramas, made his horror film debut with this film, and as odd as it sounds to have Atticus Finch investigate whether his son is the offspring of the devil himself or not, he does a surprisingly terrific job, but as great as the central performance might be, the film suffers from some flaws, nevertheless. What irritated me the most is the overall pace of this film, because as phenomenal as it is in the end, the first half an hour was painfully lengthy and didn't manage to create the tension that eventually sent shivers down my spine. Seriously, aside from the first untimely death, not much is happening, and there wasn't even a decent atmosphere that would warm me up to it. For a time, I even thought that this film would turn out disastrous, but seemingly out of nowhere, the movie gained a lot of momentum I never thought it would gain. After this, the suspension curve consistently rises and makes use of its genuinely chilling features. Marks on photographs that scarily predict the demise of the ones depicted are not even what I consider to be the scariest aspect of the whole film, no, what gave me the chills was that the film's entire nature that, like ""Rosemary's Baby"", was completely ambiguous and didn't confirm in the very beginning whether it is all indeed the deed of evil forces or just the imagination and hysteria of everyone involved. Nothing in fact supernatural is happening in this film, everything happens within reason. The most frightening aspect about this feature film is the extreme uncertainty and the inability of what to believe. Is this innocent looking boy really Satan's own child? Well, his subliminally threatening nanny and his very own, intimidating guard dog (seriously, I am a cynophilist, but this animal was downright terrifying) contribute to this theory a lot. Furthermore, it is notable that the film palpably did its homework, because the love for detail, the examination of religious theories and the deciphering of Christian symbolism are intelligently elaborated, so much that I was thoroughly impressed throughout. In the end, it comes full circle and after all the tragic incidents that were indirectly predicted throughout, I was indeed astonished but not quite surprised that the film has a bad ending. That little rascal in fact manages to survive and eventually fulfil the prophecy (well, sequels equal money). The way he smiles directly into the camera is only the peak of New Hollywood influence of this film, and even if it started out extremely boring, it ended up being a intriguing, packing and subtly horrifying genre flick that is quite something else.",The Omen

The mother, played by Lee Remick feels disconnected from Damien as if he weren't her child. Which we know he isn't. Of course Robert knows the truth. A weird priest stalks him and tells him that his adopted son is the Antichrist. Over and over tragedy surrounds Damien. Robert is contacted by a photographer played by David Warner. He is puzzled by some marks on pictures that he took of the priest and the nanny that killed herself. Robert then goes to Italy to search for the truth about Damien. Slowly but surely he realizes the truth. Tgat Damien is the son of the Devil.This film was directed masterfully by Richard Donner in a very straightforward way. There is no wink or humor here. He takes the subject matter seriously. The cast is very good. Especially Gregory Peck. He gives depth to the character of a man who is struggling with what is painfully obvious about the mistake he made when he lost his real son. The film is very tense and even though we know who Damien is the process of Robert finding out gradually is done very well. The film is very scary at times, especially the Mrs. Blaylock character. She creeps me out. The one thing that takes this film to another level is the musical score by Jerry Goldsmith. Especially Ave Satani, the piece scares me to this day. If I listen to it even for a couple of seconds I get chills. It is a very suspenseful film, and I think only second to The Exorcist as a classic of this type of film. It also has on of the creepiest, most memorable final shots I have ever seen.Grade: A-",The Omen

Not being religious in anyway, but this film really got under my skin with its dark themes and Antichrist main character. What really is chilling is that Damian in this movie is a little kid. A little kid! He is being protected by those around him against people exposing his dark secret. Obviously this is not real, but the film sets a tone that little kids may not be as innocent as they seem. Excellent film. Dark and scary. Really atmospheric and haunting. Everything in this film is unpredictable which makes it scary as hell. Is that person going to die? Is that person bad? What's going to happen here??? The way all horror movies should be made.",The Omen
170,eshwarmail,More a good thriller movie than a horror one. Fun to watch nevertheless.,8,13 October 2012,"It should rather be called The Omens as there are plenty of them leading up to the birth and accession to power of anti-Christ. The atmosphere and setup comes in on the same lines as The Exorcist though it is just dealt from the opposite perspective. It is quite audacious for its time to have the main antagonist of the movie to be a 8 year old kid.Robert Thorn (Gregory Peck) is a diplomat assuming the role of an Ambassador to different countries on behalf of the U.S. government. When he was assigned in Italy, his wife Katherine (Lee Remick) delivers a stillborn, the head priest of the hospital offers a just born whose mother dies at child birth and keeps this truth from Katherine. After some strange events and his talk with a persistent priest about their child being an Antichrist, he tries to get to the bottom of this with the help of a photographer who seemed to have recorded some of these strange events.When I first saw a snippet of this movie on TV, I was thrilled; especially the scene where the nanny commits suicide during a birthday party. It felt raw and intriguing at the same time. Gregory Peck does an excellent job as a practical person unable to make sense to the accusations on his child, either by his wife or the priest. The writers include some thrilling moments like the attack by dogs at the cemetery to go along with the investigative mode the story takes upon. The background score is intense though a bit loud. Billie Whitelaw plays the role of a nanny who is like an apostle to help the Antichrist gives a stage like performance which could have been a lot better without her closeup weird looks. Screenplay and editing is neat but the end felt a bit too hasty to wrap things up. The kid though actually doesn't do any acting has the perfect look of both sweet and mischief.More a good thriller movie than a horror one. Fun to watch nevertheless.",The Omen
171,Jacques98,Below average.,1,27 January 2009,"I hear middle-aged men spout their outdated, biased wisdom all the time. ""Modern horror movies are just gory, not scary. The old movies, boy, now those were scary because you didn't always see the monster. If you want scary go watch . . ."" And they always finish their statement with whichever popular 70s horror film they first watched in their pre-teens and peed their pants over. To them, there could never be anything scarier because that movie is so ground into their psyche. To the modern viewer, there could never be anything funnier because we've matured and realized the real world is infinitely more terrifying than creaky staircases. I view old horror movies in the same way I view cartoons. They're so over-the-top and ridicules that it's impossible to take them seriously, but they have some entertainment value when you have nothing better to do. There are a handful of exceptions to that last sentenceAlien ('79), The Shining ('80), Black Christmas ('74)but for the most part, it's a fairly realistic view. While I hoped The Open could have been one of the few exceptions, it isn't. Doesn't even come close.I have a lot of appreciation for the slow opening that builds emotional impact and atmosphere. However, it seems that I can count the films that actually pulled off that style without just adding pointless scenes for the sake of pointless scenes on one hand. In The Omen, the slow build not only adds a lot of pointless scenesrunning animals, OH MY!but it makes the viewer fail to see the difference between this and a Lifetime move. The slow build never once emphasizes the imminent doom hanging over the family's heads; it just pumps the movie full of boredom and cheese. Unless you're frightened by running animals and a kid riding his tricycle, there is nothing subtly frightening here. And the slow build takes up 3/4ths of the entire movie. I'll give The Omen credit for having one well-done abrupt moment of shock near the beginning, but after that it goes back to cliché drama. Horror directors/writers have a false idea that if they immerse you in the daily life of the characters, you'll care about them when they're killed or are nearly killed. The reason that is untrue is because all the characters in The Omen are all flat clichés. Who would have guessed the husband doesn't believe in the supernatural, then by the end is converted into believing the absurd storyline? Who would have guessed the wife is a spineless women who just whines and acts dumb in every scene she has? Drama doesn't build an attachment to characters. It didn't in 1970, it doesn't today. What builds an emotional attachment to characters is characters that actually have CHARACTER. Characters that actually have a personality and aren't just walking horror clichés with legs.The other problem with The Omen is the absurdity of it all. A man's adopted son is really the antichristthat I can take seriously. Everyone associated with the antichrist is marked with sacrilegious symbols and must be contended with in religious waysthat's just stupid. Being someone with a theological background, the stupidity of religious horror movies always makes me laugh. Instead of actually following scripture and creating a genuinely terrifying experience, there always has to be retarded gobbledygook thrown in to cheese everything up. Instead of accurately portraying a realistic Christian or non-Christian, every last person in these religious horror films have to be a religious extremist of a die-hard atheist. There is just no realism. People site The Omen as one of the movies that subtly frightens you to the point of terror, but that simply isn't true. The Omen bashes you over the head with cheesy, over-the-top Hollywood conventions. I find it ironic: modern horror films bash you with gore and it's not scary; older horror films bash you with cheese and it's REALLY not scary. When I wasn't bored, I was laughing.The Omen isn't a perfectly terrible movie, though. The directing is solid. The slow-mo close-ups of predictable plot points, however, got really stupid really fast. The acting from everyone but the wife is very solid. The wife is possibly the most over-the-top whiney female in any 70s horror film, period. The entire movie carries a very classic feel that most 70s horror movies carry, and that adds some entertainment value. The actual story, if they were to have taken out the gobbledygook, is fairly solid and interesting, even if it isn't anything new or original. And that's all the good I can say.As I said, I appreciate a lot of what made parts of The Omen a solid movie and gained it its classic status. That doesn't mean I can take it seriously, because I can't. It's too ridiculous and pumped with too much cheese. When I think of true terror, I most often think of something realistic. People say ""torture porn"" and gore isn't scary, but it hits far more raw nerves with me and other horror fans because it's something that could really happen. It's not campy or fun. It's real. It's disturbing. Isn't that what true horror is supposed to be? That doesn't mean I hate old horror movies. Straw Dogs ('71) was the forerunner for Saw ('04). Just because something's old doesn't mean it's good, and just because something's new doesn't mean it's bad. And vice versa. But it's impossible for me to give a high score to The Omen. A lot of my older horror movie reviews spark responses that absentmindedly claim: ""You're not a true horror fan because you didn't like this. Go review comedies."" To which I respond: I thought I was.1/10",The Omen

The scene that I remember the most was the photographer that had his head cut off from an oncoming truck. I look at that scene now and realize how fake it looks. The other part I remember was the lady that hung herself from the window of the house. this whole movie is creepy, one of my favorites of the demon possession era. And Damian seems like just a normal little child under the influence of adults that come into his life trying to ""protect"" him. I don't think that he was ever really aware of who or what he really was. This movie grips you into it's world and makes you think about the characters involved and helps you to follow into the story.

179,Christopher_Reid,A decent horror movie but dated and silly,6,23 January 2016,"The Omen starts out boring and slow and has a lot of intrusive, off- putting music. I like the dark choral chant parts but a lot of the rest sounds loud and distracting. It's actually really annoying. Jerry Goldsmith may be a respected and prolific composer but he's never been one of my favourites and I think there are flawed music choices in this movie and much of it is forgettable. It fails to add to the tension but instead makes the viewing experience unpleasant. Dissonance can sometimes just cause headaches rather than suspense.The Omen looks very dated to me. The fashion, cars and directing style all scream 70s in a way that good films from the era do not. Spielberg and Coppola had their own style. The Omen has few cinematic touches that impress me. The child's acting is also quite mediocre. You can almost hear the director yelling things off-screen to get him to react the right way.That was my main problem with this movie. It was hard to get in to. It feels amateurish and slow. I didn't really like Lee Remick's acting although she does transition from happy to fearful and concerned. Gregory Peck is okay but has a strange way of talking that drags things out unnecessarily. His love for his wife and child seems stilted and forced. Maybe that's what upper-class families are like. Their romance feels rushed and fake. Peck must be quite a bit older as well.The movie does get more interesting and the story plays out quite well. As a horror, it's fairly satisfying - you're intrigued by a mystery which the film treats seriously. If you go along for the ride, it's a little scary and fun. You can see the influence this movie has had on many later horror movies. However, most of those movies are terrible and this one has similar flaws. There are strange precursory marks which turn up in photographs, a pattern of strange deaths, references to (made-up) bible passages and the number pattern 666 comes up a few times.None of it holds up though to scrutiny though. Perhaps you have to believe in the Devil or God. What happens is so arbitrary and it's not clear where powers and forces begin and end. Even Dracula has a more consistent set of rules and logic. If you have a brain which you regularly use, you'll see right through the stupidity of these details.In particular, many death scenes are reminiscent of those in the Final Destination series of films. Maybe you're cooking, slip on a puddle of split milk and accidentally fall on your knife and die. And as the audience sees the danger, scary music plays. This stuff doesn't work on me. It's ridiculous and just completely silly. It's disturbing that some people seem to believe in this kind of karma, as if your number's up and an accident is destined to take your life. I'm afraid every effect must have a cause and the spooky ""inevitability of fate itself"" doesn't count.Some frustrating points now.Why does the priest babble like an insane person? Why can't people calmly communicate and work together in horror films? Hear each-other out and focus on the solid evidence and explore their options? Why can't they test their theories instead of blindly opting one way or the other? Why not show Damien a cross and see how he reacts? Get a priest to talk with him. Read the bible to him. Then you might get somewhere, you'd know either way.Why let a creepy nanny into your house? She doesn't follow instructions, so why would you keep her? Why not look behind you if you hear your son riding his tricycle where he shouldn't be? Why speed, drawing the attention of the police unnecessarily?In summary, The Omen was disappointing. It's an okay horror film compared to the huge mass of awful ones that exist. But it's deeply stupid with countless frustrating plot deficiencies. And it looks and feels old. But it's made reasonably well, takes its subject matter seriously and has a story that does become engaging. Perhaps it's best asset is its psychological boldness. It's pretty dark and it's a tough experience for the main characters. In that way, it is scary and memorable.",The Omen
180,freaky_dave,Very atmospheric with a great chilling score makes the Original Omen a must for horror fans,8,15 November 2007,"This is one spooky movie. It is filled with great atmosphere and dread. The musical score is one of the best with chants included that just add to the oncoming horror. The Omen is not a gory film, even though there are a few shocking scenes, but more of a mood piece that lets the horror build from the beginning, until escalating into one of the most chilling endings ever.Robert Thorne (Gregory Peck) has just discovered that his child has died at birth. A priest at the hospital talks him into accepting another baby who was born at the same time whose mother died at childbirth. He never tells his wife Katherine (Lee Remick) of the switch, and together they raise the child as their own.Strange ominous things start happening, and on Damien's fifth birthday they come to the front with the death of Damien's nanny in one of the most shocking scenes in horror movie history. Things start escalating as more strange deaths occur to those people who are a threat to the boy. A priest named Father Brennan (Patrick Troughton) warns Thorne of the danger. Thorne's response is to ignore him at first, but as things become weirder, he finally decides to listen to what the priest has to say.On top of all this, a sinister nanny named Mrs. Baylock (Billie Whitelaw in a terrific performance) replaces the old nanny, and you know almost right away that there's something not right with this woman. At around the same time, a photographer named Keith Jennings (David Wariner) notices that his pictures are showing ominous shadows of what appear to be a foreshadowing of certain character's deaths. He approaches Thorne with this news, and together they try to get to the bottom of the mystery of Damien. I need not say anymore.This was Richard Donner's directorial debut, and it shows, even at an early stage in his career, that he was going to be a great one. The mood, atmosphere, the haunting score which won an academy award, were all great. The pacing is phenomenal, and his use of using wind to punctuate the score in many scenes only makes the movie that much more sinister and creepy.The acting for the most part was rather good, though Peck and Remick show no real chemistry as a married couple. Harvey Stephens as the young Damien was the perfect choice for this movie, with his haunting eyes and sinister smiles. David Wariner as the photographer and Patrick Troughton as Father Brennan were both good choices as well.The Omen is not the perfect movie. The scenes with Peck and Remick seemed forced as if the two really didn't like each other and were just playing a part, and I kinda didn't like how the movie made the devil seem more powerful than God, but I guess with being a horror movie, you have to take what you can.There are a few gruesome scenes for gore hounds (including a shocking decapitation), but nothing that can compare to today's horror films. This movie relies more on mood and atmosphere, unlike those many gore movies I just talked about which offer no real suspense whatsoever. The Omen is one of the best known movies dealing with the devil. It is also considered a classic by many. I wouldn't quite put it in the classic stage, but it is ten times better than most of the drivel we get today.",The Omen
181,saytosandeep,MY REVIEW: The Omen of Horrors!!,8,9 February 2014,"And I thought Rosemary's Baby (my personal favourite) is the most scary movie on the God's rival Satan's child entry into the world of ours. I was proved wrong when I saw The Omen. The Omen takes the idea of Rosemary's Baby forward and tells you the story of a family who finds that their son can be the son of Satan. The atmosphere is enhanced by haunting back ground score, water tight screenplay, sincere acting, taught direction and a lot of scary moments making this horror experience a masterpiece. There are many scenes that stand out like a group of Baboons attacking the car carrying Satan's son, father and the photographer finding the dead mother of Satan's son, father reciting a verse from bible after finding the news of death of his beloved, the killing of photographer and many more. It might be hard to go and re- watch the movie because of its genuine scare moments but it stands at very top in my list of best horrors because as they say ""horror lies in knowing something bad is about to happen"".

183,arthurclay,Even Better than The Exorcist,10,26 June 2005,"This is one of those few horror movies that you can watch repeatedly even if you are not a horror junkie. Gregory Peck was not known for doing horror films and I think that is why he was so good for the part. Too bad for Charlton Heston he didn't grab this role when it was offered to him he certainly missed the train on this one. Robert Thorn (Peck) is a U.S. Ambassador whose wife (Remick) loses her child at birth in Rome and at the suggestion of a local priest switches his dead child with a live one without his wife's knowledge. He moves his family to London and five years later his counterfeit son Damien is thrown a birthday party and all Hell brakes loose. It sets off a countdown to ultimate destruction as Thorn starts to suspect his small child Damien is evil incarnate and unveils an unholy conspiracy which may bury them all. Lee Remick is simply gorgeous and was one of the prettiest women in Hollywood. And that kid Harvey Stephens is stupendously great. I saw a trivia clip on AMC DVD/TV that said in real life he was very badly behaved while shooting the film which means he was a really good pick for Damien. This film conveys horror by inference, suggestion, and impending doom instead of cheap special effects and pea soup. It is much more scary to sense and anticipate evil rather than to just see it. As Hitchcock said nothing can create more terror than the human mind and this principle is put to full effect in The Omen. This may have been the first movie where a little kid is the antagonist and the audience is rooting against him like mad. This movie was part of the cinematic revolution where the forces of darkness are shown to have much more force and sway than their counterpart (along with The Exorcist, Rosemary's Baby, and The Shining) and features one Devil of a surprise ending. The Omen is the cornerstone of the horror genre and was followed by three sequels. The first is always the best.",The Omen

They clearly can't trust this woman who on top of that seems unstable and dangerous and yet they keep her around as a nanny. Why does'nt Thorn kill Damian at the house? Why take him to a church to kill him? Who or what was the woman that gave birth to Damian? This is never explained. Why does'nt Thorn ask to see his son who he is told was still born?

186,imbluzclooby,More tragic than scary,7,28 May 2015,"I remember when The Omen premiered back in 1976. It made a pretty big splash due to intrigue with the Horror genre involving the diabolic. Television trailers featured the action parts such as the Safari drive with hissing baboons. The movie mavens did a good job marketing this as a horror vehicle and there is no doubt this movie made a big profit.The Omen opens on a very strange and tragic tone. The rest of the film is pretty grim throughout, and up until the climax. There aren't any scenes or nuances of comic relief. It is just a somber exercise in fear and dread deeply seating itself in the morass of Biblical prophecy and symbolism.Our protagonist, Robert Thorn, a wealthy American magnate of some vague political stature, drives frantically through the streets of Rome as we hear the Voice-over of the priest, Fr.Spiletto, sadly informing him of his stillborn child. Expressing to the priest his wife's desire to have her own child, he agrees to adopt a child born at the same time whose mother died while giving birth to him. The exchange is made and Mr. Thorn's somber expression cannot be hidden. He basically deceives his wife who unknowingly has a strange child. This child as we all know is the Son of Satan. Images of happy family outings and picture collages flash on the screen, but we cannot share their joy knowing that this kid is destined for bad news. The heart of the story doesn't develop until the Devil Boy, Damien, reaches the age of five. Then everything starts to change from his temperament, his personality, their luck and the new staff of assistants. And it's not for the better. We all know what's going down as this story unravels. Disturbing scenes of people who are privy to the impending Evil get killed off. So we want to see what happens. But Good doesn't prevail in this movie like it did in The Exorcist or The Shining. This is a grim and depressing film. It is effective in making us queasy and upsetting us, but it is certainly not without its flaws.I like the atmospheric quality of the movie and there are some stunning camera angles. Effective usage of dim lighting and Old-mansion sets are used very well. The background score is my least favorite aspect of the film. The chanting and symphonic music feels too corny and grandiose. Not very good choice for unnerving music, although it won an Academy Award for best Musical Score. My biggest peeve about The Omen is a peeve I have with most Horror movies; the characters are too thickheaded and dense to understand what's going on. Gregory Peck, a great guy and actor, looks so out of place with his stagy presence and stentorian voice. Being the most clueless of all the characters in the movie, one wonders why a man of his station can be so stupid. And he is. It takes him too long to realize his son is not just weird, but a malevolent being. Lee Remick is pretty wooden as an actress until she gets afraid and dawns that frozen petrified look of terror with her Icy gaze and panic stricken countenance. The boy is too young to really show any acting chops so the director cops out by having him flash creepy grins over his pale skin and eyebrow-less face. The crazy priest seems too over the top initially, but when we learn he is a troubled soul with mental issues, the actor is justified in his approach. ""My character is crazy so I can act as crazy as I want"" theory.The Omen keeps us in suspense while there are a few scenes that lag, they are used appropriately to further the plot.So many questions bother me about this film and films like it. Why does the Devil want to kill off family members? Does the little boy know he is Evil? Is the Devil an actual being that can take on many forms, or is The Devil the evil in mankind? What is the significance of the Jackal? And why a Jackal and not a pig, a moose or a leopard? Do we take it literally that a human fetus can gestate in the body of another species? Is this a supernatural element similar to The Virgin Birth of Christ? Why did Kathy's last pregnancy trouble her to want an abortion? Why did the crazy priest implore Mr. Thorn to have the baby killed? It was the 5 year old Damien who was the bad seed, not the unborn fetus.These are the questions that go unanswered.",The Omen
187,tequila101,Damien!!!!,9,21 November 2011,"The Omen 1976 is a classic example of scaring the jimmies off of someone, making their bones jump right out of their skin! This film creep-ed the hell out of me when I first watched it, I mean who isn't afraid of someone who they think is just innocent. Who thinks that a little boy is bound to be the one causing the deaths of innocent people? Well it's little five year old Damien Thorn! I won't go too much into this since everyone has had to see this. The film starts off with an ambassador's wife getting pregnant but she loses the child and is replaced with a new child. This new child starts showing different signs and later on (after been persuaded heaps), the ambassador, Robert Thorn believes his son is the anti-Christ.Really excellent story which really kicks ""The Exorcist"" right out the window. This story keeps you wondering what's happening, pandering on how it's all going to ravel up and what mysterious lie within that cute, innocent cherub Damien.I'm not giving any scenes or nothing away, nothing, GO and watch it if you haven't seen it.All I will say is that it's suspenseful, it keeps you on the edge like other old horror classics have and the score by Jerry GoldSmith is created beautifully in this film. First he builds up with emotion and some happiness, and that he goes deep making is booming and loud as hell! I also think the direction of this film was taken really well.8.5/10",The Omen
188,counterrevolutionary,Good fright flick,8,9 January 2004,"The funny thing about a good movie is how it can overcome its own stupidity. With CASABLANCA, it's the ""letters of transit which can't be...questioned."" With THE OMEN, it's the whole ""666"" thing. The idea that the ""number of the beast"" consists of three Arabic numeral sixes is extremely silly. In fact, the number expressed in modern decimal notation as 666 can be just as reasonably represented as 1010011010 or DCLXVI, depending upon which numbering system one is using.Of course, THE OMEN, unlike the superior THE EXORCIST, uses (and occasionally abuses) Christianity merely for atmosphere. The plot itself has nothing to do with actual Christian theology or Biblical eschatology (whether you accept the Evangelical ""Left Behind"" interpretation or not). But that's OK. Although it lacks THE EXORCIST'S intellectual and philosophical seriousness, it's still a good atmospheric horror flick.",The Omen

It's one of the few Gregory Peck movies in which his slightly wooden personas work well with the script. And it is a very horrific movie to boot.Patrick Troughton is great as Father Brennan, the doomed priest who tries to convince Peck of the evil in Damien, and his death was one of the better deaths in the genre.  The revelations of Damien's true ""mother"" and Peck's real son are probably the most horrific moments in the film...there is a subtlety to the terror that just connects with you.David Warner is also outstanding as the photographer who tries to help Peck, and Leo McKern is great, as always, in the small role he has in the film.",The Omen
191,possumopossum,"After This Movie, How About A Choir Concert?",8,5 April 2007,"If this movie doesn't scare you, the music will. Is it just me, or was the music louder than the dialog in this movie? That was the biggest knock I had on this film. The dialog was so quiet, one had to strain to hear it. Then all of a sudden, we get blasted out of our seats with that choral music. The first time I heard this, it was as if someone had poured a bucket of ice water down my back.As for the movie itself, as I said, it's hard to keep track of what's going on because you can barely hear anything but Jerry Goldsmith's great, but just a little bit too loud music. I do like movies with a Biblical theme, and basing a movie on the Book of Revelations was a bold move. Not many people have the courage to even read that Book in the Bible, let alone make a movie of it. This was an admirable effort in that direction.Damien was just downright scary. (How many people since this movie came out has named their child Damien? I don't know of anybody.) That smile he has is as chilling as Jerry Goldsmith's music. That kid must have been one hell of an actor (pun definitely intended.) Many people like to compare this movie to THE EXORCIST. Please! THE EXORCIST, while having a good idea, went overboard in trying to get their point across and turned into a parody of itself. There is no comparison. This is a great thriller and even scarier than THE EXORCIST. And it tells the story better as well. 8 out of 10.",The Omen

Richard Donner's direction is very self-confident with hardly any flaws, and the film is visually quite appealing.As a pure shocker, it's a tremendously effective product--mostly thanks to Jerry Goldsmith's irreplaceable background score. Gregory Peck does well in the leading role, but the biggest impression is made by Billie Whitelaw as the nanny straight from hell.",The Omen
193,pacman-81,Now this how you make a horror!,8,23 March 2020,"The Omen made in 1976 has aged very well and I must say it still leads the way on how a horror movie should be made.

He is told at the exact same time a child was born and the mother died and offers the child to the grieving man insisting no one needs to know. As little Damien grows older, peculiar and supernatural events occur and his mother grows more suspicious of his behaviour. Is he the anti-Christ?
The story is fantastic with great direction, the creeps are perfect and the slight bit of gore is necessary and not just thrown in for the sake of it. The actors are first rate and this film makes you ask if they could get a horror right in 1976 why are there so many shite ones out now?

The acting is top-notch, the character development is an excellent blend of dramatic suspense and shock, while at the same time, offering very little blood or gore. The Omen is a movie that makes you think and maintains interest throughout.Credit must be given to many masters of acting in this movie. Gregory Peck and Lee Remick are wonderful as the parents of satanic child Damian, played to perfection by young Harvey Stevens. Billie Whitelaw is absolutely chilling as the sinister housekeeper who will stop at nothing to protect Damian.Cinematography is also very effective. This is because The Omen builds off of situational suspense and an excellent music score rather than going for a cheap bloody gross-out, which seems to be the main ingredient of most horror films today that are too long on effects but short on substance, The Omen has just the right amount of quality effects and suspense to make it a classic to remember for the ages.The only downfall (and it is mild) is that sometimes the actors talk very quietly and it isn't always easy to hear what they are saying.

198,stumpmee77,If one's fond of a film providing straight answers don't watch the original Omen.,8,18 January 2009,"The trailer's the tip of the iceberg start of the head trip I go through every time watch the Omen. I'm very certain others will undergo degree of rethinking, whether a first or not first time watching this movie.If Donner was attempting to deliberately mislead and/or confuse his audience he succeeded with me. It's a very complicated tale calling one to dig deeper in terms of events, motivations--Uhhh...who is calling the shots with the deaths? Either first introduced to a character or at some point later on, I found my perceptions going all over the place; he or she was crazy, evil--scheming--Everyone except Damien. If the adage ""look out for the quiet ones"", was placed in dictionary and I had control of how the meaning is defined I'd select the original Damien as one of movie history's finest examples. Way I see it real outwardly scary thing from Damien's way surface wise is his resemblance to both parents. ""Eyes around the color of Katherine's""; Hair shade, eyebrows like Robert's"" proceed on.The power of the original film and what the remake sorely lacks--this husband and wife love each other and adore their ""son"". Robert and Kathering are not a stupid couple; they are naive and loving as they're wealthy and other than the photographer, the researcher guy and the 1st nanny it's revealed they've been betrayed at nearly every turn. Donner appeared to me keeping the shift from happy to tragic for Damien's parents so vague, I'm not sure at what point their downfall begins. And his handling Damien is nothing sort of ground breaking. There's nothing this boy does that can't be pointed elsewhere or dismissed as he's just a kid.",The Omen
199,IamROCKAS,Good adaptation of a great book,7,8 August 2021,"I've recently finished reading David Seltzer's book, so it was only a matter of time before I watched its adaptation in film. My expectations were high as it came out in the same year one of my favorite horror movies - Carrie - was released. As with adaptations, I don't plan to compare the book and the movie as they are two completely different media, with one being a novel that's David Seltzer wrote and another being a movie that was directed by Richard Donner in a way that fit his vision the best. My favorite kinds of adaptations are the ones that work as fillers for the book while the book works as a filler for the movie. In other ones, they tell the same story with little and pieces that make the most sense after you went through the trouble of reading the book and watching the movie. Some notable books and their movie adaptations that fit these criteria are Youth Without Youth (Mircea Eliade's novella, published in 1976, and the fantasy drama film, produced and directed by Francis Ford Coppola in 2007) and Akira (Katsuhiro Otomo's Japanese cyberpunk manga, with 6 volumes being published between 1982 and 1990, and the Japanese animated post-apocalyptic cyberpunk action film, directed by the same person who wrote and illustrated the manga, Katsuhiro Otomo, in 1988, two years before the final chapter in the manga was released). Today, I'd like to include The Omen on that list.At the first glance, The Omen isn't much different from the other horror and thriller movies of that era. You've got the soundtrack with heavy use of classical music and high pitch violins during the more intense moments, you've got the male lead who's demeanor is inspired by Cary Grant in North by Northwest (1959) and Sean Connery in From Russia With Love (1963) and you've got a story that covers darker subjects, usually revolving around religion. Usually, these movies take some time to build the plot before the action starts but The Omen gives us our first victim fairly early. Even though the kill count is low here, each of the deaths (and the ways they were shot!) is more memorable than the last. As the plot progresses and the sinister details start to emerge one after another, the chills start comings just from the awareness of the situation. That leads us to an ending, that is both swift and alarming when you understand how everything shall progress further.No matter how much I liked the story, I feel like it might be a bit confusing to those, who haven't read the book. I felt like the plot was going too fast at some points and some scenes had an important meaning that didn't translate to film well. That includes the zoo scene and the whole section in Italy and Israel later in the film. Despite how rushed it felt, it still manages to almost hit the 120-minute runtime, which is surprising, considering how fast it went by. A lot of what happened wasn't even addressed later, as if that hadn't happened at all. It felt like the movie was the ""Then"" formula instead of the ""Therefore"". Thing A happened, then thing B happened, which was followed by thing C happening, when thing A should of lead to thing B happening and resulting in thing C occurring. The plot schemes didn't always connect but the whole image got far clearer when moving towards the second half of the movie. Well, having read the book also makes it easier but I just got the sense that the parts of the movie might seem weird to the audiences who haven't read the book.Overall, I liked the movie. The story is just that fascinating and knowing the details that didn't make it into the film resulted in a good viewing experience. There aren't that many books I've read that have a popular movie adaptation, let alone a good one. I love how they spend a bit more time discussing the rhyme and the meaning behind it. The interpretation of what the Holy Roman Empire and the eternal sea are in their timeline helped me look at the story from a slightly different angle, hence why I wanted to include this movie in the list of great adaptations. The cast was also great. The only thing that this movie lacked was a bit of structure but that could only be fixed by greatly increasing the run-time or splitting the movie into two, so I'm fine with the result as it is.If you haven't read the book, please tell me what you thought about the movie - did everything make sense plot-wise or did it leave you shaking your head from time to time? I'm sincerely curious how the plot affects people who haven't read the book.",The Omen
200,Snake-666,Brilliant horror!,9,14 September 2003,"The Omen' stars Gregory Peck as Robert Thorn, an ambassador to the United States, who substitutes his wife's stillborn baby for another without her knowledge. Although the baby, named Damien, appears to be a normal, healthy child he seems to be the centre of many strange and grisly occurrences including the death of a Priest who previously warned Robert about Damien. Robert tries to reason the situation but is finally convinced when confronted by photographer Jennings (David Warner) who has pictures with some shocking indications of the truth on them. Like the other great religious horror of the 1970's, The Exorcist', this movie incorporates a supposedly innocent child as a symbol of evil and succeeds almost faultlessly. A superb performance by Gregory Peck is the highlight of this movie which also features a solid storyline, a strong supporting cast (including Lee Remick) and exceptional direction from Richard Donner who makes this a shining example of how to create a slick and highly enjoyable horror/thriller. The story moves at exactly the right pace and although while watching the movie some may think it will continue forever, The Omen' remains entertaining and gripping throughout. What I really loved about The Omen' is how the story was based perfectly around actual Christian beliefs about the antichrist. Rather than make up the rules as it went along like so many other religious or demon based movies The Omen' stayed very close to the genuine prophecies that it seeks to portray which adds to the effect for those who have studied religion, at least that is what I would presume. The Omen' is much less graphic than The Exorcist' but is still shocking on many levels. The Omen' is more of a psychological horror than 'The Exorcist' (which itself succeeded in creating terror on a psychological level) which works by instructing the viewer that certain events will happen but leaving the viewer in a state of uncertainty as to whether they will happen. Although The Omen' has some rather grisly scenes the gore never distracts from the story and instead compliments the film beautifully. The Omen' is not afraid to break all the conventional horror movie rules about survival and timing so the shock-factor is increased for certain scenes while it becomes hard to tell how this film could possibly end? There we have another awe-inspiring part of the film  the end. Gripping and intense! The final ten minutes offer one of the most powerful performances in a horror movie as well as some outstanding scripting and direction which allowed the scenes to build up and leave the viewer with a chilling closing image. Often imitated but never rivalled The Omen' is one of the 1970's best movies which paved the way for the big-budget flicks of the 80's such as Poltergeist'. Phenomenally successful at the time it seems strange that this movie has not really achieved the cult status of many lesser-films and though retaining some popularity is often neglected when talking about the great movies of horror. For those people who enjoy well acted, shocking, slick and highly artistic movies or religious-horror I heartily recommend this movie. I certainly believe this is a must-see for horror fans. My rating for The Omen' - 8.5/10.",The Omen
201,MrVibrating,"Dated, yes, but still with a mood not seen in modern cinema.",9,24 December 2005,"The omen is a good movie, even today. Although I knew kind of what was going to happen(I've read the hilarious book ""Good Omens"") and the score of the film had been ripped off by a not-so-serious horror comedy, I still enjoyed the movie.There are many factors why. First of all, the child actor portraying Damien is excellent. He's much like a normal child, but with an edge. Some scenes are still shocking, even to a jaded viewer like me. The grown-ups do a good job as well, from Peck as the stiff, unbelieving ambassador to the worried mother who believes her child is evil.The plot is good, the death scenes are very imaginative, and Jerry Goldsmith's score is great. This is a great movie for a late night when you want to be just a little bit scared. Even if it has dated a bit, the mood in the movie is so far unrivaled by today's horror.8/10",The Omen
202,RomanJamesHoffman,Good morning. You are one day closer to the end of the world,6,19 August 2014,"so went the end-times paranoia marketing campaign for 'The Omen'. Evidently the campaign, initiated months before the film's release, was a success as Warner Brothers' tale of an impeding apocalypse wrought upon the earth by the birth of The Antichrist as foretold in the Book of Revelations was a huge commercial hit and can still raise a shiver even today.In the movie Gregory Peck plays Robert Thorn, an American ambassador who is approached by a mysterious priest who offers him a baby boy when his pregnant wife suffers a stillborn delivery. Thorn accepts the boy and the family are then transferred to England where things are fine until five years later when disturbing events begin to occur which suggest that the ambassador's ""son"", Damien, is a chip off a much more sinister block. The ambassador is then tracked down by an eccentric priest blabbering about the end-of-the-world and Damien's role as The Antichrist. Initially dismissive, Thorn gradually comes to believe the priest's eschatological spiel when more people die and he discovers a birthmark on Damien's head in the shape of 666, the number of the beast, and decides to do what he can to avert the coming apocalypse.Following on from the Big Budget clout of earlier demonic problem-child horror 'The Exorcist' (1973), 'The Omen' seemed to take the lifeblood of its success from the deeply buried fear that there may actually be something in all of those un-listened to Sunday-school sermons drowning in the public's unconscious. With this lingering religious fear in the background, and accentuated by the ominous and Oscar winning score by Jerry Goldsmith, the hysterical atmosphere created by the film is enough to suspend even the most atheistic viewer's disbelief and remains my abiding impression of the film beyond any of the particularities of the plot. However, in saying this there is an implied criticism which makes the film merely ""watchable"" to ""good"" and nowhere near ""great""; namely, while the film has atmosphere in spades and the kills are imaginative, the script hangs lifelessly off these good points and makes the film feel flabby and even dull at points.Perhaps, the reason for this is that whereas the two other films in the unholy trinity of demon-child horrors 'Rosemary's Baby' (1968) and 'The Exorcist' were both adapted from source novels, the genesis (pun intended) of 'The Omen' came from a realisation producer Harvey Bernhard had that the fundamentalist prophecies his born-again Christian friend would spout during conversations were in fact paranoid horror fantasies ideal for a movie. He then enlisted the help of screenwriter David Seltzer to flesh out the idea. However, in later years, Seltzer has been open about taking on the project solely due to needing money and maybe this absence of artistic commitment (so abundant in the other two films) is what explains the flabby through-line. As such, 'The Omen' lacks the Luciferian splendour of the 'Rosemary's Baby', and lacks the subtext of theological doubt that 'The Exorcist' author William Peter Blatty was wrestling with (although it shares the charge of Christian propaganda).So, while Damien would surely get a B- in his Satanic seminary, with his teacher despairing that he has potential but just isn't applying himself, it's still a pass grade higher than many others in the class.",The Omen
203,matheusmarchetti,Satanic Horror at it's purest form,10,1 July 2007,"A great addition to the Satan / Religious Horror frenzy of the 70's, The Omen sets around Robert Thorn (Gregory Peck) who adopts a little boy.

When the boy completes 6 years old, his nanny commits suicide by hanging herself from the roof of the Thorn's country manor, during Damien's birthday party.

205,Colbridge,Children being possessed by the Devil was a touchy subject for God fearing audiences back in the 1970's,7,12 August 2021,"Thanks to Richard Donner's assured direction, excellent performances by all cast members and Jerry Goldsmith's Oscar winning score this devil possession story gave The Exorcist a run for it's money in the 1970's and proved to be very popular and remains a pivotal film in the horror genre. However having revisited it recently it hasn't aged as well as The Exorcist.This time a young boy is the devil's child and born to do Satan's work and like The Exorcist it has a contemporary setting, making it feel more realistic to audiences on it's release which contributed to it's unsettling nature. By today's standards though it is quite tame but there is still a lot to admire and enjoy about The Omen.Firstly Jerry Goldsmith sets the Biblical tone with his epic score as Damien starts to wreak havoc to those around him. Gregory Peck and Lee Remick are superb as the parents trying to cope with their son being the child of Satan and the sufficiently creepy performances of Billie Whitelaw as the Nanny and Patrick Troughton as The Priest sends chills down the spine.It's a story well told and executed by Richard Donner despite the relatively low budget which proved to be his breakthrough movie as he went on to direct Superman, The Goonies and the Lethal Weapon franchise. There are a couple of nice set pieces aimed to shock the audience but it works more as a dark thriller than a horror. Modern audiences will be disappointed there are no jump scares to be told when to be scared, instead it seeps into your subconscious and chills rather than scares.The Omen takes itself quite seriously and David Seltzer's script based on the Book of Revelations admirably tries to make you believe Satan has arrived but it's Richard Donner's tight handle on proceedings that really makes it work, having stripped back Seltzer's script to remove the more fanciful gothic elements and keep it more believable in a modern setting.Having caused a bit of a stir on it's release when children being possessed by the Devil was a touchy subject for God fearing audiences back in the 1970's, audiences today will wonder what all the fuss was about.",The Omen
206,Holdjerhorses,"""First is usually best . . . """,6,14 May 2007,"I remember dinner at a restaurant with two friends, one a second-tier executive at 20th Century Fox, a few months before the premiere of ""The Omen."" ""'The Omen' is gonna make 'The Exorcist' look like a tea party,"" he enthused.It didn't.Here's why.""The Exorcist"" had been a publishing phenomenon several years earlier, in 1971. William Peter Blatty's terrifying, believable and well-written novel had taken the country by storm -- like nothing, perhaps, since Margaret Mitchell's ""Gone With the Wind."" The film of ""The Exorcist"" two years later was an equal phenomenon. No one had ever seen images like these, heard lines like these, or so starkly faced a graphically horrific cinematic depiction of Evil like it before.Then, a few years later, along comes ""The Omen."" The entire project, from conception to realization to novelization felt like, and is, another in the long history of Hollywood cynically cannibalizing success.The book, written simultaneously with the script, by David Seltzer, is an evolving example of ""synergistic marketing."" But neither the book nor the film ever achieved the legendary status of ""The Exorcist"" novel and film.It DID make money, however. Particularly for Gregory Peck, whose deal gave him a percentage. It became his most financially successful endeavor.Aside from the ""me too"" cynicism underlying the creation of ""The Omen"" trying to capitalize on the worldwide success of ""The Exorcist,"" other factors worked against it.First: the Stars. Lee Remick and Gregory Peck were terrific actors. They were also household names.NOBODY in ""The Exorcist"" was a household name at the time, with the possible exception of Lee J. Cobb. That lack of instantly recognizable actors helped anchor the ""realism"" of ""The Exorcist."" These people didn't look or act like movie stars: they looked like us.Gorgeous Lee Remick and handsome Gregory Peck, on the other hand, had been movie stars for decades. No matter how wonderful their performances (and ""The Omen"" was hardly the high-point of either career), they were still glamorous movie stars acting out lives of incredible wealth and prestige as the parents of Damien.Despite Ellen Burstyn's portraying a screen actress in ""The Exorcist,"" we never get even a hint that she's particularly rich, or a glamor queen. She's a working actress, that's all.Basically, then, we've got old Satan at work in a supposedly real-life story of an exorcism which first became a massive best-selling novel and then a massively successful film, about ""real"" people being possessed by the Devil . . . versus a derivative film about incredibly rich and glamorous people (what was Gregory Peck? An Ambassador?) unknowingly raising the spawn of Satan -- in the form of a not-terribly-convincing child actor who subsequently went into real estate in real life. A wise consideration on his part, since what's the kid gonna do? Continue playing in ever-less-respectable sequels like, ""Damien Hits Puberty,"" ""Damien's First Date,"" ""Damien Does 'The View'?""No. Real estate is the logical choice. Harvey Stephens is no Haley Joel Osment.Had ""The Omen"" come before ""The Exorcist,"" either as a novel or film, it might have gleaned more respect than it does today.Even admiring comments here admit the film has not aged well.Its original release was considered ""disappointing"" compared to ""The Exorcist."" The fright value was less. The quality of everything from the script to the direction to the production was less. The acting in ""The Omen"" was fine. But, ""if it ain't on the page, it ain't on the stage."" ""The Omen"" suffered, then, by comparison to ""The Exorcist."" It still does. It always will. It's second-rate.The original is always best.",The Omen
207,Phantasm01,Slightly above average but not a classic by any means,6,30 June 2006,"With the impending arrival of the remake, some people out there are engaging in vivid, inexplicable fantasies about how this movie is some sort of classic. Tisn't the case. 'The Omen' is a a fairly decent horror movie, but it's needlessly slow and hasn't aged well. Now, I wasn't around at the time, but ample evidence suggests that the key to 'The Omen's popularity is rooted in the famed decapitation scene and the general creativity and outlandishness of the other death scenes. In short, it relied on shock value, and it's no longer shocking, so you haven't got too much left to work with. It isn't a bad movie, just a very average one, and certainly not one that should be mentioned alongside 'The Texas Chainsaw Massacre', 'The Exorcist', 'Night of the Living Dead', 'Dawn of the Dead' and so on.As if you didn't know, the plot's like this: There's this kid who is the Anti-Christ, and he starts killin' those who find out his true nature, as they generally tend not to be to pleased with this intel. That is, in all seriousness, the short and long of it. Now a lack of plot is fine in horror movies, often a good thing, but 'The Omen' drags us through what little plot there is very, very gradually. We basically just watch the characters figure all this out, which takes them a helluva long time as Thorn wanders from place to place, and are treated to the occasional death scene, which are, again, no longer truly remarkable and which are few and far between. The problem with this film, more than the general slowness and unimpressive plot, is that it can't really generate much atmosphere. I suppose it's impossible to say why a film *failed* to create an oppressive atmospher, beyond that most of the individual occurrences and elements, like the nasty dog and evil nanny, just aren't particularly interesting or unnerving. Contributing to this problem, Goldsmith's much lauded pseudo-Gothic score is cheesy and overwrought rather than ominous. Furthermore, Gregory Peck is dull and unsympathetic as the evil Damien's 'father'. He's mostly just miscast. This is Atticus Finch we're talking about here. He doesn't belong in a horror movie. None of the other performances are of any note at all.Now, I've done nothing but complain, so I must again reiterate that this isn't a bad movie. None of the flaws I've mentioned are fatally bad, but they're notable and, again, it doesn't have anything truly great about it to offset these concerns. Still, the death scenes, the heart of the movie,, are still sufficiently amusing. Again, nothing shocking or especially elaborate by modern day standards, but they're still fairly cool. Nothing you won't have seen before, but most of it is worth a second look.Though I can't know for sure yet, obviously, I can't help but suspect that for once a re-make will actually make the original obsolete this time. I see no evidence that the execution in the remake is anything more than average, but it was no more than average the first time around, and it has got 30 years worth of special effects development on its side as well as tens of millions of dollars. Still, it seems like a waste, since it looks like they've taken an average film, and then made another average, but more slick and expensive, film out of it. Whatever the case, 'The Omen' is now probably only of interest to horror buffs, and they'll almost certainly already have seen it. It's merely passable, but that, of course, means that it is still good enough, if just barely.Edit: I've since seen the remake, and it is indeed superior, though not a great film by any stretch of the imagination. Very much the same thing, but the vastly improved production values and generally livelier performances elevate it quite a bit. The remake is arguably more flatly silly at times, but that just ups the entertainment value.",The Omen
208,CalDexter,"Quite simply, a frightening horror classic.",10,21 October 2006,"The Omen is one of those films that gets better and better with each viewing. As its coming up for Halloween, i watched my DVD widescreen copy last night.First up, the opening titles in white lettering on a black background is simple and straight forward, with a slowly revealing shadow of a young child standing over the reflective shadow of a cross to symbolise something evil is coming, plus Jerry Goldsmith's fantastic score simply grabs you by the throat and is responsible for 50% of The Omen's success.When watching the scene where Robert Thorn first sees Damien being held by the Nun through the Hospital glass partition, i noticed that the director Richard Donner takes full advantage of 'framing' a picture superbly with the Priest watching Thorn in the background reflected in the glass saying 'It would be a blessing to her...and to the child.' I saw this a lot in The Omen. Praise must go to Gilbert Taylor for excellent photography, a man who would later camera Star Wars: A New Hope.The Omen is full of great scares and creepy atmospheres without relying on buckets of blood and gore to freak us all out. The key here is all in the mind. How could an innocent child be touted as the son of the devil? All the cast: Gregory Peck, Lee Remick, David Warner, Billie Whitelaw, Patrick Troughton and Leo McKern play their roles as serious and straight as possible without even a hint of camp or tongue in cheek and it works brilliantly.Every horror film has its 'shocker' moment to send the audience into a frenzy: Alien has its 'chest burster' moment, Scanners has its 'exploding head' moment etc. etc. But The Omen has the most memorable and shocking death scene that intensifies Gregory Peck's mission to destroy Damien. If you have not seen this film, then i won't say...but you will be shocked...or you'll laugh! The emotions portrayed by Peck towards the end of the film are of a man who knows what needs to be done, but still cannot bring himself to comprehend the situation he has found himself in and all the horrible deaths that have happened. It is one of his most memorable and successful film roles. Lee Remick is excellent as Kathy, her performance is very vulnerable which only enhances her character's role as a tragic victim.Special mention must go to Patrick Troughton as Father Brennan, a truly remarkable performance as the despairing priest who seems as if hes on the brink of madness, his quiet scene by the canal with Gregory Peck is one of the film's highlights. David Warner is really good as well as is Billie Whitelaw who is really chilling as Mrs Baylock, even when shes all smiles in her introduction to the Thorn family you sense something really cold about her.Hollywood should hang its head in shame for daring to produce a remake, (which i haven't and do not want to see) a remake that a whole generation will see and think its amazing because they never bothered to view the classic original...it baffles me why they thought they could make one better for a film that was very successful first time around.See the original Omen...it is a Horror Classic and a lot more thrilling and entertaining than The Exorcist.

It is the first film in the Omen series and it is based on a horror novel by David Seltzer.Though part of a cycle of similarly-themed movies, The Omen has gained prestige over time for a number of reasons: its respectability (as a profitable major-studio film with renowned actors), its seriousness (it plays as a contemporary thriller, rather than with the knowing excesses of certain aspects of the horror genre), and the originality of the movie's Jerry Goldsmith score.The movie followed at the tail end of a cycle of 'demonic child' movies: Village of the Damned, Rosemary's Baby, and most notably The Exorcist, and was itself followed by sequels (see below) and a number of copycat films such as the Italian-made Kirk Douglas movie Holocaust 2000. As a general rule, the children concerned get older as the cycle continues, from the newborn of Rosemary's Baby to the teens of such films as Carrie, The Fury and Halloween.A new version, The Omen, was released on June 6, 2006 (06/06/06).",The Omen
211,CaressofSteel75,A tired looking horror film,6,19 December 2014,"A decade ago I may have rated The Omen at 8/10. At the time of its release this movie gave The Exorcist a run for its money as the big-budget box office devil-drama champ. I saw The Omen again recently and noticed that it's just not aging well.The principals of Gregory Peck and Lee Remick are still enjoyable, but two generations of Satan movies later, the whole thing seems stale.Gregory Peck plays the supposed father of the devil boy, Damien. After a series of malevolent occurrences he realizes who the boy really is and travels to Italy and the holy land to find help in destroying him.There are some famous scenes in this movie that have become icons in the horror movie business- most especially the maid hanging herself during a party and Damien knocking his mother off the second floor balcony, but other than that, there's really minimal shock value in the thing. The filmmakers feed you a fictional and contrived antichrist theology to sell the whole idea. It spawned two mediocre sequels.The Exorcist was better in concept and execution and even though Rosemary's Baby had already gone before it, it started off a whole horror genre in the '70s. The Omen was the next big thing a few years later but definitely hangs a few rungs lower on the ladder. it's better than Poltergeist though, I'll give it that.",The Omen

213,persian-belle,Promotes Religious Bigotry and Violence Against Children,1,23 October 2012,"As a child, this was my favourite horror film. Back then, the Omen and the Exorcist were the most talked-about horror flicks that even kids had to see somehow!!! I was quite spooked by the scenes, the sounds, and ohhhhh that background music! However, as an adult, I cannot imagine how idiotic it is to call a child the Antichrist because bad things are happening around him or caused by him.We know nowadays that there are normal youngsters as well as those who are challenged, who are capable of bad things, even things so bad we may call them ''evil''. Now come on, if I saw a boy even commit murder, I would say that he's definitely in need of help. Something's going on for him not to have any empathy or remorse. He's either under tremendous amount of stress or need psychiatric intervention.Yes, I know that this is a supernatural film and has nothing to do with reality. Nevertheless, the viewer cannot really enjoy the film unless she or he finds the plot somehow plausible, at least a little. If you do not believe in a boy capable of being evil, you would never want a father (adoptive or biological) to kill him.The success of this film, the Exorcist and such feed on the ignorance of many, unfortunately. How do you know that after watching this film (which quotes the bible, BTW), is not going to look at his son's head looking for marks of the devil? Many films are based on similar situations in real life, except in horror movies many mundane issues are often given a supernatural explanation. I enjoy spooky films, even those which I know are unintelligent (like a curtain moving may be caused by some unseen hand!), but I cannot stand seeing a child being seen as evil. That makes me afraid for the consequences of watching this film.I'm not religiously affiliated, fortunately. I also understand that many people are not directly affected and will not make life choices based on a horror film. However, this film teaches that a child can be evil, rather than stressed, mentally ill, in need of help, or maybe simply innocent.Please do NOT watch it, don't let your kids watch it, and don't let any religious people watch it. All we need in this day and age is more people embarking on a crusade against children with problems.",The Omen

216,FilmFreak94,My all time favorite horror film,10,21 May 2011,"The Omen is a brilliantly made movie about the Antichrist coming to earth in the form of a little boy and his father trying to figure out the mystery behind his son. The film has a great cast of characters led by the always excellent Gregory Peck who plays Robert Thorn the adopted father of the Antichrist named Damien.At first Damien seems to be a normal boy, but by his fifth birthday strange things begin to happen to the people around him. It first happens when the nanny hangs herself at Damien's birthday party. This sets the stage for a new nanny, Mrs. Baylock(chillingly played by Billie Whitelaw) who has been sent to protect Damien. A priest tries to inform Mr. Thorn of his son's true identity but Robert doesn't believe him. But when Katherin Thorn(his wife played by Lee Remick) is injured and the priest suspiciously dies his suspicions begin to grow. He is approached by a photographer named Keith Jennings(played by David Warner) who has been studying the photos of the nanny and the priest before they died and has discovered that strange blurs in the photos predict how that person is going to die. Now Mr. Thron and Jennings travel to Italy where Damien was born to find out if his son really is the Devil's child.The Omen is a brilliant psychological thriller that has stood the test of time and is still just as scary now as it was back then. The soundtrack in particular is the scariest part of the movie and Jerry Goldsmith definitely deserved that Oscar. If you haven't seen The Omen(or if you were forced to watch the remake) then I would suggest you check it out. It's not a movie that everyone will love, but it is worth the watch.",The Omen

It took me three days to watch it to the end, not because it was creepy or scary but because I found myself wondering off to do dishes or clean the fridge or just struggling to stay awake. It's a movie that is almost 2 hours long without commercials about a kid that might be the anti-christ but in the end nothing really happens. The suicide in the first couple minutes is the creepiest part of the movie and creates an expectation of unusual behavior and the movie ends up being most people talking about nothing interesting enough for me to remember.",The Omen
218,badfeelinganger,"Unforgettable.One of the best films of 70s, as well as one of the best horror films ever made.A landmark of satanic cinema.",10,27 September 2014,"One of the best films of 70s, as well as one of the best horror films ever made.A landmark of satanic cinema.A truly frightening chiller. A definite classic of the horror genre.In 1976 The Omen was a hit among critics and audiences hungry for more after The Exorcist with its mixture of Gothic horror and mystery and its plot about a young boy suspected of being the personification of the Antichrist. Directed by Richard Donner best known later for his Superman and Lethal Weapon films, The Omen gained a lot of credibility from the casting of Gregory Peck and Lee Remick as a distinguished American couple living in England, whose young son Damien bears ""the mark of the beast"". At a time when graphic gore had yet to dominate the horror genre, this film used its violence discreetly and to great effect, and the mood of dread and potential death is masterfully maintained. it's highly entertaining. Jerry Goldsmith's Oscar-winning score works wonders to enhance the movie's creepy atmosphere.It was the performance of Harvey Stephens as the young Damien that invested the film with the chill of genuine credibility. Richard Donner's direction is taut. Every actor are all are strong. Goldsmith's score took the film to a level horror films generally never attained in the 1970s. Viewed thirty years on, Richard Donner's demonic classic remains one of the finest horror movies to have been put out by a mainstream studio.The movie boasted a particularly disturbing scene, in which a character willingly and joyfully hangs herself at a birthday party attended by young children. It also features a violent decapitation scene (caused by a horizontal sheet of plate glass), one of mainstream Hollywood's first: ""If there were a special Madame Defarge Humanitarian Award for best decapitation,"" wrote Kim Newman in Nightmare Movies (1988), ""this lingering, slow-motion sequence would get my vote."" fares a whole lot better than its 2006 remake.Influenced by the success of The Exorcist, this film takes the horror genre one step further and instead of a girl being possessed by the Devil, we have a boy who's the Antichrist.",The Omen

The music is pretty good, but is used in very odd moments. I love when loud music is used to show anxiety and fear and straight up horror from the characters perspective, but the times it was used made it feel melodramatic.The guy who goes with the main character and helps investigate and find clues is the best actor and I believe he took the role and made it his own (as much as possible). Everyone else felt like they could be replaced with your run of the mill ""serious guy"" or ""attractive woman"".I am pretty disappointed especially since ethos is up there as a horror classic.Light 5 out of 10, I can't really recommend this movie unless you have never seen it before and are big into horror.",The Omen

It's idea biblically and the way that the creators organized their ideas were quite admirable as well.I would say that this, like ""The Exorcist"" and ""The Exorcism of Emily Rose"" challenges your faith, and tests it, but if it were just more original, I'd be perfectly, 100% content with giving it ten stars.

Well, for any film junkie out there who knows a thing or two about either the first original ""Superman"" and the ""Lethal Weapon"" franchise, they will know that Richard Donner was responsible for them...as well as ""The Omen."" If there were any two horror movies that stuck out the most in 1976, they would have to be this and ""Carrie."" No way around that. God bless Richard Donner for this work of art.Lee Remick and Gregory Peck are two parents who want nothing more than to have a child of their own. They try and they try and fail. The answer to their prayers comes in the form of a baby born to a mother who had recently died in childbirth. They take the baby home and name him Damien. And that's when things get exceptionally creepy.Fast forward a few years with a birthday party for Damien. His shady nanny says, ""This is all for you, Damien!"" and then kills herself by jumping out of a window with a rope around her neck. Next, his parents try taking him to church and he cries and struggles in their grasp. If it isn't one thing, it is another with the boy. There is almost no control over him.After a few unexplained deaths and a near-miss or two, Mr. Peck finds out through a priest that Damien was not his own but rather the son of Satan himself and a female jackal, which we know to be the Antichrist. He then discovers that the boy has the mark of the beast on his head, that being ""666"" beneath his scalp. It is at that point that he has no choice but to kill the boy, but police stop him and kill him before he can harm Damien.From what I have heard, doing this movie was no easy feat because of some rather unexplained instances on the set, as was with ""The Exorcist."" In the end, have an open mind when it comes to this movie. You may discover some things that you wouldn't ordinarily know about Satan and the Antichrist. Like all other classic movies, this just had to be remade...but we all know that the 2006 version couldn't possibly measure up to this one. It's just not possible.Anyway, with all other classic movies, you may want to watch this one with the lights on and with a few people around you. The suspense by itself will make you jump a considerable distance and it's good when you have one or two people with you so that you don't have to do it alone.

An American politician,Gregory Peck,adopts a child Damien, but as he grows up it becomes apparent that he is not all that he seems to be. in my opinion this movie ,even though 30 years old,is still one of the creepiest films i have ever seen. To begin with the eerie religious music gives the film a starting block as it helps to build the tension and strangely enough gives the viewer a sense of evil. Second of all you watch this film with the sense that the good guys just cannot win and that ultimately evil will triumph. The little boy is certainly very creepy but is supported by an outstanding cast.Gregory Peck and Lee Remick are excellent as Damiens foster parents who are drawn into something they cannot understand,David Warner is also good as a photographer who senses ,thru his photos,that evil is in the air, but the most chilling supporting character is the creepy nanny who has sworn to protect the child . She is played superbly by Billie Whitelaw and i think that she is probably the most chilling and disturbing character in the film. I cant see much wrong with this film.The direction is fast and basically non-stop,you really don't get a chance to breathe and the deaths are not overly graphic but just graphic enough to hold your interest. What makes this film verge on the border of sheer brilliance is during the funeral at the end when the final shot pans to the back of Damien's face and he turns and smiles.Even though i have seen this film many times i still get goose bumps at the end and i personally think it is the creepiest smile in the history of the cinema.

229,Pigalina,Love it!,10,18 October 2005,"My dad told me that The Omen is to be remade, (it will be called The Omen 666). Why? It is a fantastic movie. It is because nobody can come up with any decent ideas nowadays so that have to rehash great films from the past. Everywhere you turn there is either a TV show being made into a movie, some rubbish sequel being churned out or a film just being remade entirely. (On IMDb.com I did notice there are 3 Omen sequels already). If they remake The Omen with heaps of blood and gore and stupid over the top deaths I will be so mad! I'll go on a grape squashing, tissue tearing frenzied rampage. They'll probably have some American kid in it too that talks a lot. Julia Stiles is to play Damien's mother - isn't she only about 24? Goodness! The Omen is fantastic - it has a good storyline, it is scary and creepy without the use of chainsaws, knives, blood or chase scenes. Damien is also great - the scene where he goes psycho in the car is very well done. I also love his clothes (being made in the seventies there are quite a few pairs of mini flares). Mrs Baylock, Damien's nanny is like a nightmarish Mary Poppins. It is a long film but there's a lot of story to fit in so it has to be. Another great scene is the tricycle scene. It is simple yet effective, what a horrible boy we all think, yet it also looks like an accident because he was just so into riding his trike. Is he really evil or was it just Mrs Baylock's fault?

I don't know about the re- make that just came out, but it would be tough to top this film. Although I question some of the supposed quotes from the Book Of Revelation from the Bible (there is no ""s"" in Revelation, the screenwriters showing their biblical ignorance.), the movie is still a good witness to people who don't believe in Satan. They might after viewing this movie.A startling, dark and Gothic horror thriller that has became one of the most popular horror movies of the 70's spawned two sequels, a recent remake and a few imitations, Damien became a recognized horror character along with Regan from ""The Exorcist"" back then. It's a biblical horror epic that has frightened audiences for years since then! The acting in this movie is very good even by Peck, Jerry Goldsmith's score is pure classic and some creative shocking kills like the unforgettable death of the priest makes some of today's CGI kills look like a walk in the park.The characters played by Gregory Peck and Lee Remick may be the ""beautiful people"" - rich, powerful and privileged - but they are still real people, and quite accessible. Kathy is a strong but emotionally fragile woman who seeks help from a psychiatrist. Robert will do anything to protect her from heartbreak and pain. It is their devotion to each other that makes this film so tense as we watch their lives unravel. Robert thought that by taking Damien in, he would simultaneously save his wife from grief and give an orphan a home, but the road to Hell is paved with good intentions, and in this case, that road is very real.This is a great film, filled with vicious Rottweilers, nasty deaths, powerful music and great performances by the entire cast. Should not be missed by film buffs in general and horror fans in particular. ""The Omen"" is just really good. It was released the same year as Exorcist if I'm not mistaken and Gregory Peck gives a fine performance. The part where a character's head is lopped off and rolls across a street in slow-motion, and then director Richard Donner cuts to a whole new sequence, is really chilling and bizarre.",The Omen
233,adog2001,My favorite horror movie of all time.,9,6 May 2021,"I first watched this film when I was 10 and I didn't fully get it but I thought it was good so I rewatched it in 8th grade and loved it. I am now almost 20 and I am no horror movie fan, but this is my favorite horror movie of all time. All the actors did really good in this movie and the characters were really good too, even the villain of this movie Ms. Baylock (RIP Billie Whitelaw) was awesome. The premise of this movie was really good too. I won't give away many spoilers but the fact that these parents adopt a kid and don't realize he is the son of Satan was really interesting to me ever since I was a kid. If you love horror movies, check it out. It is so worth seeing. A+ in my book.",The Omen
234,Spinetinglers,Always avoid people born on the 6th June!,10,13 June 2006,"Always avoid people born on the 6th June  especially if they are called Damien and bizarre violent accidents seem to happen to those around them! Since this film has recently been remade, I thought it would be a good time to look back at the original  a horror classic!In 1973, 'The Exorcist' broke all boundaries; previously, horror movies had only concentrated on the dark side, there were hardly any references to main stream religions. The basic rule was if the Devil was in it, God wasn't. Even Rosemary's Baby released five years before has hardly any reference to God or a more heavenly supreme being. The reaction that followed the release of The Exorcist was that the public loved it but the censors didn't and it was banned in the UK for twenty five years. The Exorcist may have fallen foul of the censors but it opened the flood gates for this sort of movie and three years later The Omen was released on 06/06/1976.What do you think a good horror movie should have? Is it a superb cast, a brilliant score, a battle of good versus evil artfully portrayed on screen, or maybe a sinister and ambiguous open ending? No matter which of these sways your opinion 'The Omen' has all these and much, much more!!!Firstly, let's look at the cast, Lee Remick and Gregory Peck are the leads, these two names are nothing short of Hollywood elite. Lee Remick is perfect as the mother who as the movie progresses realises there is something very wrong with her child. (I'm not sure what tipped her off  was it the baboons attacking her car or her son's feral reaction at the thought of entering a church?) Gregory Peck again is perfectly cast, as no one does noble and principled like Mr Peck. However, it is not only the leads that are terrific, the supporting cast includes David Warner and Tommy Duggan who both put in notable performances but it is Billie Whitelaw that eclipses them all as Damien's overly polite yet sinister nanny. The score of a horror movie is very important, it has to chill to the bone and help create and maintain a feeling of an ever present danger. Jerry Goldsmith's soundtrack is probably one of the best scores ever written for a horror movie. It is perfect for The Omen, gloomy, disturbing, chilling music, interlaced with what sounds like religious choirs portending the end of the world. It really is that good and if you don't believe me, consider the fact that it won Jerry Goldsmith an Oscar the following year.By this stage, I know that most of you who were considering going to see the new Omen film at the cinema are now thinking to yourselves 'maybe I will rent the old one instead!' but for the few that are still on the fence here are a few other points to convince you. The 1976 version had a great plot, a child adopted into the corridors of power, whose destiny is to destroy the world, this is a simple and perhaps unoriginal premise however David Seltzer quotes Revelations at every turn and comes up with very original ideas to kill people off. Today, we are used to seeing a lot of blood and gore when people get killed in this genre but this is one thing that the omen lacks. Gore is pre-empted by well choreographed violent outbursts, each one being more frightening and compelling than the last, from a priest being impaled by a church spire to a reporter being decapitated by a pane of glass. These events all build to the foreboding finale. In the last scene we see a little boy, holding the hand of the President of the United States, turning around and smiling at his father's funeral. What greater ending could there be!?!The Omen stands out in this genre and has stood up to the test of time. To-day horror movies are packed with the latest teenage idols and gratuitous violence has replaced good plots and imaginative thinking. (There are exceptions to this of course, Dog Soldiers, The Ring etc.) The Omen combines, a great cast, a great score, and brilliant storytelling without a teenage idol in sight.",The Omen
235,MovieManiacX,A Genuinely Spooky Film,10,18 January 2005,"This film is actually one that still scares me. The idea of the unknown, Hell, and The AntiChrist is brought to life here perfectly. The movie is original and at times, painfully sad and gruesomely violent.The acting is great. Gregory Peck is convincing as Thorn. Lee Remick is good as the frightened Mrs. Thorn. Billie Whitelaw is fantastic as the crazy, psychotic, devil-worshipping Mrs. Baylock. Even Damien himself is unsettling. But the best performance comes from David Warner who, as Keith Jennings, is fantastic.The deaths in the movie are very creative. They are similar to the deaths in Final Destination, but three times as effective. A hanging, an impaling, a decapitation, etc. While these are not in any way bloody or gory, they are still immensely shocking and very frightening.How everything was deciphered from the Book of Revelation into modern day context was very clever. Saying how the devil will rise in the ""sea of humanity"" (I'm not sure if that's entirely correct) was equivalent to Damien coming to power in the world of politics only made everything seem more realistic. Absolutely excellent.The ending is perfect and I'm glad it leaves you feeling uneasy. If you watch this, watch it at night in complete darkness. I guarantee you will be creeped out.",The Omen

But the baby is born dead. Katherine doesn't knows it, so a priest proposes Robert to change the baby who was born at the same time and whose mother died in the childbirth; Thorn accepts and, five years later, the boy, Damien, begins to behave strangely and soon his parents discover that he is the Antichrist.This is sincerely a wonderful and unforgettable film that will never get me bored.

Their child, Damien, sure does seem to be around when lots of ghoulish accidental deaths take place. Perhaps it's all a big coincidence or maybe it really is the forces of evil. The film wisely keeps all of this a mystery and lets the audience make up its own mind.The Jerry Goldsmith score is also wonderful and gives the film a great sense of impending doom.",The Omen
240,gregmovies,"A very good horror movie, but it feels a little outdated",7,11 September 2008,"The Omen is a fun horror movie, but there are better ones out there. The movie certainly pales in comparison to the Exorcist, and hasn't aged as well. The acting is very good, especially from Billy Whitelaw who gives an awesome performance as Mrs. Baylock. The use of music was good, and the atmosphere well done. Unfortunately, the movie moves at a rather slow pace, and doesn't seem to benefit from this pacing. The film could have been trimmed down a bit without affecting the story.Overall, I give The Omen a 7/10. Definitely worth seeing for horror fans. The remake is pretty good as well. The Exorcist is still the greatest of the 'possession' films.",The Omen

It happened one night when the Thorn couple was expecting their baby. Instead they wound up with an adopted infant who's real mother was an animal. They named the new born boy, Damien (which probably was a really innocent name until this movie came out) and he eventually grew into a kindergarten aged murderer with the ability to communicate with rottweilers and order them to do his nasty willing. After his nanny hangs herself (she became possesed) a new satan worshipping woman comes to take her place...she is a follower of the devil and caters to his every need, also telling him what to do.By the movie's end he has killed everyone in his immediate family despite efforts by Gregory Peck to kill the little sucker.

242,mack-38,One of those movies that will keep you guessing,7,19 October 2001,The 1976 Omen is a great piece of story telling and not knowing too much about the bible it held my interest through out the film.

As usual Jerry Goldsmith music is so haunting through out the film.,The Omen
243,writerever365,What Horror Movies Lack Today,9,2 June 2015,"This film is a perfect example of how far the horror movie genre has fallen. In a world of instant gratification and an ever-shrinking attention span, filmmakers have to resort to intense gore and cheap jump scares to scare an audience, with a few notable exceptions (Conjuring, Oculus, etc). This movie is an example of how fresh and innovative a horror movie could be, as well as how moving it could be.(I find it highly unlikely that anyone doesn't know the big surprise in this film, but just in case, ""spoilers"" ahead)What's so intensely scary about this movie is what so many modern horror filmmakers have lost sight of. It isn't so much WHAT IS that's scary as the prospect of WHAT COULD BE. The idea that this child you've reared, loved, and embraced for five years is actually the devil incarnate - the idea is simply terrifying. The idea of having to slay your own child - horrific. The thought that your house has been overrun by demonic forces, and it is up to you alone to try and remove them - wonderfully scary.Now, don't get me wrong - ideas are not the only scary thing in this film. This film offers plenty of good scares, but the typical jump scare is rare here. The building tensions, the chill-inducing chorus and their never-ending mantra - what happens in the film is scarier than any jump scare the movie does have.Also, the use of gore - there is blood, and when it happens, it's substantial. But the use of gore sparingly is light years more effecting than pervasive balls-out, in-your-face gore. It's used sparingly so that when it does happen, it's more jarring.All this to say, see this film. Don't fall for the cheap cinematic thrills put before you today. See this film, and see what horror used to be.",The Omen
244,bayhorse,The Main Story Line is Anything But Fantasy!,10,19 November 2006,"Mr. Stephen Hanchett's book, Is George Bush the Antichrist?, is much more carefully reasoned and impressively researched than the movie, here; but, with a dangerously misleading limitation which ultimately and ironically serves to make it the fulfillment of II Thessalonians 2:11!!! Is George Bush the Antichrist? The answer is, paradoxically, both yes and no--but, more basically, the answer is no!--Just as the selfsame description applies to Hitler! Embodying the true configuration of Biblically Prophetic Patterning (but without being able to elaborate adequately, in this brief space, upon most of the finely and scripturally/historically demonstrable details) is a comprehensively paradigmatic unfolding of the story of Joseph (Genesis 37-50), from the time he was sold into slavery by his eleven brothers (the other sons of Jacob), until the time of the Exodus, subsequent to his death. His having been sold into slavery was a prophetic foreshadowing of Exodus 1:8-14. His having become a servant in the Egyptian house of Potiphar represents the physical nation of Israel under the Old Covenant Law. His removal, from there, to Pharaoh's prison (but, in his case, like unto Christ's, whom he foreshadows, on a false charge) represents the numerologically and historically decipherable (Leviticus 26) 2520-year period of national punishment inflicted, first, upon the even hitherto displaced, but not for much longer (Ezekiel 37:15-28), and ""lost"" ten tribes of Israel at Samaria (II Kings 18:9-12), and, then, over one-hundred years later, upon the Kingdom of Judah at Jerusalem (II Kings 25), for Israel's breach of the Covenant of Deuteronomy 28. The first half, or 1260 years, of these world-ruling empires, or seven heads, of Revelation 13:1, culminates with the wounding of Rome, the seventh head, or fourth beast (Daniel 7), in 476 A.D.; just as the second 1260 years, from 554 A.D., with the healing of Rome's mortal head wound, by Justinian, to 1814 A.D., with the fall of Napoleon, consist of the ""Christianized"" or ""Holy"" Roman Empire, an eighth beast (Revelation 17:11), which both is and is not of the seven, in that it is and is not Christian (Galatians 1:6-9), but fundamentally and ultimately is not (Matthew 6:24) (Mark 9:38-50) (Revelation 3:15-17; 18:4). . . . Moreover, this eighth beast is, not only on the seventh head, but is also an image or reflection of the original beast, with still another seven heads and ten horns. Charlemagne, for instance, is, as the third horn and first head on the resurrected or eighth beast, a mirror image of Nebuchadnezzar; while, at the other end, Napoleon is a mirror image of Alexander the Great, and Hitler is an image of Antiochus Epiphanes. Most intriguingly, though, just as there is no head like unto the seventh, there is no head like unto the seventh of the seventh (Daniel 7:7). With the fall of Napoleon, is to be found the benchmark date of the restoration of the birthright promise to Israel, originally bestowed, by God, through Jacob (Israel), to his two half-Egyptian grandsons (the sons of Joseph), Ephraim and Manasseh, the ""Great Nation"" and ""Company of Nations"" (British Commonwealth) existing today (Genesis 48). The concept of American Manifest Destiny is biblically-rooted, but also bitterly betrayed by those blessed and honored with the duty of fulfilling it, as a virtuously magnanimous example and inspiration to the world! Because of this tragically modern repetition of the ancient breaking of the Covenant by Israel, the Birthright Nations shall again be taken captive, but, this time, for 2520 days instead of years, divided, again, into two 1260-day intervals (Revelation 13:5), which structurally reflect the 2520-year intervals, but in reverse order. The ""Man of Sin,"" in II Thessalonians 2:1-8, who was finally revealed, when the explicitly pagan Roman Empire had been moved out of the way, ruled for 1260 years. Currently, she (Rome) is a widow (Revelation 18:7), minus her ""Holy Roman Emperor"" upon whom to ride. However, She shall be uniquely, overshadowingly preeminent, once again, when the ancient beast rises, one last time, over the ashes of the Birthright Nations. . . . In that particular vein, here's just a small structural indication of how history repeats itself, but not exactly in the same ways, although unaccidentally close enough--here--to be Divinely-instructive, teleologically as well as axiologically! Compare Hitler's invasion and carving up of Czechoslovakia to the current occupation of Iraq; just as Iran shall be, for America, what Poland had been, for Hitler, and Germany--and the world! Obviously, then, Joseph's removal from prison in Egypt, and appointment by Pharaoh as the second most powerful man in Egypt, represents the crushing of the head of the eighth beast, in 1814, and the reinstatement of the ancient Birthright Promise to Ephraim and Manasseh, a material and national blessing, to be distinguished from the Scepter Promise to Judah (Genesis 49:8-10). And, of course, the shortly-upcoming dissolution of the Birthright Nations (Revelation 12) is anciently symbolized in the Pharaoh who ""knew not Joseph,"" and the bitterly tragic consequences of that! The ancient ""Apocalypse"" which God, through Moses, had brought upon Egypt, was a type of what shall shortly occur on a global scale, when the seventh seal opens, as it does only once, at the beginning of the latter 1260-day interval shortly to come; while the first six seals open three times, with the last, or ""Anti-Typal"" opening shortly to occur, at the beginning of the first 1260-day interval. . . . For a continuation of this critique, go to the first sequel to this film, Damien: Omen II.",The Omen
245,mitchelledwards,A Smartly Written Horror Thriller,10,12 July 2009,"What I like about The Omen is that instead of relying on gore and jump scares. It is more of a psychological thriller than anything else and all of the scares work because of that. Richard Donner's direction is very good considering that this was his first major film, the angles are inventive and one of the things I really liked about the direction was that he focused on the eyes a lot. For a horror film this film attracted a lot of brilliant actors and actresses and I think that this is one of Gregory Peck's most honest and memorable performances, I also like Lee Remeck's vulnerability. The kid they cast as Damien was very creepy and the character of the nanny was enough to keep me up the first time I saw it. There are some plot holes that I have never really understood, for instance I don't get how a human boy can come from a Jackal but that's really my only complaint about the film. The ending is brilliant and I really like the fact that the producer's decided to keep the kid alive. Definitely rent this or even buy it but be sure to get the two disc edition that has a very informative commentary and very entertaining documentary about the making of the film.",The Omen
246,rhiron,Don't Let Him Kill Me!,9,7 November 2013,"Hollywood has this annoying tendency to remake films that don't need to be remade! Alfred Hitchcock's genre-defining 'Psycho' (1960) got a shot-by-shot remake, so did 'The Producers' (1968), and so did this film. What next, a remake of 'Jaws' (1975), 'The Sting' (1973) or even 'Citizen Kane' (1941) or 'Casablanca' (1942)?!If nothing else, the remake proved that you cannot improve on the casting of the original. Gregory Peck and Lee Remick are such a convincing screen couple that you could even believe that they were not acting!! Their respective ages at the time of filming are even consistent with those of a couple desperate to have their own child before it is too late, which lends credence to the plot, unlike the remake. David Warner actually developed the character of Jennings from a one-dimensional character into someone with a bit more seediness and sudden tragedy, so to praise David Thewlis in the remake is to praise him for usurping another's performance! And Billie Whitelaw, though literally the nanny from Hell, is such a fun and malicious character that you don't mind the nagging feeling that people as wealthy and renowned as the Thorns would never allow her near their child! Even Jack Palance's daughter, Holly, gets a very memorable role as the Thorns' original nanny, whilst Leo McKern gives a fanatical performance as archaeologist and exorcist, Carl Bugenhagen, which he would continue into 'Damien: Omen II' (1978).The plot itself focuses on the lie that Peck's character, Robert Thorn tells his wife, Kathy (Remick) to conceal the fact that their child was apparently stillborn and that, in desperation, he secretly adopted a child to replace it so as to spare her the overwhelming grief. It's a classic horror/thriller set-up that you continue to see in original films today.Director, Richard Donner insisted on stripping the script of all glaring Satanic references so as to focus on the inner plight of both Thorn and his wife as they come to suspect that their 'son', Damien (Harvey Stephens - in a role that redefined creepy/evil children in films and culture, generally) is, shall we say, not quite right. After all, wasn't it the blissfully ignorant Del Boy who took Rodney's advice in naming his own son Damien? Damien lives a happy five years with his adoptive parents before all hell breaks loose and both Robert and Kathy are driven to breaking point.The point of this film (unlike the sequels) is that it is all about interpretation. Is Robert Thorn's lie getting to him? Or is little Damien really a devil incarnate? Most think the latter, but Donner wanted to leave the audience guessing and, in many ways, 'The Omen' is best seen as a standalone film, even though the sequels are certainly worth a look.A key point of this film is the fantastically eerie and bone-chilling musical score by the legendary Jerry Goldsmith, who earned an Academy Award for his work on this film. And rightly so! It is just a shame that Goldsmith, the musical talent behind such films as 'The Planet of The Apes' (1968), 'Chinatown' (1974) and 'Alien' (1979) didn't win one more often!! Go ahead, check your film collection - Goldsmith quite possibly figures in it!And, even though both the fashions and the special effects seem a bit dated, they are part of the charm of the film. Damien inspired a whole (black) mass of imitators and sequels and remakes, but the original truly shines above all of them. Quite clearly inspired by both 'Rosemary's Baby' (1968) and 'The Exorcist' (1973), 'The Omen' delivered at a time when horror films were all the rage. It was very, very lucky to lure in such stars as it did (particularly in terms of securing such classic American actors as Peck and Remick), as horror was something of a dirty word in cinema at the time and, rather than being another American horror film, the politics- heavy plot is set primarily in the UK, with both Italy and Israel providing a further backdrop to the devilish proceedings.The death scenes are great but, unlike the sequels, the focus is not on them. A lot of odd happenings transpire that drive Robert and Kathy literally out of their minds whereas, in the sequels, every odd occurrence is literally a death of some sort.Plus, an interesting point that has not been lost on reviewers is that the fictional Thorn family throughout this and the sequels seems to reflect the real-life Kennedy family. Robert Thorn, alike Joe Kennedy, is American Ambassador to the Court of St. James and the Thorns continue to suffer a succession of tragedies throughout the 'Omen' series until Damien Thorn himself is compared to JFK in the 'Omen III: The Final Conflict' (1981).Literally the best in the series, this makes fine Halloween viewing or, if you're like me, you may find this to be a rollicking good psychological thriller for any time of the year -- perhaps one that bears the most re-watching!The only reason that I have not given it 10/10 is that the technical specifications of the time are not always great. Picture and sound aren't perfect, but aren't even half as flawed as they are in a film like 'Charade' (1966). Really, it's a small complaint for such an entertaining film and I feel overly picky just writing this! So, there seems little more to say, except ""Ave Satani!""",The Omen

In a first moment may seem topical, the eternal struggle between good and evil, but in this case the evil is represented in the figure of a child, Damien, who happens to be none other than the Antichrist, but the concept which is given here is fascinating.For evil appears as an invisible, pervasive and lethal element in the form of accidents in appearance may be the result of chance and luck. These accidents have yet appear to affect only certain chosen victims that may hamper the rise of the son of Satan. Sure, the child itself is harmless, but those dark forces who monitor it a mortal being to those around him, a being whose only goal will be the maximum possible personal power to dominate the world, in this case the president of the United States, bringing the Apocalypse.The performances scratch at a high level. Especially the kid, whose dark and deep look combined with white and angelic face, commands respect and fear, barely utter more than two words, it seems, yet does not seem human, Gregory Peck, as usual, recreates a character with seriousness and firmness and a point of desperation that increasingly emphasizes the film, the beautiful Lee Remick, who suffers with seeing the calamities that are happening to him, and David Warner, convenient and ally photographer as you go Peck, and a brutal end in every way.Special effects, despite having many years, still resulting great and realistic. They look better and more frightening than those generated by computer. Scenes such as the beheading of poor Warner by a sheet of glass keeps impressing authentic. I really do not know because the cinema today is increasingly leaving aside what ¨ artisan, when it is clear, that often achieves an equal or even better effect. And here's the proof, since the photographer's death Remake not even half hits. There must be someSpecial mention Jerry Goldsmith, composing a successful and thrilling music. Keeps well the bewildering atmosphereThe story also achieves something difficult it is to keep the intrigue and tension for almost the whole film, culminating in a climax that is frontally against the concept happy ending. Donner showed great ability to shoot Jan this genre and it's a shame not to do more similar work.This is definitely the Omen, a powerful film that skillfully blend, suspense, intrigue and supernatural horror, and even adventure could also say, by the two forced companions, visiting several places in the world, with a concept and novel approach to the devil and evil itself, and although it has aged enough, has not ceased to be a source of inspiration, or rather exploited for hundreds of films, such as the idea of an evil invisible and catastrophic adopted in the highly entertaining and famous ¨ Final Destination.Do not miss it.",The Omen

You've never seen Gregory Peck like this in the edge-of-your-seat superflick like you've ever seen him before! I wonder what he would say today when he first did ""The Omen"" Anyway,this movie's got everything:nanny hangs herself,devil dogs,Damien hitting his mom,priest gets impaled,evil chorus music,etc. THE LIST CAN GO ON AND ON!                           One of my favorite scenes of ""The Omen"" is at the drive-in zoo, the baboons start attacking the car while Damien and his mom are in it. The devil dogs attack,they should have a show in FOX: When Satan's Dogs Attack!!! and don't forget about the famous decapitation scene of versatile Brit actor David Warner, it's a classic!    THIS MOVIE ROCKS!!!",The Omen
253,eldakim,Terrifying even to this very date,8,14 May 2006,"The Omen. I have seen this whole movie on TV one weekend and expected it to be a non-scary outdated horror movie. i guess I was wrong. The story itself is basically about the anti-Christ and his birth. This film had an awesome cast, including Gregory Peck. I didn't really expect him to be in such a scary film.The movie's entire mood is dark and the oldness of the movie actually helps. No, it is not cheesy like all the other horror movies out in the theaters these days. Rather than showing disgusting images and chase scenes of one monster like all the modern horror movies, this one leaves you disturbed and terrified at the most. I felt so disturbed by this movie, I couldn't sleep for a day. The plot of this movie and the horrid idea that Peck's son is indeed anti-Christ himself just leaves you gripping and horrified. The clues and the disturbing presence just builds up and supernatural occurrences just scare the hell out of you. I felt goosebumps watching this movie. This movie indeed tops as the scariest movie I have ever seen.",The Omen

255,Al-160,Scary as HELL!!!,9,15 March 1999,"This is a great movie and it's scary too!! The whole atmosphere in this movie with apocalypse music, just makes you wanna SCREAM!!!!",The Omen
256,Stevenuccj,far better than most satanic/Catholic horror films,8,19 May 2001,"Interesting piece of work concerning the birth of the supposed antichrist; its best points are the Oscar-winning creepy music, the horrific and fairly original death scenes, the performances of the ""father"" and the nanny, and the good use of religious imagery while not getting over the top with it. Film's script is average; performance of the ""mother"" is weak, although it isn't a big deal.  After watching, this film will make you think that maybe all that garbage about the antichrist and armageddon isn't really garbage... 8 out of 10",The Omen
257,RodVar,A great thriller!,8,25 June 2008,"Though it is regarded as a cornerstone of the modern horror genre, this is not a horror film and was never meant to be considered one.The beauty of this picture is that you truly feel fear, you become afraid of this angelic looking kid, but you're never shocked with blood, creatures or anything like that. It's simply psychological, which makes it great.Damien (Harvey Stephens) and Kathy Thorn (Lee Remick)are outstandingly played, as well as wonderfully written an performed supporting characters such as Mrs. Blaylock (Billie Whitelaw), Jennings (David Warner) and Father Brennan (Patrick Troughton). You can't not love this film Gregory Peck, AFI's most beloved hero, gives an awesome performance as Robert Thorn.Richard Donner, did not want this picture to be considered a horror movie, so he made it as believable as possible. Let me say mission accomplished, all deaths can be explained as perfectly circumstantial.",The Omen
258,House_of_Gonzo,Very creepy,8,14 October 2003,"I saw The Omen for the first time today, and boy was it creepy.  The film itself is filmed in such a way that a lot of the horror films of the 70s were done, similar to ""The Shining.""  I didn't see any flaws in the filmmaking itself and just hearing Lee Remick yell out ""Damien"" for the first time just gave me chills, cause I knew what was to come.",The Omen
259,ake465,Probably the greatest horror movie,10,18 October 2003,"Most people (some here apparently not among them) would put The Omen in the horror top ten.  I think it is better than that.  I think it is the best horror movie of all time.  Incredibly tense and frightening throughout, with a very serious theme, great acting, and outstanding technical work, this one just surpasses them all.  Satan as a purely evil, murderous, wealthy child--""Damian"", religious characters, imagery and subject-matter, suspense, crazed, murderous dogs and servants, style, even sex appeal, etc., etc. This goes beyond the Exorcist because it is a bigger, more complete movie, and it beats Rosemary's Baby because it is more entertaining.  Granted, those movies are great and top 5, but this is better.  One of the two roles for which more modern audiences will remember Gregory Peck, the other being the timeless classic, To Kill A Mockingbird.  Peck's stature and dignity are equally great in both roles.",The Omen
260,godfather199,Excellent Movie!!!!!,10,9 June 2006,"WARNING AGAIN: THIS COMMENT WILL CONTAIN SPOILERS.Hey, folks. With the release of the remake of THE OMEN, 30 years later, I thought I should make some comments on the original. I can't remark on the 2006 remake, haven't seen it yet. But I do know, critics are bashing it, but audiences think it's a great tribute to the original. So much for critics. How do they get those jobs, anyway? Telling me what movie, I'm gonna like. If a film critic can write, direct, and act in a film like I have, then they can speak. If not, they should shut up.OK. Enough said on my hatred for movie critics, on to the original, THE OMEN. I saw this movie when I was about 14. Loved it then, love it now. A classic, to say the least.Here we have Robert Thorn, played greatly by Gregory Peck. He's been elected U.S. Embassedor to England. Also, a good candidate to be the next president of the United States. With a great wife, Kathy (played by Remick) it looks like their dreams are coming true. But these dreams will soon become one big nightmare...Robert never told Kathy that their child died during the birth, and he adopted a baby never telling her, to spare her the trauma. So, the child they're raising is THE ANTICHRIST.There are no dull moments in the film. It grabs you from the beginning, as we watch the people we care about die, one at a time. It does have a sad/tragic side to it, which other horror films do not. With several warnings and events, Robert soon learns he's raising the son of the Devil.The music by Jerry Goldsmith is the scariest in any film I've ever seen. Other characters who were outstanding include, The Priest who Robert thinks is nuts, the photographer, the first nanny (what a sore throat) the new nanny who will protect thee, and many more.I highly suggest you check out the original. It's a little dated, but still holds up as an excellent horror film. Director, Richard Donner, knew what he was doing.I give this classic a 10/10.V.M."" I saw it's mother, Mr. Thorne."" - Priest on Morphine. LOL....",The Omen
261,peqdavid5,Psychological horror at its best,10,17 January 2009,"A classic horror film is always defined as the one that leaves a trademark on viewers' minds. But you also need lots of ingredients to make it work: a clever plot, good acting, chilly music, spectacular special effects and, of course, a great villain. And I must say The Omen is my favorite dish in the psychological horror menu. The first time I saw it (it was a Friday night) I didn't think it was a great deal, but when I went to bed, I still had ""Ave Stani"" in my head and my eyes wide open. Then I decided to watch it once more, but after that time, I couldn't stop watching. Of all the ingredients I listed at the beginning, the most notorious and wonderful of the movie was Goldsmith's Oscar-winning score. But of course, it doesn't steals credit from Peck and Stephens' ever-lasting performances, the well-crafted thrills and the surprising finale. Even though it is considered the less valued of the 70's Horror Holy Trinity (The Exorcist and Rosemary's Baby are the other 2), I think is the most enjoyable of those 3.***** out of 5.",The Omen
262,manosnb,Predictable and slow-paced,6,5 August 2016,"I suppose that for its time maybe it was a better movie, but I have to admit that by today's standards this movie is below average. You could tell what was going to happen from the very start to the end, it was not scary at all and the performances besides Gregory Peck's were not anything special. It did contain one or two creepy scenes just for you not to fall asleep. In my opinion, it is nowhere near the level of originality and creepeness of the exorcist. Who doesn't remember the intro music of that old gem without getting the chills? Overall, I think that the 7.6 is very generous if we consider that some of the best horror movies of 90s and 00s do no even get past 6.",The Omen
263,secretron,yawn,5,23 October 2001,"In what was an obvious attempt to ride the coattails of The Exorcist from Hell & back and all the way to the bank, Richard Donner's The Omen, with a few rare exceptions, is an out-and-out predictable snoozefest.  Gregory Peck & Lee Remick play the stupidest parents in the world, as the plot blatantly & purposefully unfolds to reveal their mysteriously adopted son as the son of the Devil (gasp!).  The audience is let in on this nefarious fact about 15 minutes into the film, yet Peck doesn't fully admit this obvious fact to himself until the final reel.  The rest of the film is knee deep in plot contrivance, murky religious symbolism, nonsensical logic & lots and lots of Latin, crucifixes, impalings & hounds from Hell.Peck's right eyebrow remains raised for nearly the entire movie, which I suppose is his way of conveying emotion.  Otherwise, he makes for a fine robot.  Remick fares no better as the bewildered in-denial Mom.  David Warner (nice scarf) is decent as a doomed photographer who ""helps"" Peck unravel the ""mystery"" of his son's origin.Points to Jerry Goldsmith for a memorably creepy score & for the effective casting of a cherubic child actor as Damien.  If you're looking for scares & logic, watch The Exorcist twice.  Hell, watch The Exorcist 3 twice.  5 out of 10.",The Omen
264,ilovejack104,One of the best horror films ever,9,19 March 2007,"The Omen, for me is one of the best horror films EVER made. I preferred this version to the new one and it still stands the test of time.It's amazing that by letting you see the deaths by photograph's of Jennings (david warner), before they happen like, the nanny, the priest and Jennings himself. It's very well done in this way, and although you see the photo's before the deaths the deaths are still shocking.The only deaths that you don't know of are of course damien's mum and dad, that would be spoiling the film a bit.The most horrible death scene is the decapitation of Jennings, it is shocking and has got to be the first of it's kind. Deaths/injury's in order: The Nanny - Hangs herself The Priest - Gets impaled Damien's Mum - Fall's from the stair rail - injured Jennings's/Photographer - Get's decapitated Damien's mum - Get's thrown out of hospital window 7eral floors up.

265,DarthSavagery,The Birth of The Antichrist,10,7 November 2009,"How will the end of the world come about? If Christ is lord then who is his enemy? What or who would give birth to such a thing?This is something that Director Richard Donner and Writer David Seltzer tried to convey in one of horrors most astonishing and shocking movies The Omen, a movie about the child Antichrist and his family, the "" prophecies"" surrounding said child and who if at all can stop him.Robert Thorn(Gegory Peck) and his wife Katherine Thorn(Lee Remick), have a child, on the morning of June 6th at 6 AM, the child is not alive, he only breathes only once, Robert Thorn is told this by the kindly Father Spiletto(Martin Benson), but he is told there is another child whose mother died in child birth at the same time. The child has no family to go to and the hospital is willing to let the Thorns go home with it and the mother need never know. The child's name is Damien (Harvey Stphens, his only role until the 2006 remake in which he makes a small cameo), the thorns adopt him as their ownFast forward five years, strange things have been happening with Damien all his life, he is no normal child, and he is about to celebrate his fifth birthday, the young Nanny(Holly Palance, whom they give no actual name to the role for) is attached to Damien so much so that she will not give him to his mother when she is asked, reluctantly she does, and this sets off events in the movie that are highly disturbingA lot of people complain about the movie not being horror, to me it is horror but not gory, as were many that came out during the seventies and early eighties an era of horror that I think is the Golden age of it or the resurgence of it, because these years gave rise to many franchises that are known today, including The Omen, The Exorcist, and the list goes on. These were the years that horror really shined before a lot of the bad acting gore and sex interrupted it. The Omen is an example of psychological horror at its best, from its cast which includes Grgory Peck, whom is best known for his role in this film and the TV miniseries The Blue and the Grey as President Lincoln which chronicles the US Civil war. The only sad thing about this aside from a lot of the bad things that happened on set is that Harvey Stephens never went on to really shine and I'm sorry but the kid had a career before him.I like this movie because of the fact that it has no blood or gore, all of the scares are in the mind, and yes I will admit I will watch a gory film just look at the Saw series one of my personal favorites! This is the way that horror should be done, and had been done; this movie alone is a shining example of a mind freaking film. I highly recommend the original Omen for anybody who loves good psychological horror.",The Omen
266,sarahjayn1980,I really hope they don't mess this one up with the remake.,10,4 June 2006,"One thing that horror movies often lack is the ""believe"" factor. The Omen (1976) manages to embody a tone of believability while still submerging its audinece into a completely outlandish scenario. Capitalizing on its mainly Judeo-Christian audience's religious beliefs, the Omen does a wonderful job of terrifying its viewers with a subtle build to the most unimaginable and truly horrific outcomes. The most upsetting part of this movie not the moments that break into the extreme or absurd, but rather all the linking moments of normalcy that link them. For instance, the chilling common of a child's birthday interrupted by the sudden suicide of a possessed nanny. It makes for an unsteady ride on a sea of comfort with spurt of conflict. I loved it. We'll see if Julie Stiles can live up to Lee Remnick's amazing Katherine.",The Omen
267,NeglectfulKiller,One of the worst films of all time,1,8 May 2002,"***SPOILERS***   ***SPOILERS*** This so-called ""classic"" is pathetic. The script is horribly flawed, and the film is directed poorly. The movie itself oozes stereotypical nonsense from spiritually naive people. Don't read on unless you want to be spoiled. The antichrist is afraid of coming with in 100 yards of an epicsopal church? Lol. He's trembling just by coming within view of the structure, then at the end of the movie he's lying on the floor of the church and his dad is trying to kill him, and he seems relatively calm. The inconsistency in this film is nauseating. What the heck did that first nanny have to do with Damien? What was she talking about before she hung herself? Why do Rottweilers have the power of telepathy and mind-control? Why does the second nanny visit the mom in the hospital, push her out the window in front of onlookers, yet 3 days later she's alone at home with Damien instead of in police custody? Why is Gregory Peck 18 years older than Lee Remick? Who in the world was the evil priest, how did he know everything, and why was he so vague with the Embassador if this was so important? Where did the photographer come from? Who was ""Bugenhagen"" and why did he know everything? Why was there so much non-Biblical fantasy invented for the script, such as having to kill ""Damien"" with a series of knife blows on hallowed ground? This movie was not believable for a second. The writers obviously had the Biblical knowledge of pissants. This is the king of all turkeys. Ovoid at all costs, unless you particularly enjoy making fun of stupid people. Kickboxer with Jean Claude Van Damme has more credibility than this. The only real question left to answer is this: why did Gregory Peck accept this horrible role? His acting was very good, as usual, but this lemon stained his career in the eyes of anyone who can see through this wafer-thin, logic-devoid cowdung. Avoid at all costs. 1/10",The Omen

Instead of putting more horror element or gore/scary moments, this movie mostly dealt on Peck's emotional hesitance. The entire movie was kind of showcase of Peck's acting power and whoa! What a super actor he is!! But apart from his good acting, there is nothing in this movie which can glue the audience to the screen. The so-called scary moments are not at all scary. The dog was cute and the several dogs scene in old graveyard was pathetic. The killing moments were funny and ending was, well, kind of expected.So as a fan for horror genre, I am quite disappointed, but still it is not a trash for some good drama and acting.My rating 7 is mostly dedicated to Gregory Peck. Without him, I would give 2. At max.",The Omen
269,mikeylvsmvies,One of my favorite scary movies,8,16 October 2010,This movie is one of my favorite scary movies. I first saw it in 1997 when I acquired it on VHS. I now have it on DVD as well. In it Gregory Peck portrays an ambassador whose wife suffers a stillbirth. He agrees to claim a healthy newborn as the couple's own child. All seems normal until the child named Damien turns 5 and his first nanny hangs herself in the midst of the 5th birthday party for him. A priest warns the ambassador that young Damien is the Antichrist. Gregory Peck's performance as the ambassador had a gravitas that he brought to all his performances. Lee Remick was effective as his wife. Harvey Stephens is particularly creepy as Damien. The major supporting cast is excellent. If you're in the mood to be creeped out catch this movie.,The Omen
270,twogunrosie,Intellectual Fear Riegns Supreme,9,5 October 2016,"With all the horribly made modern horror films, I decided to step back in time to see if the quality of horror movies has always been so low. The Omen is proof that some classic horror films still outshine what has been made more recently.The Omen does not insult us with cheap scare tactics, gross-out special effects, blood and gore, senseless action sequences, or moody dark lighting in an attempt to obscure what we're supposed to be afraid of. Instead, this movie educates us with religious symbolism, historical religious references, and intellectual thought without preaching to us.Evil is something that cannot always be seen outright - it masquerades as the everyday norm. That is what is truly frightening - the thought that we might be standing right next to pure evil and not realize it. And thus the basis for this movie is born.The characters, just like us, are normal people living normal lives as the slow realization comes that they are not only living with evil, but raising it as their child. It takes intelligence, thought and logic to come to this conclusion and the revelations come gradually, intensifying the movie as it progresses.The actors were natural, their actions and reactions authentic, and talent far above par for the acting methods and standards of the 70's. Even by today's standards, this movie was excellent and much better even compared to modern movies.I gave this movie only a 9 due to one plot hole: When the new nanny showed up, the parents did not investigate with the agency or try to figure out where she came from. This is however an acceptable plot hole due to the time constraints of the movie.",The Omen
271,killer_tray,a story behind the story,8,6 October 2006,"For all those who wish to know more about the birth of Damien: Everything was ready, timed to perfection, the child would be born of the 6th of June at 6am. They knew Thorn would except the child, he do anything for his wife, to keep her happy and content. all they needed was a man who would kill without mercy, without thinking twice. Brennen, the priest who had come to them so long ago in his time of need, they had given him freedom, and life without sorrow. His time had come to prove himself to the dark lord. Spiletto told him of the message that had been sent from Satan. A child, his only son, would be born of a jackal on the date of 6th of June at 6am. it was their responsibility to put the boy in good hands and keep him there til such a time when he would rise to take what his father would give to him. Thorn's wife, she had wanted a child more then anything, and Thorn knew it. They had had two of their hopes gone, and now she was pregnant again and it had lasted the full nine months. She was ready for a child and would be shattered if this one left her also. B'aalock, a fellow satanist, would take care of the jackal through pregnancy and would present the child to Thorn as they had planned. Baylock, B'aalock's sister. would take care of the child when they felt his powers were starting to show. As for Brennan, he would have the hardest job of all. The killing of The boys mother and Thorn's child. Spiletto was sure he would do it, Brennan had proved that many times. The unholy night finally came and the Jackel's howls were unheard from the basement of the hospital, while Thorn's wife cried out with pain above. They called Thorn half way through the birth, to be sure he would reach them at the right moment. The children were born at the same time, both healthy. Thorn's wife, exhausted form the ordeal, fell into a deep sleep before she knew if he son was alive. she would never see her son again, at least to her knowledge. B'aalock took the child silently from the room and down to the basement, handing it to Brennan. Brennan slowly placed the child of the table beside the jackal, who was resting. Then, taking up a sharp, heavy rock, he struck at the jackal to the head, killing it. Then, one again raising the rock, aimed it at Thorns son. He struck the boy to the head, it cried out then moved no more. Brennan quickly dumped the jackals corpse in a crate, nailing it shut. Then did the same with Thorn's son, he hadn't even be named yet. Above, Thorn was jogging down a corridor to find a lone priest waiting for him, grief in his eyes. The priest told Thorn that his son was dead, his wife well, but had no knowledge of the death. He convinced Thorn, that if he loved his wife, he would take a false as his own. Thorn requested to see the boy. B'aalock was carefully preparing the boy, cleaning him, wrapping him in a blanket, checking under his jet black hair for the birthmark. She left the basement as Brennan moved the crate containing the boy's corpse towards the back door. Suddenly, he heard a cry from inside the crate. Opening it, he saw the child, still alive, crying in pain. He quickly took up the Rock again and hit the child again. After a moment, he quickly closed the crate, breathing heavily. it was over. the child was dead.",The Omen
272,coolfreshair-1,Scary classic,8,11 August 2007,"I first saw this movie on TV when I was 14. At the time I found it so disturbing I couldn't sleep for days! However, having now viewed this a number of times I think one of the key elements of this movie's success is the fantastic chilling soundtrack, which only enhances the feeling of suspense and evil which is a bubbling undercurrent throughout the film.There is an edge of constant paranoia with a mix of inevitability throughout the movie. Although you know certain characters will come to a sticky end way before it happens you are kept in a certain amount of suspense (which will keep you on the edge of your seat) until it does.This movie is a definite classic in my books, and even now, many years after my first viewing I still feel slightly edgy after watching it.",The Omen
273,highwater,A Truly Classic Horror Film,10,15 March 2002,"Although many people no doubt consider The Exorcist to be the best horror film of the 1970s, I would cast my vote for The Omen.  It is a very atmospheric film, eerie and spooky -- even the soundtrack is really, really creepy -- with a few hair-raising scenes to jolt you out of your seat (the body count in this movie is not actually very high, but when Satan decides it's time for someone to die, it will definitely grab your attention).One of the great strengths of The Omen is its cast, which is really superb. Gregory Peck is perfect as the American Ambassador to England, and his distinguished portrayal lends a touch of class to the whole production. The rest of the cast is also excellent -- Billie Whitelaw is flat-out frightening as the nanny from Hell, David Warner is great as the photographer who helps Peck unravel the mystery of his adopted son, and Lee Remick is effective as the frightened and troubled ""mother"" of Damien. Even the actors with very limited screen time turn in terrific performances, particularly Patrick Troughton as the seemingly insane priest and Leo McKern as the all-knowing archaeologist/exorcist.One of the spookiest aspects of this movie is that the ultimate villain here is not only extraordinarily formidable but totally unseen, which really adds to the ominous, doomsday-is-around-the-corner atmosphere.  When the camera casually closes in on a truck parked on a hill, and the emergency brake mysteriously releases itself, you know something bad is about to happen but you don't know what it will be.  And when it does happen, it's worse than anything you expected.",The Omen

Billie Whitelaw was fabulous as the evil Governess,she was very expressive and done her part really well. David Warner as usual gives his best performance and Patrick Troughton is simply remarkable. Last but not the least, the child actor Harvey Stephens delivers a spellbinding performance, the evil expressions portrayed from the little child is very believable, enough to haunt your mind, right there on your seat. A haunting score from Jerry Goldsmith, lavish scenarios and a neat direction from Richard Donner, makes the film a true classic. If you love horror classics, trust me you will definitely love this one too. Its undoubtedly a 9.8 out of 10!",The Omen
275,bullett-3,The antichrist convinces his parents that he is just that!,7,22 November 1999,"When I first saw this movie it was in its initial release in 1976. It came on the heels of a true classic in horror; The Exorcist.  It dealt with many of the same themes.  The eternal combat between good and evil,  the place the Catholic Church has in all of that,  and the possability that the human beings are nothing more than just chess pieces in this eternal struggle. The Exorcist was a classic; but the Omen was truly a very scary movie. I saw the movie again recently, with my wife who had not previously seen it.  I realized why the movie had scared me so many years ago.  The same scenes that had such an effect on me scared my wife.  The cemetery, the dogs, two strange priests and of course the rolling head.  Some cutting edge horror for it's time. And of course the film deals with the eternal battle with the only son of a powerful American ambassador as the ultimate weapon of evil, now incarnate here amongst us. Gregory Peck and Lee Remick are well.....Gregory Peck and Lee Remick: strong, handsome, gracious, wealthy, perfect. Exactly what you would want a first family to be.  How ironic just a few years before the release of this movie we had a first family that fit this image so perfectly.  And they too left behind the perfect, handsome, well connected, gracious prince.  Here of course it falls apart because by all accounts he truly was a good,gracious, righteous prince.  But the irony cannot be missed given the release date of this film. I found however that the film now worked on me on a level that it had not back in 1976.  As a parent of three the concept that I might be asked to kill one of my children is now a far more terrifing concept than the dogs in a cemetery.  To convince me that one of those children was the antichrist would be inconcievable.  That is why the final scene is now the scariest for me.  Dragging the child through the holy confines of the church to impale him on the alter is beyond comprehension for any parent. And that is the main weakness in the film.  We know early that the child is pure evil.   If the script had kept us guessing, along with his parents it might have worked better.Not all of us might have been hoping Greory Peck saved the world.  Some of us might have been saying"" For God's sake your wrong.  The boy is just a little strange.  Leave him alone"". Maybe it would have been better to be left with the question  "" Is the boy the antichrist and deserves to die,  or are the parents just paranoid and committing murder?"" It probably would have made for a better sequel. Even so a very scary movie that deserves an  EIGHT.",The Omen

This one doesn't hold up well....,4,27 January 2004,"I remember this movie being just the scariest movies ever; I actually recall reading the movie ads as a 7 year old (yes, even then!) and thinking Gregory Peck's first name was ""Georgy."" :)Anyway, I remember finally getting to see the Omen on cable and being quite impressed; however, I saw it recently and am sad to say that it does not hold up well at all.The whole ""Child-as-Satan,"" ""Dog-as-Satan,""""Anything You Want as Satan"" themed movies are now cliche almost 30 years after this film came out, so there's one reason why it looks so cheesy after so long. I noticed is alternately quiet (sometimes filled with overbearing dialogue)and terribly noisy (I hit the mute button during the scary dog attack..! Dogs barking, the 2 men yelling, and that horrid Satanic Mormon Tabernacle Choir going to town! My ears!!)I guess another thing I disliked was the altogether SERIOUSNESS of the movie....is there anyone who smiles in this movie just because they're happy?? Okay, maybe Lee Remick. Once. *SPOILER* I still recall the Mad Magazine parody where as Gregory Peck's character is about to kill Damien, he tells the cops, ""But you don't understand, this child is the DEVIL!!"" and the cop responds, ""Eh, my kid's no angel, either, but I'm not gonna KILL him for it!"" LOL I would've liked to had a couple jokes thrown in here and there...someone with a pitchfork, Damien learns his multiples of ""6"" very quickly...a cameo by Marilyn Manson...ANYthing to lighten the mood!Kinda funny that Holly Palance (Jack's daughter and used-to-be co-host of Ripley's Believe it or Not) plays Damien's dedicated, yet tragic first nanny.Anyway, a sad letdown...",The Omen
278,Hilsdong,An excellent adaptation of Seltzer's novel is a good omen,8,10 August 2004,"This classy shocker was included in a book ""The Fifty Worst Movies Of All Time"" and got a complete roasting from the authors.Why? I haven't got a clue.It doesn't seem to take itself all that seriously anyway and what it does offer is a thrilling couple of hours entertainment.It is daft(David Seltzer-the author of the novel,claimed he did it strictly for the money),but it is carried off with sheer professionalism,that you don't really care.Gregory Peck gives one of his best performances of his later career, and when the death scenes appear on the screen-they are brilliantly staged.A throughly enjoyable piece of horror hokum which did really well at the box office,so it couldn't of been that bad eh? Apart from ""The Exorcist"" one of the best of the Seventies.",The Omen
279,misterronaldweasley,The best devil movie ever made.,9,17 October 2005,"Forget the overrated ""Exorcist""...this movie takes the cake as far as demonic movies go. Almost 30 years later it still holds up.This movie has so many things elevating it above the typical genre fare. The acting is excellent by all, featuring some of the best performances ever in a film of this type. Richard Donner's direction is low key and subtle, which was the best way to go about a movie like this, because if you overdo it, it just comes off cheesy. And admittedly the plot DOES sound hokey...a couple finding out their son is the Antichrist could be the start of a really hokey picture, but Donner plays the material just right. Nothing is overblown and there are none of the corny contraptions you might expect in a movie like this, such as red eyes, demons, gross special effects, etc. Rather, the story plays out more like a psychological drama with a horror element. And perhaps that's why it works so well.Jerry Goldsmith's score for this film is legendary by now...simply one of the best horror film scores (or any film score, really) of all time. The score almost makes the movie itself, it's so effective and chilling. From the moment you hear ""Ave Satani"" over the opening credits, you know you're in for a ride.The death scenes are some of the most memorable ever to be captured on film. Not because of the gore element (there's actually very little) but for the bizarre situations surrounding all of them. One character, in one of the movie's most memorable scenes, gets decapitated by a sheet of glass that slides out the back of a runaway truck.I could gush about this movie for hours, but I'll keep it short and just say that if you haven't seen it, do yourself a big favor and pick this little classic up. It's too bad this little gem is overshadowed by the almighty ""Exorcist"" because it is, in my opinion, a much more effective and frightening film. Had it come out BEFORE ""The Exorcist"" I daresay things might have been different, but I guess we'll never know.If you want a truly scary movie that will stick with you for days, this is it. It raises questions about faith, life, and morality while still managing to get under your skin and creep the hell out of you. It also raises questions that don't go away after the film ends. It takes a special movie to do that.",The Omen
280,jordantolman,Well made horror,9,13 August 2019,"This is one of my favorite horror films. The cast is perfect and the directing is wonderful.
There are one or two scenes that are a little dated, but that's about it. The rest is a slow build up that works very well. It actually tries to scare the viewer and succeeds. Other horror shows like the exorcist are honestly not that scary, they mostly try to gross you out with vulgar content. The omen stands apart because based on actual content, it is very clean and uses the story and acting to creat very eerie moments.
On a different note, one aspect of the film that is unparalleled is the score. The music is astounding and really makes the movie. It is perfectly suited and will cause what might be considered average scare top notch. The music stands alone and unchallenged as the best film score in horror.",The Omen
281,cflann01,Classic Horror Story: My Son is The Antichrist,8,3 February 2001,"a charming tale of fate and faith. ""The Omen"" may not the scariest movie of all time, however it is certainly one of the most enjoyable. It is certainly worth your time to rent. By today's standards it ranks as being quite tame; one can only compare it with it `The Exorcist', however the charm of Damien, Rome, and the perfect family life only help to implore the viewer's attachment. The film looks beautiful and flows nicely. The acting is decent, however not one of Gregory Peck's finest moments. Do not bother watching this on cable, pick up the uncut version  you'll thank me later. Simply put this an enjoyable movie that scares and humors the viewer. Pay attention to details, enjoy the music, bring your bible, and pray.If you like this movie: Devil's Advocate, The Shining, The Exorcist, Rosemary's Baby, Village of The Damned (original! b&w)",The Omen

It's an old movie, obvious by the quality of film and clothing styles! but a great story nonetheless.  There aren't many movies that give me that ""creepy"" feeling but this is definately one of them.  My friend says that ""religious"" movies are really great horror movies and I tend to agree (Exorcist, Stigmata, Prophecy) I also think I understand more about my Christian roots with these and other movies of this type.

285,SlayerRob,Fantastic Horror Film,9,10 December 2003,"If you were to find out that the reason your child had been acting funny was that because not only was he the epitome of all evil, but also the son of Satan, what would YOU do?That is the dilemma faced by Gregory Peck's character in this film, in a very suspenseful, eerie tale of diabolical nightmares.The acting in this film is terrific, and Gregory Peck's performance is impeccable, which really takes the film to another level. 
The pacing of the film works very well, with many suspenseful buildups of impending horror, including some of the most classic scenes of all time.The decapitation, Priest impaling, Damien's famous ""tricycle ride"", Damien's first signs of trouble at the church at a wedding, and the gravesite dig's revelation that Damien's mother was a jackal are all fantastic scenes, classics.The film paces itself so well so that up until the very end you can feel the hairs stand on the back of your neck.The second film was good, but didn't touch this one, and the third suffered from inconsistencies and continuity problems within the series.  But this one is almost flawless.",The Omen
286,Peter34,Was I expecting too much?,3,29 July 2007,"I'm a big fan of horror, supernatural and thriller films. They are my type of films, I've seen many classics and last week I got this film. I red it was a classic and it was a ''must watch''. I had high expectations, so I started watching the film. IN the first hour, I just really noticed that the film was lacking character development, the main character, he's name is named rarely, it does though mostly at the end. That new lady that comes in the house of Robert, who is she exactly? They should have put more background but of course in the end we get to know who she is, the little boy, not a lot of background. Same goes with each character..The story was okay though, no doubt about that, nothing special but nothing good. Robert played a good performance in the film, the other characters were horrible. I was disappointed with this film, the lack of character development and detail made the film bad but what made it more bad was the story. Yes i know, i said it was okay, it was but, they had to put more and focus more. It's hard to explain..but anyway. The ending was good but it still doesn't make sense..I don't recommend this film at all unless you really want to see it.3 out of 10 is my score for this film.",The Omen

288,SenderBex,Lets go round again,8,17 December 2004,"The bi-annual showing of The Omen on BBC1 is upon us again, and as usual starts around midnight on a week-night. Late for work the following day, then.....I first saw The Omen when I was twelve, and although I was unable to sleep with the door closed for two years after, I have become a lifelong fan.Director Richard Donner perfectly captures the imposing gloom of England in the Autumn, which sets the tone for all that follows. I love the early scene on the Thames embankment when the priest meets Gregory Peck to tell him about his son - the sense of foreboding is most striking. Also, the graveyard scene in Italy where they travel to find the tomb of Damien's natural mother is feverishly disturbing - I still have palpitations whenever I hear the dogs....... There are some great frights throughout, but it's the subtlety elsewhere that delights the most. For example, the usage of slow-mo camera when Peck checks Damiens scalp for 'the number' generates an effect that is extremely unsettling, especially when the frame pans and you see the nanny watching from the doorway. I can't think of a more creepy scene in any other film.Roll on Wednesday night......",The Omen
289,nlangella1,"Truly evil, yet exciting to watch. This tops Orr Rosemary's Baby.",10,1 October 2014,"I remember first seeing this as a kid. What a great story line and plot. The remake was good too, but not as good as this version. Truly the best horror film depicting the anti Christ. The Omen even tops over Rosemary's Baby. Exciting from the beginning till the very end. Damien (the anti Christ), was born from a demonic jackal, and adopted by the U.S. ambassador to England, Robert Thorn. Although Thorn doesn't realize that he adopts the devil's child, he chose to adopt one (whom he thinks is just a human infant), because he was told that his biological son dies as a stillborn child. He also kept this adoption business a secret from his wife so that she wouldn't be disappointed. Later on during the film, he soon discovers the horrifying truth about the death of his biological son. His biological son was killed by demons. Truly convinced by a photographer, a priest, and some other guy who lives in the very spot where Christianity first started, it's up to Robert Thorn to do what is nessacery. Kill the anti Christ child before he rises to power and fulfills the Book of Revelation.",The Omen
290,lprice99,scary picture,8,6 April 2000,I have recently seen the omen and I would have to say that it is a very good somewhat dated picture.  It is quite fun to watch all of the surprising and somewhat shocking death scenes.  I especially like the now infamous decapitation scene and the part where the priest gets impaled by the pole. The effects are pretty cheesy but the part at the cemetary is very intense and scary.  The overall look of the film has not withstood the test of time but still it has very good cinematography. This movie is well worth a viewing for fans of the horror genre.  I would recommend this film to people looking for a good viewing of a scary picture.  ***/**** stars,The Omen

Said and done,i went to rent this movie and started watching. Twenty minutes passed,nothing happened. One hour passed,nothing. When the movie ended i was so disappointed and could not understand why i even bothered to finish the movie. The kid was so darn annoying,the acting was so bad that i almost lost my faith in humanity. The plot is terrible. How this is considered horror is beyond belief. I guess i just cant understand these old horror movies,as almost all of them that i have seen have sucked. This movie can be summarized like this: Family gets worried about their little boy.

293,tvshankar,Curse of the Satan,8,28 December 2004,"There's no doubt that 'The Omen' was one of the scariest movies in the 1970s, second to that of 'The Exorcist'. Both these deal with enemies of God; in 'The Exorcist', it's a girl who's possessed by a devil,and in 'The Omen', there's a child who is the Antichrist himself!! It's perhaps strange to have the central antihero not physically killing those around him, but whose evil energy is doing the deed!! The scenes in the movie where a photographer takes pictures of those who later died under strange circumstances, and the photographs revealing uncanny marks running diagonally across the person exhibited in the photographs, which seems to foreshadow what was going to happen, is quite frightening! Even more frightening is when the photographer shows a photo of himself to Robert Thorn (played by the late Gregory Peck) which shows a mark running through the photographer in the picture, which seems to foreshadow that he's going to die too like the others!! And sure enough it happens when the photographer is horribly decapitated later in the movie!!! Gregory Peck displays great intensity in this film and this is the second time I have watched his performance (the first time I saw of him was as Captain Ahab in the film, 'Moby Dick' (1956)). The film, though it doesn't have great special effects as would please a modern audience of the horror genre, it's nevertheless really scary than the movies of nowadays which seem to have stepped a little away from the real essence that provides great scares and chills!",The Omen
294,Jo Nanite,Two ways to watch,6,7 August 2000,"This is one of the few movies that truly has two completely different but equally enjoyable ways to watch.  (Off-hand, the only others I can think of are 'The Princess Bride,' serious romance vs. tongue-in-cheek fairy tale, and the original 'Evil Dead,' too-cheap horror vs. knowing horror spoof.) You can watch it alone, late at night, with all the lights off, and be genuinely too scared to sleep that night; or you can watch it one day with all your best movie pals and laugh your head off at the over-the-top acts of satanism, way-too-serious plotline and the idea that large, easily confused Rottweilers are the harbingers of impending doom.  It's to this movie's credit that it manages to pull off an idea as hard to swallow as the literal birth of the Antichrist with a completely straight face, and still manages not to scream 'B-movie badness' with every line. Though almost every element of the movie on its own seems ridiculous (Gregory Peck as the father of the Antichrist!?), it all somehow comes together in a solid, above-average horror flick that everyone ought to see just to realize that it can be done-- that there is a decent, and very enjoyable, middle ground between your laugh-a-minute 'crawling horror' flop and the all-out grotesquerie of 'The Exorcist.'",The Omen

297,jonestimmy-29776,'The Omen' - Just Can't Get Enough,8,30 September 2015,"As a teenager growing up in the 21st century, I have been witness to horror films after horror films that consistently, for the most part, are very cheesy, unoriginal, and downright stupid. In the modern age of special effects being more important than the actual acting, more and more unknown actors are being placed in horror films and given credit where credit is not due.Contrary to all of these films, The Omen truly shocked the hell out of me. Very few films have been able to do this. Most of the other horror films that have genuinely scared me rely on gimmicky jumping- out scenes. The Omen is one of those films that may not have many jumping-out scenes, the twisted, Satanic plot itself is enough to scare the pants off of you.So, if you're into a jaw-dropping plot, stellar acting performances, and frights leaving you checking behind your shower curtain every time you go to the bathroom (I'm guilty of this), The Omen is most certainly for you.",The Omen

But dammit he ""gets the job done"" in this one (also see Cape Fear the original). Warner ... very underrated actor. Saw another reviewer say the same thing. Didn't steal it from them, but I do agree. Brilliant in this film anyway. Don't see ""The Island"" if you can help it. He actually saves that wretched movie! When that first Nanny jumps off the window ledge and crashes into the window below...? WOW! The first time you see that scene... if the hair does not stand up on your arms and the back of your neck at the same time.... I don't know? Are you human?!? Maybe you're ""The Anti-Christ"". And Mrs. Blaylock... I don't get nightmares very easily, but that is the creepiest performance I have ever seen in my entire life. Talk about brilliant casting and a super job of acting. Holy Crap Batman! Unreal movie on the heels of The Exorcist. Completely different film, but equally compelling. I see these people giving this movie a low rating, and I think... they just want to find fault with something great. Makes themselves feel better about themselves, I guess. If it's not your ""cup"", then why watch it to start with? Just to find fault? It's not Disney here people.if you are actually a fan of the genre, and you don't like this movie... I don't know?

299,stephenneale67,The peak of Satanic Cinema,9,11 June 2010,"The Omen is a truly accomplished work, brilliantly conceptualised and delivered and, in 1976, released to a world that was still susceptible to all things Satanic, coming on the back of such epics as Rosemary's Baby and The Exorcist. Indeed, The Omen represents the peak of this thematic era and has never been bettered. It is a film that works well on so many levels, taking a fantastical storyline - based around the child of a woman impregnated by a jackal - and yet somehow making it seem plausible. This is achieved through a combination of dynamics, foremost among which is the homework carried out by the writer, David Seltzer, in seeking to fulfil the apocalyptic prophecies of the New Testament Book of Revelations (principally the emergence of the Anti-Christ) through a twentieth century cinematic medium. Added to this, is the wonderful cast drafted in to imbue the scenario with credence. The film makers could scarcely believe their luck in securing the services of Gregory Peck in the lead role of Ambassador Robert Thorn, one of the most iconic stars of mainstream cinema, known for being choosy about the roles in which he would deign to appear, yet consenting to completely depart from the mainstream in this capacity, presumably because he too was inspired by the script and its potential. Marlon Brando once famously described Peck as 'wooden'. Reserved, perhaps, certainly steadfast and un-excitable, but either way - ideal for this part, serving as a well-balanced, level-headed, sensible diplomat, not at all disposed to the realms of fantasy, yet who is progressively forced to accept that he is nurturing the son of Satan due to the compelling sequence of events that unhappily befall him. Then there are the wonderful supporting acting abilities of Lee Remick - the woman he loves and so passionately strives to protect; David Warner - the photographer who pieces the mystery together, helping to persuade Thorn of the reality of his situation by coolly and clinically presenting the evidence; Patrick Troughton, who delivers possibly his greatest performance as the guilt-ridden priest; Billie Whitelaw as the truly creepy nanny - 'an apostate of Satan'; and - of course - the young Harvey Stephens, as the child, Damien, famously smiling among the tombstones at the end of the film, as all around him who have tried to thwart his diabolical destiny have been returned to dust. But above all, the film works simply because it grips the viewer on a psychological level, the intrigue maintained by excellent plot development and pacing, beautiful camera work and an unforgettable musical score throughout by Jerry Goldsmith.",The Omen
300,garsy,Still one of the best frightners!!!!!!!!,9,25 June 2001,Still one of the most engrossing horrors of modern cinema. The story of a well to do American ambassador and his wife adopting a child only to find that he is the Antichrist is a great story. Although many films have tried to emulate the story none have quite matched the pace of this film. Bille Whitelaw as the nanny encapsulates the performances and delivers the true atmosphere of the movie. If you haven't seen this film or just not seen it for a while watch it now and be knocked over by its power to impress.,The Omen
301,vampire_hel,Evil is do darn cute.,10,12 May 2006,"I know this movie is old and all but I love it. Damein is such an evil little cutie.

Not the lame poor excuse ones like the newer Amittyville Horror, which personally I found very lame. I love this movie and all the other Omens. Also because of this movie and the much to me comedy ""The Exorcist"" many other people have tried making other Satanic related films, which turned out to be total flops. But if you looking for a mild fright ""The Omen"" is the movie for you. You should also try looking into the other films. Howerver I was disappointed with the third or was it the fourth one.

Let me just say that the 2006 remake is a pointless and useless movie. The remake did not elaborate on anything that The Omen (1976) didn't all ready do. In fact, it is almost a shot for shot remake. So what the hell was the point in remaking this f*cking movie!? I understand if you watch a movie and think, ""Hey I can do this better"" and then you attempt to do so, but the remake was the same movie with nothing new to offer at all. So save yourself the trouble and see the original so you don't have to watch Liev Schreiber and Julia Stiles try to act.The original Omen also had a huge impact on horror film making. It is one of the first movies to have outlandish death scenes. Like the famous decapitation, which ,to this day, still is one of the best decapitations ever filmed. Future horror films would follow The Omen's lead, especially during the slasher craze of the 80s, and have violent, bloody, and original death scenes.Do yourself a favor and see this classic movie and skip the weak remake.",The Omen

Other than a few grim death scenes, which are rather cheesy looking by today's standards, there is nothing that would really want to make you close your eyes and mute the TV. However, it's the after-effects of watching the movie that really get to you. As soon as it is over, you want to hide, or run to the nearest church. I would definitely consider this a psychological thriller. The acting is all top notch, (suprising for a horror movie), the dialouge is not dumbed down, and the music (it's called ""Ave Satani"", for anyone who wants to listen) is absolutely one of the best scores ever written. After seeing the movie, it will make your blood run cold when you hear it. So grab some popcorn, turn out the lights, and get ready for a scare.",The Omen

305,aazell1-853-695525,Horror At Its Best!,9,4 October 2010,"Ahh The Omen.. I have to say there are few horror movies that make me look over my shoulder while out on a dark night but this is one of them. It's just so damn creepy! How is it that a Hollywood movie directed by the same guy who brought us Superman can touch such a raw nerve? Having given this a lot of thought I have come to the conclusion that it's the overall feeling of impending doom that really chills us to the bone. We the audience are in on the plot. We know who Damien is. We also know that anyone who discovers the little cherub's secret is in serious trouble. From the moment they suspect something is up they are doomed to a grizzly random death.All we can do is sit and helplessly watch as they meet their hapless end Add to this the utterly evil portrayal of the Nanny by Billie Whitelaw which is excellent. Polite but obstructive, protective to the point of sinister and ultimately a maniac with a kitchen knife she's utterly convincing. Towards the end of the film you get the impression that the nursery has become a sort of inner sanctum which Damien rarely leaves. Just crossing into the room feels threatening.The other thing that makes The Omen so much fun is the adventure of discovery that Gregory Peck and David Warner go on. Having set up the ""once you know you're dead"" premise we then are kept on the edge of our seats as the guys travel to Italy and Israel to discover each element of Damien's heritage. We feel that evil is snapping at their heels every step of the way (literally in the grave yard scene)! Having teetered on the edge of your seat for the last hour and a half, Donner and crew take us to breaking point as Peck returns to his home, hell bent on killing the impostor child that's destroyed his family. Jerry Goldsmiths score pounds your ears as Peck drags Damien up the church aisle toward the alter intending to send him back to the hell from which he came and you're rooting for him all the way! Will he succeed? Won't he? Come on! Come on! It's a fantastic movie experience and if you haven't seen it you've sorely missed out on a movie classic...",The Omen
306,casillasj171,Get a Preist to Obsolve from watching this snore fest.,1,25 January 2019,"Warning Possible Spoilers:I saw how widely acclaimed this movie is and it has been years since I saw it so I decided to watch again. Unfortunately I fell asleep halfway through it. In the first half hour we see when the ambassador and the father agree on switching the baby that ""passed"" away with Damien. After that we see briefly the child growing up nothing crazy happens until the child's birthday. Here his nanany is with Damien but then super loving and protecting mom takes Damien away. While this happens Damien looks at her and next we see her standing on the roof with a noose around her neck and as you may have guessed she jumps and while this happens there is a Rottweiler and apparently no one notices the dog but then the dog is noticed when the new nanany who is to protect Damien which is why I believe the original nanany was made telepathically to kill her self brings the dog inside after a couple of scenes. All the while the acting is as if the lines were just being read through. The mother at first is infatuated with her son but then notices small things. When they go to the church the almighty anti-Christ begins to tremble and slap around his mom all the while in front of the other patrons at the wedding. And funny enough screaming for help. Like really suppose to be this big bad demon and yet he cries when driving up to the church. Then in another scene they go to the animal zoo where you drive through similar to what six flags has with their safari part of the park. During the drive through the baboons begin to go crazy since animals can sense what we as humans can't do in this situation it would be the evilness of the child. While they hop on the car the almight ant-Christ again calls for his mom and cries and yells for help at this part I'm laughing that the almighty who is suppose to bring destruction is literally pissing his pants again. And then there is more mundane dialogue where the priest warns the father but refuses to believe him. Well had he listened to the priest his wife probably would not have been pushed over the banester by her ""all loving son"" and then as she tries to hold on for dear life says bye bye and she falls and lands face first. At the hospital the husband finds out that she lost her child because she was pregnant once again. Again the husband goes on the journey but then again had this battle with himself on believing if it's real or not. All the while anyone who investigates anything about the child is killed off. The movie in essence was trying too hard to claim the glory that the Exorcist created when it first was introduce to the audience. The music score is good but overall I tried to stay awake but it felt like another one of those movies trying to hard to be like its contemporaries.

307,daviesfozzie,best horror film,10,30 January 2007,this i think is the best horror film ever made the actual horror of having your child replaced with the spawn of the devil as all parents do when their child throws a tantrum and refuses to go to school then we all sympathise with Gregory peck but as i say this will always be my favourite horror of all time as being quite old i was able to see not once but a few times in the cinema and i do not think any remake would come close because the cast i think was first class and cannot be surpassed. Furthermore i think that the scene with when Billie Whitelaw attacked him in the kitchen was the best horror scene ever staged an the use of the dogs was superb especially the scene in the graveyard which is infamous,The Omen
308,purgatrio,How Damien got the job...,9,8 July 2006,"Originally, Harvey Stephens' hair was blond. He was labeled as the ""shyest"" little boy on the cast list. When Richard Donner was conducting the audition for the character to play Damien, he only asked all the boys to try to attack him the same way Damien attacked Lee Remick in the car outside the church. After three hundred and some little actors, Harvey Stephens flew out of the line and started punching the sh-- out of him, kicked him in the crotch, and pulled at his hair for almost twenty seconds. After which, Donner shoved Stephens off of him. He ordered the makeup crew to dye his blond hair black, and cast him as Damien.",The Omen
309,hourny1984,scariest movie i have seen,10,12 October 2001,"When i was 11, there was an Omen marathon on the television with episodes 1 through 4 on back to back, and i decided to watch the first. After been more scared than i have ever been up to that point in my life, and still to this day, i was in no condition to watch the last 3 episodes. In fact it was a good 3 months before i was able to sleep properly again.Its now been a few years since i last watched it so im going on memory here, but the scene with the rotwheilers in the cemetary is the scariest in any movie.The plot is very good, very original for its time, and i thought one of the best things about this movie is that, despite all our urges that tell us a child should be a good guy in a movie, you just wish that you could just see Peck stab Damien in the final scene.",The Omen
310,piquet1,Scary as hell!,8,22 March 2002,"I remember when I was just a little kid. It was an evening when I sat alone in our livingroom. My mom had gone to sleep and my older sister was in her room reading some magazines. So there I was, all alone... watching The Omen...At first glance, I thought it was pretty boring, but as the events started to happen and the plot revealed itself, I was like paralyzed. I simply HAD to watch this movie. There were so many impressions throughout the movie and so many images started to come to my mind. Though I was almost scared to death, I just sat there and watched the mmovie from the beginning to the end. Of course I suffered from the obvious nightmares that followed, and that left a fear in me, a fear of watching this movie again. This fear has accompanied me in my adult life, 20 years later.Some days ago, I had the opportunity to watch the movie again. The scenario was almost the same; I was completely alone! I'm so glad that I overcame the fear (believe me, I'm not easily frightened), because I got the exact same adrenaline-pumping experience. This movie has left a great impression on me that I really can't explain, and to cut it short; This movie is still scary as hell!",The Omen
311,Jakedelicness,"Um.....Why a ""Horror"" movie?",3,7 July 2007,"I watched this movie really late at night, so maybe I was too tired to understand well enough, but i was highly disappointed by it. I was high hoped, I guess, because of it's reputation and my grandmother told me it scared the hell out of her when she first saw it. When I watched it I found it more funny than scary. It's like everything about the movie is fine but flaw full: The plot's OK but it's been seen before, the actors are OK but not convincing, etc... That's basically it. It's an ""Ok, but..."" movie. I must say though, there were some interesting moments of the movie. But in overall, I was disappointed. If You find the son of the devil scary, I guess you'd find it scary.",The Omen
312,spiritus-2,You don't want to adopt this child,10,18 April 2011,"This movie is so excellent, it was the first that gave me goosebumps and made me sweat as well! The music is terrific throughout, and the editing and the closeups are perfect too. The most creepy about this film is that the little boy seems so cute and lovely, and seemingly there is nothing wrong about him. The dialogs are interesting and keep you on the edge of your seat. I really liked the idea of foretelling the deaths of characters by the means of photographs. The ending is quite bad, and the most annoying thing is that nobody has the faintest idea about the kid, because everyone is dead who knew who he really is. And that smile on Damien's face at the end as he looks us in the eye...and we DO know, that he is in fact the Antichrist...and everything goes on as it did...and you just want to stab him to death! But you cannot kill the Devil, 'cause it will be always around. This film grabbed me and never let go off me until the end. I only recommend it for those who have the nerves for it, but if you have, believe me, it will be well worth watching it!",The Omen
313,White_Lighter,Classic movie!,7,28 October 2003,"When I first saw this movie I just could not believe how well it had been put together by director Richard Donnor. Harvey Stephens was the perfect choice to play Damien ""cute but evil"". The Scene where he looks at the dog and waves is just a classic! and then there is the score...Jerry Goldsmith won a well deserved Oscar for this movie in which he created two excellent themes ""Ave Satani"" and ""Piper Dreams"" which carry this movie along with brilliance.People seem to always compare this movie to ""The Exorcist""....why???, The Exorcist is a classic all on it's own. The Omen deals with a completely different subject to The Exorcist, while The Exorcist deals with possession, The Omen deals with the child of the devil 'the antichrist'.The Omen has one thing The Exorcist does not have ""a classic score"". The Exorcist used Tubular Bells with great effect which actually was never written for the movie. The Score written for The Exorcist is still vertically unknown to this day.The movie opens with the silhouette of a young boy, the shadow of which gradually turns into a cross. It's simple, yet very chilling, and sets the tone. We then meet Robert Thorn (Gregory Peck). It's Rome, and it's 6am, on the 6th day on the 6th month. His wife Kathy (Lee Remick) has just given birth to a child, which died almost immediately. At the hospital a priest named Spiletto convinces him to secretly adopt a child, whose mother died during childbirth. Thorn agrees and keeps it a secret from his wife. They name the child Damien. Thorn is then promoted, from American Ambassador to Italy to Ambassador to Great Britain. We see the happy family in London, the perfect life. It however all starts to go wrong at Damien's fifth birthday party and to make matters worse Damien's adopted father Robert Thorn eventually learns that he is actually the devil's son (The Antichrist).This movie is a horror classic and will remain a classic for many year to come.***** out of *****",The Omen
314,rm554,"Good old fashioned horror movie, but nothing more.",3,17 December 2002,"Some movies dealing with religious and apocalyptic themes are ""get under your skin and make you think"" scary, and reflect the natures of good and evil represented in the Biblical accounts.  Omen isn't one of those movies, but it sure *wants* to be.  To be honest, I found the film's treatment of religious prophecies too laughably inaccurate to be as chilling as many people have said it was.  If taken as seriously as its creators obviously intended it, then it would seem like extremist religious propaganda!  I didn't find the characters to be intriguing, so their fates didn't upset me. The ending is predictable.  It is a good example of 70s suspense and horror, but nothing deeper than that.",The Omen
315,Mokele,I can't believe it,10,22 January 2005,"I don't understand why ""The Omen"", one of the greatest films of the genre, has such a low rate. This is a true masterpiece for many reasons: unforgettable and terrific moments as the scene in the cemetery, a wonderful score by Jerry Goldsmith, very good performances of all the cast... But it wouldn't be so great without it's perfect ending: that boy is certainly more than you can imagine... and he already knows this when he smiles to the camera. Slowly we enter into the nightmare, step by step, death by death, and at last we have no doubt of what's going on; so does Gregory Peck, but his enemy seems to be stronger than anyone all the times, and maybe that's the most frightening thing about ""The Omen"". Easily the best film of Richard Donner and surely one of the scariest movies ever made.",The Omen
316,christinadepointedulac,Big Evil In A Small Package,10,29 April 2015,"The Omen is a 1976 supernatural horror film directed by Richard Donner. This film was released to wide criticism due to it's intense subject matter. The film stars Gregory Peck and Lee Remick as Robert and Kathy Thorn, a wealthy couple who are raising a son named Damien, played by Harvey Stephens. At Damien's fifth birthday party a strange and shocking incident perpetrated by his babysitter sets off a set of terrifying events that shape the entire premise of the film. Soon both parents begin to suspect that their son is not who he appears to be. Confirmation comes in the form of the constant warnings from a local priest named Father Brennan. On several occasions he warns Robert of his son's malicious intentions. He sends him to Megiddo, a city in Israel. It's here that Robert learns the true nature of his son's conception and how he must stop him. With equally stunning performances from Billie Whitelaw and David Warner, this film progresses smoothly and the viewer is never bored. It wraps up beautifully with a climactic battle between good and evil. I recommend The Omen for anyone who is a fan of psychological/supernatural horror. It's a must-see classic from a decade where film was at an all time high.",The Omen
317,Nosferats,not good as a movie neither as a plot,2,7 March 2016,"Stupid as hell :) Really boring and non achieving goals film. Gregory Peck is wandering around and wondering about his role in this plot... The dark side is never shown, sent or even perceived. Only talking - not a single thrilling scene. The exorcist - this movie is being compared to it - is far better and much more complex. Not only a horror movie but a masterpiece which stays in my mind even a decade after watching it.The omen will be forgotten very soon. Even the soundtrack is repeating the same boring plot musically and it never reaches a ""peak"". Only the short scene with the biking killing is remarkable but Kubrick took it and made it far better in The shining!not worth at all to be watched",The Omen
318,cush2287,superior to the exorcist,9,4 September 2005,"this film i many ways stands superior to the exorcist. while the exorcist leads you through one horrific scene to another the omen is slow burning. gradually it introduces us to a wealthy political family who because of occurrences surrounding their six year old son begin to become unwound. you wont see any head spinning scenes or vomiting in this film. instead we begin to be sucked into a husbands and wife's growing paranoia the evil is surrounding their child. the beautiful thing about the film is that it is never made evident that the son the anti-Christ or even evil. what we do see is many out side influences acting on an already weary couple, that in the end drives them to a confrontation to find out if the child they brought home is truly evil. a first rate film, with great performances from all. it still remains as frightening as when it first came out.",The Omen

321,BillPage,Pretty Lame,5,9 August 1999,"This one has its creepy and shocking moments, but it sacrifices genuine emotion in favor of its silly political context.  True terror is personal; you have to care about the characters to feel the fear. With the exception of Gregory Peck, the actors were given too little to work with to convey any kind of emotional depth.  Lee Remick's character is particularly thin. Damien is more annoying than frightening.",The Omen
322,Nerazzurri10,"The best horror movie I have ever seen, no doubt",10,17 April 2006,"I am only 16 years old. In my life I haven't seen so much horror movies, but this one ""The Omen"", was discovered by a friend of mine. He saw the movie, and immediately told us it is an excellent movie. We came to see the movie without many expectations, but we were so wrong. The movie starts very good, it tells us precisely the facts about the father and the mother. Robert Thorn, an American ambassador who wants a child more than anything. His true child dies on birth, and he takes another kid instead of his true kid. Later, we understand that, this thing he has just done, will be the worst mistake in his life.The whole movie is thrilling, exciting, the acting is perfect, and the movie itself doesn't frightens like ""Friday the 13th"" for example, but it is more interesting and the acting is just wonderful. The end in ""The Omen"" is one of the fantastical ends I have ever seen and will see. The sudden thing that happened just made me scream so hard, I did not think the movie would end like this, but finally I realized that this is the best end of all. The second movie of the series ""Damien: Omen II"" is crap. Boring, not good acting, not scary, not recommended at all.The 3rd movie ""The Final Conflict"" is for me, a great movie. The way the Damien manages the things in the movie is good, and the 3rd movie is really good in my opinion.The 1st movie, ""The Omen"" is the best horror film I have ever seen, and it is recommended for every horror film fan.",The Omen

This is by far the most frustrating to watch. I get that in all horror films the main actor is implied to be blinded and stupid for some reason , but this movie will make you want to break your TV screen.

This is not your average horror film, it has to do with real life things and was a movie that wouldn't just scare you right away it would get into your head. if i had to say this would be in my top three movies I've ever seen. i have not yet seen the new movie but i doubt that it will be even comparable to what this movie accomplished.",The Omen

329,jcastlemanmc,Good for the sake of strange amusing interest alone.,4,13 August 2016,"I just saw 1976s ""the omen"" after my parents raved about how good it was. I had heard decent things about it previously and the Rotten tomatoes score was good, so I went OK. After I've seen it, I have no idea why its held up as as a great example of horror. Because one thing a good horror movie should do is actually SCARE me. Did this thing scare me? Not in the slightest. Do you no why? Because for a majority of this film It was Hilarious. At first the opening is so ridiculously cheesy that a mouse would be in paradise, and then it expects us to take seriously a suicide that is shot and framed so poorly that I wanted to burst out laughing. The choice of score is so over the top at this scene that It only contributes to this feel. I assume that I'm supposed to take this seriously yet its almost shot like a comedy. this one scene is the OMEN for what come throughout the rest of the film. camera-work that do'sent command a horrific presence contributing to a films atmosphere that feels so internally awkward that the whole production suffers due to it. The shots are handled in a position that feels unfitting for the genre. Some characters don't really speak right so its hard to personally relate to them when something bad happens. Not to mention the use of musical score here is horrendous. At time its understated and playing in the back of scenes that don't need it, and at others its so melodramatic that i could feel the quality drop instantly. That isn't to say I didn't enjoy watching the film. All of these factors blend together to make the film so bad that its good, a hilariocity, if I may borrow a term from critic Chris Stuckmann. Though at the same time I don't feel overly comfortable branding it as bluntly as that; there is good material present. The cast is actually quite good, and however much some dialogue feels clunky or unrealistic, they're almost able to deliver their lines competently. Not to mention that the second act is really good. The tone is shifted to where the movie turns into a cool thriller in which the characters are looking for answers. In many ways the Camera-work fits this idea for the story much better. this portion of the plot only shows that the overarching premise is really good and that the execution is whats sub par. Though at the same time, however good this is, talking about it does bring up tonal inconsistencies. The last good thing is that the plot is able to flow together consistently irregardless of the seconds acts departure in story type. Sadly the third act falls back into the trappings of the first act but with some different problems. I can actually determine the split second where it suddenly CUT(hint to where it was) and I was like ""oh! its back."". The actions of the main character feel rather careless and also dumb in the third act, along with rather poor lighting in the darker shot scenes and a really awkward fading edit at one point in the finale. So overall the omen is a weird thing that's hard to describe as a movie I could recommend. But it may be good for the sake of strange amusing interest alone. 3.666/10.I guess I just don't like this movie while others do. thats fine I guess.",The Omen

331,scotcarr,One of the best suspence movies ever. Period,9,19 April 2020,"Why does this movie still work? Simple - Richard Dinner & David Seltzer took a risk & cut all the ""horror"" tropes out of it. At its heart, it's plausible. Except for Billie Whitelaw, there's hardly a hint that Damien IS the Antichrist. All the mysterious deaths & happenstance surrounding him is played straight. Coincidence? A man's losing his mind? Satan's son unleashed on the world? Nary a hint one way or the other.Now, everything else about the movie truly serves it. Goldsmith's score is deliberately kept muted. While the cinematography feels like a Hammer Horror film, everything else is straight drama. And finally, the cast. They're all on point. Donner got top actors who knew the ambiguity & lunacy of their situation was key. About Billie Whitelaw? As I said, she's pretty much an acolyte. She does act more than a little sinister, but she still leaves a lot out. Is Mrs. Blaylock a Satanist? Is what we see of her malace really there, or is even a dillusion in Robert's head?While I consider the sequels - including the made-for-TV ""Omen: the Awakening"" - decent ""horror"" movies, that is precisely WHY they're not as powerful as this one. Almost all the subtilty here is gone. They are ""horror movies"". Better made & acted than most of their era, but horror they are. Even the virtually shot for shot ""remake"" in the early naughties, which I enjoyed very much, feels just empty when compared to the original. If you're stuck in the house w/your teenage kids & need something to entertain you as well as them, THIS is that kind of unorthodox ""family movie day/night"" choice.",The Omen
