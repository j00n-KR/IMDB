0,TheLittleSongbird,"Runs out of ideas, but not as bad as its rep",6,5 June 2011,"This is not the worst movie of 2006 as I have heard it often cited, Little Man and Date Movie are much worse. But it is no Pan's Labyrinth or Children of Men either, nor did it need to be. Instead it is a flawed but reasonably entertaining film. It is predictable in the story yes, it runs out of ideas at the end(didn't like the freeze frame for example) and the script and characters in a sense are clichéd. However, the film does look good with striking locations and fashions and the photography is above adequate. The soundtrack is bright and breezy, the pace is snappy and there are some amusing situations. Plus the entire cast are likable and do give it their all, while she has been better(ie. Mean Girls and Freaky Friday) Lindsay Lohan is very charming. All in all, not that bad in my opinion. 6/10 Bethany Cox",Just My Luck
1,SnoopyStyle,Lindsay Lohan too annoying,4,14 January 2014,"Ashley Albright (Lindsay Lohan) is a lucky girl in everything. On the other hand, Jake Hardin (Chris Pine) is the completely unlucky manager of a band, and a janitor in a bowling alley. Then they kiss and their luck switches.This has some possibilities as a rom-com concept, but Lindsay Lohan is just so annoying in the beginning. This movie is about transition, and it's incredible to realize that Lohan did 'Mean Girls' just two years before. I don't know the exact point where Lohan changed from a likable sweet teen into an annoying brat. But this is a big low point in her transition. The fix is simple. She just can't be the clueless princess in the beginning. It's too on the nose, and I can't pull for her.",Just My Luck
2,claudio_carvalho,"Silly, But Entertaining",6,8 July 2007,"In Manhattan, Ashley Albright (Lindsay Lohan) is a lucky woman and very successful in the agency where she works. The clumsy Jake Hardin (Chris Pine) is an unlucky aspirant manager of the rock band McFly, who is unsuccessfully trying to contact the entrepreneur Damon Phillips (Faizon Love) to promote his band. When Ashley meets Jake in a masquerade party, they kiss each other, swapping her fortune with his bad luck.""Just My Luck"" is a very silly and predictable comedy, but also entertaining. Lindsay Lohan is charming and adorable as usual and shows a good chemistry with Chris Pine making this movie work. Further, the story has no villain and all the characters are nice. Forget the private life of Linday in the tabloids and enjoy 103 minutes of fun in this forgettable fell-good movie. My vote is six.Title (Brazil): ""Sorte no Amor"" (""Luck in Love"")",Just My Luck
3,jboothmillard,Just My Luck,3,5 June 2011,"I had heard about this film a couple of times, obviously mainly because of the leading actress starring, and I was interested to see why the critics gave it a low rating, from director Donald Petrie (Mystic Pizza, Miss Congeniality, How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days). Basically in Manhattan, New York, socialite and agency worker Ashley Albright (twice Razzie nominated Lindsay Lohan) seems to be the luckiest woman in the city (if not the world), who has success in her work, her social life and on scratch cards. Jake Hardin (Chris Pine) is completely the opposite of lucky, he is clumsy, noticed for the wrong reasons and failing to get anywhere managing his band from the UK, McFly (Tom Fletcher, Danny Jones, Harry Judd and Dougie Poynter as themselves). Their fortunes are due to change the night when they both attend a masquerade ball and in the spur of the moment, while he is masked, they share a kiss, and they seem to have switched their span of luck. So now Ashley has turned into the most unlucky woman ever, crossing paths with a black cat, smashing a mirror, dropping a hair dryer in the bath and much more disaster besides, while Jake has managed to get entrepreneur Damon Phillips (Faizon Love) to promote his band. Ashley is sure that the kiss was the cause for her sudden span of bad luck, so she is determined to find the man who kissed her and gain her original state back. She tries many guys she knows attended the ball, but kissing every one of them hasn't worked, and she she does inadvertently find Jake she doesn't have a clue he is the one, she enjoys his company. Eventually she does find out he has stolen her good luck, but knowing he is having the success he always wanted getting McFly their big break she cannot force herself to kiss him. However she does decide in a desperate move to kiss him, and of course her good luck is indeed restored so that she can gain back the good things in life, but her guilt comes back to haunt her. She shows up for the big gig McFly are putting on, and she helps Jake and the night go on with success, and in the end they form a way to both have not great luck, but maybe things will pick up for them together. Also starring Charlie and the Chocolate Factory's Missi Pyle as Peggy Braden, Bree Turner as Dana, Samaire Armstrong as Maggie, Tovah Feldshuh as Madame Z, Carlos Ponce as Antonio and Makenzie Vega as Katy. Lohan is reasonably good as the spoilt and suddenly humiliated and disastrous girl, and Pine is okay as the guy she will fall for, and McFly are fun to watch and hear with songs like ""Five Colours In Her Hair"" and ""I'll OK"", there are moments where the over the top bad luck disasters are amusing, but they could be equally be irritating, so it is a slightly disappointing romantic comedy. Adequate!",Just My Luck
4,michaelRokeefe,The luckiest girl in town is also the hottest.,6,19 July 2007,"Star-crossed romantic comedy. Lindsay Lohan is Ashley Albright, the luckiest girl in New York City. A great career and living the high life. Jake Hardin(Chris Pine)happens to be the unluckiest guy in all of Manhattan. Mishap and misfortune are his middle names. Their lives change when they meet at a swanky masquerade party and share a kiss. Just a kiss...Ashley turns into a bad luck magnet and Jake is soon headed for his fame and fortune guiding a young rock group McFly. Ashley desperately wants to change her fate, but must find Jake to steal her luck back. Also in the cast: Missi Pyle, Faizone Love, Samaire Armstrong, Bree Turner, Carlos Ponce and the band McFly. An upbeat soundtrack keeps the flick in the groove with tunes from Jo Boxers, Chantal Kreviazuk, Robert Palmer and of course McFly. This movie may seem a bit cutsie to most, but Miss Lohan and McFly make it worth watching.",Just My Luck
5,hitchcockthelegend,Just got lucky.,6,4 November 2010,"Just My Luck is directed by by Donald Petrie and written by I. Marlene King and Amy B. Harris. It stars Lindsay Lohan and Chris Pine. Plot sees Lohan as Ashley, the luckiest girl in New York, who after kissing Jake (Pine,) the unluckiest man in New York, loses her luck to him.Yeah it's pretty thin as a concept goes, two people, one lucky, the other not so, meet and their fortunes drastically change. Cue much larkery as Lohan's it girl suffers wave after wave of accidents while Pine becomes a big mover in the music world after discovering Brit guitar band McFly. The cynical amongst us would say this is just an excuse to promote McFly in America, but if one sets expectation level at medium then Just My Luck has enough romantic comedy froth to not waste the time of the undemanding viewer. Pine and Lohan actually make for an adorable couple, but sadly the romance is under developed by the writers and the culmination of their coupling is badly rushed. The comedy set-pieces are handled well enough, while McFly themselves have enough boyish charm to not let the ""hard sell"" get annoying.Far from breathing new life into yet another role reversal comedy, Just My Luck is still, thanks largely to its two leads, engaging enough while it lasts. 6/10",Just My Luck
6,anaconda-40658,Just My Luck That I Sat Through This Junk.,3,10 June 2015,"Just My Luck (2006): Dir: Donald Petrie / Cast: Lindsay Lohan, Chris Pine, Samaire Armstrong, Missi Pyle, Faizon Love: As with Freaky Friday, Lindsay Lohan stars in another dimwitted plot centering around magic only instead of a fortune cookie, it is a kiss this time. It is a comedy about coincidence starring lucky Lohan and unlucky Chris Pine. They meet at a party, share a kiss and suddenly he is successful and ends up promoting McFly, a band that has trusted him with little luck. Lohan loses her job, ends up in jail twice, and goes face first in art that resembles elephant dung. The magic aspect is unexplained and reduces the formula driven story to corny mishaps. Director Donald Petrie previously made The Associate and the overrated Miss Congeniality as well as the terrible My Favorite Martian. This isn't exactly moving upward in his career. Lohan is funnier than the material deserves but she is still at the mercy of lame storytelling. This is a big step down after her great comic performance in Mean Girls. Pine is also trudging in predictable idiocy. Supporting roles are flat including Samaire Armstrong as a friend of Lohan's and Missi Pyle as her boss. Despite its lack of magical explanation the film contains no magic of any kind. It could have examined superstitions but neglects so. Lohan fans expecting another Mean Girls are fresh out of luck. Score: 3 / 10",Just My Luck
7,DICK STEEL,A Nutshell Review: Just My Luck,5,17 June 2006,"The only Lindsay Lohan movie I had ever watched was Mean Girls (2004)  on board a flight to Europe, and I thought it was a pretty entertaining  chick flick. Herbie Fully Loaded somehow didn't appeal to me, so Just  My Luck was next on the screens here. There's another little story too  on how we picked this DVD in Petaling Jaya, KL, Malaysia, together with  Scary Movie 4, and then donated it, but heck, that's another story for  another day, and it really was just our luck that night of the  purchase.  Just My Luck tells the story of the crossing of fated paths between an  incredibly lucky girl, and a totally unlucky guy. In typical  boy-meets-girl fashion, these 2 individuals will meet, and re-meet each  other again in make-believably coincidental situations, and find in  each other, the sparks of love. The introduction was quite neat, as we  get acquainted with Ashley Albright (Lindsay Lohan), the walking good  luck charm, and Jake Hardin (Chris Pine), a walking disaster with a  knapsack full of emergency supplies to help him tide through the day.  One's a sassy PR consultant, the other a ""bao-kar-liao"" (takes care of  everything) lowly worker  at a bowler's, aspiring to make it  big via his discovery of a Brit band, the McFlys. The couple meet  anonymously at a masquerade ball, and a seemingly innocent kiss  transfers all the luck on Ashley, to Chris. And so it follows that  Ashley will try everything she can to get her luck back. Until her  conscience starts to question just who might need the luck more.  The reversal of roles story isn't really new, only the medium and  method are different. Like recent movies The Shaggy Dog, and even  Lohan's own Freaky Friday, are movies that belong to the same story  genre. So the question is, does this one work? Given the good looking  cast, it should appeal to the youngsters who are fans of Lohan, or are  attracted to the good looks of Chris Pine. Their chemistry worked well  off each other, and you can feel their respective surprise and  frustration as their lifestyles differ drastically.  There are plenty of situational comedy infused with a story like this,  but most of them felt contrived. Towards the end, given that luck could  swing the situation either way, some scenes seemed to be stuck in limbo  way too long, waiting for that punchline to give it direction. Granted,  being incredibly lucky already is stretching the plot a bit too thinly,  so you'll be better off treating this movie like a childish fantasy. A  typical date-safe movie enjoyable at certain points though, with the  usual expected feel-good ending.",Just My Luck
8,namashi_1,Simple & Sweet!,6,19 March 2015,"'Just My Luck' is a simple & sweet rom-com, that passes of as a pleasant one-time watch. 'Just My Luck' Synopsis: Manhattanite Ashley is known to many as the luckiest woman around. After a chance encounter with a down-and-out young man, however, she realizes that she's swapped her fortune for his.'Just My Luck' works due to its funny Screenplay & Lindsay Lohan's goofy performance. I. Marlene King & Amy B. Harris's Screenplay makes good use of its interesting premise, and many moments succeed in making you laugh. Of course, its not sharp, but for the genre it follows, its decently written. But its Lohan, who's responsible for the film's funniest bits. She's in good form, particularly in the comedic portions, not once going over-the-top. She also gets fine support from a nicely restrained Chris Pine, who manages to leave a mark, despite the fact, that this is Lohan's show. On the whole, 'Just My Luck' isn't a bad way to spend a lazy Sunday afternoon.",Just My Luck
9,Smells_Like_Cheese,"Not something I'd watch again, but I don't regret watching it",5,12 September 2006,"Seriously people, I thought that this was an honest, funny, and cute movie. The plot is a bit lame, of course, I mean what were you expecting from a Lindsay Lohan movie? But still, I thought that it was just a fun little flick to watch. I loved having fun with my friends when we watched it because we were coming up with ideas on how Lindsay and this guy could still be together and how they'd have to have a chart and take turns with the luck.Maybe that's why I enjoyed it so much. But as a movie, yeah, it was a little lame. There were still a lot of funny and cute scenes, like when Lindsay looses her luck and she has to work as a janitor at her crush's old job. Her working in the high heels was so funny. I guess because I'm a girl and could relate to it. So, give this movie a chance, it really isn't that bad. If you are looking for it to be bad, than don't watch it.5/10",Just My Luck

11,Robert_duder,"Light, fluffy, and not entirely unfortunate",7,21 May 2006,"Just My Luck is not presumptuous. It doesn't try to be anything that it's not. It's a VERY typical, magical romantic comedy along the same lines as Freaky Friday, Simply Irresistible, or even Just Like Heaven. It never strays from it's typical recipe and doesn't try to be anything but. Although many have described this as Lohan's first attempt at an ""adult role"" I disagree whole heartedly. Although Lohan doesn't play a high school student the film is still entirely adolescent and doesn't have an adult bone in it's body. It's still fluffy, low brow humor and Lohan unfortunately doesn't have the energy she usually does to really pull it off.Lindsay Lohan is a star, I'm not going to argue with anyone about it. She has amazing screen presence, she's the ultimate girl next door, and plenty of personality. It seems as though her apparently diverse personal life which peaked during the filming of this film with partying and such effected her performance because the personality we all know was toned down significantly. Nonetheless her performance is good. The role is an actual adult and she does it well enough. It's also full of comedic one liners and physical comedy which I also think she does well just not with her usual flare. Still the film works for her. The rest of the cast is really where the film pulls together. Chris Pine is terrific as the accident and bad-luck proned Jake Hardin, who suddenly has a change of luck after kissing a mysterious woman (Lohan) and taking her good luck. Pine is very down to earth, a great match for Lohan and they have really, really good chemistry. He's a nice guy that's easy to like and he fits the role well. Even if the film doesn't do well this role should do well for him. The hidden star performances I thought were by Lohan's best friends and makeshift room mates. Samaire Armstrong (who many of us know as smarter than the rest Anna from The O.C.) does a terrific job as shy, nervous, but as usual full of advice, Maggie. Her subtle performance adds the little bit of intelligence to the cast and performs more than average. She might have even been able to pull off the lead. Also as good but shares less screen time is her other best friend Dana played by Bree Turner. The three of them make a great combo and Armstrong and Turner share screen time with Lohan very well without looking out of place. They are well done!! Missi Pyle does a good job as Lohan's boss Peggy Braden, and the small role of Antonio is very funny played by Carlos Ponce.The very predictable story is completely saved by the decent and well acted cast. It never really was a laugh out loud kind of film although at times it tried to be but everything was far too subtle. Considering some of director Donald Petrie's previous work Just My Luck might not seem up to his caliber. He has done some really incredible comedies but nonetheless the film works and it's not bad. It's worth a nice little date night or perhaps a fluffy little rent when it comes out. It's definitely not bad at all. 7/10",Just My Luck
12,MLDinTN,luck to the nth degree,5,26 March 2007,"This movie was OK. Kids will probably like it more since it is so unrealistic in parts and stars teen queen L.L. L.L. plays Ashley who has the most amazing luck until she looses it to a guy who has the worst luck by a kiss. Now she must find who she kissed and get her luck back. Will she discover she doesn't really need the luck after all? There were some funny moments but it was all rather silly. It was almost like slap stick comedy. She has bad luck so breaks things, falls down, ie... When someone falls in a mud sculpture, it's got to be bad luck. And L.L. was not so annoying for once.FINAL VERDICT: If you like silly comedies, you may find it entertaining enough to watch.",Just My Luck
13,inkblot11,Lucky is the day you sit down to enjoy this film!,7,8 June 2006,"Ashley (Lindsay Lohan) is a young supporting player at an advertising agency. One day, most of the management gets stuck in an elevator and its up to Ashley to pitch a plan to a major recording executive. He hears and he likes. Suddenly, Ashley is moving up in the company. But, its not just that. She seems to banish the rain from falling, hails cabs with a snap of her fingers and, in general, looks fabulous and leads a very fortunate life. That is, until she kisses a mysterious but attractive stranger at the big company bash she organized. All of sudden, her luck goes so bad that her apartment floods and she is on her way to working at a bowling alley. How could this be? And, is there no way to change this reversal of fortune? Darling, just darling, that's what this movie is. Lohan is a dear as the who lives a charmed life that suddenly flies out the window. All of the supporting players are winning, also, especially Chris Pine, the love interest. The story and script shine with cleverness and originality and, oh, the costumes are quite fetching and flattering as well. Yes, this is probably the perfect film for a tween age slumber party. But, that does not mean it should be overlooked. Females everywhere will bask in the pleasures of this film and, gosh darn it, they should just make their partners watch it with them. After all, how many action movies do caring females sit through (and enjoy) while holding hands with their honeys, huh? Just make sure you don't miss this film. A good, happy feeling will permeate through the heart of anyone who views it.",Just My Luck
14,tabuno,A Step Up Romantic Comedy,8,18 January 2019,"15 August 2010. Chris Pine who would be the new Captain Kirk in Star Trek (2009) and Lindsay Lohan, yes that one, get together with a kiss in this romantic comedy that is deliberate and takes its time to set up the characters and their current life and then with good pacing proceeds to reveal the turmoils whereby a lucky Lohan accidentally transfers her luck to the unlucky Pine. What comes next is a decently in some ways underplayed comedy that avoids the completely outlandish but it retains plenty of sight gags and problems that entertain. Yet by the end of this mostly predictable movie, it still retains its integrity with a decent character plot outline that keeps the substantive lines going a bit longer than most juvenile comedies.",Just My Luck
15,insomniac_rod,Delivers (low) expectations.,5,10 February 2008,"Well you can't expect something interesting with a movie with a cover like that! Seriously...Now, as a movie oriented for teens who enjoy pink toned stories, it isn't that bad. I had the chance to watch this while traveling so I didn't have many options to decide whether to watch it or not.The plot is simple and easy to follow and I won't get into details because I think the summary on IMDb is very clear.There are some things that I didn't think were real enough or enough to give young people a message. For example, Lohan's character lives on an expensive apartment and dresses with expensive clothing while his job is not that ""important"". I guess that her hotness raises her salary. And I'm thrilled to see how important she is for her boss and the staff.Anyways, the movie has a decent climax on a dance and things get fixed over there. Overall it's a mildly entertaining movie exclusively for Lohan's fans or teenagers who want a fresh but clichéd comedy.I was a neutral viewer so I can't say I didn't like or dislike it. Anyways I decided to give it a try and I can only say that it's a movie you should only watch if it airs on cable very, very late.",Just My Luck
16,lisafordeay,Just so stupid,1,6 October 2010,"I got this on DVD a few years ago and I no longer own it because I hated this film and heres why.Just my Luck is a romantic comedy about a spoilt brat named Ashley Allbright(Lindsay Lohan)who has it all a great career and a great life as she has good luck,meanwhile a nerdy guy named Jake (Chris Pine)is an out of his luck guy who dreams of becoming a music manager for McFly(who feature in this movie).So when Ashley has a masquerade bash for her career she meets Jake and they dance but when they kiss they magically swap their fortunes. Jake now has good luck as he rescued some music manager who nearly got killed as some taxi came by and he saved him and he even has a nice flat. Ashley on the other hand has the bad luck and she nearly gets electrocuted twice and she goes to jail a few times to.What I really don't like about this film is that its unrealistic and not original at all. Its like watching freaky Friday over and over again. Lindsay Lohan's movie career was on a meltdown when she starred in this silly Rom com. Chris Pine was a hottie I thought he was great eye candy.The ending to this was plain stupid I mean she cries kisses him and then they have the same luck. How stupid was that so if I kissed a guy and he had bad luck i'd get half of it.Don't waste your time or money on this crap its so boring.0 stars.",Just My Luck
17,mattkratz,not bad,8,10 January 2008,"If you have a little time to kill, I recommend this movie. It is a good vehicle for Lindsay Lohan, who plays perhaps the luckiest lady in New York City. Chris Pine plays a guy who is perhaps the unluckiest man in the town. Everything goes wrong for him. When they meet at a costume ball and he kisses her, their fortunes get swapped. What happens next is hilarity and chaos as Lohan tries to figure out what has happened to her and reverse her sudden swarm of disasters. The disasters that befall her are marvelously done. I think this movie was funny and good. You will like it if you see it.** 1/2 out of ****",Just My Luck

Anyways it wasn't half bad; cute, mindless, entertainment. Lindsay Lohan was actually decent here, present, well dressed and amusing with her silly physical gags as she goes from lucky, polished career gal to blundering bowling alley janitor, after her good fortune is reversed when she kisses the unluckiest guy in N.Y at a masked ball.I enjoyed Chris Pine here too, he doesn't stretch himself too far in terms of acting and just plays a nice guy. There are some amusing secondary stories and characters; Ashley's gal pals set up a sort of 'Sex and The City' vibe, the rich music producer, a male prostitute neighbour and a young girl that 'Jake' looks out for.The British boy band Mcfly was overused in my opinion but others seem to have liked them and their music. This is clearly aimed at a young adult audience, there aren't any sex scenes, no profanity, nothing blows up, its just a cute easy story. 4/25/15",Just My Luck

20,triple8,cute flick that got a much worse rap then it deserved.,6,7 January 2007,"SPOILERS: This wasn't a bad movie at all. I like movies with this type of premise and the movie itself made a cute watch. It's not going to land an Oscar but one could do worse then this.Just because a movie maybe cutesy or unoriginal or predictable doesn't always mean it's bad. This movie happens to be all of the above but it still has a fun quality and that's probably because the two main leads are very likable and have enormous chemistry(way more then one would think in a movie like this). The initial meeting between them at the masquerade party was done well and had a touch of mystery. Later, when they strike up a friendship it is developed really well and seems believable. The transformations of each of them, when having luck and losing it, are interesting if painful. Plus you get to like both main characters and do kind of wonder how the movie will resolve as you want both characters to come out of it OK, with their luck intact. I will say I did like the way it was resolved.I was occasionally reminded of both ""Freaky Friday"" and ""Prelude to a kiss"". Most of all, I think the movie worked because the two main characters were both likable and relateable. Who hasn't felt the highs and lows of these two at different points in one's life? I think this movie did pretty bad at the box office but I caught it by chance and didn't find it half bad though it's not a must see. But if one digs the premise and is a Lohan fan, they could do worse then to check this whimsical little flick out. My vote's 6.5",Just My Luck
21,michaeltrivedi,Alright Lohan Movie,3,30 November 2019,There's nothing great about this movie. All I could say is that it's alright. It's a cool movie. Lohan does well as the popular type.

22,aesgaard41,Vintage Lohan,10,20 June 2007,"I'm very well of the fact that some people are lucky and some people are predisposed to bad luck because everything I've touched tends to blow up in my face. This movie is pure classic Lindsay Lohan; like all her movies, she exudes a wonderful charming presence far beyond her image as just another tabloid sex symbol. In this movie, she is cute, charming, funny and incredibly adorable as a girl who has lived her life skated on nothing but good fortune just to lose it all to Chris Pine, a decent guy with a streak of bad luck. My favorite part is when Lindsay goes through town kissing strange dancers trying to get her good luck back; I've got a name for those guys, lucky b*******. Both Lindsay and Chris compliment each other very well in this movie, the McFly music group is actually good enough to be a real band if they aren't already and the script and comedy flow along very well without stalling or dragging. Over all, it's a charming romantic comedy with a mild fantasy element much better than the bad reviews skewering it. This is one movie definitely making my DVD collection.",Just My Luck

24,Mr_Sensitive,People Pigeonhole This As Bad Movie Just To Make Their Taste Look Good,6,20 March 2007,"Actually I thought it was quite entertaining. Good for what it is, a silly pre teen comedy movie. And if you take it seriously then you definitely pick the wrong movie to watch. I think the movie was bash because of Lindsey Lohan bad publicity.Synopsis: Ashley has luck on her side; Jack is opposite. One day at the mask party they both kiss and swap their luck. Ashley finally found herself in the situation she have never been and take out on the mission to get her luck back by trying to kiss every guy on the party list.I can't deny it but this was like a combination of Freaky Friday and Confession of Teenage Drama Queen. So the story might not be original and to the extent very cliché and predictable but it was present enough if one enjoys this type of commercial movie.What seem to be the highlight point of this movie was the cast, without Lindsey this movie wouldn't get this much publicity and without Lindsey it wouldn't get this much bash from people. Otherwise there is Chris Pine, Samaire, Bree, McFly Band that did pretty OK job. Nice wardroom, pretty good location and everything seem nice and clean.Overall it has most the stuff preteen movie looking hot guys, rock band, love story, hot girls, crazy situation, and so on. And it was pretty all-right film. It surely doesn't deserve this much bashing.

It's a good date movie for those 16 year old boys who want to impress their new 14 year old girlfriends.Anybody older should maybe look for something a little less Lindsay.Because don't you know it...all spunky red haired, blue eyed, perky smiley face girls live in a $4000 a month penthouse, work in a well to do advertising/pr firm and make the deal of the decade before they even reach 25 years old and never have to struggle.Even her friends live in nice apartments in New York City...far from the deep violent suburbs of the Bronx or Queens or Brooklyn...and all under the ages of 25...ain't that a surprise!How dare anybody in New York City under 25 ever live in an apartment that doesn't cost less than $3000 a month? It would be so unfair to them...And don't you know it...every apartment overlooks the river or Central Park and has a doorman and posh furniture.F*CK ME...I wish I was a 21 year old girl in NYC...my life would be made.Oops, but sadly...I am not Lindsay.I guess I'll have to go back to my real world life and pay bills, wash dishes in a semi dirty kitchen and ride public transit while actually having to go to work in a real job where a smile and wave just doesn't cut the task.When you want to escape from real life...watch a Lindsay Lohan movie and help her earn $15 million dollars a movie...When you want real entertainment...watch something without her.Until then - keep living the Lindsay dream.",Just My Luck
26,richieandsam,Average at best,6,22 December 2012,"JUST MY LUCK.I watched this on the TV, and I am happy I didn't pay to see it.It was OK, but nothing special.It is a romantic comedy about a girl who always has really good luck and a guy who has really bad luck all the time, but when they kiss their luck swaps around.It has got Lindsay Lohan and Chris Pine in. I am not a big Lohan fan and I have only seen Chris Pine in Star Trek. They did OK, but there were a few scenes it it where the acting was terrible. Also, the script was over the top puke at times. I know you need mushy conversations in a romantic film, but this was too much even for a romcom.There were quite a few funny moments though. It generally was a funny film. I was entertained while it was on, but I won't be watching it again.There were scenes where Lindsay had some bad luck, and the way she tries to hide it or fix it just would not happen.The director of this film also directed How To Lose A Guy In 10 Days... I liked that, but this was not great.I will give this film a 6 out of 10.I have seen a lot better.For more normal reviews, please like my Facebook page.http://www.facebook.com/pages/Ordinary-Person-Movie- Reviews/456572047728204?ref=hl",Just My Luck
27,wrlang,cute and clean,7,10 October 2006,"Just My Luck is about a girl (Lohan) that has all the luck in the world and doesn't realize it until she loses it during a kiss with a real klutzy guy (Pine) who then puts that luck it to good use getting his buddies in McFly onto the stage. Most of the film Lohan is trying to find the guy she lost her luck to and when she finally does, she doesn't know whether to take the luck back or leave it with the guy. A film for just about the whole family, there is very little for the moral majority to get up tight about. Good music by McFly and good acting bring a fresh happy story to the screen.

28,christian123,Lindsay Lohan can't save this piece of trash,3,1 September 2006,"Ashley Albright (Lindsay Lohan), the luckiest woman in the world with a great job and everything going her way, meets Jake (Chris Pine), a chronic loser, at a costume party, but when they kiss, his bad luck is transferred to her and vice versa. Suddenly, Ashley's life isn't going so well, and she needs to find Jake and try to get her luck back from him.Just My Luck is a dreadful, unfunny, predictable and weak romantic comedy. It's supposed to be light entertainment yet it offers absolutely nothing to the viewer. I usually like Lindsay Lohan's movies like Mean Girls and Freaky Friday. Lately though, her choices for scripts have been less than stellar. Herbie: Fully Loaded was a bust and Just My Luck is even worse. First, the film was really cheesy and not in a good way. There were so many stupid moments even for this type of movie. The script was just a collection of lame jokes that didn't work out very well. Also, most of the bad luck that happened to the characters could have easily been avoided. Most of it was just their own stupidity and no amount of good luck can fix that. The movie was also highly unbelievable which was expected. For example, the main character has to be around 22 yet she is able to live in this expensive New York apartment by herself.The acting was pretty weak and no one really stood out. Lindsay Lohan is a pretty good actress, showing a lot of soul in Mean Girls and Freaky Friday. Unfortunately, her performance here was quite bland. It wasn't bad just not very interesting. Her character was also pretty annoying and unlikable. Chris Pine played her love interest and he gave an okay performance. His character was more likable yet also kind of bland. There was no chemistry between Lindsay and Chris and this ruined the film. It was hard to root for these characters when they really showed no interest in one another. Missi Pyle gave the only funny performance but she was in the movie for about fifteen minutes. Samaire Armstrong, Bree Turner and Makenzie Vega all had supporting roles and they played them decently without really putting in a lot of effort.The worst thing about Just My Luck was the band McFly. Their music was featured throughout the entire movie and it was such a pain to listen to them. Sometimes, the film felt like a cheap commercial for the band and they even got their own subplot. None of them were interesting either and I have trouble believing that they will make it. Director Donald Petrie should be blamed for this trash. He kept the movie safe and he added nothing remarkable to it. Hopefully, Lohan's next movie will be much better and she can put this mess behind her. In the end, Just My Luck is a horrible film and it's worth skipping. Rating 3/10",Just My Luck

30,badajoz-1,Passes the time - just,4,17 December 2012,"As usual, a US movie that is a romcom, but really is about REDEMPTION - and Lindsay Lohan at that! Plot shows a couple obviously meant for each other (Lindsay Lohan and a very young Chris Pine) - one has lots of luck and the other has none - who exchange their fortunes when they kiss. Cue 'Sex and the City' braindead clotheshorse finds herself in jail, getting splattered with rain and mud etc while male discovers new pop group - 'McFly.' There are some good sight gags but audio is poor as actors gabble, and the situation goes from cliché to cliché. unfortunately Lohan is neither sexy/pretty enough or a good enough actress to carry this fluff, but Pine shows a good flair for comedy, which has not been properly exploited yet - oh, and hasn't he buffed up since this was made!",Just My Luck

This is a well-paced old-fashioned comedy-fantasy that is true to itself within its context. Chris Pine is very cute as the boy for whom nothing goes right until he kisses Lindsay Lohan. The latter's array of friends are consistent, convincing, and provide good support throughout. McFly is hilarious throughout and keeps the surreal subtext needed for a good comedy-fantasy going throughout. The little girl playing Pine's niece steals every scene she is in and is crucial to the finale which involves several clever plot twists neatly pieced together. A great movie? No. But, it's not supposed to be. A fun way to spend an hour and a half? absolutely.",Just My Luck

All this will change the day they meet in a party, and they kiss each other, as they change their luck and the situation becomes inverted, which will lead to very funny (theorically) situations. The plot is very typical, with anything new; most of the scenes are very seen and are filmed with poor art. Actors are not much better and most of the time they just seem too much stupid. Most of the gags are not funny and if you want to watch good art or to laugh a lot you'll be totally disappointed.

33,ScottDMenzel,"""Just My Luck"" is oddly enough a surprisingly good film about love, life and luck.",7,12 May 2006,"Ashley (Lindsay Lohan) has the perfect life. She is a big shot public relations person at one of New York City's biggest firms. She's pretty, classy, clever and seems to always have lady luck on her side. But that is about to change when Ashley meets Jake (Chris Pine) a nice guy who just cant seem to catch a break. Ashley and Jake meet at a masquerade ball which Ashley is in charge of the throwing for a billion dollar client and if all goes as planned, she will become vice president of her firm. But a simple innocent little kiss is about to change her luck. A pleasantly funny and interesting movie ensues I really liked ""Just My Luck"" and I have a couple of reasons for it. While many will say that this film is very silly which I do agree with to a point, there is much more to it then just its silliness. I think if people actually took time to read through the lines with this film, they would be able to see another movie. Yes, it's a romantic comedy but it is much more than that. It's a movie about luck and realizing that if you want something bad enough, one day it will happen. On the surface, this seems like just a no-brainier romantic comedy but if you look it at from the very beginning to the very end and actually think about this film, you can see this film in a different light then what most people see. ""Just My Luck"" is a film that is all in the eye of the beholder.I also liked the fact that they made Ashley and Jake complete opposites which kind of added a nice little subplot of opposites attract to the film. I also like that the director didn't make the film seem unbelievable with the characters and their lifestyles Ashley was basically a successful business woman and Jake was just a guy who wanted to get a job as a music producer but never could catch a break. The story has believable and realistic characters that are sometimes put through unrealistic circumstances but it's a Hollywood made film so you can't expect it to be perfect.What I think the film did best was show exactly how the idea of luck runs people lives. There are so many people in life that feel that they are the luckiest people on the planet and there are some that think they are the most unlucky people on the planet. This film shows both worlds and how in just a moment that all can change. Many will think its about Ashley being lucky and Jake being unlucky but it's really not about that it's about how we go through our lives and one day out of no where everything changes for better or worse and this film just shows it can happen by meeting the right person which of course is only one of the many things that can change your life forever.I like Lindsay Lohan and always have. I know she's not the world's greatest actress but she tries and does a decent job at everything she does. What that being said, I really have to say I feel ""Just My Luck"" is the best film she has ever done. I think ""Just My Luck"" is a little more grown up than her normal work and allows her to play a more adultish character. I couldn't help but think her character was one of the women from ""Sex and the City"" and there were several jokes in the film that confirmed that idea. I like to see Lindsay do more films like this and I really look forward to seeing how she does in the upcoming Robert Altman film ""A Prairie Home Companion"" which is an independent film that should have a very strong story and well developed characters. Other than Lohan, Chris Pine did a great job playing her opposite in the film. He was a very likable and nice character. I liked that he didn't make his character out to be too dorky or too macho. He was actually a really ""normal"" guy and I liked that about his character and how he played it.""Just My Luck"" was directed by Donald Petrie who has had his fair share of ups and downs when it comes to directing films. Petrie's last big hit was ""How to Lose A Guy"" which I will admit was a very unique romantic comedy that I enjoyed very much. ""Just My Luck"" is nothing like that film except for it being a romantic comedy. I really think Petrie knows how to make a decent film as long as he has a good script to work with. I think Petrie captured these characters and their frustrations very well.In the end, I really liked ""Just My Luck."" Sure it wasn't a groundbreaking film or a film that was very powerful and moving but it was an entertaining film that if you looked under the surface you would see a much more meaningful film. I think its Lohan's best performance to date and I think the film is actually one of director Donald Petrie's best films to date as well. It's a fun romantic comedy that both guys and girls alike can enjoy. I know it will be going into my DVD collection when it hits DVD shelves.MovieManMenzel's final rating for ""Just My Luck"" is a 7/10; an enjoyable and entertaining twist on the romantic comedy genre",Just My Luck
34,blacklist-1,Good fluffy entertainment.,5,20 April 2010,"This really is a chick-flick movie compared to other rom-coms I have seen and is more sugary and sentimental than most, but that dosen't make it bad. Lindsay Lohan plays Ashley who is known as the luckiest woman around, but after a chance encounter with Jake played by Chris Pine she realises her fortune of luck has switched with his.This is very predictable with the outcome at the end with a cliché plot and cheesy dialogue making the film silly but the two main leads act well and are charming and cute. In terms of that you actually route for the two to get together and laugh at the silliness of it all. This is nothing special at all but I think the very low ratings are a bit harsh.

Not one moment of spontaneity or surprise.

At times, it gets so ridiculous, it's actually a pain to watch.It's an entirely unremarkable movie -- I didn't remember ANYTHING from it the next day.

While as pointed out, this wont win any awards, it has its quirky moments, which were rarely funny but were well choreographed and the whole bad luck/.good luck theme and the idea it can be switched was an interesting idea that was played out well in the film. Faizon Love stole the show as the always pressed for time moneybags record producer and it helped that the band could play and are musicians in their own right.

37,Robert_Hearth,"""Jake Is The Guy I Kissed At The Masquerade Bash."" --- Ashley Albright (Lindsay Lohan)",6,8 October 2006,"""Just My Luck"" (2006) Directed By: Donald Petrie Starring: Lindsay Lohan, Chris Pine, Samaire Armstrong, Bree Turner, Missi Pyle, & Faizon Love MPAA Rating: ""PG-13"" (for some brief sexual references) Lindsay Lohan burst onto the screen in 1998 playing a dual-role as twins in the smash-hit comedy remake, ""The Parent Trap"". She then went on to star in many teen comedies, including ""Freaky Friday"" and ""Confessions of a Teenage Drama Queen"". ""Just My Luck"" was supposed to mark Lohan's first venture into more adult-oriented comedies. Well, if this was supposed to be the start of a new branch of Lohan's career, then it is safe to say that her career will remain fairly stagnant for the next few years, as there is very little difference between this or any other Lohan film that came before this. The plot is reminiscent of that of ""Freaky Friday"", except not quite as interesting. In fact, this would appear to be the most typical, clichéd film that Lohan has ever done and it follows the formula of a teen comedy so closely that it rarely, if ever, expands to become anything more. In all honesty, this is a step backwards for Lohan, after the impressive ""Mean Girls"", which sported more risqué humor and a stronger rating. If Lohan thinks that this is the type of movie she needs to make to become a respected adult actress, then she seriously needs to reconsider her career. The types of movie that will advance her career away from these typical teen are movies like ""The Prairie Home Companion"", not movies like ""Just My Luck"". Ashley Albright (Lohan) has the best luck in the world. She has an amazing career that is only getting better and better and always wins with scratch-off lottery tickets. The rain stops when she steps outside and her life is always happy. Jake Hardin (Pine), on the other hand, has the worst luck in the world. The rain seems to fall harder when he steps outside and his career is going nowhere fast. Ashley is assigned to throw a fabulous masquerade party for all of Manhattan's elite and Jake crashes the party in order to give a demo CD of a band he is promoting to a hot-shot music producer. The two meet by chance and Ashley decides to have a little fun with him. They begin to dance and the sparks fly. In a moment of passion, they kissand their luck reverses. Now, everything seems to be going wrong for Ashley and everything is going right for Jake. Now, Ashley, with the help of her friends, Maggie (Armstrong) and Dana (Turner), must track down Jake so that Ashley can kiss him again and retrieve her luck. But things do not go according to her plans, as she slowly falls herself falling in love with him for real and cannot bring herself to take away his good luck. Now, do you see what I am saying? This plot is strangely similar to that of ""Freaky Friday"" and is just like the teen comedies Lohan is supposedly trying to escape.The performances in ""Just My Luck"" are not Oscar-worthy, but they are perfectly suitable for this type of movie. Lindsay Lohan may be infamous for excessive partying and poor work ethic, but she is quite talented and displays her abilities well here. Chris Pine first hit the big screen in ""The Princess Diaries 2: The Royal Engagement"" and he has clearly not escaped these teen romantic comedy roles. That's unfortunate. Why is Samaire Armstrong in a supporting role in this film? Why is she even in this movie at all? She deserves, if nothing else, a leading role and in a movie that is better than this. Bree Turner has come a long way from the mediocre ""Bring It On Again"". Thank God. She is perfectly adequate here. I love Missi Pyle. She can do no wrong. I don't know why she wasted her time here, but she does a nice job anyway. Faizon Love convinced me almost completely, though his character was a shameless stereotype. The remainder of the cast did what they had to do with little trouble. No one really stood out, but they do their jobs.""Just My Luck"" is not a bad movie. It is just a typical movie. Everything comes together exactly as you would expect it to, making it less entertaining that it could have originally been. The pacing is less than satisfactory and I found myself reaching towards the fast-forward button more than once. For a film that is one hour and forty-three minutes in length, it should have been about fifteen minutes shorter. Everything seemed to be drawn-out just a little too long. The first thirty minutes are trying to show how lucky Ashley is and how unlucky Jake is. Halfway through, I found myself thinking, ""Okay, I get it. She's got a lot of luck and he doesn't. Move along already"". On a plus side, many of the jokes work beautifully and Lohan's performance elicits all of the right laughs in all of the right places. On an even better note, this movie is surprisingly low on cheese. It is still there, but just not nearly as prolific. In Roger Ebert's review of this film, he makes the most accurate statement I have read concerning this movie: ""Some movies make me feel like I'm someone else. Other movies make me wish I were. Watching 'Just My Luck,' I wished I were a teenage girl, not for any perverse reason but because then I might have enjoyed it a lot more"". Unlike Ebert (who gave it thumbs down), however, I recommended it for just this reason. Its target audience will love it, even though I found it to be just merely okay.Final Thought: ""Just My Luck"" is safe and harmless, but entertaining.Overall Rating: 6/10 (B)",Just My Luck
38,mcsheehey,Just My Disgust,1,6 June 2007,"""just My Luck,"" which claims to be a funny comedy about unfortunate people, is truly not. It is actually a stupid movie about stupid people who do stupid things. Lindsay Lohan plays Ashley, who holds some cutesy little job, lives in a cutesy little apartment, and wears cutesy little clothes all the time. She's unbelievably lucky at the start of the film, and everything seems to go right for her. In the opening scenes, she receives an exciting outfit in the mail sent by mistake, curries favor with her obnoxious boss, and gets the boss a date with her ""dashing"" neighbor. Suddenly though, at a masked ball, she kisses Jake, and incredibly unlucky guy, and their luck changes. Jake manages the band McFLY, and witnesses their breakthrough, while Ashley loses her job, dirties her precious clothes, and is arrested. Of course, after a while, she meets up with Jake again and the film's predictability continues, even into the last cheesy moments of the film.Lindsay Lohan plays her role in the most over-the-top manner possible, making the audience loathe her shrill and obnoxious character. Chris Pine is fine as Jake, but I didn't believe for on second that his and Lindsay's characters could ever get together in reality. The humor in the film is completely slapstick, and we've seen it all before. We ""get"" to see Lindsay fall down, Lindsay get all dirty, Lindsay get hit in the head with a wine cork, Lindsay get electrocuted, Lindsay have gum dropped on her, and Lindsay lose her apartment, among plenty of other stupid and cliché moments.The basic idea of the film, about lucky and unlucky people, is actually an interesting idea. I think a good film could have been made where the leading lady thinks she's lost her luck, when in reality she's simply become a self-fulfilling prophecy. Unfortunately, this film asks us to believe in the power of luck, and that it is actually real, which is ridiculous and stupid. This is a dumb film that has no reality factor at all in it, and it steals all of its slap-stick moments from other superior comedies. in the end, ""Just my Luck"" stinks. Period.1/10",Just My Luck

It is a combination of 'Freaky Friday' and 'Confessions of a Teenage Drama Queen', but not nearly as funny.It had a good message in the end, but who cares.

40,MsMovie,"A good first ""grown-up"" movie for Lindsay!",5,16 May 2006,"Just My Luck is a very cute, first grown-up type of movie for Lindsay Lohan to star in. She had a great supporting cast too, and the story had a beginning middle and end, always a good thing.I don't understand why people expected any more of this movie than exactly what it purports to be - a romantic comedy - it's not a teen movie, but it will appeal to original Lohan teen fans, and to adults alike (OK, mainly women).The story is about 2 people - one incredibly lucky woman, and one incredibly unlucky man - and one day their paths cross and they switch luck and both have to cope with how different their respective lives now are. Lohan's character figures out she lost her luck and sets out on a hapless crusade to get it back, with some genuinely funny moments.The music is also great in this movie, provided by McFly, credited as being ""introduced"" in this movie, and maybe to the American public they are, but to the UK audience of this film, McFly have been around for ages! Go to see this movie if you like romantic comedies like Kate & Leopold, etc, and if you want to relax and just veg out - don't go expecting the Da Vinci Code or anything, this is a cute, funny, feel-good comedy, with a nice little message and a good ending.I gave this 8 out of 10, it's well worth going to see!",Just My Luck
41,Sanou_san,Insufficient but satisfying,6,12 June 2007,"I was really astonished to found out that Lindsay Lohan had another romantic comedy movie with another cute guy (Chris Pine). However my expectations didn't blend that well when I already peered the movie, Just my Luck did have the wits and plot of the story, but I think the direction needs more furnishing to do, so as well with the dialogue of the characters. The nature of the story as the title suggests all right, the characters: Lindsay and Chris is an adorable couple, so as well with their supporting characters. One thing that distracts my grading sensation with this movie is that some of their dialogue appears to be completely claptrap. I understand the first time Ashley (Lindsay) was arrested, but the whole mud-reason arresting moment seems to be an idiotically lame portion of her arrest. Another one when Jake (Chris) and Ashley first dance, just because Ashley found Jake to be that cute and Jake found Ashley to be that exceedingly attractive then they kissed already? For the profession and position of Ashley I think she don't have some sort of self-respect for hanging a minute with a guy she doesn't even met before, it's totally silly.I guess what I'm trying to convey here dudes is that some part or maybe 40% of the script are lousy, the direction come out to be poor. The characters are fine, especially Lohan and I start to like Chris for this is the first time I saw him. The wit may have brought an impact but the atmosphere of the acting didn't mixed goodly at all, it would have been better if Mark Waters directed this film.Irrefutably honest, I still like the film, but I would rate it precisely as 6.5 out of 10.",Just My Luck
42,markymark70,not great....but not as bad as people make out.....,6,5 May 2009,"First off - I am not a great LL fan. Sure, I can look at her in photos - but when it comes to moving images on a movie screen, she doesn't have the same appeal. Besides, I still remember her as a little girl and it is a little creepy and off-putting looking at her as a grown up woman. But that's just me.Anyway, the premise for this movie struck me straight away as a good way to while away some time and I watched it as a 'family night' with my family - my wife and 3 kids (2 boys and a 6 year girl). I was waiting for dissenting voices from the boys - who are more of a Fast N Furious type movie fan - but heard nothing.It was better than I thought it would be. Pine does well as the luckless good guy and the appearance of McFly was not as bad as most pop-star pop-ups in films. Lohan's 2 friends were watchable also. The only let down for me was Lohan herself. As pretty as she is - looks can't do it on their own. She was wooden and seemed the most inexperienced actor on show which is an unusual feat as she has plenty of screen time behind her.The plot is pure hokum but it is a light, fluffy way to pass a couple of hours. Some of the jokes didn't hit home but there was more hits than misses. The one thing that didn't ring true with me was Lohan's character. Yes she was lucky but she wasn't a bad enough person to root against. So she hadn't enough of a turnaround throughout the movie to show the audience she had truly changed. In fact, she seemed well capable of knuckling down to work when she had to - at the bowling alley - and her only failing was the insane good fortune which followed her everywhere. Maybe she didn't realise how such good luck affected her closest friends but that isn't a capital punishment offence.All in all - the film has some flaws but there is enough about it to make it enjoyable. Maybe if the transformation of Lohan from selfish-girl to appreciative-girl was more pronounced - the audience would have got more out of it. But all in all - it wasn't a complete bust.6/10",Just My Luck

When they meet again without knowing that they kissed in the ball, Jack is a successful manager and she is a wreck.He offers Ashley a cleaning job which is what he used to do before kissing Ashley.

45,jwhale9382,"Movie lovers are in ""luck""",8,20 December 2007,"When I first heard about this movie, I actually didn't want to see it for the ""star power"". I was actually more interested in the storyline. I saw it and I loved it. I can't believe all the grief this movie's been getting from online reviewers.The movie centers around two characters: Ashley Albright (Lindsay Lohan) and Jake Hardin (Chris Pine). Ashley is the luckiest girl in New York. She's the successful assistant at a major advertising agency and, even when she doesn't plan on it, things always seem to go her way. However, this lifestyle of 'always getting her way' has given her a big head. Jake is the unluckiest guy in New York. Nothing ever seems to work out for Jake. To make ends meet, he works at a local bowling alley, doing whatever his short-tempered boss orders him to do. He does have his safety nets: friends at the police station, the hospital and EMS on speed-dial, extra supplies for every emergency, all the lucky charms he can find, and the loving support of his friends and family. Both Ashley and Jake's worlds are turned upside-down, when they meet at a promo party, kiss, and switch luck with each other.As I said before, the part I liked best is the overall idea of the story. It's hysterical watching Ashley learn how sheltered her life has been and how harsh reality can be, and it's equally hilarious seeing Jake react to his sudden change in luck.Although the casting was no my greatest concern in the movie, I thought the movie was well cast. Lindsay Lohan shines in this movie. This is her cutest movie in a long time. After all the trashy roles she's done (Mean Girls, Confessions of a Teenage Drama Queen, I Know Who Killed Me), it's nice to see her in a cute and down-to-earth role. I haven't seen many of Chris Pine's movies (except for the Princess Diaries), but I thought he was great as Jake. He managed to keep his character both funny and charming. The rest of the cast was great too. Missi Pyle as Ashley's boss, Fazion Love as the record producer which both Ashley and Jake are trying to impress, Makenzie Vega as Jake's lovable little cousin and Ashley and Jake's friends, offering their support to their hard-lucked friends.Despite it's PG-13 rating, this movie IMO is safe for the whole family to enjoy (but just to be safe, parents may want to check it out first). It's funny, it's cute and, yes, it's romantic. I recommend this movie to all the Lindsay fans out there and to anyone who likes cute, funny movies.My rating: 8/10",Just My Luck
46,astymegoesby,Sabrina Goes to Rome Ripoff,4,17 November 2006,"Well, the movie in my summary quote is hard to find, but if you watch it and watch Just My Luck, you will see the similarities.Melissa Joan Hart and Lindsay Logan have one thing in common. They both cannot act. Both speed their way through their movies and leave the poor viewer trying to catch up on the verbal spew.Chris Pine was better as the bad guy with a horrible accent in the sequel of Princess Diaries then in this trash. The music was dreadful and so corny, cheesy and stereotypical, it was disgusting to sit through an hour and thirty plus minutes of this garbage.Note to self, no more Lindsay Logan movies. Girl can sing, but not act. Even the remake ""Freaky Friday"" was like pulling teeth. Original was so much better.I would have rated this lower, but the reason it got a 4/10 is because there were no mistakes in Geography!!

47,GrimmBrother,A predictable comedy that anyone could've written,3,24 December 2006,"The Plot Ashley is the luckiest girl alive. Everything seems to work out well for her and everything she touches turns to gold. But one night at a party she kisses a mystery man who is the unluckiest guy in the world. After they kiss, their luck swaps. Now the man is the luckiest guy in the world and Ashley is the unluckiest girl in the world. Ashley goes on a kissing quest to find the guy who has ridden her with bad luck. HmmI wonder how it is going to end?The Pros This film has its moments. The only entertaining parts were the scenes where bad luck kicked in, causing the protagonists utter humiliation.The Cons This film requires suspension of disbelief that you just cannot give it. How is it possible to give in to a modern day world where two young people, one unbelievably lucky and one unbelievably unlucky, swap luck by kissing each other? As you can see it suffers from a lousy plot and even worse directing.One must wonder who sits in an office, picks up this script, reads it and decides to turn it into a film when there are so many other better scripts out there that would make great films. It is just too hard to take seriously.The Final Word Apparently this is Lindsay Lohan's last lame teenage movie and then she is moving on to more serious roles, which is a relief since she is not a bad actress. I guess any young person these days will go see a movie with Lindsay Lohan in the cast. Just My Luck was just pathetic.",Just My Luck
48,sugar_daddyo,Formulaic,4,8 October 2007,"This is the first, and mostly certainly last, LL movie I have ever seen so I was really more interested in watching what all the LL hype is about than the movie. To be frank I am a little puzzled:She has this scratchy, hoarse voice that is big put off. - She is far from being a Zeta-Jones, Jolie, or Kidman...so really? what is all the hype about? All I can think is her mom must have a lot of clout.Anyway, as far as the movie is concerned, it is a typical romantic comedy of which there are so many. LL is Ashley (such a quaint name these days) who works in NYC as a PR agent (hmmm, never heard of that one before either). She meets a boy, and well, the rest is hardly anymore surprising. So the only reason I could think of watching this movie is if you're on a first or second date or just plain out of luck.",Just My Luck
49,pedrosmgfan,Lindsay has disappointed me,4,21 August 2006,"Before I saw ""Just my Luck"" I thought it was going to be entertaining and cute, but it wasn't. When I saw this movie, I felt really disappointed. First, because I love Lindsay Lohan and I thought she will give something good to this movie, but she didn't. Second, because this movie is finally a typical American teen comedy in which a man and a woman fall in love.This movie tells us the story of Ashley Albright, the luckiest person in New York, who organizes a masks party for a man, she meets Jake and kisses him. After kissing Jake, who is the unluckiest person in New York, he gets the good luck and she gets the bad luck. After that, Ashley will look for the man who stole her luck.In the cast of the movie Lindsay Lohan plays Ashley, Chris Pine plays Jake, Faizon Love as rich Damon Phillips and Missi Pile as Ashley's boss, Peggy Braden.Teenage girls will love this movie, but I don't think boys will like. ""Just my Luck"" is the typical comedy in which a man and a woman fall in love and the people around also find a love.",Just My Luck
50,typhill,Just My Luck,5,25 June 2006,"Yay, another Lindsey Lohan movie. Honeslty I was curious about how this movie would end. It wasn't a complete disastrous movie.The jokes were funny at times. They gave a few good laughs at times, but other times they tried to give jokes and just failed completely. The plot was....alright.....Guy has bad luck, girl has good luck, it switches, girl goes to find guy to get luck back.The acting was bad at times. Lindsey Lohan isn't that bad of an actor, but the other people were horrible. At times her acting fell apart and at times it was good, she needs to keep it good and consistent.Overall this was an okay movie, but nothing I'd see twice",Just My Luck
51,Lily-32,Not Deserving of the Overly Harsh Reviews,10,4 June 2006,"I admit three things.1) Not a Lindsay Lohan fan. The only other LL movie I liked was The Parent Trap. ""Confessions..."", ""Freaky Friday"", ""Mean Girls"", ""Herby"", etc. I didn't enjoy them at all (which was surprising because normally some of those flicks are my cup of tea). 2) Frist time I saw a preview for ""Just My Luck"" I wasn't very interested in seeing it. 3) The only real reason I wanted to see this movie is because I loved Chris Pine in Princess Diaries 2 and thought he was gipped on some much deserved screen time in that one so I wanted to see what else he had to offer - because honestly, that deleted scene from PD2 with him and Mia (Anne Hathaway) in the kitchen was faboo and never EVER should have been left on the cutting room floor. What's worse is that GM never said WHY they cut that scene.That said, I ended up loving ""Just My Luck."" Call me crazy and say I have no taste. I don't care. I came for the hottie I stayed for the movie.Was this an award winning movie? No and I doubt it was ever hoped to be by anyone who went in to make it.Did it have flaws? Yes. (A few but a minor one that bugs me enough to mention but has no real factor on liking or disliking this movie is the freeze-frame at the end. Should have cut to black instead but that's just me. Freeze-frames are tricky things that should be used rarely and wisely.)Does it deserve to be bashed and tagged as the ""worst movie of 2006""? Definitely not. As about two other people have said, this was a cute, fun, escape-reality-for-90-minutes-to-an-hour kind of a movie with no pretenses to be anything other that what it was.Okay, so I agree that there were moments when Lohan's acting could have been improved (the two that stick out in mind are when that blonde guy first joins her in the elevator and when she's looking at the broken mirror at the very end). But you can find bad acting in even the so called ""best movies"" of the year. Sometimes no matter what they do, some dialogue or scene comes off clunky. It happens. We move on.Overall - considering my opinion on LL in general - I was pleasantly surprised by her in this movie. She's another Julia Roberts to me. I'm not a real fan but she's got a movie or two that I enjoy.I thought Chris Pine was just adorable in that geeky, down on his luck optimist who (in his characters own words) ""gave up years ago. That's my secret to happiness."" He was tender and hopeful and just head over heals for a girl who before the ball would never given him a second glance.I was surprised but glad that they didn't delve two much deeper into the workings of this ""change of luck"" thing. You knew the kiss was the key and as far as the actual workings of it all, that's all that mattered. The more important part is what happens to the two fortunate/unfortunate souls sucked in by this crazy bit of magic.When the movie wound down to a close I thought of about a dozen different ways it could have ended. The one they chose is the one I love the best. Two people who would love to have good luck all the time - having experienced the worse first hand - but would rather the other be happy instead.I loved the scene at the end when they both refused to keep the luck, trading it back and forth until no one knew who had the luck and who didn't. Ashley really grew to the point that she was willing to sacrifice that for someone else which in the end made her deserving of the great guy that Jake is.And what better way to bring it all to a close then to give the luck to a little girl who is still young enough to be either corrupted into cynical thinking or learn the lesson that Jake and eventually Ashely did; Luck comes and goes. What you do with that luck helps define who you are.Maybe I got a little to philosophical on a movie that I said was just a bit of fun. I don't care. I thought this movie was all kinds of wonderful. It's one that when the credits began to roll my first thought was ""I'll totally buy it when it comes out on DVD"". That's how I know I really liked a movie.I see this movie as an underdog of sorts. And when it comes to movies I tend to prefer the underdog. When someone talks up a movie too much it tends to turn me off (It was only at the very last minute that I changed my mind and decided to watch both Harry Potter and Lord of the Rings, two series that I had sworn off due to people raving too much for my tastes).If that makes me a person with bad taste in movies, then so be it. I'll live happy in my ignorance.I would definitely see this movie again. And again and again. As I said, I'll buy my copy of the DVD the day it's released.I give this movie a ten because even though it wasn't perfect, I feel the need to offset some of the really unnecessarily bad reviews and scores it got from others.AL",Just My Luck
52,ruanstb,Unoriginal formula for comedy romance,4,14 October 2006,"I admire movies that teach us little life lessons, and this is one of those movies. Lindsay Lohan once again is really good as a comedy actress and she delivers a fine performance in a movie that is OK. ""Just My Luck"" just doesn't pull out the stops, lacks new ideas and is ludicrous more often than funny or amusing. Hmm, lead-actor-geek turns gorgeous and stops wearing glasses while dazzling-lead-actress turns into a droop and they find love. I'm not so much uptight about the movie being silly, it's just very uninspiring. It could have been made for the sole purpose of promoting McFly in the USA did their record company buy this movie? That wouldn't be so hard to believe. I really didn't like the McFly boys and wished that their parts in the movie be narrowed to mute cameos. Although ""Just My Luck"" is completely harmless and cute, I am happy to say that I will never sit through it again. If you liked this movie I would strongly recommend Freaky Friday or a McFly concert ;) Best bit: Lindsay out of luck and in jail: ""Is this your floor too?""",Just My Luck
53,mrsknoll,I loved it,10,22 September 2006,"I loved this movie. It was the sweet, feel-good movie that they advertised - and I was disappointed that it was a dud at the box office. Chris Pine's character is one that you can't help but fall in love with. You want him to succeed in all of his endeavors because he is simply so warm-hearted. He would do anything for anyone (and he does) and he touches the lives of those who come into his life. Lindsay Lohan's character is one of those he helps bring a little sunshine to, despite her new down-and-out luck. I felt that the previews made ""Ashley"" (Lindsay's character) look a bit like an elitist snob - even the jacket cover shows her with this wink like she knows she's got it all. The writers and director (and of course, Lindsay) did a wonderful job of keeping that view out of the film. She is kind and caring throughout the film (well, there's a little conversation with a fortune teller that she's not the nicest in) - especially with her interactions between friends (and Pines' character ""Jake""). The two compliment each other very well. Their chemistry is believable and their romance is one that you root for.The only thing that I would have done differently is one scene where she eats someone else's food because she is hungry from a lonnnnng night. I skipped over it on the DVD because I felt that it took away from her. She was graceful and had dignity, stood her ground and hoped that the fates would come back her way - then they tossed that scene in. The scene could have started and ended the same, but the middle (the begging for scraps) really left a bad taste in my mouth. Good thing it's a relatively early scene, so I had forgotten about it by the end! I would absolutely recommend this movie to anyone who likes feel-good, romantic comedies (aka ""chick flicks""). It's a great rental and Lindsay really lights up the screen with her smile (and gorgeous hair!) and Chris Pine is definitely an up-and-comer in Hollywood to watch out for! If you liked 13 going on 30, How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days or Freaky Friday - this one is for you!",Just My Luck
54,universalcritics,Freaky Friday Part 2,7,22 May 2006,"JUST MY LUCK is a romance-comedy movie starring media favorite LINDSEY LOHAN as Ashley, an extremely lucky and happy business women. At first, it seems she has all the luck in the world it's raining, no umbrella, she walks out onto the street and the sun starts shining. Wow, that's sounds great. Unfortunately, this doesn't last and Ashley's luck runs out when she meets and kisses unlucky Band Manager Jake played by CHRIS PINE. Well is it just me or does something always get switched around in every Lindsey Lohan movie. Let's see in Freaky Friday she switched bodies with her mom, in Mean Girls she switched personalities and in this one she switches luck with Jake. Hmmm, I'm no agent but I think Lindsey's in danger of being typecast with these types of movies. Anyways back to the movie, after the switch things instantly go downhill. Like she breaks her high heel, which is a terrible thing to happen to any girl, and she gets arrested. This is probably the best part of the movie. It's funny to watch Ashley struggle with her newfound bad luck and Jake flourish with his new good luck. In fact Ashley's bad luck is an assortment of disasters, one after the other. On the other hand, Jake's new luck brings him many amazing opportunities that he would have only dreamed about previously He has the band he's managing, McFly, signed by a record company. And while he's being offered a great big penthouse, Ashley goes home to find hers flooded and destroyed. Ashley quickly figures out that her luck has been ""switched"" with the kiss and she seeks out Jake in hopes to regain her luck. The two coincidentally meet and Jakes is happy to show Ashley the ropes in regard to dealing with her misfortune. Finally, the end of the movie, Ashley has to make some sort of a sacrifice, just like in Freaky Friday, until everything can go back to normal. All around the movie has a few moments and the audience gets to hear some of the British band McFly's music.",Just My Luck
55,Doctor_No,"""Freaky Friday"" anyone? Lohan and Pine prove that it is ""just my luck""",7,16 May 2006,"A halfway decent seemingly redux to ""Freaky Friday"" where Lohan also starred. Lets face it these pompous brats are inheriting the celebrity world while work slips through the fingers of Oscar winning actors/actresses. I am shocked to see everyone so giddy over these young faces but with this movie I am starting to realize why.A lucky Manhattan woman Ashley Albright (Lohan) seems to have lost her luck when a fateful kiss at a party with unlucky and accident prone Jacke Hardip (Pine). Afterwards the effect is groundbreaking where they trade personalities and luck.I will admit the story is over done and half way through we can tell what the end with draw but these young kids show so talent in the midst. With the right script and a better director aside from Donald Petrie who's half @ss job takes the movie just so far before it cops out on us. And Petrie has a good run but when the films meaning is clearly looked at we can see it is cliché' and a low brow teenage, perhaps even a slumber party, girl bonanza flick which I just can't handle all the way through. Still much better then I expected and surprisingly decent.",Just My Luck
56,goddardr,"If you liked ""Freaky Friday"" odds are you will like this",6,21 May 2006,"My pre-teen daughter and I decided to watch this movie - okay, she decided and I went along with it - which turned out to be an okay flick for me and a delight for her. This wasn't too surprising considering how this movie was signed, sealed, and packaged directly to your favorite stadium theater. Lindsey Lohan plays Ashley, a young energetic New York promotional agency gofer who we quickly finds out has a knack for being lucky. On the other end of the scale is Jake (Chris Pine) who does odd jobs at a bowling alley while trying to promote a local band for a recording contract, but just can't seem to catch a break because he is the antithesis of being lucky. Now, you know at some point Ms. Lucky has to meet Mr. Un-lucky and then the fun begins.The charm of the movie rests mostly on the two main actors, Lohan and Pine. Lohan, who showed she could do comedy in the movie ""Freaky Friday"" is at least as good in this movie with Pine being equal to the task. The movie depends on a fair amount of slapstick because unlucky people have a lot of odd things happen to them, so be forewarned if you don't find this kind of comedy enjoyable. The problem with slapstick is that it is often overplayed, losing the story and the characters in the process. Fortunately, the director, Donald Petrie, who has extensive comedy experience from ""Grumpy Old Men"" to ""Miss Congeniality"", knows how to set the tone so the visual comedy doesn't bruise the story or characters in the process.For sophisticated movie goers, this probably shouldn't be their first choice, but for my daughter and I, it was the perfect movie. She squealed with delight at many times and I found it amusing and sweet for the most part. There weren't any portions I found inappropriate for my daughter on this PG-13 movie. It doesn't break any fresh ground, but sometimes you need to take a break from action-packed or serious flicks and have a few light-hearted moments. If this is what you need to take your mind off of your hectic life, this will fit the bill.",Just My Luck

This was watched by me and my sister in the cinema and now after watching it another 3-4 times since then, I can still say that I love this movie. THe concept is good, the idea of two individual people, made for one another, but completely different when it comes to luck. Lohan is a happy lucky young lady, who is envied by her friends as she gets luck after luck. From being promoted in her job to dating an eligible bachelor, she has everything a girl could want from an extravagantly beautiful apartment to expanding wardrobes. She is living everyones dream life. Pine on the other hand is not so lucky, in fact, he is nowhere near. Trying to get the band he is managing noticed, he comes across many funny, comical moments, such as picking up a 5 dollar bill which has been used to pooper scoop. THis and many other bad things occur until the two meet at a Masquerade party and inevitably kiss on the dance floor, switching fates.From the beginning I liked this film, Lohan (until most recently) has been one of my favourite teen actresses since I watched Mean Girls and Confessions of a teenage drama queen. THis is a brilliant chick flick and definitely should be watched by all.",Just My Luck
58,cactuscab,Why does this movie hate laughter,1,25 November 2006,"The worst type of film you can spend your time watching is an unfunny comedy. It becomes an endurance test, how much horrible word play, pseudo hip dialogue exchanges and ham fisted physical comedy can you withstand. Really a comedy, unlike other genres has only one goal: make the audience laugh. If you don't accomplish that, no matter how pretty the sets are, how much effort the actors give, it's all for naught. All this preamble for Just My Luck, because really there is not much to say about it. Lohan (so great in Mean Girls) seems to have let her cardboard cut out twin act in most of the scenes. Totally lacking any charisma. The story does her no favors being completely asinine. A good early indication of how wrong the movie is in its attempt at comedy is the opening scene where the young man tries to deliver the music CD to the music executive (I know these character have names, I just couldn't be bothered for a movie like this). Everything goes wrong for the character in this scene. An audience that has any reference for comedy will see every complication well before it happens. This kills a comedy. Laughter comes from unexpected events. Not a single thing in this movie happens that we are not all ready ahead of. Two stars.",Just My Luck
59,quark18,"Fun, sweet, screwball comedy about luck",7,30 March 2019,"I'm watching this movie in 2019 as a fan of Chris Pine, not Lindsay Lohan. I've never seen Lohan in anything before and I can't understand the bad reviews. Her performance here is fine, with the exception of the bacon scene where she doesn't look hungry, but doing multiple takes of eating scenes is hard on actors. Her bad reviews seem to coincide with her name appearing in the tabloids around that time. Considering recent news coming out about widespread abuse of children in Hollywood, I have a lot of empathy for child actors and would cut her a break.Ashley (Lohan) is a very lucky young lady who does not think she is lucky. She just feels entitled to have everything go her way, from getting cabs to finding money. Until she loses her luck. There is a lesson here for those who wish to see it, but it's totally possible to watch this slapstick comedy without any serious reflection at all.In contrast, Jake (Pine) is a very UNlucky young man for whom everything goes wrong and he cannot even cross the street from home to work without getting bird crap on him and nearly run over by a car. (The way that driver cursed at him is very New York.) Jake is almost too good to be true, maintaining a positive attitude and amazing persistence in the face of constant disaster. He is perfectly sweet to his young cousin Katie, who also has lousy luck. His constant bad fortune makes him empathize with others who are down on their luck. There is a lesson here, too, for those who wish to see it.Ashley and Jake exchange luck with a kiss at a masquerade ball and there is another lesson here, in how much difference a little luck can make in a person's life. Luck can be the difference between a janitor job cleaning backed-up toilets and a wealthy life as the manager of a rock group (Jake). Luck can be the difference between that same disgusting janitor job and Vice President of a PR firm (Ashley) where throwing A-list parties is ""work."" Same person, same skills, same personality. Just different luck.To Jake's credit, he remains sweet after his sudden good fortune. To Ashley's credit, she realizes that living a charmed life isn't much fun if the people she cares about do not share in it. And it is to both their credit that they voluntarily give the luck to someone who needs it even more than they do, the little Katie.Okay, I understand that the filmmakers wanted to produce screwball physical comedy, but it was sometimes too contrived. That scene of Ashley dancing with the floor-polishing machine was funny but after losing all her shoes in her flooded apt, there's no way she'd have worn those ridiculous slippery heels to that job. Also, dropping her last contact lens into the litter pan might be bad luck, but picking it up and putting it back in her eye without rinsing it in disinfectant is plain stupid.Not everything is based on luck. Jake's knowledge of music and his persistence are independent of luck. Ashley got her big break due to luck, but she was prepared enough to improvise a PR plan to a major client, given the unexpected opportunity.Both Jake and Ashley learn to be better prepared about things in general, to leave less to luck.That studio shared by Ashley's friends Maggie and Dana is much more realistic about housing in NYC than ""Sex and the City,"" which is particularly referenced here.It is interesting to see the contexts in which people say things like, ""When one door closes, two others open"" and ""the wheel always spins back."" They are said by people who have suffered misfortunes and are desperately hoping that things will improve.I am in that situation right now. That must be why I keep watching this dvd, hoping that my luck will change. It is a fun, light comedy that can be watched and enjoyed many times.It is fascinating that the careers of Mr Pine and Ms Lohan went in opposite directions after 2006, exactly as depicted in this movie. Eerie.Chris Pine seems to really enjoy doing physical comedy. I did not know how good an acting job he did in this one until I tracked down a copy of ""Confession,"" where he plays a very dark character, also convincingly. I think he would like to do more of those, too, instead of being cast mainly for his beautiful face.The character Damon is really funny. I have no idea if bigshot music producers actually act like that, but I hope they do.Finally, this film also works as an introduction to the real-life band McFly. What a fun idea, to make a film about a band where the musicians play key roles but do not have the burden of carrying the film. We can enjoy their music while spending most of the film watching the professional actors. The band's performance was fine. I picked up their album after watching this movie.",Just My Luck

Some of the actors do not deliver great performances, and the story line is not very believable. But if you go to a movie with like this with lofty goals in mind, you're sure to be disappointed.

This is worse -- it's professionally bad. Everything is smooth and marginally professional and completely predictable, and painfully boring.I saw this because there was a slight ""not as bad as you expect"" buzz, and now I'll admit I was suckered.

62,VideoJoeD,Not great but should entertain most.,4,1 October 2006,"A significant percentage of IMDb voters seem to have assigned either a maximum 10 or minimum 1 rating to this film. I have viewed a large number of films over the years and would assign these maximum or minimum values to only a small percentage of the films I have seen. This certainly would not qualify as a film I feel would be deserving of either of these extreme positive or negative rating values.Several reviewers have been extremely critical of the performance given by Lindsay Lohan in the film. I know that she has been the subject of various tabloid articles in the past. I never read those publications and had not seen any of her prior films, so I viewed this film with no pre-conceived expectations or bias. While she did not give a ground breaking or award winning performance, I feel she did a fairly credible job given the depth of the material provided.This film is not for those looking for heart pounding action, emotion draining romance or side splitting humor, but I think most young females will find it entertaining if they are able to overlook an unrealistic story-line. Many more mature females and some macho males might also find the film contains a touch of warmth, some romantic moments and provides a few chuckles over its' approximate 90 minute running time.The plot revolves around a young couple, the female blessed with an abundance of good luck and the male at the opposite end of the luck spectrum. They meet at a masquerade gala and exchange a magical kiss along with respective positions on the spectrum. What follows, although not always plausible, is often humorous and occasionally romantic. An IMDb rating of between 3 and 7 seems justified for this romantic comedy with a warm and upbeat conclusion. I personally gave it a 4 out of 10.",Just My Luck

I have been mostly disappointed. I've seen most of her movies since then and, although they were mostly fun to watch, they seemed to be ""Look-at-me-ain't-I-great"" pictures. The plots were not worthy; and the endings were disappointing. Now, let me say that, thankfully, this one was different. Ms. Lohan does a job that she proved she could do in ""Parent Trap"". Chris Pine does a first-rate job as the ""lovable loser"". Samaire Armnstrong and Bree Turner are great as her friends. The only other thing I had seen Turner in was ""Bring It On Again"" where she played a real b---h. Nice to see her in another type of role. And Makenzie Vega is adorable!My only problem with the cast is simply because I'm a big ""Law & Order"" fan. Tovah Feldshuh will always be the Danielle Melnick to me. A part she plays excellently. Couldn't quite accept her as a fortune teller. The plot moves along nicely and, like I said, it finally gives Lohan a movie that is something other than a vanity piece. It may not be around at Oscar time. But I'm sure it will be a favorite once it comes out on video.",Just My Luck
64,whassupwestcoast,Fun movie. But dumb.,4,22 May 2006,"""Just My Luck"" is a bit silly. OK, a lot silly.Lindsay Lohan's character is so lucky that she doesn't even realize most people lose playing scratch'n'win lottery tickets. On the other hand, Chris Pine's character is the exact opposite. He's so unlucky that he  well, amusing things happen. ""Just My Luck"" plays off with the idea that luck is something quite tangible and can be passed between partners by  say  kissing: like mono or cooties.There are, actually, a lot of funny scenes in the movie and I did spend most of the movie either laughing or at least smiling.""Just My Luck"" is a kids' movie. The odd thing, though, for a kids' movie the soundtrack was awfully old sounding. And, music is a huge part of the plot. I'd of thought the demographic  musically-speaking- would not be so keen on early Beatle's sound-a-like bands. But who knows? The humour though is right up to date. One scene revolves around dog poo. Another scene features a well used kitty litter box. Oh, and the up-chucking. I mustn't forget the scene with the characters up-chucking.Personally, I'd rather have early Beatle's humour (i.e. A Hard Day's Night) and up to date music. Oh well.",Just My Luck

66,sparkster24,Films with music stars keep getting poorer,4,19 July 2006,"Films have a poor reputation when they involve stars from the music industry (or should I say 'pop stars' as I categorically refuse to put Britney Spears and McFly in the same batch as the deity Bach and Wagner). Thus, I wasn't expecting much when I got up at a ridiculously early time so I could see the only showing Brighton Marina cinema had of Just My Luck with an audience consisting of 3 people (including me).The storyline is predictably simple, Ashley (played by Lindsay Lohan) has good luck and Jake (played by Chris Pine) has bad luck. Ashley holds down a successful job although the audience is unaware of what job she is successful at. By contrast, Jake is head of a small-time band known as McFly. Ashley gets lucky (although what you mean by 'lucky' is key here, (see below,) by improvising for her company and landing a 'big-ball-date'. At this 'big ball', Ashley kisses Jake who has hijacked the ball as a professional dancer to try and get the prestigious Damon Phillips (played by Faizon Love) to look at his band. Via this kiss, Jake gains all of Ashley's luck and suddenly everything goes wrong for Ashley and everything goes right for Jake. McFly became famous and eventually are asked to play at a 'Hard Rock café'. After learning from a clairvoyant what has happened, Ashley tries looking for her luck doing random silly stuff including kissing all the professional dancers (which is probably why she took the role), eating someone's leftovers from an unhygienic cafe before, pivotally, falling for Jake. She eventually discovers Jake has 'stolen' (her words, not mine) her luck and she attempts to get it back from him. I shall stop at this point as I think to go any far would ruin the ending but, if the truth were told, it isn't anything to write home about.I believe commentators have gone a little too far in categorising it as one of the worst films ever made and may want to ask themselves for what reason they believe it to be so poor. It may not be a particularly a good film, but this it is difficult to see how it could have been any better. May be one criticism of this film is its target audience. The target audience is rather narrow, there is nothing that will stimulate you and the jokes are rather immature and 'teeny-poppy'. If you like that sort of thing, you might be happy seeing this film it was rather predictable from the outset what it was going to be like, Lindsay Lohan has too small a range to play to play any other character-types! So, we must accept that most people are going to be outside of its 'target audience'.I was disappointed with the characters, though, Ashley was, paradoxically not entirely an alpha female. I'm not sure who or what Ashley was supposed to be and I don't think the actor knew either. This was demonstrated in her mediocre acting. It doesn't seem realistic that Jake fell in love naturally with Ashley for any reason other than pity. Am I wrong in thinking that most girls don't want to be pitied? I think what annoyed me most the lack of basic coherent structure. As already alluded to in earlier statements, I don't think this film defines what luck actually is and, as a result, there is no clear distinction between what is 'luck' and what is 'intelligence'. For example, if someone works very hard to achieve a degree and gains a first, one wonders whether it was gained through pure luck or intellect? In contrast, Lindsay gets her position because she sits in on other people's discussions (according to the film) and based on what she has learnt decides the best way of organising a ball. Her offer is accepted and she does very well within her company, is this plain luck or is that because she deserved it? Later in the film, even when she knows that she has overdone the washing powder, she still switches it on even though she does not know where the 'off' switch I'm not sure what that has to do with luck. Similarly, when she tries to replace a lightbulb. What has this got to do with luck? The main point is that there is no 'depth' to this film. Here is a film looking for a theme and a structure. If it purports to be a comedy, I fail to see the joke. While it isn't the worst film you'd ever see you will probably come out feeling as dissatisfied as I did.",Just My Luck
67,YourMomInAGorillaSuit,One of the best Lindsay Lohan movies since Mean Girls.,7,29 May 2006,"I thought that this was an excellent movie. In the movie, Ashley(Lindsay Lohan) is the luckiest girl in the world until,she goes to a masquerade themed party and gets kissed by a handsome stranger( Chris Pine) who has horrible luck and their fates get switched. In the end, they both have pretty good decent luck. I think it was a good movie that many girls my age might enjoy. Some older people might like it too but if your between the ages of 12-15, you'll love it. I think it is one of the best Lindsay Lohan movies since Mean Girls. I recommend you go see it.It's a really cute movie.And I have no idea what else to say since IMDb wants me to have 10 lines and my original comment was about 8. Goodbye!",Just My Luck

Lindsey Lohan performed a mighty performance one of her best I've seen in years! McFly were good better than I expected and they made me feel like they were just being real which is very good. ""Just My Luck"" was a great film and Lindsey's bad luck is hilarious!!! I previously read a review saying it was Oscar worthy and yeah I think it deserves some sort of nomination but no way a Razzie!!! I just think it's not extraordinarily good but it light and all will enjoy especially the young kids! So go on buy or rent ""Just My Luck"" for a good light blockbuster!",Just My Luck

Even though some critics have called it awful I say don't listen to them. I have yet to see a critic make me laugh for about an hour and a half. Lindsay Lohan does an actually superb job as the girl who starts out having all the best luck in the world and then turns around to have the worst luck in the world(which is in a manner of speaking of course). The movie itself does one of the best things in the world which is that it conveys the message that as long as you have people around you who love and care about you, materialism just is not important. The movie itself is a wonderful message for anyone out there between the ages of 16 and 100 that if you just hang in long enough and don't give up that life will eventually work out just fine. There is also a scene with the washing machine that I thought was simply classic. Lindsay Lohan is a very smart and talented young actress who has been taking good roles since she got started with Freaky Friday and then Mean Girls which are also 2 other good movies for kids. I hope to see her in future comedies, she does a great job!",Just My Luck

I'm a fan of Lindsay Lohan so would've probably seen it anyway but it was nowhere near as good as Mean Girls or Herbie. Chris Pine is quite good in it. I think it was two obvious what was going to happen and definitely isn't the best movie Lohan has ever done.

It seems to have a high number of both 10/10s and 1/10s... as if you either love it or hate it? Well, I loved the fact that the movie distracted me enough to relax and unwind for an hour and a half. I didn't think it was groundbreaking, so originally I was going to give it 9/10, but also, I though it was very straightforward and plot twists are usually important parts of dramas and romantic comedies.The thing is, though; I've never expected romantic comedies to have very much story or be very heavy on plot. So, all I was looking for was something to occupy me... and I got it.There's not much else to say, except that I really don't think the movie was so bad that it deserves a 1/10. When you consider the genre, it was fairly average. Plus, ""blonde humor"" is funny, and I think that's why the girl-who-was-lucky was so silly: she was really not accustomed to thinking critically, relying on her good luck (i.e. a very positive, problem-free environment) to provide a platform for her success.",Just My Luck

She was only about 18 when she was filming it.And Donald Petrie is a good director. I love How To Lose A Guy In 10 Days and Miss Congeniality. I'm glad Donald got the chance to direct Lindsay Lohan.

So I should have known better when I let my best friend pick between the two movies that she'd pick ""Just My Luck"" (no offense to my best friend, you know who you are for reading this) I guess it's easier to pick the slower, less thought-provoking storyline, which come on, that is ""Just My Luck"" compared to ""Failure to Launch""...

She has become a teen idol, that has been able to reach success with her songs and acting career. Paris Hilton is trying to achieve similar status, but I doubt she will reach the top like Lindsay Lohan.Just My Luck is the type of movie that will appeal to young people as well as troubled adults. If you have ever felt, like you have the worst luck in the world, then you will be encouraged by this movie. Jake Hardin(Chris Pine) plays a ticking time bomb of never ending failure, until he meets Ashley Albright(Lindsey Lohan) with a magical kiss.Whatever Jake Hardin(Chris Pine) trys to do, he ends up almost killing himself and being a total embarrassment to the band he is trying to promote. Lindsey Lohan plays the luckiest girl in the world. Her friends sit back and watch as her life unfolds into a fairy tale. She wins money playing scratch off tickets and wins the admiration of her boss.Lindsay Lohan single-handedly wins the trust of a big music producer, while her boss and the other associates remains trapped in an elevator. Once the boss shows up for the meeting, the music producer has already agreed to have them host his music party. Lindsay Lohan's boss is so impressed, that she gets to make the party plan preparations and gets her own office.Guys will like certain parts of the movie, being that it is a chick flick. Mainly the parts with Lindsay Lohan and lets face it, she is the only reason a guy would watch this movie. Is this movie a winner? Unfortunately, it is not a winner. She was much better in, ""Freaky Friday"", where she was playing in a cool band.This movie is predictable and you know early on that something is going to go wrong for her. Lindsey might want to look at playing a role as a prostitute, because she has been playing the nice sweet girl in all of her recent movies. What she does in her personal life, might make a better movie. She seems to be very far away from the Mickey Mouse Club!If you paid to see this movie in the theater, I feel sorry for you, because you were robbed. Not just robbed of your dignity, but robbed financially! Even her other movies were some what bearable, but this movie was like rolling naked down a hill of broken glass! One movie-goer on line said, ""no surprises, it's as bad as you expected."" When I read that comment in the IMDb.com movie review section, I started laughing. This movie is painfully boring!At one point in the movie, Jake Hardin(Chris Pine) is attacked by the feces of some pigeons. This whole movie was attacked by pigeons and covered in dung! The movie, just could not get the wings to fly on its own. The wings were broken from the start! When I was done watching this movie, I said, ""Just My Luck!"" It would have been refreshing if the movie, had some imagination vs utter boredom! Cutting raw onions would have been more pleasing than watching this movie. Not to mention, I would have had a good reason for crying!Can Walt Disney save Lindsay Lohan's career choices? Will she choose another role, that only a pigeon will fly over? Will Lindsay play the bad girl, that she really wants to be? This comedy will leave you looking for a qualified therapist.

It doesn't break any new ground but it is very successful in being what it is - a fun and very cute little movie with engaging stars and predictable yet enjoyable set pieces.Say what you will about Ms. Lohan as a person, as an actress she has extraordinary screen presence. You can't take your eyes off of her and she brings legitimacy to every scene she's in. Ditto for young Mr. Pine who performs very admirably throughout.The script is pretty much rote Hollywood material, but it succeeds in connecting all the dots and not overextending itself. It is thankfully light on the cringe inducing awkward dialogue that plagues recent comedies. The direction by Donald Petrie is professional in that it doesn't draw too much attention to itself and keeps the proceedings moving at a pace that is brisk but not hurried.In all, I smiled widely throughout, laughed often and welled up slightly at the appropriately contrived yet not glib coda.",Just My Luck

But the acting and script were about as bad as it gets, filled with every cliché possible, and there was even a stumble with dialogue with one character. The only reason I even gave this 2 stars was because, believe it or not, the concept of the movie was great. Good luck girl meets bad luck guy--fun concept, and should have been a fun movie. But it lacked charm, humour, and every line was spoken over the top.

Both guys and gals should be able to enjoy it...it was very funny, and, while it has a bit of corniness to it in parts, it's not over-the-top-so-bad-it-makes-me-want-to-gag or anything like that.Maybe it was too clean for people? Because you don't get to see them having sex or something, your disappointed? Too bad. There is a sparsity of films that are clean enough for a family to see together.

One day, at the masquerade bash that she organized, Madame Z, the future teller warned Ashley that she might lose her luck to someone else, hence, Ashley ignored. Jake (Chris Pine) shows up at the masquerade bash, lying to the guys that he is a dancer, get's into the party without an invitation and shares a kiss with Ashley. And...that's when she loses her luck.Jake, who was a loser all his life becomes the luckiest guy and Ashley...well not so much. She learns that when a door closes, another one opens. That's when she decides to go to Madame Z to get her luck back thinking she was the one who had stolen it in the first place. When Z told her that she lost it by giving a kiss, she could get it back just the same. So, Ash, collects the photos of 20 dancers who were the dancers at the bash and goes around town kissing each and everyone of them scratching the lotto tickets like a maniac to see if her luck has returned. When none of the dancers turn out the person she kissed, she gives up.And blah blah, she finds her partner, kisses him and blah blah and they live happily ever after.McFly the band play as themselves in this movie, and I must say, they did a good job. Dougie looked cuter than ever and Harry acted hilariously retarded.Bottom line is- Not a good movie, I'd say average but not really worth your money. What's really irritating is that Lindsay plays quite the same roles in every teen movie. In Freaky Friday, she switched bodies with her mom, and now in Just My Luck, she swaps her luck soul to a guy she doesn't even know. Although some will enjoy it more than others, I don't know.

I found myself, on more than one occasion, declaring out loud ""Oh my God, this is so freaking retarded."" The cinematography doesn't make up for the terrible, lame script. There aren't any really beautiful shots to marvel.

Like Freaky Friday, there is a 'role-reversal' and mega Compassion theme going on. Because of her saucy Ginger Spice looks and elegant profile, Lohan is most useful in roles that demand comedic and dramatic performances, although not simultaneously.After watching this movie I feel a little guilty realizing that I may have watched it because I subconsciously wanted to see Lindsay Lohan get the cow dung dropped on her. Kind of the same reason people went to see House of Wax - to see Paris Hilton suffer, although for me I didn't want to have to sit through Paris' acting, which I know is just going to be BAD.Lohan's presence in this movie is not very different from what she has shown us in Freaky Friday, which is kind of nice to remember. Except, in this movie she shows an even better understanding of her character, and carries the movie more than her co-star. I think soon we will see her carry an entire movie on her own. What I like about Lohan's movies is the fact that they always include awesome rock tracks!! If you are an LL fan, this is definitely the coolest Lindsay Lohan movie to get on DVD.",Just My Luck
89,SameeMan,Great concept Not so great movie,3,13 August 2006,"I like to call myself another victim of the magic of advertising. Once I saw the trailer of ""Just My Luck"", I thought it would be great. Since, I liked ""How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days"" by the same director, I thought this movie would be something like that. However, I was very wrong The main problem with this movie is its script, which is very immature and predictable. There's nothing new to see here and you can predict almost everything. I even guessed the ending of this movie as soon as I saw the scene where ""Katy"" and ""Ashley"" talk for the first time. If you are into movies, you will too...If you overlook the silly script, then there comes the bad acting. What is wrong with Lindsey this time? She is totally overacting her part and the actresses who play as her two friends are not any better. It is as if they are doing roles of fairytale princesses. However, in my opinion, Cris Pine does his part well.However, I am not saying that this movie is 100% garbage. It has two or three enjoyable scenes, but that's about it. In my opinion, ""Just My Luck"" has a great concept, if it was not for the childish script and bad acting this could have been a very entertaining comedy.",Just My Luck
90,coolit_mitali,My First Lindsay Lohan Movie !! It Rocks !!,8,24 September 2006,This was actually my first Lindsay Lohan film and i loved it. Its a pretty cool fairytale story about a girl called Ashley (Lindsay Lohan) who always has good luck in her life and is considered as a good luck charm by her boss. But then she meets a cute boy Jake (Chris Pine) at a masquerade ball and they fall in love where she kisses him and their Luck switches. Jake who earlier used to have bad luck now gets Ashley's good luck and Ashley well she obviously gets the bad luck. This switch changes the life of the two lovers . Embark with Ashley on this super cute cool journey to get her luck back and find a Perfect Mr.Right for herself. This movie's definitely worth a watch for Lindsay lovers. Those who hate her well after this movie u wont think so . You may change Ur mind !!,Just My Luck
91,Daughter_of_the_Valar,Good for a movie night,7,3 February 2007,"OK i saw this at the cinema and was a bit disappointed but recently saw it again on DVD and found it to be much better than i remembered. I admit on first viewing it's a little cheesy and annoying but on second viewing, it's actually quite good. I think it has to do with the fact of seeing it in the comfort of my own lounge room. I also found that i wasn't as judgmental or analytic. If you just sit back and watch the movie for what it is, you'll enjoy it more. Otherwise you're just going to give yourself an aneurysm over plot holes in the script and whether some scenes had any point. I reckon it should have been released straight to DVD but whatever.Basically it's a fun, silly chick flick that relies a lot on physical comedy rather than wit. I'm more into witty comedy so it wasn't that funny for me but it was still amusing. I actually laughed quite a bit in one part that involves mud.Chris Pine is really good as Jake, if it wasn't for him then the whole movie would have fallen apart in my opinion. Plus i'm a huge fan of McFly so i had something extra to enjoy ;)In a nutshell...Just My Luck is really good for when you're having a movie night at someone's house and you want something cheery and simple to keep the mood light.",Just My Luck
92,CloudyNight,Are You Kidding Me?,3,21 May 2006,"I saw this movie knowing that I would be disappointed...but when you're desperately bored anything can happen, even me losing my resolve not to see it. The Acting: Now, its hard for me to say that ""she didn't do all that well"" when I'm not a professional actress myself, but...Lindsay Lohan (playing Ashley) didn't do all that well. She definitely overacted her part. I found her entirely fake, and she didn't seem very into the character, and she did not convince me of a single line. It was forced and her character was what many in the writing world would call a Mary-Sue. There were some moments that I could commend her on, but not so many that they blind me to her many, many mistakes. Pretty terrible job on her part.Chris Pine (playing Jake), on the other hand, did quite a good job......in fact, I probably would have loved this movie because of him if not for-The Script: Seriously, did I see the same movie that the director and actors saw the script for? The lines were completely and DISGUSTINGLY corny, and sounded horribly forced. They didn't come nearly as smoothly as they should have, and nothing seemed even remotely believable.My biggest problem was with the script, but there were many factors that led me to give such a low rating: the stunting, the camera shots used, and especially the forced acting that I saw. I was not disappointed, not really, as I expected the movie to be far worse, but I was by no means happy with it.A word of advice for Lohan, wherever she may be: You aren't a fairytale princess; take roles that will make you seem real, and not desperate to seem perfect.",Just My Luck
93,ioowatts,Could've been cute. Was not.,1,15 May 2006,"This movie was so so awful. I wanted to like it - I like Lindsay Lohan, I like fluffy romantic comedies, and I liked the premise of the story. But it was so bad. I came thisclose to walking out of the theater.Not even worth a rent.And not even ""so bad it's good"" either.You could see all the jokes coming a mile away and there was too much time spent on the subplot with the up-and-coming band.Also, for what I thought was supposed to be a ""romantic"" comedy, there was surprising little romance.The only good thing was Lindsay's dress in the Masquerade party scene. It was fantastic.",Just My Luck
94,office1,Freaky Friday II The Return... or something like that,3,27 May 2006,"I was amazed that my eight year old daughter found this movie almost as silly as I did, and thats not a good thing. I went with my Mother (82) and my daughter (8) and wished I was somewhere else. I don't usually feel that way, I liked Chris Pine in the Princess Diaries II and I liked Lindsay Lohan in Freaky Friday, I watch several movies with my daughter that I actually enjoy. I had to walk out at one point due to the shear stupidity of the scene. I am not saying that the movie was a total loss, I gave it a 3 after all, there were some good scenes and some good chemistry between Chris and Lindsay but the writer, Director and whoever handled the editing should reconsider the material. I would hate to think that was the best they got during filming... One highlight was the band, they were pretty good as were the friends. Missi Pyle's talent was completely wasted as the ""boss"" leaving this movie as a Lindsay Lohan vehicle that crashed on the way to the audience.Office",Just My Luck
95,gunsupbarbie,Worst Piece of Drivel I Have EVER Seen,1,24 May 2006,"This ""film"" as they call it was such an utter disaster. There was nothing endearing about it, nor was it funny, and the acting was terrible. Lohan was miscast as a mid-twenties career-woman. The idea that the audience was supposed to believe her as a moderately mature and accomplished lady is laughable. If I hadn't been on a date I would have walked out of the theater, and that is something I just don't do. Lindsay's co-star was fairly less nauseating than herself, but nothing special. It must be said that when he was feeling lucky, it was much more endurable than the campy cheese that was hurled at the viewer when Lohan's character was fortuitous.Bottom line: bad acting, bad writing, and horrible movie, overall. McFly was actually the highlight of Just My Luck ... well, actually, the credits were - and a chorus of relieved sighs harmonized as the lights came back on.",Just My Luck
96,vodkaduck,Just my luck I was stupid enough to pick this up!,3,26 August 2006,"*SPOILERS* I thought this would be a cute movie and to be fair it has a few fun moments but the rest...Most of the things that happen in the movie are just beyond un-realistic (even for a movie)How is it that Lohan's character can afford a fab NY apartment, but her friends who work at the same place live in a junky little studio? How do the police know that Antonio is a prostitute? How is it that she's never given her ""luck"" away before? How is it that she can control the weather? Oh, wait I forgot-she's lucky. I used to like Lohan, but lately I feel like her party girl, doesn't care about anyone attitude has rubbed off on her movie roles. She knows what will happen when she kisses Pine but she does it anyway without thinking about the consequences of it. If you do decide to rent this don't pay attention to her, focus instead on the supporting performances of her friends Armstrong and Turner, Pine and Faizon Love. At the very least, if you watch it you might get some fashion ideas. I'll be a little more careful next time I'm thinking of picking up one of her movies.",Just My Luck
97,bubblyrubberduck,Not the best comedy...,5,27 June 2006,"Well I just got back from seeing this movie and I have to say, its not my favorite. There were quite a lot of things that bugged me with this film.1. Lindsay Lohan is to immature of an actress to play this kind of roll. She is supposed to be a upper class very lucky business woman. It is supposed to come off as a very elegant and exquisite young woman, but instead, it seems like a teenager lost in a romantic comedy.2. The first song that McFly plays in this movie is way overplayed throughout the whole thing. We here the first two lines of the song about four times through this whole movie. Seriously, who signs a band with one song and then gives them a headliner at the Hard Rock Cafe.3. The script was horrible. Real people would not talk like this in real life, nor would they react to things like this. Sorry, but I don't have a flashback every twenty minutes, and I don't know many people who do.4. People may be ditsy, but they don't even compare to the clulessness of Ashley, the main character. This girl seriously needs a reality check. Things don't just happen the way you want when you want and its not THAT unusual for things not to go your way.Now I saw this movie at the dollar theater. It was cheaper for me to see it there then to rent it, so I don't regret doing so. But seriously, don't spend more than two dollars on this movie. But hey, if you like that kind of stuff, don't let me hold you back.",Just My Luck
98,alpinedigital,A terrific feel-good movie!,9,17 August 2006,"This movie has a great flow to it, some hilarious bad-luck events, and a very original plot. It's not what I'd call a 'must-see' but I cant see how anyone should be disappointed with it. The characters are just awesome, because in this movie, there aren't really any bad guys; There's nobody to dislike, which is rare. I gave it very high marks because it IS good, I don't find it lacking in any way whatsoever. The duration of events are just perfect, nothing slow or boring. The tension builds nicely, but doesn't leave you waiting too long, which is hardly ever the case in most movies. This is the kind of movie I'd definitely stop to watch again if I catch it while channel surfing on cable.",Just My Luck
99,icecubepony,Liked this film - must see,10,11 July 2006,"I really liked this film.It was funny and actually (unlike most comedies) unpredictable what would happen in the end. It was another comedy like film, which was well done and I thought would be great to many age groups. Perhaps not suited to older audiences, but this film IS NOT aimed at older audiences, lets face it. Lindsey Lohan and Chris Pine both did an excellent job. The beginning perhaps was not the best done, but the film got better and better as we go on through the 1hrs and 40minutes. a Must see to anyone who likes these comedies aimed around teenagers/young adult years. It is hilarious and serves its purpose as great entertainment - believe me you will be laughing!!!!",Just My Luck
100,akarsera,somewhat spoiled by some stars' late nights,7,10 August 2006,"In spite of my ""advanced"" age I am a big McFly fan and they're the main reason I saw this movie. As musicians, their not-great-but-not-awful performances were fine as they were more or less expected but what bothered me was the only slightly better performances coming out of more developed characters- including star Lindsay Lohan. Chris Pine as 'Jake Hardin' tries his best in what I am sure he hoped would be his break-out role but Lohan never seems to get into her part as 'Ashley Albright' fully. You can almost tell she is an actress playing a role. This is never a good thing. Maybe the rumours that she spent most of the filming out partying are true. Unfortunately, it also seems that Samaire Armstrong, who plays 'Ashely's' friend 'Maggie' was out partying with her. The girl appears to be hung-over at all times! Bree Turner who plays her other friend 'Dana,' however tries really hard- after all these supporting roles, isn't it time she gets a rom-com of her own? I'm still a McFly fan and I will definitely be watching anything else Chris Pine is in but this cute story was a bit disappointing. The hopeless romantics amongst us could turn a blind eye to its failings and this is worth renting on DVD for a girlie night-in.",Just My Luck

I knew this movie wouldn't be the movie of the year... not even near. The point is that, it wasn't actually too bad, the idea was OK, but the script was too dumb, to predictable too. I think the real problem was it direction / staff in general, funny i can say, but ""forced"" to be funny, like a movie for child's.From the cast... Chris Pine does well, Lindsay Lohan too. As I've said, general problems were bad.My recommendation is, see the movie take your conclusions, it wasn't a full waste of time, I enjoyed it, it has good/funny moments, but somethings are too dumb too.",Just My Luck

I did laugh at parts of it and was amused through most of the movie although some parts were dragged out. I liked how they did the beginning showing the complete contrast in the characters head on. It was very interesting to see not only how the main characters lives changed but the people around them as their lucks changed. It has a good story line... the acting was good for the most part and you do want the boy and girl to get together in the end lol. Not to mention it was totally worth the admission fee to see Lindsay being knocked out, but don't get me wrong love her lol. But the band was great and made the movie worth watching.

Even though my standards were set pretty low, this movie was actually pretty enjoyable. Sure..just because the lucky / unlucky things had absolutely NOTHING to do with a person's luck, but their stupidity, this was a good movie for those who need a break from brain racking plots. Lohan was surprisingly very believable in this role, and it was a more adultish character for her, which actually seemed to suit her. Pine was by far my favourite; his acting not under or over done. McFly is now on my favourite bands list, even though the fact that they were trying to promote them was painfully and tiringly obvious. All in all, if you want to see something to pass the time or to have a good laugh, watch it. However, if you're not a fan of Lohan, don't bother.",Just My Luck

Lin-Lo is usually a pretty decent actress but in this movie the acting was so fake, I was dumb-founded the whole movie as to how stupid the plot line and how atrocious the acting was. The plot line was pointless. Kissing to pass luck back and forth, come one, they could've came up with something better than that don't you think? Maybe if there was an added plot line, like a 2nd reason for the movie then it wouldn't have been so bad. But all in all, do not waste your money on this crap. If you've enjoyed the other Lins-Lo movies such as Mean Girls, well, this one is not like that, this one is 10000 times worse",Just My Luck
109,flamingoes_rock422,A good movie for a girls night out!,7,31 May 2006,Although I didn't expect to like this movie I was pleasantly surprised. I am not a fan of Lindsay Lohan but this movie was pretty good. The music was excellent and the plot wasn't bad either. A few things could be changed but for a Friday night out it for filled its duty. The characters grew and developed threw out the movie. I loved the fact hey had two 'main' characters and tons of supporting characters but it didn't feel like useless information. The part when Ashley (Linsay Lohan) is in jail is somewhat stupid and when she got punched in the face I thought that it wasn't really needed and it didn't really have a point in the movie except to exaggerate her bad luck. Another part that some what ruined the 'moment' was when Ashley (Lindsay Lohan) was having trouble with the washing machine and Jake (Chris Pine) comes to help and then after he arrives his niece Katy (Makenzie Vega) jumps in the bubbles and starts playing in them. I found those two parts a waste of time and I didn't really see the point of them. But all in all I did like the movie and I believe the friends that I went with enjoyed it.

(It would seem like a commercial for McFly to me.)There were 5 (five) moments I twit a bit, but the rest of movie was totally boring. (The only one scene, where I felt some strain was when one of McFly band was trapped under the stage. (""I used to be a backup drummer for White Snake..."")). - Cca five minutes scene.So what was bad? I don't know. Chris Pine was very good, Lindsay Lohan also. McFly was funny dumb and their few song fit into film.

But they showed this movie and yeah also I like Comedys but this movie is a waste of time. There are no good jokes, no they are not even new , and the acting was very poor (ok what should we expect from those Actors). So what is about the story, let me say it is the typical girl fells in love with a boy story. So when you are seeing the opening credits, you should now how it ends. After the movie I looked in the faces of the people and I knew they all were very disappointed (ok one girl thought it was good I think, because she laughed all the time). I think they also hoped that the cinema would show us Lady Water, Superman Returns or The Breakup (all this movies will start this month in Germany).

112,yourmom_gasp,A Saturday night spent knitting is preferable to Just My Luck.,3,23 June 2006,"Just My Luck, while the previews are misleadingly charming, was deterred by its leading lady and its script. Lindsay Lohan, who is too yellow, too anorexic, and too young-looking to play this part well, recites her lines in such a way as to make the script visible in the audience's minds. However, she shines like a glow stick in a sea of dim LCD screens in comparison to her comrades---actresses Samaire Armstrong and Bree Turner---who make the feel of the movie go from poorly written flop to Barbie fairy tale (which isn't better or worse; just targeted at a different audience). The film had far too many lusty---and unlikely--- acts to be considered even remotely romantic. For instance: Ashley (Lohan) is dancing with a guy she's never met, and thirty seconds into the dance, feels a connection with this masked stranger and becomes lip-locked with him for the next . . . however long. Lusty? I think so. Next, Jake (Chris Pine) rips his pants, and somehow they fall down; a record label owner, Mr. Phillips, picks up his dog's ""poo-poo"" with a five-dollar bill; Ashley dumps too much detergent in the washing machine because she's distracted by Jake taking off his shirt; Jake automatically gets a fully-furnished apartment (complete with a full fridge and bar and satellite TV) when he gets hired by the aforementioned Mr. Phillips; Ashley wears a white coat in New York City, and it remains white (for those of you who don't know, NYC is too dirty for anything white to stay that way)... Unlikely? I think so. Ashley's high-paid boss, who turns out to be a prostitute, gets it on with Lohan's charming neighbor, who happens to be an ""escort,"" at their company's masquerade ball. Somehow, this draws the police, and Ashley is arrested. Unlikely and lusty? I think so. While some may argue and say, ""It's just a movie! Of course it has to have some unlikely factors in it!"" I reply with: ""Some? This movie was an unlikely factor."" The part that made me say (outloud, in a full theater), ""Oh my gosh"" was when Ashley realized that her luck was passed between her and Jake through kisses. She thinks he deserves it more, and since she's ""fallen"" for him (""lusted after"" more like), she has to run away via Grand Central Station, because she ""can't be around him without wanting to kiss him!"" and bursts into tears. Ridiculous? I think so. The best (and only good) part of the movie was when Jake's niece Katy is attempting to open a can of soda and it sprays into her eye. Sad? Very.",Just My Luck

I also think that Dougie is good actor even tho he didn't say much and Chris Pine is fit! Also the bit where Danny says Dougies missing his mum is funny because it would probably be true in real life. All in all I think Just My Luck is brilliant for teens that like funny stories and McFly.

Lindsay Lohan was at her best here (besides Freaky Friday and The Parent Trap), and I think Chris Pine was great. With a dash of comedy, a bit of romance, and a gallon of chick-flick, mixed together, it creates a film satisfying for a girl in search of a good movie. I especially recommend it to girls ages 13-20,and I think they'll enjoy it as much as I did. Out of ten, I give this movie seven stars. However, some scenes were just...weird for the movie.

I have loved watching Lindsay Lohan in Mean Girls and Chris Pine in the Princess Diaries 2, but seeing them together in one movie was bliss. Although you don't see Ashlee(Lohan) and Jake(Pine)communicate until like 30 minutes into the movie, you can't help but try and push them into a FAITHFUL situation.

They managed to bring out the funny parts although a few were quite lame and fake.Lindsay I would say didn't do as badly as most people think she did. I think her acting definitely passed and it was quite good. Still, I feel that in certain scenes they could have done much better on her complexion. She looked to pale.Chris was awesome.

I think that one critic said this movie was bad, and they all agreed with him! They aren't the target audience and they should remember that! The story basically is that Ashley (Lindsay) has everything then looses it in one kiss to bad luck magnet Jake (Chris), which turns out Ashley being unlucky and Jake getting all the luck.

120,SilvrRayz,"Predictable, formulaic, and almost painful to watch.",1,12 May 2006,"Watching this movie was much like driving past a horrific trainwreck or five car pile-up on the freeway. You know you shouldn't be compelled to give it more than a passing glance, but for some reason you just can't tear your eyes away.As with most romantic comedies, this plot is completely formulaic and predictable to the very end. The only real surprises are in the little things that make up the story. The script is achingly bad, it has the actors saying things that I'm sure were meant to be cute little one-liners, but it just comes out sounding dumb.Missi Pyle, always a great addition to any comedy, was great in her small role. I felt myself wishing she had more appearances, it may have made the film more funny and easier to bear. Lindsay's performance was weak, and I blame this mostly on poor direction and not lack of talent. I feel like she is still not quite ready to carry an entire romantic comedy on her own. She would have been fine in one of the supporting roles, and I think Bree Turner would have been a much more suitable choice for Lindsay's lead role.Suspension of disbelief is crucial to enjoying this movie in any way, shape, or form. Unfortunately, everybody knows that Lindsay was 18 when she made this film. It's extremely difficult to believe that Lindsay is a college graduate (they never say how recent, but one can only assume VERY recent) with a killer job at a top PR firm in Manhattan, and a chic fully furnished apartment in a very posh building with Sarah Jessica Parker as a nearby neighbor.I realize that this is meant to be a popcorn flick and nothing worthy of an Oscar or anything other than a Kid's Choice or MTV Movie award, however most other fluff movies have better writing, acting, and direction than ""Just My Luck"". I'd much rather spend my time watching a ball of fluff like ""Failure to Launch"" than this movie. Thankfully I didn't have to pay to see it.",Just My Luck

OK. thats alright i suppose. by the way, Chris Pine is quite the hottie too and missi pyle is funny and the girl who is blonde and pretty and plays lindsay's friend is funny and its funny when Lindsay gets Sarah Jessica Parker's dress and her boo asks ""where did you get that gorgeous dress?"" and she says in this really funny voice ""don't ask"" i love her.",Just My Luck

124,smashey77,Pretty Good. Good Luck!,8,3 January 2009,"Just My Luck isn't that bad. I like Lohan's movies. Light, simple, Disney-like, and cute. If you want something mature, you're looking in the wrong section. This movie is for the 23 year old or younger. But adults will find the amusement in the trials of growing up for young kids today.That said, both Lohan and Pine's characters are likable. They don't do drugs, swear too often, or do indecent things. They're pretty ideal and moralistic. What's not to like about that?Their story is based on their dreams and careers. Sure, Lohan went from big office lady to a bowling janitor, but that's JUST her LUCK! Funny irony. Pine got the LUCK but does good just the way he usually does. And Lohan learns to sacrifice. What's not to like about that?The music is good. Fun and upbeat pace. I barely knew how long/short this movie was. Just flew by and I enjoyed every minute. What's not to like about that?The story is simple. Girl has all the luck. Fate played a cruel joke on her. Luck goes to the unluckiest guy. Guy does good for himself while doing good for the now-unlucky girl. They fall in love. Guy and girl learn and perform sacrifice and gives luck to a young unlucky girl. end of story, audience feels good, we go home and embrace our blessings. What's not to like about that?I enjoyed this movie so much I may pop it into my DVD quite often. it's not overly-serious or overly-moral. It's just light and uplifting. It's a good Lohan movie and a really impressive Pine movie. I'd recommend it. Just think Disney. It's all good.",Just My Luck
125,pervy_hobbit_fancier_,Remains cheesy and up-beat... what else did you expect?!,7,4 September 2006,"In watching movies like ""Just My Luck"", one of the many problems with reviewers is that they take the movie too seriously. Also, major magazine or newspaper reviewers take THEMSELVES too seriously, and forget that their ""high-brow"" and ""intelligent"" opinion often isn't shared by many movie-goers. Plus, you can also get a middle-aged man looking at a movie that's Blatantly aimed at teenage girls. Just remember with reviews that it's only ONE person's opinion  to really judge a film, you need to see it yourself.Anyway, let's look at ""Just My Luck""  its main star is Lindsey Lohan, well known for feel-good, teen movies. No one's looking for something ground-breaking and deeply thoughtful with her movies, are they?! The plot line is simple enough too  The luckiest woman in the world accidentally swaps luck with the unluckiest man in the world, and hilarious scenarios follow as she tries to get her luck back. An interesting idea, which does have some brilliant comedy moments (Chris Pine's introduction to the audience, to name one), but the some of the ""hilarious scenarios"" Lohan goes through can sometimes just be traced back to plain stupidity, such as putting a contact lens directly back into her eye after it falls into a cat litter tray, or trying to use a floor waxer in stiletto sandals! I mean, come on!! Then again, maybe there was a subliminal message there, saying that most bad luck comes from bad intelligence though probably not.There is another factor to consider for this movie  the appearance of the popular British pop-band, McFly, who play themselves and, in the movie, are managed by Chris Pine. Something to take into account is that this movie was mainly an attempt to launch McFly in America, and then cash-in back in England when their fan base flocked to the cinemas to watch their idols on the screen. Oddly enough though, for a film that's supposed to promote the band in America, it really fails to do this, by implying that the band do not write their own music. McFly pride themselves on writing all their own music (of which, only three songs get played repeatedly in an annoying start-stop-restart-stop fashion that you'll be yelling for earplugs into the first 20 minutes). It is also not made clear that the band is actually a real one either  many of the audiences left thinking that the band existed only in the movie-world, like Josie and the Pussycats or Spinal Tap.Another mistake in hiring McFly is that out of the four members of the band, it appears that only two of them can actually act - Danny Jones and Dougie Poynter (though Poynter only says a grand total of about 9 words in the entire movie) - while the other two, Tom Fletcher and Harry Judd, remain as wooden as a set of Judd's drumsticks. Then again, McFly are musicians at the end of the day, not actors, so perhaps it's unfair to judge them so strictly on their acting skills.That said, perhaps Fletcher and Judd's performances could be slightly due to the script, which has some truly awful dialogue at moments that all the actors on screen struggle to get their tongues around. And while McFly have the justification of being a band first, actors second, there's no excuse for Lohan, who has some appalling moments (her opening scenes are cringe-worthy), and is woefully miscast as a highly successful, mid-20's woman, when she looks like she's only just stepped out of high-school. Chris Pine makes up for this though, as the completely likable and optimistic S.O.L (!) manager of McFly.Like with any movie that's hailing Lindsey Lohan as it's main star, you should never expect too much from it, other than a cheesy, happy teen-movie. ""Just My Luck"" is let down by bad acting and lines, but overall, it has a feel-good vibe going, and doesn't take itself seriously, which is a fantastic thing to see in a movie today, and it serves this film well (though people might like to look out for the luck symbolism that is subtly scattered throughout the film, such as how Pine's apartment is ""unlucky"" number 13). It also has some moments that are genuinely laugh-out-loud (rather kindly, this film caters not only for fans, but also people who violently dislike Lohan or McFly and enjoy seeing them in pain / awkward situations). If you fail to crack a smile even once throughout this movie, then there's no hope for you in general. Ignore your prejudice and just go with it.7 stars out of 10.",Just My Luck
126,mono-culata,Lindsay stinks,4,10 June 2006,"This movie would have been much more enjoyable if the lead actress was someone other than Lindsay Lohan. I don't have that much against her, I just didn't think she was a very good actress in this movie. The story was predictable (I'm not sure if that is a spoiler or not, but I'm putting a warning because being blacklisted doesn't sound too fun), but most romantic comedies are about the journey, not the end result. I laughed at quite a few parts, although not because of the great acting--they were simply cases of falling down, getting electrocuted, etc. I wish I would have just rented this movie instead of wasting so much money at the theater.",Just My Luck
127,ber-wie,way under its possibilities,3,31 July 2006,"Well, I must say, I would have never ever watched that movie, but it was on a sneak preview, so I had to watch it.Just my Luck starts out with Lohan's character being a very lucky girl. She has luck in everything she does. Chris Pine's character on the other hand is the opposite. When they accidentally kiss, their luck switches. After she realises what happened she tries to get her luck back, but falls in love with him and learns that luck isn't everything.Well, while this plot could have been a set up for various comedic situations and possibilities there is really nothing more to it. She eventually gets her luck back, wow. While I didn't like the movie because the gags seem old and the plot is very foreseeable, I really did like the concept. Why not play around a little with the luck-switching and kiss. Have his character kiss somebody else, have him realize that and then both chase the luck. Have him kiss a dog or whatever, just bring some life in this dead piece of movie. Set up some funnier comedic situations. This movie is pretty straight-forward, there are no emotions (even the love story doesn't seem right), no conflicts and not twists or turns. (Ya right, as if it seems realistic that Lohan's character realises that she's egoistic in just 1 second). And the dialogue tends to be boring.Lohan's acting is alright and she looks as good as always on screen. Chris Pine's character is the typical loser but when he doesn't wear his glasses he suddenly looks like a super hottie. The band is the typical cliché punk/alternative/whatever rock band. The supporting cast is alright.There are some minor plot holes in the movies, but after all it's pretty straight-forward. When Lohan has the luck all the people around her are unlucky, but when Pine has the luck all the people around him are also lucky. And when the band is struggling all of the sudden one of Lohan's friends is a musician and can help out, without mentioning it before in the movie (maybe a deleted scene, that shouldn't have been deleted).All in all, if you are looking for a good romantic comedy, then you are at the wrong movie. Maybe a younger audience will like it. I hope Lindsay Lohan will get the chance to play in better comedies than this one. The concept was a nice idea but the conversion to a movie just did not succeed.3 1/2 out of 10",Just My Luck
128,lsettem,one the worst,1,19 August 2006,"This film is one of the worst films that's been made in some time.Some of the actors performs OK,but the story is just so dull and a big clichéd.And the worst performance of them all comes from the main character,which is overacting at a supreme level.I simply couldn't believe what I saw.I find it unimaginable that a production company is willing to spend this much money on such a awful project.And it fills me with anger knowing that there are several great script,that will never will be produced.But seeing that the film is a professional and somewhat well made,I pity the crew who had to go through the agonizing experience this must have been.",Just My Luck
129,lost-in-translation,A very unbiased review.,10,10 May 2006,"""Wow."" That's the only thing I could think after I saw this stellar comedy. Color me surprised; I had no idea what a delightful young actress Lohan has become! As you could probably tell from the trailer, this film has a very fresh and unique premise. The plot is very reminiscent of Woody Allen's early work, and I believe the screenwriters (including Marlene King, National Lampoon's Senior Trip) will have very promising futures. I don't want to give anything away, but let's just say Lindsay Lohan has a lot of good luck until she kisses a stranger at a party, and the stranger actually TAKES her luck. And get this: the guy (Chris Pine) was a bad luck magnet up until that moment! Needless to say, things begin to get a little complicated for our young protagonist. Will she get her luck back? Will she and the stranger fall in love, despite the inevitable conflict that will arise about 2/3 into the movie? You'll have to see for yourself, but take my word for it...you'll be pleasantly surprised!",Just My Luck
130,piano_boy,It serves its purpose.,8,12 May 2006,"I've been reading a lot of negative reviews about this movie and I think it's kind of ridiculous that people are bashing it as if it was expected to be some Oscar Award winning picture. This is not a movie for critics, nor is it a movie for people who don't like Lindsay Lohan. If you fall into this category, you shouldn't be reviewing or even watching the movie.JUST MY LUCK is a comedy that falls somewhere in between a romantic-comedy, teen-comedy, and Disney-comedy. As a movie, it definitely has its flaws (like it's attempt to be a promotional launch for the band McFly), but I have never seen a movie that tries to appeal to as many people as possible that doesn't have flaws.Lohan is entertaining both as the lucky-girl and unlucky-girl, and she's easy to watch on screen. It's no MEAN GIRLS, but it's not as juvenile as FREAKY Friday or HERBIE, so I think it's another fine addition to Lohan's resume.Bottom line is that if you enjoy mainstream ""no-brainer"" entertainment, you will likely enjoy this movie. JUST MY LUCK doesn't attempt to be anything other than a comedy with mass appeal to easy going individuals. No deep and artistic meaningful content? Who cares! Since when are we expecting that from a movie like this? JUST MY LUCK serves it's purpose, and I don't think it's a movie you should completely ignore because of negative reviews from critics and Lohan-haters. See it for yourself.Final Note: If you think every one liner and funny moment is in the trailer, you'll be pleasantly surprised. :)",Just My Luck

To be honest, I didn't expect a whole lot out of this movie, but it seriously blew me away. The writers, director, and of course actors deserve to win academy awards. I think that the writing is superb, and it's a great storyline that can appeal to a wide range of people, myself included. The part at the end when she fell in love with the guy caused me to lose it.

Lindsay Lohan is a lot less annoying in movies than she is out of the picture. The plot was predictable and everyone knows that it's all going to work out for everyone. It's a movie for preteens. It's good for a mindless night at the movies if you're really desperate for a movie that doesn't require much thinking. The acting was kind of lame. Neither Lohan or Pine showed much sincerity in their roles, most of the movie seemed like a high budget high school production.

It's a ridiculous idea for a movie. So I knew it was going to be bad, but I didn't know how extremely and hilariously bad it would be. All the extremely girly squealing. The ridiculous amounts of luck Lindsay has at the beginning. Some of the purely ridiculous lines, like ""I'll be the red-head who looks like me"". The man prostitutes. The stupidity of Lindsay's character. And best of all, that hilarious, fantastically hysterical ending shot, which left me in TEARS at how crazy and random it was.

139,ttownrobin729,"""Just My Luck"" is up to par with ""The Parent Trap"" & MUCH BETTER THAN ""..Drama Queen""",8,3 September 2006,"In response/comparison to the comment by ""Lily-32 from Utah""/""AL"":I TOO, admit three things - in regards to the Lindsey Lohan movie 'Just my Luck"":1) I am a Lindsey Lohan fan beyond my control. It's in my young-at-heart genes to love teen movies. I am a young 46 years old. I TRY not to like her because of her frequent over-acting, AND she gets enough attention. She doesn't need me.. As well as my jealousy of her perfect body and gorgeous hair; her ""perfectness"" aspires me to be like her and at the same time, bugs the heck out of me...but I have to admit: SHE IS AN EXCELLENT ACTRESS, as well as breathtakingly beautiful. Thin, plump, she always looks great. (except for in blonde hair..)Her other movies in comparison: ""The Parent Trap"" showcased her acting abilities at a very young age. ""Confessions..."", you could tell, was a ""contract-induced-movie' they seemed to spit out to keep Ms. Lohan's exposure up. ""Freaky Friday"" exhibited her acting abilities even more and proved that she was a young adult acting force to be dealt with. She, at that time, also entered into her new title of ""Teen Queen"". ""Mean Girls"", another seemingly contract-induced-movie, proved to be well beyond ""Confessions"" in likability, due to an excellently written script and other talented actresses in the cast, though that too, was another of Lohan's overly acted-in movies. ""Herby"" just looked stupid/childish to me so I never have seen it. Blame that on the overly-advertised previews. BUT ENOUGH ABOUT HER THE OTHER MOVIES - I am merely trying to explain why THIS movie turned out to be another Lindsey Lohan movie I intend to purchase for my own collection. (but at half.com - not EVER at full price!) 2) Again, I agree with ""AL"" on the comment that the previews for ""Just My Luck"" left quite a bit to be desired, by showing the same clips over and over...making one think that those were the best parts of the movie and that was it. BUT I, ON THE OTHER HAND, was still very interested in seeing it, merely due to the fact that it was a Lindsey Lohan movie. On the other hand, The total LACK of advertising for her other current movie ""Prairie Home Companion"" (regardless of whether the great Meryl Streep is in it or not - I can't even believe I SAID THAT!!) led me to believe it must be a real tanker. I'll catch that one when it hits the $1.00 rentals.3) I had NO IDEA that Chris Pine (the romantic lead in this movie) was in Princess Diaries 2, because THAT movie was so terrible I couldn't even watch the whole thing, though I ADORE Anne Hathaway (SEE ""The Other Side of Heaven - WONDERFUL!). I personally do not think he is good looking enough to be a romantic lead. Too Geeky looking and a terrible haircut.LIKE ""AL"": That said, I ended up loving ""Just My Luck."" Call me crazy and say I have no taste. I don't care. ""I came for the 'Teen Queen', I stayed for the movie.""Was this an award winning movie? No. I agree. But maybe at the MTV Awards, at least. She could bring it home for best kiss in a movie. Why does it have to be an older actor or an ultra-drama, rather than entertaining, to be nominated for an Academy Award?Did it have flaws? Yes. I agree with ""AL"" about the freeze-frame. BUT WHO REALLY CARES ABOUT ALL THAT. GEES-O-PETES!!AGREEING AGAIN with ""AL"": Overall - considering my opinion on Miss Lohan in general - I was pleasantly surprised by her in this movie. She's DEFINITELY another Julia Roberts to me. I am and always shall be - a real fan.HONORABLE MENTION: I loved the band: ""McFly""! My next thing to do is search to see if they are a real band. Either that, or see if they have a song or two on the soundtrack to ""Just My Luck"". BUT PLEASE, DO NOT READ ""AL""'s review IF YOU HAVE NOT YET SEEN THE MOVIE - IT TOTALLY GIVES THE ENTIRE MOVIE AWAY!! ENDING AND ALL!Last, but not least, I gave this movie an eight, because to me, ""Out of Africa"" and ""One True Thing"" with Meryl Streep, or ""Terms of Endearment"" with Debra Winger and Shirley Maclaine are tens. Maybe, they're right; maybe the actresses have to be a bit older to be nominated for an Oscar...TTR (TTown Robin)",Just My Luck

143,PirateFear,"Very surprising, in a very good way.",10,6 May 2006,"OK...So what are you expecting to read here, 'typical yet enjoyable romcom fair' well forget it. This film goes so much deeper than that.Firstly forget all the glossy Hollywood love stuff, if you look deeper than that, read between the lines, see into the true heart of the script, hear what's NOT being said, then you'll fully understand what this film is all about.The underlying political and social commentary inherent through this entire film is stunning, accurate and touching, it alludes to deeper thoughts and emotions than any film has dared to aim for in the past 50 years. The subtext of the film embraces unity and peace in troubled times throughout the world. Difficult to believe coming from a standard looking Lohan affair yes? Well you'll have to see it to believe it.Lohan herself puts in a stellar performance and it leads only to aiding you in seeing what's really going on here. The educated among you will spot the references to higher philosophical planes of being, only (unbelieveably) given weight by Lohan's performance. Who would have thought that you would come away from this film refreshed and inspired by the words of it's actors? See this for yourself, I urge you, I beg you. If you want to experience the full force of it's truth, you can't rely on my words. Never has a film had such an impact on me.A stunning film, with a stunning message, fantastically executed. A must see.",Just My Luck
144,sofie0606,Just my luck!,4,3 July 2006,"This movie is about a girl who's very lucky, and one day looses her luck to a very unfortunate boy.I think Freaky Friday and Mean Girls are much better than this! The story's too thin and the characters are not funny... Lindsay is a great actress and that's the only reason i didn't rate this movie 1! I usually like romantic/teen/chick flick movies but not this one. I would't recommend anyone to see it in a theater, you should only see it if you like Lindsay Lohan, but don't expect a movie as great as Mean Girls... Can anyone recommend a movie that's similar to Mean Girls, Clueless etc... I really love those kind of movies:-)",Just My Luck
145,teenqueenlindsay,Perfect!,10,13 May 2006,"This movie has such a good scrip, cast, and crew that made it the perfect film it is today! This is a great kick-off to Lindsay Lohan's adult role's. This is some of her best work. I am more excited about Lindsay Lohan's upcoming work than ever before. I think this will be top of the box's office. Hail this film. Chris Pine's performance is also very good. This is better than his work in The Princess Diaries 2. The rest of the cast is also very surprising in their performances too. I was shocked at how good this film was put together. I would see this film over and over again. I think this film will beat Posiden in the box's office this week. Go see Just My Luck.",Just My Luck
